50|$|The {{temple of}} Shri Antariksha Parshvanath {{is also known}} as the Basti Mandir. This temple {{is said to have been}} rebuilt about 250 years ago.The {{principal}} idol of this temple is a 3.6 feet tall black stone idol of Antariksha Parshvanath in padmasana position with a hood of cobras. It is believed that the idol was in a floating position in the past and has come to rest on ground at only one point that is the little finger of one of the foot. However, a plausible explanation of its position as it appears to the human eye is that the idol is <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> at one point and is balanced in such a way that its entire weight is supported at that point. The principal interest about the same is that except for one point the entire idol is floating, and is hence called antariksha.This miraculous idol was found in the year 1142 and installed in temple by Acharya Abhaydevsurishvarji. It is believed this sand idol was made by Mali and Sumali, the servants of Khaldusan, the brother-in-law of King Ravan.Other idols are in white marble said to be 300 to 400 years old. An ancient image of Anantanatha Tirthankara is also present here. By the side of the image of Anantanatha Tirthankara are carved images of the 14 Tirthankaras. The image of Anantanatha contains an inscription said to be in Brahmi characters. There is an altar of the Goddess Padmavati, the image of Padmavati prepared about a century ago using white marble.|$|E

Such virtual routers would {{have the potential to}} open up whole new business models for ISPs or even to provide multiple concurrent network architectures on a single shared physical network. In this paper we explore the design of a flexible and performant virtual router architecture running modern x 86 rackmount systems. Each virtual router <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> virtualization platform can be independently managed, with the goal being to achieve near-optimal forwarding while still providing inter-router isolation and the flexibility to run nonstandard forwarding code. The difficulty lies in balancing performance, flexibility and isolation. We examine the issue of how well suited the new commodity hardware architectures are for full router virtualization. By exploring the performance limitations and their causes we hope to scope the debate regarding this rapidly expanding area of research with some real data. Beyond this, we aim to examine the trends in PC architecture to foresee their impact on virtual routers, and infer where the use of such routers might be, or become, appropriate. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a method and apparatus for measuring emitted vibrational forces produced by a reaction wheel assembly due to imbalances, misalignment, bearing defects and the like. The apparatus includes a low mass carriage supported on a large mass base. The carriage {{is in the form}} of an octagonal frame having an opening which is adapted for receiving the reaction wheel assembly supported thereon by means of a mounting ring. The carriage is <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> by means of air bearings which support the carriage in a generally frictionless manner when supplied with compressed air from a source. A plurality of carriage brackets and a plurality of base blocks provided for physical coupling of the base and carriage. The sensing axes of the load cells are arranged generally parallel to the base and connected between the base and carriage such that all of the vibrational forces emitted by the reaction wheel assembly are effectively transmitted through the sensing axes of the load cells. In this manner, a highly reliable and accurate measurment of the vibrational forces of the reaction wheel assembly can be had. The output signals from the load cells are subjected to a dynamical analyzer which analyzes and identifies the rotor and spin bearing components which are causing the vibrational forces...|$|E
40|$|A {{sapphire}} resonator for an ultrastable oscillator {{capable of}} substantial performance improvements over {{the best available}} crystal quartz oscillators in a compact cryogenic package {{is based on a}} compensation mechanism enabled by the difference between copper and sapphire thermal expansion coefficients for so tuning the resonator as to cancel the temperature variation of the sapphire's dielectric constant. The sapphire resonator consists of a sapphire ring separated into two parts with webs on the outer end of each to form two re-entrant parts which are separated by a copper post. The re-entrant parts are bonded to the post by indium solder for good thermal conductivity between parts of that subassembly which is <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> plate of a closed copper cylinder (rf shielding casing) by a thin stainless steel cylinder. A unit for temperature control is placed in the stainless steel cylinder and is connected to the subassembly of re-entrant parts and copper post by a layer of indium for good thermal conduction. In normal use, the rf shielding casing is placed in a vacuum tank which is in turn placed in a thermos flask of liquid nitrogen. The temperature regulator is controlled from outside the thermos flask to a temperature in a range of about 40 K to 150 K, such as 87 K for the WGH- 811, mode of resonance in response to microwave energy inserted into the rf shielding casing through a port from an outside source...|$|E

The performance of each indicator has been evaluated in an experimental context to produce realistic test cases, using a trip planning tool and a demand generator. First, the behaviour of the indicators is analysed with regard to the time windows width planned for the service. Then, their ability in estimating the total transportation cost to satisfy all the requests, under different time period profiles, is shown. The results confirm the ability of the set of indicators to predict with a good approximation the transportation costs and therefore to be used in supporting the service quality planning decisions...|$|R

In this study, a band-limited white-noise wave was generated as follows. A frequency range from 1.0 to 8.0  Hz was adopted considering the responsive characteristics of the nailed plywood-timber joints under harmonic waves [1] and the general distribution of base shear spectra of most seismic waves [6, 7]. A flat white-noise wave of this frequency range was substituted with a composite wave of discrete frequency components of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0  Hz.

40|$|Density {{functional}} theory (DFT) calculations {{have been}} performed to gain insight {{into the role of}} defects present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of graphene and TiO₂ based <b>supports</b> <b>on</b> <b>supported</b> metal clusters. <b>The</b> clusters considered are a Pt₃₈ cluster and a bimetallic Pt₃₂Pd₆ alloy. <b>The</b> defects considered <b>on</b> graphene based <b>supports</b> are monovacancy defective graphene, OH and COOH functionalised graphene. <b>The</b> defects considered <b>on</b> TiO₂ based <b>supports</b> are a partially reduced TiO₂(110) surface with a surface oxygen bridge vacancy and hydroxylated TiO₂(110) surface with surface OH groups. The defect free graphene and TiO₂ surfaces were also considered. For both the Pt₃₈ and Pt₃₂Pd₆ cluster, and on both defect containing graphene and TiO₂ (except on hydroxylated TiO₂(110) surface) the binding of the clusters is enhanced relative to binding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defect free <b>supports.</b> Enhanced binding at the defects imply that the clusters are bound strongly to the support and thus less likely to detach from the support material relative to binding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defect free <b>supports.</b> Therefore, the defects may improve the durability of the catalyst by limiting particle detachment. The electronic properties of the cluster are modified differently depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> identity of <b>the</b> defect present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>support.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> graphene <b>based</b> <b>supports,</b> OH functionalisation is expected to result in weaker binding energy of adsorbate molecules, whereas COOH functionalisation is expected to result in stronger binding energy of adsorbates for the supported Pt₃₈ cluster. This is due to different shifts in d-band centre of <b>the</b> facets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cluster <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> these <b>supports.</b> Therefore, it can be expected that <b>the</b> Pt₃₈ cluster <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> OH functionalised graphene will be more tolerant to poison molecules. This is due to reduced binding strength of adsorbates on OH functionalised graphene compared to adsorption on COOH functionalised graphene. For the Pt₃₂Pd₆ cluster the OH and COOH functional groups do not appreciably modify the d-band centre of the facets available to reactants, and thus is expected not to significantly modify the binding strength of adsorbate molecules relative to binding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> free unsupported Pt₃₂Pd₆ cluster. The binding energy of adsorbate molecules <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pt₃₈ cluster <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> defect containing TiO₂ is expected to be stronger than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pt₃₈ cluster <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> defective graphene based supports, due to higher extent of upward shift of the d-band centre of the exposed facets. The enhanced binding energy of adsorbates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pt₃₈ cluster <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> TiO₂ <b>supports</b> may be detrimental to catalyst durability and activity. This can be due to strong binding of poison molecules and reaction intermediates which maybe too strongly bound <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface such that they cannot participate in further reaction steps. Overall it might turn out that <b>the</b> functionalised graphene <b>based</b> supports are better support materials over <b>the</b> TiO₂ <b>based</b> materials for particular reactions. The Nb-doped partially reduced TiO₂(110) surface attaches the Pt₃₂Pd₆ cluster strongly to the support compared to the functionalised graphene supports. Furthermore, the binding energy of adsorbate molecules is expected to be weaker <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pt₃₂Pd₆ cluster <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Nbdoped partially reduced TiO₂(110) surface compared to the functionalised graphene supports. This might be beneficial as poison molecules may be weakly bound to the cluster resulting in high resistance to poisoning which can also {{have a positive effect on}} catalyst activity. In addition to enhancing binding of the cluster to the support and affecting the binding energy of adsorbates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>supported</b> clusters, some of the defects can also alter the ordering pattern of Pd and Pt atoms within the Pt₃₂Pd₆ cluster. OH functionalised graphene and Nbdoped partially reduced TiO₂(110) surface result in segregation of Pd towards the clustersupport interface, thereby exposing more Pt atoms at the surface facets of the cluster. The modified arrangement of Pt and Pd atoms may result in modification of the reactivity of the Pt₃₂Pd₆ cluster. The results of this study indicate that the defects can play a vital role in determining the activity and durability of the catalyst. By having the right combination of defects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> material, the durability and catalytic activity of the catalyst can be fine-tuned simultaneously. This can lead to better design of catalysts...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} drive in a safe and {{environmentally}} friendly manner a driver needs <b>support</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> skillbased, rule <b>based</b> and knowledge based level (Rasmussen, 1986). It {{can be argued that}} today's driverinformation mainly supports skill and rule <b>based</b> levels while <b>the</b> complex task of driving also needssupport <b>on</b> <b>the</b> knowledge <b>based</b> level, e. g. problem solving. The aim {{of this study was to}} identifyways to support problem solving and decision making in a driving information context and to studygaps, overlaps, strong and weak relations between the driver information functions and the purpose ofthe functions. Work Domain Analysis (WDA) (Vicente, 1999) was used to decompose the purpose of the driverinformation down to the component level. WDA is the first step of five in Cognitive Work Analysis(CWA). CWA belongs to the category of Ecological Interface Design that aims to aid the design ofhuman centred interfaces and systems that support problem solving and decision making in complexsocio-technical systems. The study was performed by researchers from Luleå University of Technology and Volvo Cars as wellas members of a Driving information project. The study was limited to driver information systems inprivate cars which means that the main purpose of the systems was to support drivers' goals e. g. navigate or maintain speed but also being environment friendly, etc. It should also be mentioned thatdriver information not only was limited to information within the car. Before and after driving was alsoincluded. The WDA identified five functional purposes of driving information: To support safe,efficient, environment friendly, legal and enjoyable transportation. The "Functional purpose" was decomposed into "abstract functions" e. g. support choice oftransportation, reduce energy exposure, improve friction, and maintain lateral and longitudinal distance. Further decomposition down to "physical form" showed several weak and some unexpected relationsbetween the purpose and the system. For instance, one conclusion was that the relation betweenspeedometer and safety was weak. The weak relations and the gaps then served as input for designimplications. In the design implications part it was concluded that planning could be improved in comparison withtoday's systems by e. g. internet services and pre- and post-trip information. New features in thenavigation system, such as route optimization based on safety or carbon footprint, could improve bothsafety and environmental friendliness. Feedback or Edutainment (Education by Entertainment) couldalso serve as a way to improve safety and green driving. A rather controversial and perhaps unrealisticsuggestion is that a private car could provide statistics or data about safety, environmental friendlinessor efficiency (Cost) for different types of transportation in order to make the choice of transportationoptimized. Another, more general conclusion is that the decomposition also showed the importance for a designerto ask the question "why?" when designing a product. Godkänd; 2009; 20091216 (biem...|$|R
40|$|Current {{techniques}} for manual and automated determination of decametre-range are reviewed from information gained by extensive literature search and from visits {{made to a}} wide cross section of European establishments concerned with large-scale dimensional measurements. The reviews, which contain nearly 200 references, provide background information needed by systems designers. A 12 m steel measuring base is described which was length stabilised to within 3 parts in 10 for periods in excess of 500 hours. Temperature of the internal water flow is monitored by a contact thermometer which controls the heat input. The {{theory and practice of}} tensioned-wire dimensional transducers are given which enables this new-class of dimensional measuring instrument to be designed. Two distinct groups of instrument described are those for transducing continuous length changes into electrical signals with better than 5 parts in 10 ^ 6 error and those for detecting changes of 1 part in 10 ^ 10 or smaller, of a nominally fixed length. Continuous subdivision transducers with 12 m and 1 m range are reported which incorporate mechanical mechanisms for obtaining adjustable absolute length, reduction of in-scale accuracy, errors, linear rotary output, rapid following response and simple temperature compensation. A method and practical apparatus are described which uses this type of transducer for automatic control of the position of a workhea moved on a cartesian-frame manipulator. Actual two-dimensional position is measured on a trilateral basis, a technique which eliminates the need for a massive framework when machining or inspecting large workpieces. In-situ numerically-controlled machining is possible with this system. A second frameless technique is described for automatically recording roundness variations of large rings or spigots. Repeatability of 5 parts in 10 ^ 6 or better has been proven to be possible with inexpensive equipment. This method illustrates the use of deformation wire-transducers for dynamic dimensional measurement. A similar type of instrument was used for creep determination of invariwires and carbon-fibres <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 12 m <b>base.</b> Results are given which have shown that 1 part in 10 ^ 8 length stability is attainable over considerable periods. It is shown that measurement of earth strains is possible with an invar wire tensioned by a simple beam-balance. Details are given of an experiment performed in a tunnel in which solid-earth tidal strains are recorded within hours of installation. Several other possible applications are discussed for which tensioned-wire transducers seem suited. The use of position-sensitive photocells in dimensional metrology is outlined with particular reference to wire transducers where linear and rotary movements may need monitoring. It is shown that they are a simple and economic way to measure small displacements of millimetre range...|$|R

40|$|The {{category}} of Hilbert modules {{may be interpreted}} as a naive quantum field theory over a base space.
