The birds are often found on the beaches {{along the coast of}} the Oxnard plain. Their nests are hard to see in the open sand and the birds are easily frightened away by human activity leaving the eggs to fast-moving predators such as sea gulls. Least terns were another endangered species of bird that was a concern during the cleanup efforts.|$|E

25|$|From 37 BCE to 6 CE, the Herodian dynasty, Jewish-Roman client kings, {{descended from}} Antipater, ruled Judea. Herod the Great {{considerably}} enlarged the temple (see Herod's Temple), {{making it one}} of the largest religious structures in the world. Despite its fame, it was in this period that Rabbinical Judaism, led by Hillel the Elder, began to assume popular prominence over the Temple priesthood. The Jewish Temple in Jerusalem was granted special permission not to display an effigy of the emperor, becoming the only religious structure in the Roman Empire that did not do <b>so.</b> <b>Special</b> dispensation was granted for Jewish citizens of the Roman Empire to pay a tax to the temple.|$|E

25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, the cold-box process uses a binder that is {{hardened}} {{through the use}} of special gases. The binder coated sand is packed into a core box and then sealed so that a curing gas can be introduced. These gases are often toxic (i.e. amine gas) or odorous (i.e. SO2), <b>so</b> <b>special</b> handling systems must be used. However, because high temperatures are not required the core box can be made from metal, wood, or plastic. An added benefit is that hollow core can be formed if the gas is introduced via holes in the core surface which cause only the surface of the core to harden; the remaining sand is then just dumped out to be used again. For example, a cold-box sand casting core binder is sodium silicate which hardens on exposure to carbon dioxide.|$|E

500|$|The creature's {{appearance}} {{was inspired by}} {{an image of a}} woman with a henna-tattooed back that Kripke found on the internet. He thought it would be intriguing to have the villain's entire body tattooed. The actor who portrayed the djinnMackenzie Grayhad a shaved head, <b>so</b> <b>special</b> effects makeup artist Toby Lindala only used a minor prosthetic to cover Gray's eyebrows. Lindala found the tattoos to be a [...] "particular challenge" [...] because they were [...] "intricate designs". [...] The production schedule could not accommodate the six hours needed to apply the makeup each day, so the actor was booked with the condition that the make-up not be removed for four days. Gray's personal life was affected by this, as people on the street were scared by his appearance. Lindala was surprised that Gray was able to keep the tattoos undamaged outside of filming.|$|E

Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|Black Sabbath {{began work}} on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England at Morgan Studios in Willesden, {{this time with a}} decisive vision to differ the sound from Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath. [...] "We could've {{continued}} and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else which we didn't particularly want to. We took a look at ourselves, and we wanted to do a rock album – Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath wasn't a rock album, really." [...] Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher, Sabotage was released in July 1975. As with its precursor, the album initially saw favourable reviews, with Rolling Stone stating [...] "Sabotage is not only Black Sabbath's best record since Paranoid, it might be their best ever", although later reviewers such as AllMusic noted that [...] "the magical chemistry that made such albums as Paranoid and Volume 4 <b>so</b> <b>special</b> was beginning to disintegrate".|$|E

500|$|The railway {{is single}} track, <b>so</b> <b>special</b> {{measures}} {{have to be}} taken to prevent collisions. Before preservation, the railway operated a [...] "one engine in steam" [...] policy, but with growing passenger numbers it became necessary to install passing loops and a more stringent method of single line control was introduced. The line is worked by Electric Key tokens, which authorise the driver to enter a section of single line, and these are interlocked to prevent more than one token being withdrawn for a section at any one time. There is a loop at Pendre, which was used from the opening of the railway for shunting purposes, and further loops were installed at Brynglas in 1953 and Quarry Siding in 1963. When the Nant Gwernol extension opened in 1976, Abergynolwyn also became a passing loop. Between Abergynolwyn and Nant Gwernol the line is controlled by staff and ticket operation, which is controlled by the Abergynolwyn Blockman when on Duty.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Chad Grischow {{said the}} group charged [...] "full steam ahead with the most rock focused album of their career".

In a brief review for Newsday, Glenn Gamboa {{said it was a}} [...] "testament" [...] to the group's talent that they can [...] "turn essentially a transition album into something that sounds this good". PopMatters reviewer Kiel Hauck wrote that Lazzara and Nolan's call-and-response vocals, featured on the group's debut, were placed [...] "perfect throughout the record" [...] as the pair [...] "create a beautiful combination that serves as a reminder of what made this band <b>so</b> <b>special</b> in the first place". Tori Pederson of Punknews.org {{said the group}} [...] "sound like a well-oiled machine here," [...] producing [...] "arguably the best album of their career" [...] in the process.

500|$|In late 1966, Redding {{returned}} to the Stax studio and recorded several tracks, including [...] "Try a Little Tenderness", written by Jimmy Campbell, Reg Connelly and Harry M. Woods in 1932.

[...] Today often considered his signature song, [...] Jim Stewart reckoned, [...] "If there's one song, one performance that really sort of sums up Otis and what he's about, it's 'Try a Little Tenderness'. [...] That one performance is <b>so</b> <b>special</b> and so unique that it expresses who he is." [...] On this version Redding was backed by Booker T. & the M.G.'s, while staff producer Isaac Hayes worked on the arrangement. [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] was included on his next album, [...] [...] The song and the album were critically and commercially successful—the former peaked at number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and at number 4 on the R chart.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] is a {{complimentary}} love song that contains [...] "curse" [...] words and a repetitive chorus.

[...] Maz Halima of Flavour Magazine described the track as a [...] "serene song". [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] contains the line [...] "And you my lover / But I love you like a brother" [...] which, according to Popdust's Exton, is reminiscent of actress Angelina Jolie and her brother James Haven at the Oscars. Exton further explained that the song is full with vague descriptions of Rihanna's feelings, which result as [...] "hollow" [...] declaration that she is never going away.

500|$|In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under {{the name}} Cheryl LaPiere) and Georganne, and {{enrolled}} them at Montclair College Preparatory School, {{a private school}} in Encino, whose students were mostly from affluent families. The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, [...] " [...] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality." [...] A former classmate commented, [...] "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was <b>so</b> <b>special...</b> She was like a movie star, right then and there...

She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. She later recalled, [...] "I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous." ...|$|E
