40|$|Replicating Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA {{molecules}} {{isolated from}} superinfected Raji cells {{were shown to}} consist of 80 S to 65 S and 58 S (mature) molecules Pulse-chase experiments showed that radioactive label of DNAS molecules with the larger sedimentation coefficients was partially chased into 58 S labeled forms. Formation of large concatemers of viral DNA could not be detected at any time after superinfection. The continuous presence of the 65 S viral DNA intermediate throughout the replicative cycle combined with the observed inhibition of EBV DNA synthesis by addition of nontoxic levels of ethidium bromide to the <b>superinfected</b> <b>cell</b> culture led us to propose that EBV replication proceeds via a relaxed circular DNA intermediate...|$|E
40|$|Defective {{deletion}} mutants can {{be replicated}} in superinfected cells by parasitism of the intact virus' replication machinery, and through replication with the host cell. We show by {{analysis of a}} mathematical model that dynamic stability of <b>superinfected</b> <b>cell</b> growth is crucial in determining the frequency of deletion mutant infected cells, i. e. there is a critical infectivity threshold rho (sc) below which the density of proliferative virus is significantly reduced {{by the presence of}} defective deletion mutants. Above rho (sc), proliferative virus principally occurs as superinfected cells (wild type with defective deletion mutant). The threshold rho (sc), and the interference effects of the deletion mutant, increase with deletion mutant parasitism of the wild-type replication machinery in superinfected cells. The interaction of virally infected cells with host homeostasis determines whether immune escape by deletion mutant infected cells is necessary for the interference window to exist. Only when the deletion mutant has a detrimental effect on infected host cell replication did we observe periodic behaviour. (C) 2000 Academic Press...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of Marek's disease virus (MDV) transcripts and protein products {{was investigated in}} reticuloendotheliosis virus-transformed avian T-lymphoblastoid cell line RECC-CU 91, which was superinfected with MDV. The presence of MDV in the <b>superinfected</b> <b>cell</b> line, renamed RECC-CU 210, was demonstrated by Southern hybridization with 32 P-labeled BamHI-H and -B fragments of the BamHI MDV DNA library. Examination of RECC-CU 210 for the {{expression of}} MDV-specific RNA transcripts encoded by the internal repeat long (IRL), internal repeat short (IRS), and unique short (US) regions of the MDV genome revealed two small transcripts of 0. 6 and 0. 7 kb. These transcripts were mapped to the IRL and IRS regions, respectively. In contrast, RECC-CU 211, which was developed through transfection of CU 210 with the BamHI-A fragment of MDV, expressed an additional nine transcripts from the IRL, IRS, and US regions. CU 211 but not CU 210 also expressed a complex of polypeptides of 40, 38, and 24 kDa, identified by monoclonal antibodies as MDV-specific phosphoproteins. The 38 -kDa phosphoprotein is likely to be pp 38, an early viral protein that maps within the IRL region of the MDV genome. These findings suggest that genes located within the transfected BamHI-A fragment transactivated a number of genes located in the IRL region of the MDV genome...|$|E
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from a nasopharyngeal {{carcinoma}} (NPC) {{hybrid cell}} line (NPC-KT) lacking defective viral DNA molecules <b>superinfected</b> Raji <b>cells</b> and induced EBV early antigens (EA), as did virus from P 3 HR- 1 cells, which contained defective molecules. The EBV polypeptides induced by NPC-KT {{appeared to be}} identical to those induced by P 3 HR- 1 virus. The ability of NPC-KT virus to induce EA was enhanced more than 10 -fold by treatment of <b>superinfected</b> <b>cells</b> with dimethyl sulfoxide; however, dimethyl sulfoxide treatment did not enhance superinfection by P 3 HR- 1 virus. After infection, DNA synthesis of both the superinfecting NPC-KT virus and the resident Raji viral genome was induced. In addition to amplified Raji EBV episomal DNA, a fused terminal fragment of NPC-KT viral DNA was detected. The detection of fused terminal DNA fragments suggests that the superinfecting virion DNA either circularizes or polymerizes after superinfection and is possibly amplified through circular or concatenated replicative intermediates...|$|R
40|$|Both avian {{myeloblastosis}} virus (by {{the action}} of v-myb) and avian myelocytomatosis virus MC 29 (by {{the action of}} v-myc) transform cells of the myelomonocytic lineage. Whereas avian myeloblastosis virus elicits a relatively immature phenotype, cells transformed by MC 29 resemble mature macrophages. When cells previously transformed by v-myb were superinfected with MC 29, their phenotype was rapidly altered {{to that of a}} more mature <b>cell.</b> These <b>superinfected</b> <b>cells</b> expressed both v-myb (at a level similar to that found before superinfection) and v-myc. It therefore appears that the expression of v-myc can elicit certain properties of a more differentiated phenotype. In addition, unlike cells transformed by v-myb alone, the cells expressing both v-myb and v-myc could not be induced by the tumor promoter 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate to differentiate to fully mature macrophages. Cells with a morphology {{similar to that of the}} <b>superinfected</b> <b>cells</b> were elicited by simultaneously infecting yolk sac macrophages with avian myeloblastosis virus and MC 29. Such cells expressed both v-myb and v-myc. These results indicate that expression of v-myb and v-myc in infected cells coordinately regulates myelomonocytic phenotype and that the two viral oncogenes vary in their ability to interfere with tumor promoter-induced differentiation. Our findings also sustain previous suggestions that the oncogenes v-myb and v-myc may not transform target cells by simply blocking differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{demonstrated}} that NK resistant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) carrying human lymphoblastoid cell lines become sensitive to NK cell-mediated destruction following induction of the viral cycle by superinfection with the P 3 HR- 1 substrain of EBV or chemicals. In the present report we analysed the cellular membrane changes that {{were related to}} the development of sensitivity to NK activity in Raji cells with metabolic inhibitors. NK sensitivity does not develop in P 3 HR- 1 <b>superinfected</b> Raji <b>cells</b> that are cultured {{in the presence of the}} RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D and drops to half the amount usually detected in <b>superinfected</b> <b>cells</b> that are grown with the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide. In experiments with cyclohexamide blocks removed after 24 h, the target cell sensitivity to NK returns to normal levels. Control Raji cells cultured with the same inhibitors for up to 72 h do not develop any sensitivity to NK cell activity. These findings suggest that the development of sensitivity to NK destruction in Raji cells following superinfection is due to the addition to the cell membrane of a virally promoted molecule(s) that requires active RNA and protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii are phylogenetically related {{intracellular}} {{bacteria that}} cause aerosol-transmitted lung infections. In host cells both pathogens proliferate in vacuoles whose biogenesis displays some common features. To test the functional similarity {{of their respective}} intracellular niches, African green monkey kidney epithelial (Vero) cells, A/J mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages, human macrophages, and human dendritic cells (DC) containing mature C. burnetii replication vacuoles were superinfected with L. pneumophila, and then the acidity, lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) content, and cohabitation of mature replication vacuoles was assessed. In all cell types, wild-type L. pneumophila occupied distinct vacuoles in close association with acidic, LAMP-positive C. burnetii replication vacuoles. In murine macrophages, but not primate macrophages, DC, or epithelial cells, L. pneumophila replication vacuoles were acidic and LAMP positive. Unlike wild-type L. pneumophila, type IV secretion-deficient dotA mutants trafficked to lysosome-like C. burnetii vacuoles in Vero cells where they survived but failed to replicate. In primate macrophages, DC, or epithelial cells, growth of L. pneumophila was as robust in <b>superinfected</b> <b>cell</b> cultures as in those singly infected. Thus, despite their noted similarities, L. pneumophila and C. burnetii are exquisitely adapted for replication in unique replication vacuoles, and factors that maintain the C. burnetii replication vacuole do not alter biogenesis of an adjacent L. pneumophila replication vacuole. Moreover, L. pneumophila can replicate efficiently in either lysosomal vacuoles of A/J mouse cells or in nonlysosomal vacuoles of primate cells...|$|E
40|$|Human {{embryonic}} lung (HEL) cells {{infected with}} human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) restricted the replication of {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 (HSV- 1). A delay in HSV replication of 15 h {{as well as a}} consistent, almost 3 log inhibition of HSV replication in HCMV-infected cell cultures harvested 24 to 72 h after superinfection were observed compared with controls infected with HSV alone. Treatment of HCMV-infected HEL cells with cycloheximide (100 micrograms/ml) for 3 or 24 h, conditions known to result in accumulation of HCMV immediate-early and early mRNA, was demonstrated effective in blocking HCMV protein synthesis, as shown by immunoprecipitation with HCMV antibody-positive polyvalent serum. Cycloheximide treatment of HCMV-infected HEL cells and removal of the cycloheximide block before superinfection inhibited HSV- 1 replication more efficiently than non-drug-treated superinfected controls. HCMV DNA-negative temperature-sensitive mutants restricted HSV as efficiently as wild-type HCMV suggesting that immediate-early and/or early events which occur before viral DNA synthesis are sufficient for inhibition of HSV. Inhibition of HSV- 1 in HCMV-infected HEL cells was unaffected by elevated temperature (40. 5 degrees C). However, prior UV irradiation of HCMV removed the block to HSV replication, demonstrating the requirement for an active HCMV genome. HSV- 2 replication was similarly inhibited in HCMV-infected HEL cells. However, replication of adenovirus, another DNA virus, was not restricted in these cells under the same conditions. Superinfection of HCMV-infected HEL cells with HSV- 1 labeled with [3 H]thymidine provided evidence that the labeled virus could penetrate to the nucleus of cells after superinfection. Evidence for penetration of superinfecting HSV into HCMV-infected cells was also provided by blot hybridization of HSV DNA synthesized in cells infected with HSV alone versus <b>superinfected</b> <b>cell</b> cultures at 0 and 48 h after superinfection. In addition, superinfection with vesicular stomatitis virus ruled out a role for interferon in restriction of HSV replication in this system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background To {{generate}} a replication-competent retrovirus {{that could be}} conditionally inactivated, we flanked the viral genes of the Akv murine leukemia virus with LoxP sites. This provirus can delete its envelope gene by LoxP/Cre mediated recombination and thereby allow superinfection of Cre recombinase expressing cells. Results In our studies, the virus repeatedly infected the cell and delivered multiple copies of the viral genome to the host genome; the <b>superinfected</b> <b>cells</b> expressed a viral transgene on average twenty times more than non-superinfected cells. The insertion of multiple LoxP sites into the cellular genome also led to genomic deletions, as demonstrated by comparative genome hybridization. Conclusion We envision that this technology may be particularly valuable for delivering transgenes and/or causing deletions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Infection of B {{lymphocytes}} by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) requires attachment {{of virus}} via binding of viral glycoprotein gp 350 to CD 21 {{on the cell}} surface. Penetration of the cell membrane additionally involves a complex of three glycoproteins, gH, gL, and gp 42. Glycoprotein gp 42 binds to HLA-DR. Interference with this interaction with a soluble form of gp 42, with a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to gp 42, or with a MAb to HLA-DR inhibited virus infection. It {{was not possible to}} <b>superinfect</b> <b>cells</b> that failed to express HLA-DR unless expression was restored by transfection or creation of hybrid cell lines with complementing deficiencies in expression of HLA class II. HLA class II molecules thus serve as cofactors for infection of human B cells...|$|R
40|$|Micrococcal {{nuclease}} digestion {{was used}} to analyze Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA structure in nuclei of transformed cells. Digests of virus-producing (P 3 HR- 1), non-virus-producing (Raji), and <b>superinfected</b> Rajii <b>cell</b> nuclei were fractionated by electrophoresis on agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized to 32 P-labeled EBV DNA. The viral DNA of Raji nuclei produced a series of bands on electrophoresis whose lengths were integral multiples of a unit size, which {{was the same as}} the repeat length of host DNA. Viral DNA in nuclei of P 3 HR- 1 and <b>superinfected</b> Raji <b>cells</b> produced faintly visible bands superimposed on a smear of viral DNA which dominated the hybridization pattern. No differences were detected in the patterns when total DNA digests from Raji, P 3 HR- 1, and an EBV DNA-negative cell line (U- 698 M) were analyzed by ethidium bromide staining or by hybridization with the use of 32 P-labeled lymphoblastoid cell DNA as probe. We conclude that the EBV episomal DNA of Raji cells is folded into nucleosomes, whereas most of the viral DNA of P 3 HR- 1 and <b>superinfected</b> Raji <b>cells</b> is not. This pattern of DNA organization differs signficantly from that in papova group viruses...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the synthesis of membrane antigen (MA) as well as virus capsid antigen (VCA) and early antigen (EA) in Daudi cells which had been superinfected with the P 3 HR-I strain of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and then treated with rypsin to remove initially absorbed MA-positive material from the cell surface. Synthesis ofMA, VCA and EA was completely inhibited by puromycin. A marked reduction {{in the frequency of}} MA positive cells was observed in <b>superinfected</b> <b>cells</b> cultured in the presence of either cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) or phosphonoacetate (PA); however, a small fraction of MA synthesis occurred, suggesting an inhibitor insensitive component in MA.

To study HTLV-I behaviour following HIV- 1 infection, we <b>superinfected</b> <b>cells</b> from two HTLV-I transformed cell lines with HIV- 1 (strain IIIB). Viral RNA analysis indicated that HTLV-I expression in the doubly infected cells was moderately enhanced. Moreover, CAT assays in HTLV-I transformed cells transiently transfected with HTLV-I LTR-CAT disclosed higher activity in the HIV- 1 superinfected cultures.

40|$|A {{technique}} of continuous filtration of T 4 -infected Escherichia coli has been devised {{to study the}} phenomenon of lysis inhibition. Studies using this technique revealed that {{the length of the}} lysis delay caused by superinfection can attain only certain discrete values, which for low average multiplicity of superinfection is thought to be a reflection of the actual number of <b>superinfecting</b> particles per <b>cell.</b> The time interval between primary and superinfection had little effect on the length of lysis delay. With increasing rate of superinfection, the length of lysis delay decreased. In <b>superinfected</b> <b>cells,</b> the concentration of endolysin exceeded the final concentration in nonsuperinfected cells. Superinfection of a lysing culture induced lysis inhibition immediately. Temperature-shift experiments, with cells primarily infected by a temperature-sensitive endolysin mutant, revealed that after the normal latent period superinfection was unable to induce lysis inhibition. Amber-restrictive cells, which were primarily infected by an endolysin negative amber mutant, released adenosine triphosphate (ATP) {{at the end of the}} normal latent period although lysis did not occur. Superinfection reduced the loss of ATP markedly. The hypothetical role of the cytoplasmic membrane in lysis inhibition is discussed...|$|R

This treatment {{was followed by}} increases {{in the percentage of}} early antigen (in both Raji and P 3 HR- 1 cells) and virus capsid antigen-positive c ils (in P 3 HR- 1 cells) and increases of approximately 20 -fold in the average number of EBV DNA equivalents in <b>superinfected</b> Raji <b>cells</b> and in TPA- and sodium n-butyrate-induced P 3 HR- 1 cells. However, the content of EBNA in these cells dropped. This was revealed by a decrease in both the complement-fixing antigen content and in the proportion of EBNA-positive cells as determined by anti-comple-ment immunofluorescence. Thus, the positive correlation found previously between the content of EBNA and the number of EBV genome quivalents per cell in proliferating lymphoblastoid cultures does not seem to apply to the situation i either <b>superinfected</b> Raji <b>cells</b> or in P 3 HR- 1 cells induced by TPA and sodium n-butyrate...|$|R

40|$|Eight {{independent}} recombinant Epstein-Barr virus genomes, each {{of which}} was a transforming strain, were made by <b>superinfecting</b> <b>cell</b> lines containing Epstein-Barr virus DNA (Raji or B 95 - 8 strain) with a nontransforming virus (P 3 HR 1 strain). A knowledge of the constitution of each transforming recombinant allowed the localization of the defect in the genome of the nontransforming parent to a 12 -megadalton sequence within the EcoRI A fragment. Within this region, the nontransforming virus has a deletion of the BamHI Y fragment and about half of the sequences in the adjacent BamHI H fragment. The present data suggest that this deletion is responsible for the nontransforming phenotype. Furthermore, mapping a deletion in one of the recombinant genomes allowed the conclusion that a sequence (comprising about 20 % of the Epstein-Barr virus genome) from the center of BamHI-D to BamHI-I' is not necessary for the maintenance of transformation by Epstein-Barr virus...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunity}} (imm) gene of the Escherichia coli bacteriophage T 4 effects {{exclusion of}} phage <b>superinfecting</b> <b>cells</b> already infected with T 4. A candidate for this gene was {{placed under the}} control of the lac regulatory elements in a pUC plasmid. DNA sequencing revealed the presence of an open reading frame encoding a very lipophilic 83 -residue (or 73 -residue, depending on the unknown site of translation initiation) polypeptide which most likely represents a plasma membrane protein. This gene could be identified as the imm gene because expression from the plasmid caused exclusion of T 4 and because interruption of the gene in the phage genome resulted in a phage no longer effecting superinfection immunity. It was found that the fraction of phage which was excluded upon infection of cells possessing the plasmid-encoded Imm protein ejected only about one-half of their DNA. Therefore, the Imm protein inhibited, directly or indirectly, DNA ejection...|$|R
40|$|Induction of {{apoptosis}} {{by different}} types of pathogenic retroviruses {{is an important step}} in disease development. We have observed that infection of thymic lymphocytes by the mink cell focus-forming murine leukemia virus (MCF MLV) during the preleukemic period resulted in an enhancement of apoptosis of these cells. To further study the ability of MCF MLVs to induce apoptosis and the role of this process in viral pathogenesis, we have developed an in vitro system of virus-induced apoptosis. MCF 13 MLV infection of mink epithelial cells resulted in the production of cytopathic foci. In contrast, infection of mink cells with the 4070 A amphotropic MLV did not produce any cytopathic effects. Staining of MCF 13 MLV-infected cells with propidium iodide and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate indicated that virus-induced cell death was due to apoptosis. At 6 days postinfection, the percentage of apoptotic MCF 13 MLV-infected cells was 27 % compared with 2 to 3 % for mock- or amphotropic MLV-infected cells, representing a 9 - to 14 -fold difference. Assays for caspase- 3 activation confirmed the detection by flow cytometry of apoptosis of MCF 13 MLV-infected cells. Large amounts of unintegrated linear viral DNA were detectable by Southern blot analysis during the acute phase of infection, which indicated that MCF 13 MLV is able to <b>superinfect</b> mink <b>cells.</b> Unintegrated viral DNA of only the linear form was detectable in thymic lymphocytes isolated from MCF 13 MLV-inoculated mice during the preleukemic period. These results indicated that the ability of MCF 13 MLV to induce apoptosis is correlated with its ability to <b>superinfect</b> <b>cells</b> and that this occurs as an early step in thymic lymphoma development...|$|R

A rabbit antiserum to immunopurified p 105 was developed. [35 S]methionine-labeled p 105 was specific to EBV-superinfected Raji cells, and its synthesis was not blocked with phosphonoacetic acid, indicating {{that it is}} an "early" viral antigen. Phosphonoacetic acid treatment of EBV-superinfected Raji cells was associated with the accumulation, mainly in the cytosol, of an 88, 000 -dalton protein, p 88, which was also recognized with anti-p 105 serum, but was not detected in <b>superinfected</b> <b>cells</b> which had not been treated with phosphonoacetic acid. Although anti-p 105 serum immunoprecipitated a membrane fraction protein, it did not neutralize P 3 HR- 1 virus and was not considered to be an exposed virion component.

The resulting recombinant viruses utilized core and envelope proteins from the wild-type virus and conferred resistance to growth in L-histidinol upon infected cells {{by virtue of the}} HisD gene encoded by the vector genome. They displayed the host range specificity of the rescuing viruses and could be neutralized by virus-specific antisera. Receptor cross-interference was observed when the GALV/SSAV or FeLV-B pseudotypes were used to <b>superinfect</b> <b>cells</b> productively infected with either GALV/SSAV or FeLV-B. Although murine cells are resistant to FeLV-B infection, murine cells expressing the human gene for the GALV/SSAV receptor became susceptible to FeLV-B infection.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) replication cycle on natural killing (NK) activity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against EBV-infected cells. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy EBV-seropositive and -seronegative donors were separated on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients and used as effector cells in the standard 51 Cr release assay to measure NK and ADCC. EBV-genome positive RAJI and DAUDI <b>cells</b> <b>superinfected</b> with either the non-transforming P 3 HR- 1 EBV or the transforming B 95 - 8 EBV were used as targets. The results obtained show that most normal individuals have ADCC and NK activity against P 3 HR- 1 EBV-infected RAJI cells. Both the cytotoxic activities increased with the proportional increase in effector/target (E/T) ratios, assay incubation time, dose of the infecting virus and the time of pre-infection with EBV. Moreover, the data obtained indicate that different immune mechanisms are effective at different stages of the virus replication cycle. During the early stages of virus replication, EBV-superinfected cells are more susceptible to ADCC than to NK, whereas in later stages the susceptibility to NK is increased significantly and appears to play a more dominant role. The nature of the target cells or the strain of EBV used to superinfect these targets did not influence their susceptibility to ADCC and NK activity; however some quantitative differences were found. Using metabolic inhibitors such as cytosine arabinoside, phosphonoacetic acid, actinomycin D, cycloheximide and puromycin, it was found that new DNA synthesis is not essential but some RNA and protein synthesis is necessary, late in the viral cycle, for the <b>superinfected</b> <b>cells</b> to become susceptible to NK and ADCC...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunity}} protein (Imm) encoded by the Escherichia coli phage T 4 effects {{exclusion of}} phage <b>superinfecting</b> <b>cells</b> already infected with T 4. The 83 -residue polypeptide possesses two long lipophilic areas (from residues 3 to 32 and 37 to 65) {{interrupted by a}} hydrophilic stretch including two positively charged residues.

While it could be shown that the expected location was correct, fusions of Imm to alkaline phosphatase or beta-galactosidase showed that the C terminus was at the cytosolic side of the membrane. Also, concerning function, there was almost no structural specificity to this part of the protein. Even removal of the two positively charged residues did not completely abolish function. Evidence suggesting that Imm is associated with the membrane at specific sites is presented. It is proposed that Imm is localized to the membrane {{with the help of a}} receptor and that, therefore, it does not follow the established rules for the topology of other membrane proteins.

40|$|The genetic {{basis of}} {{superinfection}} exclusion by bacteriophage T 4 was investigated by using incomplete genomes {{derived from the}} gene 66 mutant E 920 g. Incomplete genomes, which included a region of T 4 between genes 42 and 44, were able to exclude superinfecting phage with an efficiency {{similar to that of}} complete genomes. Those genomes which did not include this region were unable to exclude superinfecting phage. A mutant with reduced ability to exclude super-infecting phage was isolated after mutagenesis with hydroxylamine. The mutation maps midway between amN 122 in gene 42 and amB 22 in gene 43. The efficiency of exclusion of superinfecting phage (as measured by the percentage of <b>superinfected</b> <b>cells</b> which failed to release any phage carrying selected markers of the superinfecting phage) by this mutant was 50 to 60 %, whereas for wild type it was 85 to 95 %. Uptake of 3 H-leucine by cells infected with the mutant was inhibited by superinfection with ghosts and it has therefore been designated imm 1, for lack of immunity to superinfecting phage and ghosts.

The RNA synthesized in vitro was used to program rabbit reticulocyte lysates, which were analyzed for the synthesis of the putative polymerase polypeptide (110 kDa) and assayed directly for EBV DNA polymerase activity. The polypeptide synthesized by the full-length BALF 5 genomic fragment had a molecular mass of 110 kDa. 5 '-truncated BALF 5 with the first and second ATGs deleted produced 95 - and 83 -kDa polypeptides, respectively. All three translation products were enzymatically active and displayed resistance to high salt concentrations. The identity of the largest polypeptide as the viral polymerase was established by (i) immunoprecipitation with EBV-positive sera from patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and by a rabbit polyclonal antiserum prepared with a synthetic peptide derived from the DNA sequence of BALF 5; (ii) identification of a polypeptide of identical size (110 kDa) immunoprecipitated from <b>superinfected</b> Raji <b>cell</b> extracts by these antibodies; and (iii) salt-resistant enzymatic activity which was neutralized by the rabbit EBV antiserum.

One of these cell lines, Clone 4, produced high levels of replication-competent virus and contained two proviruses. Southern blot analysis of DNAs from Clone 4 revealed that, after extended culture, some of the cells had acquired additional proviruses, presumably by superinfection. Analysis of Clone 4 single-cell subclones isolated from a late-passage culture found that 14 out of 20 (70 %) subclones were reinfected and that 8 out of 20 (40 %) were reinfected more than once. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed that surface CD 4 levels on Clone 4 cells were appropriately down-regulated. Our results indicate that while there is significant interference to superinfection in the Clone 4 culture, it is not absolute and that <b>superinfected</b> <b>cells</b> accumulate in the culture over time {{in the presence of}} high virus exposure and extensive cell-to-cell contact.

40|$|We {{report the}} use of {{monoclonal}} antibody against the early antigen diffuse component (anti-EA-D) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to analyze, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the expression of EA-D in various human lymphoblastoid cell lines activated by chemical inducers. The kinetics of synthesis of EA-D in P 3 HR- 1, B 95 - 8, and Ramos/AW cells were similar in that they all reached the peak of synthesis on day 5 after induction. Surprisingly, no expression of EA-D was found in induced BJAB/GC, an EBV-genome-containing cell line. EBV-negative cell lines, BJAB and Ramos, were negative for EA-D. Raji cells had no detectable EA-D but responded rapidly to induction, reaching a peak on day 3. Superinfection of Raji cells also resulted in marked induction of EA-D, which reached a plateau between 8 to 12 h postinfection. Western blotting coupled with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed to identify polypeptides representing EA-D. A family of four polypeptides with molecular weights of 46, 000 (46 K protein), 49, 000, 52, 000, and 55, 000 were identified to be reactive with monoclonal anti-EA-D antiserum. The pattern of EA-D polypeptides expressed in each cell line was different. Of particular interest was {{the expression of a}} large quantity of 46 K protein both in induced Raji and P 3 HR- 1 cells, but not in <b>superinfected</b> Raji <b>cells.</b> A 49 K doublet was expressed in activated p 3 HR- 1, B 95 - 8, and Ramos/AW <b>cells</b> and in <b>superinfected</b> Raji <b>cells.</b> In addition, two distinct 52 K and 55 K polypeptides were expressed in induced Ramos/AW and <b>superinfected</b> Raji <b>cells.</b> However, none of these EA-D polypeptides was detectable in BJAB/GC, BJAB, Ramos, and mock-infected Raji cells. To approximate relative concentrations of EA-D in cell extracts, we employed the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot dot methods by using one of the purified EA-D components to construct a standard curve. Depending upon the cell lines, it was estimated that ca. 1 to 3 % (determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and 0. 8 to 1. 6 % (determined by immunoblot dot) of total proteins from maximally induced cells were EA-D. These results suggest that differential expression of EA-D polypeptides could be of importance in the diagnosis of state of EBV infection...|$|R
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus {{obtained}} by superinfection of Raji cells with Epstein-Barr virus recovered from P 3 HR 1 cells (HRI virus) transformed human lymphocytes, {{but it did}} not <b>superinfect</b> Raji <b>cells.</b> A human lymphoblastoid cell line, HLB, established by such transformation contained 22 Epstein-Barr virus genomes per cell and Epstein-Barr virus-associated nuclear antigen, and a few cells contained early or viral capsid antigen complexes. Chromosomal analysis revealed that HLB-cells were diploid with normal female karyotypes. Replication of Epstein-Barr virus DNA and inhibition of host cell DNA synthesis were observed in HLB cells after superinfection with HR 1 virus...|$|R
40|$|The {{roles of}} topoisomerases I and II in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{replication}} were investigated using Raji cells infected with EBV. The topoisomerase II inhibitor ellipticine inhibited {{the synthesis of}} EBV polypeptides at concentrations which did not affect total protein synthesis. Slot blot analysis of total cellular DNA showed that camptothecin and ellipticine inhibited replication of progeny EBV DNA in <b>superinfected</b> Raji <b>cells</b> at concentrations which did not inhibit synthesis of EBV early polypeptides prerequisite for EBV DNA replication. Analysis {{of the structure of}} EBV DNA termini demonstrated that both inhibitors affected the replicating EBV DNA. Gardella gel electrophoresis showed that both inhibitors affected the formation of the linear form of EBV DNA. However, restriction analysis of EBV DNA in <b>superinfected</b> Raji <b>cells</b> demonstrated that both inhibitors degraded neither endogenous nor exogenous EBV DNA. Cell viability was not affected by either inhibitor at the concentrations tested. These findings suggest hat topoisomerase II is required for expression of the EBV genome and that both topoiso-merases I and II are involved in replication of the EBV genome during the lytic phase of the life cycle. The effects of topoisomerase inhibitors on the circular form of EBV DNA during virus replication are discussed. Topoisomerases I and II are involved in gene expression and replication of eukaryotes (Maxwell & Gellert, 1985; Wang, 1985). In the case of animal viruses, topoiso-merases play important roles in viral DNA replication, transcription, packaging and integration (Foglesong &...|$|R
40|$|The γ 134. 5 protein of {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) is {{required}} for viral neurovirulence in vivo. In infected cells, this viral protein prevents the shutoff of protein synthesis mediated by double-stranded-RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR. This is accomplished by recruiting protein phosphatase 1 to dephosphorylate the α subunit of translation initiation factor eIF- 2 (eIF- 2 α). Moreover, the γ 134. 5 protein is implicated in viral egress and interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen. In this report, we show that the γ 134. 5 protein encoded by HSV- 1 (F) is distributed in the nucleus, nucleolus, and cytoplasm in transfected or <b>superinfected</b> <b>cells.</b> Deletion analysis revealed that the Arg-rich cluster from amino acids 1 to 16 in the γ 134. 5 protein functions as a nucleolar localization signal. The region from amino acids 208 to 236, containing a bipartite basic amino acid cluster, is able to mediate nuclear localization. R 215 A and R 216 A substitutions in the bipartite motif disrupt this activity. Intriguingly, leptomycin B, an inhibitor of nuclear export, blocks the cytoplasmic accumulation of the γ 134. 5 protein. L 134 A and L 136 A substitutions in the leucine-rich motif completely excluded the γ 134. 5 protein from the cytoplasm. These {{results suggest that the}} γ 134. 5 protein continuously shuttles between the nucleus, nucleolus, and cytoplasm, which may be a requirement for the different activities of the γ 134. 5 protein in virus-infected cells...|$|R

40|$|Cells of Escherichia coli B {{infected}} with the immunity-negative (imm 2) mutant of bacteriophage T 4 are able to develop a substantial level of immunity to superinfecting phage ghosts if the ghost challenge is made late in infection. This background immunity is not seen in infections with phage carrying the spackle (s) mutation {{in addition to the}} imm 2 lesion. The level of immunity in s− infections is intermediate between that of imm− and wild-type infections under standard assay conditions. With respect to genetic exclusion of <b>superinfecting</b> phage, <b>cells</b> {{infected with}} imm− phage are completely deficient, whereas infections with the s− phage are only partially deficient compared to wild-type infections. Whereas s−-infected cells are unable to resist lysis from without by a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of <b>superinfecting</b> phage, <b>cells</b> infected with imm− phage show less than wild-type levels of resistance and the majority of cells remaining intact are unable to incorporate leucine or form infective centers. Under conditions of superinfection by low MOI of homologous phage, imm−-infected cells are lysis inhibited, whereas s−-infected cells do not show this property. Superinfecting phage inject their DNA into imm−-infected cells with the same efficiency as seen in wild-type infections, but this efficiency is reduced when the cells are first infected with s− phage. The s function of T 4 appears not only to affect the host cell wall as previously postulated by Emrich, but may also affect the junctures of cell wall and membrane with consequences {{similar to those of the}} imm function...|$|R
40|$|The {{selective}} and potent anti-herpesvirus drug, (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxyuridine (BVdU), {{has been}} examined for its inhibitory effects on several parameters of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{infection in the}} lymphoblastoid cell lines Raji, P 3 HR- 1, B- 95 - 8 and P 3 hybrid cells (a human embryo oropharyngeal cell line fused with a nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line). At a dosage of 0. 03 to 0. 1 mM, BVdU caused a marked inhibition of (i) spontaneous viral capsid antigen (VCA) expression in B- 95 - 8 and P 3 hybrid cells, (ii) VCA expression and DNA synthesis in B- 95 - 8 cells induced with croton oil and n-butyrate, (iii) early antigen (EA) expression and DNA synthesis in Raji <b>cells</b> <b>superinfected</b> with EBV, and (iv) VCA expression and DNA synthesis in B- 95 - 8 <b>cells</b> <b>superinfected</b> with EBV. In its inhibitory effects on these various parameters of EBV infection, BVdU appears to be comparable to acyclovir [9 -(2 -hydroxyethoxymethyl) guanine], another selective anti-herpesvirus drug which has been previously recognized as an effective inhibitor of EBV replication. status: publishe...|$|R
