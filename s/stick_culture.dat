50|$|Some {{might be}} able to adjust to the various {{cultures}} in the world by committing to two or more cultures. It is not required to <b>stick</b> to one <b>culture.</b> Many people socialize and interact with people in one culture in addition to another group of people in another culture. Thus cultural identity is able to take many forms and can change depending on the cultural area. This plasticity is what allows people to feel like part of society wherever they go.|$|R
40|$|In this article, Lowell D. Holmes’ criticizes {{cultural}} relativism in anthropology. He {{believes that}} “anthropologists must establish a standard {{upon which to}} base criticism of those forms of human behavior which threaten man as a species or do him violence either physically or mentally. Anthropology continues to like all cultures and all practices there in either because they were created by the "noble savage" or merely because they exist. Valuing all cultures equally is as unrealistic as other forms of stereotyping. Unless we have the courage and ingenuity to develop a yard <b>stick</b> for evaluating <b>cultures</b> we cannot judge the adequacy of any given culture {{to meet the needs}} and aspirations of its participants. Some cultures work better than others in sustaining human life. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze TV and viral {{advertisements}} in India for their reflection of traditional and contemporary cultures. In order to reach this purpose, an exhaustive list of literature on culture and cultural values in advertisements are consulted. Using guidelines from previous research and literatures on content analysis, advertising appeals and netnography, qualitative analyses {{of the contents of}} four animated advertising videos from India and consumer comments on the same are conducted. Based on the researcher’s observations and interpretations, the study reveals that advertisements in both media reflect cultural values, but in surprisingly different ways. TV advertisements reflect new and modern values in India, whereas the supposedly radical viral advertisements tend to <b>stick</b> to traditional <b>culture...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractRoutine cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) medical care includes invasive procedures {{that may be}} difficult for young children and adolescents to tolerate because of anxiety, concern with health status, or unfamiliarity with the performed tasks. A growing body of pediatric psychology literature suggests that behavior therapy can effectively increase patient cooperation with stressful medical procedures such as tracheostomy care and needle <b>sticks.</b> Throat <b>cultures</b> are obtained at least quarterly in the outpatient setting or more frequently if a CF patient develops respiratory symptoms. Obtaining a throat culture from an anxious and uncooperative child poses a significant challenge for physicians, since the child may demonstrate emotional distress and avoidant behavior that disrupts efficient specimen collection during a routine clinic visit. The use of behavioral interventions, such as relaxation exercises, diaphragmatic breathing, differential reinforcement, gradual exposure, and systematic desensitization, is beneficial in addressing this commonly encountered problem in CF care. This case series describes the implementation of a behavioral therapy protocol utilizing two interventions, gradual exposure and systematic desensitization, in two young CF patients for the treatment of behavioral distress with routine throat cultures. The behavioral interventions were simple and transferred easily from mock procedures to actual specimen collection. Moreover, these cases highlight the important roles of the pediatric psychology staff on a comprehensive multidisciplinary CF care team to improve patient cooperation with routine clinic procedures and the medical treatment regimen overall...|$|R
40|$|Background: Urinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) {{remains one}} of the main complications after kidney transplantation and it has serious consequences. Methods: Fifty-two patients with kidney transplantation were evaluated for UTI at 3 - 145 days (mean 40. 0 days) after surgery [...] Forty-two received a graft from a live donor and 10 from a deceased donor. There were 22 female and 30 male patients, aged 11 - 47 years. Microscopic examinations, leukocyte esterase <b>stick,</b> and urinary <b>culture</b> were performed every third day and weekly after hospitalization. A positive culture was consider when patients presented bacterial counts up to 10 5 counts. Results: UTI developed in 19 / 52 (37 %) patients at 3 - 75 days (mean 19. 5 days after transplantation. Recurrent infection was observed in 7 / 52 (13. 4 %) patients at days 17 - 65. UTI was more frequent in patients who received deceased grafts compared with live grafts (7 / 10, 70 % vs. 12 / 42, 28 %; p < 0. 007). Female patients were more susceptible than male (11 / 22, 50 % vs. 8 / 22, 36. 35 %; p < 0. 042). Five-year survival rate was 94. 5 % (49 / 52 patients). Kidney Graft exit update is 47 / 52 (90. 2 %), and {{there were no significant differences}} between graft rejection and UTI (p = 0. 2518). Isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (31. 5 %), Candida albicans (21. 0 %) and Enterococcus spp. (10. 5 %), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae an...|$|R

Enterococcus spp. (57 %), E. coli (28 %) and Micrococcus spp. (14. 2 %). Antibiotic resistance was 22 % for ciprofloxacin and 33 % for ampicillin. Therapeutic alternatives were aztreonam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, netilmicin and fosfomycin. Conclusions Surveillance of UTI for the first 3 months is a good option for improving quality of life of kidney transplantation patients and the exit of graft function especially for female patients and those receiving deceased grafts. Antibiograms provided a good therapeutic alternative to patients who presented with UTIs after receiving a kidney allograft. </p...|$|R
40|$|B. thuringiensis {{can produce}} a {{floating}} biofilm which includes two parts: a ring and a pellicle. The ring is a thick structure which <b>sticks</b> to the <b>culture</b> container, while the pellicle extends over the whole liquid surface and joins the ring. We have followed over time, from 16 h to 96 h, sporulation in the two biofilm parts. Sporulation was followed in situ in 48 -wells polystyrene microtiterplates with a fluorescence binocular stereomicroscope and a spoIID-yfp transcriptional fusion. Sporulation took place much earlier in the ring than in the pellicle. In 20 h-aged biofilms, spoIID was expressed only in the ring, which {{could be seen as}} a green fluorescent circle surrounding the non-fluorescent pellicle. However, after 48 h of culture, the pellicle started to express spoIID in specific area corresponding to protrusions, and after 96 h both the ring and the whole pellicle expressed spoIID. Spore counts and microscopy observations of the ring and the pellicle harvested separately confirmed these results and revealed that sporulation occured 24 h-later in the pellicle comparatively to the ring, although both structures contained nearly 100 % spores after 96 h of culture. We hypothesize that two mechanisms, due to microenvironments in the biofilm, can explain this difference. First, the ring experiences a decreased concentration of nutrients earlier than the pellicle, because of a lower exchange area with the culture medium. An second, the ring is exposed to partial dryness. Both reasons could speed up sporulation in this biofilm structure. Our results also suggest that spores in the biofilm display a phenotypic heterogeneity. These observations might be of particular significance for the food industry, since the biofilm part sticking to container walls - the ring - is likely to contain spores and will therefore resist both to washing and to cleaning procedures, and will be able to restart a new biofilm when food production has resumed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken {{to explore the}} relationship between consumers' socioeconomic status and their preferences in the cultural sector, with a particular focus on classical cultural events. The objectives of the research were to understand what extent a consumer is influenced by their social class and, therefore, how this motivates their tastes in culture. The research aimed to identify {{if there were any}} social barriers that stopped people attending certain types of events and if there was a way to lower these barriers. The research is important as it will help identify the areas of the cultural sector that are not accessible to all and question why this is the case, therefore, helping tackle social exclusion in culture. A literature review was conducted as a way to develop the theoretical frameworks of the investigation. The main theories and theme discussed by the literature was how if a consumer belonged to a certain socio-economic group, that social group had a particular set of cultural preferences. This was the idea supported by Gans (1974; 1999) and Bourdieu (1984; 1992) which highlighted the elitist nature of the cultural industry. This, therefore, allowed for the study to build a framework to conduct the research to meet the aims and objectives. A mixed methods approach of both quantitative and qualitative data was adopted; this was a way of ensuring that both the audiences and the venues had a chance to answer questions about the topic. The study focused on Edinburgh. Selfcompletion questionnaires were issued over social media for the consumers and semistructured interviews were conducted with marketing managers at three different venues. The main findings of the research were that consumers had habits of <b>sticking</b> with the <b>culture</b> that was perceived to be for their socio-economic group. Pricing of an event, regardless of the culture, was identified as a barrier for attendance and therefore, was identified as a factor of social exclusion. However, it was noted that not everyone sticks with the stereotype for their group, as there can be exceptions based on factors such as age and circumstance. The venues do not believe that they contribute to social exclusion; however, it was noted that there is a clear difference between funded and non-funded venues and the way the market to all audience types...|$|R
40|$|Lower {{urinary tract}} {{symptoms}} (LUTS) {{are caused by}} a variety of different diseases, including cancer in the urinary tract, overactive bladder (OB) and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). In order to find the most plausible cause of the patientís LUTS, a number of different investigations have been developed. The standard investigations recommended by the WHO for a patient with LUTS include routine lab. tests like s-PSA, urinary <b>sticks</b> and urine <b>culture,</b> symptom score, a voiding diary, digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound, office uroflowmetry and measurement of residual urine. However, BOO can only be accurately diagnosed by the urodynamic assessment of pressure and flow studies (pQS). OB is revealed by cystometry. The first aim {{of the present study was}} to determine if home uroflowmetry can give more information than ìtraditionalî office uroflowmetry, and whether home uroflowmetry can reflect the results of pQS. BOO commonly coexists with OB in patients with LUTS. The second aim was to describe and quantify this phenomenon by a standardised investigation including cystometry and pQS and to elucidate differences between patients with ìpureî BOO and patients with BOO combined with OB. The natural history of BOO due to BPE is poorly understood. The aim of the third study was to investigate a group of patients who themselves preferred WW and to follow the development of symptoms and the frequency of failure and complications during four years. pQS has been proposed as a useful instrument for selection of graded treatment of BOO. We have also used pQS for selected treatment in three arms: TURP, TUMT and WW, and then studied the results after 1 year. In this study, the patients were treated as minimally invasively as possible. In the fifth study, we have used biodegradable PGA stents to judge the risk of post-TURP incontinence in patients with a combination of BOO and OB. With home uroflowmetry, it is possible in 50 % of cases to reveal if the patient has a minor or severe BOO. pQS seems useful for selection to different treatments according to their BOO. The prevalence of OB increases with increasing BOO, suggesting that BOO can be a cause of OB. We observed that the failure rate in WW increased with increasing obstruction, but the complication rate of WW was minor. BOO combined with OB is present in 45 % of the patients. In 30 % of the patients there is a risk of post-TURP urgency incontinence. A PGA-stent seems very useful to judge the risk of post-TURP incontinence in patients with a combination of BOO and severe OB. None of the patients who remained continent during the stent period became incontinent after TUR...|$|R
