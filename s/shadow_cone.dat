25|$|In {{the second}} book, Hipparchus starts from the {{opposite}} extreme assumption: he assigns a (minimum) distance to the Sun of 490 Earth radii. This would correspond to a parallax of 7', which is apparently the greatest parallax that Hipparchus thought would not be noticed (for comparison: the typical resolution of the human eye is about 2'; Tycho Brahe made naked eye observation with an accuracy down to 1'). In this case, {{the shadow of the}} Earth is a cone rather than a cylinder as under the first assumption. Hipparchus observed (at lunar eclipses) that at the mean distance of the Moon, the diameter of the <b>shadow</b> <b>cone</b> is 2+½ lunar diameters. That apparent diameter is, as he had observed, 360/650 degrees. With these values and simple geometry, Hipparchus could determine the mean distance; because it was computed for a minimum distance of the Sun, it is the maximum mean distance possible for the Moon. With his value for the eccentricity of the orbit, he could compute the least and greatest distances of the Moon too. According to Pappus, he found a least distance of 62, a mean of 67+1/3, and consequently a greatest distance of 72+2/3 Earth radii. With this method, as the parallax of the Sun decreases (i.e., its distance increases), the minimum limit for the mean distance is 59 Earth radii – exactly the mean distance that Ptolemy later derived.|$|E

40|$|The shadowing/blocking {{characteristics}} of medium energy ion scattering allow a precise deduction of the layer-by-layer composition of alloy crystal surfaces. The technique relies on an accurate {{alignment of the}} ion beam with known crystallographic directions to restrict the incoming beam to illuminate just the topmost one, {{two or three or}} more layers. Further layer specificity is bestowed by utilising outgoing geometries that block ions from all but the top one, two, etc., layers respectively. The size of <b>shadow</b> <b>cones</b> associated with medium energy hydrogen and helium ions is ideal for this application. A plot of the averaged experimental yields against simulated yields for several different systems implies an inconsistency in the technique.

40|$|Abstract — A points surface {{reconstruction}} algorithm of 3 D object {{models from}} multiple silhouettes is proposed in this paper. Some {{images of the}} target object are taken from a circular trajectory by a robot with a camera mounted in an eye-in-hand configuration. The silhouettes of the observed object are evaluated for each view using a blob analysis process, and from those a set of points that sample a reconstruction sphere surrounding the target object are estimated. The sphere sample points are attracted by the object center of mass using a variable step according to {{the distance from the}} silhouettes contours. For each point, the iterative process of constriction is stopped when all the back-projections of the point are within the corresponding silhouettes. Moreover, a new method based on a rough estimation of object dimension is proposed to reduce the disturbances due to projection and <b>shadow</b> <b>cones.</b> Simulations and experiments are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

5000|$|Impact-collision ion {{scattering}} spectroscopy (ICISS) {{takes advantage}} of shadowing and blocking {{in order to make}} precise determinations about interatomic spacing of the first 1-2 layers in a surface. The specific scattering geometry (180 degrees) ensures detection of only those particles which have undergone head-on collisions with surface atoms (thereby avoiding the complications of multiple scattering events). Starting sampling at a relatively high angle of incidence and scanning over varying incidence angles, the intensity of one particular energy peak is monitored. Scattered ions form shadow cones (see above) behind each atom, which prevents any backscattering at low incidence angles. A peak in scattering intensity is observed when the cones line up such that each passes over the adjacent atom. Performing such an analysis on a sample with known interatomic spacing enables determination of the shape of the <b>shadow</b> <b>cone,</b> where as shown at right, [...] and [...] If the shape of the <b>shadow</b> <b>cone</b> is known, the interatomic spacing between surface atoms as well as the spacing and directionality between surface and subsurface atoms can then be calculated from the resulting peak-and-valley structure in a graph of intensity versus scattering angle. In the graph at right showing scattering intensity from a subsurface (second layer) atom, [...] corresponds {{to the middle of the}} [...] "valley" [...] where the atom is being blocked by a surface atom.

40|$|Starting from Michel Foucault’s {{reflections}} on the relationship among space, power and city, this paper explores the urban space as a biopolitical organization. The city is considered {{as a form of}} dislocation of space-power, a concept introduced by Foucault to analyze how urban space is thought and designed by the contemporary governmental rationality. These models of production of the urban space constitute some of the elements of the biopolitics of space, in which disciplinary and securitarian concerns arise, both in terms of order and management of life. If, as Foucault has effectively shown, the concept of biopolitics of the population is a spatial one, its dislocation in the city may tell its plot, seeking the possible meanings it offers rather than the urban landscape. Its aim is to trace some of the possible points of an urban cartography of the contemporary governmental rationality which find some examples in the centre-suburb as a modality of symbolic organization of social inequality, the public space as a space of symbolic subtraction of the idea of citizenship, the <b>shadow</b> <b>cones</b> as “spaces of exception”, areas for the symbolic reproduction of power into space...|$|R

US has changed from having a purely diagnostic role to become an important therapeutic tool, especially for carrying out bursal lavage and tendon needling (Fig. 1 b, c). Use of high-resolution US shows the presence of deposits and also defines their locations in the tendon, plus their size and texture. This technique shows RC tears in detail, and also enables staging of the deposits by correlation of <b>shadow</b> <b>cones</b> [30, 31]. In the resting phase, the deposits appear hyperechoic and arc shaped, whereas they appear non-arc shaped (fragmented/punctate, cystic, nodular) in the resolving phase [30]. These appearances can also be correlated with the symptomatic and asymptomatic phases of the disease [32]. Farin et al. [33] divided the deposits into three types: (1) hyperechoic focus with a well-defined shadow, (2) hyperechoic focus with a faint shadow and (3) hyperechoic focus with no shadow. Doppler examination during the nodular or cystic phase shows increased vascularity around the deposits [34], which correlates well with the histopathological findings of Uhthoff et al. [35], who showed how, during the reabsorption phase, the deposits are surrounded by phagocytes and there was concomitant proliferation of vascular channels around the deposits.|$|R

40|$|In 1819, Johann Purkinje {{described}} how a moving light source that displaces {{the shadow of}} the retinal blood vessels to adjacent cones can produce the entopic percept of a branching tree. Here, we describe a novel method for producing a similar percept. We used a device that mixes 56 narrowband primaries under computer control, in conjunction with the method of silent substitution, to present observers with a spectral modulation that selectively targeted penumbral <b>cones</b> in the <b>shadow</b> of the retinal blood vessels. Such a modulation elicits a clear Purkinje-tree percept. We show that the percept is specific to penumbral L and M cone stimulation and is not produced by selective penumbral S cone stimulation. The Purkinje-tree percept was strongest at 16 Hz and fell off at lower (8 Hz) and higher (32 Hz) temporal frequencies. Selective stimulation of open-field cones that are not in <b>shadow,</b> with penumbral <b>cones</b> silenced, also produced the percept, but it was not seen when penumbral and open-field cones were modulated together. This indicates the need for spatial contrast between penumbral and open-field cones to create the Purkinje-tree percept. Our observation provides a new means for studying the response of retinally stabilized images and demonstrates that penumbral cones can support spatial vision. Further, the result illustrates a way in which silent substitution techniques can fail to be silent. We show that inadvertent penumbral cone stimulation can accompany melanopsin-directed modulations that are designed only to silence open-field cones. This in turn can result in visual responses that might be mistaken as melanopsin-driven...|$|R

Also, multiple scattering events are very likely which complicates analysis. Importantly, due to the lower energy ions used LEIS is typically characterized by large interaction cross-sections and <b>shadow</b> <b>cone</b> radii. For this reason penetration depth is low and the method has much higher first-layer sensitivity than MEIS or RBS.

Because of cancelling errors in his parallax figure, his theory of the Moon's orbit, and other factors, this figure was approximately correct. He then measured the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon and concluded that the apparent diameter of the Sun was equal to the apparent diameter of the Moon at the Moon's greatest distance, and from records of lunar eclipses, he estimated this apparent diameter, as well as the apparent diameter of the <b>shadow</b> <b>cone</b> of Earth traversed by the Moon during a lunar eclipse.
