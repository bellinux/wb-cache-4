In June 1942, he became the RAF's youngest wing commander in its history. Finucane was appointed to lead the Hornchurch Wing.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Britain Lock {{served on}} the Channel Front, flying {{offensive}} sweeps over France. Lock went on to bring his overall total to 26 aerial victories, one <b>shared</b> <b>destroyed</b> and eight probable in 25 weeks of operational sorties over a one-year period—during which time he was hospitalised for six months.

5|$|During {{the year}} 1943, U-boat losses {{amounted}} to 258 to all causes. Of this total, 90 were sunk by Coastal Command, and 51 damaged. Up until that time, in May 1943, Coastal Command had sighted submarines on 825 occasions, {{which resulted in}} 607 attacks. Only 27 were sunk, and three were <b>shared</b> <b>destroyed.</b> Another 120 were damaged. Against those figures, 233 aircraft, 116 of which were lost owing to weather conditions, were destroyed. Of this figure, 179 were from No. 19 Group RAF, attacking U-boats over the Bay of Biscay.|$|E
5000|$|His wartime {{tally of}} 20 {{victories}} consisted of 1 (and 1 <b>shared)</b> balloons <b>destroyed,</b> 7 ( [...] and 4 <b>shared)</b> aircraft <b>destroyed,</b> and 6 (and 1 shared) 'out of control'.|$|R
50|$|Beauchamp-Proctor's victory total was 54; two (and one shared) {{captured}} enemy aircraft, 13 (and three <b>shared)</b> balloons <b>destroyed,</b> 15 (and one <b>shared)</b> aircraft <b>destroyed,</b> and 15 (and one shared) aircraft 'out of control'.

5|$|Finucane was {{credited}} with 28 aerial victories, five probably destroyed, six <b>shared</b> <b>destroyed,</b> one shared probable victory, and eight damaged. Included in his total were 23 Messerschmitt Bf 109s, four Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and one Messerschmitt Bf 110. Official records differ over the exact total. After the war, two of Finucane's victories that were credited as probables had, in fact, been destroyed, but were not officially included. His total victory count {{could be as high}} as 32. Some sources credit him this figure.|$|E
5|$|Historian Alfred Price {{credited}} McKellar with 17 air victories, three <b>shared</b> <b>destroyed,</b> five {{probably destroyed}} and three damaged. Historians Christopher Shores and Clive Williams credit him with 21 air victories, three probably destroyed and three damaged as does E.C.R Baker. In his last combat they credit {{him with a}} possible 22nd victory, since a Bf 109 crashed {{in the area of}} his last combat and no RAF pilot made a claim. John Foreman credits him with at least 17 victories and acknowledges the unclaimed Bf 109 that crashed on 1 November 1940 near to McKellar might have been his last victory. Chaz Bowyer, another prolific historian and writer on RAF personnel credits McKellar with at least 20 victories.|$|E
5|$|In May 1940 his {{squadron}} {{took part}} in the Battle of France, during which Dundas claimed his first two victories.

At the time of his last battle Dundas had been credited with 12 aircraft destroyed, two <b>shared</b> <b>destroyed,</b> four probably destroyed and five damaged. During a battle over the English Channel on 28 November 1940, Dundas is believed to have engaged and shot down Helmut Wick, the highest scoring ace of the Luftwaffe at that time. Moments later Dundas was also shot down into the sea. Both pilots vanished and remain missing in action.|$|E

500|$|McCudden's {{remains were}} {{subsequently}} buried {{at the nearby}} Wavans war cemetery in the Pas de Calais. McCudden's death occurred only {{two months after the}} death of German ace Manfred von Richthofen, whom some commented had been honoured with a longer and more elaborate funeral by the British. McCudden's wartime score was 57 victories included 19 captured, 27 and 1 <b>shared</b> <b>destroyed,</b> 8 and 2 shared [...] "down out of control"—an official classification which still counted the claim as a victory.|$|E
500|$|The loss of Hull and Reynell, {{two of the}} squadron's {{most popular}} pilots, {{affected}} morale deeply. Kilmartin, arriving back at Tangmere {{on the evening of}} 7 September, simply muttered [...] "My God, My God". Dalton-Morgan took over command of the squadron.

500|$|A year later, {{he gained}} fame in 1940 during the Battle of Britain {{as a part}} of, and later {{squadron}} leader of, No. 605 Squadron RAF, equipped with the Hawker Hurricane fighter. The Auxiliary Unit was moved to southern England and participated in the large air battles. McKellar's combat career proved to be very brief, lasting just over a year. He claimed {{all but two of}} his victories within the last {{two and a half months}} of his life; 15 August–1 November 1940. On 7 October 1940 he shot down five Messerschmitt Bf 109s, thus becoming an ace in a day; one of only 24 Allied aces to achieve the feat. At the time of his last mission he had claimed 21 aerial victories and another two <b>shared</b> <b>destroyed</b> against enemy aircraft. Included in this total of 21 air victories are 11 Bf 109s. McKellar, along with Ronald Hamlyn and Brian Carbury, were the only British pilots to achieve the feat of [...] "Ace in a Day" [...] during the Battle of Britain.|$|E
500|$|By early 1941, the Luftwaffe rarely {{appeared}} in daylight and Finucane {{spent most of}} his operational time patrolling the Channel coast.

Off St. Catherine's Point on 19 January, Finucane was one of two Spitfires that intercepted a Junkers Ju 88 at [...] They chased the Ju 88 to within [...] of Cherbourg and broke off for lack of fuel. They left the Ju 88 on fire in both engines and flying at 50 feet. The pilot had proven a skilful opponent. The Ju 88 flew low-level skidding turns and into the sun where the glare prevented the British pilots from gaining a clear view. The rear gunner was also firing accurately, hitting Finucane's fighter with a few well placed rounds. The Ju 88 was credited as <b>shared</b> <b>destroyed.</b> The share was with Sergeant H. Orchard.|$|E
