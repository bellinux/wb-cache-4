40|$|Previous {{research}} has drawn attention {{to differences in}} shopping styles between females and males. This paper reports {{the development of a}} psychometrically reliable quantitative <b>scale</b> to measure <b>shopping</b> style, such that female shoppers tend to score relatively high and males relatively low. At the same time, as a companion to the <b>shopping</b> style <b>scale,</b> the authors also purify previously-reported scales for aspects of female and male psychology – the ‘empathising’ (concerning relationships, communication and emotion) and the ‘systemising’ (concerning perceived mechanical/spatial interests) scales. The scales were purified using two separately-gathered calibration samples (n = 570 total). The dimensions were then demonstrated to hold consistently and be distinct from each other in a hold-out sample (n = 2578). The dimensions also hold consistently in a range of national markets/sub markets: Spain, Chinese and three UK sub markets: White, Asian and Afro-Caribbean. Across a range of markets (the above plus USA, Taiwan and Greece), females and males were significantly different on shopping style and Systemising (whilst the differences on empathising were less consistent). Females tended to have high ratings on the <b>shopping</b> style <b>scale</b> and to be empathisers. Males tended to have low ratings on the <b>shopping</b> style <b>scale</b> and to be systemisers. The <b>shopping</b> style <b>scale</b> offered slightly more precision in eliciting psychological differences between males and females than did the Systemising scale and considerably more than the Empathising one. An exploratory demonstration of the potential utility of the new gender <b>shopping</b> style <b>scale</b> was carried out; studying the extent to which shopping styles are culturally determined (they were more determined by sex than by self-reported national culture/sub-culture). Scaling up such a study to more countries and cultures could provide useful insights into the under-researched area of global vs. local shopping styles. The results do not provide support for other researchers’ suggestions that gender differences in human psychology arise from roles in society. Males and females differ in shopping style (and also in systemising and empathising) in national cultures where gender equality is relatively high as well as those where it is lower...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of online self-service quality {{has become increasingly}} crucial as firms deliver an expanding array of services through their Web sites. Substantial research examines online services using salient scales primarily developed for personnel-orchestrated, face-to-face services; several recently developed scales that target online services focus on important information and/or system characteristics but do not consider e-retailers' fundamental roles holistically. The reported research synthesizes relevant previous research and proposes a conceptual framework to examine the quality of online self-services in e-retailing. The proposed framework then guides a scale development effort that includes a series of pilot and validation studies. The resulting scale, e-SELFQUAL, provides a means for examining the relationships between online service quality and customer satisfaction, as well as loyalty in e-retailing. This study has several important implications for research and business practice. Service quality Self-services Online <b>shopping</b> <b>Scale</b> development...|$|R

40|$|Issue: Art glass, {{especially}} products {{produced at}} a studio (hot <b>shop)</b> <b>scale</b> by blowing or casting molten glass, {{represents one of}} the highest value uses for soda-lime glass. The retail value of these glass products is tremendous on a per pound basis. However, these applications are also among the most sensitive both to contaminants that might affect the clarity, and to chemistry that might affect the workability of the glass. This is a critical market barrier for the use of recycled glass. Although virgin raw material costs may appear high compared with recycled glass, in fact they are often {{a small fraction of the}} finished product prices in this application, so any risk associated with using recycled glass obviates against its use. However, in the right kinds of businesses, and if appropriate procedures are followed, hot shops can be successful in using recycled glass to create recycled content products. Best Practice: By carefully controlling batch formulas and melting procedures, recycled glass products can be manufactured with physical and aesthetic qualities similar to those made with virgin glass or batch materials. Obtaining a quality glass for blowing or casting from post-consumer bottle glass hinges on four processes: sourcing, cullet preparation, addition of batch chemicals, and melting. The sourcing of recycled glass requires a partnership with a collection program capable of producing a reliable stream of quality sorted material. The cullet must be free of dirt, rocks, metals, ceramics, and othe...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} and validation of a scale to measure online shopping addiction. Inspired by previous theories and research on behavioral addiction, the Griffiths's widely accepted six-factor component model was referred to and an 18 -item scale was constructed, with each component measured by three items. The results of exploratory factor analysis, based on Sample 1 (999 college students) and confirmatory factor analysis, based on Sample 2 (854 college students) showed the Griffiths's substantive six-factor structure underlay the online <b>shopping</b> addiction <b>scale.</b> Cronbach's alpha suggested that the resulting scale was highly reliable. Concurrent validity, based on Sample 3 (328 college students), was also satisfactory as indicated by correlations between the scale and measures of similar constructs.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the brand “owner” is very {{influential}} in positioning the brand and when the brand “owner” ceases his or her active role the brand will be perceived differently by the consumers. Balance Theory (HBT), a cognitive psychological theory, studies the triadic relationships between two persons and an entity and predicts that when a person’s original perception of the relationship is disturbed, the person restructures to a new balanced perception. Consequently, this research was undertaken to: conceptualize the brand owner’s impact on consumer’s brand perception; test the applicability of both the static and dynamic predictions of the Heider’s Balance Theory in brand owner-consumer-brand relation (OCB); construct and test a model of brand owner-consumer-brand relation; and examine if personality has an influence on OCB. A discovery-oriented approach was taken to understand the selected market segment, the ready-to-wear and diffusion lines of international designer labels. Chinese Brand Personality Scale, fashion proneness and hedonic and utilitarian <b>shopping</b> <b>scales</b> were developed, and validated. 51 customers were surveyed. Both traditional and extended methods used in the Balance Theory were employed in this study. Responses to liked brand have been used to test and develop the model, while those for disliked brand were used for test and confirmation. A “what if’ experimental approach was employed to test the applicability of dynamic HBT theory in OCB Model. The hypothesized OCB Model has been tested and validated. Consumers have been found to have separate views on the brand and the brand owner; and their responses to contrasting ethical and non-ethical news of the brand owner are different. Personality has been found to have an influence and two personality adapted models have been tested and validated. The actual results go beyond the prediction of the Balance Theory. Dominant triple positive balance mode, dominant negative balance mode, and mode of extreme antipathy have been found. It has been found that not all balanced modes are good for the brand. Contrary to Heider’s findings, simply liking may not necessarily lead to unit relation in the OCB Model. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
