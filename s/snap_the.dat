5|$|The {{offensive}} team must {{line up in}} a legal formation {{before they}} can <b>snap</b> <b>the</b> ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if {{there are more than}} four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line. Players can temporarily line up in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, {{with the exception of the}} snapper, are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.|$|E
5|$|Three {{positions}} {{are specific to}} the field goal and PAT (point-after-touchdown) unit: the placekicker (K or PK), holder (H) and long snapper (LS). The long snapper's job is to <b>snap</b> <b>the</b> football to the holder, who will catch and position it for the placekicker. There is not usually a holder on kickoffs, because the ball is kicked off of a tee; however, a holder {{may be used in}} certain situations, such as if wind is preventing the ball from remaining upright on the tee. The player on the receiving team who catches the ball is known as the kickoff returner (KR).|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed to {{him to be a}} disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the line of scrimmage and the snap from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to <b>snap</b> <b>the</b> ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the quarterback}} {{commands}} the ball, it is <b>the</b> center's <b>snap</b> that renders <b>the</b> ball in play; {{the defensive line}} may not cross {{the line of scrimmage}} until <b>the</b> center <b>snaps</b> <b>the</b> football. An astute center can help draw an opposing team offside prior to <b>the</b> <b>snap</b> or potentially trick the other team into a penalty by quickly <b>snapping</b> <b>the</b> ball while the opposing team attempts to substitute players.|$|R

5|$|The Jets {{opened the}} 2014 {{season with a}} 19–14 win over the Oakland Raiders but {{proceeded}} to lose their next eight games. Geno Smith, who started the year at quarterback, was replaced by veteran Michael Vick midway through the season. Vick helped to <b>snap</b> <b>the</b> losing streak in a Week 9 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Despite the victory, Ryan was seen cursing at an unidentified person and was subsequently fined $100,000 by the league. The team continued to struggle with Smith eventually being reinserted into the lineup. The Jets {{went on to win}} two of their last three games to finish with a 4–12 record, their worst finish under Ryan. Despite players again expressing their desire for Ryan to remain the coach, he was dismissed on December 29, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Lobos {{began the}} second half of the game with a kickoff to Navy, and after an {{unsuccessful}} drive from each team, the Midshipmen began a drive on their own 25-yard line with 11:30 left in the quarter. With 7:01 left, Polanco scored another rushing touchdown for the Midshipmen, this time for 28 yards. The next Lobos drive began with two penalties from the Midshipmen, moving New Mexico from its own 31-yard line to Navy's 49 before their first <b>snap.</b> <b>The</b> Lobos moved 48 yards over the course of eight plays and almost five minutes of game time, but the team committed a turnover on downs inches away from the goal line when running back D.D. Cox was forced out of bounds on fourth down, preventing the team from scoring any points. Getting the ball back with a 31–19 lead, Navy began their next drive on their own 1-yard line with 1:41 remaining in the third quarter. Polanco rushed for three more plays before the end of the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{crowd is}} {{notoriously}} loud during Seahawks games. It has twice held the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar {{at an outdoor}} stadium, first at 136.6 decibels in 2013, followed by a measurement of 137.6 decibels in 2014. Both records were eventually broken by crowds at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The current record was set by fans at Arrowhead on September 29, 2014, in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots, hitting 142.2 decibels. The noise {{has contributed to the}} team's home field advantage with an increase in false start (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) and delay of game (failure of the offense to <b>snap</b> <b>the</b> ball prior to the play clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams. The stadium was the first in the NFL to implement a FieldTurf artificial field. Numerous college and high school American football games have also been played at the stadium.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two main}} ways that the offense can advance the ball: running and passing. In a typical play, the quarterback calls the play, and the center passes the ball {{backwards}} and under his legs to the quarterback in {{a process known as}} the <b>snap.</b> <b>The</b> quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball or runs with it himself. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out of bounds, or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can only be legally attempted if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage. In the NFL, a down also ends if the runner's helmet comes off.|$|E

25|$|Modifying {{the rule}} {{regarding}} offensive substitutions made and rushing to <b>snap</b> <b>the</b> ball before the defense {{can make their}} changes; eliminating the five yard penalty for the first offense (but stopping play and warning the offensive team), but maintaining the 15 yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for further violations.|$|E

25|$|International Criminal Court Complaint, 2011 On September 13, 2011, {{attorneys}} {{from the}} Center for Constitutional Rights {{and leaders of}} <b>SNAP,</b> <b>the</b> Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, formally {{filed a complaint with}} the International Criminal Court (ICC) charging top Vatican officials for tolerating and enabling the concealment of rape and child sex crimes worldwide. At least 20,000 pages of reports, policy papers, and crime evidence by Catholic clergy supplemented the complaint.|$|E
25|$|A mid-diastolic {{rumbling}} murmur with presystolic accentuation will {{be heard}} after the opening <b>snap.</b> <b>The</b> murmur is best heard at the apical region and is not radiated. Since it is a low-pitch sound, it is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope. Its duration increases with worsening disease. Rolling the patient toward left as well as isometric exercise will accentuate the murmur. A thrill might be present when palpating at the apical region of the precordium.|$|E

25|$|While SNAP {{participants}} and other low-income nonparticipants spend similar amounts on food spending, SNAP participants tend to still experience greater food insecurity than nonparticipants. This {{is believed to}} be a reflection of welfare of individuals who take the time to apply for SNAP benefits than the shortcomings of <b>SNAP.</b> <b>The</b> theory behind this is that those households facing the greatest hardships are the most likely to bear of the burden of applying for program benefits. Therefore, SNAP participants tend to be, on average, less food secure than other low-income nonparticipants.|$|E
25|$|Window {{management}} in Windows 7 has several new features: Snap maximizes a window {{when it is}} dragged {{to the top of}} the screen. Dragging windows to the left or right edges of the screen allows users to snap software windows to either side of the screen, such that the windows take up half the screen. When a user moves windows that were snapped or maximized using <b>Snap,</b> <b>the</b> system restores their previous state. Snap functions can also be triggered with keyboard shortcuts. Shake hides all inactive windows when the active window's title bar is dragged back and forth rapidly (metaphorically shaken).|$|E
25|$|The two teams’ {{defenses}} {{seemed to}} dominate {{most of the}} first half. The Rams started the game out strong by taking the opening kickoff and marching to the Tennessee 17-yard line. But on third down, safety Blaine Bishop pressured quarterback Kurt Warner to throw an incomplete pass. Then the ensuing field goal attempt failed when punter/holder Mike Horan fumbled the <b>snap.</b> <b>The</b> Titans responded by moving {{the ball to the}} St. Louis 29-yard line, aided with running back Eddie George's 32-yard reception. However, they also came up empty after kicker Al Del Greco missed a 47-yard field goal attempt.|$|E

25|$|In 1918, Kuhn re-signed {{with the}} Class-B Dallas Giants of the Texas League. That year, as World War I was underway, {{he was drafted}} into the United States Army. Kuhn's rank was Sergeant. During combat {{training}} in San Antonio, Texas, Kuhn's roommate snapped a towel at Kuhn in an attempt at a practical joke. The towel hit his eye, causing him to lose his sight entirely. One other account of the incident story stated {{that it was a}} fight that caused Kuhn's roommate to <b>snap</b> <b>the</b> towel, which caused him to lose his sight. After the incident Kuhn was honorably discharged.|$|E
25|$|In the animation, {{juvenile}} herring {{hunt the}} copepods in synchronization: The copepods sense with their antennae the pressure-wave {{of an approaching}} herring and react with a fast escape jump. The length of the jump is fairly constant. The fish align themselves in a grid with this characteristic jump length. A copepod can dart about 80 times before it tires out. After a jump, it takes it 60 milliseconds to spread its antennae again, and this time delay becomes its undoing, as the almost endless stream of herrings allows a herring to eventually <b>snap</b> <b>the</b> copepod. A single juvenile herring could never catch a large copepod.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{opened his}} first fall {{practice}} on September 1. At that time, ten players from previous Alabama squads returned and included T. L. Brown, Jack Hovater, Walter E. Hovater, Ralph Lee Jones, Mullie Lenoir, Emmet Noland, J. T. O'Connor, Ike Rogers, Tram Sessions and Riggs Stephenson. After {{two weeks of}} practice, Scott divided the players into four teams {{in order to determine}} starting line-ups. At his time Scott also did not utilize a quarterback, but instead would simply <b>snap</b> <b>the</b> ball directly to the runner. Before game preparation began for their game against Birmingham–Southern, Ike Rogers was selected as team captain for the season by the returning lettermen on September 25. Rogers was previously elected to serve as team captain for the 1918 season that was cancelled.|$|E

50|$|In most offenses the {{tailback}} was {{the main}} ball handler and generator of offense; however, the fullback could also take <b>the</b> direct <b>snap</b> due to his proximity to the tailback.
