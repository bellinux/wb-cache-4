Conventionally, sugarcane N concentration is examined using direct methods such as collecting leaf samples from the field followed by analytical assays in the laboratory. These methods do not offer real-time, quick, and non-destructive strategies for estimating sugarcane N concentration. Methods that take advantage of remote sensing, particularly hyperspectral data, can present reliable techniques for predicting <b>sugarcane</b> <b>leaf</b> N concentration. Hyperspectral data are extremely large and of high dimensionality. Many hyperspectral features are redundant due to the strong correlation between wavebands that are adjacent. Hence, the analysis of hyperspectral data is complex and needs to be simplified by selecting the most relevant spectral features. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of a random forest (RF) regression algorithm for selecting spectral features in hyperspectral data necessary for predicting <b>sugarcane</b> <b>leaf</b> N concentration. To achieve this, two Hyperion images were captured from fields of 6 – 7 month-old sugarcane, variety N 19. The machine-learning RF algorithm was used as a feature-selection and regression method to analyse the spectral data. Stepwise multiple linear (SML) regression was also examined to predict the concentration of <b>sugarcane</b> <b>leaf</b> N after the reduction of the redundancy in hyperspectral data. The results showed that <b>sugarcane</b> <b>leaf</b> N concentration can be predicted using both non– linear RF regression (coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0. 67; root mean square error of validation (RMSEV) = 0. 15 %; 8. 44 % of the mean) and SML regression models (R 2 = 0. 71; RMSEV = 0. 19 %; 10. 39 % of the mean) derived from the first-order derivative of reflectance.

In an attempt to identify other major pathogenicity factors, we screened 1, 216 independent Tn 5 insertions in Xa strain XaFL 07 - 1 by single inoculation onto sugarcane cultivar CP 80 - 1743. Mutants were screened for reduced pathogenicity (i. e., capacity to induce leaf symptoms and to multiply in the sugarcane stalk). Five independent Tn 5 insertions were found in gene XALc_ 0557, which is predicted to encode an OmpA family outer membrane protein. Each of these insertions resulted in a mutant strain that elicited very slight to no symptoms and {{was not able to}} move as efficiently within the sugarcane stalk, both spatially and in intensity, as wild type XaFL 07 - 1.

A sensitivity level of detection of 40 - 400 cells/reaction was obtained using PCR from exponentially grown bacterial cultures and of 1 - 10 cells in cane internode scrapings and leaf sheath fluid samples using nested PCR. The specificity of the primer set was demonstrated by the lack of amplification product formation in PCR by closely related acetic acid bacteria, including Gluconacetobacter liquefaciens, and Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus.

The complex genetic architecture and the lack of a complete genomic sequence in sugarcane hamper the adoption of molecular approaches to study its physiology and to develop new varieties. Investments on the development of new sugarcane varieties have been made to maximize sucrose yield, a trait dependent on photosynthetic capacity. However, detailed studies on sugarcane leaves are scarce. In this work, we report the first molecular and physiological characterization of events taking place along a leaf developmental gradient in sugarcane. Photosynthetic response to CO 2 indicated divergence in photosynthetic capacity based on PEPcase activity, corroborated by activity quantification (both in vivo and in vitro) and distinct levels of carbon discrimination on different segments along leaf length. Additionally, leaf segments had contrasting amount of chlorophyll, nitrogen and sugars. RNA-Seq data indicated a plethora of biochemical pathways differentially expressed along the leaf.

Although limited in some aspects, the comparison to maize indicates that all data acquired on one C 4 species cannot always be easily extrapolated to other species. However, our data indicates that some transcriptional factors were segment-specific and the <b>sugarcane</b> <b>leaf</b> undergoes through the process of suberizarion, photosynthesis establishment and senescence...|$|R

Abstract: The pear <b>leaf</b> blister <b>mite</b> can cause severe damage to pear leaves and young fruits in some regions. Due to hidden living inside <b>leaf</b> blisters, the <b>mites</b> are largely protected against the impact of plant protecting agents. Until now, treatments with mineral oil or rape oil in early spring, during the time when the mites leave their hibernation sites under the bud scales to invade the young leaves and blossoms, are the only possibility to control these mites in Swiss organic fruit growing. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of sulphur, mineral oil and Surround®WP applied after harvest during the time, when the mites leave their blisters and migrate to their hibernation sites. The different treatments were applied shortly after harvest to benefit from the mild temperatures in September. Counting the number of mites after dissection of the buds in laboratory in autumn and spring showed a good efficacy for all treatments. But the visual control in spring during bloom could not verify these results for all treatments. Only the sulphur-treated trees were virtually free of blisters in spring. With a corrected efficacy (Abbott’s formula) of 95...|$|R
50|$|The {{only known}} host plant for B. steniellus is the sugarcane. The female moth lays {{a batch of}} 100 to 300 eggs on the midrib of a <b>sugarcane</b> <b>leaf.</b> The larvae hatch out after about a week and {{make their way into}} the stem by {{drilling}} holes just above a node. They excavate galleries inside the stem, feeding voraciously. When the cane dries up and the crown of leaves dies in about ten days, the larvae move to a different cane in the vicinity. They feed for three to four weeks, passing through five instar stages, before pupating inside a stem. The adult moths emerge in six to twelve days. The male/female ratio varies between forty and sixty percent in the different generations. The whole life cycle lasts about five or six weeks, and there may be two or three generations in each year.|$|R
50|$|The completed, domed {{framework}} {{is covered with}} thatch (lau leaves), which is made by the women. The best quality of thatch is made with the dry leaves of the <b>sugarcane.</b> If <b>sugarcane</b> <b>leaf</b> was not available, the palm leaves of the coconut tree {{was used in the}} same manner. The long, dry leaves are twisted over a three-foot length of lafo, which are then fastened by a thin strip of the frond of the coconut being threaded through the leaves close up to the lafo stem. These sections of thatch are fastened to the outside of the framework of the fale beginning at the bottom and working up to the apex. They are overlapped, so each section advances the thatching about three inches. This means there is really a double layer of thatch covering the whole house. The sections are fastened to the aso at each end by afa.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Large {{farmland}} {{areas and}} the knowledge on the interaction between solar radiation and vegetation canopies have increased the use of data from orbital remote sensors in sugarcane monitoring. However, the constituents of the atmosphere affect the reflectance values obtained by imaging sensors. This study aimed at improving a <b>sugarcane</b> <b>Leaf</b> Area Index (LAI) estimation model, concerning the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) subjected to atmospheric correction. The model generated by the NDVI with atmospheric correction showed the best results (R 2 = 0. 84; d = 0. 95; MAE = 0. 44; RMSE = 0. 55), {{in relation to the}} other models compared. LAI estimation with this model, during the sugarcane plant cycle, reached a maximum of 4. 8 at the vegetative growth phase and 2. 3 {{at the end of the}} maturation phase. Thus, the use of atmospheric correction to estimate the sugarcane LAI is recommended, since this procedure increases the correlations between the LAI estimated by image and by plant parameters...|$|R
