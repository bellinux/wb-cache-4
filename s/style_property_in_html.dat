50|$|The {{building}} is locally significant {{as the best}} preserved Queen Anne <b>style</b> <b>property</b> <b>in</b> the area. It is a three story building with an octagonal turret. The house had remained in the family from its construction in 1913 until at least 1994, although it was unoccupied since 1981. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.|$|R

40|$|MysterX is an {{object-oriented}} Scheme toolkit {{for building}} applications from off-the-shelf COM components. While the COM support in languages such as Haskell and Mercury requires {{the use of}} an interface compiler to generate stub code, MysterX uses the reflective capabilities of OLE Automation to make value-marshalling decisions at run-time. MysterX hosts COM components in windows that display Dynamic HTML, without requiring a separate browser. Scheme code can manipulate HTML elements and their <b>style</b> <b>properties</b> <b>in</b> such windows to create interesting visual effects. Event handlers written in Scheme can be associated with HTML elements and COM objects. By integrating these diverse technologies, MysterX can be used to write complete GUI applications. 1 : Introduction MysterX is an object-oriented Scheme toolkit for building interactive applications with components that adhere to the Component Object Model (COM). COM allows applications to be built from off-the-shelf components. Components an [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Web {{forms are}} the {{interfaces}} {{of the deep}} web. Though modern web browsers provide facilities to assist in form filling, this assistance is limited to prior form fillings or keyword matching. Automatic form understanding enables {{a broad range of}} applications, including crawlers, meta-search engines, and usability and accessibility support for enhanced web browsing. In this demonstration, we use a novel form understanding approach, OPAL, to assist in form filling even for complex, previously unknown forms. OPAL associates form labels to fields by analyzing structural <b>properties</b> <b>in</b> the <b>HTML</b> encoding and visual features of the page rendering. OPAL interprets this labeling and classifies the fields according to a given domain ontology. The combination of these two properties, allows OPAL to deal effectively with many forms outside of the grasp of existing form filling techniques. In the UK real estate domain, OPAL achieves > 99 % accuracy in form understanding. Copyright is held by the International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW 3 C 2) ...|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the years}} {{there have been}} a variety of mixed <b>styles</b> of <b>properties</b> <b>in</b> the village, {{beginning}} with Pre-Fabs (prefabricated structures with tin roofs) which were then replaced with more substantial council authority brick-built homes.The village today consists of detached, semi detached, terraced, bungalows, cottages, miners row cottages (most of which are council authority and/or privately owned former local authority properties) and also fully renovated former derelict properties and new builds such as Salsburgh Meadows and the new builds situated in sections of Main Street.The mix of old (miners rows) and new (Salsburgh Meadows) makes the village quaint and gives it a certain charm retaining the old buildings from years gone by.|$|R
5000|$|Street clocks were {{installed}} in many American cities from the 1860s to early-20th century, {{with the two}} largest manufacturers on the East Coast being the Seth Thomas Clock Company and the E. Howard Clock & Watch Company. The Baxter Clock {{stands in front of}} 323 Pollock Street, a Dutch Revival <b>style</b> <b>property</b> built <b>in</b> 1918 that was the longtime home of the Baxter's Jewelry Store and currently home to the Fine Art at Baxters gallery. [...] It was manufactured by the Seth Thomas Clock Company of Thomaston, Connecticut. The clock was built in 1920, but features a style and design similar to ones made in the late-19th century. Baxter's Jewelry Store, previously located on Middle Street, moved to Pollock Street around 1920, but didn't have the clock installed until 1930. [...] It was listed on the NRHP on July 2, 1973. [...] The clock was also designated a contributing property to the New Bern Historic District, which was listed on the NRHP on June 19, 1973.|$|R

40|$|Modularisation is {{important}} for managing the complex structures that arise in large theorem proving problems, and in large software and/or hardware development projects. This paper studies some properties of logical systems that support the definition, combination, parameterisation and reuse of modules. Our results show some new connections among: (1) the preservation of various kinds of conservative extension under pushouts; (2) various distributive laws for information hiding over sums; and (3) (Craig <b>style)</b> interpolation <b>properties.</b> <b>In</b> addition, we study differences between syntactic and semantic formulations of conservative extension properties, and of distributive laws. A model theoretic property that we call exactness {{plays an important role}} in some results. This paper explores the interplay between syntax and semantics, and thus lies in the tradition of abstract model theory. We represent logical systems as institutions.

50|$|The {{major roads}} in Kennebunkport village are Western Avenue, which runs {{southwest}} {{to cross the}} river into Kennebunk, North Street, which runs inland, and Ocean and Maine Streets, which run parallel to the river, southward toward Cape Arundel. The district extends along these roads, and includes numerous properties on the side streets which connect them. It has 147 buildings, of which only 24 were built after 1925. Most of these later structures (for example, the 1960 town offices) are <b>in</b> sympathetic <b>styles.</b> Residential <b>properties</b> <b>in</b> the district are typically high-quality vernacular interpretations of architectural styles popular {{at the time of}} their construction. A few houses date to the colonial period, including the 1745 Gideon Walker House on South Street, which was altered to plans by John Calvin Stevens in 1910. The largest number of buildings in the district are from the Federal period, when Kennebunkport was at its economic height. One of the finest houses from this period is the Capt. Nathaniel Lord Mansion, separately listed on the National Register in 1973.|$|R
