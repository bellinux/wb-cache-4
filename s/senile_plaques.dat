5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease has}} been {{identified}} as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein, and tau protein in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (Aβ). Aβ is a fragment from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as <b>senile</b> <b>plaques.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} an incurable {{neurodegenerative}} disease which most often affects {{the elderly and}} {{accounts for more than}} half of all cases of dementia. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a protein misfolding disease. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic aggregations of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger <b>senile</b> <b>plaques,</b> a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.|$|E
5|$|The genetic {{heritability}} of Alzheimer's disease (and memory components thereof), {{based on}} reviews of twin and family studies, ranges from 49% to 79%. Around 0.1% {{of the cases}} are familial forms of autosomal (not sex-linked) dominant inheritance, which have an onset before age 65. This form of the disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Most of autosomal dominant familial AD {{can be attributed to}} mutations in one of three genes: those encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called Aβ42, which is the main component of <b>senile</b> <b>plaques.</b> Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms—particularly Aβ40—without increasing Aβ42 levels.|$|E

For {{a better understanding of}} the role of lipids, especially during the amyloid-β peptide aggregation, it is crucial to determine the composition of the <b>senile</b> <b>plaque</b> versus the surrounding tissue, that is, the neuropil. Results: A laser microdissection step was added to the analysis by UPLC-MS/MS. Despite the very low amount of sample, two phosphatidylcholines that were significantly depleted in the <b>senile</b> <b>plaque</b> were identified. Conclusion: Changes in the phospholipid content have been shown between <b>senile</b> <b>plaque</b> versus neuropil.

5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and <b>senile</b> <b>plaques,</b> characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are not common unless the person is demented.|$|E

2500|$|Systems biology {{approaches}} to Alzheimer’s disease that consider the biochemical pathways {{that are important}} in CNS disease evolution have been developed by research that was funded outside NASA. Figure 6-8 shows a schematic of the biochemical pathways {{that are important in}} the development of Alzheimer’s disease. The description of the interaction of space radiation within these pathways would be one approach to developing predictive models of space radiation risks. For example, if the pathways that were studied in animal models could be correlated with studies in humans who are suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, an approach to describe risk that uses biochemical degrees-of-freedom could be pursued. Edelstein-Keshet and Spiros [...] have developed an in silico model of <b>senile</b> <b>plaques</b> that are related to Alzheimer’s disease. In this model, the biochemical interactions among TNF, IL-1B, and IL-6 are described within several important cell populations, including astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Further, in this model soluble amyloid causes microglial chemotaxis and activates IL-1B secretion. Figure 6-9 shows the results of the Edelstein-Keshet and Spiros model simulating plaque formation and neuronal death. Establishing links between space radiation-induced changes to the changes that are described in this approach can be pursued to develop an in silico model of Alzheimer’s disease that results from space radiation.|$|E

2500|$|Pathologically, DLB is {{characterized}} by the development of abnormal collections of (alpha-synuclein) protein within the cytoplasm of neurons (known as Lewy bodies). These intracellular collections of protein have similar structural features to [...] "classical" [...] Lewy bodies, seen subcortically in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, those affected by DLB experience a loss of dopamine-producing neurons (in the substantia nigra) {{in a manner similar to}} that seen in Parkinson's disease. A loss of acetylcholine-producing neurons (in the basal nucleus of Meynert and elsewhere) similar to that seen in Alzheimer's disease also is known to occur in those with DLB. Cerebral atrophy also occurs as the cerebral cortex degenerates. [...] Autopsy series have revealed the pathology of DLB is often concomitant with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. That is, when Lewy body inclusions are found in the cortex, they often co-occur with Alzheimer's disease pathology found primarily in the hippocampus, including <b>senile</b> <b>plaques</b> (deposited beta-amyloid protein), and granulovacuolar degeneration (grainy deposits within and a clear zone around hippocampal neurons). Neurofibrillary tangles (abnormally phosphorylated tau protein) are less common in DLB, although they are known to occur, and astrocyte abnormalities are also known to occur. Presently, whether DLB is an Alzheimer's variant or a separate disease entity is not clear. Unlike Alzheimer's disease, the brain may appear grossly normal with no visible signs of atrophy.|$|E
50|$|Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} condition {{characterized by}} two hallmarks: <b>senile</b> <b>plaques</b> and the neurofibrillary tangle. <b>Senile</b> <b>plaques</b> are extracellular aggregations of amyloid-b (Aβ) protein.

40|$|AbstractWe {{analyzed}} an amino-terminal {{modification of}} β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide in brain, using anti-Aβ antibodies that distinguish distinct molecular species. Examination of cortical sections from 28 aged {{individuals with a}} wide range in <b>senile</b> <b>plaque</b> density revealed that a molecular species distinct from the standard Aβ is deposited in the brain in a dominant and differential manner. This modified Aβ peptide (AβN 3 (pE)) starts at the 3 rd amino-terminal residue of the standard Aβ, glutamate, converted to pyroglutamate through intramolecular dehydration. Because plaques composed of AβN 3 (pE) are present in equivalent or greater densities than those composed of standard Aβ bearing the first aminoterminal residue (AβN 1) and because deposition of the former species appears to precede deposition of the latter, as confirmed with specimens from Down's syndrome patients, the processes involved in AβN 3 (pE) production and retention may play an early and critical role in <b>senile</b> <b>plaque</b> formation...|$|R

Although Aβ42 makes up less than 10% of total AB, it aggregates at much faster rates than Aβ40. Aβ42 is the initial and major component of <b>senile</b> <b>plaque</b> deposits.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the clinical and pathological {{features of a}} subgroup of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) who exhibited early and disproportionately severe impairments on tests of frontal lobe functioning. We hypothesized that these patients would exhibit {{a greater degree of}} either neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) or <b>senile</b> <b>plaque</b> pathology in the frontal lobes than would patients with typical AD. Design and Outcome Measures: We examined the neuropsychological profiles and <b>senile</b> <b>plaque</b> and NFT accumulation in the frontal, entorhinal, temporal, and parietal cortices in 3 patients with AD who exhibited disproportionate frontal impairments during early stages of dementia (frontal AD) and 3 matched patients with typical AD (typical AD). Results: Compared with the typical AD group, the frontal AD group performed significantly worse on 2 tests of frontal lobe functioning and on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Block Design test. No significant group differences were found on other tests. Analysis of brain tissue samples demonstrated that, despite comparable entorhinal, temporal, and parietal NFT loads, the frontal AD group showed a significantly higher NFT load in the frontal cortex than the typical AD group. <b>Senile</b> <b>plaque</b> pathology in the frontal and entorhinal cortices did not differentiate the 2 groups. Conclusions: We identified a subgroup of patients with pathologically confirmed AD who presented {{in the early stages of}} dementia with disproportionate impairments on tests of frontal lobe functioning and had a greater-than-expected degree of NFT pathology in the frontal lobes, suggesting the existence of a frontal variant of AD that has distinctive clinical and pathological features...|$|R
