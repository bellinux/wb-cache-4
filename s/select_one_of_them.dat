Furthermore, since convex or monotone spline interpolants are in general not uniquely determined, a strategy for <b>selecting</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> is proposed...|$|R

50|$|A {{military}} dictatorship (also {{known as a}} military junta) {{is a form of}} government different from civilian dictatorship for a number of reasons: their motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule, {{and the ways in which}} they leave power.

For example, many juntas adopttitles, such as “National Redemption Council", “Committee of National Restoration", or “National Liberation Committee".
