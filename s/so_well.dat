25|$|Due to the 2015 Yemeni Civil War, the {{situation}} is increasingly dire. 80% of Yemen's population struggles to access water to drink and bathe.

5|$|Director Brenda Chapman briefly voiced Miriam {{when she}} sings the lullaby to Moses. The vocals had been {{recorded}} for a scratch audio track, which {{was intended to}} be replaced later by Sally Dworsky. The track turned out <b>so</b> <b>well</b> that it remained in the film.|$|E
5|$|Galloways have a thick {{double-layered}} {{coat that}} is wavy or curly. This thick coat of hair insulates their bodies <b>so</b> <b>well</b> {{that they have}} a minimal outer layer of fat on their bodies, which would otherwise create waste at slaughter. This coat sheds out in the summer months and in warmer climates. Despite the animal's usual use in beef production, there is evidence of Galloway herds being milked in Cumberland for cheese production.|$|E
5|$|In December 1792, Hohenlohe-Kirchberg's forces defended Trier {{from the}} Army of the Moselle <b>so</b> <b>well</b> that its commander, General of Division Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville, {{was removed from}} his command by his {{superiors}} in Paris. On 31December, Hohenlohe-Kirchberg was awarded the Grand Cross of Military Order of Maria Theresa for his success at Trier.|$|E

5|$|Maureen Ryan {{believed}} {{that one of}} the reasons the episode worked <b>so</b> <b>well</b> was because it left out the storylines with the Night's Watch and the Dothraki and focused in a single location. VanDerWerff agreed, and added that with each episode the writers got bolder in the sense that they added new scenes not included in the book to round out the source material.|$|E

5|$|Supporting {{cast members}} were added {{throughout}} {{the run of}} the show. The only addition with no professional acting experience was the Holmfirth resident Gordon Wharmby, who performed <b>so</b> <b>well</b> during his audition as mechanic Wesley Pegden that Alan J. W. Bell cast him in one episode. Pegden became a regular character after a positive audience reception.|$|E

5|$|The Epistles are {{admired for}} the way that their poetry and music fit <b>so</b> <b>well</b> together. Bellman chose not to compose the tunes, instead {{borrowing}} and adapting existing melodies, most likely to exploit the humour of contrasting the associations of well-known tunes with the meanings he gave them. This {{may also have been}} intended to provide historical depth to his work; he sometimes devoted considerable energy to adapting melodies to fit an Epistle's needs.|$|E

Because Sasha does <b>so</b> <b>well</b> on the patrol, Tigerstar invites her {{to spend the night}} in the warriors den. Enjoying herself immensely, Sasha accepts.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are <b>so</b> <b>well</b> adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E

5|$|Amanda Clement {{was born}} in Hudson, South Dakota, then part of the Dakota Territory, on March 20, 1888 to Harriet Clement, one of the {{original}} settlers of Eden, South Dakota, and her husband, who died when Amanda was very young. In 1904 Clement traveled to Hawarden, Iowa to watch her brother Hank pitch in a semi-professional game. The umpire for the amateur game taking place before Hank's did not show, and Hank suggested that Amanda, who had played baseball with her brothers and was knowledgeable about the game, serve as the umpire. In so doing, Clement became the first woman paid to umpire a baseball game. Her performance was <b>so</b> <b>well</b> received that she was hired to umpire further semi-professional games.|$|E
5|$|Before its release, IGN {{was highly}} anticipating {{the final version}} of the game as they had played two {{previous}} versions of the game already. Concentrating on the multiplayer aspect of the game, they praised the developers for moving a solely platform game into the multiplayer genre <b>so</b> <b>well.</b> Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal was featured at the E3 games festival in 2004, where there was a playable demo. Only the multiplayer Siege mode and a single-player demo were available but they were enough to get 1UP.com's award for best action game at E3.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter, in {{this fight}} with others of his small {{regiment}} at Fairfield, stood against two of the crack brigades of Stuart's cavalry. The 6th Cavalry's stand {{was considered one of}} the most gallant in its history and helped influence the outcome the battles being fought around Gettysburg. While the 6th Cavalry regiment was cut to pieces, it fought <b>so</b> <b>well</b> that its squadrons were regarded as the advance of a large body of troops. The senior officer of those brigades was later criticized severely for being delayed by such an inferior force. Had the 6th Cavalry regiment not made their stand, the two brigades of Virginians could have caused serious problems to the Union rear areas.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{increase}} in people hit by trains in 2013, in late 2013 and early 2014 the MTA started a test program at one undisclosed station, with four systems and strategies to eliminate {{the number of people}} hit by trains. Closed-circuit television cameras, a web of laser beams stretched across the tracks, radio frequencies transmitted across the tracks, and thermal imaging cameras focused on the station's tracks were set to be installed at that station. At the unidentified station, tests have gone <b>so</b> <b>well</b> at the testing site that these track protection systems will be installed systemwide as part of the 2015–2019 capital program.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Adolf Hitler {{presented}} the palace {{as a reward}} to Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, who made it personal headquarters. This explains why the palace was <b>so</b> <b>well</b> preserved. The building was later converted into a museum for Wehrmacht officers stationed in and around Crimea. Originally, the Nazis had planned to dynamite the palace, but the rapid advance of the Separate Coastal Army and supporting Yalta partisan groups during the Crimean Offensive saved the palace from destruction.|$|E
5|$|Frakes {{believes}} that the main themes of First Contact—and Star Trek as a whole—are loyalty, friendship, honesty and mutual respect. This {{is evident in the}} film when Picard chooses to rescue Data rather than evacuate the ship {{with the rest of the}} crew. The film makes a direct comparison between Picard's hatred of the Borg and refusal to destroy the Enterprise and that of Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick. The moment marks a turning point in the film as Picard changes his mind, symbolized by his putting down his gun. A similar Moby-Dick reference was made in , and although Braga and Moore did not want to repeat it, they decided it worked <b>so</b> <b>well</b> they could not leave it out.|$|E
