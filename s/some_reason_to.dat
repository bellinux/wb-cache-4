5|$|The {{consequences}} of Ellandun {{went beyond the}} immediate loss of Mercian power in the southeast. According to the Chronicle, the East Anglians asked for Ecgberht's protection against the Mercians in the same year, 825, though it may actually {{have been in the}} following year that the request was made. In 826 Beornwulf invaded East Anglia, presumably to recover his overlordship. He was slain, however, as was his successor, Ludeca, who invaded East Anglia in 827, evidently for the same reason. It may be that the Mercians were hoping for support from Kent: there was <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suppose that Wulfred, the Archbishop of Canterbury, might be discontented with West Saxon rule, as Ecgberht had terminated Wulfred's currency and had begun to mint his own, at Rochester and Canterbury, and it is known that Ecgberht seized property belonging to Canterbury. The outcome in East Anglia was a disaster for the Mercians which confirmed West Saxon power in the southeast.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{the triumph}} of de Saxe over the British {{inspired}} the second Jacobite rising, the Forty-Five, under the Young Pretender, Bonnie Prince Charlie. Charles, with a small contingent of troops, returned to Scotland and invaded England. He had <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe in his ultimate success as all but 8,000 British troops were away on the continent and recently defeated at Fontenoy. Charles' return to Scotland combined with a stunning victory at the Battle of Prestonpans obliged Cumberland to pull his army back to England {{to deal with the}} Jacobite invasion. The British government was greatly concerned with developments in Flanders but the military tide had turned in France's favour. Dendermonde and the vital port of Ostend, where a battalion of British Foot Guards and a garrison of 4,000 fell to French forces in August, and Nieuport in early September. The only good news for the British came in North America when William Pepperrell captured the key French fortress of Louisbourg at Cape Breton in late June.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} available thus {{seems to}} indicate that the Indians of Robeson County who have been called Croatan and Cherokee are descended mainly from certain Siouan tribes of which the most prominent were the Cheraw and Keyauwee, but they probably included as well remnants of the Eno, and Shakori, and very likely some of the coastal groups such as the Waccamaw and Cape Fears. It is not improbable that a few families or small groups of Algonquian or Iroquoian may have cast their lot with this body of people, but contributions from such sources are relatively insignificant. Although there is <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> think that the Keyauwee tribe actually contributed more blood to the Robeson County Indians than any other, the name is not widely known, whereas that of the Cheraw has been familiar to historians, geographers and ethnologists {{in one form or another}} since the time of De Soto and has a firm position in the cartography of the region. The Cheraws, too, seem to have taken a leading part in opposing the colonists during and immediately after the Yamasee uprising. Therefore, if the name of any tribe is to be used in connection with this body of six or eight thousand people, that of the Cheraw would, in my opinion, be most appropriate.|$|E

Amelia Heinle, who critics praised for her portrayal of Victoria, has been listed on the [...] "Top 5 Actresses" [...] poll of CBS Soaps In Depth for over eight consecutive weeks.

Elinor Donahue, who portrayed the judge that marries Victoria and Billy, said she thought their [...] "retro wedding" [...] was [...] "adorable" [...] and [...] "extremely well written and not overdone". Zap2it placed Victoria and Billy at number four of their [...] "10 Best Soap Couples of 2011". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it said Victoria and Billy are [...] "so scrumptious together", and that [...] "it's so nice to have <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> say something kind about The Young and the Restless for a change".

Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote of their relationship: [...] "Billy (Billy Miller) and Victoria (Amelia Heinle), who have already had three weddings in the year and a half that they have been together, actually seem rational. They should change the wedding vows in the G.C. from [...] "until death to us part," [...] to [...] "until one of us changes our mind." [...] However, Bibel was later unfavorable of the couple attempting to have a child less than six months after marrying.|$|E

50|$|The strongest {{support for}} open {{rebellion}} {{came from the}} poorest peasants.

2500|$|There is <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> {{believe that}} Reuss {{suffered}} a stroke {{in the spring of}} 1920, but this is not entirely certain. Crowley wrote to W.T.

He hastily issued honorary diplomas of the Seventh Degree to various people, some of whom had no right to anything at all and some of whom were only cheap crooks." [...] Shortly after appointing him his Viceroy for Australia, Crowley appears to have corresponded with his friend Frank (Allan) Bennett and discussed with him his doubts about Reuss's continuing ability to effectively govern the Order.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, the Supreme Court also {{recognized}} [...] "The ordinary default rule, of course, admits of exceptions. ...

See, e.g., FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 44-45 (1948). Under some circumstances this Court has even placed the burden of persuasion over an entire claim on the defendant.

2500|$|Thus, {{there is}} <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> ascribe the {{linguistic}} isolation of early Huastecs from other Maya speakers to proto-Olmecs speaking a Mixe–Zoque language, themselves recently arrived after migrating northward from the Soconusco {{region of the}} Pacific coast and across the isthmus of Tehuantepec. There is much stronger evidence that the push for the Huastecs’ further migration up the Gulf coast {{was caused by the}} active presence of the early Olmecs (c. 1400 to 1100 BCE) of San Lorenzo and associated sites. [...] If this is true, most of the distance that the Huastecs migrated during their entire history, from Guatemala to the Huasteca, was traveled in only a century or two at most: the portion between the Olmec heartland around San Lorenzo, and the environs of San Luisa.|$|E
