5|$|The global {{population}} was reduced {{by more than}} 99% during the 20th century. Most of {{this was in the}} Antarctic, which had been reduced to 360 individuals or about 0.15% of their original numbers; other populations were not as badly depleted. The Antarctic blue whale population is growing at the relatively rapid rate of about 7.3% per year, but it was hunted to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> level that it remains at a tiny fraction of pre-whaling numbers. The {{global population}} still requires protection, but it is not in immediate danger of extinction.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Emmy turned {{more to the}} northwest, {{and passed}} about 135miles (220km) {{northeast}} of Barbuda on August 23. The rapid development of an unseasonable frontal low pressure system to the northeast of the storm turned Emmy sharply east-northeastward on August 25. Its eastward movement at <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> latitude for {{the time of year}} was unprecedented. The storm steadily intensified and Emmy attained hurricane status later on the 25th while located 270miles (430km) north of Barbuda. After moving eastward for about 24hours, the Westerlies retreated northward, and Emmy turned gradually to the northwest.|$|E
5|$|When {{vineyards}} in the south-west Cape started letting weeds grow between vines {{to conserve}} moisture, around 1956, the Cape sparrow moved in. Cape sparrows quickly exhausted {{the seeds and}} started eating the grapes. The Cape sparrow is now a serious pest in vineyards. However, vineyards are not optimal habitat: some populations have had <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> reproductive success {{that they could not}} be maintained without immigration.|$|E

5|$|Production {{began on}} 3 August 1943. Many {{details about the}} performances, lighting, camera angles, action, and effects were worked out ahead of {{time in order to}} not only keep the film under budget but also help achieve {{suspense}} on <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> budget. Dr. Jared Criswell, former pastor of the Fifth Avenue Spiritualist Church of New York City, served as a technical consultant on the film regarding psychic phenomena. The picture's final fight scene between the Finn, Pollo, and the mad Captain was shot on a dimly lit set to heighten the suspense and keep the audience from guessing who the victor might be, similar to the way Jacques Tourneur and Lewton had shot a similar scene in Cat People.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. VI {{had a brief}} {{overseas}} career. One of {{the early}} units was experimentally fitted to a Hurricane Mk. IIc, and {{this led to a}} production of a single flight of such designs starting in July 1942. These conversions were given <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> priority that they were not complete until the spring of 1943. Some of these aircraft were sent to Calcutta where they claimed a number of Japanese bombers. An experimental fit on Hawker Typhoon iA R7881 was carried out, with the system packed into a standard underwing drop tank. This was available in March 1943 and underwent lengthy trials lasting into 1944, but nothing came of this work.|$|E

25|$|The series gained {{multiple}} Emmy Award nominations {{during its}} run, but never won. Despite a restricted budget, the show's special effects were superior to contemporary TV shows, its stories were often written by prominent science fiction authors (though often re-written by the show's regular writers), {{and many of}} its production values—such as costuming and set design—were of high caliber for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> budget. Some of the production staff of The Outer Limits worked on Star Trek and often made creative re-use of props from the earlier series.|$|E
25|$|Many {{cases of}} ITP {{can be left}} untreated, and {{spontaneous}} remission (especially in children) is not uncommon. However, counts of under 50,000 are usually monitored with regular blood tests, and those with counts of under 10,000 are usually treated, as the risk of serious spontaneous bleeding is high with <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> platelet count. Any patient experiencing severe bleeding symptoms is also usually treated. The threshold for treating ITP has decreased since the 1990s; hematologists recognize that patients rarely spontaneously bleed with platelet counts greater than 10,000, although there are documented exceptions to this observation.|$|E

25|$|Hogan {{remains the}} only golfer in history to win the Masters, U.S. Open, and British Open in the same {{calendar}} year (1953). His 14-under par at the 1953 Masters set a record that stood for 12 years, and he remains one of just 10 golfers (Jack Nicklaus, Raymond Floyd, Ben Crenshaw, Tiger Woods, David Duval, Phil Mickelson, Charl Schwartzel, Jordan Spieth and Justin Rose) to have recorded <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> score in the tournament. In 1967, at age 54, Hogan shot a record 30 {{on the back nine}} at the Masters; the record stood until 1992.|$|E
25|$|The IMF was {{designed}} to advance credits to countries with balance of payments deficits. Short-run balance of payment difficulties would be overcome by IMF loans, which would facilitate stable currency exchange rates. This flexibility meant a member state {{would not have to}} induce a depression to cut its national income down to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> level that its imports would finally fall within its means. Thus, countries were to be spared the need to resort to the classical medicine of deflating themselves into drastic unemployment when faced with chronic balance of payments deficits. Before the Second World War, European nations—particularly Britain—often resorted to this.|$|E
25|$|Note that brain {{electrical}} activity can stop completely, or drop to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> level {{as to be}} undetectable with most equipment. An EEG will therefore be flat, though this is sometimes also observed during deep anesthesia or cardiac arrest. Although in the United States a flat EEG test {{is not required to}} certify death, it is considered to have confirmatory value. In the UK it is not considered to be of value because any continuing activity it might reveal in parts of the brain above the brain stem is held to be irrelevant to the diagnosis of death on the Code of Practice criteria.|$|E

25|$|The inaugural Division Five tournament {{was held}} in 2008, hosted by Jersey, and {{featured}} 12 teams. For the next four tournaments (2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016), the number of teams has been fixed at six. The 2017 competition will involve eight teams. Because the WCL operates on a system of promotion and relegation, teams have generally only participated {{in one or two}} Division Five tournaments before being either promoted to Division Four or relegated to Division Six. Overall, 21 teams have played in at least one Division Five tournament. Afghanistan and Nepal have progressed from Division Five to the World Cup Qualifier, the only teams to do so from <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> starting division.|$|E
25|$|Wild nine-banded {{armadillos}} (Dayspus novemcinctus) {{in south}} central United States often carry Mycobacterium leprae. This {{is believed to be}} because armadillos have <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> body temperature. Leprosy lesions appear mainly in cooler body regions such as the skin and mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. Because of armadillos' armor, skin lesions are hard to see. Abrasions around the eyes, nose and feet are the most common signs. Infected armadillos make up a large reservoir of M. leprae and may be a source of infection for some humans in the United States or other locations in the armadillos' home range. In armadillo leprosy, lesions did not persist at the site of entry in animals, M. leprae multiplied in macrophages at the site of inoculation and lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of {{metabolic}} {{rates is}} complicated by the distinction between the rates while resting and while active. In all modern reptiles and most mammals and birds the maximum rates during all-out activity are 10 to 20 times higher than minimum rates while at rest. However, in a few mammals these rates differ by a factor of 70. Theoretically it would be possible for a land vertebrate to have a reptilian metabolic rate at rest and a bird-like rate while working flat out. However, an animal with <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> resting rate would be unable to grow quickly. The huge herbivorous sauropods may have been on the move so constantly in search of food that their energy expenditure would have been much the same irrespective of whether their resting metabolic rates were high or low.|$|E
