5000|$|In addition, {{the track}} {{typically}} {{is provided with}} dozens of lower-end ("base model") pace car production replicas (or different makes by the same manufacturer) for use as festival cars throughout the month. Examples of this practice {{date back to the}} mid-1920s. The company who provides the pace car also often provides safety trucks for use at the track. For instance, in 1994, the Ford Mustang Cobra was chosen as the primary pace car. Ford Motor Company provided numerous Mustang GTs (a [...] "stripped-down" [...] model) for festival use. In 1996, the Dodge Viper GTS was chosen as the pace car. Rather than providing a fleet of Vipers, Chrysler provided numerous Stratus, Intrepids, and <b>Special</b> Edition <b>Rams</b> for festival use.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical {{breaching}} can be minimally destructive, {{through the}} use of lock picks. This method is relatively slow and requires a trained operator, but does not damage the lock or door. Using specialized tools (i.e.: A-tool, K-tool), a lock cylinder can also be quickly dismantled and unlocked without removing it from the door; this method also allows the door to be closed and re-locked. Mechanical breaching also includes hydraulic breaching, which uses a <b>special</b> hydraulic <b>ram</b> to overcome the lock. The hydraulic ram may be powered manually, pneumatically, or electrically. More dynamic methods (kinetic breaching) use force to break the lock or door. The common methods are to use a lever, such as a Halligan bar or crowbar, or to use a tool to concentrate a large amount of force on the door, such as a sledgehammer, hydraulic jack, or battering ram.|$|R
50|$|Assuming {{the fourth}} {{register}} {{of the video}} controller sets the background colour of the screen, the CPU can set this colour by writing a value to the memory location A003 using its standard memory write instruction. Using the same method, graphs can be displayed on a screen by writing character values into a <b>special</b> area of <b>RAM</b> within the video controller. Prior to cheap RAM that enabled bit-mapped displays, this character cell method was a popular technique for computer video displays (see Text user interface).|$|R

There was a new connector on board, called ShortBus. It was meant for hardware expansions like LCD displays, 7-segment display, but later also more sophisticated expansions appeared.

5000|$|At UTEP's Pro Day workout, {{in which}} six teams attended, Dorenbos {{averaged}} 0.62 seconds in snapping {{the ball to}} the punter. One snap was timed at 0.59 seconds.

[...] Dorenbos was personally interviewed by only six teams.|$|R
50|$|Other than {{elimination}} of vent windows on hardtop coupes, styling only received minor revisions for 1969, when the Tempest Custom was renamed the Custom S {{for this one}} year. However model offerings {{were the same as}} 1968. A new three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 automatic transmission was introduced and available with all engines {{as an alternative to the}} older two-speed. Engine offerings were the same as before except for the 350 HO V8 engine gaining five-horsepower to 325. A new locking steering column with relocated ignition switch was introduced and front seat headrests became standard equipment. A new GTO option became available, The Judge. Featuring <b>special</b> decals, two <b>Ram</b> Air versions of Pontiac's 400 engine, and a rear spoiler, The Judge was originally conceived as a barebones muscle car based on the Tempest to compete with the new sub-$3,000 Plymouth Roadrunner; however, the plans for a new model fell through and Pontiac division head John DeLorean opted to create a GTO variant instead.|$|R
500|$|The rammerman's {{position}} was of <b>special</b> concern, as <b>ramming</b> {{was considered the}} most dangerous part of loading the gun. The ram was used to first thrust the projectile and then the powder bags into the gun's breech. The ram speed used for the projectile was much faster ( [...] per second) than that used for the lighter powder bags ( [...] per second), {{but there was no}} safety device on the ram piston to prevent the rammerman from accidentally pushing the powder bags at the faster speed. Overramming the powder bags into the gun could subject the highly flammable powder to excessive friction and compression, with a resulting increased danger of premature combustion. Also, if the bags were pushed too far into the gun, a gap between the last bag and the primer might prevent the powder from igniting when the gun was fired, causing a misfire. None of Iowas rammermen had any training or experience in ramming nonstandard five-bag loads into the guns. Complicating the task, as the rammerman was shoving the powder bags, he was also supposed to simultaneously operate a lever to shut the powder hoist door and lower the powder hoist car. Iowa crewmen later stated that Turret Two's center gun rammer would sometimes [...] "take off" [...] uncontrollably on its own at high speed. Furthermore, Backherms had never operated the ram before during a live fire shoot.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the Yale-CMU-Berkeley (YCB) Object and Model set, {{intended}} {{to be used to}} facilitate benchmarking in robotic manipulation, prosthetic design and rehabilitation research. The objects in the set are designed to cover a wide range of aspects of the manipulation problem; it includes objects of daily life with different shapes, sizes, textures, weight and rigidity, as well as some widely used manipulation tests. The associated database provides high-resolution RGBD scans, physical properties, and geometric models of the objects for easy incorporation into manipulation and planning software platforms. In addition to describing the objects and models in the set along with how they were chosen and derived, we provide a framework and a number of example task protocols, laying out how the set can be used to quantitatively evaluate a range of manipulation approaches including planning, learning, mechanical design, control, and many others. A comprehensive literature survey on existing benchmarks and object datasets is also presented and their scope and limitations are discussed. The set will be freely distributed to research groups worldwide at a series of tutorials at robotics conferences, and will be otherwise available at a reasonable purchase cost. It is our hope that the ready availability of this set along with the ground laid in terms of protocol templates will enable the community of manipulation researchers to more easily compare approaches as well as continually evolve benchmarking tests as the field matures.
