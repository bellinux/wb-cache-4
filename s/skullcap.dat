5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the strong room for three weeks wearing a <b>skullcap</b> (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the {{swelling}} in his legs was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the <b>skullcap</b> prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshatana is {{considered}} a gentler form of Shiva's fierce aspect Bhairava and a gentle phase between Bhairava's two gruesome forms, one of which decapitates the god Brahma and the other of which murders the god Vishnu's gatekeeper. Bhikshatana is the form of Bhairava that Shiva assumes to atone for his sin of severing Brahma's fifth head. He wanders the universe {{in the form of}} a naked Kapali mendicant, begging for alms with Brahma's kapala (<b>skullcap)</b> as his begging bowl, until his sin is expiated upon reaching the holy city of Varanasi.|$|E
5|$|Again {{assisted}} by convict laborers and two army sergeants, Dubois began searching along the Solo River near Trinil in August 1891. His team soon excavated a molar (Trinil 1) and a <b>skullcap</b> (Trinil 2). Its characteristics were a long cranium with a sagittal keel and heavy browridge. Dubois first {{gave them the}} name Anthropopithecus ("man-ape"), as the chimpanzee was sometimes known at the time. He chose this name because a similar tooth found in the Siwalik Hills in India in 1878 had been named Anthropopithecus, and because Dubois first assessed the cranium to have been about , closer to apes than to humans.|$|E
50|$|The {{workaholic}} Black died {{one night}} at his office in 1934, {{with one of the}} <b>skullcaps</b> unearthed at the site on his desk. German Jewish anthropologist Franz Weidenreich replaced him as honorary director of the Laboratory and excavations continued uncovering a further three <b>skullcaps</b> in 1936.|$|R

5|$|Von Koenigswald {{also made}} several discoveries in Sangiran, Central Java, where more fossils of early humans were {{discovered}} between 1936 and 1941. Among the discoveries was a <b>skullcap</b> of similar size to that found by Dubois at the Trinil 2 site. Von Koenigswald's discoveries in Sangiran {{convinced him that}} all these skulls belonged to early humans. Dubois again refused to acknowledge the similarity. Ralph von Koenigswald and Franz Weidenreich compared the fossils from Java and Zhoukoudian and concluded that Java Man and Peking Man were closely related. Dubois died in 1940, still refusing to recognize their conclusion, and official reports remain critical of the Sangiran site's poor presentation and interpretation.|$|E
5|$|The Serjeants had {{for many}} centuries {{exclusive}} {{jurisdiction over the}} Court of Common Pleas, being the only lawyers allowed {{to argue a case}} there. At the same time they had rights of audience in the other central common law courts (the Court of King's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas) and precedence over all other lawyers. Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of these courts right up into the 19th century, and socially the Serjeants ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath. Within the Serjeants-at-Law were more distinct orders; the King's Serjeants, particularly favoured Serjeants-at-Law, and within that the King's Premier Serjeant, the Monarch's most favoured Serjeant, and the King's Ancient Serjeant, the oldest. Serjeants (except King's Serjeants) were created by Writ of Summons under the Great Seal of the Realm and wore a special and distinctive dress, the chief feature of which was the coif, a white lawn or silk <b>skullcap,</b> afterwards represented by a round piece of white lace {{at the top of the}} wig.|$|E
25|$|In the Syriac Orthodox Church, married priests wear a black <b>skullcap,</b> or phiro, while monastic priests {{wear the}} schema, eskimo. For certain sacramental functions, a priest or bishop {{puts on the}} epitrachelion (stole).|$|E

25|$|The Kaifeng Jews intermarried {{with local}} Chinese {{sufficiently}} to be indistinguishable in appearance from their non-Jewish neighbors. One trait that differentiated {{them from their}} neighbors was not eating pork. Qu Yinan, a Chinese woman who discovered her Jewish ancestry after her mother attended a conference on minorities in 1981, says her family did not eat pork or shellfish and her grandfather always wore a blue <b>skullcap.</b>|$|E
25|$|Evidently {{the costume}} {{of the poorest}} classes is represented; but as the cord gave no {{protection}} against {{the heat of the}} sun, there is little probability that the custom lasted very long. Much more common was the simple cloth <b>skullcap,</b> dating back to Egyptian times when those of high society routinely shaved their heads, to prevent lice. Conversely, their skullcaps then served as protection against irritation from their wigs.|$|E
25|$|A kippah (Hebrew: כִּפָּה, plural kippot; Yiddish: יאַרמלקע, yarmulke) is a {{slightly}} rounded brimless <b>skullcap</b> worn by many Jews while praying, eating, reciting blessings, or studying Jewish religious texts, and {{at all times}} by some Jewish men. In Orthodox communities, only men wear kippot; in non-Orthodox communities, some women also wear kippot. Kippot {{range in size from}} a small round beanie that covers only {{the back of the head}} to a large, snug cap that covers the whole crown.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{compounds}} in valerian produce {{central nervous system}} depression, {{they should not be}} used with other depressants, such as ethanol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, kava, or antihistamine drugs. Moreover, non-pregnant adult human hepatotoxicity has been associated with short-term use (i.e., a few days to several months) of herbal preparations containing valerian and Scutellaria (commonly called <b>skullcap).</b> Withdrawal after long-term use in a male has also been associated with benzodiazepine-like withdrawal symptoms, resulting in cardiac complications and delirium.|$|E
25|$|A cricket cap {{is a type}} of soft cap, {{often made}} from felt, that is a {{traditional}} form of headwear for players of the game of cricket, regardless of age or gender. It is usually a tight-fitting <b>skullcap,</b> usually made of six or eight sections, with a small crescent shaped brim that points downwards over the brow to provide shade for the eyes. It is often, but not always, elasticised at the rear to hold it in place upon the wearer's head. Sometimes, rather than tight-fitting, the cricket cap comes in a baggy variety, that is always kept in place by elastic.|$|E
25|$|The {{office is}} {{generally}} {{found only in}} older Catholic countries, and is now purely honorific, enjoying no effective powers under canon law —except for the Archbishop of Esztergom (Gran) in Hungary. Thus, e.g., the Primate of Poland holds no jurisdictional authority over other Polish bishops or their dioceses, but is durante munere {{a member of the}} standing committee of the episcopal conference and has honorary precedence among Polish bishops (e.g., in liturgical ceremonies). The Holy See has also granted Polish primates the privilege of wearing cardinal's crimson attire, except for the <b>skullcap</b> and biretta, even if they have not been made cardinals.|$|E

25|$|In 1999 {{researchers}} at Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, Ohio, led by Hunter Peckham, used 64-electrode EEG <b>skullcap</b> to return limited hand movements to quadriplegic Jim Jatich. As Jatich concentrated on simple but opposite concepts like up and down, his beta-rhythm EEG output was analysed using software to identify {{patterns in the}} noise. A basic pattern was identified and used to control a switch: Above average activity was set to on, below average off. As well as enabling Jatich to control a computer cursor the signals were also used to drive the nerve controllers embedded in his hands, restoring some movement.|$|E
25|$|Herbs were {{commonly}} used in salves and drinks to treat a range of maladies. The particular herbs used depended largely on the local culture and often had roots in pre-Christian religion. The success of herbal remedies was often ascribed to their action upon the humours within the body. The use of herbs also drew upon the medieval Christian doctrine of signatures which stated that God had provided some form of alleviation for every ill, and that these things, be they animal, vegetable or mineral, carried a mark or a signature upon them that gave an indication of their usefulness. For example, <b>skullcap</b> seeds (used as a headache remedy) can appear to look like miniature skulls; and the white spotted leaves of lungwort (used for tuberculosis) bear a similarity to the lungs of a diseased patient. A large number of such resemblances were believed to exist.|$|E
25|$|One student {{did find}} some remains: a Dutchman named Eugène Dubois searched the East Indies from 1887 to 1895, {{discovering}} {{the remains of}} Java Man in 1891, consisting of a <b>skullcap,</b> thighbone, and a few teeth. These remains are among the oldest hominid remains ever found. Dubois classified Java Man with Haeckel's Pithecanthropus label, though they were later reclassified as Homo erectus. Some scientists of the day suggested Dubois' Java Man as a potential intermediate form between modern humans and the common ancestor we share with the other great apes. The current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern humans were African populations of Homo erectus (possibly Homo ergaster), rather than the Asian populations exemplified by Java Man and Peking Man. (Ironically, a new human species, Homo floresiensis, a dwarf human type, has recently been discovered in the island of Flores).|$|E
50|$|Religious Zionists {{are often}} called Kippot sruggot, {{referring}} to the knitted or crocheted <b>skullcaps</b> (Hebrew kippa, pl. kippot) worn by the men. However, {{there are also some}} Religious Zionists who wear other types of headcoverings (black velvet kippot, for example).|$|R
50|$|Village after {{village was}} {{forcibly}} converted to Islam. The men {{were forced to}} wear <b>skullcaps</b> and grow beards. The women were stripped of their shankha and sindur and forced to recite the kalma. Moulavis visited their homes and imparted Islamic teachings.|$|R
5000|$|Temple Sinai {{at first}} embraced {{many of the}} customs of [...] "Classical" [...] Reform Judaism that Temple Emanuel did not practice. For example, Sinai members shed {{traditional}} religious garments like Kippot (<b>skullcaps)</b> and Tallitot (prayer shawls), though those customs returned over the years.|$|R
500|$|Dubois's {{complete}} {{collection of}} fossils were transferred between 1895 and 1900 {{to what is}} now known as the Naturalis, in Leiden in the Netherlands. The main fossil of Java Man, the <b>skullcap</b> cataloged as [...] "Trinil 2", has been dated biostratigraphically, that is, by correlating it with a group of fossilized animals (a [...] "faunal assemblage") found nearby on the same geological horizon, which is itself compared with assemblages from other layers and classified chronologically. Ralph von Koenigswald first assigned Java Man to the Trinil Fauna, a faunal assemblage that he composed from several Javanese sites. He concluded that the <b>skullcap</b> was about 700,000 years old, thus dating {{from the beginning of the}} Middle Pleistocene.|$|E
500|$|Louis Witt succeeded Mayersberg in 1927. He {{worked on}} {{fostering}} interfaith relations, and, like his predecessors, {{was active in}} community and civic life. A tall man who sometimes wore a swallow-tail coat when conducting services, he was a strong proponent of [...] "Classical Reform" [...] principles, {{and while he was}} rabbi, following his preference, no one wore a <b>skullcap</b> in the Temple.|$|E
500|$|By all accounts, living {{conditions}} in the common side were horrific. In 1639 prisoners complained that 23women were being held in one room without space to lie down, leading to a revolt, with prisoners pulling down fences and attacking the guards with stones. Prisoners were regularly beaten with a [...] "bull's pizzle" [...] (a whip made from a bull's penis), or tortured with thumbscrews and a <b>skullcap,</b> a vice for the head that weighed [...]|$|E
50|$|Excavations at {{the site}} under the {{supervision}} of Chinese archaeologists Yang Zhongjian, Pei Wenzhong, and Jia Lanpo uncovered 200 human fossils (including six nearly complete <b>skullcaps)</b> from more than 40 individual specimens.

50|$|Of the German’s body, {{embedded}} in the walls, only the skulls survived, {{due to the fact}} that the surface had been deteriorated by the humidity. Most of that <b>skullcaps</b> are smaller than modern men ones, maybe because of the different nutrition and the healthier way of life.|$|R
