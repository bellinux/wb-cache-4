40|$|The {{objectives}} of the Advanced Rotorcraft Transmission program were to achieve a 25 percent weight reduction, a 10 dB noise reduction, and a 5, 000 hour mean time between removals (MTBR). A three engine Army Cargo Aircraft (ACA) of 85, 000 pounds gross weight {{was used as the}} baseline. Preliminary designs were conducted of split path and split torque transmissions to evaluate weight, reliability, and noise. A <b>split</b> path <b>gearbox</b> was determined to be 23 percent lighter, greater than 10 dB quieter, and almost four times more reliable than the baseline two stage planetary design. Detail design studies were conducted of the chosen split path configuration, and drawings were produced of a 1 / 2 size gearbox consisting of a single engine path of the split path section. Fabrication and testing was then conducted on the 1 / 2 size gearbox. The 1 / 2 size gearbox testing proved that the concept of the <b>split</b> path <b>gearbox</b> with high reduction ratio double helical output gear was sound. The improvements were attributed to extensive use of composites, spring clutches, advanced high hot hardness gear steels, the split path configuration itself, high reduction ratio, double helical gearing on the output stage, elastomeric load sharing devices, and elimination of accessory drives...|$|R

40|$|Tests of a 167 Kilowatt (224 Horsepower) <b>split</b> torque face <b>gearbox</b> were {{performed}} by the Boeing Company in Mesa, Arizona, while working under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Technology Reinvestment Program (TRP). This paper provides a summary of these cooperative tests, which were jointly funded by Boeing and DARPA. Design, manufacture and testing of the scaled-power TRP proof-of-concept (POC) <b>split</b> torque <b>gearbox</b> followed preliminary evaluations of the concept performed early in the program. The split torque tests were run using 200 N-m (1767 in-lbs) torque input to {{each side of the}} transmission. During tests, two input pinions were slow rolled while in mesh with the two face gears. Two idler gears were also used in the configuration to recombine torque near the output. Resistance was applied at the output face gear to create the required loading conditions in the gear teeth. A system of weights, pulleys and cables were used in the test rig to provide both the input and output loading. Strain gages applied in the tooth root fillets provided strain indication used to determine torque splitting conditions at the input pinions. The final two pinion-two idler tests indicated 52 % to 48 % average torque split capabilities for the two pinions. During the same tests, a 57 % to 43 % average distribution of the torque being recombined to the upper face gear from the lower face gear was measured between the two idlers. The POC split torque tests demonstrated that face gears can be applied effectively in split torque rotorcraft transmissions, yielding good potential for significant weight, cost and reliability improvements over existing equipment using spiral bevel gearing...|$|R

These gave the engine an additional , to [...] The last 96 SV engines had a <b>split</b> sump. The <b>gearbox</b> now had its lubrication system separate from the engine, which allowed {{the use of the}} appropriate types of oil for the gearbox and the engine. This also alleviated concerns that metal shavings from the gearbox could travel into the engine with disastrous and expensive results and made the application of an optional limited-slip differential far easier.|$|R
2500|$|Hovercraft can be {{powered by}} one or more engines. Small craft, such as the SR.N6, usually have one engine with the drive <b>split</b> through a <b>gearbox.</b> On {{vehicles}} with several engines, one usually drives the fan (or impeller), which is responsible for lifting the vehicle by forcing high pressure air under the craft. The air inflates the [...] "skirt" [...] under the vehicle, causing it to rise above the surface. Additional engines provide thrust in order to propel the craft. Some hovercraft use ducting to allow one engine to perform both tasks by directing some of the air to the skirt, the rest of the air passing out of the back to push the craft forward.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce wind energy costs, prognostics and health {{management}} (PHM) of wind turbine is needed to ensure the reliability and availability of wind turbines. A gearbox {{is an important component}} of a wind turbine. Therefore, developing effective gearbox fault detection tools is important to the PHM of wind turbine. In this paper, a new acoustic emission (AE) sensor based gear fault detection approach is presented. This approach combines a heterodyne based frequency reduction technique with time synchronous average (TSA) and spectrum kurtosis (SK) to process AE sensor signals and extract features as condition indictors for gear fault detection. Heterodyne technique commonly used in communication is first employed to preprocess the AE signals before sampling. By heterodyning, the AE signal frequency is down shifted from several hundred kHz to below 50 kHz. This reduced AE signal sampling rate is comparable to that of vibration signals. The presented approach is validated using seeded gear tooth crack fault tests on a notational <b>split</b> torque <b>gearbox.</b> The approach presented in this paper is physics based and the validation results have showed that it could effectively detect the gear faults...|$|R
40|$|Split torque designs, {{proposed}} as alternatives to traditional planetary designs for helicopter main rotor transmissions, can save weight {{and be more}} reliable than traditional designs. This report {{presents the results of}} an analytical study of the system dynamics and performance of a <b>split</b> torque <b>gearbox</b> that uses a balance beam mechanism for load sharing. The Lagrange method was applied to develop a system of equations of motion. The mathematical model includes time-varying gear mesh stiffness, friction, and manufacturing errors. Cornell's method for calculating the stiffness of spur gear teeth was extended and applied to helical gears. The phenomenon of sidebands spaced at shaft frequencies about gear mesh fundamental frequencies was simulated by modeling total composite gear errors as sinusoid functions. Although the gearbox has symmetric geometry, the loads and motions of the two power paths differ. Friction must be considered to properly evaluate the balance beam mechanism. For the design studied, the balance beam is not an effective device for load sharing unless the coefficient of friction is less than 0. 003. The complete system stiffness as represented by the stiffness matrix used in this analysis must be considered to precisely determine the optimal tooth indexing position...|$|R
50|$|The unit {{itself is}} {{designed}} to independently divert the engine's power to either the axle-facing shaft or the additional PTO output shaft. This is done by two independent clutches like tooth or dog clutches which can be operated at total driveline standstill, only. Since the main gearbox changes the rotation speed by selection of a gear the PTO cannot be operated during driving. The vehicle needs to be stationary for operation therefore.On 4x4 vehicles only the rear drive shaft {{is used by the}} <b>split</b> shaft PTO <b>gearbox</b> requiring the vehicles 4x4 drive scheme to be of the selectable 4WD type to keep the front axle drive shaft completely decoupled during PTO operation.It is also possible to connect something other than a hydraulic pump directly to the PTO for example, fire truck pumps.|$|R
