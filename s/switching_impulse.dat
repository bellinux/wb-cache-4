40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the voltage-source converter (VSC), the demands for HVDC cables have increased significantly. Although more than ten VSC-HVDC projects are under construction and many more are in operations globally, the testing criteria for HVDC XLPE cables are mainly referenced to test guideline TB 496 recommended by CIGRE. Due to the large stray capacitance of the VSC-HVDC cables, the <b>switching</b> <b>impulse</b> overvoltage stress of the cables is the main electrical parameter concerned, a unified overvoltage factor of 2. 1 p. u. being generally accepted. However, the <b>switching</b> <b>impulse</b> overvoltage stress of a VSC-HVDC cable system depends on not only the VSC topology but also the cable parameters and the volt-ampere characteristics of the dc cable surge arresters used. This paper studies the <b>switching</b> <b>impulse</b> overvoltage stresses for the dc cable system of a symmetrical monopole VSC-HVDC transmission system using the modular multilevel converter technology. The studies were performed according to the key technical parameters for a typical 1000 -MW/ 320 -kV VSC-HVDC transmission scheme, the XLPE dc cable links being assumed.

40|$|A recent great {{increase}} in electric power demands {{in large cities}} has been requiring {{a great amount of}} electric power transmission system. 　In such EHV systems, the <b>switching</b> <b>impulse</b> withstand of system insulations is considered more important. Therefore, the knowledge about the performance of system insulations under the switching impulses is most important to the insulation design of the system. Recent studies of the EHV networks have shown that, by suitable means, the switching overvoltage may be limited to below 1. 8 per unit, and eventually down to 1. 5 - 1. 6 per unit. Such limited switching impulses will have a very long wavefront duration time (wavefront 1500 - 5000 μs). 　The knowledge about the performance of the above mentioned <b>switching</b> <b>impulse,</b> however, is not enough. 　In this report, the authors investigated the flashover characteristics and the predischarge phenomena under the above mentioned <b>switching</b> <b>impulse.</b> 　As the result, it is clarified that the flashover voltage values decrease as the rise rate ot the applied voltage increase and the minimum flashover voltage value is lower than that at the power frequency voltage, and, moreover, it is found that the process of the predischarge phenomena, which cause the breakdown of the gaps, is similar to those under the other switching impulses (wavefront 1 O- 1 OOOμs) ...|$|E

40|$|The great {{increase}} of electrical power demand in Japan has been requiring {{a great amount}} of electric power transmission. To cope with that, the power transmission line voltage trends to rise from the extra-high voltage (EHV) to the ultra-high voltage (UHV). 　In UHV transmission systems, the performance of system insulations under switching impulses becomes {{the most important factor in}} the insulation design of the systems because the reduced insulation is adopted in such systems from the economical point of view. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the <b>switching</b> <b>impulse</b> wave-forms for the most adequate insulation design of the UHV transmission systems, and to clarify the <b>switching</b> <b>impulse</b> flashover characteristics. 　As the results, it was clarified that the <b>switching</b> <b>impulse</b> waveforms which occur in the UHV transmission systems vary from 1000 μs to 5000 μs, and moreover, the V-t characteristic curves for positive polarity seem to reach the minimum at about 300 - 500 μs. It has been found from this test that the duration of wave-front at which the flashover voltage reaches the minimum value becomes larger as the gap spacing is longer, and the 50 % flashover voltage curves decrease when the duration of wave-front decreases from 5000 μs to 1800 μs...|$|E

The peak voltages of the constructed devices range from 50  mV to 1000  V. The calibration of impulse voltage measuring equipment is required both by high voltage and quality standards, and the gap between the best measurement accuracy available at National Metrology Institutes; the accuracy that is required in high voltage testing has been very narrow. The only way to improve the situation is to lower the measurement uncertainty levels in the National Metrology Institutes. In this work, the traceability of the peak and time parameter values is based on the modelling of the circuit, and the calculation of these parameters according to network theory. This calculation is based on the calibrated component (resistor and capacitor) values of the impulse circuit. The uncertainty in the peak values is low, as the peak value is not sensitive to changes in the component values of the circuit. The estimated uncertainties for lightning impulse calibrators are 0, 05 % for peak value, 0, 5 % for front time, and 0, 3 % for time to half value.

A metal screen was used to provide simulation of a charged cloud. Measurements of emission current from a Franklin Rod and three configurations of static dissipation devices were conducted in the high voltage laboratory under different environmental conditions. The measurements of emission current were conducted for: no rain or wind, with low and high wind, and with light and heavy rain. The generated <b>switching</b> <b>impulse</b> in this test had a time-to-peak of 250 s and a time-to-half-value of 2000 s, {{both positive and negative}} polarity.

The presented emission current is averaged from three measurements for the same voltage magnitude and polarity of the applied impulse. For each of the three devices, four different levels of voltages were applied from 800 kV to 1100 kV at positive and negative polarity. From the conducted study of the emission current of four lightning protection devices, several conclusions were stated. The study shows emission current is highest for the heavy rain condition.

40|$|Lightning {{damage to}} {{offshore}} wind turbine power plants require an immediate attention, due to its severe damage to wind blade causing outage for a long time. The risk of lightning striking the blade {{is expected to be}} higher when they are located in a highly polluted and humid zone. Sodium chloride (NaCl) is considered to be among the severe pollutant near sea transported through air and gets deposited on the blade surface thereby increasing the surface conductivity of the material. Lightning can strike any part of the blade other than the receptors and the polluted surface with higher conductivity can allow discharge current to propagate over the surface thus causing severe burning of material and damaging the blade. Hence it is necessary to study the influence of salt deposit on a wind turbine blade injected with standard lightning impulse and <b>switching</b> <b>impulse</b> voltages. Wave profile and polarity has an effect during discharge because of its unique discharge formation process. Preliminary experiments are carried out in laboratory to study the influence of salt deposit on a blade sample by adopting IEC 60507 standards.
