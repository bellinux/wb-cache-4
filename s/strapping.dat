5|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of the Devin Townsend Band, Townsend had represented his solo releases live with the <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad lineup; the band would play one set of <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad songs and one set of Devin Townsend songs. After the release of Accelerated Evolution, Townsend began touring with The Devin Townsend Band, at times separately from <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad and at times sharing the bill. After playing two release shows in Vancouver in July 2003, The Devin Townsend Band toured Canada with <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad and Zimmers Hole in October 2003. This was followed by a North American tour with progressive metal band Symphony X through November and December 2003.|$|E
5|$|The final <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad album, The New Black, was {{released}} later in 2006.|$|E
5|$|For {{a period}} of time, <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad also played Townsend's solo {{material}} live. In 1998, {{after the release of}} Infinity, they began performing both <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} a design of an inflatable module including a rigid member disposed in a restraint layer, wherein the restraint layer includes orthogonal <b>straps,</b> includes modeling a <b>strap</b> {{adjacent to the}} rigid member and a <b>strap</b> connected to the rigid member. The adjacent <b>strap</b> and the member <b>strap</b> extend in a first direction. The method further includes selecting a first length of the member <b>strap</b> such that the adjacent <b>strap</b> carries load before the member <b>strap</b> during pressurization of the inflatable module, modeling tensions in the member <b>strap</b> with the first length and the adjacent <b>strap</b> during pressurization of the inflatable model, and outputting the modeled tensions in the member <b>strap</b> with the first length and the adjacent <b>strap.</b> An inflatable module includes a member <b>strap</b> having a length such that an adjacent <b>strap</b> carries load before the member <b>strap</b> during pressurization of the inflatable module...|$|R

5|$|With Infinity, Townsend {{began to}} label all albums outside of <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad {{under his own}} name, {{dropping}} the Ocean Machine moniker, to reduce confusion. He wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects, they are all simply aspects of his identity. The album Biomech was relabeled and redistributed as Ocean Machine: Biomech, under Townsend's name, to reflect the new arrangement. Townsend's bandmates began to play two sets at their shows, one as <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad, and one as the Devin Townsend Band, playing songs from Townsend's solo albums.|$|E
5|$|After {{performing}} {{in a number}} of heavy metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai's album Sex & Religion. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry, and vented his anger on the solo album Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing released under the pseudonym <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed City in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, man, I'm just tired, and old, and bald, and fat, and grouchy, and bored. You know? So I {{was just}} like, I'm going to make this record, and do this stupid Ozzfest thing, and tell a bunch of stupid jokes in front {{of a lot of people}} at Download, then I'm just going to fuck off for a while. The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise <b>Strapping</b> and all these other {{projects}} by doing it for the money. <b>Strapping</b> was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E
30|$|A wide <b>strap</b> design, {{approximately}} 4.5  cm in width, is {{more suitable}} for women with large breasts compared to the standard width (2.5  cm) or a gel <b>strap</b> design for sports bras, {{as evidenced by the}} <b>strap</b> preference and the bra <b>strap</b> pressure data. Participants consistently perceived that the wide <b>straps</b> better cushioned the load borne by the <b>straps,</b> which is logical considering the greater surface area over which to distribute the load generated at the bra strap-shoulder interface. This was also evident in the significantly lower mean static and dynamic mean peak pressure recordings in the wider bra <b>strap</b> conditions compared to the other <b>strap</b> conditions [29]. However, although the wide <b>strap</b> design had the lowest VAS scores, no significant difference was found in <b>strap</b> discomfort among the three <b>strap</b> designs, which may also be attributed to the short durations over which the <b>straps</b> were worn.|$|R
50|$|Two {{common types}} of tie down <b>straps</b> are loop <b>straps</b> and two-piece <b>straps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rings {{are usually}} {{found on the}} {{shoulder}} <b>straps,</b> where they function as a joint. For intimate apparel, the requirement of front <b>strap</b> can be different from back <b>strap.</b> The front <b>strap</b> is more decorative and stretchability {{is less of a}} concern while the back <b>strap</b> is required to have better stability when stretched. Therefore, the two different <b>straps</b> (front and back) and the ring found on intimate apparel are important to join the functions of the bra <b>strap</b> together.|$|R
5|$|Devin Garrett Townsend (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian musician, {{songwriter}} {{and record}} producer. He founded extreme metal band <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad and was its primary songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist in from 1994 to 2007, {{and has an}} extensive career as a solo artist.|$|E
5|$|The band gained {{critical}} {{success and}} a growing underground fan base from their 1997 album City. After a hiatus between 1999 and 2002, the band released three more albums, reaching their commercial peak with the 2006 effort, The New Black. Townsend disbanded <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad in May 2007, announcing his decision to retreat from public view while continuing to record solo albums.|$|E
5|$|Accelerated Evolution {{was written}} and {{recorded}} {{at the same}} time as <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad's self-titled album, with Townsend dividing his energy between the two. Accelerated Evolution was recorded in Vancouver, British Columbia from September to November 2002, and was released on Townsend's independent label, HevyDevy Records, in March 2003. The album was well received by critics for its blend of genres and influences, its musical accessibility, and its large-scale rock production style.|$|E
50|$|A <b>strap</b> lock is {{a device}} that {{prevents}} the guitar <b>strap</b> from slipping off the <b>strap</b> peg. Several companies make these, and players also improvise various devices that fit over {{the part of the}} <b>strap</b> peg that protrudes through the <b>strap</b> end—rubber washers, plastic bag closures, etc.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} bra shoulder <b>strap</b> pressures, to investigate how bra <b>strap</b> cushions moderated this pressure and increased comfort, and {{to investigate the}} effects of variations in bra shoulder <b>strap</b> configuration on vertical breast motion, breast discomfort, shoulder pressures, and comfort. Methods: Fourteen healthy women (C+ bra cup size) ran on a treadmill wearing a sports bra under five <b>strap</b> conditions (no <b>straps,</b> traditional vertical alignment, crossed-back alignment, and with and without bra <b>strap</b> cushions inserted under the <b>straps).</b> Bra shoulder <b>strap</b> pressure, vertical breast displacement, breast pain, and shoulder comfort were measured during each trial. Results: Maximal pressures from 0. 83 to 2. 67 N·cm- 2 and mean pressures from 0. 52 to 1. 06 N·cm- 2 were recorded during running. The bra <b>strap</b> cushions only reduced maximal shoulder <b>strap</b> pressure in the crossed-back <b>strap</b> orientation. Vertical breast displacement was significantly less in the crossed-back orientation compared with no <b>straps,</b> and breast pain was significantly reduced in both the traditional and crossed-back orientation compared with the no <b>strap</b> condition. No significant between-condition difference was found in shoulder comfort regardless of shoulder <b>strap</b> orientation, although the crossed-back <b>strap</b> orientation resulted in significant increases in shoulder force and mean pressure values compared with the traditional <b>strap</b> orientation. Conclusion: The bra shoulder <b>strap</b> cushion was not effective in decreasing the bra shoulder <b>strap</b> pressure due to design flaws that prevented it from adequately increasing the strap–shoulder contact area. However, modifying shoulder <b>strap</b> orientation from a traditional to a crossed-back configuration could alleviate the common problem of bra shoulder <b>straps</b> slipping off {{the shoulders of the}} wearer, without decreasing the overall efficacy of the sports bra in providing breast support...|$|R
40|$|Background Bra <b>straps</b> are {{a primary}} source of {{discomfort}} during sport and exercise, particularly for women with large breasts. This study aimed to investigate the effects of altering bra <b>strap</b> orientation and design on bra <b>strap</b> comfort, pressure and breast support in women with large breasts. This is a descriptive laboratory study. Methods Bra <b>strap</b> discomfort (visual analogue scale, 0 to 10), pressure (custom-designed 10 mm 2 calibrated pressure sensor, 0. 5 to 24 kPa range, 50 Hz, S 2011, Novel GmbH, Munich, Germany, placed under the right bra <b>strap</b> at the crest of each participant 2 ̆ 7 s shoulder), preference ranking and vertical breast displacement (VBD; Optotrak Certus® motion capture system, 200 Hz, Northern Digital, Ontario, Canada) data during dynamic treadmill running and static upright standing (pressure only) were collected for 23 active women with large breasts (D+ cup size) while they wore an encapsulation sports bra with six different bra <b>strap</b> conditions (two bra <b>strap</b> orientations: vertical and cross-back; three bra <b>strap</b> designs: standard width, wide and gel). Results Bra <b>strap</b> discomfort was significantly less (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001) in the vertical compared to the cross-back <b>strap</b> orientation, which was the most preferred orientation despite {{no significant difference in}} <b>strap</b> pressure. The wide <b>strap</b> design had the lowest discomfort scores, significantly lower <b>strap</b> pressure compared to the standard width and gel <b>strap</b> designs (p[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 001), and was equally the most preferred design with the gel <b>straps.</b> There {{was no significant difference in}} VBD among the six <b>strap</b> conditions. Conclusions Bra <b>straps</b> that are vertically orientated and wide (approximately 4. 5 cm in width) are preferable for women with large breasts during sport and exercise to minimise bra <b>strap</b> pressure and discomfort. The addition of gel pads under bra <b>straps</b> may also decrease discomfort and prevent <b>straps</b> slipping off the shoulders, although this notion warrants further investigation...|$|R
5|$|Combining {{elements}} of death metal, thrash metal, black metal, progressive metal and industrial music, <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad's music {{was characterized by}} the use of polyrhythmic guitar riffing and drumming, blast beats and Wall of Sound production. The band's musical direction was mainly determined by Townsend, whose battle with bipolar disorder and dark sense of humour were major influences on his songwriting. Townsend was also noted for his eccentric appearance and on-stage behaviour, which greatly contributed to the band's intense live performances.|$|E
5|$|<b>Strapping</b> Young Lad was a Canadian extreme metal band {{formed by}} Devin Townsend in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1994. The band {{started as a}} one-man studio project; Townsend played most of the {{instruments}} on the 1995 debut album, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing. By 1997, he had recruited permanent members; this line-up, which consisted of Townsend on vocals and guitar, Jed Simon on guitar, Byron Stroud on bass, and Gene Hoglan on drums, lasted until the band's dissolution.|$|E
5|$|Townsend {{wrote and}} {{produced}} the band's first album {{at the same}} time he was working on SYL, spending half the week on one and half on the other. The album was engineered and mixed by Townsend and Shaun Thingvold, who has worked on many of Townsend's and <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad's albums. It had the working title Relationships, but was renamed Accelerated Evolution, a nod to the frantic pace of putting a new band together in under a year.|$|E
50|$|Tie downs, tie <b>straps,</b> cargo <b>straps,</b> E-track <b>straps,</b> {{cargo hoist}} <b>straps,</b> tow ropes, winch <b>straps,</b> cargo nets, {{and dozens of}} other items are used by {{thousands}} of shipping and trucking companies every day. The transportation industry is perhaps the largest user of high strength webbing in the world.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, iam8bit formed another {{partnership}} with Couch Guitar <b>Straps,</b> a vegan-friendly manufacturer of designer guitar <b>straps,</b> {{to create an}} exclusive line of <b>straps</b> created for use with Guitar Hero and Rock Band. Each <b>strap</b> was handmade/sewn in downtown Los Angeles (sweatshop free) and numbered. The <b>straps</b> themselves are also cut slightly shorter than normal guitar <b>straps</b> to more comfortably fit the gaming peripherals.|$|R
50|$|Thin <b>straps</b> {{are used}} as part of {{clothing}} or baggage, or bedding such as a sleeping bag. See for example spaghetti <b>strap,</b> shoulder <b>strap.</b> A <b>strap</b> differs from a belt mainly in that a <b>strap</b> is usually integral to the item of clothing; either {{can be used in}} combination with buckles.|$|R
5|$|Townsend, the founder, songwriter, and {{frontman}} {{of extreme}} metal band <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad and progressive metal group The Devin Townsend Band, dissolved both bands in 2006 {{to spend time}} with his family and avoid the burnout of touring and interviewing. After a period of self-discovery and a year-long break from songwriting, Townsend began work on a four-album series to clarify his identity as a musician. Ki includes themes of self-control and sobriety, and is musically subtler than much of the artist's previous work, consisting of ambient rock music interlaced with tentative bursts of heavy metal.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky's {{first two}} films, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, were low-budget and used montages of {{extremely}} short shots, {{also known as}} hip hop montages. While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts Requiem for a Dream features more than 2,000. Split-screen is used extensively, along with extremely tight closeups. Long tracking shots, including those shot with an apparatus <b>strapping</b> a camera to an actor, called the Snorricam, and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices. Often with his films, Aronofsky alternates between extreme closeups and extreme wide shots {{to create a sense}} of isolation.|$|E
5|$|Modern day native {{groups such}} as the Yurok, Tolowa, Karok, Chilula, and Wiyot all have {{historical}} ties to the region, and some Native American groups still live in the park area today. Archaeological study shows they arrived in the area as far back as 3,000 years ago. An 1852 census determined that the Yurok were the most numerous, with 55 villages and an estimated population of 2,500. They used the abundant redwood, which with its linear grain was easily split into planks, as a building material for boats, houses, and small villages. For buildings, the planks would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions bound with leather <b>strapping</b> and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. Redwood boards were used to form a shallow sloping roof.|$|E
30|$|The lack of {{difference}} in <b>strap</b> pressure in the two <b>strap</b> orientation conditions was {{in contrast to the}} previous study of Bowles and Steele [5] that reported higher <b>strap</b> pressures in cross-back orientated <b>straps</b> compared to vertical <b>straps</b> [5]. The mean peak pressures were of a lower range in the current study compared to those reported by Bowles and Steele [5] (current study 5.7 to 10.6 versus 11.7 to 14.9 kPa) [5], which is likely to be attributed to differences in the measurement devices (current study: one 10  mm 2 sensor versus ten 1  cm 2 sensors positioned in parallel) [5]. Ideally, it would be preferable to have the pressure sensors the same width as the bra <b>strap.</b> However, {{it is also possible that}} pressures in the cross-back orientation measured by Bowles and Steele [5] were falsely high due to overly tight <b>straps.</b> That is, the <b>straps</b> used by Bowles and Steele [5] were commercially available convertible bra <b>straps</b> of a fixed length, which did not allow for the additional length required to traverse the torso in the cross-back orientation. Tighter <b>straps</b> will cause higher <b>strap</b> pressures and more <b>strap</b> discomfort. An objective measure of <b>strap</b> tension would provide further insight into the <b>strap</b> pressure/discomfort relationship and is a suggested area of study for future research. Irrespective {{of difference}}s in <b>strap</b> tension, it is imperative that both bra manufacturers and consumers ensure that the <b>strap</b> length is sufficient for bras with a cross-back <b>strap</b> orientation, taking into consideration the wide range of women’s torso morphology.|$|R
50|$|To {{prevent the}} helmet <b>straps</b> from {{impairing}} the drivers vision, {{there is a}} design where the <b>straps</b> are held horizontal to prevent the <b>straps</b> from sagging. There are also designs in which no apparatus is needed to keep <b>straps</b> out of the drivers sight. Helmet <b>straps</b> {{are made up of}} shock absorbing material used while climbing or for security when working at high elevations. The <b>straps</b> include a woven nylon that requires up to 475 lbs. of force to cause the <b>straps</b> to tear. <b>Straps</b> that are stretchable allow the drivers brain to slow down to avoid brain damage caused from the brain slamming into the skull; but the <b>straps</b> do not let the head move too far forward to cause neck injuries.|$|R
5000|$|A guitar <b>strap</b> is a {{strip of}} {{material}} with an attachment mechanism on each end, made to hold a guitar via the shoulders at an adjustable length. Guitars have varying accommodations for attaching a <b>strap.</b> The most common are <b>strap</b> buttons, also called <b>strap</b> pins, which are flanged steel posts anchored to the guitar with screws. Two <b>strap</b> buttons come pre-attached to virtually all electric guitars, and many steel-string acoustic guitars. <b>Strap</b> buttons are sometimes replaced with [...] "strap locks", which connect the guitar to the <b>strap</b> more securely.|$|R
5|$|Townsend {{remained}} productive between 1999 and 2002, recording {{two more}} solo albums, Physicist in 2000 and Terria in 2001, and producing albums for Zimmers Hole, Stuck Mojo and Soilwork, among others. Although <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad was officially on hiatus, they gave occasional live performances, including {{an appearance on}} the Foot In Mouth Tour in 2001 with Fear Factory. During this period, Townsend's bandmates were active musically; both Stroud and Hoglan recorded with other bands, and all three were involved in Townsend's solo efforts as studio musicians {{and as part of}} his live band as well. Hoglan and Simon also formed a side project called Tenet with Grip Inc. bassist Stuart Carruthers and Interzone frontman Rob Urbinati in early 2002.|$|E
5|$|Townsend's solo albums, {{a diverse}} mix of hard rock, {{progressive}} metal, ambient, and new-age, have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians. In 2002 he formed the Devin Townsend Band, a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured {{for two of}} his solo releases. In 2007, he disbanded both <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad and the Devin Townsend Band, {{taking a break from}} touring {{to spend more time with}} his family. After a two-year hiatus, he began recording again, and soon announced the formation of the Devin Townsend Project. The project began with a series of four albums, released from 2009 to 2011, each written in a different style, and Townsend continues to record and tour under the new moniker.|$|E
5|$|When Dyer {{returned}} to Europe he initially travelled to France, where he sang and played to theatres in Paris. Only one boxing match is recorded {{during his time}} there, against middleweight Jean Audouy. Before the fight Dyer was advised by a doctor not to wear his <b>strapping</b> he had used to support his injured left leg, but in the seventh round his leg gave way again and Audouy was declared the winner. Just a week before his encounter with Audouy, Ted Lewis had regained his British middleweight title but Dyer's reoccurring injury now ruled out any encounter between the fighters.|$|E
40|$|The <b>STRAP</b> V {{system was}} {{developed}} to provide higher accuracy and lower limit cycle fine pointing (+ or - 7 arcseconds) in all three axes at targets which cannot be tracked by startrackers or solar trackers. The system provides an increase in pointing performance over that obtainable with the <b>STRAP</b> IV (1) Attitude Control System (ACS). The <b>STRAP</b> IV concept of third axis updates is utilized to reduce pointing errors, using the flight-proven <b>STRAP</b> III (2) system as a first stage. Flight aspect photographs and telemetry records show that the <b>STRAP</b> V objectives have been met. The <b>STRAP</b> IV major error contributors have been significantly reduced and the tracking flexibility has been increased with only minor error contributions. Attention {{is given to the}} basic <b>STRAP</b> III control modes, major <b>STRAP</b> IV system error sources, tuned restrained inertial gyros (TRIGs), the programmable sequence timer, the <b>STRAP</b> V control box, third axis update, system gyro alignments, and <b>STRAP</b> V operational capabilities...|$|R
50|$|<b>Straps</b> from vinyl {{manufacturers}} are normally supplied in rolls, {{which can be}} cut into individual <b>straps</b> of any desired length. However, some furniture manufacturers or retailers may sell individual and cut-to-fit <b>straps.</b> The most common <b>strap</b> sizes are 1.5 and 2 inches wide.|$|R
50|$|Tie down <b>straps</b> (also called ratchet <b>straps,</b> lashing <b>straps</b> or tie downs) are {{fasteners}} used to {{hold down}} cargo or equipment during transport. Tie down <b>straps</b> are essentially webbing that is outfitted with tie down hardware.
