5|$|A young Addie (Katelyn Reed) <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> {{at an old}} mansion {{when two}} {{troublesome}} twins Brian and Troy (Kai and Bodhi Schulz) arrive, planning to enter the house. Addie warns them not to enter the house, but they ignore her warning and enter the house anyway. While they wreak havoc, Brian discovers a dying animal and the twins find an open door to the basement. They enter the basement where they find jars containing animal remains and human fetuses. After complaining about the smell, Brian leaves the basement {{only to find that}} his brother has gone silent. He searches for him and finds him with his throat slit, gasping for air. The Infantata (Ben Woolf) appears behind him and kills him off screen.|$|E

60|$|The younger seaman was, in all outward appearance, the {{converse}} of his companion. His stature {{could not have}} exceeded four feet. A pair of stumpy bow-legs supported his squat, unwieldy figure, while his unusually short and thick arms, with no ordinary fists at their extremities, swung off dangling from his sides like the fins of a sea-turtle. Small eyes, of no particular color, twinkled far back in his head. His nose remained buried in the mass of flesh which enveloped his round, full, and purple face; and his thick upper-lip rested upon the still thicker one beneath {{with an air of}} complacent self-satisfaction, much heightened by the owner's habit of licking them at intervals. He evidently regarded his tall shipmate with a feeling half-wondrous, half-quizzical; and stared up occasionally in his face as the red setting sun <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> at the crags of Ben Nevis.|$|E
60|$|Dawes <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> at {{the picture}} with a caustic {{expression}} on his face.|$|R

6000|$|... "'How dreadful ill {{and weak}} she do look, don't she?' says Emmy. Before I could say {{as much as}} 'Yes,' she <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> at us, and asks in a wild voice, though it wasn't very loud either, if we can tell her the way to Bangbury workhouse. Having pretty sharp eyes of our own, we both of us knew that a workhouse was no fit place for her. Her gown was very dusty, {{and one of her}} boots was burst, and her hair was draggled all over her face, and her eyes was sunk in her head, like; but we saw somehow that she was a lady--or, if she wasn't exactly a lady, that no workhouse was proper for her, at any rate. I stooped down to speak to her; but her baby was crying so dreadful she could hardly hear me. 'Is the poor thing ill?' says I. 'Starving,' says she, in such a desperate, fierce way, that it gave me a turn. 'Is that your child?' says I, a bit frightened about how she'd answer me. 'Yes,' she says in quite a new voice, very soft and sorrowful, and bending her face away from me over the child. 'Then why don't you suckle it?' says I. She looks up at me, and then at Jenny and shakes her head, and says nothing. I give my baby to Jemmy to hold, and went and sat down by her. He walked away a little; and I whispered to her again, 'Why don't you suckle it?' and she whispered to me, 'My milk's all dried up. I couldn't wait to hear no more till I'd got her baby at my own breast.|$|E

50|$|An unnamed {{woman and}} her {{guardian}} are standing {{on the surface of}} a Pattern Juggler planet which is being evacuated. The woman agrees with her guardian to spend one more hour before returning to their ship. She <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> towards the stars and has the machinery in her clothing magnify one of them, revealing it to be colored green.|$|E

50|$|Next, Arthur “rescues” Eliza from boredom {{by placing}} her with Mrs. Fielding. This accomplished, Arthur can finally {{concentrate}} on his apprenticeship, {{but he quickly}} realizes {{that he is in}} love with Mrs. Fielding. This comes as such a shock to him that he actually goes out to the house in the country where Mrs. Fielding is staying and <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> at her window at night. She is frightened, recognizes him, and tells him to see her in the city. The next day they finally admit their feelings to each other and agree to marry.|$|E

50|$|Once {{the tender}} has floated some {{distance}} from the yacht, Josh pulls his hunting knife from his shorts and points it at Tammi. He demands the incriminating tape from Tammi and, fearing for her life, she obliges, throwing it {{on the floor of the}} tender. As a distracted Josh reaches for the tape, Tammi quickly throws the looped end of the mooring rope around his neck. The rope immediately reaches the end of its tether and Josh is wrenched into the sea, snapping his neck and killing him. Tammi, now the sole survivor, fires a distress flare in the hope of being rescued. She then lies down on the tender and morbidly <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> at the night sky, as the raft drifts away into the ocean.|$|E

50|$|Driven by buggy {{operator}} Ben Hussey (Martin Vaughan), {{the party}} pass through and {{arrive at the}} Rock by mid-afternoon. After a meal, Mr. Hussey notes his watch has stopped at the stroke of twelve, as has the watch of Miss McCraw. With permission from Mlle. de Poitiers, Miranda, Marion and Irma decide to explore Hanging Rock and take measurements, with Edith allowed to follow. The group is observed several minutes later by a young Englishman, Michael Fitzhubert (Dominic Guard), who is lunching at the Rock with his uncle Colonel Fitzhubert (Peter Collingwood), aunt Mrs. Fitzhubert (Olga Dickie), and valet Albert (John Jarratt). At the top of Hanging Rock, the group lies on the ground, apparently dazed by the sun. Miss McCraw, still {{at the base of}} the Rock, <b>stares</b> <b>up.</b> Miranda, Marion, and Irma awake and move, as if in a trance, into a recess in the rock face. Edith screams and flees down the Rock.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{opens with}} a {{childhood}} [...] "abduction" [...] scene, later a memory that the main character (Eric Rainer) flashes back to. Then we encounter adult Eric {{in the midst of}} a panic attack: He stumbles outside and <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> at a [...] "Darkening Sky", the stars gradually, impossibly blinking out. When a neighbor (Harold) interrupts and snaps him out of it, Eric cuts the conversation short and goes back inside, where his girlfriend (Lisa) announces that she is tired of his obsession with Alien Abduction—Eric is laboring on a thesis dismissing UFOs as a [...] "modern mythology"—and she breaks up with him. This tips Eric into a removed state of mind; as he focuses on her lips moving, everything fades to silence. Next we encounter Eric returning from a late-night jog. He falls asleep on the sofa and has a nightmare of alien abduction, climaxing with a vision of a strange creature carrying Lisa away.|$|E
50|$|The catastrophic {{crash landing}} of a Federation {{spacecraft}} on an uncharted planet made up entirely of sand leaves crewman Grimes dead, while Rand and Shapiro survive. Rand stares {{out over the}} sand dunes and both men associate the endless rolling dunes with a beach. Rand is becoming hypnotized by the dunes and refuses {{to move from the}} dune he is standing on or drink water. Shapiro also feels drawn to the dunes but, unlike Rand, finds this hypnosis frightening and is relieved to go inside the ship where the dunes are out of sight. When a trader spacecraft arrives in response to Shapiro's beacon, the trader's crew initially treat Shapiro's account of events with skepticism but become convinced when they are unable to get Rand away from the dunes. Rand resists leaving the planet, and the sand reveals itself to be sentient. It prevents Rand's rescue by damaging a sampler android sent from the ship and sending a hand of sand up to stop a tranquilizer dart. The rescue ship escapes just in time, with Shapiro and the trader's captain both narrowly avoiding a giant hand of sand. Rand, left alone, <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> at the ship as it disappears, and then begins to pile handfuls of sand into his mouth.|$|E
60|$|At that {{he laughed}} in good earnest, and slapped his breech-clouts repeatedly. All {{at once he}} stopped, and <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> the ridge.|$|R
60|$|He {{pushed his}} chair back and, rising slowly from the table, confronted him. Captain Brisket, red-faced and confident, <b>stared</b> <b>up</b> at him composedly.|$|R

50|$|Marfa, Texas. Cas and Bobby are at Hotel Paisano to meet Deakin. When he {{does not}} appear they ask the manager, Kirby, {{to take them to}} Deakin’s room, and they find it full of smoke. At this moment a few clips from the Orb disturb the narrative. The Viking 1 lands on Mars in 1976; Pickett's Charge happens in 1863; two {{children}} in a cave centuries ago paint their facesand then die; in Clip #1 Toland’s daughter Audra drowns in 1962; a baby named Alvin Alex Anderson <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> above his crib. The uncertainty of the Orb resembles the smoke in Deakin’s room. Cas thinks about these clips and how she had found Audra’s body. Then she thinks of how Bobby always manages to put out fires and remembers a close encounter with a cop in their Airstream trailer. She thinks of Deakin’s Parcel Thoughts profile, where he had posted updates about everyone: Thanatos, Thaumaturge, Artemis, and Treebeard dead; Pythia, Endoria, and Lilith arrested; Circe and Sibyll missing. Bobby also discovered that their friend Realic S. Tarnen had been tortured and cut into pieces in Los Angeles. Sorcerer had still sent no word of his whereabouts, so he might have died too. Back in the hotel, Cas and Bobby walk in behind Kirby to find it empty. In the bathtub Deakin’s Orb is blown to bits. They leave soon after and return to their RV. At the close of the chapter it is revealed that the girl in Clip #6 is Xanther. Cas knows this because Sorcerer knows both Xanther and Anwar.|$|E

40|$|This article {{begins with}} an {{overview}} of music technology today, its history and current status. The development of MIDI, digital sound synthesis, and CD audio are mentioned. Developments in music software designed assisted instruction are placed in six categories: drill-and-practice, flexible practice, guided instruction, games, exploratory, and creative. The article continues by offering examples of commercial software from these categories that are appropriate for young children. Screen shots of each program are offered, together with comments about how each title works. Research on the young child and music technology is included, with references to work done in and outside of music education. The article ends {{with the notion that}} teachers are always the key to quality instruction in music and music technology is only a tool in the process. s I write these words, the year-ending holiday season is upon us and television commercials about the wonders of technology abound. My favorite one features a JL young girl seated in front of a modern personal computer. She seems to be doing a report for school on a music topic as she <b>stares</b> <b>up</b> at a colorful screen of jazz musician...|$|E
