5|$|Hurricane Ignacio was the latest-forming first {{hurricane}} of a Pacific {{hurricane season}} since reliable <b>satellite</b> <b>observation</b> began in 1966. The ninth tropical storm of the 2003 Pacific hurricane season, Ignacio developed {{out of a}} tropical wave on August 22 a short distance {{off the coast of}} Mexico. It was initially predicted to track out to sea and remain a weak tropical storm, though it unexpectedly organized rapidly to attain peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) on August 24 while located a short distance southeast of southern Baja California. Land interaction weakened Ignacio to an 80mph (130km/h) hurricane by the time it made landfall near La Paz, and it dissipated on August 27 in the central region of the Baja California peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression moved slowly northwestward, with the slow motion persisting for its entire lifetime {{due to the}} storm being embedded within the weakness of a mid-level ridge to its north. Shortly after forming, the storm was located in a marginally favorable environment, with westerly wind shear and dry air approaching the depression and leaving the center of circulation exposed from the convection. However, the wind shear subsequently decreased, and early on August 23 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ignacio. The storm quickly organized and developed well-defined banding features and very well-organized upper-level outflow, and by late on August 23 a warm spot formed {{in the center of}} the convection. The warm spot organized into an intermittent eye feature. Early on August 24, Ignacio attained hurricane status, the latest formation of the first hurricane of a season recorded in the East Pacific since reliable <b>satellite</b> <b>observation</b> began in 1966.|$|E

Ava is now the fifth-most intense, tied with Hurricane Ioke, as hurricanes Patricia, Linda, Rick and Kenna recorded lower pressures. However, Linda's and Rick's pressures were only estimated from satellite imagery, so Ava held the record for lowest measured pressure until Kenna surpassed it in 2002. However, the meteorological record for the eastern north Pacific are unreliable because geostationary <b>satellite</b> <b>observation</b> did not begin until 1966.

30|$|Conventional spherical {{harmonic}} modeling needs full data {{coverage of}} the Earth that only <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> may provide with a relatively uniform error budget. <b>Satellite</b> <b>observations</b> essentially recover longer-wavelength anomaly features, but not the higher-frequency anomalies near the Earth’s surface due to the measurement errors (e.g., Kim et al. 2004; von Frese et al. 2005).

40|$|Numerical weather {{prediction}} relies on data assimilation {{to estimate the}} current state of the atmosphere. Generally speaking, data assimilation methods combine information from observations and from a prior forecast state, taking into account their respective uncertainties. Ensemble-based data assimilation schemes estimate the forecast uncertainty with the sample covariance from an ensemble of forecasts. While these schemes have been shown to successfully assimilate conventional observations of model state variables, they have only recently begun to assimilate <b>satellite</b> <b>observations.</b> This dissertation explores some of the complications that arise when ensemble-based schemes assimilate <b>satellite</b> <b>observations.</b> Although ensemble data assimilation schemes often assume that observations are taken at the time of assimilation, <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> are available almost continuously between consecutive assimilation times. In Chapter 2, we formulate a ``four-dimensional'' extension to ensemble-based schemes that is analogous to the operationally used scheme 4 D-VAR. Using perfect model experiments with the Lorenz- 96 model, we find that the four-dimensional ensemble scheme can perform comparably to 4 D-VAR. Many ensemble data assimilation schemes utilize spatial localization so that a small ensemble can capture the unstable degrees of freedom in the model state. These local ensemble-based schemes typically allow the analysis at a given location to depend only on observations near that location. Meanwhile, the location of <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> cannot be pinpointed in the same manner as conventional observations. In Chapter 3, we propose a technique to update the state at a given location by assimilating <b>satellite</b> radiance <b>observations</b> that are strongly correlated to the model state there. For satellite retrievals, we propose incorporating the observation error covariance matrix and selecting the retrievals that have errors correlated to observations near the location to be updated. Our selection techniques improve the analysis obtained when assimilating simulated <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> with a seven-layer primitive equation model, the SPEEDY model. Finally, <b>satellite</b> radiance <b>observations</b> are subject to state-dependent, systematic errors due to errors in the radiative transfer model used as the observation operator. In Chapter 4 we propose applying state-space augmentation to ensemble based assimilation schemes to estimate satellite radiance biases during the data assimilation procedure. Our approach successfully corrects such systematic errors in simulated biased <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> with the SPEEDY model...|$|R
