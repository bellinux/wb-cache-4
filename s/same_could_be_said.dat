5|$|Clark's {{relationships}} with the other characters evolved {{over the course of}} the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a yin and yang type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; the <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
25|$|The Celestial Masters' {{activities}} did {{hasten the}} downfall of the Han Dynasty, largely because Zhang's grandson set up a theocratic state into what is now Sichuan province.

50|$|Later in the year, Starr was {{released}} and soon re-joined ROH, whilst Shelley and Sabin introduced The Motor City Machine Guns to TNA. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> the Paparazzis had officially broken up as of April 26, therefore the <b>same</b> date <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to <b>be</b> {{the end of}} Generation Next's association in TNA.|$|R

He liked Rachel straight away, but the <b>same</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for her initially. They later slept together when Jack replaced Frank for two weeks.|$|R
25|$|Some have {{questioned}} {{the ability of the}} federal government to achieve greater savings than the largest PDPs, since some of the larger plans have coverage pools comparable to Medicare’s, though the evidence from the VHA is promising. Some also worry that controlling the prices of prescription drugs would reduce incentives for manufacturers to invest in R, though the <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of anything that would reduce costs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for Lillywhite’s team which, being {{selected}} from only four counties, meant {{that some of}} England’s best players did not take part. In addition, the team had a rough voyage back across the Tasman Sea and many members had been seasick. The game was due to be played on 15 March, the day after their arrival, but most had not yet fully recovered. On top of that, wicket-keeper Ted Pooley was still in a New Zealand prison after a brawl in a Christchurch pub.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, Manchester gained a {{pioneering}} reputation {{for a city}} at the centre of physics, namely {{in the field of}} nuclear physics. The 'Nuclear Family' was the alias given to a group of scientists who studied nuclear physics in Manchester. 'Family' highlights the consistent development through the generations in nuclear physics, beginning with Thomson in the late 18th century and ending with James Chadwick in the 1930s who discovered the neutron. Ernest Rutherford is often described as the 'father of nuclear physics', equally the <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of J. J. Thomson who discovered the electron and isotopes, and ultimately taught Rutherford who later go on to split the atom. Scientists who were part of the 'nuclear family' in Manchester included J. J. Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, Niels Bohr, Hans Geiger, Ernest Marsden, John Cockcroft and James Chadwick.|$|E

500|$|On mixed review, Andy Gill of The Independent, while {{describing}} Mars' [...] "impassioned shame" [...] on {{the lyrics}} called the track [...] "enjoyable". The lyrics {{have not gone}} undecided for PopMatters Matt Cibula who named them a [...] "classic lament" [...] and added [...] "is as widescreen and wide-open as things get these days". The <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for Jason Lipshut who, while writing for Billboard, found Mars' [...] "recognizing sin while indulging in it" [...] on the [...] "sleek" [...] lyrics and composition. However, a [...] "throwback vibe (established from the backing vocals) remain from Doo-Wops", while prospecting the earnest from [...] "It Will Rain". On the other hand, Pastes Ryan Reed criticized Mars' for playing safe on [...] "Young Girls", unlike {{most of the other}} tracks on the album. He explained that the singer [...] "steps sideways" [...] and the record [...] "is a 'shout-out-to-the-honeys' belter" [...] for various reasons. In 2013, [...] "Young Girls" [...] received an award at the MelOn Music Awards for the category [...] "Best Pop".|$|E
500|$|In 1921 Wilkinson {{attended}} the Red International of Labour Unions Congress and the Second Congress of Communist Women in Moscow, {{where she met}} several Russian communist leaders, including the Defence Minister Leon Trotsky, and Nadezhda Krupskaya, the educationist who was Lenin's wife; Wilkinson considered Krupskaya's speech the best at the Congress. The main outcome of the gathering was {{the foundation of the}} Red International of Labour Unions, often known as the [...] "Profintern". The aim of this organisation was to seek revolutionary change through industrial action, leading to the overthrow of world capitalism. At home, although she failed to persuade her union, NUDAW, to affiliate to the Profintern, Wilkinson continued to promote Russian achievements, especially its emancipation of women workers. In November 1922, at a meeting celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Russian Revolution, Wilkinson said that the Russian people could look forward with hope, and asked whether the <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of the people condemned to live their lives in the slums of Manchester. However, Wilkinson found herself increasingly at odds with communists in Manchester, over the party's industrial and wider international strategies.|$|E

[...] Justin Chang of Variety extolled the film as [...] "a wildly creative fantasia...a brilliant, maddening, ingeniously designed and monstrously self-aggrandizing movie." [...] Sasha Stone, writing for TheWrap, stated that Fassbender gives [...] "a stunning knockout" [...] performance as Jobs in a film that is [...] "a kind of talk opera", which to some might seem to be [...] "Sorkin overkill but the <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for the best of them: David Mamet, Edward Albee, Paddy Chayefsky and even William Shakespeare. Sorkin is not trying to do anything but write in his own style, thus this film and its exceptional dialogue leaves its mark as profoundly as Jobs himself left his." [...] Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a [...] "B+", stating that [...] "the cast vanishes into their parts...buried under makeup and a distinctive Polish accent, Winslet's chameleonesque transformation is bested only by Fassbender, whose vivid expressions and constant movement turn him into a physical marvel." [...] He also noted that Boyle [...] "drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{neighbouring}} town of Blackwater, [...] to {{the west}} is also considered {{by some to be}} a suburb of Camberley, although it is in the Hart District of Hampshire and has its own town council (together with Hawley). The <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for Sandhurst which is home of [...] "The Meadows" [...] retail park which is in the Bracknell Forest borough of Berkshire. [...] The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst is located in Camberley, despite the name suggesting otherwise.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were also}} those who feared {{the school would}} not be Russian enough. [...] Rubinstein drew a {{tremendous}} amount of criticism from the Russian nationalist music group known as The Five. [...] Mikhail Zetlin, in his book on The Five, writes, The very idea of a conservatory implied, it is true, a spirit of academism which could easily turn it into a stronghold of routine, but then the <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of conservatories all over the world. [...] Actually the Conservatory did raise the level of musical culture in Russia.

25|$|The works not {{assigned}} {{as a part}} of Cassiodorus's {{educational program}} must be examined critically.

25|$|The Ottoman Empire {{ruled in}} {{accordance}} to Islamic law. As such, the People of the Book (the Christians and the Jews) had to pay an extra tax to fulfil their status as dhimmi and in return were guaranteed religious autonomy.

2500|$|In England it was {{so common}} that [...] today one finds [...] "Renaissance Italian Palazzi" [...] serving as banks or {{municipal}} buildings in the centres of even the smallest towns. It has been said [...] "It is a well-known fact that the nineteenth century had no art style of its own." [...] While to an extent this may be true, the <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of most eras until the early 20th century, the Neo-Renaissance {{in the hands of}} provincial architects did develop into a style not always instantly recognisable as a derivative of the Renaissance. In this less obvious guise the Neo-Renaissance was to provide an important undercurrent in totalitarian architecture of various countries, notably in Stalinist architecture of the Soviet Union, as seen in some pavilions of the All-Soviet Exhibition Centre.|$|E
2500|$|Glazunov's musical {{development}} was paradoxical. He was adopted as an idol by nationalist composers {{who had been}} largely self-taught and, apart from Rimsky-Korsakov, were deeply distrustful of academic technique. Glazunov's first two symphonies {{could be seen as}} an anthology of nationalist techniques as practiced by Balakirev and Borodin; the <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for his symphonic poem Stenka Razin with its use of the folk song [...] "Volga Boatmen" [...] and orientalist practices much like those employed by The Five. By his early 20s he realized the polemic battles between academicism and nationalism were no longer valid. Although he based his compositions on Russian popular music, Glazunov's technical mastery allowed him to write in a sophisticated, cultured idiom. With his Third Symphony, he consciously attempted to internationalize his music {{in a manner similar to}} Tchaikovsky, to whom the piece is dedicated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fact that}} Scappaticci's would {{eventually}} {{be replaced by the}} Raj Indian restaurant (i) is indicative of the post war influx of Asian immigrants to Scotland and the popularity of their food with the local population. The <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for the presence of Henderson Street's Chinese restaurant, Golden Bridge (vii). More recently, one of Henderson Street's oldest bars, The Bay Horse (located at number 6365 and in operation as a spirit merchant since 1897) has succumbed to this international influence. Early photographic records show The Bay Horse circa 1910. Its proprietor, at that time, was a Charles G. Lane, who had been in possession of the pub since 1902. In the 1990s, the bar became Kalinka's (ix), a vodka bar operated by a Russian Countess [...] and since 2005, the pub has once again been reincarnated as Sofi's (vi), now with a Swedish theme and Swedish owners.|$|E

The <b>same</b> thing <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of boredom. The parallel is certainly no coincidence. Time and boredom are two closely related phenomen...|$|R
50|$|At Damietta, the Byzantine-Crusader {{alliance}} materialized into a {{siege of}} the port. The Crusaders attacked late while the Byzantines, {{after three months}} abandoned the siege.

It was found that a chance trader to Godhaab had brought a considerable quantity of rum, and the families of which we now speak had secured several kegs.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{era when}} {{scientists}} did not travel so frequently as today, Huxley was an exception, for he travelled widely in Europe, Africa and the United States. He was therefore able to learn from and influence other scientists, naturalists and administrators. In the US {{he was able to}} meet other evolutionists at a critical time in the reassessment of natural selection. In Africa he was able to influence colonial administrators about education and wild-life conservation. In Europe, through UNESCO, he was at the centre of the post-World War II revival of education. In Russia, however, his experiences were mixed. His initially favourable view was changed by his growing awareness of Stalin's murderous repression, and the Lysenko affair. There seems little evidence that he had any effect on the Soviet Union, and the <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for some other Western scientists."Marxist-Leninism had become a dogmatic religion… and like all dogmatic religions, it had turned from reform to persecution." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nearly all of Vysotsky's {{songs are}} in the first person, {{although}} he is almost never the narrator. When singing his criminal songs, he would adopt the accent and intonation of a Moscow thief, and when singing war songs, he would sing {{from the point of}} view of a soldier. In many of his philosophical songs, he adopted the role of inanimate objects. This created some confusion about Vysotsky's background, especially during the early years when information could not be passed around very easily. Using his acting talent, the poet played his role so well that until told otherwise, many of his fans believed that he was, indeed, a criminal or war veteran. Vysotsky's father said that [...] "War veterans thought the author of the songs to be one of them, as if he had participated in the war together with them." [...] The <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> about mountain climbers; on multiple occasions, Vysotsky was sent pictures of mountain climbers' graves with quotes from his lyrics etched on the tombstones.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{source of}} the first duel is the Kaijo Monogatari. The entry in the Kaijo Monogatari {{was written in the}} 17th century but the exact year is debated. Author Kenji Tokitsu dates the Kaijo to 1666, but author Wayne Muromoto [...] give the date of 1629. Another source is the Honcho Bugei Shoden (or Honcho Bugei Koden) written in about 1716. The sources agree on the core of the story however; that Gonnosuke faced Musashi and was defeated, after which he retreated and formed his jo-techniques. The notion that Musashi was defeated in a rematch can be argued to have been a later construct by later pro-Gonnosuke historians, as there is no mentioning of a defeat in the sources regarding Musashi. The <b>same</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said,</b> however, for Musashi's followers who might have removed all mentioning of Musashi's defeat as a way to preserve his reputation. Another mentioning of the first duel is found in the Niten-Ki which was compiled by Musashi's followers years after his death. There is only one known source mentioning the rematch. It is a scroll now preserved in Tsukuba Shrine in Ibaraki prefecture, although doubts of its contents has been raised, partially because there are no other known corroborating sources to confirm it.|$|E

30|$|The {{lower level}} of human and {{physical}} capital also seems linked to a technology gap between Argentina and many other western countries, {{at the turn of}} the last century.
