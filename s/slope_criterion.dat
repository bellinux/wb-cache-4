40|$|A fast {{rate-distortion}} (R-D) optimized wavelet packet (WP) transform {{is proposed}} for image compression in this research.

40|$|Conventional wisdom among {{environmental}} economists is {{that the}} relative slopes of the marginal social benefit and marginal social cost functions determine whether a price-based or quantity-based environmental regulation leads to higher expected social welfare. We revisit the choice between price-based vs. quantity-based environmental regulation under Knightian uncertainty; that is, when uncertainty cannot be modeled with known probability distributions. Under these circumstances, the policy objective cannot be to maximize the expected net benefits of emissions control. Instead, we evaluate an emissions tax and an aggregate abatement standard in terms of maximizing the range of uncertainty under which the welfare loss from error in the estimates of the marginal benefits and costs of emissions control can be limited.

40|$|A new {{automatic}} method {{based on}} the wavelet and Hilbert transforms for measuring the motor unit action potential (MUAP) duration is presented in this work. A total of 182 MUAPs from two different muscles were analysed. The average MUAP waveform was wavelet-transfomed, and a particular scale of the wavelet transform was selected to avoid baseline fluctuation and high frequency noise. Then, the Hilbert transform was applied to this wavelet scale to obtain its envelope. Amplitude and <b>slope</b> <b>criteria</b> in this envelope were used to obtain the MUAP start and end points. The results of the new method were compared to the gold standard of duration marker positions obtained by manual measurement. These new method was also compared to two another automatic duration methods: a recently method developed by the authors and a conventional automatic duration algorithm. The differences between the new algorithm’s marker positions and the gold standard of duration marker positions were in some cases smaller than those observed with the recently published and the conventional method. Our new method for automatic measurement of MUAP duration is more accurate than other available conventional algorithms and performs better than the recent method in some cases. ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we develop}} a {{spectral}} method for assessment of pasture quality {{based only on}} the spectral information obtained with {{a small number of}} wavelengths. First, differences in spectral behavior were identified across the near infrared–shortwave infrared spectral range that were indicative of changes in chemical properties. Then, slopes across different spectral ranges were calculated and correlated with the changes in crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and metabolic energy concentration (MEC). Finally, partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis was applied to identify the optimal spectral ranges for accurate assessment of CP, NDF and MEC. Six spectral domains and a set of <b>slope</b> <b>criteria</b> for real-time evaluation of pasture quality were suggested. The evaluation of three level categories (low, medium, high) for these three parameters showed a success rate of: 73 %– 96 % for CP, 72 %– 87 % for NDF and 60 %– 85 % for MEC. Moreover, only one spectral range, 1748 – 1764 nm, was needed to provide a good estimation of CP, NDF and MEC. Importantly, five of the six selected spectral regions were not affected by water absorbance. With some modifications, this rationale can be applied to further analyses of pasture quality from airborne sensors...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the ASME VIII Div 2 elastic-plastic stress analysis method for protection against plastic collapse is presented. Four example configurations are considered and calculated design pressures are compared with values determined by alternative procedures based on limit analysis and bilinear hardening/the twice elastic <b>slope</b> <b>criterion.</b> It is found that the ASME VIII Div 2 procedure does not generally lead to evaluation of higher design pressures than the alternative approaches. In an example configuration demonstrating significant geometric strengthening, the allowable load {{is limited by the}} local strain criterion and in practice user-defined service criteria would be applied to limit permanent deformation under design conditions. In two example configurations that failed through membrane action, the evaluated design pressure was found to be less than that based on limit analysis.

40|$|Two {{recently}} proposed {{design by}} analysis criteria of plastic collapse based on plastic work concepts, the plastic work (PW) criterion and the plastic work curvature (PWC) criterion, are applied to a strain hardening pipe bend arrangement subject to combined pressure and in-plane moment loading. Calculated plastic pressure-moment interaction surfaces are compared with limit surfaces, large deformation analysis instability surfaces and plastic load surfaces given by the ASME Twice Elastic <b>Slope</b> <b>criterion</b> and the tangent intersection criterion. The results show that both large deformation theory and material strain hardening {{have a significant effect}} on the elastic-plastic response and calculated static strength of the component. The PW criterion is relatively simple to apply in practice and gives plastic load values similar to the tangent intersection criterion. The PWC criterion is more subjective to apply in practice but it allows the designer to follow the development of the gross plastic deformation mechanism in more detail. The PWC criterion indicates a more significant strain hardening strength enhancement effect than the other criteria considered, leading to a higher calculated plastic load...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{models and}} grey system models (GSMs) are {{commonly}} used to evaluate and predict physical behavior. A physical model avoids the incorrect trend series of a GSM, whereas a GSM avoids the assumptions and uncertainty of a physical model. A technique that combines the results of physical models and GSMs would make prediction more reasonable and reliable. This study proposes a fusion method for combining two trend series, calculated using two one-dimensional models, respectively, that uses a <b>slope</b> <b>criterion</b> and a distance weighting factor in the temporal and spatial domains. The independent one-dimensional evaluations are upgraded to a spatially and temporally connected two-dimensional distribution. The proposed technique was applied to a subsidence problem in Jhuoshuei River Alluvial Fan, Taiwan.

Retesting all these specimens has considerable cost implications. It was therefore attempted to better characterise such inconclusive results, by comparing those that prove to be either negative or positive on follow-up testing. This retrospective, laboratory-based study found that 193 of 211 (91. 5 %) patients with with previous inconclusive results (defined as reported positive by CAP/CTM but with cycle threshold [Ct] values of > 32 and/or fluorescence intensity [FI] values of < 5) tested negative and only 18 (8. 5 %) positive using independently obtained follow-up samples after a median of 28 days). The only significant independent predictor of a later positive result was a higher FI value (3. 326 vs. 0. 495, p< 0. 0001), whereas Ct values were not independently predictive.

In pressure vessel Design by Analysis, the designer is required to assess both of these behaviour modes when specifying the allowable static load.

In this paper, plastic collapse or gross plastic deformation loads are evaluated for two sample torispherical heads by 2 D and 3 D FEA based on an elastic-perfectly plastic material model. Small and large deformation effects are considered in the 2 D analyses and the effect of geometry and load perturbation are considered in the 3 D analysis. The plastic load is determined by applying the ASME twice elastic <b>slope</b> <b>criterion</b> of plastic collapse and an alternative plastic criterion, the Plastic Work Curvature criterion. The formation of the gross plastic deformation mechanism in the models is considered in relation to the elastic-plastic buckling response of the vessels.

40|$|Many {{studies in}} {{agricultural}} areas {{focus on the}} place where the head of rills and gullies start, but little information is available on defining their limits in the transversal direction. Here, we compare the ability of image interpretation and terrain analysis to delineate gully limits accurately by using topographical criteria, and we propose an automated procedure for mapping gullies. A 600 m-long gully network was surveyed through an airborne campaign in order to obtain a high resolution elevation model (0. 06 m pixel size) in combination with differential GPS measurements for defining the reference perimeter. The gully was located near the city of Cordoba (southern Spain) with annual crops in a typical Campiña landscape. In all cases, the techniques based on terrain analysis over-performed those requiring visual interpretation of aerial images. Orthophotography interpretation was hindered by the existence of a crop-gully interface covered by weeds, that led mainly to overestimation of the gully area, although different trends were found among operators. 24 The <b>slope</b> <b>criterion</b> used to determine gully areas produced good results for medium-high resolutions, whereas the profile curvature was preferable when only high pixel sizes were available. An optimal resolution of around 0. 5 m was found for defining the gully perimeter when using topographic factors, showing that intermediate relative resolutions may be {{the most effective way to}} describe the geometry of the gully (5 - 10 % of the mean gully width). The automated procedure featured the combination of the slope and the local lowness index and the use of rendering display methods. It proved to be accurate when compared with the terrain analysis methods based on manual digitising and was found to be applicable on the landscape scale. The sequential implementation of the procedure for increasing resolutions improved the accuracy of the gully mapping by adapting the pixel size to the variability of gully dimensions. JRC.

Besides the traditional vineyards there are significant areas {{in some of the}} islands whose soils, climate and physiographic characteristics suggest a potential for wine production that deserves to be the object of an assessment, with a view to the development of new vineyard areas offering conditions for better management and sustainability. The landscape zoning approach for the present study was based in a geographic information system (GIS) analysis incorporating factors related to climate, topography and soils. Three thermal intervals referred to climate maturity groups were defined and combined with a single slope interval of 0 – 15 % to exclude the landscape units above this limit. Over this resulting composite grid, the soils were then selectively cartographed through the exclusion of the soil units not fulfilling the suitability criteria. The results show that the thermal interval of warmer conditions, well represented in the traditional terroir of Pico island, has practically no expression in the other islands.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Extensification is one {{policy in}} {{agriculture}} sector to obtain high production in crops. This policy usually utilizes {{large areas of}} land and therefore it requires a comprehensive spatial analysis for land use planning. This study assesses the advantages of SAR data to identify and delineate the potential area for paddy field in Banjar Regency, South Kalimantan, Indonesia. In order to fulfill the requirement of land evaluation especially for topography and soil moisture, SAR data are utilized. The successful launch of ALOS- 2 satellite with SAR sensor enables to obtain L-band SAR data which is more sensitive for soil moisture information. The L-band SAR is able to extract soil moisture information from bare soils to soils with vegetation. The backscatter coefficient or sigma nought (σ°) obtained by SAR sensors {{is related to the}} local topographic conditions, surface roughness and dielectric constant of the soil or objects. The significantly high difference in the dielectric constant between water and dry soil and its variation is an indicator of soil moisture concentration. The sigma nought that is composed of backscatter from vegetation, soil and the attenuation caused by the vegetation canopy can be expressed by model introduced by Engman and Gurney (1991). Various ALOS- 2 data from different observation strategies are processed to delineate area with suitable conditions for paddy field by utilizing Sentinel- 1 Toolbox (S 1 TBX) software.

40|$|This Thesis {{deals with}} the problem of the quality control and {{monitoring}} and the related energy consuming aspects in industrial multicomponent distillation columns. These have important relevance especially in case of units subjected to important changes in operating conditions which manifests in fluctuation of the product concentration. Due to the low reliability of the seldom available and delayed analytic composition measurements, they cannot be employed for an efficient online monitoring of the separation. Instead, this Thesis proposes the use of composition observers with passive innovation mechanism and driven by temperature measurements. The passive structure allows {{to limit the number of}} ODEs to be online integrated, which is a central issue to obtain a product suitable for the industrial implementation. The design of this passive structure involves the choice of number and location of the temperature sensors, the choice of the innovated component and the set of modeled components in the (possibly simplified) estimation model. This issue is addressed with a simple and systematic methodology that employs steady state information about the per-component temperature gradient of the column and detectability measures and conditions. Differently from the majority of the works in literature, the proposed methodology allows also to assess the feasibility of obtaining good estimation performance using the available temperature sensors in real columns. Even the analytic composition measurements cannot be employed for quality control in feedback control loops mainly due to delay problems. Instead, temperature feedback controllers are usually used. But even if the temperature sensor is well located (and in this Thesis a criterion for sensor location is suggested based on an extension of the <b>slope</b> <b>criterion</b> to the multicomponent case), when the operating conditions undergo changes, the indirect regulation of the product quality cannot be achieved, with alternating periods of under and over-purification that also adversely affect the energy requirement for the column functioning. Thus, in this Thesis an application oriented solution is proposed consisting in adding a feedforward temperature setpoint compensation that guarantee a close quality regulation, including a more efficient management of the energy, under the changing operating modes of the column. The methodologies and techniques proposed and described in this Thesis are tested with an industrial multicomponent IC 4 -NC 4 splitter located at the Sarlux Refinery (Sarroch, Italy), which, motivated by the good results, has already implemented the composition estimator and is going to implement the feedforward setpoint compensator...|$|E
40|$|In this Thesis, {{the problem}} of {{controlling}} and estimating compositions of interest in a multicomponent column with temperature measurements is addressed. This work is motivated by the necessity of (i) regulating some of the effluent compositions around the prescribed values for a given separation, in spite of disturbances entering the column as fluctuations in feed flow rate, composition and temperature, and (ii) estimating such compositions in order to monitor the separation. These problems cannot be practically solved by composition analyzers, because of their high costs of purchase and maintenance, their reliability issues and the delays in obtaining composition measurements. A possible solution is the employment of temperature measurements, which do not present the abovementioned shortcomings. In a multicomponent distillation column, the compositions in a tray are not uniquely determined by the temperature at the same tray, and therefore temperature sensors cannot provide composition control and estimation without offset. Thus, a methodology that permits the achievement of composition control and estimation objectives within a predetermined tolerance is necessary. The methodology illustrated in this Thesis is applied to a six-component C 3 -C 4 splitter through simulation examples {{in order to be}} assessed {{on the basis of the}} structural results, according to different control and estimation objectives. Both control and estimation problems are solved through a unified methodology that consists in the partition of both problems into a structural and an algorithmic part, puts together techniques already employed and new ideas, and permits a systematic design. As regards the control part, the structure is defined as the joint selection of (i) the temperatures to be regulated and (ii) their pairing with the chosen manipulated variables, while the algorithm is the dynamic data processor that processes temperature measurements in order to perform the control task. On the other hand, regarding the estimation part, the structure is defined as the joint selection of (i) a (possibly reduced) estimation model, (ii) the number and locations of temperature measurements, (iii) the states to be innovated through injection of temperature measurements and (iv) the regions in which the temperature can be approximated as the average one, while the algorithm is the dynamic data processor that processes temperature measurements in order to perform the estimation task. In this Thesis, we propose the temperature gradient with per-component contribution diagram as the mean for the selection of part of the control structure and of the entire estimation structure. Such diagram is the main tool of the used methodology, and consists in plotting temperature gradients at a nominal steady-state together with the contributions due to the components. The diagram is based on the well-known temperature <b>slope</b> <b>criterion,</b> which has extensively been used in control but, as will be shown in this Thesis, provides a simpler and more intuitive criterion for both control and estimation purposes in a multicomponent column, compared to other well-known methods. As concerns the control algorithm selection, conventional and cascade-type con-trollers with the assistance of first-order observers are developed on the basis of passivity concepts. Such controllers provide a systematic and easy tuning criteria and an anti-windup protection. Their employment is here extended to a multicomponent case. Geometric Estimator (GE) (with partial innovation) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) (with complete or partial innovation) based algorithms are chosen in order to carry out the estimation task. The GE approach, which provides a systematic tuning criterion, is here extended to a multicomponent case...|$|E
40|$|The {{water quality}} status of an Andean river basin was characterised and the {{pressures}} from anthropogenic activities were evaluated {{to enhance the}} available knowledge of the environment within an ecosystem in Peru. This investigation was conducted to assess the environmental status of the basin {{as a first step}} to introducing river management plans and specific water quality programmes. A continuous simulation model and an environmental monitoring program were developed, taking into account the European water framework directive (WFD) requirements. To prioritise the integrated water resources management (IWRM), an applied environmental model, the Soil and Water Assessment tool (SWAT) was used. The model was calibrated and validated for the Jequetepeque river basin using the SCE-UA algorithm and a relatively small amount of data (11 years). Five different cases of sub-basin discretisation were evaluated with and without a <b>slope</b> <b>criterion.</b> Very good hydrographs and statistics (NSE, RSR and PBIAS) were obtained for all cases. Environmental monitoring methods and tools for water quality evaluation were developed. The sources of contamination were identified and levels of contamination were quantified to evaluate pollution emissions. The degree of pollution by different substances, the associated risks, and the potential effects on aquatic life and human health were considered {{in the development of the}} tools and environmental monitoring methods. Water monitoring, sediment monitoring, and ecological monitoring, including a complementary effort to collect available data at the basin scale, were conducted in this study. The concentrations of trace elements were determined from the results of four water and sediment monitoring campaigns conducted between November 2008 and June 2010, and an ecological survey was evaluated. The results obtained from analysis of the water and sediment data indicated trace element pollution near mine sites, enabling us to quantify the impact of the mines on the Jequetepeque basin. Analysis of the water samples indicated that the most polluted water in the basin was located downstream from the Sipán SL Mine. The levels of Cr and As indicated adverse effects, whereas the levels of Al, Cd, Cu, Fe and Pb indicated significant effects on human health, mainly near the mining areas. Considering the lack of water facilities and trace element remediation in the region, special attention should be paid to regulatory policies and palliative countermeasures. Analysis of the sediment samples indicated that the most polluted sediment was located downstream from the Yanacocha Mine site and poses a significant threat to the environment in terms of Cd, Zn, Pb, and As pollution, regardless of the season. The sequential extraction analysis indicated higher mobility for Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, and Zn. Those trace elements are released to the water column depending on the environmental conditions. The kinetics of the most prevalent trace elements in the basin were also evaluated. A diffusion model and two first-order models were used successfully to describe the kinetic extraction of Cu, Pb, and Zn. These trace elements can be significant only under extremely acidic conditions (pH= 1); this should be taken into account in the potential scenario of acid mine drainage. The Ecological Status of Andean Rivers protocol was used to assess the upper part of the Jequetepeque river basin. At all the reference sites, the water quality status was very good or good. Only the sites located near mines exhibited alterations in the water quality, confirming the trends observed in the water and sediment monitoring. This protocol, which is an easy-to-use and economical qualitative tool, has proven to be very useful in assessing significant trends in ecological pollution of the basin.

This article simulates an open pit slope stability using the ANSYS software, {{which is based}} on the finite element strength reduction theory, three kinds of <b>slope</b> instability <b>criterion</b> of the strength reduction method are applied to judge whether the slope is on the limit equilibrium state, the incremental search method is used to search the safety factor of the slope stability, and the results show that, the slope body damages when the plastic zone developed from the top to the bottom, in the numerical simulation the finite element iteration calculation didn’t just converge, the corresponding former level of reduction factor is the safety factor, This article can have a guiding significance on the safety production of the open-pit mine...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess {{agricultural}} areas with natural handicaps, the European Commission proposed a set of biophysical criteria. In this report all criteria were applied to the Dutch agricultural areas. The application of the criteria showed that four criteria led to the delineation of areas with natural handicaps. The handicaps were soil drainage, texture, chemical properties and <b>slope.</b> The <b>criteria</b> for low temperature, heat stress, rooting depth and soil moisture balance were not applicable to the Dutch agricultural soils. All results were aggregated to LAU 2 units (municipality). An area at the scale of LAU 2 units was considered affected by significant natural handicaps if at least 66 % of the Utilised Agricultural Areas met {{at least one of}} the biophysical criteria. In total 109 LAU 2 units were considered a Less Favoured Are...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Physical {{scale model}} {{study of the}} {{mechanical}} behaviour of structures is of a vital importance in the design process and {{in the evaluation of}} performance of the prototypes. Important applications are in the fields of aeronautics, hydraulics, structural and mechanical engineering. It is also applied in mining engineering, particularly in relation to mine ventilation, the design of underground openings, evaluation of ground subsidence and <b>slope</b> stability. <b>Criteria</b> for the scaling of physical quantities involved in the model study of the deformation behaviour of underground openings are developed. The mechanical properties of the rock mass around an underground mine open-ing are determined and the corresponding properties of an equivalent model material are also assessed. The technique of scale model testing is de-scribed and the results of the model tests are compared with those of the measurement of deformation of the actual opening. 1...|$|R

Minimization of the point dispersion measure, which is maximized over all points in the region of interest is taken as the optimality criterion, and the minimax properties in some class of designs are derived in spherical and cubic regions of interest. We study the efficiencies of the minimax designs relative to other optimal designs with various criteria.

40|$|The gross plastic {{deformation}} and associated plastic loads of four axisymmetric torispherical pressure vessels {{are determined by}} two criteria of plastic collapse: the ASME twice elastic <b>slope</b> (TES) <b>criterion</b> and the recently proposed plastic work curvature (PWC) criterion. Finite element analysis was performed assuming small and large deformation theory and elastic–perfectly plastic and bilinear kinematic hardening material models. Two plastic collapse modes are identified: bending-dominated plastic collapse of the knuckle region in small deformation models and membrane-dominated plastic collapse of the cylinder or domed end in large deformation models. In both circumstances, the PWC criterion indicates that a plastic hinge bending mechanism leads to gross {{plastic deformation}} and {{is used as a}} parameter to identify the respective plastic loads. The results of the analyses also show that the PWC criterion leads to higher design loads for strain hardening structures than the TES criterion, as it takes account of the effect of strain hardening on the evolution of the gross plastic deformation mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Oregon's {{forestry}} {{industry has}} {{and will continue}} to be a vital component of Oregon's economy, with twenty-two percent of Oregon's 1986 gross state product and thirty-nine percent of Oregon's 1986 gross manufacturing product related the forestry goods. An integral component to proper management of Oregon's forestry lands is Sustaining the timber yield from the commercial forest land base. The Oregon Forest Practice Rules and Statue (1985) mandates that commercial forest lands &e subject to reforestation requirements. Forest lands which do not meet these requirements are candidate for deletion from the commercial forest land base. Reforestation of steep skeletal slopes has proven difficult; high seedling mortality has occurred due, in part, to dry raveling of the surface soil. Dry raveling is a form of slope failure on steep slopes generally characterized by surface movement of individual particles, and/or a shallow veneer of material. The extent of seedling mortality due to dry raveling s believed to be substantial in mountainous forest lands in Southwest Oregon. The present study represents a research effort to define the raveling process and the potential for seedling mortality due to dry raveling. Laboratory testing of the raveling process was conducted using a tilting bed constructed to infinite <b>slope</b> <b>criteria.</b> Sixty-one raveling tests were performed on material taken from ravel-prone sites in Southwest Oregon. Tests involved variations in water content, gain size distribution, and profile thickness. Raveling angles, profile mantle failure angles, and the angle of repose were examined, along with the kinematics of the granular flow during mantle failure. The raveling events were found to progress from individual particle movement, to particle assemblage movement, to mantle failure. A dry ravel model was proposed based on the analysis of the literature and test results. The ravel model reflected the dependence to the raveling system on the free surface boundary and momentum transfer to the surface material by the raveling particles. The angle of repose was identified as a fundamental soil property which can be related to a dry raveling potential and therefore used by forest management personal as a slope limit above which progressively greater dry ravel-induced seedling mortality will occur...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, two control {{approaches}} are presented for exploration rovers traversing sandy-sloped terrain. One {{of the proposed}} controls is a model-based feed-forward control using a characteristic diagram, called a Thrust-cornering characteristic diagram. It consists of various characteristic curves of wheel forces for varied wheel slip conditions. An appropriate steering maneuver for slope traversal can be found using the diagram with <b>slope</b> traversal <b>criteria.</b> The other control is a sensor-based feedback control. A key approach to this feedback control is to compensate for three types of slip, namely, the vehicle sideslip and longitudinal/lateral slips of a wheel. The feedback control cal-culates both steering and driving maneuvers that can compensate for these slips and also allow the rover to successfully traverse a sandy slope. The per-formances of these two control {{approaches are}} confirmed in slope traversal experiments using a four-wheeled rover test bed. The proposed controls are verified by quantitative evaluations of distance and orientation errors. Through the experiment, {{it was found that}} the two controls have advantages and dis-advantages, and the possibility of merging the model-based control and the sensor-based control is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{including}} material strain hardening on the gross plastic deformation (GPD) load of four sample problems from the EPERC Design by Analysis manual is investigated. The models considered are two axisymmetric vessels with flat heads under pressure, a nozzle/knuckle intersection under pressure, and a cylinder-cylinder intersection under combined pressure and moment loading. The results of limit analysis, large deformation elastic-perfectly plastic analysis, and {{small and large}} deformation bilinear hardening analysis are presented. Plastic loads are calculated using the ASME twice elastic <b>slope</b> (TES) <b>criterion</b> and the plastic work curvature (PWC) criterion. It is found that the plastic pressures given by the ASME TES criterion are inconsistent {{with respect to the}} limit load. The PWC criterion is found to represent strain hardening more consistently and lead to enhanced plastic loads. Von Mises equivalent plastic strain plots show that the form and extent of plastic deformation at the limit load in a perfectly plastic analysis and at the plastic load in a strain hardening analysis are similar, indicating a common definition of GPD...|$|R
