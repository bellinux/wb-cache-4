5|$|While {{undergoing}} conversion into a troop transport, {{the ability}} to operate aircraft was removed from Sydney. However, on seven of the troopship's twenty-five voyages to Vietnam, <b>she</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> flight of four Westland Wessex helicopters, sourced from either 725 or 817 Squadron, for anti-submarine surveillance.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of World War II, Lorraine served {{primarily}} in the western Mediterranean. On 4 December, Lorraine operated out of Casablanca against German surface forces, along with the cruisers Algérie, La Galissonnière, and Marseillaise, and several destroyers and submarines. During this period, <b>she</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> shipment of gold bullion from the French treasury to Bermuda. On 1 January 1940, she {{was transferred to the}} 2nd Battleship Division of the 1st Squadron, and went into drydock for refit, which lasted until April.|$|E
5|$|Libia {{marked a}} major {{advancement}} over earlier designs, owing {{in large part}} {{due to the fact that}} the ship was originally ordered by the Ottoman Navy. Based on the British-built , the ship was to have been named Drama, but the Ottoman government failed to make payments so construction stopped, and she was seized after the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War and completed for the Regia Marina. She was significantly larger, faster, and more heavily armored than the other Italian protected cruisers, but <b>she</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> weaker main battery.|$|E
5000|$|Thena wears {{body armor}} of unknown composition. <b>She</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> bow that fires arrows that release [...] "cold energy", and <b>she</b> <b>carries</b> <b>an</b> energy spear that {{surrounds}} victims with {{a ring of}} intense heat and light or bombards them with anti-gravitons.|$|R

50|$|According to the tradition, her colour {{is golden}} and her vehicle is lion. She has four arms. In her two right hands <b>she</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> mango {{and in the}} other a branch of a mango tree. In one of her left hands, <b>she</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> rein {{and in the other}} she has her two sons, Priyankara and Shubhankara.|$|R
5|$|She {{was armed}} with eight 38cm (15in) guns {{arranged}} in four twin gun turrets: two superfiring turret pairs {{fore and aft}} of the superstructure. Baden and her sister Bayern were the first German warships to feature guns of this caliber; earlier battleships carried either 28 or 30.5cm (11 or 12inch) guns. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 15cm (5.9in) guns, six 8.8cm (3.45in) guns and five 60cm (23.6in) underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam. Upon commissioning, <b>she</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> crew of 42 officers and 1,129 enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|The German navy {{found the}} ship to be very stiff in her {{sea-keeping}} qualities. Hansa was very maneuverable and was easily controlled while under sail; under steam the ship remained highly maneuverable but control suffered. The ship's crew numbered 28officers and 371 enlisted men. <b>She</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> number of smaller boats aboard, including two launches, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy. The ship also carried {{an unknown number of}} picket boats and barges. Anti-torpedo nets were briefly fitted to the ship from 1885 to 1888.|$|E
5|$|The ship's crew {{consisted}} of ten officers and 122 enlisted men. <b>She</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> number of smaller boats, including two pinnaces, two cutters, and one dinghy. Arminius {{was not a}} particularly successful design; she suffered from severe, fast rolling, especially in heavier seas. She also shipped {{a great deal of}} water over the bow and was unbalanced in steering. The ship turned rapidly to starboard but was sluggish in turning to port. Indeed, the ship was required to have the rudder at 15degrees to port in order to remain on a straight course. It was also impossible to control the ship with only sail power.|$|E

5|$|She visited Cape Town on 10 November 1895, {{and while}} {{on her way}} there, <b>she</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> granite copy of the padrão that had been placed there by the Portuguese {{explorer}} Diogo Cão in the late 15th century. The original stone monument had been transported back to Berlin for preservation in 1893 by Falke. A short period of dockyard maintenance lasted from 17 to 29 February 1896. On 6 March, she was sent to Swakopmund {{in response to an}} uprising by the local population. She send a landing party ashore to help the Schutztruppen (Protection force) secure the city. From 23 March to 9 April, Sperber went to Mossamedes for a period of rest for her crew. On 22 September, she departed Southwest Africa and headed for Germany; she arrived in Kiel on 18 November and was decommissioned on 7 December. Starting in early 1898, Sperber was taken into drydock for a major overhaul. The work lasted until August, and she was placed back in reserve once it was completed.|$|E
5|$|HMS Shannon {{had been}} off Boston for 56 days and was running short of provisions, whilst the {{extended}} period at sea {{was wearing the}} ship down. She would be at a disadvantage facing USS Chesapeake, fresh from harbour and a refit. A boat was despatched carrying the invitation, manned by a Mr Slocum, a discharged American prisoner. The boat had not reached the shore when Chesapeake was seen underway, sailing out of the harbour. She was flying three American ensigns and a large white flag at the foremast inscribed 'Free Trade and Sailor's Rights'. Shannon carried 276 officers, seamen and marines of her proper complement, eight recaptured seamen, 22 Irish labourers who had been 48 hours in the ship, of whom only four could speak English, and 24 boys, of whom about 13 were under 12 years of age. Broke had trained his gun crews to fire accurate broadsides into the hulls of enemy vessels, {{with the aim of}} killing their gun crews, rather than attempting to disable the enemy ship by firing at the masts and rigging. This was, however, the standard Royal Navy practise of the time, only Broke's efficiency in gunnery training distinguished him in this regard. Lawrence, meanwhile, was confident in his ship, especially since <b>she</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> substantially larger crew. Previous American victories over Royal Navy ships left him expectant of success. Just before the engagement, the American crew gave three cheers.|$|E
25|$|Austin was 125 feet {{in length}} and 31 feet across the beam, with a {{displacement}} of 600 tons and a draft of 12½ feet. <b>She</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> crew of twenty-three officers and warrant officers and 151 sailors and marines and was armed with sixteen medium twenty-four-pound cannons, two eighteen-pound medium cannons, and two eighteen-pound long cannons.|$|E

25|$|La Nymphe {{was built}} as a 32-gun frigate of the fourth rate (Quatrième Rang) at Brest, {{designed}} and constructed by Pierre-Augustin Lamothe. She was laid down in April 1777, launched on 18 August, and commissioned in November. <b>She</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> complement of 290 men, and was armed with twenty-six French 12-pounder guns and six French 6-pounders.|$|E
25|$|In 1801 Wellesley was {{designated}} a troop transport, {{one of a}} number of country ships that took, or were to take troops to Egypt as part of a force seeking to dislodge French forces there that threatened access to India. <b>She</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> detachment of the 80th Regiment of Foot, but after eight weeks at sea she returned to Bombay. Gordon explained that it had been impossible to make safe passage to the Red Sea.|$|E
25|$|Surry was a square-rigged {{transport}} ship of 443 tons burthen. She had {{an overall}} length of 117ft. 6 ins., a breadth above the gunwales of 29ft. 6 ins, and a draught, when loaded, of 18ft. She was copper-sheathed, and had quarter galleries, with {{a bust of}} Minerva for a figurehead. When carrying prisoners and stores in 1816 she drew 16ft. 3 ins. forward and 17ft. 2 ins. aft, being down by the stern eleven inches. <b>She</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> crew of thirty and was armed with fourteen cannons.|$|E

25|$|Equipped with {{a double}} hull, Andrea Doria was divided into 11 {{watertight}} compartments. Any two of these could be filled with water without endangering the ship’s safety. Andrea Doria also carried enough lifeboats to accommodate all passengers and crew. <b>She</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> total of 16 steel lifeboats, eight positioned {{on each side of}} the ship, coming in three different designs; two 58-person launches for emergency use, two 70-person motorboats with inboard radio transmitters, and 12 146-person hand-propelled standard boats. Furthermore, the ship was equipped with the latest early warning radar. However, despite its technological advantages, the ship had serious flaws concerning its seaworthiness and safety.|$|E
25|$|Slave voyage #4: Kitty's Amelia {{underwent}} coppering {{and repairs}} in 1807. Then on July 1807 Thomas Forrest {{received a letter}} of marque for Kitty's Amelia. The Act for {{the abolition of the}} slave trade had passed Parliament in 1806 and took effect on 1 May 1807. However, Kitty's Amelia had received clearance to sail 27 April, before the deadline. Thus, when she sailed on 27 July, she did so legally. This was the last legal slave voyage for an English vessel. On her voyage <b>she</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> supercargo, Captain Hugh Crow (or Crowe), who was a renowned and successful slave trader. On the way to Bonny, Forrest died and Crow took command.|$|E
25|$|Although a small transport, McClellan, {{with her}} two stateroom-fitted decks and extra bathrooms, had better {{accommodations}} {{than some of the}} other small transports, as a result of which she not infrequently carried officers and their families along with other dignitaries. One of her first such voyages to Manila occurred in July 1901 when <b>she</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> party of U.S. Congressmen on a fact-finding mission. In February of the following year, McClellan carried 200 teachers to the same destination, including 80 females. In November of the same year, the Army's Engineering Dept. proposed the conversion of McClellan into a dredge to assist with work in the Ambrose Channel in New York Harbor, which had fallen well behind schedule, but this proposal was successfully resisted by the Quartermasters' Dept., and McClellan continued in service as a transport.|$|E

60|$|A tall, slovenly dressed woman {{answered}} his ring. <b>She</b> <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> oil lamp {{in her hand}} and eyed her late visitor severely.|$|R
25|$|Her {{outer garment}} {{was a bright}} colored plaid worsted cloak {{reaching}} to within about six inches of the floor. Its size was most voluminous, but its fashion was extremely simple. It had a wide yoke across the shoulders, into which the broad plain breadths were gathered; and it was fastened at the throat by a huge ornamented brass hook and eye, from which hung a short chain of round twisted links. Her right arm protruded through a vertical slit {{at the side of}} the cloak and she held in her hand a sheet of paper covered with figures. The left arm on which <b>she</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> large basket or bag — I couldn't tell which — was hidden by the ample folds of the garment. Her countenance was keen and nervous, but benignant.|$|E
25|$|From then on, {{whenever}} she ran short of money (which generally happened {{every three or}} four years), she went on tour, performing both her classics and new plays. In 1888, she toured Italy, Egypt, Turkey, Sweden, Norway, and Russia. She returned to Paris in early 1889 with an enormous owl given to her by the Grand Duke Alexis Alexandrovich, the brother of the Czar. Her 1891–92 tour was her most extensive, including much of Europe, Russia, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Samoa. Her personal luggage consisted of 45 costume crates for her 15 different productions, and 75 crates for her off-stage clothing, including her 250 pairs of shoes. <b>She</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> trunk for her perfumes, cosmetics and makeup, and another for her sheets and tablecloths and her five pillows. After the tour, she brought back a trunk filled with 3,500,000 francs, but she also suffered a painful injury to her knee when she leaped off the parapet of the Castello Sant' Angelo in La Tosca. The mattress on which she was supposed to land was misplaced, and she landed on the boards.|$|E
25|$|At Epsom Downs Racecourse on 5 June Time Charter {{was one of}} {{thirteen}} fillies to contest the 204th running of the Oaks Stakes (known for sponsorship reasons as the Gold Seal Oaks). Despite her performance in the 1000 Guineas, she was not among the favourites and started at odds of 12/1, probably because, {{as the daughter of}} a sprinter, she was thought unlikely to be effective over one and a half miles. Billy Newnes (who was still an apprentice jockey at the time) restrained Time Charter {{at the back of the}} field before moving up on the outside in the straight. She took the lead inside the final furlong and won by a length from Slightly Dangerous, with Last Feather third, Awaasif fourth and All Along fifth. Her winning time of 2:34.21 was a record for the race and was faster than that recorded by Golden Fleece when winning the Derby over the same course and distance three days earlier. Time Charter reappeared in the Nassau Stakes (then a Group Two race) over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse in late July. As a Group One winner <b>she</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> seven-pound weight penalty and finished second, beaten two lengths by Dancing Rocks.|$|E
