5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between August and November 1996, Venom: The Hunger {{introduces the}} Venom symbiote's reliance on phenethylamine for survival (which requires it to eat human brains after depleting Brock's <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemical) and reveals that chocolate {{is a source}} of the chemical. Brock refuses to eat human brains; the symbiote abandons him, and he is locked in an asylum under the care of the deranged Dr. Paine. Brock escapes to hunt the symbiote, which has gone on a killing spree to obtain brains. He reunites with the symbiote (after finding an alternative source of the chemical), but Paine steals the symbiote for himself. Brock frees the symbiote, and again becomes Venom.|$|E
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E

5|$|Cats are obligate carnivores: their {{physiology}} {{has evolved}} to efficiently process meat, {{and they have}} difficulty digesting plant matter. In contrast to omnivores such as rats, which only require about 4% protein in their diet, about 20% of a cat's diet must be protein. Cats are unusually dependent on a constant <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal. Another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce taurine, with taurine deficiency causing macular degeneration, wherein the cat's retina slowly degenerates, causing irreversible blindness.|$|E
5|$|Chard was a {{key point}} on the Taunton Stop Line, a World War II {{defensive}} line consisting of pillboxes and anti-tank obstacles, which runs from Axminster north to the Somerset coast near Highbridge. In 1938 a bomb proof bunker was built behind the branch of the Westminster Bank. During the war {{it was used to}} hold duplicate copies of the bank records in case its headquarters in London was destroyed. It was also used to store the emergency bank note <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bank of England. There has also been speculation that the Crown Jewels were also stored there, however this has never been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In the assembly, Larrea {{promoted}} a customs law which taxed most imports, but made exceptions for machines, scientific tools, books, weapons and military supplies. He organized a local mint, and the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Army of the North. The {{presidency of the}} assembly rotated, and Larrea presided from April 30 to June 1, 1813. During this time the Assembly outlawed torture and repealed all noble titles, and also chose the official Argentine National Anthem.|$|E

5|$|Pituitary {{apoplexy}} or pituitary tumor apoplexy is bleeding into or impaired blood <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{pituitary gland}} {{at the base}} of the brain. This usually occurs in the presence of a tumor of the pituitary, although in 80% of cases this has not been diagnosed previously. The most common initial symptom is a sudden headache, often associated with a rapidly worsening visual field defect or double vision caused by compression of nerves surrounding the gland. This is followed in many cases by acute symptoms caused by lack of secretion of essential hormones, predominantly adrenal insufficiency.|$|E
5|$|The 10th-century Persian {{geographer}} Ibn al-Faqih {{wrote of}} a local legend related {{by the people of}} Lajjun regarding the source of the abundant spring used as the town's primary water source over the ages: there is just outside al-Lajjun a large stone of round form, over which is built a dome, which they call the Mosque of Abraham. A copious stream of water flows from under the stone and it is reported that Abraham struck the stone with his staff, and there immediately flowed from it water enough to suffice for the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people of the town, and also to water their lands. The spring continues to flow down to the present day.|$|E

There, he met Anna Purnell, {{the daughter of a}} Chicago businessman, who was there as a YMCA volunteer. The two were married in August 1919. They had three children together, all daughters. While in Germany, Somervell also met Walker D. Hines, a prominent New York corporate lawyer, whom he assisted with a survey of shipping and navigation on the Rhine River. Somervell reverted to the permanent rank of major on 1 July 1920.|$|E

5|$|The French Directory did as well. In mid April, {{suffering}} from an nephritic complaint, Jourdan handed over command to {{his chief of}} staff, general of division Jean Augustin Ernouf, and returned to Paris {{to complain about the}} lack of men, the inexperience of the men he had, their supplies, and the size, experience, and <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army he had to face.

5|$|The <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DB 600 {{remained}} {{extremely limited}} as production was soon switched {{over to the}} fuel-injected DB 601, which was reserved for the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters. Therefore, production versions of the basic Do 17M model airframe were fitted with the new Bramo 323A-1 Fafnir engines of 670kW (900hp), which gave reasonable performance and raised the bomb load to 1,000kg (2,200lb). The resulting Do 17 M-1 was produced in small numbers and operated until 1941.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of wetland {{complexes}} in the watershed of Stafford Meadow Brook. These include Bear Swamp (which is at the stream's headwaters), Simerson Marsh, and Little Virginia. The first of these is a Pocono wetland bog. Lakes in the watershed include Lake Scranton, the District Number Fifty-Nine Reservoir, the Williams Bridge Reservoir, and Hazard Pond. Lake Scranton and the Williams Bridge Reservoir are used as a water supply, with the former providing 22 million gallons of water per day. Together with Roaring Brook and Spring Brook, it provides {{a substantial portion of the}} water <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lackawanna Valley.

5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E
5|$|Another command, {{established}} under {{emergency conditions}} when a convoy intended for <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Philippines, {{known as the}} Pensacola Convoy, was rerouted to Brisbane due to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Brigadier General Julian F.

The next day, by radiogram, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George C. Marshall, ordered Barnes to assume command as Commander, US Troops in Australia and take charge of all troops and supplies. On 22 December 1941, with the convoy's arrival in Brisbane, the command was designated as United States Forces in Australia (USFIA). It was renamed U.S. Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA) on 5 January 1942. Its mission was to create a base in Australia for the support of the forces still in the Philippines.|$|E
