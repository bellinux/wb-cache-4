40|$|These {{past years}} have seen an {{enormous}} development of the area of natural antioxidants and antimicrobials. Eucalyptus globulus is widely cultivated in subtropical and Mediterranean regions in intensive short rotation coppice plantations. In the Portuguese context, E. globulus is the third species in terms of forest area. The stump is the basal part of the tree, including the near-the-ground stem portion and the woody roots that remain after stem felling. The purpose of this work was to study the phytochemical profile and to evaluate the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of several crude <b>stump</b> <b>wood</b> and stump bark extracts of E. globulus, comparing it with similar extracts of E. globulus wood (industrial chips). The results showed the presence of high concentrations of total phenolic compounds (> 200 mg GAE/g extract) and flavonoids (> 10 mg QE/g extract) in E. globulus stump extracts. Generally the <b>stump</b> <b>wood</b> extracts stands out from the other ones, presenting the highest percentages of inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation.

40|$|Wood fuels make a key {{contribution}} to {{renewable energy sources}} in the Nordic countries. The growing demand for forest biomass can be partly met by utilising energy-rich stumps left after clear cutting. As fuel, <b>stump</b> <b>wood</b> is commonly associated with a high presence of contaminants, resulting in high ash content. The concentration of contaminants depends on factors such as soil type, weather conditions, harvesting method, storage duration and other handling operations. The high ash content is a major drawback when using <b>stump</b> <b>wood</b> as fuel. Handling methods that could improve fuel quality are therefore highly desirable. To produce a fuel of acceptable quality, i. e. with low moisture and ash content and high energy value, the above-mentioned factors require evaluation and quantification. In this thesis, various handling methods within the supply chain for Norway spruce stump and their effects on the biomass as fuel are evaluated. The following handling processes are dealt with: harvesting technique, pre-treatments including stump splitting/fractionation and cleaning using vibration or sieving, storage methods and storage duration. Choice of stump harvesting head proved {{to have an impact}} on fuel quality, as splitting of stumps during extraction allowed better drying during storage. Such stumps could be stored directly in windrows, since no difference could be established between this method and storage in heaps prior to windrow storage. In general, storage improved fuel quality. Changes in fuel quality parameters do not reflect the whole picture, however, since dry matter losses occur during storage, and therefore the storage period should be kept as short as possible. During winter months, when demands for fuel are highest, stump ash content can be high, since frozen contaminants are difficult to detach from stumps during transport. To achieve acceptable fuel quality during high demand periods, long storage duration or a pre-treatment involving additional stump cleaning is required. Fuel quality was clearly improved by vibration-based cleaning before the comminution of stumps or by sieving <b>stump</b> <b>wood</b> after crushing. These methods can allow <b>stump</b> <b>wood</b> fuel of acceptable quality to be supplied within a harvesting season...|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} energy wood potential in Europe, in particular in 25 European countries that are members of the European Union from the beginning of May 2004. Estimation of the energy wood potential has been divided into estimation of roundwood balance, and estimation of felling residues. Study has been limited to forests available for wood supply. Roundwood balance illustrates unutilized increment that could be used for industrial purposes, for energy production or left in the forests as it is the difference between net annual increment and felling. Felling residues that are usually left in the forest are becoming increasingly important source for wood energy. Forest resources in Europe have been increasing during the last 50 years. Roundwood balance based on the difference between net annual increment and fellings is approximately 186 million m 3 per year or 32 % of the net annual increment. The roundwood balance has been clearly positive for a long time, and thus increasing amount of wood has accumulated in the forests, resulting in denser forest and older age class structures. Roundwood balance can be regarded as a kind of surplus or reserve that is left in the forests currently. Competition of the wood resources is increasing and obviously fulfilment of the demands for industrial use, energy production and protection would require compromises. Use of roundwood directly for energy purposes would depend of the prices of roundwood, especially that for wood-based panels, pulp and paper as well as for energy production. The potential sources of forest fuels are felling residues and stumps from current fellings and the roundwood balance, consisting of the stem wood balance, its crown mass and <b>stump</b> <b>wood.</b> It was estimated that felling residues total 173 mill. m 3 annually. Annually harvestable residues were estimated to be 63 mill. m 3. In addition, about 9 mill. m 3 <b>stump</b> <b>wood</b> (out of 78 mill. m 3 total potential) could be used for energy production. When 25 % of the roundwood balance is directed to energy use, 64 mill. m 3 of above ground biomass and about 4 mill. m 3 of <b>stump</b> <b>wood</b> could be used for energy annually. Thus the available forest fuel totals about 140 mill. m 3 per year, i. e. about 56 mill. owen dry tons of wood, which corresponds to about 280 TWh of energy or 24 Mtoe. This would be about 24 % of the current use of renewables in EU 25. For comparison, available forest fuels equal to about 37 % of the current annual fellings...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} forest energy potential in Europe, in particular in 27 European countries that were members of the European Union as of the beginning of 2007. The study is limited to forests available for wood supply. Positive annual change rate of the growing stock illustrates unutilized surplus, which is currently left in the forests. It could be used for industrial purposes for energy production as it is the difference between net annual increment and fellings. Felling residues that are usually left in the forest are becoming an increasingly important source for energy production. Forest resources in Europe have been increasing during the last 50 years. Annual change rate is approximately 238. 6 million m³ per year or 35 % of the net annual increment. The annual change rate has been clearly positive for several decades, and thus an increasing amount of wood has accumulated in the forests, resulting in them becoming denser with older age class structures. Competition for the wood resources is increasing and obviously fulfilment of the demands for industrial use, energy production and protection would require compromises. The use of roundwood directly for energy purposes would depend on the prices of roundwood, especially that for wood-based panels, pulp and paper as well as for energy production. The potential sources of forest fuels are felling residues and stumps from current fellings and the complementary fellings from the annual change rate surplus, including the roundwood, crown mass and <b>stump</b> <b>wood.</b> It was estimated that felling residues total 211 million m³ annually. Annually harvestable residues were estimated to be 76. 5 million m³. Annually harvestable <b>stump</b> <b>wood</b> was estimated to be 7. 4 million m³. The total amount of annually harvestable residues and stumps is altogether 83. 9 million m³ which could be used for energy production. If complementary fellings were to be 25 % of the annual change rate surplus and directed entirely to energy use, 101. 6 million m³ of above ground biomass and about 1. 2 million m³ of <b>stump</b> <b>wood</b> could be used for energy annually. Thus the available forest fuel totals about 187 million m³ per year, i. e. about 150 million tonnes of fresh wood, which corresponds to about 411 TWh of energy or 36 Mtoe. The study also examined the supply costs of chips made from logging residues in the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and UK. The lowest supply costs were found to be in Finland and the Czech Republic whereas the highest costs were in the UK and France...|$|E
40|$|Impurities in {{harvested}} stumps are {{a quality}} problem because {{high levels of}} mineral contaminants decrease the effective heating value of the <b>stump</b> <b>wood,</b> and can also affect ash melting behaviour during combustion, leading to sintering and drift problems. The aim of this case study was to clarify the productivity and screening efficiency of the Kompetech Crambo 6000 low-speed double-shaft grinder equipped with a Komptech star screen, in the integrated grinding and screening of Norway spruce and Scots pine stumps for fuel at a roadside landing, when using two different sieve sizes (250 x 320 mm and 180 x 180 mm screen baskets). Furthermore, we studied the fuel consumption of the Crambo 6000 grinder, ash content and particle size distribution of ground <b>stump</b> <b>wood,</b> and ash content and particle size distribution of the screening reject. In addition, the heating value of the produced hog fuel and screening reject were analysed. During {{the time of the}} studies, both the grinder and star screen were operating well and there were no delays due to machine breakdowns. The mobile Crambo 6000 grinder was also capable of operating well in constricted roadside landings. The quality of the produced hog fuel was high, due to low ash content (0. 4 – 2. 3 %), and this highlights the significance of screening to guarantee sufficient quality when processing stump fuel. The ash content of the screening reject was 32. 4 – 74. 7 %, and the effective heating value was 5. 2 – 13. 4 MJ/kg. The effective heating value of the produced hog fuel was 17. 9 – 19. 9 MJ/kg. The average grinding productivity, when using the 250 x 320 mm screen basket, was 162 loose m 3 per effective hour, and the fuel consumption of the grinder was 0. 44 litres per loose m 3.

40|$|<b>Stump</b> <b>wood</b> is a {{possible}} source of renewable energy, but before its potential as a fuel can be utilised to a high degree, new harvesting techniques should be developed to reduce the environmental impact (notably ground disturbance) of harvesting stumps. The forces required to lift and drag stumps out of the soil are known. In this study, two unknown and important parameters were addressed: the torque required to uproot stumps by twisting them and the torque required to cut lateral roots around stumps. A new, improved stump-twisting rig was designed and used in trials with 28 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) trees (breast-height diameter over bark, 153 – 427 mm). The measured torque requirements ranged from 10 to 50 kNm. Twisting stumps required more torque than cutting lateral roots around stumps and the required torque increased with increases in stump size. The results indicate that a wrist on a big feller-buncher, but not a conventional rotator used on forest machines, {{should be able to}} generate sufficient torque to cut the roots around stumps such as those used in this study...|$|E
40|$|Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) {{develops}} an {{adventitious root}} system along {{the base of}} the stem. The development of such adventitious roots, coupled with the buildup of the forest floor with time, means that the root collar of mature trees is located under these adventitious roots, below ground level. To examine the validity of ring counts at ground level for black spruce age determinations, the stumps of 39 understory trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) were excavated and cut into 2 -cm cross sections, sanded, and the age estimated by cross-dating techniques. Cross-dating below the adventitious roots added 3 – 19 years to the age estimates compared with the age at ground level. All study trees demonstrated a reverse taper in the buried part of the stem, such that the recent growth rings were progressively lacking in the sections closer to the true root collar. The stem of most of the trees also had a horizontal or sinuous juvenile growth period, which was now included in the <b>stump</b> <b>wood.</b> This age underestimation from ring counts at ground level appears to explain discrepancies in the literature regarding the postfire establishment period of black spruce...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} forest biomass as raw {{material}} {{for a wide range}} of products in the developing bioeconomy is expected to increase. Along with a constant pressure on forestry to increase its productivity, this development has led to the search for new procurement methods and new assortments. The present study assessed innovative supply chain practices, with a particular focus on the integrated supply of stemwood and residual tree parts. The assortments considered included tree sections, long tops, saw logs with stump cores and small whole trees from thinnings. The assessment included geographically explicit modelling of the supply chain operations and estimation of supply cost and energy use for three industrial locations in Northern Sweden. The innovative supply chains were compared to conventional, separate, harvest of stemwood and logging residues. We conclude that integrated harvest of tops and branches with stemwood assortments, as well as whole-tree harvest in early thinnings, has a significant potential to reduce the supply cost for the non-stemwood assortments. <b>Stump</b> <b>wood</b> generally remains the most expensive assortment. The energy use analysis confirms earlier research showing that the energy input is relatively small compared to the energy content of the harvested feedstock...|$|E

40|$|Tree stumps {{could make}} a {{significant}} contribution to the transition from a fossil- to a bio-based economy, but current stump harvesting operations have adverse ecological effects. The ground disturbance caused by the up-rooting leads to increased carbon emissions from the soil and increases risks of leaching of heavy metals and nutrients, while removal of <b>stump</b> <b>wood</b> increases nutrient removal and reduces amounts of dead wood in the forest. However, the ground disturbance could be reduced by introducing new techniques. The overall objective of the studies this thesis is based upon was to investigate possible future systems for stump harvesting capable of reducing ground disturbance, and estimate their economic sustainability. Studies were based on experimental field studies and simulations. The ground disturbance depends on the type of harvesting head, as harvesting the whole stump creates more disturbance than harvesting {{the central part of the}} stump; the ground disturbance is also larger on peat soil than on mineral soil, but does not depend on time since clear cutting; and the root breakage diameter is surprisingly small (5 - 30 mm) after whole stump harvests and is not affected by the time since clear-cutting. Twisting stumps loose requires large torques and cannot be considered a viable way of extraction. The ground disturbance and cost to industry was estimated for four systems: a conventional whole stump harvesting system (WSH), a stump centre harvesting (SCH) system and two possible future systems for integrated harvest and forwarding of stem and stump centres with separation of the stump centres at either the landing (IHL) or industrial sites (IHI). The IHI and SCH systems are estimated to be up to 100 % and 60 % more costly, respectively, than WSH. However, costs of IHL were estimated to be similar with WSH for large trees. WSH (up-rooting) caused five times more ground disturbance per hectare compared to the other systems. In conclusion, the conventional up-rooting system was estimated to be best from an economic perspective, but caused more ground disturbance then harvesting of stump centres only. If ground disturbance restrictions are introduced, and new technologies are developed accordingly, costs of utilizing <b>stump</b> <b>wood</b> will be higher than at present. In development of integrated stump centre harvesting systems, as described here, it is crucial to design techniques and methods that minimize possible risks of damaging the stem wood in order to secure timber quality. Finally, regardless of future regulations, whole stump up-rooting technologies will still be warranted for treating stands infected by root rot...|$|E

30|$|Management {{of natural}} {{deciduous}} forest entails {{the removal of}} comparatively low amounts of biomass {{and the application of}} longer rotations than in conventional fast-growing plantations (Gómez-García et al. 2016). Provided that conventional patterns of extraction of woody components are applied, there are no major concerns about the nutrient sustainability of these native, extensively managed deciduous forests (Ranger and Turpault 1999). However, this is not true for intensively exploited forest plantations or SRF, and one of the key aims of nutrient sustainability in such cases is to obtain an overall balance by assessing the nutrient fluxes that occur throughout the rotation, including the amounts removed during clearfelling (Laclau et al. 2010; Vanbeveren et al., 2016). Estimation of the amounts of nutrients removed requires knowledge of the amounts of biomass in each compartment (<b>stumps,</b> <b>wood,</b> bark, branches of different sizes and leaves) and the nutrient concentrations in these components (Viera et al. 2016). However, the main drawback of this approach is that nutrient concentrations in biomass compartments vary depending on plantation age, site and even tree density (Judd et al. 1996; Rytter 2002; Leite et al. 2011), although the concentrations stabilize in mature stands (Augusto et al. 2008).

The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|R
