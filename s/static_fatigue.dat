50|$|SCC is the {{unexpected}} sudden {{failure of a}} stressed material exposed to an aqueous, corrosive fluid. <b>Static</b> <b>fatigue</b> {{is also found in}} this embrittlement form, such as the moisture-enhanced <b>static</b> <b>fatigue</b> of glass, hydrogen embrittlement, embrittlement of some polymers in adverse environmental effect, etc. The <b>static</b> <b>fatigue</b> is also manifested similarly to the one described in ME.

50|$|ME {{happens when}} a low-melting-point metal is placed in contact with a metal with higher melting point, so the latter is embrittled. It is often {{manifested}} by <b>static</b> <b>fatigue.</b> For example, as shown in Figure 1, in {{a test of the}} <b>static</b> <b>fatigue</b> of a 2024 aluminum coated with mercury, the alloy is subject to a stress level less than the value causing plastic flow, and {{the time it takes to}} fracture is measured. Usually a stress called <b>static</b> <b>fatigue</b> limit is present, representing the boundary below which the material does not fracture, no matter how long the test duration is. In this scenario, the <b>static</b> <b>fatigue</b> often depends on the presence of initial s.  Also, if the material is “flaw-free”, its <b>static</b> <b>fatigue</b> limit serves as a design parameter in a hostile environment.|$|E

The perceived {{uncertainty in the}} long-term structural performance of bonded members when subjected to static/fatigue loads in aggressive environments is probably restricting an even more widespread use of this joining technology.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the <b>static</b> and <b>fatigue</b> behavior of adhesively bonded single lap joints in SMC-SMC composites. Effects of lap length and adhesive thickness on the <b>static</b> and <b>fatigue</b> strength of SMC-SMC adhesive joints are studied. Effects of SMC surface preparation and test {{speed on the}} joint performance are evaluated. Finally, the effect of water exposure on the joint durability is also investigated. Results show that the static behavior of adhesive joints in SMC-SMC composites is significantly influenced by the lap length and adhesive thickness. With an increase in lap length from 12. 7 mm to 38. 1 mm, the joint failure load increases by 37 %. The joint failure load also increases with the adhesive thickness, but it reaches a maximum at an adhesive thickness of 0. 33 mm and then decreases. However, lap length and adhesive thickness have negligible effect on the ratio of <b>fatigue</b> strength to <b>static</b> strength. The <b>fatigue</b> strength at 10 6 cycles is approximately 50 % to 54 % of the static strength for various adhesive thicknesses and lap lengths investigated in this study.

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} surface damage on the fatigue behavior of zirconia under two different loading conditions. Materials and methods. One hundred twenty zirconia bar-shaped received either airborne particle abrasion using 50 μm or 120 μm alumina particles while polished specimens served as control. The specimens were subjected to two fatigue regimes: dynamic fatigue (1, 000, 000 cycles, 1 hz and 0. 5 s contact time) or <b>static</b> <b>fatigue</b> (a constant load applied for 5000 s) under water using the staircase application of the load. The flexure strength after fatigue (dynamic fatigue strength) was compared to the initial flexure strength of the tested specimens (α = 0. 05). The critical crack shape and size of fractured specimens was examined using scanning electron microscopy. Results. Compared to the initial flexure strength of the tested specimens, dynamic fatigue strength was 86. 3 % for the polished specimens, 73. 4 % for 50 μm particle abrasion, and 42. 3 % for 120 μm particle abrasion while the <b>static</b> <b>fatigue</b> strength was 85. 9 %, 78. 5 %, and 51. 5 % respectively.

Moreover, under cyclic loading failure on these components initiates under lower stress states so that fatigue behavior of curved composite laminates are critical. This thesis discusses the experimental investigation of fatigue behavior of curved composite laminates under bending moment. Bending moment is obtained at the curved region by applying axial load from both tips of the curved composite laminates. A special loading fixture is designed in order to apply axial load to curved specimens in universal testing machine. Two different lay-up configurations are investigated; [0] 15 s unidirectional as fiber dominated and [03 / 903 / 03 / 903 / 03]s cross-plied laminates as matrix dominated. Static loading experiments are conducted in order to obtain average ultimate strength of materials to use in fatigue loading experiments and compare the damage pattern with the fatigue failure.
