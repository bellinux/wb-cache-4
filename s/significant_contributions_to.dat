5|$|A {{scholar and}} teacher {{throughout}} his life, Priestley also made <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> pedagogy, including {{the publication of}} a seminal work on English grammar and books on history, and he prepared some of the most influential early timelines. These educational writings were among Priestley's most popular works. It was his metaphysical works, however, that had the most lasting influence: leading philosophers including Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer credit them among the primary sources for utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Despite his mixed legacy, Sargsyan is {{now widely}} {{recognized}} as a national hero {{across the political spectrum}} and by the public. Given the honorific Sparapet, he made <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> the establishment of Armenia as independent state and ensuring its security as the founder of the Armenian Army. He has also been criticized by human rights organizations for being undemocratic, especially for his role in elections. Sargsyan was awarded the highest titles of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh—National Hero of Armenia and Hero of Artsakh.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} at Carlisle, Warner made several <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> {{football}} offense, including the body block technique and the single- and double-wingback formations. Under Warner, Carlisle quarterback Frank Mount Pleasant and fullback Pete Hauser became two of the first regular spiral passers in football (the forward pass was legalized in 1906). In 1908 he introduced the technique of body blocking, instead of blocking with the shoulders.|$|E

5|$|Gregory {{lacked the}} {{administrative}} ability {{of his brother}} Basil or the contemporary influence of Gregory of Nazianzus, but he was an erudite theologian who made <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity and the Nicene Creed. Gregory's philosophical writings were influenced by Origen. Since the mid-twentieth century, there has been a significant increase in interest in Gregory's works from the academic community, particularly involving universal salvation, which has resulted in challenges to many traditional interpretations of his theology.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Paul Karrer elucidated {{the correct}} {{structure}} for beta-carotene, the main precursor of vitamin A, and identified other carotenoids. Karrer and Norman Haworth confirmed Albert Szent-Györgyi's discovery of ascorbic acid and made <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> {{the chemistry of}} flavins, {{which led to the}} identification of lactoflavin. For their investigations on carotenoids, flavins and vitamins A and B2, they both received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, a mothers aid {{group from}} the Chicago Maternity Center raised $30,000 to endow a {{professorship}} in obstetrics in DeLee's name at the University of Chicago.

Garrison Keillor resurrected old-style radio comedy with A Prairie Home Companion, which has aired since 1974. A cult scifi cable t.v. triumph, Mystery Science Theater 3000, was created by Joel Hodgson in Hopkins, and Minneapolis, MN. Another popular comedy staple {{developed}} in the 1990s, The Daily Show, was originated through Lizz Winstead and Madeleine Smithberg.|$|E

5|$|Burnet made <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> {{influenza}} research; {{he developed}} techniques {{to grow and}} study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the neuraminidase that is secreted by Vibrio cholerae, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk's significant work on glycoproteins and the neuraminidase substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|Gould made <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> {{evolutionary}} developmental biology, {{especially in}} his work Ontogeny and Phylogeny. In this book he emphasized the process of heterochrony, which encompasses two distinct processes: neoteny and terminal additions. Neoteny is the process where ontogeny is slowed down and the organism does not {{reach the end of}} its development. Terminal addition is the process by which an organism adds to its development by speeding and shortening earlier stages in the developmental process. Gould's influence in the field of evolutionary developmental biology continues to be seen today in areas such as the evolution of feathers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also made <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth {{where they can be}} studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, radiation damage to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of multi-layer insulation. One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.|$|E

5|$|In {{early modern}} Europe, the {{systematic}} study of fossils emerged {{as an integral part}} of the changes in natural philosophy that occurred during the Age of Reason. In the Italian Renaissance, Leonardo Da Vinci made various <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> the field as well designed numerous fossils. At the end of the 18th century Georges Cuvier's work established comparative anatomy as a scientific discipline and, by proving that some fossil animals resembled no living ones, demonstrated that animals could become extinct, leading to the emergence of paleontology. The expanding knowledge of the fossil record also played an increasing role in the development of geology, particularly stratigraphy.|$|E
5|$|The CPS men served without {{wages and}} minimal {{support from the}} federal government. The cost of {{maintaining}} the CPS camps and providing {{for the needs of}} the men was the responsibility of their congregations and families. CPS men served longer than regular draftees and were not released until well {{after the end of the}} war. Initially skeptical of the program, government agencies learned to appreciate the men's service and requested more workers from the program. CPS made <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> forest fire prevention, erosion and flood control, medical science and reform of the mental health system.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (TPS) {{graduated}} {{the following}} notable alumni who made <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> the aerospace field. The school's {{mission is to}} produce experimental test pilots, flight test engineers, and flight test navigators to lead and conduct test and evaluation of aerospace weapon systems. The school was established on September 9, 1944 as the Flight Test Training Unit at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB) in Dayton, Ohio. To {{take advantage of the}} uncongested skies and superb flying weather, the school was moved on February 4, 1951 to its present location at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert of Southern California. Edwards AFB is the home of the Air Force Flight Test Center and has been an integral part of flight testing for over fifty years.|$|E
