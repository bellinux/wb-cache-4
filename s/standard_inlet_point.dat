40|$|Abstract: The water intaking {{system of}} a water works usually {{controlled}} the rotation rate of water pumps manually according to experiences, with low accuracy rate and poor energy-saving effect in the past. Combining with the system status, this paper brings forward constructing a variable frequency water intaking control system with PLC and inverter as the core, and by means of fuzzy PID control. During operation of the system, PLC will get the <b>standard</b> <b>inlet</b> flow required for the clean water tank through PID operation according {{to the difference between}} the set water level and actual water level of the clean water tank. Then, PLC will compare the <b>standard</b> <b>inlet</b> flow and actual inlet flow of the clean water tank, output control signals through fuzzy PID operation, control the working frequency of inverter, and then control the rotation rate of water pump, adjust the inlet flow of clean water tank, and realize stable liquid level of clean water tank in water supply workshop. The operation and experiment demonstrates that the system make the work of water intaking automated in some degree. It is good for energy saving and improving the management of water works.

(21 0 km) long, includes over 180 higher-order tributaries draining more than 2, 000 square mi. (5, 100 squarekm). For the model ofthis basin, simulated runoff loadings were accumulated at major jtmctures, or <b>inlet</b> <b>points,</b> for up to 14 land use categories {{in each of the}} 356 sub-watersheds, resulting in over 3, 000 RUNOFF module sub-basins. This allows results to be summarized by land use, by model basin, by accumulated groupings of sub-watersheds, and for the entire watershed study area.

The use ofSWMM at this scale uncovered nmnerous limitations of the model requiring either modifications to the SWMM code or the implementation of functional work-arounds.

40|$|Belyaev and Levin (Journal of Aerosol Science, 5 (1974) 325) (B&L) empirically derived a {{function}} for aspiration efficiencies A of thin-walled inlets operated at low velocity ratios U/U- 0 (U flow velocity inside the inlet, U- 0 {{velocity of the}} free flow). This function, which is especially applicable for particle sampling on fast, high-altitude aircraft, has not been experimentally or theoretically verified. By means of the computational fluid dynamics model (CFX), we evaluate this B&L function by explicitly determining inlet aspiration efficiencies {{over a wide range}} of high-altitude airborne applications. We find good agreement in the range where B&L performed their measurements (U/U- 0 = 0. 18 - 0. 2, particle Stokes numbers Stk > 0. 1), but for lower U/U- 0 and smaller Stk the B&L function deviates from the CFX results. Therefore, we provide here a modified B&L function covering the ranges U/U- 0 = 0. 007 - 0. 2 and Stk > 0. 001 :A(Stk) = (a Stk + b) /(a Stk + 1 + b) (U- 0 /U) + c(U/U- 0) a = 1. 26, b = 0. 27, c = 0. 50, (a) U/U- 0 0. 001. In addition, we used CFX to analyze the performance of a short inlet and demonstrate the strong sensitivity of the sampling characteristics to the inlet design, i. e. the particle transmission efficiency changes from zero for a <b>standard</b> <b>inlet</b> to 30 % for a short inlet and the aspiration efficiencies of smaller particles are lower by approximately a factor of two when sampled with the short in comparison to the <b>standard</b> <b>inlet.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

System set ups for the entire cooling generation including reject heat and hydraulic components and control are within the focus. While a 160 kW absorption chiller is on the test bench, 50 kW absorption systems are already running in 2 demonstration plants. The chiller operates in between 25 and 140 % of load at thermal COP´s in the range of 0. 80 and can stationary deliver cold down to part load of 5 %. While driving heat can be used from 55 °C up to 110 °C at the <b>inlet</b> (<b>standard</b> operation <b>point</b> is at 90 / 72 °C in/out), reject heat inlet temperatures up to 45 °C are feasible for normal operation mode.
