5|$|Before {{entering}} production, Kill the Irishman had {{a troubled}} development <b>stage</b> <b>that</b> lasted over a decade.

5|$|Marmarosa {{returned}} to Pittsburgh due to health reasons in 1948. He began performing much less frequently, {{and had a}} presence only locally for around a decade. Friends and fellow musicians had commented from an early <b>stage</b> <b>that</b> Marmarosa was an unusual character. His mental stability was probably affected by being beaten into a coma when in his teens, by a short-lived marriage followed by permanent separation from his children, and by a traumatic period in the army. He made comeback recordings in the early 1960s, but soon retreated to Pittsburgh, where he played occasionally into the early 1970s. From then until his death three decades later, he lived with family and in veterans' hospitals.|$|E
