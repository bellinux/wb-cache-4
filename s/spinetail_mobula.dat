50|$|The <b>spinetail</b> <b>mobula</b> ray has a pelagic {{lifestyle}} {{and has been}} observed both alone and in groups. It feeds on zooplankton by filtering sea water.|$|E
50|$|Mobula japanica, {{commonly}} known as the spinetail devil ray, <b>spinetail</b> <b>mobula</b> ray or japanese mobula ray, is a species of pelagic marine fish which belongs to the family Myliobatidae. It is found throughout the tropical and sub-tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific and eastern Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} mitochondrial genome of {{a widely}} distributed pelagic ray, the <b>Spinetail</b> Devilray (<b>Mobula</b> japanica), consists of 18, 880 bp with high A+T and low G content. Gene configuration and length {{is similar to}} other vertebrates and comprises 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs genes (12 S and 16 S rRNA), 22 tRNAs genes, and 1 major non-coding sequence, the control region. A remarkable feature in the mitochondrial genome of M. japanica is three tandemly repeated areas in the control region, together comprising a length of almost 1500 bp, making this to our knowledge the longest elasmobranch mitochondrial genome published so far. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCaptures of 11 <b>spinetail</b> devil rays, <b>Mobula</b> japanica (Müller et Henle, 1841), {{from the}} {{northern}} coast of Tunisian (central Mediterranean) are reported in the present paper. Of these 11 specimens, fi ve specimens were described. These captures constitute the fi rst records of the species in the Tunisian waters, {{but also in the}} Mediterranean Sea, extending its distribution. This unusual occurrence of M. japanica is probably due to a migration from the eastern tropical Atlantic into the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar...|$|R
40|$|This study {{confirms}} the diet and determines the trophic {{position of the}} bentfin devil ray (<b>Mobula</b> thurstoni) and <b>spinetail</b> devil ray (<b>Mobula</b> japanica) in the south-west Gulf of California. There has been an active fishery {{in the area for}} these filter-feeding elasmobranchs, which are highly susceptible to exploitation due to low fecundity and long lifespan. However, information on their basic biology is scarce. δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of devil rays and zooplankton (sorted according to trophic level: herbivores, carnivores and omnivores) were determined over a period of 11 months, to allow for isotopic temporal variations in isotopic signals {{at the base of the}} food web. On the basis of fractionation factors we determined that bentfin and spinetail devil rays fed mainly on Nyctiphanes simplex, the most abundant euphausiid in neritic waters of the Gulf of California. The trophic positions obtained for the devil rays correspond to second level consumers...|$|R
50|$|In recent years, {{fishing for}} Mobulidae has {{received}} a significant boost by price increases for their gill rakers {{in the market for}} traditional Chinese medicine. In addition to targeted catches, the species is also subject to losses from bycatch, particularly in the gillnet fishery. As such sustained losses have a high impact on a species which has a low fecundity rate, a long gestation period with only a single offspring at a time, and late sexual maturity, the <b>spinetail</b> <b>mobula</b> ray has been classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spinetail</b> <b>mobula</b> ray {{is a large}} ray {{which can}} grow up to a maximal width of 3.1 m (average width 2.3 m).Like most rays, it is dorsoventrally {{flattened}} and has relatively large triangular pectoral fins {{on either side of}} the main body disc. At the front, it has a pair of cephalic fins which are forward extensions of the pectoral fins. These can be rolled up in a spiral for swimming or can be flared out to channel water into the ventral mouth when the animal is feeding.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the theory}} of {{evolution}} by natural selection was first postulated, biologists have noted that life histories evolve following broad patterns across all organisms. Understanding the mechanisms causing these relationships is the central focus of life history theory; these insights {{can also be used to}} better estimate the biology and extinction risk of data-poor species. Sharks, rays, and chimaeras (class Chondrichthyes) are an ideal taxon to explore these relationships as they have evolved a broad range of life history strategies. In this thesis, I focus on two key time-related life history parameters that are often used as a measure of productivity: growth coefficient k, which is estimated from the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF), and maximum intrinsic rate of population increase rmax, estimated by simplifying the Euler-Lotka equation. I begin by clarifying two methodological problems regarding the estimation of growth and productivity. I first show that fixing the y-intercept in the VBGF, a common approach in chondrichthyan age and growth studies, often causes considerable bias in growth coefficient estimates, and recommend using the three-parameter VBGF instead. I then point out an important omission in a method commonly used for estimating r max in chondrichthyans and clarify the correct way to estimate it. Next I explore the effect of uncertainty on the estimation of r max and show that species with low annual reproductive outputs are bound to have very low productivities, thus focus should be placed into accurately estimating litter sizes, breeding intervals, and the variability of these traits. As an example of how these insights can be applied, I better estimate growth and productivity for a data sparse species of conservation concern, the <b>Spinetail</b> Devil Ray (<b>Mobula</b> japanica), and show it has a much lower somatic growth rate than previously thought and one of the lowest productivities among chondrichthyans. Finally, I show that productivity in chondrichthyans varies with temperature as well as depth, and that the scaling of this relationship changes with temperature according to the expectation from Bergman’s rule. My thesis demonstrates that simple insights from life history theory can further our knowledge on the broad patterns that shape the evolution of life histories we see today, which can be used to inform management of data-poor species...|$|R
