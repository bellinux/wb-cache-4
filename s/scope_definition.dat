The briefing document might be called the Familiarization Guide, Briefing Guide, Project <b>Scope</b> <b>Definition,</b> or the Management Definition Guide - or anything else that seems appropriate.

50|$|When a {{construction}} site is being built, the constructor raises a fence on the site defining {{the boundaries of the}} construction. This process of building a fence is called scoping. Scope management is the process of defining what work is required and then making sure all of that work - and only that work - is done. Scope management plan should include the detailed process of scope determination, its management and its control. This needs to be planned in advance before the commencement of the project during mobilization phase. Project manager must seek formal approval on a well-defined and clearly articulated scope. To identify scope, requirements must be gathered from all stakeholders. Gathering requirements from only a few stakeholders or only the sponsor might lead to incorrect definition of scope. Large projects require more time, effort and resources to gather requirements and thus defining the scope is important. <b>Scope</b> <b>definition</b> helps us make sure that we are doing all the work but only the work included in the scope management plan. Gold plating a project (adding extras) is not allowed. Changes in scope must be taken into consideration all the knowledge areas of project management such as time, cost, risk, quality, resources and customer satisfaction. Integrated change management process is required to approve changes to scope of a project. Integrated Change Management includes updating of Change Request Form by Change Originator and also tracking the change on Change Control Register.|$|E

40|$|A {{complete}} {{definition of}} the scope of a project upfront during early stages ensures smooth and successful implementation during the project execution. This research identifies and prioritises project <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> elements for public buildings in Saudi Arabia. Elements that could significantly contribute to complete project <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> package at pre-project planning stage are identified and their interrelationship determined and prioritised. Using the Project Definition Rating Index (PDRI) as a basis, the study uses analytical network process (ANP) technique based on data obtained from project managers who have been involved in public sector projects in Saudi Arabia. Data collection and analysis was conducted in three steps. The first step involved identification of <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> elements while the second involved an investigation into interrelationships among the elements. In the third step, ANP was used to determine the weight of the elements ’ importance in terms of contribution to project <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> completeness. Finally, Pareto analysis was used to prioritise and assess the distribution pattern of the elements. The outcome from this research is the prioritisation of project <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> elements for public building projects in Saudi Arabia. The prioritised list developed indicates the importance of project <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> elements. It should help project management teams identify elements to consider when evaluating project <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> for completeness at the pre-project planning stage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProject <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> is {{the process}} whereby a project is defined and {{prepared}} for execution. It helps to decide {{on whether or not}} to proceed with the project. An incomplete <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> in early stages of a project's life cycle is a common source of difficulty in construction project development process. Meanwhile, the developing of the project can effect positively or negatively a variety of interests. Construction projects in specific bring different degrees of changes on the surrounding environment and people, not only limited at the construction site. Therefore, project definitions boundaries may be redefined, or subjected to differing expectations and interpretation by different stakeholders. The literature suggests that project <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> practices and stakeholders’ management are two separate domains, which are often investigated separately. However, project <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> practices can benefit from stakeholders’ management theories. Using procedural justice and participation theories to bring together the two domains, this research will contribute to theory and practice in the project management field. The paper develops a conceptual framework of an ongoing PhD research that seeks to answer the main research question ‘How can the level of project <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> completeness be evaluated to account for differences in stakeholders’ concerns to facilitate a better project outcome in public building projects? The research aims to develop a procedure that should help a project management team measure the completeness of project <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> with adequate consideration for stakeholders’ inputs at the pre-project planning stage of building projects, thereby facilitating a better project outcome...|$|E
