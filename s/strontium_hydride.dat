40|$|Powder x-ray {{diffraction}} experiments and first-principles calculations {{have been carried}} out to investigate the possibility of a structural phase transition, characterized by a change from ionic to covalent bonding, in <b>strontium</b> <b>hydride</b> at pressures greater than 50 GPa. The powder {{x-ray diffraction}} results confirm a previously reported transition from the cotunnite structure to the Ni 2 In structure at approximately 8 GPa. The Ni 2 In phase remained stable up to the maximum experimental pressure of 113 GPa. The first-principles calculations, however, predict that under hydrostatic conditions a transition from the Ni 2 In structure to the AlB 2 structure will occur at 115 GPa. A comparison of the pressure-dependent volume yielded by the respective experimental and theoretical studies suggests that in many cases the bulk modulus obtained from experiments carried out under non-hydrostatic conditions may be overestimated. Raman spectroscopy experiments corroborated the previously proposed Ni 2 In structure, as the spectra obtained at pressures greater than 8 GPa exhibited two Raman-active modes, consistent with those expected from the Ni 2 In structure.

40|$|The crystal {{chemistry}} of the barium fluoride chloride system is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Different synthetic approaches yield nanocrystalline materials {{as well as}} large single crystals. The crystalline phases identified so far are BaFCl, Ba 12 F 19 Cl 5 and Ba 7 F 12 Cl 2 (in two modifications) and compared with analogous compounds. It is demonstrated that the compound Ba 2 F 3 Cl reported by Fessenden and Lewin 50 years ago corresponds to Ba 7 F 12 Cl 2. The phase diagram of the BaCl 2 – BaF 2 system is reinvestigated for fluoride mole fractions between 0. 5 and 1. The peritectic formation of Ba 12 F 19 Cl 5 is observed. Periodic DFT calculations are performed for all structures in this system, including a hypothetical structure for Ba 2 F 3 Cl, based on the experimental structure of Ba 2 H 3 Cl. The energy of formation of the different barium fluoride chloride compounds from BaCl 2 and BaF 2 (normalized for one barium atom per formula unit), as calculated by DFT at 0 K, is within only about ± 15 kJ/mol. Comparison with recent experimental results on calcium and <b>strontium</b> <b>hydride</b> chloride (bromide) compounds, suggest {{the possibility of a}} mutual exclusion between the M 2 X 3 Y and M 7 X 12 Y 2 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb, X = H, F, Y = Cl,Br) structures. The single crystal structure of PbFBr is also reported...|$|E
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} relates to the {{preparation}} and structural and electrical characterisation of calcium and strontium hydrides, imides and nitride hydrides. Conventional solid state methods in controlled atmospheres were used to synthesise these materials. High temperature neutron diffraction, thermal analysis and conductivity studies performed on calcium and <b>strontium</b> <b>hydride</b> suggest an order – disorder transition in these materials at 350 – 450 °C. Disordering is believed to involve rapid exchange of hydride ions across two crystallographic sites. This manifests itself in a lowering of the activation energy for bulk hydride ion conduction. The hydride ion conduction is good in these undoped materials: σ[total]subscript = 0. 01 S/cm for CaH₂ at 1000 K; for SrH₂, σ[total]subscript = 0. 01 S/cm at 830 K. Doping of SrH₂ with NaH causes {{a significant increase in}} the low temperature conductivity, due to presence of extrinsic defects. The high temperature conductivity is negatively affected by NaH doping. Calcium nitride hydride (Ca₂NH) was obtained as a single phase material by reacting either calcium metal or calcium hydride (CaH₂) in an argon atmosphere containing 5 – 7 % H₂ and 1 – 7 % N₂. Imide ions substituting for hydride and nitride ions constitute a major chemical defect in this material. Long range ordering of the nitride and hydride ions occurs, giving rise to a double cubic crystal symmetry. This order breaks down at 600 – 650 °C. Applying the same reaction conditions to strontium metal results in a mixed phase of strontium nitride hydride and imide. No long range order in the nitride hydride phase could be observed. Doping Ca₂NH with lithium hydride (LiH) causes the appearance of a second calcium imide phase, whereas doping with sodium hydride (NaH) increases the amount of imide ions as a defect in the nitride hydride structure, thereby decreasing the long range ordering of nitride and hydride ions.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{methodology}} to evaluate matrix {{elements of the}} effective core potentials (ECPs) within one-electron basis set of Slater-type orbitals (STOs). The scheme is based on translation of individual STO distributions {{in the framework of}} Barnett-Coulson method. We discuss different types of integrals which naturally appear and reduce them to few basic quantities which can be calculated recursively or purely numerically. Additionally, we consider evaluation of the STOs matrix elements involving the core polarisation potentials (CPP) and effective spin-orbit potentials. Construction of the STOs basis sets designed specifically for use with ECPs is discussed and differences in comparison with all-electron basis sets are briefly summarised. We verify the validity of the present approach by calculating excitation energies, static dipole polarisabilities and valence orbital energies for the alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr, Ba). Finally, we evaluate interaction energies, permanent dipole moments and ionisation energies for barium and <b>strontium</b> <b>hydrides,</b> and compare them with the best available experimental and theoretical data.
