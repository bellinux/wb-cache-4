5|$|Eye {{irritation}} can {{be avoided}} by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> {{than the rest of}} the bulb. Refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{pesticides}} {{were first}} used around 2500 BC, when the Sumerians used <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> as insecticides. Modern pest control was {{stimulated by the}} spread across the United States of the Colorado potato beetle. After much discussion, arsenical compounds were used to control the beetle and the predicted poisoning of the human population did not occur. This {{led the way to}} a widespread acceptance of insecticides across the continent. With the industrialisation and mechanization of agriculture in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the introduction of the insecticides pyrethrum and derris, chemical pest control became widespread. In the 20th century, the discovery of several synthetic insecticides, such as DDT, and herbicides boosted this development.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{analyses}} of the composition of durian aroma found numerous volatile compounds including esters, ketones, and different <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds,</b> with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour. People in South East Asia with frequent exposures to durian are able to easily distinguish its sweet-like ketones and esters scent from rotten or putrescine odours which are from volatile amines and fatty acids. Developmental or genetic differences in olfactory perception and mapping within the brain (for e.g. anterior piriform cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex) could possibly explain why some individuals are unable to differentiate these smells and find this fruit noxious whereas others find it extremely pleasant and appealing.|$|E

25|$|A {{microbial}} {{fuel cell}} (MFC) is a device that converts chemical energy to electrical energy {{by the action of}} microorganisms. These electrochemical cells are constructed using either a bioanode and/or a biocathode. Most MFCs contain a membrane to separate the compartments of the anode (where oxidation takes place) and the cathode (where reduction takes place). The electrons produced during oxidation are transferred directly to an electrode or, to a redox mediator species. The electron flux is moved to the cathode. The charge balance of the system is compensated by ionic movement inside the cell, usually across an ionic membrane. Most MFCs use an organic electron donor that is oxidised to produce CO2, protons and electrons. Other electron donors have been reported, such as <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> or hydrogen. The cathode reaction uses a variety of electron acceptors that includes the reduction of oxygen as the most studied process. However, other electron acceptors have been studied, including metal recovery by reduction, water to hydrogen, nitrate reduction and sulfate reduction.|$|E

40|$|Removal of air pollutants, such as {{nitrogen}} and <b>sulphur</b> containing <b>compounds</b> from a model oil (dodecane) was stud-ied. An ionic liquid (1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride [C 2 mim] [Cl]) {{was used as}} an extractant. Liquid-liquid ex-traction by using 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride [C 2 mim] [Cl] was found to be a very promising method for the removal of N- and S-compounds. This was evaluated by using a model oil (dodecane) with indole as a neutral nitrogen compound and pyridine as a basic nitrogen compound. Dibenzothiophene (DBT) was used as a <b>sulphur</b> <b>compound.</b> An extraction capacity of up to 90 wt % was achieved for the model oil containing pyridine, while only 76 wt % of indole in the oil was extracted. The extraction capacity of a model <b>sulphur</b> <b>compound</b> DBT was found to be up to 99 wt%. Re-generation of the spent ionic liquid was carried out with toluene back-extraction. A 1 : 1 toluene-to-IL wt ratio was per-formed at room temperature. It was observed that, for the spent ionic liquid containing DBT as a model compound more than 85 wt % (corresponding 3852 mg/kg) could be removed from the oil. After the second regeneration cycle, 86 wt % of the DBT was recovered from the ionic liquid to toluene. In the case of indole as the nitrogen containing species, more than 99 wt%, (corresponding to 2993 mg/kg) of the original indole was transferred from the model oil to the ionic liquid. After the first-regeneration cycle of the spent ionic liquid, 54 wt % of the indole-in-IL was transferred to toluene.

40|$|Bacteria {{from the}} genus Acidithiobacillus are often {{associated}} with biominingand acid mine drainage. Biomining utilises acidophilic, sulphur and ironoxidising microorganisms for recovery of metals from sulphidic low grade oresand concentrates. Acid mine drainage results in acidification and contaminationwith metals of soil and water emanating from the dissolution of metal sulphidesfrom deposits and mine waste storage. Acidophilic microorganisms play acentral role in these processes by catalysing aerobic oxidation of sulphides. Acceleration of mineral solubilisation is a positive aspect in biomining whereas,in acid mine drainage it is undesirable and accordingly, microbial iron andsulphur oxidation is promoted {{in the first case}} and measures are taken to inhibitit in the second case. In this thesis, several approaches were taken in order tounderstand and increase oxidation efficiency in biomining and to gain an insightinto the biochemical reactions taking place in these environments. A laboratoryscale bioreactor was designed and tested allowing simulation of bioleaching inheaps of mine tailings at different aeration, irrigation and particle size conditions(Paper I). A new psychrotolerant strain of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans wascharacterised that has an application in boreal heap bioleaching.
