40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model {{study of the}} impact of <b>drifting</b> <b>snow</b> on the lower atmosphere, surface snow characteristics, and surface mass balance of Antarctica. We use the regional atmospheric climate model RACMO 2. 1 /ANT with a high horizontal resolution (27 km), equipped with a <b>drifting</b> <b>snow</b> routine and forced by ERA-Interim (1989 – 2009) at its lateral and ocean boundaries. <b>Drifting</b> <b>snow</b> sublimation (SUds) is significant in Antarctica, especially in the coastal regions (> 150 mm water equivalent yr! 1). Integrated over the ice sheet, SUds removes " 6 % of the annually precipitated <b>snow.</b> <b>Drifting</b> <b>snow</b> interacts with the atmosphere, as it increases the lower atmospheric moisture content and reduces surface sublimation (SUs), and leads to increased snowfall in regions where the atmosphere usually is close to saturation. <b>Drifting</b> <b>snow</b> sublimation (SUds) is smallest in summer, when katabatic wind speeds are lower and melting and surface sublimation consolidate the snow surface. Compared to a simulation without <b>drifting</b> <b>snow,</b> total sublimation (SUds + SUs) doubles on the grounded ice sheet if <b>drifting</b> <b>snow</b> is considered. <b>Drifting</b> <b>snow</b> erosion is locally significant, but can be neglected on a continent-wide scale...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is really}} your property," [...] he said, keeping {{his eyes on}} me, with an {{interested}} and wistful expression, {{as he had done}} ever since I had entered the house. [...] "Forty years ago your mother used to write at this very table. In our house in Oratow, it stood in the little sitting-room which, by a tacit arrangement, was given up to the girls--I mean to your mother and her sister who died so young. It was a present to them jointly from your uncle Nicholas B. when your mother was seventeen and your aunt two years younger. She was a very dear, delightful girl, that aunt of yours, of whom I suppose you know nothing more than the name. She did not shine so much by personal beauty and a cultivated mind in which your mother was far superior. It was her good sense, the admirable sweetness of her nature, her exceptional facility and ease in daily relations, that endeared her to every body. Her death was a terrible grief and a serious moral loss for us all. Had she lived she would have brought the greatest blessings to the house it would have been her lot to enter, as wife, mother, and mistress of a household. She would have created round herself an atmosphere of peace and content which only those who can love unselfishly are able to evoke. Your mother--of far greater beauty, exceptionally distinguished in person, manner, and intellect--had a less easy disposition. Being more brilliantly gifted, she also expected more from life. At that trying time especially, we were greatly concerned about her state. Suffering in her health from the shock of her father's death (she was alone in the house with him when he died suddenly), she was torn by the inward struggle between her love for the man whom she was to marry in the end and her knowledge of her dead father's declared objection to that match. Unable to bring herself to disregard that cherished memory and that judgment she had always respected and trusted, and, on the other hand, feeling the impossibility to resist a sentiment so deep and so true, she could not have been expected to preserve her mental and moral balance. At war with herself, she could not give to others that feeling of peace which was not her own. It was only later, when united at last with the man of her choice, that she developed those uncommon gifts of mind and heart which compelled the respect and admiration even of our foes. Meeting with calm fortitude the cruel trials of a life reflecting all the national and social misfortunes of the community, she realized the highest conceptions of duty as a wife, a mother, and a patriot, sharing the exile of her husband and representing nobly the ideal of Polish womanhood. Our uncle Nicholas was not a man very accessible to feelings of affection. Apart from his worship for Napoleon the Great, he loved really, I believe, only three people in the world: his mother--your great-grandmother, whom you have seen but cannot possibly remember; his brother, our father, in whose house he lived for so many years; and of all of us, his nephews and nieces grown up around him, your mother alone. The modest, lovable qualities of the youngest sister he did not seem able to see. It was I who felt most profoundly this unexpected stroke of death falling upon the family {{less than a year after}} I had become its head. It was terribly unexpected. Driving home one wintry afternoon to keep me company in our empty house, where I had to remain permanently administering the estate and at tending to the complicated affairs--(the girls took it in turn week and week about)--driving, as I said, from the house of the Countess Tekla Potocka, where our invalid mother was staying then to be near a doctor, they lost the road and got stuck in a <b>snow</b> <b>drift.</b> She was alone with the coachman and old Valery, the personal servant of our late father. Impatient of delay while they were trying to dig themselves out, she jumped out of the sledge and went to look for the road herself. All this happened in '51, not ten miles from the house in which we are sitting now.|$|E
