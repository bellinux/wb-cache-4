5|$|Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), {{last seen}} in Fallen Angel, is {{traveling}} on an airplane, Flight 549, which flies over upstate New York. He watches another {{man on the}} plane {{who seems to be}} following him. The man heads to the plane's bathroom, where he assembles a zip gun. However, when he comes back out, the airplane begins <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> a bright light flashes outside, showing that the plane is encountering a UFO. The emergency door next to Max's seat is opened.|$|E
5|$|The video cuts {{between two}} narratives. In the first, a hunter (uncredited actor) straps a 16-gauge shotgun around his shoulder, and tracks {{footsteps}} through the snow, eventually finding the Swamplord (the band's mascot, here as depicted {{on the covers}} of The Black Waltz and For the Revolution). In the second narrative, the band members, dressed warmly in heavy clothing, are sitting around a campfire, preparing a kettle of an unknown drink. As each person takes a sip, they begin convulsing. To simulate the drink's effects, the camera used <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> rapid zooming. As the song finishes, Pekka pours himself a drink and is the only one immune to its effects.|$|E

5|$|On July 16, 2009, {{as workers}} were {{assembling}} Madonna's {{stage at the}} Stade Vélodrome in Marseille for her July 19 concert, the stage collapsed, injuring eight workers and killing two. The accident caused city officials to cancel the concert. Charles Criscenzo, a 53-year-old French worker, was killed outright in the accident, which took place at around 17:15 GMT. The other worker Charles Prow, a 23-year-old from Headingley in Leeds, died overnight {{at a hospital in}} Marseille. Firefighters said the accident occurred when the roof of the stage became unbalanced as it was being lifted by four cranes, toppling one of them. Marseille city councillor Maurice de Nocera said that the roof started <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> then collapsed gradually. This allowed the other workers to get out in time.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1755 earthquake, Boston and its {{surrounding}} towns have become a major metropolitan area. Much new construction has been built on infill, especially in the Back Bay area, which may be prone to greater <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> to compaction of the sand and gravel used as fill. Many older buildings in the Boston area are built from stone and brick, {{and are likely to}} collapse completely during a major earthquake. Given this, modern observers have expressed concern about the effects of another quake in such a major city. A 1990 study by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency estimated potential financial losses at between $4 billion and $5 billion, and potential loss of life in the hundreds. As a consequence, the state has updated building codes and zoning laws to require that new construction and additions in vulnerable areas be built to resist earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to visit}} Madame Zirinka again, who {{tells him that}} the planets come into {{alignment}} like this only once every 84 years, and additional alignments will cause anyone born on January 12, 1979 (Margi and Terri's birthdate) {{to have all the}} energy in the cosmos focused on them. Margi goes to see Scott alone but an angry Terri arrives. The two argue with each other and end up accidentally killing Scott. Margi goes to Mulder, telling him that Terri is responsible for the murders, while Terri goes to see Scully and tells her the opposite. The agents call each other and bring both girls to the police station, where the place starts <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> all the guns go off on their own. Mulder locks the girls in a room together and their power goes away once the clock ticks midnight. When the town mob and Detective White finally see Terri and Margi as the culprits, Spitz claims it was the work of Satan, oblivious to the cosmic alignment's energy. Mulder and Scully drive home, arguing again over directions; when Scully defiantly runs a stop sign, Mulder notifies her but she tells him to shut up, which he does.|$|E

5|$|Mulder visits Max's trailer {{again and}} looks through his mail, finding a luggage claim ticket. Scully visits Sharon, {{now in a}} mental institution, who tells Scully that she stole {{technology}} from her employer that Max believed was alien. The device was in three parts, one which she had, one that he brought {{on the plane and}} a third one. Mulder uses the claim ticket to obtain the third device at a New York airport and heads on a plane to return to Washington. Garrett, who is also aboard, sits next to him. Mulder soon realizes who Garrett is and holds him at gunpoint. Garrett does not care, telling Mulder that if he shoots him the plane will depressurize and {{he will be able to}} escape with a parachute he has with him. Mulder imprisons Garrett in the airplane bathroom but Garrett soon emerges with a zip gun and orders him to hand over the device. Suddenly the plane starts <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> bright lights shine in through the windows. When the plane touches down and Mulder gets out both Garrett and the device are gone and Mulder is missing nine minutes, having no memory of what happened. The agents visit Sharon one last time in Max's trailer and say goodbye.|$|E
25|$|At the Earth's surface, {{earthquakes}} {{manifest themselves}} by <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> sometimes {{displacement of the}} ground. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides, and occasionally volcanic activity.|$|E

25|$|<b>Shaking</b> <b>and</b> ground rupture are {{the main}} effects created by earthquakes, principally {{resulting}} in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude, {{the distance from the}} epicenter, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation. The ground-shaking is measured by ground acceleration.|$|E
25|$|While {{the great}} {{subduction}} events release much energy (around magnitude 9), that energy is {{spread over a}} large area, and largely centered near the coast. The energy of the somewhat smaller Benioff earthquakes is likewise diluted over a relatively large area. The largest intra-crustal earthquakes have about the same total energy (which is about one-hundredth of a subduction event), but since they re closer to the surface they will cause more powerful <b>shaking,</b> <b>and,</b> therefore, more damage.|$|E

25|$|The Northridge {{earthquake}} led to {{a number}} of legislative changes. Due to the large amount lost by insurance companies, most insurance companies either stopped offering or severely restricted earthquake insurance in California. In response, the California Legislature created the California Earthquake Authority (CEA), which is a publicly managed but privately funded organization that offers minimal coverage. A substantial effort was also made to reinforce freeway bridges against seismic <b>shaking,</b> <b>and</b> a law requiring water heaters to be properly strapped was passed in 1995.|$|E
25|$|The quake gave {{scientists}} {{the opportunity}} to collect {{a large amount of}} data so as to model in great detail the seismic events that took place. This data is expected to be used in a variety of ways, providing as it does unprecedented information about how buildings respond to <b>shaking,</b> <b>and</b> other effects. Gravimetric data from the quake has been used to create a model for increased warning time compared to seismic models, as gravity fields travel faster than seismic waves.|$|E
25|$|Secretive cave-spawning {{cichlids}} {{lay their}} eggs in caves, crevices, holes, or discarded mollusc shells, frequently attaching the eggs {{to the roof of}} the chamber. Examples include Pelvicachromis spp., Archocentrus spp., and Apistogramma spp. Free-swimming fry and parents communicate in captivity and in the wild. Frequently, this communication is based on body movements, such as <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> pelvic fin flicking. In addition, open- and cave-brooding parents assist in finding food resources for their fry. Multiple neotropical cichlid species perform leaf-turning and fin-digging behaviors.|$|E

25|$|Active {{systems are}} {{designed}} for three-dimensional noise cancellation. To implement an active system, low-noise fluxgate magnetometers are mounted {{at the center of}} each surface and oriented orthogonally to it. This negatively feeds a DC amplifier through a low-pass network with a slow falloff to minimize positive feedback and oscillation. Built into the system are <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> degaussing wires. Shaking wires increase the magnetic permeability, while the permanent degaussing wires are applied to all surfaces of the inner main layer to degauss the surfaces. Moreover, noise cancellation algorithms can reduce both low-frequency and high-frequency noise. Modern systems have a noise floor of around 2–3fT/Hz0.5 above 1Hz.|$|E

Soon after her release, she begged Rusty to let her die as she held a knife up to her neck. Once again hospitalized, she was given a cocktail of medications including Haldol, an anti-psychotic drug. Her condition improved immediately and she was prescribed it on her release. After that, Rusty moved the family into a small house for the sake of her health. She appeared temporarily stabilized.|$|E
25|$|Physiological effects, {{similar to}} those in other anxiety disorders, are present in social phobics. In adults, it may be tears as well as {{excessive}} sweating, nausea, difficulty breathing, <b>shaking,</b> <b>and</b> palpitations {{as a result of the}} fight-or-flight response. The walk disturbance (where a person is so worried about how they walk that they may lose balance) may appear, especially when passing a group of people. Blushing is commonly exhibited by individuals suffering from social phobia. These visible symptoms further reinforce the anxiety in the presence of others. A 2006 study found that the area of the brain called the amygdala, part of the limbic system, is hyperactive when patients are shown threatening faces or confronted with frightening situations.|$|E
