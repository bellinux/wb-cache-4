5|$|The park's woods are {{important}} because they provide shelter for {{a large number of}} animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are coniferous and deciduous woods. The deciduous European beech forests are common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on the dryer Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves {{take a long time to}} decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with spruces, <b>Swiss</b> <b>stone</b> <b>pines,</b> and more rarely silver firs.|$|R

40|$|In the Baikal Region, {{there is}} no phenological {{isolation}} between Siberian <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> (P. sibirica Du Tour) and Siberian dwarf <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> (P. pumila (Pall.) Regel) since the timing of their 'flowering' coincides. Morphologically intermediate individuals, supposedly natural hybrids,occur not very often. In the west half of Stanovoye upland area four regions were investigated: Barguzinskiy, Baikalskiy, Verchneangarskiy and the Severo-Myiskiy mountain ridges. Interspecific natural hybridization was found {{to take place in}} several overlapping regions of the species' ranges; however there are some differences in frequency of natural hybrid occurrence between regions as well as within each region. Great numbers of natural hybrids are found only in a specific habitat which occurs rarely and occupies a relatively small area. At the north-east coast of Lake Baikal the lakeside zone is occupied by Siberian <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> forests with moderate participation of Siberian dwarf <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> in the undergrowth. The natural hybrid are widespread everywhere. The ratio of fructiferous Siberian <b>stone</b> <b>pine,</b> Siberian dwarf <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> and natural hybrid was found to be approximately 300 : 10 : 1. About 90 % of the examined natural hybrids took an intermediate position between the two parental species by most features (structure of needles, shoots, and crown), i. e. representing putatively the first generation hybrids. Therefore, in contrast to the parental species they are subjected to the destructive effect of snowbreak (broken off or dislocated from part of the root system). Like the Siberian dwarf <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> the natural hybrid has specific root sources forming from latent buds. Therefore, the hybrids are not subjected to ageing, as well as have no internal limitation of age and size. Siberian dwarf <b>stone</b> <b>pine,</b> Siberian <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> and their natural hybrid grow together in the Upper Angara delta in the bog regions. In the most productive sites the ratio of fructiferous Siberian dwarf <b>stone</b> <b>pine,</b> Siberian <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> and natural hybrid amounts approximately to 60 : 3 : 1. The ratio of fructiferous Siberian dwarf <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> and natural hybrid reaches about 20 : 1 in the less productive sites where Siberian <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> is sterile. Analysis of cone structure showed that the natural hybrid have substantially increased in comparison with the species' mortality and aplasia of reproductive structures at all stages of the generative cycle, from differentiation of the seed-bearing scales to differentiation of the embryo. The portion of the ovules, which develop into the valuable seed with differentiated embryo, amounted in Siberian dwarf <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> to 69 %, in Siberian <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> to 44 %, and in natural hybrid to 25 %. Thus, the fertility of natural hybrid in the Upper Angara Delta substantially decreased in comparison with the pure species; however, it was demonstrated that natural hybridization between Siberian dwarf <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> and Siberian <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> species occurred. </span...|$|R

40|$|A {{putative}} interspecific hybridization in Pinaceae {{family was}} investigated. Very rarely the physiological methods were involved in hybridization processes that occurs in the hybrid zones. It {{is well known}} that in most gymnosperms, the plastid genome is inherited from the paternal component while the mitochondrion is inherited from the maternal one. Therefore functioning pattern of organelles in the hybrid plant can suggest parent, from which they were inherited. The aim {{of this study was to}} indirectly establish the inheritance energy-transducing organelles (mitochondria, chloroplast) according to their functioning. Current year needles from Siberian Stone Pine (Pinus sibirica Du Tour) and Japanese <b>Stone</b> <b>Pine</b> (Pinus pumila (Pall.)  Regel) as parent species and their putative hybrids were collected from Baikal Region.  The photosynthesis rate was determined by using the spectrophotometer. The study of emission CO 2 under dark respiration of needle was conducted with laser optical-acoustic gasanalyzer.  The quantity was measured at 1, 2  and 3 hour after experiment start. The rate of the photoreduction ferricyanide potassium was characterized by the primary photochemical processes activity at the level of photosystem II. Comparison of pure species was shown that Japanese <b>Stone</b> <b>Pine</b> had higher functional activity of chloroplast as compared with Siberian <b>Stone</b> <b>Pine</b> in spite of the fact that they are growing in similar environment conditions.  Two of three analyzed hybrids had decreased activity of their chloroplasts. Unfortunately, in this case we can't conclude if the chloroplasts were inherited from Siberian <b>Stone</b> <b>Pine</b> or from Japanese <b>Stone</b> <b>Pine.</b> Chloroplast activity of the third hybrid was approximately similar to that of Japanese <b>Stone</b> <b>Pine</b> suggesting that its chloroplasts were inherited from this parent.  Consequently, the Siberian <b>Stone</b> <b>Pine</b> and the Japanese <b>Stone</b> <b>Pine</b> were maternal and paternal, respectively parents of the hybrid. Compared to the Siberian <b>Stone</b> <b>Pine,</b> the Japanese Stone Pine had higher dark respiration rate. The hybrid respiration rate was similar to that of the Japanese <b>Stone</b> <b>Pine</b> suggesting that the hybrid inherited mitochondria from this species. Our findings indicated that the P.  pumila exhibited particular ecological plasticity and this phenomenon is attributable to its high potential activity of photosynthetic and respiratory processes.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of seed {{dispersal}} through the European nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes) on the genetic structure of <b>Swiss</b> <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus cembra). The corvid bird deposits several thousands of stone pine seeds annually in the soil as a future food resource. Since not all caches are recovered, this bird behaviour often leads {{to the establishment of}} <b>Swiss</b> <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> seedlings. The combination of wind pollination with this bird-mediated seed dispersal can be expected to greatly shape the spatial distribution of genotypes and the genetic diversity within and among <b>Swiss</b> <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> populations. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate gene flow patterns, together with their effects on spatial genetic structure (SGS) and, thus, inbreeding probabilities in an exemplary P. cembra population. Furthermore, potential effects of inbreeding on offspring fitness were analysed, hypothesizing that rates of inbreeding and subsequent cumulative inbreeding depression are higher in small and patchily distributed than in large and continuous P. cembra populations. Molecular genetic results from the study population Rautialp show that both pollen and seed dispersal occur across the entire stand, supporting the assumption of extensive gene flow through far-ranging vectors like wind and birds. Nevertheless, we also found strong spatial autocorrelation of individuals within the population. This suggests that seed dispersal through nutcrackers occurs in a kin-structured manner, which leads to the establishment of SGS – especially in areas where tree density is low and seed shadows overlap less than in dense areas of the stand. The second part of the study shows that inbreeding rates were higher in small and peripheral than in large and continuous P. cembra populations, causing a reduction in offspring fitness. Taken together, this study suggests that small and isolated <b>Swiss</b> <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> populations might be especially vulnerable to ongoing and future environmental changes...|$|E

40|$|<b>Stone</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus pinea L.) {{has been}} widely {{introduced}} for afforestation in Mediterranean areas. Despite its wide distribution and its presence since ancient time, it is mostly considered as non-native to the Italian peninsula. Plantation of non-native species may have a strong impact on the soil microbial community and, consequently, on nutrient cycling and soil functions. The effect of <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> on soil microbial community structure and biomass, as revealed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and fungal biomass indicators, was investigated in two Mediterranean areas in south Italy, where the climax tree species was holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) and some patches were afforested with <b>stone</b> <b>pine.</b> We studied soils from two sites with different parent material, volcanic lava and limestone (calcareous soil). The soil pH range was wider in the calcareous than in the volcanic soils. At both sites, the soils under <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> had lower pH and higher organic matter content than under holm oak. Microbial biomass was, on average, 1. 3 - 1. 4 fold higher in the soils under holm oak than under <b>stone</b> <b>pine.</b> The PLFA composition was different in soils under <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> compared with holm oak, while the changes in PLEA composition induced by the different tree species were comparable at the two sites. The changes in the PLFA composition were significantly correlated to soil pH and relative concentrations of PLFA indicators (mol%) previously demonstrated to indicate pH effects were also correlated to pH. Thus, both in the volcanic and the calcareous soils, <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> plantation affected soil microbial community structure and the mechanism for this change appeared to be soil pH changes.

Here, we screened 25 populations of <b>Swiss</b> <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus cembra L.) from the Carpathians and the Alps, using a set of ten microsatellite primers to assess the relative conservation value of populations sampled in Polish and Slovak Tatra National Parks, where potential extinction risk is the highest within the Carpathian range. Although endangered, with small and fragmented populations, P. cembra in the Tatra Mts. shows high levels of allelic richness (AR = 5. 0) and observed heterozygosity (H (o) = 0. 554). Our results suggest that anthropogenic habitat fragmentation has had little impact on DNA variation of <b>Swiss</b> <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> in the Tatra Mts.

40|$|As {{study area}} we {{selected}} the glacier foreland of Morteratsch (approx. 1900 – 2100 m a. s. l.) near Pontresina {{northwest of the}} Bernina pass, Upper Engadine, Grisons (Switzerland). The {{aim of this study}} is a multimethodological approach using floristic inventories, vegetation and soil mapping of the pro-glacial area in order to detect crucial parameters controlling plant resettlement in recently deglaciated areas as related to time, local microtopography and soil development. The following methodological approaches were included in this study: (i) floristic relevees along a chronosequence covering 134 years (1857 – 1990); (ii) dendrochronological data on tree establishment, collected on a grid with a mesh width of 40 m in the area, which became ice-free between 1857 and 1980; (iii) vegetation mapping; (iv) soil analyses including physical and chemical properties of 11 typical profiles; (v) soil mapping and (vi) data evaluation using GIS. Retreating glaciers successively expose mineral substrates that are colonised within a few years by vascular plants, mosses, lichens and soil biota. With increasing plant cover, also the abundance of soil organic matter increases. At first sight, the large-scale patterns of vegetation and soil seem to be driven by the time since deglaciation, whereas the small scale patterns may appear chaotic since they depend on local site conditions, which may change dramatically over short distances. The large-scale pattern seems to develop as follows. About 7 years after deglaciation the first pioneer plants establish themselves and form after an additional 20 years period the Epilobietum fleischeri community, which today dominates the recently deglaciated areas, but may be found in patches more or less on the whole pro-glacial area. By contrast, the first elements of the short living Oxyrietum digynae community appear approximately 10 years after deglaciation and persist for only about 30 years. Dendrochronology showed that the first European larch and <b>Swiss</b> <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> trees established themselves 15 and 31 years, respectively, after deglaciation. Surprisingly, on the study area, <b>Swiss</b> <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> is about twice as frequent as the typical pioneer species European larch (88 stems per ha vs. 45 stems per ha), despite the fact that larch starts earlier and grows faster than <b>Swiss</b> <b>stone</b> <b>pine</b> (annual height increment: 21 cm vs. 8 cm). Up-to-now, however, nowhere in the 150 -year-old glacier foreland a near-to-mature larch-Swiss stone pine forest can be found. Besides large-scale factors such as time since deglaciation, topography and disturbance (floods, rockfalls, avalanches), also small-scale factors such as grain size and water content of the substrate, micro-relief and micro-climate seem to be crucial for the development of both vegetation and soil. Time since deglaciation and a straightforward single-pathway succession model are clearly not sufficient for understanding the small-scale patterns of succession. A non-linear succession model with different starting points and different pathways of potential primary successions for the different ecological niches is more promising for describing accurately the spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics of the pro-glacial area of Morteratsch...|$|E
