500|$|Picken's Hole at the {{southern}} end of Crook Peak is considered to be of importance because of its clear, well-stratified sequence of deposits and faunas, all dating from within the Devensian. The cave is [...] below the plateau and [...] above the valley floor. It is named after M.J. Picken who found teeth in earth thrown out of their sets in the area by badgers. A large number of Middle Palaeolithic artefacts, and two Neanderthal teeth dated to about 55,000 years BP, have been recovered from the cave. Faunal deposits of spotted hyena, lion, Arctic fox, mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, reindeer, <b>suslik</b> and northern vole (Microtus oeconomus) from approximately 35,000 BP have also been recovered.|$|E
5000|$|Some Eurasian {{species are}} {{sometimes}} called susliks (or sousliks). This {{name comes from}} Russian суслик, <b>suslik.</b> In some languages, a derivative of the name is in common usage, for example suseł in Polish. The scientific name of this genus means [...] "seed-lovers".|$|E
50|$|Steppes of the Southern Urals are {{dominated}} by hares and rodents such as gophers, <b>susliks</b> and jerboa. There are many birds of prey such as lesser kestrel and buzzards. The animals of the Polar Ural are characteristic of the tundra and include fox, lemming and reindeer. The birds of those areas include rough-legged buzzard, snowy owl and rock ptarmigan.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{not clear}} where the Marmotini originated.

Unfortunately, the fossil record of the [...] "true" [...] ground squirrels is less well known, beginning only in the mid-Miocene, when modern <b>susliks</b> and prairie dogs are known to have inhabited their present-day range already.|$|R

5000|$|The ground {{squirrels}} {{are members}} of the squirrel family of rodents (Sciuridae) which generally live on or in the ground, rather than trees. The term is most often used for the medium-sized ground squirrels, as the larger ones are more commonly known as marmots (genus Marmota) or prairie dogs, while the smaller and less bushy-tailed ground squirrels tend to be known as chipmunks. Together, they make up the [...] "marmot tribe" [...] of squirrels, Marmotini, and the large and mainly ground squirrel subfamily Xerinae, and containing six living genera. Well-known members of this largely Holarctic group are the marmots (Marmota), including the American groundhog, the chipmunks, the <b>susliks</b> (Spermophilus), and the prairie dogs (Cynomys). They are highly variable in size and habitus, but most are remarkably able to rise up on their hind legs and stand fully erect comfortably for prolonged periods. They also tend to be far more gregarious than other squirrels, and many live in colonies with complex social structures. Most Marmotini are rather short-tailed and large squirrels, and the alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) is the largest living member of the Sciuridae, at 53-73 cm in length and weighing 5-8 kg.|$|R
40|$|Using the {{experiments}} on cats, mice, rats, the lectrophysiological {{activity of the}} central nervous systems, the conditionally-reflector activity and the vegetative processes under {{the conditions of the}} different forms of the hypoxic states, and during the barometric chamber-training. The investigations on the marmots and <b>susliks</b> during the natural hibernation have been performed. The dynamics of the main vegetative indicators of the organism (breathing, cardium activity, microcirculation, acid-base state) has the expressed individual oscillations within the limits wide enough under the conditions of the oxygen hunger. It indicates of the multivariant principle of adaptation, based on the position, that the useful result and as the final result, the time of survival of the given animal, is being ensured by not uniform inclusion in the adapting act of the definite physiological systems, preserving the optimum level of the metabolism of each individual. The sharp increase of the animals resistance to the hypoxic effects, arising at the natural physiological conditions and states (the pregnancy, dormancy and etc.), allows to formulate a presentation about the physiological hypoxia phenomenon presence, having the adapting importance. The degree of variations of the primary and secondary components of the CNS called potentials is the more reliable criterion of evaluation of the brain cortex, subcortical structures and organism as a whole.

For the first time, the species composition of the basic vegetative fooders kinds in the region and the sexual dimorphism in the seasons of variation of food and the consumption of the fat reserves have been revealed; the marking behavior of the long-tailed <b>suslik</b> in the marriage period has been desribed.
