It consisted of nineteen different elements that could be assembled into any desired seating configuration.|$|E

50|$|Molded plywood is {{the term}} for two- or three-dimensionally shaped {{products}} from multiple veneer layers that are glued together through heat and pressure in a pressing tool. The veneer layers are arranged crosswise at an angle of 90 degrees. Molded wood is used for flat furniture components such as seats, backrests and seat shells. When the veneer layers are arranged in the same direction, it is called laminated wood. It is used for armrests and chair frames. After pressing, the blanks are processed mechanically. A particular feature {{is the ability to}} produce different variations of shapes from the blanks. Due to its immense strength and low weight, molded wood is particularly suitable for interior decoration, <b>seating</b> <b>furniture,</b> bed slats, skateboards and vehicle construction.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} used <b>seating</b> <b>furniture</b> in the dynastic {{period was}} the stool, {{which was used}} throughout Egyptian society, from the royal family down to ordinary citizens. Various different designs were used, including stools with four vertical legs, and others with crossed splayed legs; almost all had rectangular seats, however. Examples include the workman's stool, a simple three legged structure with a concave seat, designed for comfort during labour, and the much more ornate folding stool, with crossed folding legs, which were decorated with carved duck heads and ivory, and had hinges made of bronze. Full chairs were much rarer in early Egypt, being limited to only wealthy and high ranking people, and seen as a status symbol; they did not reach ordinary households until the eighteenth dynasty. Early examples were formed by adding a straight back to a stool, while later chairs had an inclined back. Other furniture types in ancient Egypt include tables, which are heavily represented in art, but almost nonexistent as preserved items - perhaps because they were placed outside tombs rather than within, as well as beds and storage chests.|$|E

5000|$|A stool {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} forms of <b>seat</b> <b>furniture.</b> It bears many similarities to a chair. It consists of a single seat, for one person, without back or armrests (in early stools), on a base of either three or four legs. A stool is generally distinguished from chairs by their lack of arms and a back. Variants exist with one, two or five legs and these various stools are referred to by some people as [...] "backless chairs". Some modern stools have backs.|$|R

40|$|For optimal use and {{function}} in the public interior evaluation of <b>seating</b> <b>furniture</b> is {{important in terms of}} typology, ergonomics, safety, quality of design, used materials, ecology and other properties. The aim is to adjust the dimensional requirements of the <b>seating</b> <b>furniture</b> for public interior {{to meet the needs of}} the current population and reflect the proportional changes in the human body over the last decades. Due to the ageing of population and growing number of people with movement and physiological limitations (which also include the elderly), it will become, in near future, more topical need to modify the rules related to <b>seating</b> <b>furniture</b> that is used in public space. Particularly, in the term of simple and non-discriminatory sitting down and standing up. Proposal to change standards is based on the analysis of used values, the results of the current anthropometrical survey and addition of parameters that were processed by using ergonomic software. In most of the activities related to the seating there is an interaction with the surrounding furniture. Based on this assumption arise the importance of connection between <b>seating</b> <b>furniture</b> and reaching distance of the person sitting on it. Ranges are in the computer simulation divided according to intensity - static, dynamic and comfortable (with the preservation of the natural physiological limitations of joints). The resulting values of simulations can be defined distances suitable for placing objects near <b>seating</b> <b>furniture</b> to ensure the possibility of full utilization.

40|$|From {{the early}} days of {{tapestry}} weaving in Western Europe, production included tapestries of smaller dimension like cushions and bank covers. During the 14 th and 15 th centuries they often formed part of a tapestry suite including bed- and wall-hangings. <b>Seat</b> <b>furniture</b> with tapestry coverings nailed to the frame appeared around 1550. In the 17 th century furniture tapestries numbers increased further, especially in the Netherlands, comprising covers for cushions, beds, <b>seat</b> <b>furniture,</b> table carpets and chimney valances, and produced in the many local workshops. In France however, tapestries were then almost exclusively used as wall-hangings. Only circa 1700 did furniture tapestries become more popular there, and soon after 1750 French production knew its first hey-day, with important workshops situated in Paris, Beauvais and Aubusson. The economic crisis following the French revolution had severe repercussions for all tapestry manufactories. Shortly after Napoleon became Emperor, the former royal workshops of the Gobelins and Beauvais started weaving furniture tapestries for the imperial residences, which practice continued under subsequent regimes. Large scale production of furniture tapestries in the private looms of Aubusson flourished after 1860. Around the same time tapestry manufactories (re) opened in Belgium at Ingelmunster, Mechelen and Brussels. Throughout the centuries the popularity of furniture tapestry may have fluctuated, but its solidity and richness of materials, its iconography and aristocratic status were always appreciated.
