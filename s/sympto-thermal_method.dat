As Consultant Obstetrician/Gynaecologist at Lusaka UTH, she became a national tutor in the <b>sympto-thermal</b> <b>method</b> of family planning. Concerned with hospital overcrowding and high post-natal mortality, she strove to reduce maternal mortality by half in the 1990s, {{in accordance with the}} [...] "Health for All" [...] Alma Ata Declaration (1978). In this, she was strongly supported by the Government of Zambia, and attracted funding from Ireland's then-emerging Official Development Assistance.|$|E
40|$|Calendar rhythm is in {{the same}} range of {{effectiveness}} as modern NFP. When calendar rhythm studies are standardized, the projected rhythm pregnancy rates, 15. 0 and 18. 5 are within the range of modern NFP methods. Unplanned pregnancy rates for the modern NFP methods range between 10 and 20 pregnancies per 100 women per year. Multivariate analysis comparing <b>sympto-thermal</b> and ovulation <b>method</b> unplanned pregnancy rates shows an ST life table rate of 10. 2 + 2. 5 and an OM rate of 16. 0 + 3. 3. NFP is as effective as barrier methods of birth spacing and can be used very effectively to avoid pregnancy (less than 5 pregnancies per 100 women per year) if the rules are followed. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the satisfaction among subfertile women of a fertility awareness-based approach, including hormonal therapy to achieve a pregnancy by natural conception. Eighty four women attending a natural fertility service completed a postal questionnaire exploring (1) the acceptability of the <b>sympto-thermal</b> <b>method</b> and (2) the acceptability of using hormone support. Acceptability rates for the fertility charting, clinical service and clinical care were 64. 9 - 91. 6 %. Acceptability rates were higher in women who did conceive or had experienced past recurrent miscarriages. Taking hormonal luteal support, by any method, was more acceptable for women over 35 years compared to those under 35 years (100 % vs. 69. 4 %, p = 0. 014). Vaginal pessaries were the preferred route of administration. The use of a fertility awareness-based method appears to be acceptable amongst subfertile women intending to conceive naturally. Most women using such a method for conception would be open to the use of hormonal support during the fertility cycle or early pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|In 2008, {{a survey}} {{concerning}} {{the performance of}} natural regulation of conception and its potential influence on family life and spousal relations was conducted {{among members of the}} institute for natural regulation of conception (INER), a group of declared users and teachers of the method. Questionnaires were mailed to 1131 members in Germany, Austria, Switzer-land, and Italy (region of Alto Adige). The questionnaires contained 14 questions with 37 items, respectively. The return rate was 43. 5 %. The results support earlier publications indicating that natural familiy planning (NFP) is associated with positive spousal relationships and family stability. NFP, here specifically the <b>sympto-thermal</b> <b>method</b> after J. Rötzer, improves the communication and the mutual respect between the spouses. It is associated with a low divorce rate (3 %). This rate is not only associated with the religious practice but may be a consequence of living this method per se. Surprisingly, periodical continence is regarded as beneficial by a majority of respondents, and it seems to keep the joy in sexuality maintained. Since the method is free of any undesirable side effects, and is associated with a favourable Pearl Index, it should become known on a broader base...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{fertility}} awareness-based methods (FABMs) {{of family}} planning have been offered as alternative methods {{of family planning}}. Billings Ovulation Method, the Creighton Model, and the Symptothermal Method are the more widely used FABMs and can be more narrowly defined as natural family planning. The first 2 methods {{are based on the}} examination of cervical secretions to assess fertility. The <b>Sympto-thermal</b> <b>Method</b> combines characteristics of cervical secretions, basal body temperature, and historical cycle data to determine fertility. FABMs also include the more recently developed Standard Days Method and TwoDays Method. All are distinct from the more traditional rhythm and basal body temperature methods alone. Although these older methods are not highly effective, modern FABMs have typical-use unintended pregnancy rates of 1 % to 3 % in both industrialized and nonindustrialized nations. Studies suggest that in the United States physician knowledge of FABMs is frequently incomplete. We review the available evidence about the effectiveness for preventing unintended pregnancy, prognostic social de-mographics of users of the methods, and social outcomes related to FABMs, all of which suggest that family physicians can offer modern FABMs as effective means of family planning. We also provide sug-gestions about useful educational and instructional resources for family physicians and their patients. (J Am Board Fam Med 2009; 22 : 147 – 157. ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{essential}} {{to understand what is}} meant by natural family planning in order to realize why it produces so many benefits to the marriage. In general, Natural Family Planning (NFP) is defined as methods for achieving or postponing pregnancy that are based on observations of naturally occurring signs in the woman’s body that inform her of the fertile and infertile phases of her cycle. Authentic Natural Family Planning never interferes with the transmission of life; its sincere openness to the Will of God and respect for life is its most vital virtue. Various natural methods are being taught throughout the world that respect the natural law and are accepted by most cultures and religions. The Ovulation Method (OM) of Natural Family Planning is at present the most widely used method because it is the easiest to learn and simplest to follow. The NFP survey participants in the following study were generally practicing the Ovulation Method. This Method is neither the old “Rhythm ” method nor the “Temperature” or <b>Sympto-thermal</b> <b>method.</b> It is based on the simple recognition of natural signs of fertility that appear for a few days during the woman’s fertile cycle. It {{is important to recognize that}} a woman is only fertile for approximately 100 hours per cycle during her reproductiv...|$|E
