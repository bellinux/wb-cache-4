An {{irreversible}} <b>solar</b> powered <b>absorption</b> {{refrigeration system}} is put forward, in which finite-rate heat transfer with the convection mode from the solar collector to the absorption refrigerator and the radiation-convection heat loss from the solar collector to the ambient, the internal irreversibility inside the working fluid {{are taken into}} account. On the basis of thermodynamic analysis and log mean temperature difference (LMTD) methods, the expression between the overall coefficient of performance (COP) of the <b>solar</b> powered <b>absorption</b> refrigeration system and the operating temperature of the solar collector is derived. The influences of heat loss of the solar collector, the irreversibility inside the working fluid, the isobaric temperature ratio, the ratio of heat-transfer coefficients on the optimal performance characteristic of the <b>solar</b> powered <b>absorption</b> refrigeration system are revealed.
