30|$|Microbiological {{quality of}} water was {{determined}} using most probable number (MPN) methods (International Organization for Standardization, 2000). Groundwater samples were analysed for total coliform bacteria, faecal coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli and faecal streptococci. The MPN method {{was used to}} determine the presence of gas producing lactose fermenters and MPN of coliforms present in 100  mL of water. After 24  h of incubation at 37  °C in Lauryl Sulphate Tryptose Broth, tubes with turbidity and gas production were recorded as total coliform bacteria and a loopful of culture from the positive tubes was transferred into EC broth. Tubes with turbidity and gas production were recorded as faecal coliform bacteria after 24  h of incubation at 44.5  +  0.5  °C. From the positive tubes of EC broth, a loopful of culture was streaked on Eosine methylene blue agar (EMB), and colonies showing metallic sheen were recorded as presumptive E. coli. Further, typical colonies on EMB agar were purified and subjected to IMViC tests and confirmed as E. coli. Pour plate technique using Kenner Faecal agar was employed for the estimation of faecal streptococcal count, and typical colonies were counted after incubation at 37  °C for 48  h and expressed as colony forming unit (CFU) per ml or g of the sample. Salmonella was confirmed following standard procedures (AOAC 1998). Salmonella was detected by pre-enrichment in lactose broth, selective enrichment in tetrathionate broth and <b>selenite</b> <b>cysteine</b> <b>broth,</b> followed by selective plating on Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate agar and Bismuth sulphite agar. Typical colonies were purified them subjected to biochemical tests and finally confirmed serologically using poly ‘O’ and poly ‘H’ antisera (AOAC 1998).|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 60 samples (20 each of turkey meat, faeces and cloacal swab samples) {{collected}} from different sources {{were subjected to}} cultural and PCR methods {{for the presence of}} Salmonella and Salmonella enteritidis. Primers for invA and sefA gene were used for Salmonella and S. enteritidis respectively. Out of 60 samples, 49 were positive for Salmonella spp. i. e. turkey meat- 14 (70 %), turkey cloacal swabs- 17 (85 %), turkey faeces- 18 (90 %) by PCR methods, whereas 43 were positive by cultural method i. e. turkey meat- 12 (60 %), turkey cloacal swabs- 15 (75 %), turkey faeces- 16 (80 %). Out of 49 positive for Salmonella by PCR method, 36 (turkey meat- 11, turkey cloacal swabs- 13, turkey faeces- 12) were positive for S. enteritidis.

40|$|Abstract Background Salmonella are {{the major}} {{pathogenic}} bacteria in humans {{as well as in}} animals. Salmonella species are leading causes of acute gastroenteritis in several countries and salmonellosis remains an important public health problem worldwide, particularly in the developing countries. The situation is more aggravated by the ever increasing rate of antimicrobial resistance strains. Cattle have been implicated as a source of human infection with antimicrobial resistant Salmonella through direct contact with livestock and through the isolation of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella from raw milk, cheddar cheese, and hamburger meat traced to dairy farms. Despiite the presence of many studies on the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Salmonella in Ethiopia, nothing has been said on the degree of the situation among apparently healthy lactating cows and in contact humans. Hence this study was conducted to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance pattern of Salmonella isolates from lactating cows and in contact humans in dairy farms of Addis Ababa. Methods a cross sectional study was conducted in Addis Ababa by collecting milk and faecal samples from lactating cows and stool samples from humans working in dairy farms. Samples were pre-enriched in buffered peptone water followed by selective enrichment using <b>selenite</b> <b>cysteine</b> and Rapaport-Vassilidis <b>broths.</b> Isolation and identification was made by inoculating the selectively enriched sample on to Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate agar followed by confirmation of presumptive colonies using different biochemical tests. The Kibry Bauer disk diffusion method was used for antimicrobial sensitivity testing. Results 10. 7 % (21 / 195) of cows and 13. 6 % (3 / 22) of the human subjects sheded Salmonella. 83 % resistance to two or more antimicrobials and 100 % resistance to ampicillin were observed. Most of the isolates were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Conclusion High proportion of Salmonella isolates developed resistance to the commonly prescribed antimicrobials and this may be a considerable risk in the treatment of clinical cases. So, wise use of antimicrobials must be practiced to combat the ever increasing situation of antimicrobial resistance. </p...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. Brain heart {{infusion}} <b>cysteine</b> <b>broth,</b> {{with and}} without Panmede @ (a papain digest of ox liver) and Fastidious Anaerobe Broth, {{with and without}} Liquoid, were compared by inoculating the broths with blood collected from each of 51 patients, 2 min after dental extraction. Bacteraemia caused by viridans streptococci or oral non-sporing anaerobes or both was detected in 39 patients (76 %). Detection of bacteraemia caused by viridans streptococci and anaerobes was more rapidly achieved {{by the addition of}} Panmede to brain heart infusion broth. Significantly more cases of bacteraemia caused by viridans streptococci were detected by use of the Panmede-containing medium than by use of Fastidious Anaerobe Broth after incubation of the broths for only 1 day. Use of brain heart infusion <b>cysteine</b> <b>broth</b> with and without Panmede, and Fastidious Anaerobe Broth permitted detection of bacteraemia caused by viridans streptococci in 26, 11 and 22 patients respectively during incubation for 2 weeks. Bacteraemia caused by anaerobes was detected by use of these three media in 24, 13 and 23 patients respectively. The addition of Liquoid to Fastidious Anaerobe Broth had no significant effect on the detection of bacteraemia caused by viridans streptococci or anaerobes. The Panmede-containing blood-culture medium should be a useful anaerobic broth in the investigation of patients with suspected endocar-ditis, because viridans streptococci are also rapidly detected...|$|R
40|$|Panmede, a papain digest of ox liver, {{added to}} brain heart {{infusion}} <b>cysteine</b> <b>broth</b> improved the recovery of non-sporing anaerobes from simulated blood cultures where human blood was added to each broth. The {{brain heart infusion}} <b>broth</b> containing both <b>cysteine</b> and Panmede supported the best isolation of non-sporing anaerobes during the first 48 h incubation compared with the four commercial media tested in parallel. Good recovery of anaerobes during the first 24 h was obtained with the brain heart infusion <b>broth</b> supplemented with <b>cysteine</b> and Panmede, fastidious anaerobe broth and Brewer's thioglycollate from Southern Group Laboratories but not from Thiol medium and the other type of Brewer's thioglycollate medium tested...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{liquid media}} were {{compared}} under standard conditions {{for their ability}} to support the growth of Legionella pneumophila. Modified gonococcal-ferric <b>cysteine</b> <b>broth</b> (without sodium chloride) supplemented with 1 % yeast extract yielded the best overall growth of the one strain of L. pneumophila examined. Growth rates were independent of pH changes which occurred during incubation. The growth rates of 10 different strains of L. pneumophila were compared in this medium. There appeared to be little difference in the growth rates of strains passaged frequently or infrequently, or between environmental and clinical isolates. Moderate aeration resulted in a faster growth rate and in approximately a 1 log 10 higher final cell concentration as compared to a static broth culture. These experiments demonstrate that there are moderate to marked differences among the various media described in the literature and that no liquid medium yet developed supports rapid growth of L. pneumophila incubated without shaking...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{importance}} of the health of red meat, poultry and eggs in human nutrition is very high. One {{of the factors that}} jeopardize the health of poultry food products is the bacterial family of Enterobacteriaceae, especially Salmonella. The aim {{of this study was to}} detect pathogenic genes in Salmonella infectious bacteria isolated from stool specimens using the multiple PCR assay. Materials and Methods: Selective and specific media for isolation of Salmonella were used. Primary isolation was carried out using Peptone water, Rapaport, <b>selenite</b> <b>cysteine,</b> MacConky agar and xylose-lysine deoxycholate agar. To confirm the diagnosis, biochemical tests including TSI, urea, endodontic, and citrate were used. The Salmonella Polyvalent Kit was used to determine Salmonella groups and mgtC, spi 4 R, agfA, invE/A and ttrC genes were studied in 60 samples by the multiple PCR method. Results: The results showed that all samples had 2 genes mgtC and ttrC, and none of the samples showed resistance to cefepime. Of the 60 samples of Salmonella, none were resistant to cefepime and ceftriaxone; 38. 8 of the samples were resistant to amoxicillin, 53 to erythromycin and 38. 3 to sulfamethoxazole. Conclusion: It can be concluded that cefepime is the best selective drug for the treatment of Salmonella infections. Identification and validation of genes in the region's bacteria can play a role in the broad epidemiological examination, antibiotic resistance, vaccine production, level of virulence, prevention and treatment. Also, evaluation of these genes in the samples for their virulence index is very important...|$|R

The rates of reduction of Se(IV) by cysteine were measured in deaerated NaCl solutions and natural waters {{as a function of}} pH (4. 0 – 9. 0), temperature (10 – 40 C), and ionic strength (0. 01 – 1. 0 M). Environmental significance of the results and the importance of abiotic vs biotic reactions are also briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-four human bifidobacterial strains were {{analysed}} for cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) using a salt aggregation test (SAT) and a Congo red binding (CRB) assay. Three strains {{were selected for}} a systematic study on the CSH and biofilm formation: Bifidobacterium breve 46, Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis 8 : 8 and a reference strain B. animalis ssp. lactis JCM 10602. CRB of the B. breve 46 and B. animalis ssp. lactis JCM 10602 was significantly enhanced (P < 0. 05) when grown in deMan-Rogosa-Sharpe <b>cysteine</b> (MRSC) <b>broth</b> supplemented with taurocholic acid (TA) or native porcine bile (PB). An enhanced CSH of the strains grown with PB and gastric mucin correlated with an increased mucin binding and an enhanced biofilm formation in prebiotic oligosaccharide-supplemented cultures. The three strains showed late bile-induced biofilm (72 h) under an anaerobic growth condition, and both B. animalis ssp. lactis strains showed a late bile-induced biofilm formation under aerobic conditions shown by crystal violet staining. These two strains were thus considered to be oxygen tolerant and more robust. Furthermore, enhanced biofilm formation of these robust bifidobacterial strains {{in the presence of}} prebiotics may allow for strong colonisation in the gastrointestinal tract when administered to in vivo models as a "synbiotic supplement"...|$|R
40|$|Nutritional variant streptococci {{identified}} as pyridoxal-dependent Streptococcus mitior (mitis) account for 5 to 6 % of streptococcal endocarditis {{and may be}} a cause of "culture-negative" endocarditis. Hence, growth of three variant strains in 11 commercial blood culture broths was compared to that in fresh heart infusion broth. For simulation of clinical specimens, culture bottles were injected with 5 ml of human blood, inoculated with approximately 500 colony-forming units (CFU) per bottle, and monitored for 7 days with Gram stains and viable counts. Only Thiol broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) supported growth without blood at this low inoculum. In media containing blood, maximal growth of 10 (9) CFU/ml was reached within 2 days of incubation, and heavy turbidity was consistently observed in only heart infusion broth, Thiol broth, and media supplemented with pyridoxal hydrochloride. Columbia broth (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) with increased <b>cysteine,</b> thioglycollate <b>broth,</b> and one brain heart infusion broth produced moderate growth (1 x 10 (8) to 5 x 10 (8) CFU/ml), whereas Columbia broth, another brain heart infusion broth, and two brands of tryptic soy broth showed fair growth (1 x 10 (7) to 4 x 10 (7) CFU/ml). The poor growth (1 x 10 (6) to 3 x 10 (6) CFU/ml) observed in three other brands of tryptic soy broth was often not apparent macroscopically or by Gram stain. Furthermore, on growth occurred in 40 % of tryptic soy broth cultures inoculated with 50 CFU. Therefore, to ensure isolation of these variant streptococci from clinical blood cultures, a medium containing thiol compounds or supplemented with pyridoxal should be used. Subcultures should be made within 2 days of incubation to blood agar enriched with pyridoxal or containing a Staphylococcus sp. streak for satellitism...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{isolated}} and identified strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that are potential bacteriocin producers from rocket salad samples acquired in São Paulo, SP, Brazil. Using the PCR-ARDRA method, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MKO 2 R was identified and characterized as the only bacter-iocinogenic among 12 strains initially isolated. {{the analysis of the}} antimicrobial peptide produced by MK 02 R revealed the presence of nisin variant, a well-known lantibiotic, {{and one of the most}} studied and important antimicrobial peptides known today. the bacteriocin MK 02 R showed heat stability for 1 h at 60 degrees C and 100 degrees C and it was inactivated by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. the antimicrobial activity did not change with pH adjustment between 2. 0 and 9. 0 and the production was stimulated by the addition of 0. 5 and 1. 0 % <b>cysteine</b> in MRS <b>broth</b> at 37 degrees C. Bacteriocin MK 0 R inhibited the growth of Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus del brueckii, Lb. sakei subsp. sakei, Listeria innocua and Listeria monocytogenes from different serological groups. Low levels of adsorption of bacteriocin MK 0 R were detected in the cell surface of the producer cells suggesting that bacteriocin MK 0 R remains bound to the outer surface and that it is released when the pH of the environment increases. the chromatographic studies and the genetic tests using primers nisF and nisR related to specific genes of nisin production confirmed that the antimicrobial MKO 2 R is a natural variant of nisin. the partial sequencing of the reconstructed protein showed that the peptide has an amino acid change in the sequence of the leader peptide compared with nisin A, Z, Q U and F, but the structure of the mature is homologous to that of nisin F.
