40|$|Turkey {{is one of}} {{the most}} seismically active {{countries}} in the world and most of her damaging earthquakes are of inland-type. These earthquakes mostly result in permanent ground deformation as a consequence of faulting and liquefaction. Liquefaction is a process by which sediments below the water table temporarily lose strength and behave as a viscous liquid rather than a solid. The actions in the soil which produce liquefaction are as follows; seismic waves and especially primarily shear waves. Photogrammetry and remote sensing methods, in which aerial photographs, satellite images and SAR laser profiling data are used, provide wide opportunities for determination of ground displacement depending on resolution and measuring accuracy. This study was undertaken as the quantitative measurement of permanent ground deformation and associated strain fields induced by liquefaction and faulting resulted from the 1999 Kocaeli earthquake in Turkey. The permanent ground deformation was measured through aerial photogrammetry technique around the Sapanca Lake and the southern shore of İzmit Bay, in the center of Sakarya city and Avcılar. The measurement areas around the Sapanca Lake are Hotel region, Eşme and Left corner region. The measurement areas around the southern shore of İzmit Bay are Başiskele, Seymen, Gölcük, Değirmendere, Halıdere, Ulaşlı, Hersek and Yalova. For the purpose, 1 : 35 000 <b>scaled</b> <b>aerial</b> photographs taken before the earthquake in 1994 and 1 : 16 000 <b>scaled</b> <b>aerial</b> photographs taken after the earthquake in 1999 were compared.

40|$|High {{resolution}} {{satellite images}} have reached {{to a high}} quality and {{have proved to be}} a useful data source for the creation of orthophoto images and different mapping products. A study was carried out in Gölbaşı near Ankara for geometric accuracy and feature compilation assessment of high resolution satellite images. Twelve ground control points (GCP’s) were established and marked before recording of images. Stereo-pair Ikonos, mono Quickbird and 1 : 16. 000 <b>scaled</b> <b>aerial</b> images were provided free of charge by Inta Inc. (Turkey), Eurimage (Italy) and General Command of Mapping (Turkey). Using photogrammetric, cartographic or Ikonos DEM, various orthophotos have been produced with different combinations of ground control points. Well-recognized 27 checkpoints (CP’s) such as junction of roads and field corners have been defined and measured with GPS. Planimetric coordinates of the checkpoints were also measured on all orthophotos and compared with GPS coordinates. Three regions of different characteristics have been selected in the study area for feature compilation analyses. Three different experienced operators compiled features on these regions for 1 : 5. 000 scaled map productions. Map productions from different sources (Ikonos, Quickbird and aerial images) have been compared within each other. And finally the compiled features have been controlled in field. The geometric accuracy results show that the high resolution satellite images can be used in middle to large scale (1 : 6. 000 to 1 : 10. 000) mapping productions. Moreover feature compilation assessment results reveal that these images are still insufficient with respect to aerial images in terms of determining and identifying of small features...|$|E
40|$|This report {{responds}} to the 1986 Beaches Bill which, {{in recognition of the}} potential deleterious impact on Florida's beaches of inlets modified for navigation, mandated a study of those inlets with identification of recommended action to reduce the impacts. This report addresses west Coast inlets; East Coast inlets are the subject of a companion report. There are 37 inlets along that portion of Florida's West Coast commencing from Pensacola Bay Entrance to Caxambas Pass {{at the south end of}} Marco Island. Compared to those on the East Coast, most West Coast inlets have not had the deleterious effects on the adjacent beaches, yet all modified inlets without proper management have the potential of impacting unfavorably on the adjacent shorelines. Moreover, at present there is interest in opening three West Coast entrances which either have been open in the past (Midnight Pass) or which have opened occasionally (Navarre Pass and Entrance to Phillips Lake). A review of inlets in their natural condition demonstrates the presence of a shallow broad outer bar across which the longshore transport Occurs. These shallow and shifting bar features were unsuitable for navigation which in many cases has led to the deepening of the channels and fixing with one or two jetty structures. Inlets in this modified state along with inappropriate maintenance practices have the potential of placing great eroional stress along the adjacent beaches. Moreover. channel dredging can reduce wave sheltering of the shoreline by ebb tidal shoals and alter the equilibrium of the affected shoreline segments. The ultimate in poor sand management practice is the placement of good quality beach sand in water depths too great for the sand to reenter the longshore system under natural forces; depths of 12 ft. or less are considered appropriate for Florida in order to maintain the sand in the system. With the interference of the nearshore sediment transport processes by inlets modified for navigation, if the adjacent beaches are to be stabilized there must be an active monitoring program with commitment to placement of dredged material of beach quality on shoreline segments of documented need. Several East Coast inlets have such transfer facilities; however. the quantities of sand transferred should be increased. Although an evolution and improvement in the technical capability to manage sand resources in the vicinity of inlets is expected, an adequate capability exists today and a concerted program should be made to commence a scheduled implementation of this capability at those entrances causing greatest erosional stress on the adjacent shorelines. A brief summary review for each of the 37 West Coast inlets is presented including: a <b>scaled</b> <b>aerial</b> photograph, brief historical information, several items related to sediment losses at each inlet and special characteristics relevant to State responsibilities. For each inlet, where appropriate, the above infor tion is utilized to develop a recommenced action. (PDF has 101 pages. ...|$|E
