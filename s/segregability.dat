40|$|Segregation or de-blending of bulk {{particulates}} is {{a problem}} that is encountered in many industrial sectors. The magnitude of segregation can often determine whether a complete production batch can be transferred for onward processing within the plant or released to market. It is a phenomenon that impacts directly upon the profitability of a process. Segregation can occur through a coincidence of a range of variables that relate to the process and bulk particulate properties, common mechanisms for this include; percolation, surface effect (rolling) and elutriation. The importance to industry of predicting the sensitivity of bulk particulates to segregation cannot be under-estimated, and to this end various test procedures have been developed. Within many industries striving to improve product quality and reduce wastage, the determination of variability in blend consistency caused by segregation is an increasing priority. This paper considers recent work undertaken to evaluate the effects of multiple handling operations on the degree of segregation that results. The bulk properties of <b>segregability</b> (and resulting flowability) can not only influence the product consistency, but can have great influence over the process (production) control and performance...|$|E
