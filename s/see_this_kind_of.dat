500|$|Franks {{said that}} after her stint in 2008, many people {{recognised}} her {{in the street and}} asked if she would return. Scenes showing Phil and Rainie taking the drug crack cocaine in 2010 prompted over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying [...] "EastEnders in no way—and at no point—glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. [...] We took care to signal the nature of the episode's content to viewers in advance through programme publicity and billings, and the BBC Action Line was trailed following the episode for anyone affected by the issue. In addition to this, our website includes links to organisations who can offer help and advice on this issue. [...] We worked closely with drug and alcohol charities, including Addaction and DrugScope, throughout the editorial process to ensure that we handled the storyline accurately and sensitively." [...] The Daily Mail asked some viewers about the scenes, including one who said, [...] "I was shocked at the content of the episode. The graphic detail of the drug use with Phil and his friend was terrible and in view of the time that the episode was aired, entirely inappropriate. Viewers do not need to <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> storyline. Please, BBC, no more of these horrid storylines." [...] Other viewers said, [...] "They look like they're having a good time. They're in danger of making it look appealing." [...] Finally, [...] "It was a bit much. I've found EastEnders distressing over the last month." [...] The Daily Record described the scenes as 'disturbing'.|$|E
500|$|One dispute {{among the}} founders of Century 21 – Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, Reg Hill and John Read – emerged from the filming of other scenes, {{including}} {{one in which the}} character of Lise Hartman bathes in a shower. Read, the director of photography, had complied with Parrish's instructions to light the sequence in silhouette. Anderson, who had intended the scene to display full-frontal nudity from actress Loni von Friedl, demanded a re-shoot, insisting that Read honour his obligations not just to Parrish as director but also to his Century 21 partners. According to Sylvia Anderson, [...] "Gerry was very keen to show that {{he was part of the}} 'Swinging Sixties' and felt that seeing a detailed nude shot – as he visualised it – was more 'with it' than the more subdued version." [...] Anderson clashed with Read and Parrish for a second time when special effects shots of Phoenix were filmed with a hand-held camera: [...] "I knew enough about space travel to know that in a vacuum a spacecraft will travel as straight as a die... told me that people were not familiar with space travel and therefore they would expect to <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> movement." [...] Refusing to re-film the scenes on the basis that Parrish's instructions had precedence over Anderson's, Read resigned from both Century 21 and the production of Doppelgänger at the Andersons' and Hill's request. Anderson elaborated: [...] "Clearly John was in a difficult position. I do now understand how he must have felt, but in my heart I feel he couldn't play a double role." ...|$|E

In spare moments they pumped, for the packed fish dripped brine, which does not improve a cargo. But {{since there was no}} fishing, Harvey had time to look at the sea from another point of view. The low-sided schooner was naturally on most intimate terms with her surroundings. They saw little of the horizon save when she topped a swell; and usually she was elbowing, fidgeting, and coaxing her steadfast way through grey, grey-blue, or black hollows laced across and across with streaks of shivering foam; or rubbing herself caressingly along the flank of some bigger water-hill. It was as if she said: [...] "You wouldn't hurt me, surely? I'm only the little 'We're Here'." [...] Then she would slide away chuckling softly to herself till she was brought up by some fresh obstacle. The dullest of folk cannot <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing hour after hour through long days without noticing it; and Harvey, being anything but dull, began to comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus of wave-tops turning over with a sound of incessant tearing; the hurry of the winds working across open spaces and herding the purple-blue cloud-shadows; the splendid upheaval of the red sunrise; the folding and packing away of the morning mists, wall after wall withdrawn across the white floors; the salty glare and blaze of noon; the kiss of rain falling over thousands of dead, flat square miles; the chilly blackening of everything at the day's end; and the million wrinkles of the sea under the moonlight, when the jib-boom solemnly poked at the low stars, and Harvey went down to get a doughnut from the cook.|$|E

60|$|If this blue {{solution}} were combustible, {{and we were}} {{to place}} a wick {{at the top of}} the salt, it would burn as it entered into the wick. It is a most curious thing to <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> action taking place, and to observe how singular some of the circumstances are about it. When you wash your hands, you take a towel to wipe off the water; and it is by that kind of wetting, or that kind of attraction which makes the towel become wet with water, that the wick is made wet with the tallow. I have known some careless boys and girls (indeed, I have known it happen to careful people as well) who, having washed their hands and wiped them with a towel, have thrown the towel over the side of the basin, and before long it has drawn all the water out of the basin and conveyed it to the floor, because it happened to be thrown over the side in such a way as to serve the purpose of a syphon.[5] That you may the better see the way in which the substances act one upon another, I have here a vessel made of wire gauze filled with water, and you may compare it in its action to the cotton in one respect, or to a piece of calico in the other. In fact, wicks are sometimes made of a kind of wire gauze. You will observe that this vessel is a porous thing; for if I pour a little water on to the top, it will run out at the bottom. You would be puzzled for a good while if I asked you what the state of this vessel is, what is inside it, and why it is there? The vessel is full of water, and yet you see the water goes in and runs out as if it were empty. In order to prove this to you, I have only to empty it. The reason is this,--the wire, being once wetted, remains wet; the meshes are so small that the fluid is attracted so strongly from the one side to the other, as to remain in the vessel although it is porous. In like manner the particles of melted tallow ascend the cotton and get to the top; other particles then follow by their mutual attraction for each other, and as they reach the flame they are gradually burned.|$|E
