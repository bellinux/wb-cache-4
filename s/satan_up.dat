Making the bottom of the ravine after what seemed an interminable time, I found the tracks of Jones and Wallace. A long [...] "Waa-hoo!" [...] drew me on; then the mellow bay of a hound floated up the ravine. Satan made up time in the sandy stream bed, but kept me busily dodging overhanging branches. I became aware, after a succession of efforts to keep from being strung on pinyons, that the sand before me was clean and trackless. Hauling <b>Satan</b> <b>up</b> sharply, I waited irresolutely and listened. Then from high up the ravine side wafted down a medley of yelps and barks.|$|E

Michael then chains <b>Satan</b> <b>up</b> and binds him before throwing him into the Bottomless Pit, where he will remain until the end of Jesus' 1,000-year reign. Jesus then departs for the Temple's throne as Believers find one another and find temporary lodging in houses and residential areas in Jerusalem.|$|E

The letter contained a threat that Wouters's house would be burned down if Johan did not receive some money. Van Muyses claimed to be member of the buckriders and used the word <b>Satan</b> <b>up</b> to three times. In the trial of Wellen, the term buckriders is openly used against Philip Mertens, somebody who wrote a letter that resembled the letter of Johan.|$|E

The {{answer to the}} {{question}} of how <b>Satan</b> wound <b>up</b> in the bottom of the pit in Dante’s Inferno lies in Christian theological history. Some interpretations of the Book of Isaiah, combined with apocryphal texts, explain that Satan was cast from Heaven, and fell to earth. Satan, the angel, was enamored of his own beauty, power, and pride, and attempted to usurp God’s divine throne: ...|$|R
60|$|From {{time to time}} a {{rattling}} roll of pebbles, almost musical, {{caught my}} ear. It came {{from the base of}} the wall of yellow cliff that barred the summit of all those ridges. <b>Satan</b> threw <b>up</b> his head and nosed the breeze. The delicate, almost stealthy sounds, the action of my horse, the waiting drove my heart to extra work. The breeze quickened and fanned my cheek, and borne upon it came the faint and far-away bay of a hound. It came again and again, each time nearer. Then on a stronger puff of wind rang the clear, deep, mellow call that had given Sounder his beautiful name. Never it seemed had I heard music so blood-stirring. Sounder was on the trail of something, and he had it headed my way. <b>Satan</b> heard, shot <b>up</b> his long ears, and tried to go ahead; but I restrained and soothed him into quiet.|$|R

Milton portrays Hell as the abode of the demons, and the passive prison from which they plot their revenge upon Heaven through the corruption of the human race. 19th-century French poet Arthur Rimbaud alluded to the concept as well in the title and themes of one of his major works, A Season In Hell. Rimbaud's poetry portrays his own suffering in a poetic form as well as other themes.|$|R

60|$|Outside was one {{of those}} crowded streets of the east side, in which, as {{twilight}} falls, <b>Satan</b> sets <b>up</b> his recruiting office. A mighty host of children danced and ran and played in the street. Some in rags, some in clean white and beribboned, some wild and restless as young hawks, some gentle-faced and shrinking, some shrieking rude and sinful words, some listening, awed, but soon, grown familiar, to embrace--here were the children playing in the corridors of the House of Sin. Above the playground forever hovered a great bird. The bird was known to humorists as the stork. But the people of Chrystie street were better ornithologists. They called it a vulture.|$|R

As Satan prepared to take him to hell, Jack asked if he could have one apple to feed his starving belly. Foolishly Satan once again agreed to this request. As <b>Satan</b> climbed <b>up</b> the branches of a nearby apple tree, Jack surrounded its base with crucifixes. Satan, frustrated at the fact that he been entrapped again, demanded his release.

When Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, then Satan stood at his right hand to resist him; then the angel of the covenant, the Lord Jesus, pleaded for his help (Zech 3). By all which it appears, that this office comes behind, is provided as a reserve, that we may have help at a pinch, and then be lifted out, when we sink in mire, where there is no standing.|$|R

Single Puyo Puyo is a story mode. In an attempt not only to steal Arle's heart, but also to nab Kaa-Kun, <b>Satan</b> sets <b>up</b> a battle tower, in which Arle has to beat characters on each floor to climb up the tower. As Arle wins every match, she gains bonus points which add on to her total score, and this acts as Experience. As a result, the chains are weaker and do less damage, but it means the game is harder. There are five predefined rule sets available in the versus menu. The player can set custom rules. Multiplayer lets multiple players play together.|$|R
