25|$|The Sowden worsted coating loom: {{as in all}} {{mechanical}} devices, {{there is}} drive to improve efficiency, and this loom has several patent innovations. For example, the 28 shaft negative square dobby is similar in construction to Hattersley's Keighley dobby. However, to allow the shuttle more time {{to pass through the}} shed the dobby has special curved slots that allow the shafts to dwell or remain open for longer. In addition, the pattern chain or lags controlling the shafts can be set to control all 28 shafts, or set to operate the first sixteen shafts to weave the cloth and the remaining twelve shafts to produce a name list or <b>selvedge.</b> The word <b>selvedge</b> is derived from self-edge, the edge of the cloth where the weft is turned back as it returns through the shed. The <b>selvedge</b> would often have a brand name or the country of origin woven into it. On {{the left side of the}} loom is the patent four-shuttle drop box motion incorporating a foot pedal. This is part of an escape mechanism in case the shuttle becomes trapped.|$|E

25|$|To begin {{making a}} rug, one needs a {{foundation}} consisting of warps and wefts: Warps are strong, thick threads of cotton, wool or silk which {{run through the}} length of the rug. Similar threads which pass under and over the warps {{from one side to the}} other are called wefts. The warps on either side of the rug are normally plied into one or more strings of varying thickness that are overcast to form the <b>selvedge.</b>|$|E

Between the two wider bands, three narrow (3 or 4 picks each) yellow bands {{alternate}} with two dark brown bands (4 picks each). Two bands of dark brown and one of yellow are present along one edge, also. Yellow wool weft-wrapping {{was used in the}} wider bands to form patterns. The weft-wrapping is deteriorated but oval and other geometric forms can still be seen. There are some small yellow tapestry elements in the darker brown band. There are remnants of ribbed <b>selvedges</b> along both edges.; Somewhat dirty and worn. There are large edge tears. The weft-wrapping has deteriorated.

There are 14 brown patterned bands that measure from 1. 5 cm to 2 cm wide. In between, the yellow weft bands measure from 0. 5 cm to 0. 8 cm wide. The bottom yellow band {{is up to}} 1 cm wide and the top yellow band, including the border, is 1. 7 cm wide. There are remnants of <b>selvedges</b> along both sides and most of a border along one edge. The pattern motifs were created using tapestry and weft-wrapping.; Dirty and worn. Several interior holes, one fairly large. Small holes on the back may be insect damage. Some fraying along the top edge. One of the <b>selvedges</b> is missing large sections. The border is damaged in several places...|$|R
25|$|Village rugs {{are more}} apt to have warps of wool rather than of cotton. Their designs are not as {{elaborate}} and ornate than the curvilinear patterns of city rugs. They are more likely to display abrash and conspicuous mistakes in detail. On simple vertical looms, the correct tension of the warps is difficult to maintain during the entire weaving process. So, village rugs tend to vary in width from end to end, have irregular sides, and may not lay entirely flat. In contrast to manufactory rugs, there is considerable variety in treating the <b>selvedges</b> and fringes. Village rugs are less likely to present depressed warps, as compared to manufactory rugs. They tend to make less use of flat woven kilim ends to finish off the ends of the rug, as compared to tribal rugs. The variation in treatment of fringes and ends, and the way the <b>selvedges</b> are treated, provide clues as to place of origin.|$|R

60|$|His {{thoughts}} {{were of a}} sort not uncommon in those days. The world was strangely restless. Since the passing of Victoria the Great {{there had been an}} accumulating uneasiness in the national life. It was as if some compact and dignified paper-weight had been lifted from people's ideas, and as if at once they had begun to blow about anyhow. Not that Queen Victoria had really been a paper-weight or any weight at all, but it happened that she died as an epoch closed, an epoch of tremendous stabilities. Her son, already elderly, had followed as the <b>selvedge</b> follows the piece, he had passed and left the new age stripped bare. In nearly every department of economic and social life now there was upheaval, and it was an upheaval very different in character from the radicalism and liberalism of the Victorian days. There were not only doubt and denial, but now there were also impatience and unreason. People argued less and acted quicker. There was a pride in rebellion for its own sake, an indiscipline and disposition to sporadic violence that made it extremely hard to negotiate any reconciliations or compromises. Behind every extremist it seemed stood a further extremist prepared to go one better....|$|E
40|$|Pipe-shaped {{zones of}} altered rock {{containing}} disseminated and stockwork vein mineralization underlie {{each of the}} several Archcan volcanogenic Cu-Zn ore lenses at the Millenbach mine. The rocks and mineralization have been metamorphosed first to hornblende hornfels assemblages, then retrograded to greenschist facies assemblages, but the metamorphism has not significantly affected the bulk composition of the rocks. The alteration pipes show a distinct mineralogical zoning in xvhich a core zone con-taining either anthophyllite-bearing assemblages or massive chlorite grades outward into a biotite-rich zone characterized by a spotted texture. Normative calculations xvere used to show that alteration pipes initially had a chlorite core which graded laterally and vertically into a sericite-rich outer zone and finally into unaltered rocks. Similar zoning is present on the <b>selvedges</b> of individual sulfide veins within the altera-tion pipes. Volume was conserved, and a distinctive metasomatic trend developed across the alteration pipes and vein <b>selvedges</b> during the alteration process. The most characteristic features of the altered rocks are increased Fe and Mg, and decrease...|$|R

[...] She went {{to the corner of}} the room, removed her smart slippers, and {{put on a pair of}} walking-shoes, tying them, with her foot on a chair, in a quiet disregard of her visitor's presence; took a brown holland sunbonnet from the wall, clapped it over her browner hair and hanging braids, and tied it under her chin with apparently no sense of coquetry in the act--becoming though it was--and without glancing at him. Alas for Madison's ethics! The torment of her worldly speech and youthful contempt was nothing to this tacit ignoring of the manhood of her lover--this silent acceptance of him as something even lower than her husband. He followed her with a burning cheek and a curious revolting of his whole nature that it is to be feared were scarcely Christian. The willows opened to let them pass and closed behind them.|$|E

5000|$|Shirvan is {{the name}} of the town and province, located on the western coast of the Caspian Sea, east of the Kura river, between the {{southern}} part of the river and the city of Derbent in the north. Kerimov distinguished six districts, which weave different types of rugs. Some Shirvan rugs come with a high knot density and short pile. More coarsely woven carpets have a higher pile. Symmetrical knots are used, woven with alternate warps depressed. The weft is generally of wool, in dark ivory to brown. The ends are flat-woven, light cotton or wool sumakh. The fringes are sometimes artistically knotted. The <b>selvedges</b> are either round, or 0.5-1 cm wide, in white cotton, with 2-3 ribs in figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads. White cotton <b>selvedges</b> are the most common in Shirvan rugs. Shirvan rugs may have town, or village designs, but less densely ornamented as compared to Kuba rugs, and the drawing is more sparse. Compared to Kuba rugs, Shirvan rugs are lighter, and more colourful, with a dark blue background. The borders often have a light background which is more sparsely ornamented compared to the central field. Light ivory, red or yellow rarely occur. Ivory is mainly used for prayer rugs.|$|R

50|$|The {{edges of}} a rug need {{additional}} protection, {{as they are}} exposed to particular mechanical stress.

The edge may consist of only one warp, or of a bundle of warps, and is attached to the rugs by weft shoots looping over it, which is termed an “overcast”. The edges are often further reinforced by encircling it in wool, goat's hair, cotton, or silk in various colours and designs. Edges thus reinforced are called <b>selvedges,</b> or shirazeh from the Persian word.|$|R
