25|$|A variant on {{the fast}} bowler's action is the sling (sometimes {{referred}} to as the slingshot or javelin), where the bowler begins his delivery with his or her arm fully extended behind their back. The <b>slinging</b> action generates extra speed, but sacrifices control. The most famous exponent of the <b>slinging</b> action was Jeff Thomson, who bowled at extraordinary pace off a short run up. Other international examples include Fidel Edwards, Shaun Tait, Lasith Malinga and Mitchell Johnson.|$|E

Fifty-one consecutive women who had a VMRF (n = 27) or a pubovaginal <b>sling</b> (n = 24) procedure between March 1995 and December 1997 were evaluated. The patient-determined subjective success rate of the VMRF <b>sling</b> (85 %) was significantly higher than that of the pubovaginal <b>sling</b> (58 %) in women with low urethral pressure stress incontinence (P= 0. 03). The objective success rates following the VMRF and the pubovaginal <b>sling</b> were 52 % and 50 %, respectively. The prevalence of postoperative symptomatic voiding dysfunction and de novo detrusor instability was 7 % after the VMRF <b>sling</b> and 25 % following the pubovaginal <b>sling</b> (P= 0. 08). The VMRF <b>sling</b> had a higher patient-determined success rate and a lower complication rate than the pubovaginal <b>sling,</b> and should be considered in the surgical management of women with low urethral pressure stress incontinence...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of urodynamically proven {{stress urinary incontinence}} underwent a paradigm shift with the focus changing from bladder neck suspension to support of the mid-urethra {{in the last two}} decades. This has resulted in the replacement of Burch colposuspension and pubo-vaginal <b>slings</b> to synthetic mid-urethral <b>slings</b> as the primary surgical option in women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The introduction of synthetic mid-urethral <b>slings</b> has resulted in good objective and subjective cure rates but can be associated with complications that pose a challenge to the treating surgeon. Surgical treatment for SUI has rapidly evolved, and the initially introduced mid-urethral <b>sling,</b> retropubic tension-free vaginal tape (TVT), is accepted worldwide as a standard treatment for women suffering from SUI. However, <b>slings</b> have been associated with a few early and delayed complications which may result in varying degrees of morbidity. Serious complications such as bowel injury, major vascular injury, and even death have been reported with mid-urethral <b>sling</b> procedures. Sling complications are related to the <b>sling</b> type, surgical technique and time elapsed postsurgery. Though there are numerous devices available in the market, three different types of mid-urethral <b>slings</b> are commonly described in current practice, namely-retropubic <b>slings</b> (TVT, GYNECARE TM; AMS TM, RetroArc), transobturator <b>slings</b> (AMS TM, Monarc; TVT-O, GYNECARE TM) and single-incision mini-slings (AMS TM, MiniArc). The rationale for choice of <b>sling</b> has been discussed elsewhere in this book and the surgical technique varies with the type of <b>sling</b> chosen which in turn is intricately related to type of complications seen with <b>slings.</b> This chapter deals with the {{management of}} synthetic mid-urethral <b>sling</b> complications in the intra-operative and postoperative period...|$|R
25|$|The staff <b>sling,</b> {{also known}} as the stave <b>sling,</b> fustibalus (Latin), fustibale (French), {{consists}} of a staff (a length of wood) with a short <b>sling</b> at one end. One cord of the <b>sling</b> is firmly attached to the stave and the other end has a loop that can slide off and release the projectile. Staff <b>slings</b> are extremely powerful because the stave can be made as long as two meters, creating a powerful lever. Ancient art shows slingers holding staff <b>slings</b> by one end, with the pocket behind them, and using both hands to throw the staves forward over their heads.|$|R
25|$|The staff sling has {{a similar}} or {{superior}} range to the shepherd's sling, and can be as accurate in practiced hands. It is generally suited for heavier missiles and siege situations as staff slings can achieve very steep trajectories for <b>slinging</b> over obstacles such as castle walls. The staff itself can become a close combat weapon in a melee. The staff sling can throw heavy projectiles a much greater distance and at a higher arc than a hand sling. Staff slings were in use well into the age of gunpowder as grenade launchers, and were used in ship-to-ship combat to throw incendiaries.|$|E
25|$|Bill Edrich {{did some}} {{service as a}} fastish bowler with a <b>slinging</b> action while Norman Yardley's all-round skill won him a place in all the Tests. With his deceptively plain-looking medium-pace he {{actually}} took Bradman's wicket in three successive Test innings, and without any help from a fielder at that. But our out-cricket was simply not good enough.

25|$|After the Cincinnati and Mound City were rammed, it {{prompted}} Phelps {{to devise}} defensive structures {{for the various}} Union gunboats.

Reporting to Foote, he stated that Colonel Alfred Ellet had also arrived with some half dozen rams. While Phelps related that his report was made in the midst of much confusion, he also intimated that he was pleased with the performance of Davis, the new fleet commander. There was but little cooperation between Ellet and Davis – his rams viewed by the regular navy as inadequate for combat. Both Phelps and Davis expressed this view in their later writings.|$|E
50|$|A whoopie <b>sling</b> is {{an easily}} {{adjustable}} rope <b>sling</b> designed for tree pruning or tree removal. The whoopie <b>sling</b> works by wrapping the <b>sling</b> around {{the trunk of}} a tree or a heavy load bearing limb and pulling the end of the rope within the <b>sling</b> through a spliced choker. By adjusting the size of the eye in the rope through the choker the user is able to adjust the length of the <b>sling</b> constricting around the tree without needing knots. It is also becoming more common (usually in smaller diameter) for suspending hammocks during hiking or camping.|$|R

40|$|The {{information}} and evaluations provided {{in this report}} were compiled to address the recurring problem of synthetic <b>sling</b> failure. As safety {{is the number one}} priority in all work aspects, a solution must be devised to prevent accidents from occurring. A total of thirteen cases regarding synthetic <b>sling</b> failure were evaluated in order to determine their causes, effects, and preventative measures. From the collected data, it was found that all cases in which the synthetic <b>sling</b> contacted the edge of its load resulted in <b>sling</b> failure. It is required that adequate synthetic <b>sling</b> protection devices be used to protect <b>slings</b> in any lift where the <b>sling</b> comes in direct contact with the edge or corner of its load. However, there are no consensus codes or standards stating the type, material, or purpose of the type of protective device used to protect the <b>sling</b> from being cut. Numerous industry standards and codes provide vague descriptions on how to protect synthetic <b>slings.</b> Without a clear, concise statement of how to protect synthetic <b>slings,</b> it is common for inadequate materials and <b>sling</b> protection devices to be used in an attempt to meet the intent of these requirements. The use of an inadequate <b>sling</b> protection device is the main cause of synthetic <b>sling</b> failure in all researched cases. Commercial <b>sling</b> protection devices come in many shapes and sizes, and have a variety of names, as well as advertised uses. 'Abrasion pads' and 'wear protectors' are two different names for products with the same intended purpose. There is no distinguishable way {{to determine the extent of}} <b>sling</b> protection which these devices will provide, or what specific scenarios they are made for. This creates room for error in a field where error is unacceptable.

25|$|Australia {{had several}} series wins {{behind them and}} the {{selectors}} Sam Loxton, Neil Harvey and Phil Ridings picked the regulars; the batsmen Ian Chappell, Greg Chappell (despite recovering from influenza), Ian Redpath and Doug Walters, wicketkeeper Rod Marsh, fast bowler Max Walker and leg-spinner Kerry O'Keeffe. The fast bowler Dennis Lillee had demonstrated his fitness after his crippling back injury of 1973 and was brought back into the team along with the surprise choice of Jeff Thomson, an inaccurate fast bowler with a <b>slinging,</b> javelin throw action. His sheer pace would be the deciding factor in the series, though many pundits thought the left-arm Geoff Dymock {{would have been the}} better bet. The leg-spinner Terry Jenner was another surprise as Brisbane was not conductive to spin, but in the end the regular spinner Kerry O'Keeffe was made twelfth man and Jenner played in his stead. Wally Edwards and Ross Edwards were brought over from Western Australia. Wally was an angular opening batsman in the style of Bill Lawry and Ross had made his name by scoring 170 not out at Trent Bridge in the 1972 Ashes series.|$|E
500|$|From about 218 BC onwards, the Republican army's slingers were {{exclusively}} mercenaries {{from the}} Balearic Islands, which had nurtured a strong indigenous tradition of <b>slinging</b> from prehistoric times.

Professor Susan Stryker classifies the Compton's Cafeteria riot as an [...] "act of anti-transgender discrimination, rather than an act of discrimination against sexual orientation" [...] and connects the uprising to the issues of gender, race, and class that were being downplayed by homophile organizations. It marked the beginning of transgender activism in San Francisco.|$|E
