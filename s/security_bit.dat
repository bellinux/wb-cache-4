40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{encryption}} method based on Turbo code. In most communication systems, information encryption and error correction are always independent. While joint encryption and error correction codes combine these two processes into one. In {{order to provide}} information encryption and error correction simultaneously, we generate a normal random sequence that controls the puncturing mechanism by a secret key in the Turbo encoder. The puncturing mechanism is dynamic and controlled by the secret key. On the other hand, the keycontrolled puncturing mechanism deletes the parity bits randomly, which ensures a high error correction capability for the Turbo code. When decoding, only the legal receiver can generate the same normal random sequence using the secret key, then classify and decrypt the received sequence correctly. While for the illegal receivers, because a wrong secret key results in a wrong puncturing mechanism, and the Turbo decoder is sensitive to the puncturing mechanism, they will get a totally wrong decoding result. Meanwhile, this coding scheme also provides good error correction capability for the encrypted information while it is transmitted in a noisy channel. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method performs well in terms of both security and error-immunity.

30|$|In {{the art of}} work, the {{research}} provides different approaches to secure the communication in WSN. Cryptography {{is one of the}} common solutions for providing security. In this method, the key is distributed among the nodes either in symmetric or in asymmetric fashion. However, the asymmetric distribution of key requires more cost with less speed. In symmetric key distribution, key distribution is complicated as the key should be transmitted before the message. So, to reduce the complexity and eliminate the key distribution among the nodes, a simple and effective method is proposed which is called the Hamming residue method (HRM). The proposed technique enhances the security of the network against malicious attacks and improves the efficiency of the network. In this approach initially, a codeword is being generated by the use of defined initial <b>security</b> <b>bits</b> (user choice) and <b>security</b> check <b>bits</b> (Hamming bits). After which, quadratic residue technique is being employed to enhance the security at various hops. Using IPV 6, the information regarding the HRM is stored in the header and if the code matches with the code generated by the intermediate node, then it can access the data; if not, the node is considered to be an attacker node.|$|R

These cryptosystems show especially good performance properties. In particular, the MQQ-SIG signature scheme is the fastest scheme in the ECRYPT benchmarking of cryptographic systems (eBACS). We show that both the signature scheme MQQ-SIG and the encryption scheme MQQ-ENC, although using different types of MQQs, share a common algebraic structure that introduces a weakness in both schemes. We use this weakness to mount a successful polynomial time key-recovery attack. Our key-recovery attack finds an equivalent key using the idea of so-called good keys that reveals the structure gradually. In the process we need to solve a MinRank problem that, because of the structure, can be solved in polynomial-time assuming some mild algebraic assumptions. We highlight that our theoretical results work in characteristic 2 which is known to be the most difficult case to address in theory for MinRank attacks. Also, we emphasize that our attack works without any restriction on the number of polynomials removed from the public-key, that is, using the minus modifier. This was not the case for previous MinRank like-attacks against schemes. From a practical point of view, we are able to break an MQQ-SIG instance of 80 <b>bits</b> <b>security</b> in less than 2 days, and one of the more conservative MQQ-ENC instances of 128 <b>bits</b> <b>security</b> in little <b>bit</b> over 9 days.
