5|$|<b>Surface-to-surface</b> <b>missile</b> battalions {{were divided}} into three or four batteries, each {{equipped}} with one missile launcher. They operated thirty FROG-3 and eighteen SCUD missile launchers. The FROG-3, a tactical missile first introduced in 1960, was being replaced in other non-Soviet Warsaw Pact armies. Proven to be fairly inaccurate in combat, FROG and SCUD missiles would be ineffective weapons carrying conventional high-explosive warheads. Tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads, however, they could be devastating. According to one former Romanian official writing in 1988, Romania produced chemical agents that could be delivered by battlefield missiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanized}} divisions {{were organized}} along the Soviet model with three mechanized infantry regiments, one tank regiment, {{and a full}} complement of 12,000 infantry soldiers, while the armored divisions were composed of 3 tank and one mechanized infantry regiment plus support units. The artillery, antitank, and air defence regiments of divisions provided specialised fire support that enabled motorised rifle and tank regiments to maneuver. The air defense regiments consisted of two anti-aircraft artillery battalions and one surface-to-air missile (SAM) battalion, each composed of several batteries. In the late 1980s the artillery regiments of mechanized and tank divisions included two artillery battalions, one multiple rocket launcher battalion, and one <b>surface-to-surface</b> <b>missile</b> battalion.|$|E

Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating 388 crores for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical <b>surface-to-surface</b> <b>missile,</b> although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.|$|E

Specialised containers are particularly attractive to militaries already using containerisation to move much of their freight around. Shipment of specialized equipment in this way simplifies logistics and may prevent identification of high value equipment by enemies. Such systems may include command and control facilities, mobile operating theatres or even missile launchers (such as the Russian 3M-54 Klub <b>surface-to-surface</b> <b>missile).</b>|$|E

One of the first products of this was the development of rockets capable of holding nuclear warheads. The MGR-1 Honest John was the first such weapon, developed in 1953 as a <b>surface-to-surface</b> <b>missile</b> with a [...] maximum range. Because of their limited range, their potential use was heavily constrained (they could not, for example, threaten Moscow with an immediate strike).|$|E

The [...] and the replenishment ship [...] would be made part of the task force, however all the other Iroquois-class vessels were in refit. Maritime Command chose from among the remaining fleet the vessel with the best electronic countermeasures suite, Terra Nova, to deploy with the task force. Terra Nova was quickly altered to make her ready for an active war zone. The ship's ASROC system was landed and instead two quad Harpoon <b>surface-to-surface</b> <b>missile</b> system was installed. A Mk 15 Phalanx close-in weapon system was placed on the quarterdeck in place of the landed Limbo ASW mortar and two 40 mm/60 calibre Boffin guns were installed in single mounts where the ship's boats were. The ship was also fitted with new chaff, electronic and communications systems. Restigouche received a similar refit before deploying as Terra Novas intended replacement in the Persian Gulf in 1991.|$|E

[...] It was the second squadron intended for eventual tactical deployment, and trained at Patrick Air Force Base {{under the supervision of the}} 6555th Guided Missiles Squadron, which was assigned to the 6555th Guided Missile Wing of Air Research and Development Command. [...] Its TM-61 Matadors were designed to carry a nuclear warhead and after being rocket launched used a conventional jet engine to reach their targets. [...] Training under the 6555th included individual training, followed by team training, where the individuals were joined together and trained as crews. [...] The final phase of training was conducted by the unit itself. [...] Because of a shortage in training equipment and the earlier activation of the 1st Pilotless Bomber Squadron, the squadron's training was delayed until June. [...] By the end of the year, the squadron was considered [...] "basically trained." [...] However, lack of systems equipment and training launch delays caused by problems with the Matador's performance delayed the squadron's planned deployment.|$|E
