Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, <b>sure,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E

60|$|Burr. Now I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mind to me; {{when a woman}} once falls a preaching, {{the next}} thing is ever use and application.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would always}} hear you, Mr. Mackellar," [...] said he, [...] "and {{that at any}} hour, whether {{of the day or}} night, for I would be always <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> reason. <b>You</b> spoke once before to very proper purpose; I have not {{forgotten}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I am very <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mind {{capable of}} doing the most liberal justice to {{everything}} interesting and beautiful. You are extremely intelligent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, to be <b>sure.</b> <b>You</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot {{of these}} for nothing, and some tobacco too," [...] said the trader, handing the gifts to the Indian.|$|R
60|$|LADY CICELY. Oh no. After all, {{those men}} must really like you, Captain Brassbound. I feel <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> kind heart. You have such nice eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] {{answered}} the Sultan, [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{good reason for}} not doing so, and having heard your cry of distress, I am come to offer you my help. Whose is this palace, {{and why is it}} thus empty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, {{interrupt}} me not," [...] {{said the}} falconer--"Satan {{was a good}} nag-- But I say I think I shall call the two eyases after you, the one Roland, and the other Graeme; and while Adam Woodcock lives, be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> friend--Here is to thee, my dear son." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your news {{does not}} {{surprise}} me, Harry. I <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> feeling {{all along that}} you knew something, but were keeping it from me. You spoke so very seldom of them, and when you did {{it seemed to me}} that what you said was not spoken in your natural voice. I felt <b>sure</b> that <b>had</b> <b>you</b> known nothing <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> often talked to us of meeting them in London, and of the happiness it would be. I would not ask, because I was <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good reason for not telling us; but I was quite sure that there was something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much, I {{can help him}} more at home; but I'll come for the whole day, for I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great deal on your hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done <b>a</b> {{great deal}} for him," [...] said Miss Trevor rather patronizingly. [...] "But I think he should <b>have</b> more than <b>you</b> can give him now. He {{should be sent to}} school." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{was very}} wise," [...] Elizabeth declared, wiping {{the tears from}} her eyes. [...] "As an {{experience}} you are delightful. As a husband you would be terribly impossible. Are you going to stay and {{take me out to}} dinner this evening? I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dress suit now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For my part," [...] {{continued}} Mister Woodchuck, [...] "I'm very soft-hearted, and wouldn't even step on an ant if I {{could help}} it. Also I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> kind disposition. But {{you are a}} human, and I am a woodchuck; so I think I {{will take you to}} old Stoneyheart and let him decide your fate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} anyone so like a queen," [...] said Fred. [...] "No, nor anyone so {{beautiful}}, {{though she is}} so pale and thin. People say you are like her in her young days, Henrietta; and to be <b>sure,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> decent face of your own, but {{you will never be}} as beautiful as mamma, not if you live to be a hundred." ...|$|E
60|$|Dor. Ay, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> need make <b>a</b> holiday for me, for I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made me <b>a</b> martyr.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> cannot <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better; for if I do {{not know}} anybody, it is {{impossible}} for me to talk to them; and, besides, I do not want to talk to anybody." ...|$|R
5000|$|Words were {{spoken at}} {{the setting of}} time. Words which put {{together}} told a terrifying tale, a prophecy of doom.Man had crossed into the black land and returned diseased. Evil <b>had</b> found <b>a</b> door into another Kingdom. Somehow {{it had to be}} kept shut. Prehistoric man kept vigil until it was forgotten why. Of course they thought you were crazy, but you insisted on returning to that ancient place, just to make <b>sure.</b> <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> feeling about these relics, a feeling of death.Unwittingly <b>you</b> <b>had</b> sprung <b>an</b> invisible lock of an invisible door. A prophecy is about to be fulfilled. The Dead will rise again to eat the flesh of the living.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, little monkey, {{you must}} be in your best voice: you're the {{minstrel}} of the Manor, you know, and be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pretty gown and a new ribbon. You must not be dressed in russet, though you are a singing-bird.' Or perhaps, 'It is your turn to be courted next, Tina. But don't you learn any naughty proud airs. I must have Maynard let off easily.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't know,' {{said his}} brother, whose roused {{feelings}} had soon yielded to surprise, 'who may have abused your ear with such representations; or {{why you have}} chosen to try me, rather than another. But {{that you have been}} trying me, and tampering with me, I am now <b>sure.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> different manner and a different aspect from any that I ever saw m you. I will only say to you, once more, you are deceived.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wise man," [...] she pronounced, {{rising to}} her feet. [...] "Come, {{let us go}} and help Helen pick leaves. She is {{scratching}} her fingers terribly, and I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> knife. A dear, economical creature, Helen," [...] she added, as they strolled along. [...] "I am perfectly certain that those are destined to adorn my dining-table, and, with chrysanthemums at sixpence each, you can't imagine how welcome they are. Come, produce the knife, Mr. Lessingham." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must go," [...] said Mr. Grady, pouring it out, [...] "but {{that reminds}} me. It comes over me sudden-like, as I sit here, that you {{certainly}} {{ought to be}} in the new encyclopeedie of the prominent men of the State. But <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> received <b>an</b> application." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{we got a}} hackney-cab, and put a {{chair in}} it, and just round the corner they lifted {{me out of the}} cab and into the chair, and carried me here that I might see my dear friend in his own establishment! This," [...] says Grandfather Smallweed, {{alluding}} to the bearer, who has been in danger of strangulation and who withdraws adjusting his windpipe, [...] "is the driver of the cab. He has nothing extra. It is by agreement included in his fare. This person," [...] the other bearer, [...] "we engaged in the street outside for a pint of beer. Which is twopence. Judy, give the person twopence. I was not <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> workman of your own here, my dear friend, or we needn't have employed this person." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good day, sir,' said my aunt, 'and good-bye! Good day to you, too, ma'am,' said my aunt, turning {{suddenly}} {{upon his}} sister. 'Let me see you ride a donkey over my green again, and as <b>sure</b> as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> head upon your shoulders, I'll knock your bonnet off, and tread upon it!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear Fanny, believe me, {{you never}} have a shadow of either, but in using the words so improperly. There is no reason in the world why {{you should not be}} {{important}} where you are known. You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> grateful heart, that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it. I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will manage}} it, Conway. I can dictate it if I don't feel up to writing it. But {{you had better}} not come over to-day. There {{will be a good}} deal of {{excitement}} over this capture, and no doubt several of the killed and prisoners belong to Ballyporrit; so it wouldn't do for you to leave the detachment without an officer. Be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> strict guard put over the prisoners, and keep an eye upon them yourself. You can send over to inquire about us, but till you have got them off your hands you had better not leave the village. If a party are wanted for still-hunting send Sergeant Morris with them. I shall dispatch my report to-night, and no doubt the colonel will send an officer out to help you as soon as he gets it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Le Breton {{threw herself}} once more into a {{paroxysm}} of tears. 'Oh, Ernest,' she cried, 'do spare me! do spare me! This is too wicked, too unfeeling, too cruel of you altogether! I knew already {{you were very}} selfish and heartless and headstrong, but I didn't know you were quite so unmanageable and so unkind as this. I appeal to your better nature--for you HAVE a better nature--I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better nature: you're MY son, and you can't be utterly devoid of good impulses. I appeal confidently to your better nature to throw off this unhappy, designing, wicked girl {{before it is too}} late! She has made you forget your duty to your mother, but not, I hope, irrevocably. Oh, my poor, dear, wandering boy, won't you listen to the voice of reason? won't you return once more like the prodigal son, to your neglected mother and your forgotten duty?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, mother," [...] said Dwight, [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> told us <b>a</b> {{good many}} times that we must never say any thing unless we are sure it is true." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, anyway, it's a {{perfectly}} elegant story, Anne, {{and will make}} you famous, of that I'm <b>sure.</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> got <b>a</b> title for it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{delightful}} {{it must be}} to {{have friends}} like that to love you and plan for you," [...] said Grace wistfully. [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pleasant vacation, Bertie. As for me, I am going into Clarkman's bookstore until school reopens. I saw Mr. Clarkman today and he agreed to take me." ...|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the house}} visits, you make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{sufficient}} supply of pastry, cookies, fresh and dried fruits and mixed nuts on hand, as you typically serve your visitors with these items with tea and other beverages. Many Iranians will throw large Nowruz parties in a central location {{as a way of}} dealing with the long distances between groups of friends and family.|$|E
5000|$|... “Their {{relationship}} {{was more like}} father and son than anything,” said Fagan’s friend and frequent co-writer Kacey Jones. “Tom rescued Rich from a life situation that would have gone nowhere but bad. He dusted him off and said, ‘Your job is to write songs. I’ll make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> roof over your head and food {{and all the things}} you need to live, and you’ll write songs.’ ” ...|$|E
50|$|Rooms do {{not have}} televisions, {{although}} there are connection points {{if you wish to}} have one. There is a television in the shared living room however. If you do take one, and intend to watch TV programmes as they are broadcast, then you must make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> television licence. If you are only using the TV as a monitor then no licence is required. There is an in room phone which can be used to communicate with other members of Birkbeck Court or to security if you need. Each room has an internet connection point so that students are able to surf the internet at 24 hours. The price of the internet is included in the rent.|$|E
50|$|In {{inviting}} {{business to}} move to South Carolina she has said:What I'm saying is, {{if you come to}} South Carolina, {{the cost of doing business}} is going to be low here. We are going to make <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> loyal, willing workforce and we are going to be one of the lowest union-participation states in the country.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! to be shure, an' it's {{not such}} a purty young lady as {{yourself}} that need be taking the trouble,' did not fall pleasantly on her ears, and still less Ratia's laugh and exclamation, 'You make too <b>sure,</b> do <b>you?</b> <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> care. There were black looks at parting! But you need not be afraid, if handsome {{be a part of}} the spell.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is common}} sense {{in what you}} say, Mike, {{but there is nothing}} more {{unpleasant}} than, when you are with a number of Irish gentlemen or Spanish grandees, who are equally proud of their ancestors, to be unable to give any account of your family, or even to be <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to the name that you bear." ...|$|R
