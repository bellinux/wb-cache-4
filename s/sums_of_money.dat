5|$|The Abwehr {{was right}} {{to worry about the}} {{presence}} of British double agents within their secret service. They were at that time already running 'Garbo' (Juan Pujol), 'Zig-Zag' (Eddie Chapman) and 'Tricycle' (Dušan Popov), supposedly German agents to whom they were paying large <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> but who were in reality working for the British and were supplying the Germans with false information.|$|E

Income from a dowry could be significant. The larger a woman's dowry relative to her husband's wealth, the more influence she was likely {{to have in the}} household since she retained the dowry if the couple divorced. Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance if they were the closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property.|$|E
