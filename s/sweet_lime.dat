40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this grant was to characterize the vacuolar V-ATPase of lemon fruits. Lemon fruit vacuoles have an internal pH of about 2. 5. Since a typical plant vacuole has a luminal pH of around 5. 5, the lemon fruit V-APTase must have special properties which allow it to acidify the lumen to such a low pH: (1) it might have a different structure; (2) it might have a different H{sup +}/ATP stoichiometry; and (3) it might be regulated differently. During {{the course of the}} investigations (which began in 1996) they characterized these aspects of the V-ATPases of both lemon fruits and lime fruits. They examined lime fruits because of the availability of both acidic limes with a low vacuolar pH and <b>sweet</b> <b>limes,</b> which have a much higher vacuolar pH. The existence of two types of lime fruits allowed a comparison of the V-ATPases of the two varieties. In this report they are including two publications from 1996 and 1997 as background for the later publications. A review article with Heven Sze on V-ATPase nomenclature was also generated during the funding period. In addition to the studies on citrus fruit vacuoles, they also initiated studies in two new areas: polar auxin transport and the regulation of stomatal opening by UV-B irradiation. These studies were intended to serve as a basis of future separate grants, but the proposals they submitted on these topics were not funded...|$|R

Flavanones have been demonstrated to induce cytotoxic activity toward various human cancer cell lines with little effect on normal cells. Patil et al.

40|$|The {{chemical}} composition and sensory characteristics vary significantly within different honey types. In {{order to determine}} botanical origin of honey, {{it is necessary to}} conduct rather complicated and time consuming analytical methods. IR spectroscopy has not yet been experimentally explored for honey analysis in Croatia, so the aim {{of this study was to}} determine claimed botanical origin of honey using both, standard and alternative (IR spectroscopy) methods, for the purpose of their comparison, Altogether 144 samples of nine different unifloral honey types (black locust, <b>sweet</b> chestnut, <b>lime,</b> sage, heath, rosemary, lavender, mandarin and strawberry tree) were collected from different Croatian regions directly from the beekeepers. In order to confirm claimed botanical origin of collected honey samples, melissopalinological analysis, moisture and electrical conductivity measurements were conducted. Infrared spectra of honey samples were recorded using the ABB Bomem MB 102 Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR spectrometer). Selected IR spectral regions were analyzed by multivariate data analysis, principal components analysis (PCA). Preliminary PCA of IR spectra showed significant clustering of the analyzed samples by botanical origin. The results of this study showed that IR spectroscopy provides reliable results, but also represents rapid and cheap analytical tool in comparison to commonly used standard analytical methods.

The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate responses of some Citrus spp. seedlings to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and thus their potential as rootstocks. The experiment was done with four tangerine varieties, Cleopatra, Fremont, Ocean and Sainamphung; and four other citrus species, lime (C. aurantifolia), pomelo (C. maxima), sweet orange (C. sinensis) and Troyer citrange (Citrus sinensis????Poncirus trifoliata), in pots for five months. Roots of non-inoculated plants were not infected with AM fungi, while inoculated plants were heavily infected with AM fungi, and contained 14 - 28 AM spores per 10 ????g of rhizosphere soil. Most of the citrus responded positively to AM fungi, but with different magnitudes among the varieties and species. Lime and pomelo seedlings were fast growing compared to other citrus species. Total dry weight and N, P, K and Mg contents were increased most strongly by AM fungi in lime, pomelo and tangerine varieties Ocean, Fremont and Sainamphung, but little or none in Cleopatra, Troyer and <b>sweet</b> orange. <b>Lime</b> was the most outstanding in the response to AM fungi, followed by Ocean tangerine and pomelo.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} written {{reference to}} Beeley Wood is in a deed dated from 1161 {{in which the}} monks of Ecclesfield Priory were given permission to graze their flock every year from January to Easter in a large wood stretching from Birley Edge down to the River Don. Beeley Wood is a surviving part of this large wood {{and part of it}} is still called Priory Wood. In this 12th century document the wood was referred to as [...] "BYLLHAUWODE" [...] which is derived from the two Old English words Billa and haga and means Billa's enclosure and suggests that the woodland was originally attached to an Anglo-Saxon farm belonging to Billa. Further mention was made in a document released upon the death of Thomas de Furnival in 1332 when Beeley Wood was named as one of eleven locations under the heading of Woods, Moors and Commons. Under this agreement people were allowed to graze their animals in the wood. However, by the 16th century Beeley Wood had become a coppice wood in which the pasturing of animals was discouraged. At the end of the 16th century Beeley Wood was one of eleven coppice woods in Sheffield which were mentioned in a document drawn up for Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury. By the 1890s the coppicing of Beeley Wood along with the other coppice woods in Sheffield {{was coming to an end}} because of reduced profits and woodland management problems. The wood was allowed to become a [...] "high forest" [...] with the strongest growth of a coppiced tree allowed to grow into a fully grown standard tree. Many of the older and sickly trees were cleared away at this time and replaced by saplings of trees that were not native to the Sheffield area, such as beech, <b>sweet</b> chestnut, common <b>lime</b> and sycamore. In late 1898 the Duke of Norfolk's forester planted Beeley Wood with 60 acre of timber trees such as ash, elm, sycamore, birch, <b>lime,</b> <b>sweet</b> chestnut and beech. The young trees were ordered from a nursery in Cheshire and were delivered to Wadsley Bridge railway station. In 2011 the Forestry Commission approved funding for a five-year plan to improve the unmanaged habitat of the wood, under the scheme an area of 9.6 acre will be coppiced and a further 2.7 acre will be thinned to allow more light and warmth into the wood and therefore improve conditions for wild flowers, insects and birds. In February 2016 the Environment Agency removed the middle two-thirds of Beeley Wood Lower Weir on the River Don as part of a scheme to allow the free migration of fish and let the river return to a more natural form.|$|R
