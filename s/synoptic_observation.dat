50|$|Meteorology {{extensively}} uses both metric and customary units. The METAR {{reporting system}} {{in use in}} the United States differs from the one used by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in that wind speeds are delivered in knots (instead of meters per second), water-equivalent precipitation in hundredths of an inch, and altimeter setting in the customary inches of mercury (instead of hectopascals). Furthermore, temperatures are reported in whole degrees Fahrenheit but are converted to Celsius when encoded in METAR reports. Most <b>synoptic</b> <b>observation</b> charts are expressed in SI units, except for the aforementioned wind speeds, which must be converted {{for the purposes of}} calculation. Upper-air temperature charts typically use the Celsius scale (the freezing line is of great importance at lower levels of the atmosphere in determining precipitation type) while potential temperature charts use the kelvin; both of these are in line with international usage. Atmospheric vorticity is typically measured in full rotations per 100,000 seconds (a rough metrication of the day) but does not use the SI-recommended radian.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Obtaining <b>synoptic</b> <b>observations</b> {{of dynamic}} ocean {{phenomena}} such as fronts, eddies, oxygen minimum zones and blooms has been challenging {{primarily due to}} the large spatial scales involved. Traditional methods of ob-servation with manned ships are expensive and, unless the vessel can survey at high-speed, unrealistic. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are robotic platforms that have been making steady gains in sampling capabilities and impacting oceanographic observations especially in coastal areas. However, their reach is still limited by operating constraints related to their energy sources. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) recently introduced in coastal and polar oceanographic experiments have added to the mix in observation strategy and methods. They offer a tantalizing opportunity to bridge such scales in operational oceanog-raphy by coordinating with AUVs in the water-column to get in-situ measurements. In this paper, we articulate the principal challenges in operating UAVs with AUVs making <b>synoptic</b> <b>observations</b> for such targeted water-column sampling. We {{do so in the}} context of autonomous control and operation for networked robotics and describe novel experiments while articulating the key challenges and lessons learned. I...|$|R
