5|$|Rau {{resumed his}} {{employment}} at Bosch in Feuerbach. During another general strike in several Württemberg cities, from 28August to 4September 1920, {{he led the}} <b>strike</b> <b>committee</b> in his firm, which resulted in his dismissal.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) {{and union}} members (over wage rates) {{resulted}} in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central <b>Strike</b> <b>Committee</b> decided to end the movement.|$|E
5|$|The strikes {{reached the}} {{politically}} sensitive Baltic Sea coast, with a sit-down {{strike at the}} Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk beginning on 14 August. Among the leaders of this strike were Anna Walentynowicz and Lech Wałęsa, a long-fired shipyard electrician who headed the <b>strike</b> <b>committee.</b> A list of 21 demands was formulated by the Inter-Enterprise <b>Strike</b> <b>Committee</b> on 17 August. The strike wave spread along the coast, closing the ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With {{the assistance of the}} activists from the KOR, and the support of many intellectuals (an Expert Commission was established to aid with the negotiations), the workers occupying the various factories, mines and shipyards across Poland organized as a united front. They were not limiting their efforts to seeking economic improvements, but made and stuck to the crucial demand, an establishment of trade unions independent of government control. Among other issues raised were rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners and an improved health service.|$|E
50|$|The DSM {{helped to}} {{co-ordinate}} the linking up of independent <b>strike</b> <b>committees</b> throughout the Rustenburg {{region and the}} country as a whole, helping to establish the Rustenburg Joint <b>Strike</b> Coordinating <b>Committee</b> which held the first meeting of the National <b>Strike</b> Coordinating <b>Committee,</b> chaired by DSM member Mametlwe Sebei.|$|R
50|$|Critics {{from within}} the Trotskyist {{tradition}} have sometimes argued that the Socialist Party misunderstands Trotsky's Transitional Programme. Since 'transitional demands' are an attempt to link today's struggles with the struggle for socialism, critics argue that Trotsky's transitional demand regarding the need for <b>strike</b> <b>committees</b> should be raised, and that the Socialist Party should argue for these <b>strike</b> <b>committees</b> {{to take control of}} the workplaces. They argue that this is preferable to arguing for nationalisation since nationalisation does not show how workers would reach workers' control of the workplaces.|$|R
50|$|In the lead-up to the strike, {{various groups}} formed to {{propagate}} and co-ordinate the action, {{such as the}} Art <b>Strike</b> Action <b>Committee</b> in California and the Art <b>Strike</b> Action <b>Committee</b> in the United Kingdom.|$|R
5|$|On August 14, the {{shipyard}} workers began their strike, {{organized by the}} Free Trade Unions of the Coast (Wolne Związki Zawodowe Wybrzeża). The workers were led by electrician Lech Wałęsa, a former shipyard worker who had been dismissed in 1976, and who arrived at {{the shipyard}} late {{in the morning of}} August 14. The <b>strike</b> <b>committee</b> demanded the rehiring of Walentynowicz and Wałęsa, as well as the according of respect to workers' rights and other social concerns. In addition, they called for the raising of a monument to the shipyard workers who had been killed in 1970 and for the legalization of independent trade unions.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, {{delegations}} {{from other}} strike committees {{arrived at the}} shipyard. Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise <b>Strike</b> <b>Committee</b> (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on {{to call for a}} relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard {{joined the}} strike, under the {{leadership}} of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the <b>strike</b> <b>committee.</b> By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes). More and more new unions were formed, and joined the federation.|$|E
5|$|The Workers and Socialist Party (WASP) was {{launched}} on Human Rights Day 2013 by {{leaders of the}} independent mineworkers' <b>strike</b> <b>committees</b> that led the strikes in the mining industry in 2012, {{before and after the}} Marikana massacre, and the Democratic Socialist Movement (DSM).|$|R
25|$|Early on 17 June 40,000 protesters had {{gathered}} in East Berlin, with more arriving throughout the morning. Many protests were held throughout East Germany {{with at least}} some work stoppages and protests in virtually all industrial centers and large cities in the country. Joint <b>strike</b> <b>committees</b> were established in Hennigsdorf, Görlitz, Cottbus and Gera.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} 1918-1919 period, workers' councils in Poland {{had also been}} set up in Congress Poland during the Revolution of 1905, in 1944-1947 in the {{aftermath}} of World War II, and in the Polish People's Republic during the Polish October of 1956. <b>Strike</b> <b>committees</b> and councils appeared during the strikes of 1980-1981 as well.|$|R
5|$|On August 4 limited {{transportation}} service resumed but largely dwindled {{as the day}} progressed. Hayes and his staff warned the strikers about the severe penalties provided by the SmithConnally Act for disruption of the war production: the instigators could {{be subject to a}} fine of $5,000, one year in prison, or both. This prospect was made more real when the United States Attorney General Francis Biddle started an inquiry into possible violations of federal laws by the strike organizers. On August 4 the <b>strike</b> <b>committee</b> again voted to continue the strike, but, in view of the possible SmithConnally Act penalties, told the workers to make up their own minds and follow the committee if they chose. The maneuver worked and the strike continued.|$|E
5|$|From {{early in}} his career, Wałęsa was {{interested}} in workers' concerns; in 1968 he encouraged shipyard colleagues to boycott official rallies that condemned recent student strikes. He was a charismatic leader, who helped organize the illegal 1970 protests at the Gdańsk Shipyard when workers protested the government's decree raising food prices and he was considered for the position of chairman of the <b>strike</b> <b>committee.</b> The strikes' outcome, which involved the deaths of over 30 workers, galvanized Wałęsa's views {{on the need for}} change. In June 1976, Wałęsa lost his job at the Gdańsk Shipyard because of his continued involvement in illegal unions, strikes, and a campaign to commemorate the victims of the 1970 protests. Afterwards he worked as an electrician for several other companies but his activism led to him continually being laid off and he was jobless for long periods. Wałęsa and his family were under constant surveillance by the Polish secret police; his home and workplace were always bugged. Over the next few years, he was arrested several times for participating in dissident activities.|$|E
5|$|Wałęsa {{worked closely}} with the Workers' Defence Committee (KOR), a group that emerged to lend aid to people arrested after the 1976 labor strikes and to their families. In June 1978 he became an activist of the {{underground}} Free Trade Unions of the Coast (Wolne Związki Zawodowe Wybrzeża). On 14 August 1980, another rise in food prices led to a strike at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, of which Wałęsa was one of the instigators. Wałęsa scaled the shipyard fence and quickly became one of the strike leaders. The strike inspired other similar strikes in Gdańsk, which then spread across Poland. Wałęsa headed the Inter-Plant <b>Strike</b> <b>Committee,</b> coordinating the workers at Gdańsk and at 20 other plants in the region. On 31 August the government, represented by Mieczysław Jagielski, signed an accord (the Gdańsk Agreement) with the Strike Coordinating Committee. The agreement granted the Lenin Shipyard workers the right to strike and permitted them to form an independent trade union. The Strike Coordinating Committee legalized itself as the National Coordinating Committee of the Solidarność (Solidarity) Free Trade Union, and Wałęsa was chosen as chairman of the Committee. The Solidarity trade union quickly grew, ultimately claiming over 10 million members—more than a quarter of Poland's population. Wałęsa's role in the strike, in the negotiations, and in the newly formed independent trade union gained him fame on the international stage.|$|E
50|$|Brisben {{worked as}} a high school history and social studies teacher in Chicago’s inner city for 30 years until his {{retirement}} in 1990. He served several terms as a representative in the American Federation of Teachers, Local 1, and frequently served on <b>strike</b> <b>committees.</b> He received several teaching awards, including being named Teacher of the Year by Teachers for Integrated Schools in 1964.|$|R
50|$|The Publicity Committee {{decided to}} launch provincial editions {{to control the}} spread of strike news {{throughout}} the country. It was welcomed by <b>strike</b> <b>committees</b> in certain localities who urged the importance of improved publicity, strike information and a counter to virulent blackleg publications. The Publicity Committee discouraged local printed bulletins, persistently worried that provocative material would emerge in the local sheets.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of those}} on {{unofficial}} strike began to make demands for change in {{the leadership of the}} NUM, and they set up <b>strike</b> <b>committees</b> to bypass the official union bodies. The union had avoided making demands of Labour governments since the Second World War, and it had been largely inactive during a period of widespread pit closures under the first Wilson government.|$|R
25|$|In 1989 the Student <b>Strike</b> <b>Committee</b> was {{the only}} Velvet Revolution {{movement}} in Olomouc.|$|E
25|$|The calling of {{a general}} strike had an {{unexpected}} result: it gave the General <b>Strike</b> <b>Committee,</b> whose makeup was far less militant than the longshoremen's <b>strike</b> <b>committee,</b> effective control over the maritime strike itself. When the Labor Council voted to terminate the general strike it also recommended that the unions accept arbitration of all disputed issues. When the National Longshore Board put the employer's proposal to arbitrate to a vote of striking longshoremen, it passed in every port except Everett, Washington.|$|E
25|$|The Interfactory <b>Strike</b> <b>Committee</b> (MKS) {{based in}} the Gdańsk {{shipyard}} eventually transformed itself into Solidarity trade union, of which she became a prominent member.|$|E
50|$|The Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs (PROC) is a {{standing}} committee {{composed of the}} four political parties of the Government of Canada {{that is responsible for}} the procedural and administrative matters relating to the Canadian House of Commons. It has 10 members, including the three party Whips. This <b>committee</b> is the <b>striking</b> <b>committee,</b> which chooses the members of the other House committees.|$|R
50|$|The new {{building}} included a state-of-the-art suite of offices for the Taoiseach and his staff, {{a set of}} visually <b>striking</b> <b>committee</b> rooms, new offices, canteen facilities, a helicopter pad and a new press briefing room. Originally the Office of Public Works had planned a new cabinet suite of rooms also. However the Government opted to continue to use the Council Chamber which had been the cabinet room for all Irish governments since 1922.|$|R
50|$|Quelch {{became the}} {{full-time}} {{editor of the}} SDF's newspaper, Justice. He also represented the SDF on bodies including various <b>strike</b> <b>committees</b> and the Trades Union Congress, and at socialist conferences across Europe. He was elected several times as {{the chair of the}} London Trades Council, {{and was one of the}} founders of the Labour Representation Committee. From 1892 until the end of 1908, he was also the business manager for the 20th Century Press, a radical publisher.|$|R
25|$|As {{early as}} February 8 some unions began {{to return to}} work at the urging of their leaders. Some workers went back to work as individuals, perhaps fearful of losing their jobs if the Mayor acted on his threats or in {{reaction}} to the pressure of life under the general strike. The executive committee of the General <b>Strike</b> <b>Committee</b> first recommended ending the general strike on February 8 but lost that vote. Finally on February 10, the General <b>Strike</b> <b>Committee</b> voted to end the strike the next day. The original strike in the shipyards continued.|$|E

25|$|Durst {{responded that}} he would {{henceforth}} improve toilet facilities, provide water in the fields, and allow one worker to witness the cleaning process. A strike was threatened by Ford if the other demands were not met, to which Durst responded by immediately terminating Ford and the others on the <b>strike</b> <b>committee</b> who accompanied him. Ford and the <b>strike</b> <b>committee</b> refused to collect their pay and exit the ranch, prompting Durst to call Deputy Sheriff Henry Daken {{and ask him to}} arrest the strike leader. No arrests were made owing to the lack of an arrest warrant.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} days, the strike spread {{to a growing}} number of factories all over the country, with numerous Inter-Enterprise <b>Strike</b> <b>Committees</b> (MKS) created in Szczecin, Wrocław, Wałbrzych, and other cities. By the end of August 1980, the protests reached Upper Silesian coal mines. The center of the protests in Upper Silesia was the Manifest Lipcowy Coal Mine in Jastrzębie-Zdrój, where the strike broke out on August 28. In August 1980, this mine employed some 10,000 people.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to find all {{available}} media published by <b>strike</b> <b>committees</b> at the Charles University and at other universities, to describe them and to compare them with the official daily and each other. Moreover, the publishers of those media should have been contacted with the request for interview. However, after discussion with my supervisor, interviews with publishers and editors were not done, because of complexity {{and scope of the}} thesis. The thesis summarizes activities of students during the Velvet Revolution of 1989 and focuses on student newsletters and magazines that were published by student <b>strike</b> <b>committees</b> and other independent student associations {{during the time of the}} revolution. Eleven media published in Prague, Pilsen and Olomouc are described. The described magazines are the following ones: Čaje o páté, EM 89, Informační bulletin, Nezávislí, Plzeňský student, Proto, Přetlak, Reflex, Růžové právo, Situace 89 and Skoba. In addition, individual journals are compared with each other. Firstly the journals from the Charles University and secondly the other magazines. One subchapter deals with comparison of students' media with the official daily Rudé právo, which was the most read newspaper in Czechoslovakia by that time...|$|R
25|$|During this period, {{dissident}} {{newspapers were}} freely publishing, fighting-peacock banners were unfurled, synchronised marches were held and rally speakers were protected. In Rangoon, {{the first signs}} of the movement began around the Buddhist full moon of Waso at the Shwedagon Pagoda when student demonstrators emerged demanding support for the demonstrations. Neighbourhood and <b>strike</b> <b>committees</b> barricaded and defended neighbourhoods and mobilised further demonstrations. In some areas, committees built makeshift stages where speakers addressed the crowds and brought donations to support rallies.|$|R

50|$|In 1989, {{autonomous}} {{trade unions}} and <b>strike</b> <b>committees</b> surged in Czechoslovakia, {{which called for}} the dissolution of ROH. A parallel Trade Union Coordination Centre was formed. ROH tried to manage the situation by declaring its independence from the Communist Party. The Slovak branch of ROH decided to subordinate itself to the Coordination Centre. The Czech ROH organization hesistated somewhat, but at a trade union conference held March 2-March 3, 1990 ROH dissolved itself. In its place a new trade union federation, ČSKOS was founded.|$|R
