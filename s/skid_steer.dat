25|$|A {{skid loader}} or <b>skid</b> <b>steer</b> loader {{is a small}} rigid frame, {{engine-powered}} machine with lift arms used to attach {{a wide variety of}} labor-saving tools or attachments. Though sometimes they are equipped with tracks, skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheel drive vehicles that can push material from one location to another, carry material in its bucket, or load material into a truck or trailer. Brothers Louis and Cyrill Keller co-invented the first skid-steer loader, which was based around a three-wheeled loader they developed in 1957 for a turkey farmer near Rothsay, Minnesota. In September 1958, they were hired by the Melroe brothers at Melroe Manufacturing Company in Gwinner, North Dakota, which was later to become Bobcat Company. Using the brothers' design, Melroe introduced the M60 Self-Propelled Loader and, in 1960, Louis added a rear drive axle, resulting in the M400 model, the world's first true skid-steer loader.|$|E

40|$|Position {{estimation}} using wheel odometric systems {{tends to}} give rather poor performances for an outdoor fourwheel <b>skid</b> <b>steered</b> mobile robot. Therefore autonomous control of these vehicles is extremely challenging in outdoor environments. This paper describes an outdoor localization {{system based on}} visual odometry for <b>skid</b> <b>steered</b> vehicle using forward faced camera and a downward faced camera.

Two consumer grade cameras were used and algorithm was tested using open source image processing libraries. The proposed system yielded an acceptable positioning accuracy on short runs in typical outdoor terrains...|$|R

40|$|A {{new concept}} {{mobility}} chassis for a robotic rover is described which is inherently simple with few moving parts or complex linkages.

The theoretical mobility limitations are discussed and compared with the results of field trials of the prototype platform. The theoretical model contrasted with measured performance is then used to predict the expected mobility of the RATLER design on the Lunar surface...|$|R

50|$|Gama did {{not seem}} as regular or uniform in its offerings {{compared}} to other diecast companies {{who may have been}} better at marketing. Like Siku, Corgi or Dinky, Gama made a wide variety of cars, trucks, construction, and commercial vehicles in diecast.

Some of these were similar to Gescha, NZG or Conrad, but Gama always seemed more oriented to toys and didn't seem to penetrate the truck promotional market like these companies did. Gama usually produced German brands such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Volkswagen - Faun was a common truck brand.|$|R
40|$|Given {{the long}} {{traverse}} times and severe environmental constraints on planet Mars, {{the only option}} feasible now is to observe and explore the planet through more sophisticated planetary rovers. To achieve increasingly ambitious mission objectives under such extreme conditions, autonomy for planetary rovers must be continuously enhanced based on the cues and experiences obtained from the current missions. Increased autonomy, obviously, relies {{on the quality of}} estimates of roverâ€™s state i. e. its position and orientation relative to some starting frame of reference. This thesis encompasses the analysis of different approaches used in planetary rover states estimation. Based on the observations obtained a state estimation approach using Extended Kalman filter based fusion of distance from odometry and attitude from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) has been proposed. To simulate a Sun-sensor-based approach for absolute corrections, a magnetic compass was used to give absolute heading updates. The technique was implemented on MotherBot, a <b>skid</b> <b>steered</b> rover. It showed an error range within 3 % of the distance traveled as compared to about 8 % error obtained from direct fusion. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
5000|$|Skid-steer loaders are {{typically}} four-wheel vehicles with the wheels mechanically locked in synchronization on each side, {{and where the}} left-side drive wheels can be driven independently of the right-side drive wheels. The wheels typically have no separate steering mechanism and hold a fixed straight alignment {{on the body of}} the machine. By operating the left and right wheel pairs at different speeds, the machine turns by skidding, or dragging its fixed-orientation wheels across the ground. The extremely rigid frame and strong wheel bearings prevent the torsional forces caused by this dragging motion from damaging the machine. As with tracked vehicles, the high ground friction produced by <b>skid</b> <b>steers</b> can rip up soft or fragile road surfaces. They can be converted to low ground friction by using specially designed wheels such as the Mecanum wheel. Skid-steer loaders are capable of zero-radius, [...] "pirouette" [...] turning, which makes them extremely maneuverable and valuable for applications that require a compact, agile loader. Skid-steer loaders are sometimes equipped with tracks instead of the wheels, and such a vehicle is known as a multi-terrain loader.|$|R
