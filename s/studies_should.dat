5|$|Anura {{is divided}} into three suborders that are broadly {{accepted}} by the scientific community, but the relationships between some families remain unclear. Future molecular <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships. The suborder Archaeobatrachia contains four families of primitive frogs. These are Ascaphidae, Bombinatoridae, Discoglossidae and Leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages. The six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder Mesobatrachia are the fossorial Megophryidae, Pelobatidae, Pelodytidae, Scaphiopodidae and Rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic Pipidae. These have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders. Neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs, including most common species. Ninety-six percent of the over 5,000 extant species of frog are neobatrachians.|$|E

25|$|From the beginning, it was envisaged that Māori <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> be a {{key feature}} of the new University, and the Centre for Māori Studies and Research was finally {{set up in the}} School of Social Sciences in 1972, after many delays.

25|$|The {{evidence}} for cognitive behavioral therapy is mixed. A 2012 Cochrane Review of randomized trials found that CBT {{had no effect}} on risk of reoffending for contact sex offenders. Meta-analyses in 2002 and 2005, which included both randomized and non-randomized studies, concluded that CBT reduced recidivism.

Histopathology <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> show focal lymphocytic sialadenitis. Objective evidence of salivary gland involvement is tested through ultrasound examinations, the level of unstimulated whole salivary flow, a parotid sialography or salivary scintigraphy, and autoantibodies against Ro (SSA) and/or La (SSB) antigens.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it seems}} that a certain {{effectiveness}} exists (and many studies have confirmed the effect), more statistically powerful studies are necessary to provide better evidence {{of the effectiveness of}} fumaric acid esters in treatment of psoriasis (e.g. more accurate in terms of the dermatological nosology of this autoimmune disease). Such <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> in the future help specify which psoriasis variants (in terms of the course, the immunological profile of the patient etc.) are suited to be treated with fumaric acid esters.|$|E
25|$|Neither {{sentinel}} {{lymph node}} biopsy nor other diagnostic tests should be performed to evaluate early, thin melanoma, including melanoma in situ, T1a melanoma or T1b melanoma ≤ 0.5mm. People with these conditions are unlikely to have the cancer spread to their lymph nodes or anywhere else and already have a 97% 5-year survival rate. Because of these things, sentinel {{lymph node biopsy}} is unnecessary health care for them. Furthermore, baseline blood tests and radiographic <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> not be performed only based on identifying this kind of melanoma, as there are more accurate tests for detecting cancer and these tests have high false-positive rates. To potentially correct false positives, gene expression profiling {{may be used as}} auxiliary testing for ambiguous and small lesions.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{examined}} other roles of complex I activity in the brain. Andreazza et al. (2010) found {{that the level of}} complex I activity was significantly decreased in patients with bipolar disorder, but not in patients with depression or schizophrenia. They found that patients with bipolar disorder showed increased protein oxidation and nitration in their prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that future <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> target complex I for potential therapeutic studies for bipolar disorder. Similarly, Moran et al. (2010) found that patients with severe complex I deficiency showed decreased oxygen consumption rates and slower growth rates. However, they found that mutations in different genes in complex I lead to different phenotypes, thereby explaining the variations of pathophysiological manifestations of complex I deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Progestogens, in {{conjunction}} with the hormone prolactin, are involved in the maturation of the lobules, acini, and areola during pregnancy: mammary structures that estrogen has little to no direct effect on. However, there is no clinical evidence that progestogens enhance breast size, shape, or appearance in either transgender women or cisgender women, and one study found no benefit to breast hemicircumference over estrogen alone in a small sample of transgender women given both an estrogen and an oral progestogen (usually 10mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate). However, the authors of the paper stated that the sample size was too small to make any definitive conclusions, and that further <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> be carried out to confirm whether progestogens significantly affect breast size and/or shape in transgender women. As of 2014, no additional study had looked at the issue. Anecdotal evidence from transgender women suggests that those who take progesterone supplements may experience more full breast development, including stage IV on the Tanner scale (many transgender women do not develop Tanner stage V breasts). However, there have been no formal studies with sufficiently large sample sizes to confirm this.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{these results}} of increased proportions of people seropositive for the parasite {{in cases of}} these neurological disorders do not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between the infection and disorder. It {{is also important to}} mention that in 2016 a population-representative birth cohort study which was done, to test a hypothesis that toxoplasmosis is related to impairment in brain and behaviour measured by a range of phenotypes including neuropsychiatric disorders, poor impulse control, personality and neurocognitive deficits. The results of this study did not support the results in the previously mentioned studies, more than marginally. None of the P-values showed significance for any outcome measure. Thus, according to this study, the presence of T. gondii antibodies is not correlated to increase susceptibility to any of the behaviour phenotypes (except possibly to a higher rate of unsuccessful attempted suicide). This team did not observe any significant association between T. gondii serpositivity and schizophrenia. The team notes that the null findings might be a false negative due to low statistical power because of small sample sizes, but against this weights that their set-up should avoid some possibilities for errors in the about 40 studies that did show a positive correlation. They conclude that further <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> be performed.|$|E

25|$|Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is an {{antioxidant}} {{that is made}} naturally {{by human}} cells. It can also be administered in capsules or {{can be found in}} foods such as red meat, organ meats, and yeast. Like other antioxidants, it functions by ridding the body of harmful free radicals that can cause damage to tissues and organs. It has {{an important role in the}} Krebs cycle as a coenzyme leading to the production of antioxidants, intracellular glutathione, and nerve-growth factors. Animal research has also uncovered the ability of ALA to improve nerve conduction velocity. Because flavors are perceived by differences in electric potential through specific nerves innervating the tongue, idiopathic dysgeusia may be a form of a neuropathy. ALA has proven to be an effective treatment for burning mouth syndrome spurring studies in its potential to treat dysgeusia. In a study of forty-four patients diagnosed with the disorder, one half was treated with the drug for two months while the other half, the control group, was given a placebo for two months followed by a two-month treatment of ALA. The results reported show that 91% of the group initially treated with ALA reported an improvement in their condition compared to only 36% of the control group. After the control group was treated with ALA, 72% reported an improvement. This study suggests that ALA may be a potential treatment for patients and supports that full double blind randomized <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> be performed.|$|E

500|$|The philosopher Timothy F. Murphy {{considered}} Sexual Preference {{an important}} study of homosexuality, which like other <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> {{be regarded as}} part of a scientific process of [...] "measuring the adequacy of hypotheses and evidence" [...] rather than as a [...] "window opening on veridical truth". John Heidenry suggested that it was the most important book on sexuality published in the early 1980s, writing that Bell et al. [...] "analyzed every known hypothesis, idea, or suggestion about the origins of homosexuality and found most of them were wrong." [...] Heidenry credited Bell et al. with avoiding the biases of many previous studies, which had drawn their samples from unrepresentative sources such as psychotherapy patients or prison populations. He observed that their conclusion that homosexuality may have a biological basis placed them in opposition to Kinsey's views, and that they ignored research that correlated the origins of same-sex preference with factors such as time of puberty, the amount of early sex, and masturbatory patterns. The anthropologist Gilbert Herdt wrote that Sexual Preference, like the Kinsey scale, places [...] "too much emphasis upon discreet acts of sex and not enough stress upon the cultural context and total developmental outcomes to which those acts are related." [...] Herdt called the study a [...] "quantitative sociological" [...] survey of homosexuality that decontextualizes [...] "the culture and lives at issue". Herdt argued, following the anthropologist Ruth Benedict, that all developmental changes need to be viewed in the context of social structure.|$|E
