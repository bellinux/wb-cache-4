25|$|This is the {{standard}} process used by National Mapping Agencies. It uses a plastic film, which is coated on one side with a photo-opaque film. The layer is removed with a <b>scribing</b> <b>tool</b> or scalpel to produce a negative image. One sheet of film is needed for each solid colour, and one for each screen, usually requiring about ten sheets of film altogether. The map is drawn at final map scale, and the negatives are printed with high quality dot screens to produce the five film positives for printing. The process {{makes it easy to}} produce high quality maps, but it does require a number of specialist tools.|$|E

50|$|An {{impression}} of the corrected compilation sheet is photographed onto scribe sheet material or drawn using pencil. While working over a light table, lines on the scribe sheet are traced with a metal or sapphire-tipped <b>scribe</b> <b>tool</b> to remove thin lines of translucent coating to produce a handmade negative image. This compares with drafting where an ink image is made on tracing paper by depositing ink using a pen to produce a positive image. Scribing produces a result superior to drafting, but is more time consuming.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{requested}} by Manufacturing Engineering {{to determine what}} effects marking with nylon (6 / 6) and Teflon scribes may have on subsequent bonding. Witness panel bond specimens were fabricated by the development lab to test both acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) to Chemlok and NBR to NBR after controlled exposure. The nylon rod used as a <b>scribe</b> <b>tool</b> demonstrates virtually no bond deterioration when used to scribe lines on either the Chemlok to NBR surfaces or the NBR to NBR interface. Lab test {{results indicate that the}} nylon rod-exposed samples produce tensile and peel values very similar to the control samples and the Teflon exposed samples produce tensile and peel values much lower than the control samples. Visual observation of the failure surfaces of the tested samples shows that Teflon scribing produces an obvious contamination to the surface and the nylon produces no effect. Photographs of test samples are provided. It is concluded that Teflon stock used as a <b>scribe</b> <b>tool</b> on a Chemlok 233 to NBR surface or an NBR to NBR surface has a detrimental effect on the bond integrity on either of these bond interfaces. Therefore, it is recommended that the nylon rod continue to be used where a scribe line is required in the redesigned solid rocket motor segment insulation layup operations. The use of Teflon scribes should not be considered...|$|R
40|$|The Automatic Gore Mapping System {{is being}} {{developed}} to reduce the time and labor costs associated with manufacturing the External Tank. The present chem-milling processes and procedures are discussed. The down loading of the simulation of the system has to be performed to verify that the simulation package will translate the simulation code into robot code. Also a simulation of this system has to be programmed for a gantry robot instead of the articulating robot that is presently in the system. It was discovered using the simulation package that the articulation robot cannot reach all the point {{on some of the}} panels, therefore when the system is ready for production, a gantry robot will be used. Also a hydrosensor system {{is being developed}} to replace the point-to-point contact probe. The hydrosensor will allow the robot to perform a non-contact continuous scan of the panel. It will also provide a faster scan of the panel because it will eliminate the in-and-out movement required for the present end effector. The system software is currently being modified so that the hydrosensor will work with the system. The hydrosensor consists of a Krautkramer-Branson transducer encased in a plexiglass nozzle. The water stream pumped through the nozzle is the couplant for the probe. Also, software is being written so that the robot will have the ability to draw the contour lines on the panel displaying the out-of-tolerance regions. Presently the contour lines can only be displayed on the computer screens. Research is also being performed on improving and automating the method of scribing the panels. Presently the panels are manually scribed with a sharp knife. The use of a low power laser or water jet is being studied as a method of scribing the panels. The contour drawing pen will be replaced with <b>scribing</b> <b>tool</b> and the robot will then move along the contour lines. With these developments the Automatic Gore Mapping Systems will provide a reduction in time and labor costs associated with manufacturing the External Task. The system also has the potential of inspecting other manufactured parts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. People who are deaf or hard-of-hearing {{may have}} {{challenges}} communicating with others via spoken words {{and may have}} challenges being aware of audio events in their environments. This {{is especially true in}} public places, which may not have accessible ways of communicating announcements and other audio events. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a mobile sound transcription tool for the deaf and hard-of-hearing. Our <b>tool,</b> <b>Scribe</b> 4 Me, is designed to improve awareness of sound-based information in any location. When a button is pushed on the tool, a transcription of the last 30 seconds of sound is given to the user in a text message. Transcriptions include dialog and descriptions of environmental sounds. We describe a 2 -week field study of an exploratory prototype, which shows that our approach is feasible, highlights particular contexts in which it is useful, and provides information about what should be contained in transcriptions. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper aims {{to explore}} the visual and epigraphic {{properties}} of medieval writing as well as considering writing medium, technique, and com-municative status. The boundaries between different auxiliary disciplines in Medieval Studies (paleography, epigraphy, numismatics, sigillography) have created separate categories of writings and scripts within the writing culture of the Middle Ages, even if the letterforms, functions, and types of writing actually do not differ from one medium to another. A strong case for removing the disciplinary boundaries rests on the facts that writing was executed by <b>scribes</b> sharing training, <b>tools</b> and know-how, and that the iconic value of script and its visual aspects were activated primarily in the display of letters regardless of the variations {{in the content of}} the text, in its location, or its lin-guistic form. “Epigraphic” forms are used in manuscript tituli; “manuscript” abbreviations are found in stone inscriptions; seals show “epigraphic” mise en page; calamus-like features are inscribed on coins… Beyond the obvious inaccuracy of terminology, what do those commonalities between written objects show? How could we address the porosity of medieval literacy...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} {{production}} induced defects in CIGS thin film modules which can deteriorate the electrical {{performance of the}} module. The motivation of this work is to both find ways how these defects can be diagnosed, e. g. in a quality control in the production site, and {{to gain a better}} understanding of the actual defect influence on the voltage and current in the surrounding of the defect. Thus, I investigate the use of electroluminescence and thermography as diagnostic tools to detect and identify common defects occurring in CIGS production. I begin this work with a study of the CIGS production process and list potential defect origins for relevant production steps. In order to allow an experimental investigation of defects, I intentionally implement them into CIGS photovoltaic modules in a real CIGS production site environment. The defect implementation includes e. g. interrupted P 1, P 2, and P 3 scribing lines for the monolithic series connection, as they can be caused by faulty <b>scribing</b> <b>tools,</b> and changes in the normal CIGS layer structure, as they can be caused by local contamination. Furthermore, I vary the geometry of the implemented defects. I characterise the implemented defects with microscope, electroluminescence (EL), and dark lock-in thermography (DLIT) measurements. EL and DLIT are chosen as they are spatially resolved measurements and therefore allow a comparatively fast investigation of a complete module. In addition to the defect measurements, I implement a software that is based on the principle of network simulation model and allows to model and simulate the implemented defect types in a CIGS module. The software models the CIGS module with a network, that consists of equivalent circuits of a solar cell and resistances, and translates the network into a non-linear system of equations that are solved. Finally, I investigate methods to repair an incomplete insulation of the Mo back contacts of two neighbouring cells. The measurements on defects yield that P 1, P 2, and P 3 scribing defects have characteristic EL and DLIT patterns. I show that the scribing defects can be reliably identified by these patterns if the length of the scribing line interruptions is sufficiently resolved in the EL and DLIT images. The explanation of the characteristic El and DLIT patterns of scribing defects is facilitated by the simulation software that yields the voltage distribution, which can explain the El images, and the current flow, which can explain the DLIT images. With regard to the simulation software itself, I present an alternative solving approach for the non-linear system of equations, that differs from the standard Newton-Raphson procedure and allows a scaling behaviour of the simulation duration with the number of equations close to the linear optimum. Moreover, EL measurements of point defects with implemented abnormal layer sequences show that the i-ZnO/CdS buffer layer combination has a shunt mitigating effect. From comparison of various point defect types I conclude that the CdS has during chemical bath deposition a surface smoothing effect and fills up cavities and holes in the CIGS absorber. I suggest that this surface smoothing allows the sputtered i-ZnO to form a uniform and unbroken layer, and thus prevent shunting contact between the front and back electrode. In contrast, when I remove the CdS layer locally, the point defects show strong shunting in EL and DLIT measurements if the defect implementation has caused sharp edges or flakes at the Mo or CIGS layer. Furthermore, Cu-rich debris is a potential contamination during CIGS co-evaporation, where it can fall down from the Cu evaporation source onto the module. For Cu-rich debris I find that its position within the cell determines whether it can be reliably identified by EL and DLIT measurements. Cu-rich debris on the P 1 line evokes among all defects a unique EL brightness pattern, which I explain by the simulation software as an overlay of a P 1 defect with two shunting defects, one located in each of the neighbouring cells. Eventually, I develop two repair processes for defective Mo back contact insulation (P 1 line). The first process is a thermal repair which uses thermally induced mechanical stress to create insulating fractures at the defect position. The second process is an electrical repair, where an applied current melts and evaporates remaining conductive Mo at the defect position, which finally results in an insulation, too. To draw a conclusion, the present work contributes to the understanding and diagnostics of production induced defects in Cu(In,Ga) Se$_ 2 $ photovoltaic thin film modules, and in case of the P 1 scribing defects even shows ways how they can be repaired...|$|R
