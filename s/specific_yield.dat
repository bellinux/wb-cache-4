Confined aquifers have very low storativity values (much less than 0.01, and as little as 10−5), which means that the aquifer is storing water using the mechanisms of aquifer matrix expansion and the compressibility of water, which typically are both quite small quantities. Unconfined aquifers have storativities (typically then called <b>specific</b> <b>yield)</b> greater than 0.01 (1% of bulk volume); they release water from storage by the mechanism of actually draining the pores of the aquifer, releasing relatively large amounts of water (up to the drainable porosity of the aquifer material, or the minimum volumetric water content).|$|E

For different regions, scale relationship in log-log ordinate can be fitted by two types of lines: straight and parabola, and for each line, a function was fitted using regression analysis. The different scale relationships have been explained in terms of the difference in surface material distribution and landforms. To offset the scale-induced influence, calculation has been done based on the fitted functions, in order to adjust the data of <b>specific</b> sediment <b>yield</b> to a common standard area. Based on the scaled data, a map of <b>specific</b> sediment <b>yield</b> was constructed using Kriging interpolation. For comparison, a map based on the un-scaled data of <b>specific</b> sediment <b>yield</b> was also constructed using the same method. The two maps show that the basic pattern of <b>specific</b> sediment <b>yield</b> was basically the same. The severely eroded areas (Y s > 10000 t km - 2 a - 1) were at the same locations from Hekouzhen to Longmen in the middle Yellow River Basin.

50|$|Porosity gives {{a measure}} of the water storage {{capability}} of soil but not all the water present in the soil pores is available for extraction by pumping for the use of humans or draining by gravity. The pores in the soil hold back sufficient quantity of water on account of forces like surface tension and molecular attraction. Hence the actual amount of water that can be extracted from the unit volume of aquifer by pumping or under the action of gravity is called as <b>specific</b> <b>yield.</b> The fraction of water held back in the aquifer is known as specific retention. Thus {{it can be said that}} porosity is the sum of <b>specific</b> <b>yield</b> and specific retention. <b>Specific</b> <b>yield</b> of soils differ from each other in the sense that some soil types have strong molecular attraction with the water held in their pores while others have less. It is found experimentally that cohessionless soils have high <b>specific</b> <b>yield</b> than cohesive soils because the former has significantly less molecular attraction then the latter. Coarse-grained soils or rocks such as coarse sandstone can have specific yields that are closer to their actual porosity in the range 20 to 35%. The case of fine grained materials is quite opposite to that range.|$|E

50|$|Energetic {{material}} pyrotechnic compositions, especially {{solid rocket}} propellants and smokeless powders for guns, often employ plasticizers to improve physical {{properties of the}} propellant binder or of the overall propellant, to provide a secondary fuel, and ideally, to improve <b>specific</b> energy <b>yield</b> (e.g. <b>specific</b> impulse, energy <b>yield</b> per gram of propellant, or similar indices) of the propellant.

Energetic plasticizers reduce the required mass of propellant, enabling a rocket vehicle to carry more payload or reach higher velocities than would otherwise be the case. However, safety or cost considerations may demand that non-energetic plasticizers be used, even in rocket propellants.

The increasing demand of pDNA has created the need to revolutionalize current production levels under optimum economy. In this work, different standard media (LB, TB and SOC) for culturing recombinant Escherichia coli DH 5 α harbouring pUC 19 were compared to a medium optimised for pDNA production. Lab scale fermentations using the standard media showed that the highest pDNA volumetric and <b>specific</b> <b>yields</b> were for TB (11. 4 μg/ml and 6. 3 μg/mg dry cell mass respectively) and the lowest was for LB (2. 8 μg/ml and 3. 3 μg/mg dry cell mass respectively).

However, it is the economic advantages of the optimised medium that makes it so attractive. Keeping all variables constant except medium and using LB as a base scenario (100 medium cost [MC] units/mg pDNA), the optimised PDMR medium yielded pDNA at a cost of only 27 MC units/mg pDNA.
