40|$|It can be {{observed}} an increased concern about the school classrooms, in particular about the study and design of school furniture fitting the students ’ needs and anthropometrics characteristics. The main {{aim of this study}} was to perform an anthropometric survey, considering the main anthropometric dimensions and, in accordance, to define the dimensions and characteristics of school furniture for Portuguese students of the 1 st education cycle using valuable and validated ergonomic criteria. The analyzed sample includes, so far, 432 students. Obtained results seem to reinforce the need to consider the specificity of the anthropometric characteristics of the Portuguese students by adding an extra <b>size</b> <b>mark</b> for school furniture in a future revision of the corresponding standard...|$|E

This paper presents {{the results from the}} application of an inverse transient modelling technique to a field water distribution system. Artificial bursts, developed over various durations, were induced at two different locations in the field network on two separate test dates. The artificial bursts were successfully located and sized using the inverse transient method. Information from two measurement stations, and then a single pressure measurement station, was used to detect the burst location and <b>size.</b> <b>Mark</b> Stephens, Dalius Misiunas, Martin Lambert, Angus Simpson, John Vítkovský & John Nixon[URL]...|$|E

It is shown that both types of particles demonstrate common EMR behavior, including special features such as the temperature-dependent narrow spectral component and multiple-quantum transitions. These features are common for small quantum systems and not expected in classical case.

40|$|A {{method of}} heat-assisted {{magnetic}} recording potentially suitable for probe-based storage systems is characterized. In this work, field-emission current from a {{scanning tunneling microscope}} tip isused as the heating source. Pulse voltages of 2 - 7 V were applied to a CoNi/Pt multilayered film. During heating, various external magnetic fields were applied. Experimental results show that apositive magnetic field increases <b>mark</b> <b>size</b> while a negative field decreases <b>mark</b> <b>size,</b> compared {{to the case of}} writing without an external field in which an average <b>mark</b> <b>size</b> of 170 nm was achieved. In addition, a positive field reduces the threshold voltage of writing as well. A synthesized model is built to quantitatively simulate the experimental results. It includes the model of emission current,heat transfer, and dynamics of magnetic domains in the film. Simulation results show that the calculated <b>mark</b> <b>size</b> in various cases is consistent with experimental results.

40|$|Abstract. Background: A new cytokeratin tumor marker, MonoTotal was {{studied in}} lung cancer, {{the most common}} cause of cancer {{mortality}} worldwide. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients MonoTotal serum levels and their relationship to the tumor stage, histological subtype, early relapse and cancer-related death were evaluated. Patients and Methods: MonoTotal serum levels were studied, using immunoradiometric assay in a group of 93 patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC undergoing radical surgery, and were compared to those with benign lung diseases. Results: A diagnostic power of MonoTotal in distinguishing patients with NSCLC from benign lung diseases was demonstrated. Higher levels of MonoTotal were associated with advanced stages of squamous cell carcinoma and there was a positive correlation of marker with tumor <b>size.</b> <b>Marker</b> levels showed significan...|$|R

30|$|Studies {{examining}} {{the ability of}} ultrasound to predict difficult airways have been performed in adult patients in the pre-operative surgical setting using variable patient positioning and scanning protocols. Ultrasound measurements {{at the level of}} tongue, pharynx, larynx, and trachea have been compared to Cormack–Lehane Grades (CLG) determined during direct laryngoscopy [11]. Difficult laryngoscopy was found to correlate with ultrasound measurements taken at the hyoid bone, thyrohyoid membranes, and hyomental distance with patients in the sniffing position [12 – 14]. A South Korean study used ultrasound to examine the epiglottis in normal patients and those diagnosed with acute epiglottis and found {{a significant difference in the}} anteroposterior diameter, promoting ultrasound as a possible tool for diagnosing acute epiglottis [15]. Despite these results, several studies have had contradictory findings, and all were limited by small sample <b>size,</b> <b>marked</b> differences in population characteristics, and an absence of a specified ultrasound scanning protocol [16].|$|R
40|$|Actinic keratosis (AK) is a common, sun-induced, pre-malignant lesion with {{a strong}} {{likelihood}} of progressing to a malignancy. The reported risk of AK progressing to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) varies from less than 1 % to 20 %. Clinically, induration, pain, large <b>size,</b> <b>marked</b> hyperkeratosis, ulceration, bleeding, rapid growth, and recurrence or persistence may be markers of AK progression into SCC. The risk of SCC metastasizing ranges between 0. 5 % and 3 %. However, SCC of the lip arising from actinic cheilitis is more prone to metastasis than cutaneous SCC, with rates of the former varying between 3 % and 20 %. Here we report a typical case of SCC from actinic cheilitis with metastasis to the lymph nodes during a 4 -year follow-up period. To exclude SCC, we emphasize the need for regular follow-up and prompt evaluation, including careful pathologic examination for actinic cheilitis...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the grain size on the flow stress of extruded Mg– 3 Al– 1 Zn tested in compression is examined. Samples with grain sizes varying between 3 and 23 μm were prepared by altering the extrusion conditions. Compression testing of the extruded bar was carried out at temperatures between ambient and 200 °C. Twinning dominated the deformation at lower temperatures but this gave way to slip dominated flow when the temperature was raised. For tests carried out at intermediate temperatures, a similar transition was observed when the grain size was reduced. The transition {{was accompanied by a}} change in flow curve shape and Hall–Petch slope. The peak stresses achieved when twinning dominated the deformation were up to 100 MPa greater than those seen when slip dominated the flow. Critical grain <b>sizes</b> <b>marking</b> the twinning–slip transition were identified and these are described in terms of the deformation conditions. <br /...|$|R
