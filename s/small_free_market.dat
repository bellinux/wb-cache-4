He {{is best known for}} proposing the theory that Western capitalist economies have long term (50 to 60 years) cycles of boom followed by depression.

5000|$|American writer Joel Kotkin {{wrote an}} opinion piece {{originally}} published in the Orange County Register and syndicated by other publications with the title “What happened to my party?”. Kotkin criticized left-leaning Democrats who idealize Nordic-style social democracy: “The Bernie Bros and Gals think that higher taxes and more generous welfare benefits can turn America {{into a kind of}} mega-Scandinavia. They ignore the fact that, as author Nima Sanandaji has pointed out, the Nordic welfare state drew from generations of rapid growth built on <b>small</b> government, <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> and cultural factors, and that, in more recent years, countries such as Sweden have embraced a stronger free-market stance in order to pay for their generous welfare systems.” [...] Other conservatives and libertarians who referred to the book in the US include Kevin D. Williamson in the National Review, John Larabell in the The New American, Alice B. Lloyd in the Weekly Standard. Gene Epstein gave the book a positive review in Barrons.|$|R
5000|$|The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths is a 2013 {{book written}} by Mariana Mazzucato which {{argues that the}} United States' {{economic}} success {{is a result of}} public and state funded investments in innovation and technology, rather than a result of the <b>small</b> state, <b>free</b> <b>market</b> doctrine that often receives credit for the country's strong economy. Mazzucato argues that understanding the difference between the [...] "myth" [...] and the reality of this success is particularly important saying: [...] "If {{the rest of the world}} wants to emulate the US model, they should do as the United States actually did, not as they say they did". The book was listed among the Financial Times best books of the year, and was reviewed in several publications including The New York Times and The Wall Street Jornal. It is both praised and criticized by several social science journals, and has started numerous discussions among economists and social scientists around the world about the role of the state in the world of technological innovations.|$|R
5000|$|Flynn {{became an}} early and avid {{supporter}} of Senator Joseph McCarthy. This was ironic because Flynn [...] "had long ridiculed {{the idea that}} communism {{was a threat to}} America.", [...] dismissing American Communists as a tiny handful of fractious, isolated radicals who were too busy attacking each other to attack capitalism. In March, 1943, he wrote that fighting communism in America was [...] "a waste of time," [...] when the real issue was fascism, his argument in his next book, As We Go Marching (1946) which failed dismally with critics and readers alike. Four years later, Flynn published another and rather similar book, The Roosevelt Myth. By 1950 he was describing himself as a liberal in the classical liberal tradition of <b>small</b> government and <b>free</b> <b>markets,</b> but only the far right now embraced his work.|$|R
5000|$|Before 1929, she favored <b>small</b> {{government}} and <b>free</b> <b>markets.</b> She initially supported prohibition, as she later explained: [...] "I felt I should approve {{of it because}} it would help my two sons. The word-pictures of the agitators carried me away. I thought a world without liquor would be a beautiful world."Towards the 1920’s, however, Sabin realized {{that no one was}} taking Prohibition seriously. She was growing increasingly disenchanted with prohibition but worked on behalf of Herbert Hoover in the election of 1928 despite his uncertain stand on the issue. In his inauguration speech he vowed to enforce anti-liquor legislation. After the enactment of the Jones-Stalker Act in May 1929 drastically increased penalties for the violation of prohibition, she resigned from the Republican National Committee and took up the cause of repealing prohibition.|$|R

2500|$|Roger Eatwell and Neal O'Sullivan {{divide the}} right into five types: reactionary, moderate, radical, extreme and new. Chip Berlet argues {{that each of}} these [...] "styles of thought" [...] are [...] "responses to the left", {{including}} liberalism and socialism, which have arisen since the 1789 French Revolution. The reactionary right looks toward the past and is [...] "aristocratic, religious and authoritarian". The moderate right, typified by the writings of Edmund Burke, is tolerant of change, provided it is gradual and accepts some aspects of liberalism, including {{the rule of law and}} capitalism, although it sees radical laissez-faire and individualism as harmful to society. The moderate right often promotes nationalism and social welfare policies. Radical right is a term developed after World War II to describe groups and ideologies such as McCarthyism, the John Birch Society, Thatcherism and the Republikaner Party. Eatwell stresses that this use has [...] "major typological problems" [...] and that the term [...] "has also been applied to clearly democratic developments". The radical right includes right-wing populism and various other subtypes. Eatwell argues that the extreme right' has four traits: [...] "1) anti-democracy; 2) nationalism; 3) racism; and 4) the strong state". The New Right consists of the liberal conservatives, who stress <b>small</b> government, <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> and individual initiative.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{attempts}} {{to explain how}} technological innovation can soften pressure and enlarge opportunity to gain the benefit of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> competition. The <b>free</b> <b>market</b> operation becomes uncertain {{in relation to the}} domestic affairs and global circumstances. The accelerated process of moving toward <b>free</b> <b>market</b> under a domestically worsening economic situation may backfire, while slowing it down becomes backward under the globally progressing <b>free</b> <b>market</b> circumstances. In dealing with the complexity of building up competitiveness under the pressure of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> competition, we propose a model; the so-called ‘adaptive innovation policy’. The model is drawn from the metaphor of living system and its environment. The adaptive innovation is continuous enrichment of technology as the nutrition of living economic system to evolve in gaining the benefit of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> competition. The simulation results from the model imply that: i) dealing with the complexity of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> competition requires understanding the behavior of multiple feedback inside the complex economic system; ii) spurring the economic growth by capital investment beyond the carrying capacity of market could bring about economic instability; iii...|$|R
40|$|Economists {{and other}} intellectuals have debated for centuries for {{the merits of}} free trade and <b>free</b> <b>market</b> as an {{economic}} policy. Irwin (1996) wrote, " [...] . that the proposition that freedom of trade is on the whole economically more beneficial than protection, {{is one of the}} most fundamental propositions economic theory has to offer for the guidance of economic policy". However, there are questions fairness and validity in the distribution of resources and that <b>free</b> <b>market</b> is a just economic system. Adams smith theory of morality and justice is presented and analyzed in relation to his argument that <b>free</b> <b>market</b> is a just economic system. This paper will then provide critique on the morality argument for <b>free</b> <b>market.</b> John Rawls theory ofjustice will be used as a basis for criticizing the argument that the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> is a just economic system.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} long-term {{developments in}} the quality and efficiency of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> institutional systems across thirteen emerging economies from South, South-east, and East Asia over the 1995 – 2014 period. The paper also empirically assesses the impact of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> institutions on a country’s inward foreign direct investment (FDI) performance. We find that the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> institutional framework in most economies is still relatively inefficient, restrictive, and underdeveloped but has, nevertheless, substantially improved during the last twenty-year period. Our empirical results also indicate that a <b>free</b> <b>market</b> institutional system in a host-country is a factor that attracts inward FDI to emerging Asian economies by multinational companies. Consequently, policy makers should focus on further {{improving the quality of}} <b>free</b> <b>market</b> institutions...|$|R
50|$|Classical {{liberals and}} libertarians support <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> on moral, ideological grounds: {{principles}} of individual liberty morally dictate support for <b>free</b> <b>markets.</b> Supporters {{of the moral}} grounds for <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> include Ayn Rand and Ludwig von Mises. The liberal tradition is suspicious of government authority, and prefers individual choice, and hence tends to see capitalist economics as the preferable means of achieving economic ends.|$|R
50|$|Modern conservatives, on {{the other}} hand, derive support for <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> from {{practical}} grounds. <b>Free</b> <b>markets,</b> they argue, are the most productive markets.

50|$|A <b>free</b> <b>market</b> {{does not}} require the {{existence}} of competition, however it does require a framework that allows new market entrants.

Despite a surge in related research, a void exists regarding policy-related inquiries. To address this gap, we examine support of federal regulatory exemptions for UOGE using survey data collected in 2015 from two northern Colorado communities {{as part of a}} National Institutes of Health study. We assert that current regulatory exemptions for UOGE can be understood as components of broader societal processes of neoliberalization. We test whether <b>free</b> <b>market</b> ideologies relate to people’s regulatory views and find that <b>free</b> <b>market</b> ideology increases public support for federal regulatory exemptions for UOGE. We find that perceived negative impacts do not necessarily drive people to support increased federal regulation. Utilizing neo-Polanyian theory, we tested for an interaction between <b>free</b> <b>market</b> ideology and perceived negative impacts(Block and Somers 2014; Author 2015). Interestingly, <b>free</b> <b>market</b> ideology appears to moderate people’s views of regulation. <b>Free</b> <b>market</b> ideology seems to increase the effect of perceived negative impacts while simultaneously increasing support for deregulation.
