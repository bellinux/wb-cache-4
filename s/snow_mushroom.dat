50|$|The first {{ascent of}} Lautaro {{was made by}} Peter Skvarca and Luciano Pera, on January 29, 1964. They climbed the {{southeast}} ridge, encountering many crevasses, some steep ice walls, cornices, and a <b>snow</b> <b>mushroom</b> at the summit. They found an active crater and strong sulfurous emissions near the summit. The second ascent was made by Eric Jones, Mick Coffey, and Leo Dickinson on March 2, 1973, {{as part of a}} crossing of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field.|$|E
5000|$|West ridge (8 September 1978 by M.Kulig and R. Pawlowski). A very {{challenging}} route, taking three days. The {{approach is the}} same as for the southwest face but the climb goes directly up the ridge and involves hazardous climbing on <b>snow</b> <b>mushrooms</b> at the summit.|$|R
5000|$|Northeast ridge ('Spanish' route), rated TD+, was {{climbed on}} 18 July 1961 by F. Mautino, P. Acuna, A. Perez and S. Rivas. The route starts from Chopicalqui col, takes across {{the upper part}} of the Matara glacier and reaches the {{northeast}} ridge developing across cornices and <b>snow</b> <b>mushrooms.</b>|$|R

50|$|Week 12(b) - The Biggest Loser Cook-Off - This {{challenge}} was {{set by the}} trainers (Shannon and Michelle) {{to see how much}} the contestants had learnt about healthy cooking. Each contestant had 45 minutes to prepare an entrée, a main and a dessert. Each course had to include {{at least one of the}} three base ingredients: blueberries, chicken and bok choy. Shannon and Michelle would be the judges, and judge each dish on presentation and taste. The winner of the challenge would win a $4500 Everdure barbecue. Sammy presented her courses first: grilled eggplant with mushroom, cottage cheese and bok choy for entrée; stir-fried <b>snow</b> peas, carrot, <b>mushroom,</b> onion, garlic and chilli with Worcestershire and soy sauces for the main course; and carb-smart ice cream with berries and vanilla essence for dessert. Tiffany was next and presented: grilled capsicum and garlic bok choy tapas with cottage cheese for entrée; mustard chicken on a bed of lime and lemon greens for main course; and vanilla blueberries and yoghurt for dessert. Cameron then served his courses: cajun chicken and mushroom for entrée; stir-fried chicken with bok choy, cabbage, onion, carrots, capsicum, with worcestershire sauce for main course; and blueberries with yoghurt and light chocolate syrup for dessert. Sharif was the favourite to win the competition, being the best chef in the house. He first presented his entrée, baby spinach salad with cottage cheese and balsamic dressing (containing red, yellow and green capsicum, Spanish onion and cherry tomatoes), but unfortunately he forgot to put bok choy in the dish. He then presented the main course: wilted bok choy with stir-fried chicken, chilli, garlic and ginger plus a squeeze of lemon. His dessert was a punnet of blueberries with 100g of cottage cheese and a raspberry cooler on top. The judges awarded one point each to a contestant that they felt had the best dish within each course. Sammy got both points for the entrée. Tiffany got both points for the main course. For the dessert, Shannon gave a point to Tiffany and Michelle gave a point to Sharif. Therefore, Tiffany won the challenge and the barbecue with 3 points. Shannon and Michelle also awarded the Coach's Encouragement Award to Cameron because he has improved so much.|$|R
