5|$|Servo {{controlled}} subwoofers are not {{the same}} as Servodrive subwoofers whose primary mechanism of <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction</b> avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The Servodrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil (called power compression.) This feature allows high power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its Servo Drive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Late in the year, AT/Western Electric {{created a}} {{licensing}} division, Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI), to handle {{rights to the}} company's film-related audio technology. Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity, but having lapsed in its royalty payments, effective control of the rights was in ERPI's hands.

5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction.</b> A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E

The three sound field control strategies have been formulated within a consistent framework, and this has enabled insight into the physical control mechanisms. Two different three-dimensional scattering problems have then been simulated and used to investigate the performance limitations of the three strategies.

25|$|MPEG-1 frames {{contain the}} most detail in 320kbit/s mode with silence and simple tones still {{requiring}} 32kbit/s.

Frequency reproduction is always strictly {{less than half of}} the sampling frequency, and imperfect filters require a larger margin for error (noise level versus sharpness of filter), so an 8kHz sampling rate limits the maximum frequency to 4kHz, while a 48kHz sampling rate limits an MP3 to a maximum 24kHz <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction.</b> MPEG-2 uses half and MPEG-2.5 only a quarter of MPEG-1 sample rates.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Three {{dimensional}} <b>sound</b> field <b>reproduction</b> {{based on}} higher order Ambisonics requires {{the placement of}} loudspeakers on a sphere that surrounds the target reproduction region. The de-ployment of a spherical array is not trivial especially for implemen-tation in real rooms where the placement flexibility is highly desir-able. This paper proposes a design ofmultiple circular loudspeaker arrays for reproducing three dimensional sound fields originating from a limited region of interest. We apply a functional analysis framework to formulate the <b>sound</b> field <b>reproduction</b> problem in a closed form. Secondary source distributions and target sound fields are modeled as two Hilbert spaces and mapped by an integral op-erator and its adjoint operator, from which a self-adjoint operator is constructed and the singular value decomposition is applied to represent source distributions and sound fields with two sets of in-terrelated singular functions. We derive the solutions for a circular secondary source arrangement and propose the design of placing multiple circular loudspeaker arrays only over the limited region of interest. Such a design allows for non-spherical and non-uni-form loudspeaker placement and thus provides a flexible array ar-rangement. The reproduction accuracy of the proposed method is verified through numerical simulations.

25|$|A carbon {{microphone}}, {{also known}} as a carbon button microphone (or sometimes just a button microphone), uses a capsule or button containing carbon granules pressed between two metal plates like the Berliner and Edison microphones. A voltage is applied across the metal plates, causing a small current to flow through the carbon. One of the plates, the diaphragm, vibrates in sympathy with incident sound waves, applying a varying pressure to the carbon. The changing pressure deforms the granules, causing the contact area between each pair of adjacent granules to change, and this causes the electrical resistance of the mass of granules to change. The changes in resistance cause a corresponding change in the current flowing through the microphone, producing the electrical signal. Carbon microphones were once commonly used in telephones; they have extremely low-quality <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction</b> and a very limited frequency response range, but are very robust devices. The Boudet microphone, which used relatively large carbon balls, was similar to the granule carbon button microphones.|$|E
25|$|Notches {{on top of}} the {{cassette}} shell indicate the type of tape. Type I cassettes have only write-protect notches, Type II have an additional pair next to the write protection ones, and Type IV (metal) have a third set near the middle of the top of {{the cassette}} shell. These allow later cassette decks to detect the tape type automatically and select the proper bias and equalization. Virtually all recent hi-fi systems (with cassette decks) lack this feature; only a small niche of cassette decks (hi-fi separates) have the tape type selector. Playing Type II and IV tapes on a player without detection will produce exaggerated treble, {{but it may not be}} noticeable because such devices typically have amplifiers that lack extended high-frequency output. Recording on these units, however, results in very low <b>sound</b> <b>reproduction,</b> and sometimes distortion and noise is heard. Also, these cheaper units cannot erase high bias or metal bias tapes. Attempting to do so will result in an incomplete erasure. This is due to the fact that the bias levels for high and metal position require greater levels.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel <b>sound</b> field <b>reproduction</b> system using the {{simultaneous}} perturbation (SP) method and its fast convergence version.

500|$|One such problem set as a {{task for}} a genetic program was {{to design a}} {{crossover}} filter for woofer and tweeter loudspeakers. The output design was identical in topology to a design found in a patent of Zobel's for a filter to separate multiplexed low and high frequencies on a transmission line. This was judged to be human-comparable, {{not only because of}} the patent, but also because the high-pass and low-pass sections were [...] "decomposed" [...] as in Zobel's design, but not specifically required to be so in the programs parameters. Whether or not Zobel's filter design would be good for a hi-fi system is another question. The design does not actually cross over, but rather, there is a gap between the two pass-bands where the signal is not transmitted to either output.
