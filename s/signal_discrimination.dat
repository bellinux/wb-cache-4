40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel <b>signal</b> <b>discrimination</b> scheme for {{spatially}} multiplexed optical signals using a spatial intensity distribution detection technique and applies it to a space {{division multiple access}} (SDMA) in hybrid line-of-sight (hybrid– LOS) indoor optical wireless communication system. In the proposed scheme, multiple terminals simultaneously transmit their optical signals to access point (AP) using on-off-keying (OOK) modulation, and the combined optical signals are received by a photodetectors array (PD-array), where multiple PDs are disposed to observe the spatial intensity distri-bution of received signals. Because its spatial intensity distribution {{is subject to the}} signals transmitted from individual terminals, AP can identify the transmitted data by determining the transmitted spatial intensity distribution. In order to ensure a required discriminability of the transmitted intensity distributions, the proposed <b>signal</b> <b>discrimination</b> scheme is further applied to a space division and time division multiple access (SD/TDMA), and a scheduling algorithm is employed in which terminals with high discriminatory of the intensity distributions are allocated to the same time slot. Numerical results show that SD/TDMA using the proposed <b>signal</b> <b>discrimination</b> scheme increases the system throughput and the number of terminals that can access to the AP. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a joint-distribution algorithm, mainly, the {{evolutionary}} spectrum (ES) for audio <b>signal</b> <b>discrimination</b> is proposed and discussed. The purpose of audio <b>signal</b> <b>discrimination</b> {{is to build}} two different libraries: speech library and music library, from a stream of sounds. In general, the classification algorithms {{can be divided into}} three approaches: time-domain, frequency-domain, and time–frequency domain approaches. The first two approaches were discussed thoroughly in literature; however, the third approach has not yet been tested thoroughly for this type of discrimination. As audio signals are considered non-stationary, in general, the time or frequency-domain approach alone may fail in reflecting the time-varying behaviour of such signals correctly. Therefore, in this paper, the ES is proposed to solve this type of classification problem. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, some simulation and comparisons with classical methods are done, where the Colombia SMD database is used...|$|E

40|$|We analyze fiscal rules {{within a}} Monetary Union in the {{presence}} of (i) asymmetric information on member states' potential output and (ii) bail-out among member states. The first-best deficit is contingent on the cycle, that is, on member states' output gap. In the presence of asymmetric information and bailout, the first-best deficit is not implementable. Bail-out lowers the scope for <b>signalling</b> (<b>discrimination)</b> by member states (lenders) and induces overborrowing by member states characterized by a low output gap. The Monetary Union can design a mechanism such that a member state with a smaller negative output gap runs an optimal budget deficit upon receiving a transfer form the Union. We show that, this 'cyclically-contingent' fiscal framework Pareto dominates the 'cyclically-adjusted' fiscal rule currently enforced by the European Monetary Union. Our model can then account for a situation where both asymmetric information over cyclical positions and the presence of bail-out among member states does not induce borrowing distortions...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{parametric}} and non-parametric schemes for discrete time <b>signal</b> <b>discrimination</b> are considered. Discrete time <b>signal</b> <b>discrimination</b> {{is the problem}} of classifying a random discrete time signal into one of two classes. The term discrimination arises from the more specific problem where the two classes are a target of interest and a decoy target. In this thesis we consider both parametric and non-parametric schemes for discriminating between the two classes. In Chapter 2, we assume that first and second order probability density functions (pdfs) of the data under each class are known. Using these pdfs optimal memoryless quantizer discriminators are constructed. In Chapter 3, it is assumed that the pdfs are not know. Utilizing kernel density estimators and samples data from each class, estimates of the pdfs are formed for each class. Optimal memoryless quantizer discriminators are then constructed using the estimated pdfs and the expressions from Chapter 2. In Chapter 4, a perceptron neural network is trained with a supervised learning algorithm using sample data from each class. The perceptron neural network is utilized by a discriminator which uses memory. Results for simulated radar data are presented for all schemes. Results show that the neural network discrimination scheme performs significantly better than the memoryless quantization schemes...|$|E

Currently, Breslow Index {{is measured by the}} anatomopathologist after the visible tumour has been biopsied. Non-invasive measurement of Breslow Index using optical methods would turn the overall procedure into a one-step process thus reducing morbidity, cost and system burden. In the current study spatially-resolved Diffuse Reflectance (DR) Spectroscopy (using five Collection to Excitation Separations - CEFS) was evaluated as a tool to discriminate several Breslow Index simulated by phantoms. Those phantoms were made of two layers: the bottom and the top layers were made so as to simulate respectively dermis and melanoma optical coefficients optical coefficients. Dermis was considered as being mainly scattering (intralipids mixed with gelatin) and melanoma was considered as being both scattering and absorbing because of melanin (intralipids and coffee mixed within gelatin).

40|$|Perceptual biases can {{shape the}} {{evolution}} of signal form. Understanding the origin and direction of such biases is therefore crucial for understanding signal evolution. Many animals learn about species-specific <b>signals.</b> <b>Discrimination</b> learning using simple stimuli varying in one dimension (e. g. amplitude, wavelength) can result in perceptual biases with preferences for specific novel stimuli, depending on the stimulus dimensions. We examine how this translates to discrimination learning involving complex communication signals; birdsongs. Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) were trained to discriminate between two artificial songs, using a Go/No-Go procedure. The training songs in experiment 1 differed {{in the number of}} repeats of a particular element. The songs in experiment 2 differed in the position of an odd element in a series of repeated elements. We examined generalization patterns by presenting novel songs with more or fewer repeated elements (experiment 1), or with the odd element earlier or later in the repeated element sequence (experiment 2). Control birds were trained with only one song. The generalization curves obtained from (i) control birds, (ii) experimental birds in experiment 1, and (iii) experimental birds in experiment 2 showed large and systematic differences from each other. Birds in experiment 1, but not 2, responded more strongly to specific novel songs than to training songs, showing ‘peak shift’. The outcome indicates that learning about communication signals may give rise to perceptual biases that may drive signal evolution...|$|R

Pseudo candidates handed their resumes to a random worker in the restaurants for the resume to be forwarded to the manager, which removed the effect of first impression on the employer. Also, the resumes were written in a three-level scale based on the qualifications of the pseudo applicants and resumes for each qualification level were delivered in three separate weeks. The results showed that male applicants were favored significantly. Men had higher interview callbacks or job offers. In addition, men did even better in high-pay restaurants compared to low-pay ones. In the low-price restaurants, for each man who received a job offer, the woman was rejected 29 percent of the time. There were no such cases where a man did not get the job offer but a woman did. In the high-priced restaurants, when the man got an offer, the woman was rejected 43 percent of the time. The same pattern that <b>signaled</b> <b>discrimination</b> was observed for the interviews. At the high-priced restaurants, women had 40 percent less chance of being interviewed and 50 percent less chance of receiving the job. Therefore, based on this study, it is correct to conclude discrimination in the same job may lead to gender wage discrimination. Note the high-priced restaurants are more likely to offer higher wages and higher tips for its workers compared to those with low prices.|$|R

40|$|QC 351 A 7 no. 65 The {{significance}} of signal-dependent noise is discussed. Particular {{emphasis is placed}} on the type of multiplicative noise present in the density variations in a photographic emulsion. A theoretical treatment of the effect of multiplicative noise on signal detection and <b>signal</b> <b>discrimination</b> problems is presented. Optimum test statistics are derived for processing a sampled message to detect the presence of a known signal. Multiplicative noise described by Poisson and Gaussian statistics is considered. The expressions are extended to include the two-signal discrimination problem. Two-dimensional signal fields in the presence of multiplicative noise are simulated in a computer and processed for optimum signal detection according to the two derived methods. These results are compared to the results of processing based on the assumption of stationary noise statistics. This comparison reveals that modest improvements (20 % to 30 % reduction in false alarm rate) are obtained when the signal-dependent nature of the noise statistics is considered. The effects of signal-to-noise ratio, signal structure, and changing background level are also investigated. An example of optimum <b>signal</b> <b>discrimination</b> using circles and squares as signals in multiplicative noise is reported. An improvement in the percentage of correctly identified signals is again observed when the proper test statistic is used. Two examples of signal filtering in the presence of signal-dependent noise are included. The first concerns the processing of a real star field to determine the location of weak stars. The second is an illustration of the signal information contained in the noise spectrum of a message recorded on a common photographic film...|$|E

Sites are characterized using geophysical sensing devices and locations are identified where possible UXO may be located. In practice, based on {{the analysis of the}} geophysical surveys, a dig list of N suspect locations is created for a site that is possibly contaminated with UXO. The suspect locations on the dig list are often assigned into K bins ranging from ``most likely to contain UXO" to ``least likely to be UXO" based on <b>signal</b> <b>discrimination</b> techniques and expert judgment. Usually all dig list locations are sampled to determine if UXO is present before the site is determined to be free of UXO. While this method is 100 % certain to insure no UXO remains in the locations identified by the <b>signal</b> <b>discrimination</b> and expert judgment, it is very costly. This paper proposes a statistical Bayesian methodology that may result in digging less than 100 % of the suspect locations to reach a pre-defined tolerable risk, where risk is defined in terms of a low probability that any UXO remains in the unsampled dig list locations. Two important features of a Bayesian approach are that it can account for uncertainties in model parameters and that it can handle data that becomes available in stages.
