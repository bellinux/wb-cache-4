2500|$|Various tools {{have been}} {{developed}} to make hand-knitting easier. [...] Tools for measuring needle diameter and yarn properties have been discussed above, as well as the yarn swift, ballwinder and [...] "yarntainers". [...] Crochet hooks and a darning needle are often useful in binding/casting off or in joining two knitted pieces edge-to-edge. [...] The darning needle is used in duplicate stitch (also known as Swiss darning). The crochet hook is also essential for repairing dropped stitches and some specialty stitches such as tufting. [...] Other tools such as knitting spools or pom-pom makers are used to prepare specific ornaments. [...] For large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools {{have been developed}} to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters. [...] A second potential difficulty is that the knitted piece will slide off the tapered end of the needles when unattended; this is prevented by [...] "point protectors" [...] that cap the tapered ends. [...] Another problem is that too much knitting may lead to hand and wrist troubles; for this, special <b>stress-relieving</b> gloves are available. In traditional Shetland knitting a special belt is often used to support the end of one needle allowing the knitting greater speed. Finally, there are sundry bags and containers for holding knitting, yarns and needles.|$|E

The marginal state of jammed and <b>stress-relieved</b> networks are globally isostatic, while marginal randomly diluted networks show both overconstrained and underconstrained regions. When a single bond is added to or removed from these isostatic systems, jammed networks become globally overconstrained or floppy, whereas the effect on <b>stress-relieved</b> networks is more local and limited. These differences are also reflected in the linear elastic properties and point to the highly effective and unusual role of global self-organization in jammed sphere packings.

5000|$|Any {{machining}} process on a barrel, whether it's boring, rifling, or turning the outside contour, will produce some {{stress in the}} steel of the barrel.

Prior to the welding, the material was double tempered at 538 C (1, 000 F). After welding, only part of the material was stress relieved at 510 C (950 F) for 3 h. Round tensile specimens obtained from nonstress-relieved material were tested in 100 -percent relative humidity at 38 C (100 F), in 3. 5 -percent NaCl alternate immersion, and in 5 -percent salt spray at 35 C (95 F).

5000|$|One of the {{theories}} on the specific formation mechanism for bainite is that it occurs by a shear transformation, as in martensite.

5000|$|Proper heat {{treating}} requires precise control over temperature, time {{held at a}} certain temperature and cooling rate. With the exception of <b>stress-relieving,</b> tempering, and aging, most heat treatments begin by heating an alloy beyond the upper transformation (A3) temperature. This temperature {{is referred to as}} an [...] "arrest" [...] because at the A3 temperature the metal experiences a period of hysteresis. At this point, all of the heat energy is used to cause the crystal change, so the temperature stops rising for a short time (arrests) and then continues climbing once the change is complete. Therefore, the alloy must be heated above the critical temperature for a transformation to occur. The alloy will usually be held at this temperature long enough for the heat to completely penetrate the alloy, thereby bringing it into a complete solid solution.|$|E

50|$|Testosterone {{is a high}} {{affinity}} ligand for and agonist of {{the nuclear}} androgen receptor (AR). In addition, testosterone binds to and activates membrane androgen receptors (mARs) such as GPRC6A and ZIP9. Testosterone is also potentiated via transformation by 5α-reductase into the more potent androgen DHT in so-called androgenic tissues such as the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, skin, and hair follicles. In contrast {{to the case of}} testosterone, such potentiation occurs to a reduced extent or not at all with most synthetic AAS (as well as with DHT), and this is primarily responsible for the dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effects with these agents. In addition to DHT, testosterone is converted at a rate of approximately 0.3% into the estrogen estradiol via aromatase. This occurs in many tissues, especially adipose tissue, the liver, and the brain, but primarily in adipose tissue. Testosterone, after conversion into DHT, is also metabolized into 3α-androstanediol, a neurosteroid and potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, and 3β-androstanediol, a potent and preferential agonist of the ERβ. These metabolites, along with estradiol, may be involved in a number of the effects of testosterone in the brain, including its antidepressant, anxiolytic, <b>stress-relieving,</b> rewarding, and pro-sexual effects.|$|E

It was found that the stress relieving treatment does not change the tensile strength of the high Ni alloy.
