25|$|Core damage {{frequency}} (CDF) is a {{term used}} in probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) that indicates the likelihood of an accident that would cause severe damage to a nuclear fuel in nuclear reactor core. Core (severe) damage accidents are considered extremely serious because severe damage to the fuel in the core prevents adequate heat removal or even safe shutdown, {{which can lead to}} a nuclear meltdown. Some sources on CDF consider core (severe) damage and core meltdown to be the <b>same</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> different methods of measurement are used between industries and nations, so the primary value of the CDF number is in managing the risk of core accidents within a system and not necessarily to provide large-scale statistics.|$|E
