METHODS: We investigated the association between stress fractures and age, sex, sports level, sports activity, and skeletal site in athletes seen at our sports medicine clinic between September 1991 and April 2009. Stress fractures of the pars interarticularis were excluded from this analysis. RESULTS: During this period (18 years and 8 mo), 14276 patients (9215 males and 5061 females) consulted our clinic because of sports-related injuries, and 263 patients (1. 8 %) [171 males (1. 9 %) and 92 females (1. 8 %) ] <b>sustained</b> <b>stress</b> fractures. The {{average age of the}} patients with stress fractures was 20. 2 years (range 10 - 46 years); 112 patients (42. 6 %) were 15 - 19 years of age and 90 (34. 2 %) were 20 - 24 years of age. Altogether, 90 patients (34. 2 %) were active at a high recreational level and 173 (65. 8 %) at a competitive level. The highest proportion of stress fractures was seen in basketball athletes (21. 3 %), followed by baseball (13. 7 %), track and field (11. 4 %), rowing (9. 5 %), soccer (8. 4 %), aerobics (5. 3 %), and classical ballet (4. 9 %). The most common sites of stress {{fractures in}} these patients were the tibia (44. 1 %), followed by the rib (14. 1 %), metatarsal bone (12. 9 %), ulnar olecranon (8. 7 %) and pelvis (8. 4 %). The sites of the stress fractures varied from sport to sport. The ulnar olecranon was the most common stress fracture site in baseball players, and the rib was the most common in rowers. Basketball and classical ballet athletes predominantly <b>sustained</b> <b>stress</b> fractures of the tibia and metatarsal bone.

40|$|We have {{previously}} identified the RNA recognition motif (RRM) -type RNA-binding protein Nrd 1 {{as an important}} regulator of the posttranscriptional expression of myosin in fission yeast. Pmk 1 MAPK-dependent phosphorylation negatively regulates the RNA-binding activity of Nrd 1. Here, we report the role of Nrd 1 in stress-induced RNA granules. Nrd 1 can localize to poly(A) -binding protein (Pabp) -positive RNA granules in response to various stress stimuli, including heat shock, arsenite treatment, and oxidative stress. Interestingly, compared with the unphosphorylatable Nrd 1, Nrd 1 (DD) (phosphorylation-mimic version of Nrd 1) translocates more quickly from the cytoplasm to the stress granules in response to various stimuli; {{this suggests that the}} phosphorylation of Nrd 1 by MAPK enhances its localization to stress-induced cytoplasmic granules. Nrd 1 binds to Cpc 2 (fission yeast RACK) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and deletion of Cpc 2 affects the formation of Nrd 1 -positive granules upon arsenite treatment. Moreover, the depletion of Nrd 1 leads to a delay in Pabp-positive RNA granule formation, and overexpression of Nrd 1 results in an increased size and number of Pabp-positive granules. Interestingly, Nrd 1 deletion induced resistance to <b>sustained</b> <b>stresses</b> and enhanced sensitivity to transient stresses. In conclusion, our results indicate that Nrd 1 plays a role in stress-induced granule formation, which affects stress resistance in fission yeast...|$|E
40|$|This work {{illustrates}} a theoretical model developed {{to reproduce the}} behaviour of ancient masonry subjected to <b>sustained</b> <b>stresses.</b> Starting from a model recently proposed by the authors, two damage tensors have been introduced into a rheological model: the components of these tensors change both according to {{the intensity of the}} applied stress and, in case of sustained stress, to the duration of the load history. Evolution laws found in the literature for brittle materials have been employed. The principal directions of damage are meant to represent the directions of the experimental cracks; accordingly, when any damage direction is activated, it remains unchanged throughout the subsequent load history. The presence of second-order damage tensors makes it possible to describe the damage-induced anisotropy of the microcracked material. Also, since the possible increase of damage in time is accounted for, the model is able to describe creep failure and to predict the creep time to failure of the material under given stresses. The model parameters can be obtained through uniaxial creep tests on masonry samples at increasing stress levels and up to failure. The model was implemented into a finite element code, and structural analyses were carried out to assess the safety of middle-age masonry towers. The results obtained for one of these towers are briefly described and discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} in acoustic emission (AE) as a monitoring technique {{to assess the}} damage evolution in masonry structures is recently gaining field. The AE technique detects transient energy waves emitted by a material {{as a result of}} stress redistributions.

In this paper, the focus is on long-term monitoring and the use of AE-monitoring to assess damage evolution under <b>sustained</b> <b>stresses,</b> such as damage-accumulation during creep phenomena in masonry.

Both sources of data are used to validate the AE-monitoring technique to assess the damage accumulation.

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{investigation}} of a long-seam welded low chrome pipe that failed in a high-temperature refinery piping system are presented in this paper. Based upon {{the results of a}} metallurgical investigation, which included a creep testing program and a detailed finite element stress analysis, the cause of the failure has been attrib-uted to creep damage at the weld seam. The metallurgical investigation and creep testing program indicated that the 1 - ^ O- j Mo pipe material was normalized and exhibited greater than average creep strength and creep ductility. The results of a piping stress analysis indicated that all pressure, weight, and thermal stresses were in compliance with the ASME B 31. 3 Piping Code (ASME, 1993 a). Nonetheless, the pipe failed after only 100, 000 h at a nominal hoop stress of 6 ksi (41. 4 MPa) with an operating temperature range of 970 °F (521 °C) to 1000 °F (538 °C). Results from subsequent detailed finite element stress analyses of the failed pipe indicated that very high localized bending stresses were present in the pipe due to peaking at the long-seam weld. These stresses partially relax by creep, but after 100, 000 h they were still approximately 38 percent higher than the nominal hoop stress. The creep strains resulting from stress relaxation and those associated with the long-term value of the <b>sustained</b> <b>stresses</b> cause severe creep damage at the weld seam. As a result of this damage, cracks initiated at the inside of the pipe and primarily grew through the HAZ/fusion line until an 18 -in. through-wall crack developed. The pipe was produced to ASTM A 691, Grade l-l 4 Cr, Class 41 (ASTM, 1989), and the peaked geometry was found to satisfy the fabrication tolerances of this standard. The need for the development of an acceptable tolerance for peaking in addition to the outside diameter and out-of-roundness fabrication tolerances currently included in this stan-dard is highlighted for long-seam welded pipe that is to operate in the creep range...|$|E
40|$|In environments of high {{moisture}} exposure, carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) reinforcement {{is believed}} to be a good alternative to steel due to its non-corrosive properties. However the CFRP matrix experiences other types of changes, mechanical deterioration and transverse swelling, with exposure to moisture and <b>sustained</b> <b>stresses.</b> Specifically for structural applications, few studies have investigated the effects of moisture and stress-induced matrix-dominated changes to the CFRP-concrete bond when the CFRP rods are cast into concrete as prestressed reinforcement. Experiments were conducted to measure the transverse swelling and moisture uptake rates of stressed and unstressed CFRP rods immersed in water and concrete pore solution (CPS). CFRP rods were also embedded in concrete and immersed in water to observe whether the transverse swelling of the rods would cause the concrete to crack. Pull-out tests were conducted on stressed and unstressed CFRP rods cast in concrete cubes and immersed in water for up to 125 days. Six CFRP prestressed concrete prisms were fabricated, three were immersed in water for over 125 days and three were left in lab conditions before being tested in three-point bending. Moisture-induced transverse swelling did not appear to cause cracking of the concrete covering CFRP rods in water, contrary to the prediction of the thick-walled cylinder model, but possibly caused an increase in the CFRP-concrete radial contact pressure. The imposition of sustained bending stresses on wet CFRP rods was found to cause premature failure, believed to be a result of matrix softening and microcracking. These observations of swelling and matrix degradation were believed to affect the CFRP-concrete bond. The pull-out tests of unstressed CFRP rods indicated an increased likelihood for bond failure in the CFRP matrix with moisture exposure. This resulted in greater variations in the ultimate and residual bond stresses of the wet samples compared to the dry controls. For the prestressed pull-out samples, higher magnitudes of prestressing resulted in lower bond failure loads. Both outcomes are indicative of matrix weakening with moisture and stress exposure. However despite this, the three-point bending tests revealed no significant differences in behaviour between the wet and dry prestressed prisms. Although the wet prisms exhibited slightly greater variation in their post peak load behaviour compared to the dry prisms, in line with the observations from the pull-out tests. The work from this thesis reveals that despite observations of matrix deterioration and transverse swelling in CFRP rods exposed to moisture and stress, the effect of these changes to the overall behaviour of a CFRP prestressed concrete member are minimal. Any long-term effects are unlikely to cause significant changes to the behaviour of the member. However, the CFRP-concrete bond may be more variable in members exposed to moisture, which should be allowed for in the design process. Therefore CFRP is a promising alternative to steel reinforcement in high moisture environments, with good long-term durability...|$|E

The importance of structural monitoring within this process is generally accepted. Ongoing research at the Building Materials and Building Technology Division of the Civil Engineering department of K. U. Leuven focuses on 3 different non-destructive monitoring techniques, namely: 3 D laser scanning, acoustic emission and geo-electrical measurements: •	 3 D-laserscanning: The stability of masonry vaults very much depends on its overall geometry and the analysis results strongly depend on the accuracy in which this geometry {{can be measured in}} practice. To obtain an accurate estimate of the geometry of the vaults, 3 D-laserscanning was performed. Based on the 3 D point cloud, a 3 D-model of the vaults allows determining the lines of thrust in the structure as well as the reaction forces (application point and magnitude) at the abutments. This contribution gives a critical appraisal of the process used in the preliminary research phase: gathering the point-clouds, 3 D-modelling, structural analysis calculating thrust lines and the consolidation requirements that are obtained. The focus is on the added value of the methodology, its applicability, cost-effectiveness, overall advantages and drawbacks; •	The interest in acoustic emission (AE) as a monitoring technique to assess the damage in masonry structures is gaining field recently. The AE technique, detects transient energy waves emitted by a material as a result of stress redistributions. Therefore, the technique requires an external load to be imposed on the structure, such as a mechanical, thermal or chemical loading. In this paper, the focus is on long term monitoring and the use of AE-monitoring to assess damage evolution under <b>sustained</b> <b>stresses,</b> such as damage accumulation during creep phenomena in masonry. Additional diffulties are encountered that come from the complex masonry layout and the monitoring time frame. In order to gain more insight in the use of AE-monitoring in this field, a laboratory test campaign is set up. Several long term tests are performed on different types of masonry at different stress levels. The latter are increased at specific time intervals. In addition to stress-strain and crack monitoring, AE-monitoring is performed at discrete moments in time. Both sources of data are used to validate the AE-monitoring technique to assess the damage accumulation. Hereby, both damage initiation due to load increment and the damage accumulation due to time-dependent plastic deformation under sustained loading were assessed. Focus is both on the added value and limitations of the AE for damage assessment, with an appraisal towards its applicability for on site NDT monitoring; •	geo-electrical measurements: A geophysical resistivity measuring device was modified to perform automatic monitoring of historical masonry structures before, during and after grout injection for consolidation purposes. The obtained image is called a geo-electrical tomography. The technique was used to evaluate the deteriorated masonry of the recently partly collapsed Maagdentoren in Zichem, Belgium. The results of these measurements are dis-cussed. An important improvement is the adaptation of the “cross-borehole” measurement technique for masonry. With this technique, a constant resolution in depth is achieved. Laboratory tests, using an adaptation of the “cross-borehole” technique, enabled to show the resistivity distribution changing during the injection of a test specimen with a hydraulic grout. Focus is on how these structural monitoring techniques are a tool to help in the structural understanding of often complex historical buildings. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The In situ Compression of Annealed Molybdenum Nanopillars in the Transmission Electron MicroscopebyMatthew LowryDoctor of Philosophy in Engineering - Materials Science and EngineeringUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Andrew Minor, Co-chairProfessor J. W. Morris, Jr., Co-chair	The {{compression}} of {{focused ion beam}} (FIB) machined metallic pillars with submicron diameters offers {{a unique opportunity to}} explore dislocation behavior in a limited volume. This data is of particular interest due to the recent observation of an apparent size effect in the {{compression of}} metallic pillars. More specifically, metallic pillars with diameters on the order of microns and below have shown elevated yield stresses, elevated flow stresses, stochastic yield point fluctuations, and large strain bursts relative to the bulk. By harnessing the resolution of the transmission electron microscope (TEM) and performing the compressions in situ in the TEM, it is possible to directly observe dislocation behavior during compression and thereby help to explain the source of the size effect. Moreover, the results from in situ compressions {{can be used as a}} comparison point for theoretical models that also attempt to explain the dislocation behavior leading to the size effect. 	Standing in the way of performing such compressions in situ in the TEM is the high density of defects imparted by FIB milling, in particular the high density of dislocations. The dislocations are too dense to see individual dislocation behavior, limiting the utility of the TEM. This dissertation details efforts to remove dislocations from FIB-milled molybdenum by in situ annealing in the TEM, thereby unlocking the FIB as a sample preparation technique for in situ TEM studies of mechanical properties. 	To that end, three classes of pillars were prepared from molybdenum by FIB-milling and subsequent in situ annealing in the TEM: as-fabricated pillars, fully annealed pillars, and partially annealed pillars. As-fabricated pillars were simply milled and then directly compressed without any annealing. The fully annealed pillars, on the other hand, were annealed such that nearly all dislocations were driven from the pillars, leaving either zero or a few isolated dislocations. The pillars in the final class, those that were partially annealed, were annealed such that the dislocation density was reduced but a significant density remained. Each class of pillar displayed a distinct mechanical response under subsequent in situ compression in the TEM, in which load-displacement data was collected in tandem with visual data from the TEM. 	It was found that as-fabricated pillars behaved much the same as ex situ tests performed by others, displaying the size effect already reported. Moreover, the high density of defects made it difficult to interpret dislocation behavior, as it was not possible to discern the motion of individual dislocations. On the other end of the spectrum, the fully annealed pillars behaved as pristine crystals, loading elastically until sudden catastrophic collapse. Using a Hertzian analysis, it was found that fully annealed pillars <b>sustained</b> <b>stresses</b> approaching the ideal strength of molybdenum. Finally, the partially annealed pillars behaved in an intermediate manner, displaying limited plasticity akin to fully annealed pillars when the dislocation density was low, and widespread plasticity corresponding to the size effect when the density was higher. Ultimately, it was found that through annealing, it is possible to explore dislocation behavior in pillars with a wide range of dislocation densities. Moreover, the FIB can also be used in future studies of mechanical behavior in limited volumes without necessarily being limited by the initial dislocation density imparted by the FIB...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{was concerned with}} the response of plain concrete when subjected to repeated or sustained high compressive loads. The objectives were: (1) to study the strength and deformation characteristics of concrete under such loading conditions, and (2) to propose an analytical procedure to predict concrete behavior under high repeated loads. The first objective was realized through an experimental program. Plain concrete prisms (4 in. by 4 in. by 12 in.) were subjected to high repeated and sustained loads. Compressive loads were concentrically applied. Strains in the longitudinal and lateral directions were recorded throughout {{the life of a}} specimen. The test program was divided into three phases. Phase One dealt with the effect of maximum stress, stress range and concrete age at time of loading. Phase Two concerned with the effect of speed of testing on static and repeated load behavior. The relationship between the damage, caused by high repeated and sustained loads, less than those necessary to cause failure, and the remaining load carrying capacity of a specimen, was studied in Phase Three. To achieve the second objective, two analytical models were formulated. These were based on the cycle and time-dependence of damage and of strains of concrete when subjected to high repeated or <b>sustained</b> <b>stresses.</b> For a given set of parameters, a damage model was proposed to predict the number of cycles required to cause failure, while a failure strain model was developed to predict the total longitudinal strain accumulated at failure. The experimental program showed that concrete response to high repeated loads is very much controlled by the time concrete has to resist stresses higher than its sustained load strength. For a maximum stress higher than the sustained load strength, a decrease in the stress range and /or the stress rate (test frequency) significantly increases the “sustained load” contribution to the overall behavior. The number of cycles to failure are smaller, and the exhibited strains throughout the loading history and at failure are larger, the greater the “sustained load” effect. Even if the effect of hydration during a test is excluded, concrete age at loading appears to {{have a significant effect on}} behavior of concrete subjected to high loads. In addition, it was shown by experiment that plain concrete, subjected to high repeated and sustained loads, undergoes a “hardening” stage manifested by an increase in the static strength over the static strength prior to sustained or repeated load test. This “hardening” is dominant during the earlier portion of the life of the specimen. The last portion is characterized by progressive crack propagation and a stress decrease until failure. In the analytical study, a damage model was developed in which the cycle and time-dependent effects are expressed separately. The damage model was revised successively until excellent agreement, between calculated and observed failure cycles, was achieved. Also, an analytical model to determine the failure strain model was derived. The total strain was assumed to consist of an initial elastic strain, a cycle-dependent and a time-dependent strain. The agreement between calculated and observed failure strains ranged from poor to satisfactory, but the failure strains, calculated from the analytical model, gave the general tendencies which were observed in the experiments.

These findings take into account both tensile and compressive forces, with tensile forces increasing growth rate and compression decreasing activity in the growth plate. The effect on the growth plate by dynamic load is under debate as growth rate has been reported as either being decreased or unaffected [7].

The damage accumulation approach has been widely used for this purpose to set engineering standards. In this article, we revisit an accumulated damage model and propose a Bayesian framework for analysis. For parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification, we adopt approximation Bayesian computation (ABC) techniques to handle the complexities of the model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using both simulated and real data, and apply our fitted model to analyze long-term lumber reliability under a stochastic live loading scenario...|$|R
