Further, the complex wave speed of an unstable <b>subsonic</b> <b>wave</b> is shown to lie in a semiellipse-type region in the upper half plane.

First, for fixed, sufficiently large <b>subsonic</b> <b>wave</b> speeds, we rigorously prove the existence of a family of travelling wave solutions. Second, it is shown that this family of solutions gives rise to a kinetic relation which depends on the jump in the oscillatory energy in the solution tails.

40|$|Propagation {{of sound}} in a {{flexible}} duct is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Strong coupling {{of sound and}} flexural waves on the duct wall is found when the wall-to-air mass ratio is {{of the order of}} unity. The axial phase speed of sound approaches the in vacuo speed of flexural <b>waves</b> (<b>subsonic</b> in this case) at low frequencies. However, a speed higher than the isentropic sound speed in free space (340 m/s) is found beyond a critical frequency which {{is a function of the}} mass ratio. Experiments using a duct with a finite section of tensioned membrane are compared with the propagating modes pertaining to the infinite membrane model. Satisfactory quantitative agreement is obtained and the measured phase speed ranges from 8. 3 to 1348 m/s. In the moderate frequency range, the theory predicts high spatial damping rate for the <b>subsonic</b> <b>waves,</b> which is consistent with the experimental observation that <b>subsonic</b> <b>waves</b> become increasingly undetectable as the frequency increases. Substantial sound reflection is observed at the interface between the rigid and the flexible segments of the duct without cross-section discontinuity, which, together with the high spatial damping, could form a basis for passive control of low-frequency duct noise.

40|$|Modern {{configurations}} of aircraft {{deal with a}} high performance design of lifting systems especially oriented to reduction of drag and fuel consumption. An important requirement of civil aircraft is the commercial velocity, so a reduction of drag in cruise condition leads to optimized configuration satisfying both economic and pollution restrictions. The paper shows preliminary results of aerodynamic and structural analyses carried out at the Department of Aerospace Engineering of Pisa University during last three years on a high aspect ratio wing with a curved planform. The wing configuration arises from an early first author idea while all the analyses shown in the paper have been executed by young students in aeronautics. From the aerodynamic point of view curved planform causes a variable swept angle along the wing span: so in transonic flight condition (high <b>subsonic)</b> <b>wave</b> drag effects are strongly reduced. Numerical comparison between curved and traditional swept wing, both designed with similar aerodynamic profiles, shows a strong reduction (5 %- 10 %) of drag coefficient under high subsonic flight conditions. Moreover the curved planform configuration improves aeroelastic behaviors of the wing: in the paper some preliminary results obtained using NASTRAN code are summarized. With similar wing box metallic structures the flutter velocity, at the sea level, of curved configuration increase considerably {{with respect to the}} traditional swept wing.

40|$|UnrestrictedLoss factor {{measurements}} {{were performed on}} sandwich panels {{to determine the effects}} of different skin and core materials on the acoustical properties. Results revealed inserting a viscoelastic material in the core's mid-plane resulted in the highest loss factor. Panels constructed with carbon-fiber skins exhibited larger loss factors than glass-fiber skins. Panels designed to achieve <b>subsonic</b> <b>wave</b> speed did not show a significant increase in loss factor above the coincidence frequency. The para-aramid core had a larger loss factor value than the meta-aramid core.; Acoustic absorption coefficients were measured for honeycomb sandwiches designed to incorporate multiple sound-absorbing devices, including Helmholtz resonators and porous absorbers. The structures consisted of conventional honeycomb cores filled with closed-cell polyurethane foams of various densities and covered with perforated composite facesheets. Honeycomb cores filled with higher density foam resulted in higher absorption coefficients over the frequency range of 50 - 1250 Hz. However, this trend was not observed at frequencies greater than 1250 Hz, where the honeycomb filled with the highest density foam yielded the lowest absorption coefficient among samples with foam-filled cores.; The energy-recycling semi-active vibration suppression method (ERSA) was employed to determine the relationship between vibration suppression and acoustic damping for a honeycomb sandwich panel. Results indicated the ERSA method simultaneously reduced the sound transmitted through the panel and the panel vibration. The largest reduction in sound transmitted through the panel was 14. 3 % when the vibrations of the panel were reduced by 7. 3 %.; The influence of different design parameters, such as core density, core material, and cell size on wave speeds of honeycomb sandwich structures was experimentally analyzed. Bending and shear wave speeds were measured and related to the transmission loss performance for various material configurations. The shear modulus of the core showed maximum influence on the wave speeds of the samples, while cell size did not have a significant influence on wave speeds or on transmission loss. Skin material affected wave speeds only in the pure bending regime. Honeycomb sandwich structures with a subsonic core and thus reduced wave speed showed increased transmission loss compared to samples without a subsonic core...|$|E

Apart from the hydrodynamic Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) wave, the spatial growth rates of the acoustically coupled supersonic and <b>subsonic</b> instability <b>waves</b> are computed for axisymmetric conditions (m= 0) to analyse their role on the jet stability, under increased heating and compressibility. With the ambient stationary, supersonic instability waves may exist for any jet Mach number M-j >= 2, whereas the <b>subsonic</b> instability <b>waves,</b> in addition, require the core-to-ambient flow temperature ratio T-j/T-o > 1. We show, for moderately heated jets at T-j/T-o > 2, the acoustically coupled instability modes, once cut on, to govern the overall jet stability with the K-H wave having disappeared into the cluster of acoustic modes. Sufficiently high heating makes the subsonic modes dominate the jet near-field dynamics, whereas the supersonic instability modes form the primary Mach radiation at far field...|$|R

Functional Wiener-Hopf equation is obtained and the diffraction problem is solved using the Fourier transform and the saddle point method. Analytic expressions for the non attenuating <b>subsonic</b> surface <b>wave</b> travelling on the elastic plate and the scattered field are obtained.

In the theoretical framework, the regularization process of shock waves mediated by the quantum pressure term is purely dispersive. Our results show good agreement with the experiment of Joseph et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 150401 (2011) ].

By both imaging and probing the evanescent acoustic field, we show that these interfacial waves are guided waves known as quasi-Scholte acoustic waves. Scholte waves present very interesting features for applications in acoustofluidics. Namely, they confine the acoustic energy to the vicinity of the surface, they are nearly lossless and thus can propagate over long distances along the substrate, and finally they do not require any particular material for the substrate.

We find that using a single ideal gas EOS for both regions, as used in previous works, yields large errors in describing the shock wave. We use the fact that the solution is composed of two different self-similar solutions, one for the ablation region and one for the shock, and apply two ideal gas EOS (binary-EOS), one for each region, by fitting a detailed tabulated EOS to power laws at different regimes.
