In this paper a bi-level model is developed to optimize the route structure, frequency setting and fare structure simultaneously. The upper level problem is to maximize the operator’s profit while the lower level problem is an approach-based SUEED transit assignment model. An artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is proposed to solve determine the route structure and a sensitivity analysis-based algorithm is proposed to find out the optimal frequency and fare settings. Numerical examples with discussions will be presented to investigate the behavior of the model and to examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Comparison on three different fare structures, i. e., flat fare, distance based fare and <b>sectional</b> <b>fare</b> is made...|$|E

If a {{passenger}} gets on the bus after a specified stop that situates further away {{from the start of the}} route, he/she may pay less. Furthermore, passengers of routes 14, 15 and N8P may also pay less if they do not wish to travel the entire length of the route.|$|R
50|$|These are {{medium to}} long routes, {{travelling}} on trunk roads, for example, national highway G107, using full-sized transit buses. The buses are cyan in colour. These routes are charged {{according to the}} distance of the route, from 2 RMB to 10 RMB, if the full fare is greater than 3 RMB, <b>sectional</b> <b>fares</b> and manual fare collection are used, with short-haul passengers paying only 2 RMB. Renumbered routes in this category start with M, for example, M206 and M408, and most of the routes in the old numbering scheme fall into this category, e.g. 1 and 337.|$|R
