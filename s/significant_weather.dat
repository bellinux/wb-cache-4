5|$|Despite their rarity, hurricanes {{are among}} Arizona's most <b>significant</b> <b>weather</b> makers. In years when Arizona is {{affected}} by a tropical cyclone, these can be responsible for up to 25% of the rainfall in areas along the Colorado River. Arizona hurricanes are also responsible for torrential rains in localized areas, with the state's 24-hour rainfall record— of precipitation—occurring during Hurricane Nora's landfall in 1997. The heavy rainfall can trigger extensive flash floods, {{such as the ones}} produced by the remnants of Tropical Storm Octave in 1983, or the lingering moisture from Tropical Storm Emilia in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The average {{salinity}} of Earth's oceans {{is about}} 35grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt). Most of this salt {{was released from}} volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks. The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential {{for the survival of}} many aquatic life forms. Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir. Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause <b>significant</b> <b>weather</b> shifts, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.|$|E
5|$|Weather fronts are {{boundaries}} between two masses of air of different densities, or different temperature and moisture properties, which normally are convergence zones {{in the wind}} field and are the principal cause of <b>significant</b> <b>weather.</b> Within surface weather analyses, they are depicted using various colored lines and symbols. The air masses usually differ in temperature and may also differ in humidity. Wind shear in the horizontal occurs near these boundaries.|$|E

Examinations of variability of <b>significant</b> severe <b>weather</b> environments are presented for five active severe weather regions in the U. S. Regional comparisons illustrate significant environments have changed little over the period of record. Significant severe environments are then verified by <b>significant</b> severe <b>weather</b> reports to ensure climatologies presented herein are indeed representative of observations. Reports indicate that environments calculated by reanalysis tend to overestimate the actual distribution of reports, likely due to the absence of accounting for a lifting mechanism. On average, reanalysis calculated <b>significant</b> severe <b>weather</b> environments closely mimic the annual cycle of <b>significant</b> severe <b>weather</b> reports. Additionally, analysis the Arctic Oscillation's impact on <b>significant</b> severe <b>weather</b> reports in the Midwest also conducted. While the Arctic Oscillation alone shows little skill in predicting <b>significant</b> severe <b>weather</b> reports, further studies should incorporate additional teleconnection indices, as many factors must work in concert to produce a <b>significant</b> severe <b>weather</b> event...|$|R

50|$|The thermal {{heat from}} {{wildfire}} can cause <b>significant</b> <b>weathering</b> {{of rocks and}} boulders, heat can rapidly expand a boulder and thermal shock can occur. The differential expansion of a thermal gradient can {{be understood in terms}} of stress or of strain, equivalently. At some point, this stress can exceed the strength of the material, causing a crack to form. If nothing stops this crack from propagating through the material, it will result in the object's structure to fail.|$|R
5|$|A cold-core low, {{also known}} as an upper level low or cold-core cyclone, is a cyclone aloft which has an {{associated}} cold pool of air residing at high altitude within the Earth's troposphere. It is a low pressure system that strengthens with height {{in accordance with the}} thermal wind relationship. If a weak surface circulation forms in response to such a feature at subtropical latitudes of the eastern north Pacific or north Indian oceans, it is called a subtropical cyclone. Cloud cover and rainfall mainly occurs with these systems during the day. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, can occur near the center of cold-core lows. Cold lows can help spawn cyclones with <b>significant</b> <b>weather</b> impacts, such as polar lows, and Von Karman Vortices. Cold lows can lead directly to the development of tropical cyclones, owing to their associated cold pool of air aloft or by acting as additional outflow channels to aid in further development.|$|E

50|$|The statue shows <b>significant</b> <b>weathering,</b> {{suggesting}} that it stood exposed to the elements {{for a long time}} before being buried. Other anthropomorphic statues of the early Iron Age have been found in Rottenburg, Tübingen, Stammheim and Stockach (all Baden-Württemberg, Germany), but they are far more stylised, more carving than statue. In the following La Tène period, anthropomorphic statues are still very rare, but examples include the finds from Glauberg (Hessen, Germany), Holzgerlingen (Baden-Württemberg, Germany), the Mšecké Žehrovice Head (Bohemia), and the sculptures at Roquepertuse.|$|R
30|$|Other {{groups of}} {{columnar}} jointed colonnades occur in MMNG.

25|$|The Scottish {{football}} referee strike {{refers to}} the unprecedented withdrawal of services by top level referees in Scottish football, following a dispute between the Scottish Senior Football Referees' Association and the Scottish Football Association. It affected 20 matches scheduled for the weekend of 27/28 November 2010 in the Scottish Premier League, the Scottish Football League, the Scottish Cup, {{as well as the}} 2010 Scottish Challenge Cup Final. When combined with <b>significant</b> <b>weather</b> disruption, the effect of the strike was that only four games went ahead, all in the SPL on 27 November, using replacement referees drawn from Israel, Luxembourg and Malta. It was the first time since 1905 that a domestic Scottish match had been refereed by someone from outside Scotland.|$|E

50|$|A rarity for January in the Midwest, {{the first}} <b>significant</b> severe <b>weather</b> {{event of the}} year {{developed}} in the Central U.S on January 7. Over 70 tornadoes were reported that day, including major tornadoes dominated by two supercell areas.|$|R
25|$|In 2004 {{two more}} storm chaser tools emerged. The first, WxWorx, {{was a new}} XM Satellite Radio based system {{utilizing}} a special receiver and Baron Services weather software. Unlike preexisting cellular based services there was no risk of dead spots, and that meant {{that even in the}} most remote areas storm chasers still had a live data feed. The second tool was a new piece of software called GRLevel3. GRLevel3 utilized both free and subscription based raw radar files, displaying the data in a true vector format with GIS layering abilities. Since 2006 a growing number of chasers are using Spotter Network (SN), which uses GPS data to plot real time position of participating spotters and chasers, and allows observers to report <b>significant</b> <b>weather</b> as well as GIS layering for navigation maps, weather products, and the like.|$|E

The first tropical cyclone developed in the Southern Hemisphere during June 28, before it later developed into Tropical Cyclone Raquel during June 30.The second tropical cyclone was first noted by the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) as a tropical disturbance during June 25, while it was located about [...] to the south-southeast of Pohnpei State in the Federated States of Micronesia.|$|E
500|$|There are two {{different}} meanings used within meteorology to describe weather around a frontal zone. [...] The term [...] "anafront" [...] describes boundaries which show instability, meaning air rises rapidly along and over the boundary to cause <b>significant</b> <b>weather</b> changes. [...] A [...] "katafront" [...] is weaker, bringing smaller changes in temperature and moisture, as well as limited rainfall.|$|E
50|$|Thermal stress {{weathering}} comprises {{two main}} types, thermal shock and thermal fatigue. Thermal stress weathering {{is an important}} mechanism in deserts, {{where there is a}} large diurnal temperature range, hot in the day and cold at night. The repeated heating and cooling exerts stress on the outer layers of rocks, which can cause their outer layers to peel off in thin sheets. The process of peeling off is also called exfoliation. Although temperature changes are the principal driver, moisture can enhance thermal expansion in rock. Forest fires and range fires are also known to cause <b>significant</b> <b>weathering</b> of rocks and boulders exposed along the ground surface. Intense localized heat can rapidly expand a boulder.|$|R

500|$|Fronts are the {{principal}} cause of <b>significant</b> <b>weather.</b> Convective precipitation (showers, thundershowers, and related unstable weather) is caused by air being lifted and condensing into clouds by {{the movement of the}} cold front or cold occlusion under a mass of warmer, moist air. [...] If the temperature differences of the two air masses involved are large and the turbulence is extreme because of wind shear and the presence of a strong jet stream, [...] "roll clouds" [...] and tornadoes may occur.|$|E
500|$|During World War II, radar {{technology}} {{was developed to}} detect aircraft. [...] It soon became apparent that large areas became obscured when <b>significant</b> <b>weather</b> was in the area. [...] In 1957, the National Weather Service established the United States' first radar network to cover the coastline and act as first warning of an impending tropical cyclone. [...] Upgraded in the 1990s to use doppler technology, radar can provide rainfall estimates, wind estimates, possible locations of tornadoes within a system's spiral bands, {{as well as the}} center location of a tropical cyclone.

40|$|In November of 1998, an {{expedition}} from Carnegie Mellon University travelled to the Patriot Hills, Antarctica. The {{purpose of the}} expedition was to demonstrate autonomous navigation and robotic classification of meteorites and the characterization of various robotics technologies in a harsh, polar setting. This paper presents early results of experiments performed on this expedition with CCD cameras and laser range finders. It evaluates the ability of these sensors to characterize polar terrain. The effect of weather on this characterization is also analyzed. The paper concludes with a discussion on the suitability of these sensors for Antarctic mobile robots. 1.
