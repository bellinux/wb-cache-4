2500|$|An Antislavery {{meeting was}} held at Broadway Hall, in Broadway, above Howard Street, next to the famous Tattersalls. That large, quaint {{building}} stood gable end to the street, and its sloping roof descended just below the side windows of the hall of the meeting. Among other noted speakers Mr Garrison was present; while the exercises were progressing, an onslaught was made upon the meeting by the [...] "plug-uglies," [...] and other ruffians, sworn to exterminate the Abolition fanatics. Armed with sticks and clubs, and with a furious noise, they rushed upon the terrified audience, aiming particularly, however, at the rostrum and the speakers. Mr Garrison was safely got away {{through one of the}} side windows. George Bourne stood forth to receive the [...] "Tammany Braves," [...] and placing his cane before him with hands extended he said, [...] "Stand back, ye villains! What do you want here? Stand back I say!" [...] The leaders and the advancing band stood <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in astonishment and mute admiration of the courage of the burly looking [...] "dominie," [...] whose splendid physique and fearless eye showed them an undaunted foe. At last one of them swung his hat and cried out [...] "Three cheers for the dominie!" [...] which they gave with a will, and leaving him unmolested, they chased out the remainder of the audience, who were glad to escape without personal violence.|$|E
60|$|He hesitated <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{then moved}} to obey her will.|$|E
60|$|Holderness stood <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> There was a queer {{look in his}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|Wyllard started, but {{he stood}} very <b>still</b> again <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two.|$|R
60|$|Gertrude sat very <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> {{her lips}} tightly pressed together. Then {{she made a}} gesture of weariness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I'm made to {{turn right}} side up again. <b>Still,</b> this-- <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> I could half believe {{there never was}} a world." ...|$|R
60|$|Arranmore sat quite <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Then he rose {{slowly to}} his feet.|$|E
60|$|She sat <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> She {{was looking}} towards the deserted cricket pitch.|$|E
60|$|Stella sat quite <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and {{a slight}} frown was on her forehead.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy sat <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> with {{trouble in}} his face, which {{was hard and}} grim, until his comrade turned to him again.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Travers {{stepped back}} a few paces and gazed up at the house. All was <b>still.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> he stood {{listening}} and then re-joined the boatswain.|$|R
60|$|He stood {{perfectly}} <b>still</b> listening <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Then {{he was on}} {{the point}} of stealing away, when a hand fell suddenly upon his shoulder. He was face to face with Mr. Sabin.|$|R
60|$|His blood stood <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Then {{the smile}} came again within him, steady, cruel.|$|E
60|$|The {{woman stood}} <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> looking at him. Then {{she drew a}} step nearer.|$|E
60|$|She was <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> then knelt very swiftly {{before him}} and held out her arms.|$|E
60|$|There was keen {{relief in}} Osborneâ€™s face, and the {{slackness}} of his pose suggested the sudden relaxing {{of a heavy}} strain. He sat very <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> and then got up.|$|R
60|$|Graham {{struggled}} {{up until}} {{he stood by}} his companion's side. The latter stood quite <b>still,</b> listening <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Then he climbed a little higher and swung around, holding out his hand once more.|$|R
6000|$|Marianne stood <b>still</b> {{in amazement}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and then exclaimed, 'Jane, Jane! {{you do not}} mean it, you are only trying to tease me.' ...|$|R
60|$|JAYSON--[Testily.] Keep <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Lily, for God's sake. This is no {{subject to}} joke about, remember.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge sat quite <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> He brows were knitted, {{he showed}} no signs of nervousness.|$|E
60|$|She sat quite <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two, {{looking through}} the glass-paneled door. Then she shrugged her shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Jane was {{scarcely}} conscious of her cousin's departure, or of Esther's arrival, but after drinking some water, and lying <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> she exclaimed, 'Oh, Robert! oh, Esther! the confirmation!' and gasped and sobbed again. Esther {{thought she had}} guessed the cause of her tears, and tried to comfort her.|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir John {{produced}} the letter {{which she had}} written to Caldigate, and {{in which she had}} distinctly offered to marry Crinkett if the money demanded were paid. She must have expected the production of this letter, but <b>still,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> it silenced her. 'Yes,' she said, at last, 'I wrote it.' ...|$|R
60|$|Nasmyth lay very <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> {{resting on}} one elbow among the wineberries, for she had, after all, only {{suggested}} a question that had once or twice troubled him. It was, however, characteristic of {{him that he had}} temporized, and, though he knew it must be answered some day, had thrust it aside.|$|R
60|$|Julien stood quite <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> His {{pale face}} seemed {{suddenly}} whiter, {{his eyes were}} full of fire.|$|E
60|$|He {{remained}} perfectly <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{then made}} Razumov's leaden heart strike a ponderous blow by springing up briskly.|$|E
60|$|Reist stood very <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and the pallor on {{his cheeks}} {{was more than the}} pallor of exhaustion.|$|E
6000|$|But he took no heed of the affront which I {{had offered}} to him merely to assert my authority. <b>Still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> he stared {{although}} the sparks from the wood were frizzling in his greasy hair, then of a sudden went down on his face before me, as did all the others and cried out, ...|$|R
60|$|Perhaps Celia {{had never}} turned so pale before. The paper man {{she was making}} would have had his leg injured, but for her {{habitual}} care of whatever she held in her hands. She laid the fragile figure down at once, and sat perfectly <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments.</b> When she spoke there was a tear gathering.|$|R
60|$|He went out, {{and on his}} way to {{the mill}} stood <b>still,</b> and wished <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that he had responded yet more kindly, and kissed her once at least.|$|R
60|$|I stood <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> The raging {{and tearing}} {{of the sea}} below had {{momentarily}} triumphed over the north wind.|$|E
60|$|Blanche stood quite <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> The sun {{was in her}} eyes, and {{she lowered}} her parasol for a moment.|$|E
60|$|The plump woman blanched {{and stood}} <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> A stick {{fell out of}} the bundle in her hand unheeded.|$|E
60|$|The {{delirium}} had returned. Julius's voice {{kept her}} <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> but she broke out afresh {{at his first}} pause, and murmurs fell thick and fast from her tongue, mixing the names of her brother and Raymond with railings at Mrs. Poynsett for slights {{in the days when}} the mother was striving to discourage the inclination that resulted in the engagement.|$|R
60|$|Dr. May stood <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> {{then gave}} one long gasp, {{made a few}} inquiries, {{and went up to}} Aubrey's room. The boy was fast asleep; but there was that about him which {{softened}} the weary sharpness of his father's manner, and caused him to desire Ethel to look from the window whence she could see whether the lights were out in Dr. Spencer's house. Yes, they were.|$|R
60|$|The brave girl's heart almost stopped beating from joy, as she {{set about}} her preparations. She was not <b>still</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single <b>moment,</b> but danced about the house, turning chests and {{wardrobes}} upside down. She set aside enough things <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole year--dresses embroidered with gold and precious stones, {{and a great}} store of provisions. And she chose the most spirited horse in the stable, with eyes of flame, and a coat of shining silver.|$|R
