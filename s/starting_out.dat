5|$|After {{leaving the}} band Society's Finest, {{in which he}} played guitar, vocalist Tim Lambesis formed As I Lay Dying in 2000. <b>Starting</b> <b>out</b> as a duet with drummer Jordan Mancino, they first met as a band in February 2001. They both were in the {{hardcore}} punk band Point of Recognition. The band's name came from the novel {{of the same name}} by William Faulkner that was published in 1930; although the band's lyrics and music are not directly inspired by the novel.|$|E

5|$|In {{the more}} general case where the firm cannot price {{discriminate}} between domestic and foreign consumers {{the effects of a}} subsidy are less clear since both an expansion of exports and deterioration of terms of trade are present.

5|$|In {{the second}} half, Parker scored his third {{touchdown}} of the game—surpassing his touchdown total {{for the entire}} 2007 season—and was named the AFC offensive {{player of the week}} for his performance. Pittsburgh's defense held Houston to sixyards on their ensuing drive and the Steelers drove 80yards to take a 35–3 lead. The Texans scored two touchdowns in the final quarter, but Pittsburgh's James Harrison led the team with three sacks—forcing a fumble on the third—and the Steelers won their first game of the season <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> 1–0.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most young}} American men of this era, Bart King came to cricket {{only after first}} playing baseball. He began to play club cricket at Tioga Cricket Club in 1888, aged 15, <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> as a batsman. Tioga {{was one of the}} lesser Philadelphian cricket clubs. King played his first {{recorded}} match for the club in 1889, when he was tried as a bowler due to his physique. He took 37 wickets for 99 runs for the club in the 1889 cricket season.|$|E
50|$|When a new player <b>starts</b> <b>out,</b> their {{character}} <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> at Level 1, while the RNPCs {{he or she}} recruits <b>start</b> <b>out</b> at various levels.

5|$|After graduating Coffin {{was unable}} to find work with {{established}} architectural firms, due to widespread prejudice against a woman working in a male-dominated field. She set up her own practice in New York City in 1905, <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> by designing suburban gardens on Long Island. Her increasing fame led to larger commissions from wealthy and powerful East Coast families. By the 1920s {{she was one of the}} most sought-after landscape architects in the eastern United States. Coffin's clientele included some of the wealthiest and most famous families in the country, including the Fricks, the Vanderbilts, the Huttons, and the du Ponts.|$|E

5|$|After <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> in the Delhi junior system, Kartik {{moved through}} the age group ranks at Railways, was {{selected}} for the Indian Under-19 team. He made his first-class debut in 1996–97 {{and after a few}} productive seasons at domestic level, made his Test debut in early-2000 as Kumble's bowling partner. However, he ran into disciplinary problems and was expelled from the National Cricket Academy in the same year, while new national captain Sourav Ganguly was reluctant to entrust him with responsibility. Ganguly called for off spinner Harbhajan to be recalled in 2001, and was rewarded with a series-winning performance against Australia. This entrenched the off spinner in the team and left Kartik on the outer.|$|E
5|$|In {{their early}} years, Leicester played at {{numerous}} grounds, but have only played at two since {{they joined the}} Football League. When first <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> they played on a field by the Fosse Road, hence the original name Leicester Fosse. They moved from there to Victoria Park, and subsequently to Belgrave Road. Upon turning professional the club moved to Mill Lane. After eviction from Mill Lane the club played at the County Cricket ground while seeking a new ground. The club secured {{the use of an}} area of ground by Filbert Street, and moved there in 1891.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the game}} was {{supposed}} to be developed for the PlayStation 3, but due to the long wait for the PS3, {{the game was}} developed for the PlayStation 2 instead. From the outset, the games director Hideo Kojima wished to drastically change the setting from previous games. He stated that the jungle setting is what both his development team, and the Metal Gear fans, wanted. However, he acknowledged that the elements of a jungle environment, such as the weather, landscape and wildlife, were features that would present problems during the game's development. Whereas in previous installments the player starts out close to, or even within, the enemy base, Kojima wished Snake Eater to be more realistic, with Snake <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> miles from civilization and having to work his way to the enemy encampment.|$|E

He gained combat sport experience by earning black belts in both judo and jujutsu, and he moved to Edmonton, Alberta to train as a wrestler. He made his debut in Edmonton and wrestled in several matches there before moving to Tampa, Florida. <b>Starting</b> <b>out,</b> he wrestled for Independent Pro Wrestling, making $30 per match or less and sometimes competing in exchange for food and drinks. Juggernaut became known for his hardcore wrestling abilities, but he also impressed observers with his ability to perform a moonsault.|$|E
5|$|Royal Arsenal renamed {{themselves}} {{for a second time}} upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with The Football League when the club ascended later that year. Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of The Football League, <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> in the Second Division and winning promotion to the First Division in 1904. Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910. Businessmen Henry Norris and William Hall became involved in the club, and sought to move them elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|This modest {{beginning}} {{developed in}} time into {{the formation of}} the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, the only United Kingdom charity to promote the protection of wetland birds and their habitats, both in Britain and internationally. Although <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> at Slimbridge, the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust now owns or manages eight other reserves in Britain, and advocates for wetlands and conservation issues world-wide. WWT Consulting is an offshoot of the Wildlife & Wetland Trust and is based at Slimbridge. It provides ecological surveys and assessments, and offers consultancy services in wetland habitat design, wetland management, biological waste-water treatment systems and the management of reserves and their visitor centres. The Queen in later years became Patron to the WWT, and Prince Charles became the President.|$|E
5|$|Bolt {{claimed his}} first major world medal two months later at the IAAF World Athletics Final in Stuttgart, Germany. He passed the {{finishing}} post {{with a time of}} 20.10 s, gaining a bronze medal in the process. The IAAF World Cup in Athens, Greece, yielded Bolt's first senior international silver medal. Wallace Spearmon from the United States won gold with a championship record time of 19.87 s, beating Bolt's respectable time of 19.96 s. Further 200 m honours on both the regional and international stages awaited Bolt in 2007. He yearned to run in the 100 metres but Mills was skeptical, believing that Bolt was better suited for middle distances. The coach cited the runner's difficulty in smoothly <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> of the blocks, and poor habits such as looking back at opponents in sprints. Mills told Bolt that he could run the shorter distance if he broke the 200 m national record. In the Jamaican Championships, he ran 19.75 s in the 200 m, breaking the 36-year-old Jamaican record held by Don Quarrie by 0.11 s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Starting</b> <b>out</b> in a {{black and}} white frame (and later {{incorporating}} scenes of color), a group of girls are seen standing outside on the street while Bieber is seen exiting a building while trying to walk away without getting noticed. This however, is unsuccessful as the girls run up to Bieber; he then takes pictures and signs autographs with the girls. While this is happening Bieber takes an interest with one particular girl asking her to meet him later on, to which she agrees. As the song starts playing Bieber is seen sitting in an empty auditorium playing the piano and singing. When Bieber's date shows up they sneak into an empty theater where they are seen; holding hands, horsing around on the theater's seats, and sliding down banisters. At the ending of the video they are seen engaging in a playful back-alley water fight and eventually collapse into each other's arms while Bieber is playing the piano back inside the theater.|$|E
