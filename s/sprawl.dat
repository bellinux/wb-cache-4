5|$|Dinosaurs {{belong to}} a group known as archosaurs, which also {{includes}} modern crocodilians. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodilians <b>sprawl</b> out to either side.|$|E
5|$|Ground {{temperature}} measurements, {{like most}} weather observations, are logged by location. Their siting predates the massive <b>sprawl,</b> roadbuilding programs, and high- and medium-rise expansions which {{contribute to the}} UHI. More importantly, station logs allow sites in question to be filtered easily from data sets. Doing so, the presence of heat islands is visible, but overall trends change in magnitude, not direction.|$|E

5|$|London's vast {{urban area}} is often {{described}} using a set of district names, such as Bloomsbury, Mayfair, Wembley and Whitechapel. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by <b>sprawl,</b> or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs.|$|E
5|$|Long term {{proposals}} by {{the province}} call for Highway 404 {{to be extended}} to Highway12, between Sunderland and Beaverton. This extension would follow a new alignment to Port Bolster, east of which the freeway would incorporate the existing two lanes of Highway48. It has drawn criticism from various environmental groups who claim it will only serve to accelerate urban <b>sprawl</b> north of Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Other approaches, {{loosely based}} around New Urbanism, are {{successfully}} reducing environmental impacts by altering {{the built environment}} to create and preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts {{across a range of}} measures, compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban <b>sprawl.</b> Both trends started in the 1980s. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban <b>sprawl.</b>|$|E

5|$|Urban <b>sprawl</b> {{and habitat}} {{destruction}} have adversely affected Gila monster numbers. In 1952, {{they became the}} first venomous animal to be given legal protection.

5|$|A {{study by}} the National Audubon Society has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have {{plummeted}} since 1967, with some species showing a decline of 80 percent. The {{study also found that}} California species were particularly affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the northern pintail, horned lark and loggerhead shrike. The decline may be due to loss of habitat to urban <b>sprawl,</b> especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate change could compound losses in the future.|$|E
5|$|Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have {{frequently}} been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both {{set in the}} <b>Sprawl</b> trilogy universe, have been loosely adapted as films: Johnny Mnemonic (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and Takeshi Kitano, and New Rose Hotel (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former {{was the first time}} in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a CD-ROM interactive video game. , Vincenzo Natali still hoped to bring Neuromancer to the screen, after some years in development hell. Count Zero was at one point being developed as The Zen Differential with director Michael Mann attached, and the third novel in the <b>Sprawl</b> trilogy, Mona Lisa Overdrive, has also been optioned and bought. An anime adaptation of Idoru was announced as in development in 2006, and Pattern Recognition was in the process of development by director Peter Weir, although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project. Announced at International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2015 is an adaptation of Gibson's short story Dogfight by BAFTA award-winning writer and director Simon Pummell. Written by Gibson and Michael Swanwick and first published in Omni in July 1985, the film is being developed by British producer Janine Marmot at Hot Property Films.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{ecoregion}} remains ecologically intact, {{it faces}} conservation challenges {{that include the}} negative affects of certain forestry management and logging practices, higher risks of forest fires due to the alteration of the trees {{that make up the}} forest composition, and habitat fragmentation as a result of urban <b>sprawl</b> and development, which endangers the long-term survival of vulnerable species such as mountain caribou and the Northern goshawk.|$|E
5|$|Between {{two thirds}} and three {{quarters}} of the population live in urban areas. Switzerland has gone from a largely rural country to an urban one in just 70 years. Since 1935 urban development has claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it did during the previous 2,000 years. This urban <b>sprawl</b> does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills and there are growing concerns about land use. However, {{from the beginning of the}} 21st century, the population growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|Reactions {{to the new}} freeway {{were not}} all positive. In a special {{editorial}} in The Grand Rapids Press after the freeway opened in 2004, local resident Curt MacDougall summarized the criticisms of the new freeway. He cited the loss of rural farmland and wetlands as a negative effect of the highway. The editorial also discussed that the freeway does decrease travel times for some residents, but it will mean increased development. That development will mean further urban <b>sprawl,</b> and could spur the creation of additional highways in the area.|$|E

Since oil was discovered, the state's economy has reflected {{the state of the}} petroleum industry. In recent times, urban centers of the state have increased in size, containing two-thirds of the population in 2005. The state's economic growth has led to urban <b>sprawl</b> and its associated symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The 1993 {{annexation}} made London one of {{the largest}} urban municipalities in Ontario. Intense commercial and residential development is presently occurring in the southwest and northwest areas of the city. Opponents of this development cite urban <b>sprawl,</b> destruction of rare Carolinian zone forest and farm lands, replacement of distinctive regions by generic malls, and standard transportation and pollution concerns as major issues facing London. The City of London is currently the eleventh-largest urban area in Canada, eleventh-largest census metropolitan area in Canada, and the sixth-largest city in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sprawl</b> trilogy was {{followed}} by the 1990 novel The Difference Engine, an alternative history novel Gibson wrote in collaboration with Bruce Sterling. Set in a technologically advanced Victorian era Britain, the novel was a departure from the authors' cyberpunk roots. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991 and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1992, and its success drew attention to the nascent steampunk literary genre of which it remains the best-known work.|$|E

This lack of space causes demand for dense, high-rise offices and housing. Thirty-six of the world's 100 tallest residential buildings are in Hong Kong. More people in Hong Kong live or work above the 14th floor than anywhere else on Earth, making it the world's most vertical city.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposals}} to extend the O-Bahn to Golden Grove or build other routes, however none have progressed beyond consultation. An extension to Golden Grove would require the acquisition of extensive tracts of private property, due to the absence of an available corridor. Population increase in the area is negligible, although <b>sprawl</b> continues from Tea Tree Plaza Interchange for another eight kilometres to the Adelaide Hills. The current route was built with an allowance for a station at Grand Junction Road but it has not been built.|$|E
5|$|Urban <b>sprawl,</b> air {{and water}} pollution, noise, light pollution, {{and a range of}} habitat {{restricted}} by human infrastructure put stress on the park's mammals and other animals, but the most serious immediate threat to them is roadkill. About 50,000 vertebrates a year die on the park's roads when they are hit by a vehicle. The RMD has few roads, but Picture Rocks Road, an east–west commuter highway crossing the TMD, is highly dangerous to wildlife. Attempts in 2002 to convert it to a hiking trail failed after the proposal met with stiff public resistance.|$|E
