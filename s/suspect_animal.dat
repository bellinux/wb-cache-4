40|$|A {{presumptive}} diagnosis of heartwater {{in the living}} animal can be based on clinical and epidemiologic observations. In Guadeloupe, heartwater can be confused with haemonchosis in goats or cerebral babesiosis in cattle. Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis by brain biopsy is useful in experimental infections but is hardly applicable in the field. Positive results were obtained from 92 % of animals 16 to 18 days after experimental infection. In febrile animals the best results were obtained between the 3 rd and 6 th days of the thermal response. Diagnosis can also be supported by serological tests. These are useful for monitoring experimental infections and for checking recovered animals in the field. Nineteen goats out of 27 were negative on Day 1 of the febrile reaction but positive a week later. The remaining 8 goats were positive on Day 1 and had greatly increased antibody titres a week later. Confirmation of a diagnosis can also be achieved by subinoculating into susceptible animals either blood or suspensions of ticks collected from suspect animals and then homogenized. Ticks that have engorged on a <b>suspect</b> <b>animal</b> can be allowed to moult and then fed on a susceptible animal to test their infectivity. These methods are time consuming but useful for heartwater surveys. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundA confirmatory rabies {{diagnosis}} can {{be achieved}} by rapid virus isolation in cell culture using brain tissue from the <b>suspect</b> <b>animal.</b> Several cell lines have been used for this purpose and the murine neuroblastoma cell line Neuro- 2 a {{has been found to be}} the most sensitive. The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK- 293 is known to express several neuronal proteins and is believed to be of neuronal origin. We hypothesized that this cell line could be susceptible to rabies virus, which is highly neurotropic. MethodsFirst we tested the sensitivity of HEK- 293 cells to the laboratory strain, challenge virus standard (CVS). We then tested 120 brain samples from different animals and humans suspected to have died of rabies by fluorescent antibody test (FAT). Both FAT-positive and FAT-negative brains were tested for virus isolation using Neuro- 2 a, BHK- 21, and HEK- 293 cell lines and also by mouse inoculation. ResultsThere was 100 % correlation between FAT, virus isolation in Neuro- 2 a and HEK- 293 cells, and mouse inoculation. However, the rate of virus isolation in the BHK- 21 cell line was only 28 % when compared to the other cell lines. The sensitivity of HEK- 293 to CVS strain of virus was similar to that of Neuro- 2 a. ConclusionsWe conclude that the HEK- 293 cell line is as sensitive as the Neuro- 2 a cell line for the rapid isolation of rabies virus and may serve as an alternative cell line for rabies diagnosis and future research...|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} {{has been}} tackled for decades by costly eradication programs in most developed countries, involving the laboratory testing of tissue samples from allegedly infected animals for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) members, namely Mycobacterium bovis. Definitive diagnosis is usually achieved by bacteriological culture, which may {{take up to}} 6 - 12 weeks, during which the <b>suspect</b> <b>animal</b> carcass and herd are under sanitary arrest. In this work, a user-friendly DNA extraction protocol adapted for tissues was coupled with an IS 6110 -targeted semi-nested duplex real-time PCR assay to enhance the direct detection of MTC bacteria in animal specimens, reducing the time to achieve a diagnosis and, thus, potentially limiting the herd restriction period. The duplex use of a novel β-actin gene targeted probe, with complementary targets in most mammals, allowed the assessment of amplification inhibitors in the tissue samples. The assay was evaluated {{with a group of}} 128 fresh tissue specimens collected from bovines, wild boars, deer and foxes. Mycobacterium bovis was cultured from 57 of these samples. Overall, the full test performance corresponds to a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 98. 2 % (CIP 95 % 89. 4 - 99. 9 %) and 88. 7 % (CIP 95 % 78. 5 - 94. 7 %), respectively. An observed kappa coefficient was estimated in 0. 859 (CI P 95 % 0. 771 - 0. 948) for the overall agreement between the semi-nested PCR assay and the bacteriological culture. Considering only bovine samples (n = 69), the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were estimated in 100 % (CIP 95 % 84. 0 - 100 %) and 97. 7 % (CIP 95 % 86. 2 - 99. 9 %), respectively. Eight negative culture samples exhibiting TB-like lesions were detected by the semi-nested real-time PCR, thus emphasizing the increased potential of this molecular approach to detect MTC-infected animal tissues. This novel IS 6110 -targeted assay allows the fast detection of tuberculous mycobacteria in animal specimens with very high sensitivity and specificity, being amenable and cost effective for use in the routine veterinary diagnostic laboratory with further automation possibilities...|$|E

40|$|A {{tissue culture}} system for {{detecting}} rabies virus from saliva samples of <b>suspected</b> <b>animals</b> {{was developed and}} compared to suckling mouse inoculation. Swab samples {{were obtained from the}} mouth of the animal heads received for rabies diagnosis; these swabs were submerged in maintenance medium. The maintenance medium was inoculated intracerebrally into suckling mice and onto BHK- 21 cells with diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) -dextran (BHK/DEAE) and without (BHK). Rabies immunofluorescence was performed on the brain of the mice dying during the observation period and also on both tissue culture systems every day after infection. The BHK-DEAE system detected 28 positive samples obtained from 48 rabid animals and the BHK system detected 18. By suckling mouse inoculation only 11 of the same positive samples were detected. A total of 90 samples was studied by the three methods. Rabies virus was detected by the tissue culture methods earlier than by suckling mouse inoculation.

50|$|Under most situations, {{infection}} {{is hard to}} recognize because the symptoms are mild or even absent. In humans and wild animals, {{infection is}} not easily identified.

Diagnosis basically relies on a combination of postmortem analyses, clinical signs displayed by the animals, and response to drenching. In heavy infection, symptoms are easily observed in sheep and cattle as they become severely anorexic or inefficiently digest food, and become unthrifty. Copious fetid diarrhea is an obvious indication, as the soiling of hind legs and tails with fluid feces are readily noticeable.
