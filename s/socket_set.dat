At the hearing, a forensic technician testified that blood matching Nina Reiser's DNA {{had been found}} on a bag in Hans Reiser's car, and on a pillar in his mother's (Beverly Palmer's) house, {{where he had been}} living since the separation. It later emerged that a mistake had been made when the police analysed the blood on the pillar, rendering the evidence inconclusive. Police also testified that they had found a 40-piece <b>socket</b> <b>set</b> which may have been used to remove the passenger seat, a receipt for the purchase of the <b>socket</b> <b>set</b> from Kragen Auto Parts, four seat bolts, and a ratchet wrench with a socket on it, suggesting that the seat may have been removed recently.

5000|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} interchangeable sockets is that, {{instead of a}} separate wrench {{for each of the}} many different fastener sizes and types, only separate sockets are needed for each size and type. Because of their versatility, nearly all screw and bolt types now have sockets of different types made to fit their bolts or nuts. Sockets often come as a [...] "socket set" [...] with many different sizes or types of sockets to fit the heads of different-sized fasteners.

Zatrachydids are distinguished by lateral (sideways) bony protuberances of the quadratojugal bone of the skull, and a large opening in the palate. The skull is flattened, with small orbits or eye <b>sockets</b> <b>set</b> far back. The opening in the palate may have housed a gland for producing a sticky substance so that prey would adhere to the tongue.

Behind this horse are two men who seem to be threatening it, one with a long stick like the handle of a brush or rake, the other with a besom broom (blurred). The one with the stick wears white trousers, a dark jacket and a top hat; his face is disguised, perhaps by a mask or possibly wrapped in cloth. The other has a dark jacket and a flat-topped, ornate hat that looks like a smoking cap; he may be wearing a mask or perhaps a painted-on beard; his legs cannot be seen.|$|E
5000|$|Some sockets are {{designed}} {{to have the same}} outside diameter and shape within a given set size. Each pass-through socket, within a given <b>socket</b> <b>set,</b> is designed to be used with a [...] "special" [...] ratchet that fits {{on the outside of the}} socket and not to the middle of the socket. By fitting the outside of the socket they allow the bolt or stud to extend through the socket, eliminating the need for a deep socket in some applications. By attaching to the outside of the socket they also allow the socket to be built up to 50% shorter and with 20% less width which is an advantage in some situations. Pass-through sockets and ratchets are built for 1/4", 3/8" [...] and 1/2" [...] sets in both SAE and metric sizes. By using a fine tooth ratchet and socket system that allow a pass-through ratchet to be used as a conventional ratchet handle with interchangeable 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch drives some ratchets can be used with standard sockets. They are built by a number of manufacturers with a variety of trade names. Craftsman Tools call theirs--Max Axess, and also sells GearWrench's Pass-Thru brands. Lowes calls their socket system Xtreme Access, etc.. Ratcheting box end wrenches can often be employed in the same application but will nearly always be significantly wider.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{design a}} {{framework}} that implements security at the TCP layer to meet the necessity for a practical and truly end-to-end security solution. We call our framework TCPsec. TCPsec is a security extension to TCP and implemented in the kernel. Applications may use TCPsec through regular TCP <b>sockets</b> by <b>setting</b> special <b>socket</b> options. TCPsec uses a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) -like handshake {{to set up a}} secure session. It is interoperable with Network Address Translators. We implement TCPsec in the FreeBSD 4. 7 kernel and evaluate its performance. Our implementation and evaluation show that TCPsec incurs only a modest overhead as compared to TCP and performs competitively with SSL.

40|$|The {{electronic}} commerce (e-commerce) in Internet arose {{at the end}} of the 90 s as a transforming element of the society in the 21 st century. Even though the evolution of the {{electronic commerce}} has been important, it has not reached the initial expectations. The lack of tools to support the users' confidence about the new model of commerce through computer networks has been an important problem for its growth. Fortunately, the appearance of technologies and electronic payment systems offer users security and integrity guarantees to carry out electronic transactions. Nevertheless, the lack of confidence keeps being the main barrier (not technical but psychological) to achieve the success of the e-commerce. In this paper, we review the three main secure payment protocols in e-commerce, SSL (Secure <b>Sockets</b> Layer), <b>SET</b> (Secure Electronic Transaction) and 3 D Secure, with the aim of removing any doubt about the lack of security in the electronic commercial transactions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of tests in which high strength fasteners, <b>socket</b> head <b>set</b> screws (SHCS), were tightened to yield as a means of generating maximum clamping force. The tightening tests were performed {{with the aid of a}} microprocessor controlled torque wrench and a torque-tension testing rig. Load cells fitted to the test rig provided an accurate measurement of the joint clamp load and the faster thread and underhead torque distribution under a range of lubrication conditions. Measurements were made during tightening to yield, under static load condition after yield tightening, and during loosening. The results obtained established that the lubrication conditions dramatically affect the magnitude of the maximum clamp load achieved on the joint and the torque distribution on the fastener. The results also enabled an estimate to be made of the coefficient of friction on the various mating surfaces during the tightening and loosening of the fastener. It was shown that the design of bolted joints must take account of the influence of friction if thejoints are to operate effectively in service. ...|$|R
5000|$|Concerning the {{dissemination}} of the screws and wrenches, Hallowell said that [...] "the transition from a square head set screw refers here to the then-ubiquitous external-wrenching square drive to a hexagon <b>socket</b> head hollow <b>set</b> screw, for {{which had to be}} developed special keys or wrenches for tightening or loosening the screw, was the cause of more profanity among the mechanics and machine manufacturers than any other single event that happened. … I am sure that the old-timers who read this book will remember this period vividly."

40|$|Abstract—Most {{of studies}} about E-Commerce Security {{focus on the}} data {{confidentiality}} issue. Although security mechanisms, such as SSL (secure <b>socket</b> layer) or <b>SET</b> (secure electronic transaction), have been adopted in websites, catastrophic events that confidential data in E-Commerce are revealed happened more than once. The essential {{reason for this is}} that there exist potential security vulnerabilities in the E-Commerce applications themselves. The origins of these vulnerabilities are mainly from the lack of reliable input validation that can prevent E-commerce application from attacks. SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and Price Changing Attack are mainly known security threats to E-Commerce applications. These attacks and the protecting ways by using XML validation technology have been discussed, and a framework that prevents E-Commerce applications from attacks has been proposed in this paper...|$|R
