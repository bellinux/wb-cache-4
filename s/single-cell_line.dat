40|$|An early drug {{discovery}} approach focusing on gene families {{can benefit from}} strategies that exploit common signaling mech-anisms to more effectively identify and characterize novel chemical lead structures. Multiplexing, defined as the screening of multiple targets within the same experiment, {{is an example of}} this strategy. Here, the authors describe a technique that allows multiplexing of a common assay type used to study G-protein–coupled receptors: changes in intracellular Ca 2 + levels as mea-sured by Molecular Device’s fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR®). The multiplexed FLIPR assays showed the ex-pected pharmacological properties of single assays, with good reproducibility and Z ′ factors. The authors used them to screen large compound libraries in 2 multiplexed assay designs. The 1 st used a <b>single-cell</b> <b>line</b> expressing 2 different receptors and the 2 nd a mixture of 2 cell lines of the same type each expressing distinct receptors. Screening using these multiplexed assays produced significant savings in reagents, time, and human resources and allowed the authors to quickly identify specific and selective hits.

40|$|Symptomatic {{intraspinal}} extradural meningeal cysts are rare. We {{present the}} case of a 17 -year-old female with low back pain, progressive numbness, and radiation pain to the flank and lower limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic myelography revealed a huge intraspinal extradural meningeal cyst extending from T 12 to L 3 with cord and dural sac compression. The patient underwent surgery to open the cyst and close the connecting dural defect. Pathologic examination of the cyst disclosed non-specific fibrous connective tissue without an inner arachnoid <b>single-cell</b> <b>lining.</b> She achieved complete recovery after the operation. There was no recurrence of the cyst at a 2 -year follow-up...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, it has become evident that the {{endothelium}} is not merely an inert, <b>single-cell</b> <b>lining</b> that covers the internal surface of blood vessels, but in fact {{plays a crucial role}} in regulating vascular function. Although serving as an extremely active endocrine and paracrine organ that produces a large variety of molecules participating in complex biochemical processes, the simple product generated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) - nitric oxide (NO) - seems to be the key molecule required for the maintenance of vascular homeostasis (1 - 4). For example, NO produced by eNOS causes vasodilation. Thus, eNOS knockout mice are hypertensive (5), whereas eNOS transgenic mice exhibit hypotension (6). In addition, NO reduces the activation and aggregation of platelets, attenuates adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium, reduces the permeability of the endothelium, and inhibits proliferation and migration of vascula...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, it has become evident that the {{endothelium}} {{is more than an}} inert, <b>single-cell</b> <b>lining</b> covering the internal surface of blood vessels. Normally, the endothelium actively decreases vascular tone, maintains vascular permeability within narrow bounds, inhibits platelet adhesion and aggregation, limits activation of the coagulation system, and stimulates fibrinolysis. Endothelium dysfunction can be considered present when its functions, either in the basal state or after stimulation, are altered {{in a way that is}} inappropriate to the preservation of organ function. Endothelial dysfunction has been associated to many cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. In addition, endothelial dysfunction may play a crucial role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. This review will give a brief overview of the different methods to assess endothelial function, and then will focus on the current knowledge on soluble cellular adhesion molecules in relation to the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabete...|$|R
5|$|There {{are four}} main types of thunderstorms: <b>single-cell,</b> {{multi-cell}}, squall <b>line</b> (also called multi-cell line) and supercell.

Single-cell thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20–30 minutes.|$|R

Single-cell thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20-30 minutes. Organized thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters/lines can have longer life cycles as they form in environments of significant vertical wind shear, which aids the development of stronger updrafts as well as various forms of severe weather. The supercell is the strongest of the thunderstorms, most commonly associated with large hail, high winds, and tornado formation.|$|R

40|$|Nonspecific {{cytotoxic}} cells (NCC) in teleost {{fish are}} analogous to human natural killer (NK) cells and spontaneously lyse {{a variety of}} transformed human cell lines sensitive to human NK cell lysis. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) made against these NK-like effector cells inhibited their lytic activity. These anti-NCC mAbs were examined with human NK cells for their effects. It was observed that these mAbs bound specifically to {{a small percentage of}} peripheral blood lymphocytes (5 - 15 %) and to the majority (greater than 85 %) of CD 3 - NK cells. The mAbs inhibited human NK cell lysis against a variety of transformed cell <b>lines.</b> <b>Single-cell</b> assays showed that the mAbs exerted their effects through inhibition of conjugate formation (recognition). However, the mAbs did not inhibit NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Biochemical analysis of the NK cell molecule revealed that a dimeric structure was involved (distinct from antigen receptors on T cells). Thus, this molecule appears to be a candidate NK cell antigen receptor...|$|R
