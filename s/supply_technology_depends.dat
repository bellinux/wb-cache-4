40|$|The future {{evolution}} of energy <b>supply</b> <b>technologies</b> strongly <b>depends</b> on (and affects) {{the economic and}} environmental systems, due to the high dependency of this sector on the availability and cost of fossil fuels, especially on the small regional scale. This paper aims at presenting the modeling system and preliminary results of a research project conducted {{on the scale of}} Luxembourg to assess the environmental impact of future energy scenarios for the country, integrating outputs from partial and computable general equilibrium models within hybrid Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) frameworks. The general equilibrium model for Luxembourg, LUXGEM, is used to evaluate the economic impacts of policy decisions and other economic shocks over the time horizon 2006 - 2030. A techno-economic (partial equilibrium) model for Luxembourg, ETEM, is used instead to compute operation levels of various technologies to meet the demand for energy services at the least cost along the same timeline. The future energy demand and supply are made consistent by coupling ETEM with LUXGEM so as to have the same macro-economic variables and energy shares driving both models. The coupling results are then implemented within a set of Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (EE-IO) models in historical time series to test the feasibility of the integrated framework and then to assess the environmental impacts of the country. Accordingly, a disaggregated energy sector was built with the different ETEM technologies in the EE-IO to allow hybridization with Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) and enrich the process detail. The results show that the environmental impact slightly decreased overall from 2006 to 2009. Most of the impacts come from some imported commodities (natural gas, used to produce electricity, and metalliferous ores and metal scrap). The main energy production technology is the combined-cycle gas turbine plant 9 ̆ 3 Twinerg 9 ̆ 4, representing almost 80...|$|R

40|$|Understanding and {{supporting}} learning for different emerging low carbon energy <b>supply</b> <b>technology</b> fields {{is a key}} issue for policymakers, investors and researchers. A range of contrasting analytical approaches are available: energy system modelling using learning rates provides abstracted, quantitative and output oriented accounts, while innovation studies research offers contextualised, qualitative and process oriented accounts. Drawing on research literature and expert consultation on learning for several different emerging energy <b>supply</b> <b>technologies,</b> this paper introduces a ‘learning pathways’ matrix to help bridge between the rich contextualisation of innovation studies and the systematic comparability of learning rates. The learning pathways matrix characterises technology fields by their relative orientation to radical or incremental innovation, and to concentrated or distributed organisation. A number of archetypal learning pathways are outlined to help learning rates analyses draw on innovation studies research, so as to better acknowledge the different niche origins and learning dynamics of emerging energy <b>supply</b> <b>technologies.</b> Finally, a future research agenda is outlined, based on socio-technical learning scenarios for accelerated energy innovation...|$|R
40|$|Transitioning {{towards a}} {{sustainable}} energy system requires the large-scale introduction of novel energy demand and <b>supply</b> <b>technologies.</b> Such novel technologies are often expensive {{at the point of}} their market introduction but eventually become cheaper due to technological learning. In order to quantify potentials for price and cost decline, the experience curve approach has been extensively applied to renewable and non-renewable energy <b>supply</b> <b>technologies.</b> However, its application to energy demand technologies is far less frequent. Here, we provide the first comprehensive review of experience curve analyses for energy demand technologies. We find a widespread trend towards declining prices and costs at an average learning rate of 18 ± 9 %. This finding is consistent with the results for energy <b>supply</b> <b>technologies</b> and for manufacturing in general. Learning rates for individual energy demand technologies are symmetrically distributed around the arithmetic mean of the data sample. Absolute variation of learning rates within individual technology clusters of 7 ± 4 %-points and between technology clusters of 7 ± 5 %-points both contribute to the overall variability of learning rates. Our results show that technological learning is as important for energy demand technologies as it is for energy <b>supply</b> <b>technologies.</b> Applying the experience curve approach to forecast technology costs involves, however, unresolved uncertainties, as we demonstrate in a case study for the micro-cogeneration technology...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{and development of}} Information Technology (IT) have moved forward the concept of supply chain to a recognized strategic component with effective, {{positive impact on the}} firm’s business. There are very few studies related to the antecedents of <b>supply</b> chain <b>technology</b> adoption on local context. Therefore, the <b>supply</b> chain <b>technology</b> can be adopted by the large companies as well as small and medium enterprises due to advance of technology. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the antecedents of <b>supply</b> chain <b>technology</b> adoption among the SMEs in Johor Bahru using the combination of <b>supply</b> chain <b>technology</b> adoption framework by Patterson et al. (2003) and Russell and Hoag, (2004). The framework model determined three antecedents which were environmental factors, organizational factors and communicational factors. Data and information were gathered from 103 respondents through the personal administrated questionnaires for 6 months. Data was analyzed by descriptive analysis, reliability analysis, Pearson Correlation analysis and Multiple Regression analysis via the software Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). The results show that were significant and positive correlation between the antecedents of <b>supply</b> chain <b>technology</b> adoption and <b>supply</b> chain <b>technology</b> adoption. The regression analysis shows that out of three antecedents, only the organizational factors have a negative impact to the <b>supply</b> chain <b>technology</b> adoption while the communicational and environmental factors have a positive impact towards the <b>supply</b> chain <b>technology</b> adoption. It is recommended that future study to determine additional antecedents of <b>supply</b> chain <b>technology</b> that pertinent with the current SMEs industry.
