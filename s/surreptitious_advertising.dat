40|$|This chapter {{investigates the}} legal and ethical {{framework}} for content marketing. The use of content marketing necessitates special considerations due to its legal implications for the marketer. In addition, legal rules should be interpreted in accordance with ethical standards for advertising and marketing communication practice. The general provision that all marketing should be designed and presented {{in such a way}} that its marketing purpose is clear, serves as a starting point for this legal analysis. As <b>surreptitious</b> <b>advertising</b> is prohibited, the marketer must identify advertising as such. Furthermore, principal rules on marketing practice also apply to content marketing. Thus, legal and ethical analyses include discussions regarding good marketing practice, misleading and unfair advertising, special concerns regarding content marketing directed toward children, evidential rules and law enforcemen...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays in the {{business}} and corporate world we can increasingly often hear the expression Corporate Social Responsibility. In the democratic countries of the world the CSR communication develops fast and {{it is one of the}} essential elements of economic philosophy. In Hungary the CSR communication is in a hard situation because in the Hungarian media, the distinction between <b>surreptitious</b> <b>advertising</b> and CSR is not yet defined by law and regulated. In previous conference studies I dealt with the CSR communication of Hungarian large banks among which the OTP Bank has the best experience. The aim of my study is to examine the communication of CSR activities through the example of a Hungarian large bank, namely OTP Bank and to explore its potential. In my study firstly I describe the definition of CSR and its communication this is how the corporate social responsibility can be interpreted. Then I demonstrate the CSR communication tools. In the main part of my writing I examine the possibilities of CSR presence and analyze the application of CSR communication tools in the case of a Hungarian large bank. I close my study formulation of hypotheses for national bank sector and further research proposals. My main research questions are: 1. How CSR initiatives are being communicated? 2. How to get publicity for the CSR actions? 3. How to improve the CSR communication?corporate social responsibility, CSR communication, bank...|$|E
40|$|Children are {{particularly}} interesting {{to the media}} and advertising, since they are more receptive to advertisement than adults during adolescence. The problem of advertising is mainly unhealthy food, but for child’s healthy growth and development a balanced diet and physical activity are most needed. The objectives of the thesis were to explore children's magazines and to determine the frequency of food advertising, and to present the phenomenon of food advertisements through different periods of time. We determined whether the children's magazines advertise less-recommended food and food with a higher content of simple sugars and fats that consumed in excessive quantities adversely affect the healthy growth and development of the child. In this study, we analyzed the advertisements of four children's magazines, in the two ten-year periods. Research has shown that food advertising in children's magazines over the years increased advertising with mostly less preferred foods with lots of sugar, fat and salt. The advertisements are full page and often include a prize game or a comic. The advertisements also often include appealing characters which quickly attract children's attention. Advertisements are often a part of <b>surreptitious</b> <b>advertising.</b> According to children’s health problems, which are often associated with inadequate diet, it would be necessary to prohibit advertising foods with a higher content of sugar, fat and salt to children. Editors and advertisers should more strictly observe the laws, regulations and recommendations which deal with advertising, but it also needs more consistent control over legislators advertising to children...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 With the {{explosion}} of online shopping sites, {{there has been a}} proliferation of businesses offering to post positive product reviews in exchange for payment. The presence of these deceptive reviews transforms a product's online reviews from a source of candid customer feedback into a forum for <b>surreptitious</b> <b>advertising.</b> Given this trend, there is a demand for effective methods of detecting fake reviews and/or products for which reviews have been purchased. These tools could enable companies to identify and crack down on reviewers and vendors engaging in these deceptive practices. In this work, we present new statistical methods for the detection of deceptive product reviews, focusing specifically on the detection of products for which a high percentage of the positive reviews are fake. Using a new hand-built corpus of online product reviews, we show that there is a correlation between textual features of a product's 5 -star reviews and product metadata features that have been demonstrated to suggest the presence of deceptive product reviews, such as star rating distribution. Drawing from the literature on advertising language, the literature on deception, and a series of human performance experiments, we then propose a model that makes use of discourse structure to classify individual reviews as suspicious or trustworthy. While there have been numerous studies in fake review detection, there has been relatively little work in identifying deception on the product level. Our work is also novel in that it draws connections between fake review detection and advertising, a domain in which there has been little computational linguistics research. Furthermore, our work contrasts with much of the previous work in fake review detection in that we explore methods for developing a gold standard in a corpus of voluntarily posted product reviews, as opposed to soliciting deceptive reviews for the purpose of our research...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} manner in which France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK have implemented the provisions in 1989 Television Without Frontiers Directive for television advertising and sponsorship shows that there are obstacles {{for the development of a}} Single European Market in television advertising. Although 1989 Television Without Frontiers Directive allowed transfrontier television advertising, the regulation of television advertising remains nationally based. Furthen-nore, Member States have different levels of advertising expenditure, selling practices and television market structures. There is a tension between the provisions for television advertising and sponsorship in the Council of Europe Convention on Transfrontier Television and those in the Television Without Frontiers Directive. Member States have indicated their commitment to one text over the other in the detailed choices for their national rules. The European Court of Justice resolved some of the contradictions and ambiguities in the 1989 Television Without Frontiers Directive, and these have been reflected in the revised 1997 text. But there is still an ambiguity so as to what level of sponsor presence is adequate to ensure both transparency, and the protection of a broadcaster's editorial independence. Rules about the frequency and quantity of advertising differ between the five countries and four of them set different competitive requirements according to the type of broadcaster. There are marked differences in the rules about advertising breaks in feature films and other audiovisual works. National rules on sponsorship also vary, especially those on centre credits and the promotional mentions of the sponsor within the programme. So do the detailed provisions. National regulators decide when and what type of commercial presence constitutes <b>surreptitious</b> <b>advertising.</b> In some countries, it is only payment that renders product placement illegal, whereas in others the product has to be editorially justified and not given undue prominence. Direct offers to the public have proved to be a grey area in Member States where their economic value was high. Teleshopping is likely to become a significant source of programming, especially if Member States effectively expand their limits on airtime as allowed in the 1997 text. Although some differences have been resolved in the 1997 revision of the Television Without Frontiers Directive, there are still difficulties in establishing an effective level playing field for European television advertising...|$|E
