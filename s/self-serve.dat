40|$|The {{literature}} on whether varying plate size {{has an effect}} on consumption is mixed and contradictory. This meta-analysis of 56 studies from 20 papers shows that varying the size of the container holding food (e. g., plate orbowl) has a substantial effect on amount <b>self-served</b> and/or consumed (Cohen’s d 5. 43). More generally, we found adoubling of plate size increased the amount <b>self-served</b> or amount consumed by 41 %. Our analysis resolves the variouscontradictions of past reviews: we found that the plate-size effect had a substantial effect on amount <b>self-served</b> (d 5. 51) and on amount consumed when the portion was <b>self-served</b> (d 5. 70) or manipulated along with (confoundedwith) plate size (d 5 48). However, plate size had no effect on amount consumed when the portion size was held constant(d 5. 03).

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{an extension}} of the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) in which only a part of the available request portfolio can be fulfilled by own equipment and the remaining requests are served by subcontracted carriers (Logistic Service Providers). The costs for the fulfillment of the request portfolio result in the sum of travel costs for the <b>self-served</b> requests and the charges paid to the Logistic Service Providers. A Memetic Algorithm (MA) is configured to determine solutions of this combined selection, assignment and sequencing problem. Special genetic operators are proposed to identify those requests that should be served by Logistics Service Providers in order to minimize the overall fulfillment costs. By means of suitable benchmark instances, the capability of the algorithmic approach is assessed and the impacts of the selection feature are analyzed. ...|$|R

This was controversial because {{in the previous year}} Circuit City was the number two appliance retailer in the United States, behind only Sears. The company had earned nearly US$1.6 billion in sales revenue from large appliances in 1999. However, executives were concerned about the competition from Home Depot and Lowe's and believed there would be big savings in warehouse storage and delivery costs if they quit the large appliance business.

40|$|Objective: With an {{increasing}} dinner plate and portion sizes, {{a better understanding}} of self-serving food behaviors is needed to help individuals develop and maintain healthy eating habits. The goal of this project is to educate students on the Delboeuf Illusion to increase self-efficacy and minimize over-serving food to oneself. Method: This project examines four aspects of self-serving behaviors of college students by using pre- and post-test measurements. An understanding of the difference between a serving and a portion, and daily-recommended servings, is evaluated. Knowledge of food serving equivalencies to common, everyday objects is reviewed. The influence of the Delboeuf Illusion is measured. Confidence of dishing up an appropriate serving of food to oneself is also measured. Results: Anticipated findings will include significant increases of knowledge of food serving equivalencies and the Delboeuf Illusion, and modest increases in food groups and servings. Conclusion: Providing education on the influence of visual illusions and common-object equivalencies for appropriate serving sizes will help increase self-efficacy regarding <b>self-served</b> foods...|$|R
