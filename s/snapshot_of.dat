5|$|In October 2015, Kashyap {{teamed up}} with Ridley Scott and Richie Mehta for Google, as the {{executive}} producer for the documentary India in a Day. The project was for people across India to film a <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> their day and upload it on Google's official website.|$|E
5|$|The gaps are {{not seen}} in a simple <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> the {{locations}} of the asteroids at any one time because asteroid orbits are elliptical, and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps. The actual spatial density of asteroids in these gaps does not differ significantly from the neighboring regions.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{specialized}} and rare circumstances {{required for a}} biological structure to fossilize, logic dictates that known fossils represent {{only a small percentage}} of all life-forms that ever existed—and that each discovery represents only a <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which never demonstrate an exact half-way point between clearly divergent forms.|$|E

It also includes results of the Labour Party National Executive Committee elections, European Parliamentary elections from 1994 onwards, a list of members expelled since the 1660 Restoration, and recent regional elections for the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Greater London Authority.

5|$|DragonFly BSD {{supports}} Amiga-style resident applications feature: {{it takes}} a <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> a large, dynamically linked program's virtual memory space after loading, allowing future instances of the program to start {{much more quickly than}} it otherwise would have. This replaces the prelinking capability that was being worked on earlier in the project's history, as the resident support is much more efficient. Large programs like those found in KDE Software Compilation with many shared libraries will benefit the most from this support.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} {{of this system}} with the rigid meter, and the stress patterns this implies, provides enough information to reconstruct his pronunciation with some precision; making the reasonable assumption that Orm's pronunciation {{was in no way}} unusual, this permits scholars of history of English to develop an exceptionally precise <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> exactly how Middle English was pronounced in the Midlands {{in the second half of}} the twelfth century (Matthew 2004, p.936).|$|E

5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses {{the whole history}} of a universe— it is not just some <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{scientific}} paintings adopted {{elements from}} {{the tradition of}} history painting but lacked the heroic central action typical of that genre. While ground-breaking, they are regarded as peculiar to Wright, whose unique style has been explained in many ways. Wright's provincial status and ties to the Lunar Society, a group of prominent industrialists, scientists and intellectuals who met regularly in Birmingham between 1765 and 1813, have been highlighted, {{as well as his}} close association with and sympathy for the advances made in the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. Other critics have emphasised a desire to capture a <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> the society of the day, in the tradition of William Hogarth but with a more neutral stance that lacks the biting satire of Hogarth's work.|$|E
