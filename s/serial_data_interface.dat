40|$|Asynchronous <b>serial</b> <b>data</b> <b>interfaces</b> {{require the}} {{receiver}} to recover the data by examining the bitstream and determining where each bit should be sampled {{in the absence of}} a clock sent with the data. There are several ways to implement this type of receiver in Xilinx FPGAs. RocketIO ™ transceivers are designed specifically for this task but are not available in all Xilinx FPGAs. Depending on the device family and speed grade, SelectIO ™ inputs and FPGA logic resources can implement asynchronous serial receivers at bit rates up to nearly 1 Gb/s. For data with short run lengths and low jitter, sampling the bitstream about four times per bit period can be sufficient. Such a low oversampling rate data recovery technique is described in XAPP 224, Data Recovery. However, when the data has long run lengths without bit transitions or high jitter tolerance is required, higher oversampling rates are required, traditionally requiring the use of multiple clock phases that often consumes several digital clock managers (DCMs) and many global clock resources. Xilinx Virtex™- 4 and Virtex- 5 devices a have high-precision programmable delay element associated with every input pin. These delay elements, called IDELAY, can be used to implement an oversampler that uses very few FPGA logic resources and, more importantly, just a single DCM and two global clock resources to do 8 X oversampling. This solution provides better jitter tolerance than techniques that use multiple DCMs. When paired with a suitable data recovery scheme, the oversampling technique described here can be used with many different data protocols up to 550 Mb/s in Virtex- 5 devices and 500 Mb/s in Virtex- 4 devices.

30|$|The maximum {{bit rate}} of the {{proposed}} system is limited either by the RF modules or implemented hardware logic blocks. Indeed, the hardware FPGA implementations allow parallel/serial and serial/parallel converters with {{minimum and maximum rates}} of 25.36 and 36.27 Mbps obtained with Virtex II and Virtex V technologies, respectively (see Table  1). However, for the considered Zigbee protocol, the maximum bit {{rate of the}} proposed system is limited by the RF modules. The hardware FPGA implementation performance (for working clock frequency, see Table  1) of the proposed system (at the transmitter and receiver) is considered, and it is larger than the <b>serial</b> <b>interface</b> <b>data</b> rate and better than the bit rate, which is allowed by the considered Zigbee RF modules. Consequently, the limitation is imposed by the transmission rate of the parallel/serial and serial/parallel converters toward Zigbee Xbee RF modules while FPGA implementations allow to provide transmission rates to at least 25 Mbps. Thereby, for a null distance frame value (N[*]=[*] 0), the obtained data bit rate of the serial communication is 250 kbps (corresponding to a modulation rate of 625 symbols per second or baud, due to the maximum <b>serial</b> <b>interface</b> <b>data</b> rate of the Zigbee protocol based XBee Pro modules [33], and with an operating frequency modulation of 2.4 GHz. In the case of the Wi-Fi protocol, the maximum bit rate of the proposed system is limited by the work frequency of the implemented hardware modules. Although the FPGA implementation of the Lorenz generator allows to provide a throughput of 80 Mbps (maximal frequency of 25 MHz is allowed by the considered Virtex II platform with an encoded 32 -bit encrypted data), the maximum transmission bit rate of the proposed system is limited by the hyperchaotic key generators up to 25 Mbps (for N[*]=[*] 0) and by a corresponding modulation rate of 625, 000 baud. Therefore, the parallel/serial and serial/parallel converters to Wi-Fi Xbee RF modules limit the transmission rate up to the maximum work frequency, depending on the considered FPGA technology. Indeed, each symbol of the data transmission system carries 40 bits according to the data frame wordlength allowed by the serial interface Xbee modules. This digital modulation rate operates with a frequency modulation range between 2.4 and 2.5 GHz [26]. In summary, considering a synchronous system at the maximum work frequency allowed between the key stream generators and parallel/serial or serial/parallel converters, the limitations with respect to 54 -Mbps and 25 -kbps bit rates of the Wi-Fi and Zigbee RF modules are due to the work frequencies of hyperchaotic Lorenz generators and the <b>serial</b> <b>interface</b> <b>data</b> rate, respectively.|$|R

40|$|A multiplexer/demultiplexer {{system has}} been {{developed}} to enable the transmission, over a single channel, of four data streams generated {{by a variety of}} sources at different (including variable) bit rates. In the original intended application, replicas of this multiplexer/demultiplexer system would be incorporated into the spacecraft-to-ground communication systems of the space shuttles. The multiplexer of each system would be installed in the spacecraft, where it would acquire and process data from such sources as commercial digital camcorders, video tape recorders, and the spacecraft telemetry system. The demultiplexer of each system would be installed in a ground station. Purely terrestrial systems of similar design could be attractive for use in situations in which there are requirements to transmit multiple streams of high-quality video data and possibly other data over single channels. The figure is a block diagram of the multiplexer as configured to process data received via three fiber-optic channels like those of the International Space Station and one electrical-cable channel that conforms to the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 1394 standard. (This standard consists of specifications of a high-speed <b>serial</b> <b>data</b> <b>interface,</b> the physical layer of which includes a cable known in the art as "FireWire. " An IEEE 1394 interface can also transfer power between the components to which it is connected.) The fiber-optic channels carry packet and/or bit-stream signals that conform to the standards of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS). The IEEE 1394 interface accepts an isochronous signal like that from a digital camcorder or a video tape recorder. The processing of the four input data streams to combine them into one output stream is governed by a statistical multiplexing algorithm that features a flow-control capability and makes it possible to utilize the transmission channel with nearly 100 -percent efficiency. This algorithm allocates the available bandwidth of the transmission channel to the data streams according to a combination of data rates and preassigned priorities. Incoming data streams that demand too much bandwidth are blocked. Bandwidth not needed for a transmission of a given data stream is allocated to other streams as available. Priority is given to the IEEE 1394 stream. In addition to the four incoming data streams, the multiplexer transmits data on the status of the system. An operator can monitor and control the multiplexer via displays and controls on the multiplexer housing. The output of the multiplexer is connected via a coaxial cable with an impedance of 50 Ohms to an interface circuit compatible with the space-shuttle high-speed digital downlink, which operates at a rate of 48 Mb/s...|$|E
