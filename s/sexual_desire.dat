5|$|The {{ninth and}} tenth commandments deal with coveting, {{which is an}} {{interior}} disposition not a physical act.

5|$|Thelema is a {{rarely used}} in {{classical}} Greek. There {{are very few}} documents, the earliest being Antiphon the Sophist (5th century BCE).

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} the current {{study was to examine the}} {{characteristics}} of those who report fulfilment of <b>sexual</b> <b>desires</b> as a result of internet use for sexual purposes and which sexually related online activities contribute to the fulfilment of <b>sexual</b> <b>desires.</b> Methods: Data were collected through a questionnaire posted on Swedish language websites in 2009. The sample comprised 1614 respondents who reported using the internet for sexual purposes, 62 % women and 38 % men. Results: The results showed that the majority of the respondents had their <b>sexual</b> <b>desires</b> fulfilled as a result of their sexually related activities on the internet; 21 % to a great extent and 59 % to a small extent, but 20 % did not have their <b>sexual</b> <b>desires</b> fulfilled. Using a multinomial logistic regression analysis, respondents who had their <b>sexual</b> <b>desires</b> fulfilled to a small or great extent were each compared with those who did not have their <b>sexual</b> <b>desires</b> fulfilled at all. At the level of individual characteristics and sexual behaviours, those with no fulfilment of their <b>sexual</b> <b>desires</b> did not differ from those who had their <b>sexual</b> <b>desires</b> fulfilled, with the exceptions of age and masturbation. In comparison to fulfilment to a small extent, fulfilment of <b>sexual</b> <b>desires</b> to a great extent was predicted by a larger number of sexually related online activities that were based on interaction. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the internet may contribute to fulfilment of <b>sexual</b> <b>desires</b> among a large internet population, irrespective of sex or sexual identity...|$|R

5|$|Persistent genital arousal {{disorder}} (PGAD) {{results in}} a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable genital arousal in women, with or without orgasm, unrelated to any feelings of <b>sexual</b> <b>desire.</b> Clitoral priapism, also known as clitorism, is a rare, potentially painful medical condition and is sometimes described as an aspect of PGAD, in which the erect clitoris does not return to its relaxed state for an unusually {{extended period of time}} (ranging from minutes to days), despite the absence of both physical and psychological stimulation; PGAD can also be associated with morphometric and vascular modifications of the clitoris.|$|E

5|$|Baron Hector Hulot is {{a living}} manifestation of male <b>sexual</b> <b>desire,</b> {{unrestrained}} and unconcerned with its consequences for the man or his family.

5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} few {{antidepressants}} {{that does}} not cause sexual dysfunction. A range of studies demonstrate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants, but can actually help to alleviate sexual dysfunction. According to a survey of psychiatrists, it is the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, although this is not an indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. There have also been a few studies suggesting that bupropion can improve sexual function in women who are not depressed, if they have hypoactive <b>sexual</b> <b>desire</b> disorder (HSDD).|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the 1920s was {{a decade}} of social experimentation, {{particularly}} with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud, who theorized that <b>sexual</b> <b>desire</b> would be sated unconsciously, despite an individual's wish to ignore it. Freud's theories were much more pervasive in the U.S. than in Europe. With the well-publicized notion that sexual acts {{were a part of}} lesbianism and their relationships, sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.|$|E

5|$|Ophelia {{has also}} been defended by feminist critics, most notably Elaine Showalter. Ophelia is {{surrounded}} by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia is driven into madness. Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her <b>sexual</b> <b>desire</b> to have Hamlet kill her father {{so they can be}} together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture.|$|E
5|$|Tertiary sexual {{dysfunction}} results from {{psychological and social}} factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal {{could be due to}} psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced <b>sexual</b> <b>desire</b> after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties. Drug and alcohol abuse increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.|$|E

However, the study found that the existing evidence is not very good.

A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that circumcision did not affect premature ejaculation.|$|E
40|$|Are sexual {{orientation}}s freely chosen? The {{idea that}} someone’s sexual orientation {{is not a}} choice is very influential in the mainstream LGBT political movement. But do we have good reasons to believe {{it is not a}} choice? Going against the orthodoxy, William Wilkerson has recently argued that sexual orientation is partly constituted by our interpretations of our own <b>sexual</b> <b>desires,</b> and we choose these interpretations, so sexual orientation is partly constituted by choice. In this paper I aim to examine the question of whether our interpretations of our own <b>sexual</b> <b>desires</b> are constitutive of our sexual orientations. I will argue that whereas Wilkerson’s argument for the claim that sexual orientations are in part constituted by our chosen interpretations of our <b>sexual</b> <b>desires</b> is not sound, there are good reasons for endorsing a weaker claim, namely, that there are different but equally apt descriptions of the same <b>sexual</b> <b>desires,</b> depending on which concepts we have...|$|R

5|$|The novel's {{characters}} represent polarities of contrasting morality. The vengeful Bette and disingenuous Valérie {{stand on}} one side, with the merciful Adeline and her patient daughter Hortense on the other. The {{patriarch of the}} Hulot family, meanwhile, is consumed by his own <b>sexual</b> <b>desire.</b> Hortense's husband, the Polish exile Wenceslas Steinbock, represents artistic genius, though he succumbs to uncertainty and lack of motivation. Balzac based the character of Bette in part on his mother and the poet Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. At least one scene involving Baron Hulot was likely based on an event {{in the life of}} Balzac's friend, the novelist Victor Hugo.|$|E
5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections are {{connected}} to Coleridge's The Eolian Harp as the scene for both is the same. The land of Clevedon is praised and seen full of life, and it serves as contrast to escaping {{from the real world}} into fantasy and pondering about the abstract. Both poems also describe Coleridge's relationship with his wife and feelings of <b>sexual</b> <b>desire.</b> The imagination aspects of the poem represent an unwillingness to accept nature on its own and rejects the conclusion of The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God, one cannot just simply exist in such an area but must seek out truth.|$|E
5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections {{are similar to}} those of The Eolian Harp. They are set in the same location, and both {{describe}} Coleridge's relationship with his wife and <b>sexual</b> <b>desire.</b> The reflection on his life within the poem represent an unwillingness to accept his current idyllic life and a rejection of the conclusion drawn in The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God in Coleridge's view, he reflects on how one cannot simply exist in such an area but must actively seek out truth in order to fulfill God's will. The poem details how men feel a need to seek truth like a philosopher while also desiring to simply live in an idyllic natural state. The poem reconciles these desires by claiming that the pursuer of truth can still reflect back on his time when he was simply enjoying nature and God's presence.|$|E

5|$|Traditional Western {{beliefs about}} the spotted hyena {{can be traced back}} to Aristotle's Historia Animalium, which {{described}} the species as a necrophagous, cowardly and potentially dangerous animal. He further described how the hyena uses retching noises to attract dogs. In On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle criticised the erroneous belief that the spotted hyena is a hermaphrodite (which likely originated from the confusion caused by the masculinised genitalia of the female), though his physical descriptions are more consistent with the striped hyena. Pliny the Elder supported Aristotle's depiction, though he further elaborated that the hyena can imitate human voices. Additionally, he wrote how the hyena was held in high regard among the Magi, and that hyena body parts could cure different diseases, give protection and stimulate <b>sexual</b> <b>desire</b> in people.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong <b>sexual</b> <b>desire</b> but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E
5|$|Women in {{homosexual}} relationships {{responded to}} this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in Europe and the United States. Following World War II, {{during a period of}} social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other. Greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families. With second wave feminism and growth of scholarship in women's history and sexuality in the 20th century, the definition of lesbian broadened, sparking a debate about <b>sexual</b> <b>desire</b> as the major component to define what a lesbian is. Some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well, while other women's self-identification as lesbian may not align with their sexual orientation or sexual behavior; sexual identity is not necessarily the same as one's sexual orientation or sexual behavior, due to various reasons, such as the fear of identifying their sexual orientation in a homophobic setting.|$|E

40|$|Is there {{a choice}} in sexual orientation? [Wilkerson, William S. (2009) : “Is It a Choice? Sexual Orientation as Interpretation”. In: Journal of Social Philosophy 40. No. 1, p. 97 – 116] argues that <b>sexual</b> <b>desires</b> require {{interpretation}} {{in order to be}} fully constituted, and therefore sexual orientation is at least partially constituted by choice. [Díaz-León, Esa (2017) : “Sexual Orientation as Interpretation? <b>Sexual</b> <b>Desires,</b> Concepts, and Choice”; In: Journal of Social Ontology] critically assesses Wilkerson’s argument, concluding that we still lack a good argument for the claim that choice plays a role in sexual orientation. Here I examine Díaz-León’s response to Wilkerson. I introduce what I call the conceptual act theory of sexual orientation, and argue that even if interpretation were not necessary to constitute <b>sexual</b> <b>desires,</b> it is a necessary element to constitute what we call sexual orientation. However, I conclude that even if we agree that interpretation is involved in sexual orientation, it does not follow that there is {{a choice in}}volved...|$|R
