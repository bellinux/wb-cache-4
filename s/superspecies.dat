5|$|The {{nuthatch}}es are {{a family}} of similar-looking birds with short tails and wings, compact bodies and longish pointed bills. They have grey or bluish upperparts, a black eyestripe and strong feet. All are in the single genus Sitta. Within the genus, the Eurasian nuthatch forms a <b>superspecies</b> with the chestnut-vented, Indian, chestnut-bellied and Kashmir nuthatches and {{has in the past}} been considered conspecific with all of these.|$|E
5|$|Johann Georg Wagler {{gave the}} species its current {{binomial}} name in 1832 when he erected the new genus Eudocimus, whose only other species is the scarlet ibis (E.ruber). There {{has long been}} debate on whether the two should be considered subspecies or closely related species, and the American Ornithologists' Union considers the two to be a <b>superspecies</b> as they are parapatric. The lack of observed hybrids was a large factor in {{the view that the}} species were separate.|$|E
5|$|The nightjars, Caprimulgidae, are a {{large family}} of mostly nocturnal insect-eating birds. The largest and most {{widespread}} genus is Caprimulgus, characterised by stiff bristles around the mouth, long pointed wings, a comb-like middle claw and patterned plumage. The males, and sometimes females, often have white markings in the wing or tail. Within the genus, the European nightjar forms a <b>superspecies</b> with the rufous-cheeked nightjar and the sombre nightjar, African species with similar songs. It is replaced further east in Asia by the jungle nightjar which occupies similar habitat.|$|E
5|$|Members of the red-breasted {{nuthatch}} <b>superspecies</b> excavate their own tree holes, although most other nuthatches use natural holes or old woodpecker nests. Several species {{reduce the size}} of the entrance hole and seal up cracks with mud. The {{red-breasted nuthatch}} makes the nest secure by daubing sticky conifer resin globules around the entrance, the male applying the resin outside and the female inside. The resin may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the resin by diving straight through the entrance hole). The white-breasted nuthatch smears blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian, chestnut-vented, Kashmir and chestnut-bellied nuthatches form another <b>superspecies</b> {{and replace}} each other {{geographically}} across Asia. They are currently {{considered to be}} four separate species, but the south-Asian forms were once {{believed to be a}} subspecies of the Eurasian nuthatch. A recent change in this taxonomy is a split of the chestnut-bellied nuthatch into three species, namely the Indian nuthatch, Sitta castanea, found south of the Ganges, the Burmese nuthatch, Sitta neglecta, found in southeast Asia, and the chestnut-bellied nuthatch sensu stricto, S. cinnamoventris, which occurs in the Himalayas. Mitochondrial DNA studies have demonstrated that the white-breasted northern subspecies of Eurasian nuthatch, S. (europea) arctica, is distinctive, and also a possible candidate for full species status. This split has been accepted by the British Ornithologists' Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{mourning}} dove {{is closely related}} to the eared dove (Zenaida auriculata) and the Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni). Some authorities describe them as forming a <b>superspecies</b> and these three birds are sometimes classified in the separate genus Zenaidura, but the current classification has them as separate species in the genus Zenaida. In addition, the Socorro dove has at times been considered conspecific with the {{mourning dove}}, although several differences in behavior, call, and appearance justify separation as two different species. While the three species do form a subgroup of Zenaida, using a separate genus would interfere with the monophyly of Zenaida by making it paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|The nuthatches {{are all in}} {{the genus}} Sitta Linnaeus, 1758, a name derived from , Ancient Greek for this bird. Nuthatch refers to the {{propensity}} of some species to wedge a large insect or seed in a crack and hack at it with their strong bills. Species boundaries in the nuthatches are difficult to define. The red-breasted nuthatch, Corsican nuthatch and Chinese nuthatch have breeding ranges separated by thousands of kilometres, but are similar in habitat preference, appearance and song. They were formerly considered to be one species, but are now normally split into three and comprise a <b>superspecies</b> along with the Krüper's and Algerian nuthatch. Unusually for nuthatches, all five species excavate their own nests.|$|E
5|$|The {{whistling}} ducks, Dendrocygna, are {{a distinctive}} {{group of eight}} bird species within the duck, goose and swan family Anatidae, which are characterised by a hump-backed, long-necked appearance and the whistled flight calls that give them their English name. They were an early split from the main duck lineage, and were predominant in the Late Miocene before the subsequent extensive radiation of more modern forms in the Pliocene and later. The fulvous whistling duck forms a <b>superspecies</b> with the wandering whistling duck. It has no recognised subspecies, although the birds in northern Mexico and the southern US {{have in the past}} been assigned to D. b. helva, described as having paler and brighter underparts and a lighter crown than D. b. bicolor.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle {{was first}} {{described}} by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, although John Latham had made notes on the species in 1781, from a specimen obtained in February 1780 at Princes Island off the westernmost cape of Java during Captain Cook's last voyage. Its specific name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek leuko- 'white', and gaster 'belly'. Its closest relative is the little-known Sanford's sea eagle of the Solomon Islands. These form a <b>superspecies,</b> and as is usual in other sea eagle <b>superspecies,</b> one (the white-bellied sea eagle) has a white head, as opposed to the other species' dark head. The bill and eyes are dark, and the talons are dark yellow as in all Southern Hemisphere sea eagles. Both these species have at least some dark colouration in their tails, though this may not always be clearly visible in the white-bellied sea eagle. The nucleotide sequences of the cytochrome b gene of the two sea eagles were among those analysed in a 1996 study. Although they differ greatly in appearance and ecology, their genetic divergence of 0.3% indicates that the ancestors of the two forms might have diverged as recently as 150,000 years ago. The study authors conclude that although the genetic divergence is more consistent with subspecies, the distinctness in appearance and behaviour warrants the two being retained as separate species. Mitochondrial sequence of the cytochrome b locus differs very slightly from that of Sanford's sea eagle suggesting a relatively recent divergence after New Guinea-based white-bellied sea eagles colonised the Solomon Islands.|$|E
5|$|Since {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} extinct macaws exist only for the species on Cuba, {{it is impossible to}} determine the species' relationships. It has been suggested that the closest mainland relative of the Cuban macaw is the scarlet macaw (Ara macao), due to the similar distribution of red and blue in their plumage, and the presence of a white patch around the eyes, naked except for lines of small red feathers. Furthermore, the range of the scarlet macaw extends to the margins of the Caribbean Sea. The Cuban macaw is distinct due to its lack of a yellow shoulder patch, its all-black beak, and its smaller size. The two also share a species of feather mite, which supports their relationship. James Greenway believed the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a <b>superspecies</b> with the other extinct species suggested to have inhabited Jamaica, Hispaniola and Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart was {{originally}} described in 1894 as Phlogoenas menagei by Frank Swift Bourns and Dean Conant Worcester. The holotype, a male, was collected by {{them from the}} small island of Tataan {{off the coast of}} Tawi-Tawi in October 1891. The specific name, menagei, honors Louis F. Menage, a Minnesota real estate tycoon who funded the expedition. It {{is a member of the}} bleeding-heart <b>superspecies,</b> which includes Luzon bleeding-heart, Mindanao bleeding-heart, Mindoro bleeding-heart, and Negros bleeding-heart; these birds are so similar that some authors have considered them to be a single species. Some authors place the Sulu bleeding-heart, the other bleeding-hearts, and the cinnamon ground dove in their own subgenus, Gallicolumba. The Sulu bleeding-heart has no known subspecies. It is also called the Tawitawi bleeding-heart and the Tawitawi Puñalada.|$|E
5|$|The American {{zoologist}} Austin Hobart Clark {{gave the}} Lesser Antillean macaw its scientific name, Ara guadeloupensis, in 1905, {{based on the}} contemporary accounts, and he also cited a 1765 color plate as possibly depicting this species. He wrote that it was different in several ways from the superficially similar scarlet macaw (A. macao), {{as well as the}} green-winged macaw (A. chloropterus) and the Cuban macaw (A. tricolor). Clark suggested the species might have existed on the islands of Dominica and Martinique, based on accounts of red macaws there, as well as on Guadeloupe. In his 1907 book Extinct Birds, the British zoologist Walter Rothschild instead claimed each island had its own species, and that the Lesser Antillean macaw was confined to Guadeloupe. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway wrote that the macaws reported from Guadeloupe could have been imported to the region from elsewhere by the native population, but this is difficult to prove. Greenway also suggested that the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a <b>superspecies</b> with the Lesser Antillean macaw and other hypothetical extinct species suggested for Jamaica and Hispaniola. According to the English paleontologist Julian Hume, the similarity between the Lesser Antillean macaw and the scarlet macaw indicates that they were close relatives, and that the Guadeloupe species may have descended from the mainland macaw.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} (Picathartes oreas) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird in the}} family Picathartidae with a long neck and tail. Also known as the grey-necked picathartes, this passerine is mainly found in rocky areas of close-canopied rainforest from south-west Nigeria through Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and south-west Gabon. It additionally lives {{on the island of}} Bioko. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and inselbergs in its forested habitat. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a <b>superspecies</b> with the white-necked rockfowl. The grey-necked rockfowl has grey upperparts, a light grey breast, and lemon-coloured underparts. Its unusually long tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being powder blue on the forehead and upper mandible and carmine on the hindcrown. The bird’s cheeks and eyes are covered in a large, circular black patch that, though narrow, connects and divides the carmine and powder blue skin {{at the peak of the}} crown. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.|$|E
25|$|A <b>superspecies</b> of the New Zealand region. Peculiarly apomorphic, with {{yellowish}} legs, prominent double crests, white ornamental plumes on the neck, a grey {{belly and}} spotted wings.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authorities}} consider P. napi to be a <b>superspecies</b> {{that includes}} the American species mustard white and West Virginia white {{as well as the}} European dark-veined white.|$|E
25|$|It forms a <b>superspecies</b> with R. dryas and R. semirubra, and {{all three}} are often {{considered}} conspecific. All {{are part of a}} larger species group that also includes R. teysmanni, R. superflua, R. dedemi, R. opistherythra, R. lepida, R. rufidorsa, R. dahli, R. matthiae and R. malaitae.|$|E
25|$|The great grey shrike, {{northern}} grey shrike, or northern shrike (Lanius excubitor) {{is a large}} songbird {{species in}} the shrike family (Laniidae). It forms a <b>superspecies</b> with its parapatric southern relatives, the southern grey shrike (L. meridionalis), the Chinese grey shrike (L. sphenocerus) and the loggerhead shrike (L. ludovicianus). Within the great grey shrike species itself, there are two subspecies. Males and females are similar in plumage, pearly grey above with a black eye-mask and white underparts.|$|E
25|$|Pacific {{coast of}} South America. This species {{apparently}} has no close living relatives. It has a highly apomorphic colour pattern: naked red base of bill, red feet, {{and a white}} neck spot, and it is crestless. It seems to be convergent in some aspects with the punctatus <b>superspecies.</b> What seems sure is that this species must {{be placed in a}} distinct monotypic genus Poikilocarbo in almost any case, if any species are split from Phalacrocorax at all.|$|E
25|$|The grey shrike <b>superspecies</b> {{consists}} of L. excubitor and its parapatric southern relatives. As mentioned above, {{the other members}} of this group are the southern grey shrike (L. meridionalis), the Chinese grey shrike (L. sphenocerus) and the loggerhead shrike (L. ludovicianus). The centre of this group's radiation is probably in the eastern Mediterranean region, and the southern grey shrike represents the basalmost form. The other three only diverged during the expansion into temperate regions. This must have happened fairly recently, because lineage sorting is not complete in the grey shrikes, and most of the present-day habitat of L. excubitor was uninhabitable during much of the Quaternary glaciation. Because of the phylogenetic uncertainties surrounding this close-knit group {{in the absence of a}} good fossil record, some refrain from splitting them up into distinct species; most modern authors do so however.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, the parapatric {{relatives}} of the L. excubitor are the Chinese grey shrike (L. sphenocerus) from East Asia and the northern shrike (L. borealis) and loggerhead shrike (L. ludovicianus) from North America. The northern grey shrike is sympatric in winter quarters with each of its three close relatives at the north of their range. Their overall colouration is – apparently plesiomorphically – shared in sub-Saharan Africa by the somewhat more distantly related grey-backed fiscal (L. excubitoroides) which is found from the Sahel eastwards, and Mackinnon's fiscal (L. mackinnoni) of the Congo Basin region. The lesser grey shrike (L. minor, Balkans to Central Asia) seems to be quite distinct indeed and is sympatric with the grey shrike <b>superspecies</b> between Eastern Europe and Central Asia; {{it may be more}} closely related to the small brown shrikes and resemble the bold, aggressive and hard-to-catch grey shrikes because of Batesian mimicry.|$|E
25|$|Within the wagtail genus Motacilla, {{the white}} wagtail's closest {{relatives}} {{appear to be}} other black-and-white wagtails such as the Japanese wagtail, Motacilla grandis, and the white-browed wagtail, Motacilla madaraspatensis (and possibly the Mekong wagtail, Motacilla samveasnae, the phylogenetic position of which is mysterious), with which it appears to form a <b>superspecies.</b> However, mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data suggests that the white wagtail is itself polyphyletic or paraphyletic (i.e. the species is not itself a single coherent grouping). Other phylogenetic studies using mtDNA still {{suggest that there is}} considerable gene flow within the races and the resulting closeness makes Motacilla alba a single species. Some studies have suggested the existence of only two groups : the alboides group, with M. a. alboides, M. a. leucopsis and M. a. personata; and the alba group, with M. a. alba, M. a. yarrellii, M. a. baicalensis, M. a. ocularis, M. a. lugens, and M. a. subpersonata.|$|E
500|$|The swifts {{form the}} bird family Apodidae, which {{is divided into}} several genera. The Pacific swift is in the Old World genus Apus, which is characterised by dark, glossy plumage, a forked tail and sharply pointed wings. Until recently, the Pacific swift was {{considered}} to have five subspecies, but three have now been elevated to full species status {{as part of a}} [...] "fork-tailed swift" [...] <b>superspecies.</b> The proposed name of the <b>superspecies</b> was formerly a synonym for the Pacific swift.|$|E
500|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} forms a <b>superspecies</b> {{with the}} rufous-chested sparrowhawk of {{eastern and southern}} Africa, and possibly the Madagascan sparrowhawk.

Within the species itself, six subspecies are generally recognised: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{distinctness}} of {{this species}} {{has been described as}} weak by some authors, [...] although its status as a full species has been maintained. It forms a <b>superspecies</b> with Jackson's francolin, handsome francolin, chestnut-naped francolin, and Erckel's francolin; it is particularly closely related to the latter two species and is intermediate to them in both location and morphological features. The Djibouti francolin has no recognized subspecies.|$|E
500|$|The black currawong {{was first}} {{described}} by ornithologist John Gould in 1836 as Cracticus fuliginosus, and in 1837 as Coronica fuliginosa. The specific epithet is the Late Latin adjective fuliginosus [...] "sooty" [...] from Latin fūlīgo [...] "soot", and {{refers to the}} black plumage. American ornithologist Dean Amadon regarded the black currawong as a subspecies of the pied currawong (Strepera graculina), seeing {{it as part of}} a continuum with subspecies ashbyi of the latter species, the complex having progressively less white plumage as one moves south. Subsequent authors have considered it a separate species, although Richard Schodde and Ian Mason describe it as forming a <b>superspecies</b> with the pied currawong.|$|E
500|$|The bee-eaters are {{generally}} similar in appearance, {{although they are}} normally divided into three genera. Nyctyornis comprises two large species with long throat feathers, the blue-bearded bee-eater and the red-bearded bee-eater, {{both of which have}} rounded wings, a ridged culmen, feathered nostrils and a relatively sluggish lifestyle. The purple-bearded bee-eater is the sole member of Meropogon, which is intermediate between Nyctyornis and the typical bee-eaters, having rounded wings and a [...] "beard", but a smooth culmen and no nostril feathers. All the remaining species are normally retained in the single genus Merops. There are close relationships within this genus, for example the red-throated bee-eater and the white-fronted bee-eater form a <b>superspecies,</b> but formerly suggested genera, such as Aerops, Melittophagus, Bombylonax and Dicrocercus, have not been generally accepted for several decades since a 1969 paper united them in the current arrangement.|$|E
500|$|The white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster), {{also known}} as the white-breasted sea eagle, is a large diurnal bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. Originally {{described}} by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, it is closely related to Sanford's sea eagle of the Solomon Islands, and the two are considered a <b>superspecies.</b> A distinctive bird, the adult white-bellied sea eagle has a white head, breast, under-wing coverts and tail. The upper parts are grey and the black under-wing flight feathers contrast with the white coverts. The tail is short and wedge-shaped as in all Haliaeetus species. Like many raptors, the female is slightly larger than the male, and can measure up to [...] long with a wingspan of up to , and weigh [...] Immature birds have brown plumage, which is gradually replaced by white until the age of five or six years. The call is a loud goose-like honking.|$|E
500|$|In 1891, the Italian {{zoologist}} Tommaso Salvadori included Psittacus violaceus in {{a list of}} synonyms of the {{red-fan parrot}} (Deroptyus accipitrinus), a South American species. In 1905, the American zoologist Austin Hobart Clark {{pointed out that the}} colouration of the two species was dissimilar (their main similarity being a frill on the neck), and that Buffon stated that the parrot of Guadeloupe was not found in Cayenne where the red-fan parrot lives. Clark instead suggested that the Guadeloupe species was most closely related to the extant, similarly coloured imperial amazon (Amazona imperialis) of Dominica. He therefore placed the Guadeloupe bird in the same genus, with the new combination Amazona violacea, and referred to it by the common name [...] "Guadeloupe parrot". The name Amazona comes from the French word [...] "Amazone", which Buffon had used to refer to parrots from the Amazonian rainforest. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway suggested that the amazon of Guadeloupe may have formed a <b>superspecies</b> with the imperial amazon and the extinct Martinique amazon (Amazona martinicana), and was perhaps a subspecies of the former. He considered it a hypothetical extinct species since it was only known from old accounts.|$|E
500|$|The tufted tit-tyrant's genus, Anairetes, is in {{the tyrant}} flycatcher family Tyrannidae and is {{believed}} to be most closely related to the tyrannulet genera Mecocerculus and Serpophaga; however, there is no definitive evidence supporting this claim. The tufted tit-tyrant was described as Muscicapa parulus by Heinrich von Kittlitz in 1830 from a specimen collected near Valparaíso, Chile. It was later moved from the genus Muscicapa, which today solely contains Old World flycatchers, to Anairetes; however, this genus was too similar to the pre-existing genus Anaeretes, so Harry Church Oberholser erected the genus Spitzitornis for it and the other tit-tyrants. However, Spitzitornis was eventually abolished and the tit-tyrants were returned to Anairetes. The tufted tit-tyrant is believed to form a <b>superspecies</b> with the Juan Fernández tit-tyrant. Members of the genus Anairetes are commonly known as tit-tyrants because their active foraging behavior and crests are reminiscent of the true tits in the family Paridae, while the genus itself is part of the tyrant flycatcher family. The tufted tit-tyrant is known in Spanish as the Cachudito, which means [...] "little longhorn" [...] in reference to the bird's crest.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with the}} buff-banded rail and close relatives, the Tahiti rail {{has been placed}} in either the genus Gallirallus or the genus Hypotaenidia; the latter is {{considered}} a synonym of the former by some authorities. The specific name pacificus refers to the Pacific Ocean and is Latin for [...] "peaceful". The genus name Gallirallus {{is a combination of}} the genus names Gallus and Rallus. In 1977 the American ornithologist Sidney Dillon Ripley suggested that the Tahiti rail was an isolated form of buff-banded rail, and perhaps belonged to a <b>superspecies</b> with that bird and the Wake Island rail (Gallirallus wakensis). Rails {{are some of the most}} widespread terrestrial vertebrates, and have colonised practically all island groups, with many island species being flightless. In 1973 the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson argued that many insular flightless species of rails were descended from still extant flighted rails, that flightlessness had evolved independently and rapidly in many different island species, and that this feature is therefore of no taxonomic importance. Flightlessness can be advantageous (especially where food is scarce) because it conserves energy by decreasing the mass of flight muscles; the absence of predators (particularly mammalian) and a reduced need for dispersal are factors that allow this feature to develop in island birds.|$|E
500|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Anton Reichenow in 1899 from a bird {{collected at the}} base of Mount Cameroon near Limbe, Cameroon. He published his description in Ornithologische Monatsberichte and described it as Picathartes oreas. The generic name was first used by René-Primevère Lesson in 1828 after he split the grey-necked rockfowl's close relative the white-necked rockfowl from the crow genus Corvus and placed it in its own genus, Picathartes, as the white-necked rockfowl did not share characteristics common to members of Corvus such as a feathered head. This generic name comes from a combination of the Latin genera pica for [...] "magpie" [...] and cathartes for [...] "vulture". The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek word oreas, meaning [...] "mountain". Since its initial description, the picathartes have been placed in more than five different families, including those of crows (Corvidae), starlings (Sturnidae), Old World flycatchers (Muscicapidae), babblers (Timaliidae) and Old World warblers (Sylviidae). Today the grey-necked rockfowl and the white-necked rockfowl are believed to comprise a unique family, Picathartidae. Additionally, it has been suggested, though not generally accepted, that the two rockfowl represent the remnants of an ancient bird order. Recent DNA analysis has shown that Picathartidae and its closest relatives, southern Africa's rockjumpers and south-east Asia's rail-babbler, form a clade. The analysis suggests that the rockfowl split from the common ancestor of their clade 44million years ago. It is believed that the ancestor of this clade originated in Australia and spread to Africa. Though the grey-necked rockfowl has no subspecies, it may form a <b>superspecies</b> with the white-necked rockfowl, with plumage and facial pattern being the main differences between the two species.|$|E
