40|$|Background: Suicidal {{intent is}} an {{essential}} feature of suicidal behavior. Previous research has been controversial {{and the need for}} further evidence has been pointed out. Aims: The aim {{of the present study was}} to characterize the severity of attempted suicide by extracting components of suicidal intent and analyzing levels of suicidal intent by gender, age, and variables indicating the severity of attempted suicide. Methods: Data on suicide attempters (N = 469) were collected in Estonia using WHO SUPRE-MISS methodology. To measure suicidal intent, a revised version of the Pierce <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale</b> (PSIS) was used. Results: The level of suicidal intent was not gender-dependent, but rose with age. Males and females were also similar in terms of discrete components. Classified in age groups, their unequivocally expressed "wish to die" was similar, but equivocal communication (components termed "arrangements" and "circumstances") increased with age. Middle-aged groups scored higher for the "alcohol/drugs" component. Psychiatric diagnosis,method of attempting suicide, and duration of hospitalization were linked to suicidal intent, but danger to life as assessed by interviewers was not. Conclusions: In suicide-risk assessment, results from a <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale</b> contribute to clinical observation and add valuable information about a suicidal person's real intention.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to {{investigate}} Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis characteristics in relation to suicidal intent among suicide attempters with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Adjustment Disorders (AD). The relationship between suicidal intent, assessed by means of the <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale</b> (SIS), and serum cortisol after a Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST) was investigated in 78 suicide attempters, divided into diagnostic subgroups. There was a significant negative correlation between suicidal intent and post DST cortisol in patients with MDD.

40|$|Suicides {{in prisons}} are common. There is a {{pressing}} {{need to understand}} more about the causes and prevention of prisoner suicides. A particularly informative approach is through studying survivors of near-lethal suicide attempts. However, {{the extent to which}} this approach is a good proxy for completed suicide requires verification. In this article we aimed to assess (1) the extent to which male and female prisoners who made near-lethal suicide attempts in prison are similar to prisoners who die by suicide; (2) the <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> of those making near-lethal suicide attempts; and (3) the applicability of the Suicide <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale</b> in prisons. Survivors of near-lethal suicide attempts and prisoners who died by suicide were compared on sociodemographic and criminological characteristics. The <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> of prisoners engaging in near-lethal self-harm was assessed using Beck’s Suicide <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale.</b> There were no significant differences when the sociodemographic and criminological profiles of prisoners who made near-lethal suicide attempts and those who died by suicide were compared, except that male prisoners who made near-lethal suicide attempts were somewhat younger. Most prisoners carrying out near-lethal acts had high <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent.</b> However, some questions in the Suicide <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale</b> were inappropriate for assessing intent in prisoners. Prisoners who survive near-lethal self-harm would appear to be a valid proxy for those who die by suicide in prison.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Self-harm is {{associated}} with a high risk of suicide. It is unclear whether <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> at the time of self-harm is a risk factor for future suicidal behaviour. AIMS: To investigate the relationship between <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> and patient characteristics, repetition of self-harm, and suicide. METHOD: Clinical and demographic data on 4415 patients presenting to hospital following self-harm between 1993 and 2000 were analysed. <b>Suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> was measured using the Beck Suicide <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale</b> (SIS). Follow-up information on repetition of self-harm and suicide was investigated for 2489 patients presenting between 1993 and 1997. RESULTS: <b>Suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> at the time of self-harm was associated with risk of subsequent suicide, especially within the first year and among female patients. Suicide was more strongly associated with scores on the circumstances section of the SIS than the self-report section. The association between repetition of self-harm and SIS scores was different for male and female patients. CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> in the assessment of self-harm patients is beneficial for the evaluation of future suicide risk. A shortened measuring scale might be useful in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Conflicting {{findings}} have been reported regarding {{the relationship between the}} potential lethality of acts of deliberate self-harm (DSH) and <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent,</b> and how each relates to patient characteristics. This study examines the relationship of <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> of DSH to lethality, the relationship of both to patient characteristics, and determines if intent or lethality are risk factors for repetition of DSH. Potential lethality and Suicide <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale</b> (SIS) scores for DSH episodes were examined in a representative sample of 150 patients presenting to a general hospital. Follow-up interviews were completed 12 to 20 months later. Lethality was strongly associated with high intent. Both lethality and intent were associated with male gender. <b>Suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> but not lethality was associated with the presence of psychiatric disorder and depression. Intent was significantly correlated with hopelessness <b>scale</b> score. Although <b>intent</b> was correlated with both depression and self-esteem scale scores, these correlations became nonsignificant when the effect of hopelessness was removed. Repetition of DSH during the follow-up period was related to neither lethality nor intent scores for the original episodes. Lethality and <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent,</b> although related, have somewhat different correlates. Both should be considered when assessing DSH patients, but their relationship to further suicidal behavior {{does not appear to be}} straightforward...|$|R
40|$|An {{objective}} way {{to measure}} the severity of suicide attempt is to use different psychometric scales. Aspects of suicide risk like suicidal intent, depression, hopelessness and well-being can be assessed and different practical scales are in use to facilitate the risk assessment procedure. The aims of current study were: 1) to analyse the association between the severity of suicide attempt measured by <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> <b>scale</b> and characteristics of emotional status of suicide attempters measured by depression, hopelessness and well-being scales in different gender and age groups; 2) to test the applicability of well-being measured by the World Health Organisation well-being index (WHO- 5) in suicide risk assessment. The data on suicide attempters (n 469) was obtained in Estonia (Tallinn) by the WHO Suicide Prevention*Multisite Intervention Study on Suicidal Behaviours (SUPRE-MISS) methodology. Different psychometric scales were used to measure suicidal intent (Pierce <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale)</b> and emotional status (Beck Depression Inventory for depression, Beck Hopelessness Scale for hopelessness, WHO- 5 for well-being). All psychometric scales correlated well with each other (PB 0. 05). Low level of well-being associated with high level of suicidal intent, depression and hopelessness. Suicidal intent correlated the most strongly with well-being. Analysis by gender and age groups revealed also significant correlations with two exceptions only: correlation between suicidal intent and hopelessness did not reach the significant level in males and in older adults (40).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Deliberate self-harm (DSH) {{may occur}} in {{response}} to negative life events and life problems. High <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> may be {{a risk factor for}} subsequent suicide but little is known about how life problems and <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> are related. The aims of this study were to examine life problems according to age, gender, <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> and other patient characteristics in DSH patients. METHODS: Data from the Oxford Monitoring System for Attempted Suicide were used to investigate life problems contributing to DSH and their relationship to patient variables including Suicide <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale</b> (SIS) scores in DSH patients presenting to the general hospital in Oxford between 1993 and 2000. Of 4391 persons included in the study 80. 6 % reported multiple life problems, the most common being in the relationship with spouse or partner. The nature of the most frequent problems changed over the life-span and there were gender differences. Females, but not males, with high <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> had more problems than those with low intent and for females with no past history of DSH there was a weak positive correlation between the number of life problems and total SIS score. Patients with high intent more frequently experienced psychiatric and social isolation problems than those with low intent. Females with high intent more frequently reported bereavement or loss and eating problems. LIMITATIONS: The study population was not entirely representative of all DSH patients presenting to hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Most DSH patients have multiple life problems and the type of problems may be associated with varying degrees of <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent.</b> Patients should be offered interventions individually tailored according to their specific problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate associations between suicidal intent and psychiatric symptoms, and to study the usefulness of the <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale</b> (SIS) and the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) for suicide risk assessment in an inpatient population. One hundred and ninety-six suicide attempters, of whom 15 eventually committed suicide, were admitted to a psychiatric ward. They were assessed by means of the SIS and the CPRS. Cox regression analyses were performed in order to adjust the relationships between the individual CPRS subscales and suicide for age and gender. The patients who later completed suicide had higher scores on the CPRS than the patients who did not complete suicide. We found no associations between symptoms and suicidal intent. The severity of psychopathology, in terms of high CPRS scores, shows a stronger association with future suicide than the level of suicidal intent (SIS) among inpatient suicide attempters. Suicidal intent is evidently scored regardless of psychiatric symptoms...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Suicidal intent at {{the time}} of {{deliberate}} self-harm (DSH) is known to be associated with risk of future suicide in DSH patients. The predictive power of suicidal intent to identify particular individuals who are at high risk of suicide is unclear. METHOD: Clinical and demographic data on 4156 DSH patients presenting to hospital 1993 and 1997 were analysed. Follow-up information on eventual suicide was available for 2489 patients (mean follow-up 5. 2 years). The predictive value of the Beck <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale</b> (SIS) was examined using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plots. RESULTS: Thirty males (2. 9 %) and 24 females (1. 7 %) died by suicide. Despite a robust association between suicidal intent and eventual suicide, the positive predictive value (PPV) of the SIS was low (4 %). Predicted probabilities of suicide assigned to individual patients were also low, even for those who eventually died by suicide. LIMITATIONS: Assessment and follow-up information was not available for all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The SIS cannot predict which individual patients will ultimately die by suicide. Nonetheless, information regarding suicidal intent is valuable in the clinical risk assessment and management of DSH patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Suicide is a {{psychiatric}} emergency. Stressors {{in life and}} social variables (like marital status, family, and social support) are among the determinants of suicide. Hopelessness and suicidal intent are among the psychological variables that have shown promise in the prediction of suicide. Aims and Objectives: To assess stressful life events, hopelessness, suicidal intent, and sociodemographic variables in patients of attempted suicide. Materials and Methods: Fifty consecutive patients admitted with attempted suicide were interviewed. Presumptive Stressful Life Event Scale, Beck Hopelessness Scale, and Beck <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale</b> were used along with a semistructured pro forma for interview. Data were analyzed with statistical tests. Results: Sixty-six {{percent of the participants}} were females, 72 % were less than 30 years of age. Sixty-six percent of the patients had stressful life event score between 101 and 200 with the mean score of 127. The stressful life event score in those who considered they are in need of psychiatric help was significantly high. Most of the patients had mild (34 %) and moderate (40 %) degrees of hopelessness, and the mean score was 9. 64. The mean suicidal intent in the participants was 25. 14, when correlated with hopelessness score significant positive correlation was found.

40|$|Background : Depression is most {{important}} underlying diagnosis among the cases of suicide. There is dearth of information regarding <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> among people of depression and its relationship with hopelessness among Indians. Aims & Objective : To describe the intent of suicide in people with depression among the north Indian population. Material & Methods: This was a cross-sectional study at department of psychiatry, King George's Medical University, Lucknow. Subjects between age group of 18 - 60 years with major depressive disorder as per DSM-IV TR criteria were screened and included in the study.

40|$|Background: Suicide {{is one of}} the ten major {{causes of}} death in India. <b>Suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> score {{has been found to be}} a good {{predictor}} of a subsequent completed suicide. The present study was conducted to find out the socio-demographic profile and the <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> score of the cases of attempted suicide as well as to determine the association of <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> score with various factors. Methodology: We conducted the present hospital based observational cross sectional study at a rural hospital of Eastern India. 156 admitted cases with history of self-poisoning were interviewed after obtaining the informed consent. Socio-demographic information and <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> score were recorded and analyzed. Results: 55. 1 % patients were in the age group of below 20 years, 69. 2 % were females, 58. 3 % belonged to socioeconomic class V and 17. 3 % patients were illiterate. 43. 6 % were students and 28. 8 % housewives. 17. 3 % patients had history of suicidal attempts in the past and in 23. 1 % cases stress factor was present in the family. <b>Suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> score was medium in 63. 5 % patients, 10. 3 % patients had low score and 26. 2 % had high score. Different factors like age of 20 years and above, male sex, married people, people having addiction habit, previous suicidal attempt, positive family history and stress factors in family increased the <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> score whereas aged less than 20 years, female sex, unmarried people, people having no previous attempt of suicide, negative family history and absence of stress factor in the family decreased the <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> score.

40|$|A case is {{reported}} of a 36 -year-old male, {{found dead in}} his locked room, lying on a bed, dressed in his mother 2 ̆ 7 s clothes, with a plastic bag over his head, hands tied and with a barrel wooden cork in his rectum. Two pornographic magazines were found on a chair near the bed, so that the deceased could see them well. Asphyxia was controlled with a complex apparatus which consisted of two elastic luggage rack straps, the first surrounding his waist, perineum, and buttocks, and the second {{the back of his}} body, and neck. According to the psychological autopsy based on a structured interview (SCID-I, SCID-II) with his father, the deceased was single, unemployed and with a part college education. He had grown up in a poor family with a reserved father and dominant mother, and was indicative of fulfilling DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence, paraphilia involving hypoxyphilia with transvestic fetishism and anal masturbation and a borderline personality disorder. There was no evidence of previous psychiatric treatment. The Circumstances subscale of Beck’s <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale</b> (SIS-CS) pointed at the lack of final acts (thoughts or plans) in anticipation of death, and absence of a suicide note or overt communication of suicidal intent before death.

40|$|A {{decline of}} suicide rate can be {{accomplished}} by different psychiatric interventions. Early identification of individuals at risk for future suicide is especially important. Results from rating scales could add detailed information, which in turn might strengthen a psychiatric suicid risk assessment. This thesis deals with emergency evaluations and psychiatric inpatient evaluations after a suicide attempt. Intoxications with non-fatal or fatal outcome were examined. Two drugs, the analgesic dextropropoxyphene and the antidepressant amitriptyline were measured in suicides more often than expected from prescription-surveys. The <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale</b> (SIS) assesses preparations and aims and thus severity of the suicide attempt. A high SIS score combined with age above 55 years could be regarded as useful risk factors in the clinical evaluation of future suicide risk. Suicide attempters referred to psychiatric hospitalization were rated according to the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and the Suicide Assessment Scale (SUAS), which both measure different aspects of suicidality. Eventual suicides were recorded at least 12 months later. The validity of the BHS {{turned out not to be}} as good as in other studies, and our findings showed that high BHS scores are rather related to depression than to suicide risk. The SUAS has a broad set of items, which evaluate different aspects of the suicidal process. Its ability to predict suicide within one year after a suicide attempt was good. High SUAS-scores were also well associated with a combination of a biological marker of stress - postdexamethasone non-suppression of cortisol, and CSF- 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid - an often discussed marker of suicide risk. The first conclusion is that the prescription pattern in Sweden regarding dextropropoxyphene must be changed. The second is that the SIS and the SUAS are useful tools for suicide risk assessment, and especially together with already known risk factors such as high age and a diagnosis of depression...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Drug misuse {{is related}} to self-harm and suicide. However, {{relatively}} {{little is known about}} deliberate self-harm (DSH) in patients with drug problems and whether drug misuse by DSH patients is increasing. METHODS: We used data collected by the Oxford Monitoring System for Attempted Suicide to study the characteristics of DSH patients with drug problems who presented to the general hospital in Oxford between 1993 and 2006, and who underwent psychosocial assessment at their first presentation in the study period. We also studied trends in problem drug use and drugs misused over this period. RESULTS: During the 14 -year study period, 11, 426 patients presented of whom 9, 248 underwent psychosocial assessment and it was known whether or not they had a drug problem. Problem drug use was present in 805 / 9, 248 (8. 7 %) patients. Problem drug use was more common in males (13. 6 %) than in females (5. 3 %). Problem drug users were younger, more likely to be socially disadvantaged, to have a personality disorder and comorbid alcohol problems and to have a further episode of DSH within a year. Problem drug use in young females was associated with higher <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> <b>scale</b> (SIS) scores. During the study period, problem drug use and drug misuse increased in females, but not in males. Cannabis and cocaine misuse increased with time. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of help for DSH patients with problem drug use is particularly challenging due to their complex social and clinical characteristics and increased risk of further self-harm, suicide and accidental death. It may require extensive liaison between different services. The increasing misuse of drugs by female DSH patients and the higher SIS scores of young females are of concern...|$|E

40|$|Chemokines {{constitute}} {{a class of}} small inflammatory proteins that control the chemotaxis of leukocytes. They are also present in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) and contribute to diverse physiological functions, such as the regulation of cell migration, axonal growth and neuronal survival. It is to date not known whether chemokines in the CNS are affected in psychiatric disorders. In this study, chemokine levels were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 137 psychiatric patients in conjunction to a suicide attempt, and 43 healthy controls. A subgroup of patients (n= 42) was followed up with blood samples 12 years after the initial CSF collection, when they did not show suicidal behavior. The follow-up chemokine levels were compared to those of psychiatric patients (n= 17) who had never attempted suicide. Ultra-sensitive chemokine multiplex immunoassay was used to quantify eotaxin- 1 (CCL 11), interferon gamma-induced protein- 10 (IP- 10, CXCL 10), macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 β (MIP- 1 β, CCL 4), monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1, CCL 2), MCP- 4 (CCL 13) and thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC, CCL 17). Patients were diagnosed using DSM-III-R/DSM-IV, and assessed using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS), including subscales, and the <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Intent</b> <b>Scale</b> (SIS). CSF eotaxin- 1, MIP- 1 β, MCP- 1, MCP- 4 and TARC were significantly lower in suicide attempters than in healthy controls. Low chemokine levels were specifically associated with psychotic symptoms and pain. In the samples collected at follow-up, TARC was significantly lower in suicide attempters compared to psychiatric patients who had never attempted suicide. We also found a positive correlation between blood TARC and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Our study thus provides evidence of reduced chemokine levels in suicide attempters, both in the acute suicidal setting, and at long-term, compared to non-attempters. These results warrant future studies on the detailed neurobiological functions of chemokines in psychiatric patients...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the mental health, substance use, educational, and occupational outcomes of adolescents who self harm {{in a general}} population sample, and to examine whether these outcomes differ according to self reported <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent.</b> DESIGN: Population based birth cohort study. SETTING: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a UK birth cohort of children born in 1991 - 92. PARTICIPANTS: Data on lifetime history of self harm with and without <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> were available for 4799 respondents who completed a detailed self harm questionnaire at age 16 years. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mental health problems (depression and anxiety disorder), assessed using the clinical interview schedule-revised at age 18 years, self reported substance use (alcohol, cannabis, cigarette smoking, and illicit drugs) at age 18 years, educational attainment at age 16 and 19 years, occupational outcomes at age 19 years, and self harm at age 21 years. RESULTS: Participants who self harmed with and without <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> at age 16 years were at increased risk of developing mental health problems, future self harm, and problem substance misuse, with stronger associations for suicidal self harm than for non-suicidal self harm. For example, in models adjusted for confounders the odds ratio for depression at age 18 years was 2. 21 (95 % confidence interval 1. 55 to 3. 15) in participants who had self harmed without <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> at age 16 years and 3. 94 (2. 67 to 5. 83) in those who had self harmed with <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent.</b> <b>Suicidal</b> self harm, but not self harm without <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent,</b> was also associated with poorer educational and employment outcomes.

Descriptive statistics; Pearson′s Chi-square test; Multiple ANOVA; Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test were used to analyze the data at the significant level of P ≤ 0. 05. Results: In a total of 258 dental undergraduate students, academic areas of stress that were found to be statistically significant were long teaching hours (P = 0. 002); high workload (P ≤ 0. 001); frequency of tests (P ≤ 0. 001) and competition/fear of failure (P = 0. 009). Lack of interest in the profession was a statistically significant nonacademic area for stress (P ≤ 0. 001). The students of first and final year reported higher anxiety (HAM-A 13. 93 ± 6. 908 and 16. 44 ± 7. 637 respectively) and depression (HDRS 14. 29 ± 6. 302 and 14. 22 ± 5. 422); whereas <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> was reported almost the same throughout the study sample (BSI 5. 65 ± 5. 465). Conclusion: An increasing level of anxiety, depression and <b>suicidal</b> <b>intent</b> due to various stressors in undergraduate dental students indicate a need to modify current education system and timely help to have psychological healthy dental professionals in future...|$|R
