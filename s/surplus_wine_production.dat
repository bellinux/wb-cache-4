500|$|During both World Wars the Languedoc was {{responsible}} for providing the daily wine rations given to French soldiers. In 1962, Algeria gained its independence from France, bringing about {{an end to the}} blending of the stronger Algerian red wine to mask the thin le gros rouge. This event, coupled with French consumers moving away from cheap red wines in the 1970s, has contributed to several decades of <b>surplus</b> <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> in France, with Languedoc as the largest contributor to the European [...] "wine lake" [...] and recurring European Union subsidies aimed at reducing production. These developments prompted many Languedoc producers to start refocusing on higher quality, but has also led to many local and regional protests, including violent ones from the infamous Comité Régional d'Action Viticole (CRAV).|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{function of}} the St. George Opera House was a <b>wine</b> cellar. Grape <b>production</b> was an important secondary {{source of income for}} the settlers. The St. George Gardeners' Club formed in the mid-1860s to provide community support for farmers. In 1864, as one of their first projects, they built the cellar as a cool place to store <b>surplus</b> <b>wine</b> and to process grapes. It was mostly constructed below-ground along a hillside.|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} 1930 s, France faced a {{steadily}} worsening <b>surplus</b> of <b>wine</b> {{as a series}} of large harvests combined with the effects of a worldwide and domestic depression. During this period, successive governments were unwilling to limit France's <b>wine</b> <b>production.</b> The French State, believing that increased wine consumption would liquidate the surplus, therefore undertook the strategy of persuading French consumers that it was their patriotic duty to drink more wine. This article examines attempts to encourage wine consumption in France. It particularly analyses the efforts of the Comité de propagande du vin, set up by the government in 1931. It looks at the methods employed by the committee to encourage wine consumption including radio broadcasts, cinema films, poster campaigns, touring wine fairs, and sporting events. The article also discusses those groups such as teachers and doctors who supported the campaign and extended wine propaganda into France's schools and hospitals. The article suggests that the episode is a demonstration of the important role played by <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> and consumption in French national identity...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{aimed to}} analyze the EU- 27 {{position}} in the world <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> based on FAO Stat data for the period 2000 - 2008 and the main specific indicators. In 2008, the EU- 27 produced 16 million tones wine, by 13. 18 % less than in 2000, {{as a consequence of the}} decline of vine planted area. However, the EU- 27 is the top wine producer contributing by about 60 % to world <b>wine</b> <b>production.</b> About 88 % of the EU <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> is achieved in Italy, France, Spain, Germany and Portugal. Italy, France and Spain are situated on the first three positions in the world contributing by 48. 54 % to the world <b>wine</b> <b>production.</b> As a conclusion, the EU is the leader in <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> and will remain on this position in the coming future. Despite that consumption is provided to register a slight growth, <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> will continue to increase. This is an opportunity for Romania to produce and export more wine on the EU market. </p...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wine</b> <b>production</b> in Malta {{dates back}} over two {{thousand}} years {{to the time of}} the Phoenicians. In the beginning of the 20th century Marsovin and Emmanuel Delicata wineries were established. In the 1970s <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> became more serious and international grape varieties began to be planted. After joining the European Union in 2004 protective levies were lifted, pushing the producers to focus on higher quality <b>wine</b> <b>production,</b> with Marsovin especially focusing on fine DOK wines.|$|R

Nowadays, over 35% of the vineyards are cultivated with red grapes. Some of the red grapes are also used to produce rosé.|$|R

40|$|Unlike other south European Union {{countries}} with tradition in <b>wine</b> <b>production,</b> Greece {{has not yet}} exploited the industry׳s export potential.

This paper explores the drivers of <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> in Greece from a macro perspective and assesses their impact vis-à-vis international trade in order to contribute to these orientations {{for the development of}} a competitive industry that will assist Greece in the search for an exit from economic depression. The findings indicate that international trade impacts more on <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> in Greece than domestic consumption of Greek wine and that productivity boosts <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> at the same time as personnel costs are a significant impediment.

50|$|Unlike many of {{the major}} European wine regions, Slovenia's viticultural history predates Roman {{influences}} and {{can be traced back}} to the early Celtic and Illyrian tribes who began cultivating vines for <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> sometime between the 5th and 4th centuries BC. By the Middle Ages, the Christian Church controlled most of the region's <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> through the monasteries. Under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, privately owned wineries had some presence in the region but steady declined following the empire's fall and the beginning of Yugoslavia. By the end of the Second World War, co-operatives controlled nearly all of the region's <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> and quality was very low as the emphasis was on the bulk <b>wine</b> <b>production.</b> The exception was the few small private wineries in the Drava Valley region that were able to continue operation.|$|R
50|$|Successful {{ratification}} of the TPP trade agreement will likely bring significant changes to domestic Japanese <b>wine</b> <b>production.</b> Once ratified, tariffs on imported wine {{are scheduled to be}} eliminated in eight years.

Differing tariff regimes levied against the import of grapes for table consumption and <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> have often led Japanese farmers to focus on high margin table grapes at the expense of domestic <b>wine</b> <b>production.</b>|$|R
