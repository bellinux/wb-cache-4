40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare hysteresis, {{activation}} and deactivation forces {{produced by}} first-order deformation of Contour 0. 014 -in NiTi wire (Aditek, Brazil) in four brands of self-ligating brackets: Damon MX, Easy Clip, Smart Clip and In-Ovation. METHODS: Activation and deactivation forces were measured in an Instron universal tensile machine at 3 mm/minute speed to a total displacement of 4 mm. Tests were repeated eight times for each bracket/wire combination. Statistical analysis comprised ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test. RESULTS: Using a 4 -mm deformation, mean activation forces increased in the following order: Damon = 222 gf, Easy Clip = 228 gf, In-Ovation = 240 gf and Smart Clip = 306 gf. The same order was observed for mean hysteresis values, i. e., 128 gf, 140 gf, 150 gf and 206 gf, respectively. The respective values of deactivation forces for the Damon, Easy Clip, In-Ovation and Smart <b>Clip</b> <b>brackets</b> were 94 gf, 88 gf, 90 gf and 100 gf. CONCLUSIONS: Brackets with higher activation forces were accompanied by higher hysteresis values, which resulted in clinically similar deactivation forces, regardless {{of the type of}} self-ligating brackets used...|$|R

40|$|Volumetric {{irregular}} grids are {{the next}} frontier to conquer in interactive 3 D graphics. Visualization algorithms for rectilinear 256 3 data volumes have been optimized to achieve one frame/second to 15 frames/second {{depending on the}} workstation. With equivalent computational resources, irregular grids with millions of cells may take minutes to render for a new viewpoint. The {{state of the art}} for graphics rendering, PixelFlow, provides screen and object space parallelism for polygonal rendering. Unfortunately volume rendering of irregular data is at odds with the sort last architecture. I investigate parallel algorithms for direct volume rendering on PixelFlow that generalize to other compositing architectures. Experiments are performed on the Nasa Langley fighter dataset, using the projected tetrahedra approach of Shirley and Tuchman. Tetrahedral sorting is done by the circumscribing sphere approach of Cignoni et al. Key approaches include sortfirst on sort-last, world <b>space</b> subdivision by <b>clipping,</b> rearrangeable linear compositing for any view angle, and static load balancing. The new world <b>space</b> subdivision by <b>clipping</b> provides for efficient and correct rendering of unstructured data by using object <b>space</b> <b>clipping</b> planes.

40|$|Self-ligating {{brackets}} (SLBs) {{was introduced}} by Stolzenberg in the early 1930 s. Many SLBs systems have been patented since then, but few {{have been put on}} the market. Since SLBs have reduced friction and hence less force needed to produce tooth movement, they are proposed to have the potential advantages of producing more physiologically harmonious tooth movement. Here a case series of patients treated with SLBs is performed to verify the efficiency, effectiveness, and stability of treatment. Eighteen patients (8 females and 10 males, median age 19 ± 9. 2 years, min 10, max 39 years) affected by malocclusion were enrolled in this retrospective study. There were 8 class 1, 5 class 2 and 5 class 3 malocclusion, 3 cross-bites and 2 open-bite. Orthodontic treatment was performed by using 3 MUnitek Smart <b>Clip</b> <b>Brackets.</b> Lateral teleradiographic projections of the cranium were used. The cephalometric analysis was performed by using Dolphin Imaging System McLaughlin Cephalometric Analisys. Several variables related to teeth position were investigated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} and compare three alternative methods for controlling classical friction: Self-ligating brackets (SLB), special brackets (SB) and special elastomeric ligatures (SEB). METHODS: The study compared Damon MX, Smart Clip, In-Ovation and Easy <b>Clip</b> self-ligating <b>bracket</b> systems, the special Synergy brackets and Morelli's twin bracket with special 8 -shaped elastomeric ligatures. New and used Morelli brackets with new and used elastomeric ligatures {{were used as}} control. All brackets had 0. 022 x 0. 028 -in slots. 0. 014 -in nickel-titanium and stainless steel 0. 019 x 0. 025 -in wires were tied to first premolar steel brackets using each archwire ligation method and pulled by an Instron machine at a speed of 0. 5 mm/minute. Prior to the mechanical tests the absence of binding in the device was ruled out. Statistical analysis consisted of the Kruskal-Wallis test and multiple non-parametric analyses at a 1 % significance level. RESULTS: When a 0. 014 -in archwire was employed, all ligation methods exhibited classical friction forces close to zero, except Morelli brackets with new and old elastomeric ligatures, which displayed 64 and 44 centiNewtons, respectively. When a 0. 019 x 0. 025 -in archwire was employed, all ligation methods exhibited values close to zero, except the In-Ovation brackets, which yielded 45 cN, and the Morelli brackets with new and old elastomeric ligatures, which displayed 82 and 49 centiNewtons, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Damon MX, Easy Clip, Smart <b>Clip,</b> Synergy <b>bracket</b> systems and 8 -shaped ligatures proved to be equally effective alternatives for controlling classical friction using 0. 014 -in nickel-titanium archwires and 0. 019 x 0. 025 -in steel archwires, while the In-Ovation was efficient with 0. 014 -in archwires but with 0. 019 x 0. 025 -in archwires it exhibited friction that was similar to conventional brackets with used elastomeric ligatures...|$|R

OBJETIVO: comparar as forças de ativação, desativação e histerese produzidas por deformação de primeira ordem do fio superelástico Contour NiTi 0, 014 " (Aditek®) em quatro modelos de braquetes autoligáveis: Damon MX, Easy Clip, Smart Clip e In-Ovation. MÉTODOS: as forças de ativação e desativação foram medidas em máquina universal de tração Instron com velocidade de 3 mm/minuto e deslocamento de 4 mm.

30|$|To {{determine}} the required length of vertical GHEs, {{one of the}} various parameters considered in the equation is the borehole thermal resistance (Bernier 2000), which {{is the ability of}} the GHE to resist heat transfer. Selecting appropriate materials and configurations to optimize the borehole thermal resistance can help decrease borehole length. To reduce the borehole thermal resistance of GHEs made with one or more U-pipe, advances were made to develop <b>space</b> <b>clips</b> holding pipes separately, thermally enhanced grout (Kavanaugh and Allan 1999; Allan and Kavanaugh 1999; Carlson 2000; Borinaga-Treviño et al. 2013 a, 2013 b) and thermally enhanced pipe (Raymond et al. 2011 a, 2011 c). Further work has recently been conducted on coaxial GHEs, where the exchanger consists of two pipes imbricated into each other. The impact of the flow rate and the pipe diameter and thermal conductivity on the heat transfer rate was investigated with numerical simulations (Zanchini et al. 2010). Detailed experimental work was performed in the field to evaluate the borehole thermal resistance of different coaxial GHE configurations, where the external flow channel was made of several small pipes (Acuña et al. 2011) or a flexible liner molding the borehole wall and avoiding the use of backfill material (Acuña and Palm 2013). An analytical solution was also developed to estimate the vertical temperature distribution in the ascending and descending pipe of a coaxial GHE to improve the analysis of thermal response tests (Beier et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether {{repetitive}} opening and closure of self-ligating <b>bracket</b> <b>clips</b> can cause plastic deformation of the clip. METHODS: Three types of active/interactive ceramic self-ligating brackets (n = 20) were tested: In-Ovation C, Quicklear and WOW. A standardized controlled device performed 500 cycles of opening and closure movements of the <b>bracket</b> <b>clip</b> with proper instruments and techniques adapted as recommended by the manufacturer of each bracket type. Two tensile tests, one before and one after the repetitive cycles, were performed to assess the stiffness of the clips. To this end, a custom-made stainless steel 0. 40 x 0. 40 mm wire was inserted into the bracket slot and adapted to the universal testing machine (EMIC DL 2000), after which measurements were recorded. On the loading portion of the loading-unloading curve of clips, the slope fitted a first-degree equation curve to determine the stiffness/deflection rate of the clip. RESULTS: The results of plastic deformation showed no significant difference among bracket types before and after the 500 cycles of opening and closure (p = 0. 811). There were significant differences on stiffness among the three types of brackets (p = 0. 005). The WOW bracket had higher mean values, whereas Quicklear bracket had lower values, regardless of the opening/closure cycle.
