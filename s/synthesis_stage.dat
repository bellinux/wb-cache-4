50|$|A {{filter bank}} {{consists}} of an analysis stage and a <b>synthesis</b> <b>stage.</b> Each stage consists {{of a set of}} filters in parallel. The filter bank design is the design of the filters in the analysis and synthesis stages. The analysis filters divide the signal into overlapping or non-overlapping subbands depending on the application requirements. The synthesis filters should be designed to reconstruct the input signal back from the subbands when the outputs of these filters are combined together. Processing is typically performed after the analysis stage. These filter banks can be designed as Infinite impulse response (IIR) or Finite impulse response (FIR).In order to reduce the data rate, downsampling and upsampling are performed in the analysis and synthesis stages, respectively.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the visual}} {{area of the}} cortex, {{according}} to the model, the impulses call up largely at random a series of images (=activation). The dreamers sleeping consciousness automatically tries to integrate these images into {{a more or less}} coherent story, while, for example, linking them with fragments of memory from the past (=synthesis). (Similar mechanisms involving the PGO impulses have been incorporated into other dream models, namely Francis Crick and Graeme Mitchisons reverse learning theory and Michael Jouvets endogenous learning hypothesis.) The activation-synthesis hypothesis, although based on neurological data more advanced than was ever available to Freud, is reminiscent of Freuds psychoanalytic model in that the initial input to the process is primitive and chaotic, onto which some order in imposed by a cognitively more advanced process. But as for the psychological interpretation of dreams the authors of the activation-synthesis hypothesis are outspokenly anti-Freudian, in that in their model the initial input to the dreaming process (the PGO-impulses) are devoid of any depth-psychology significance, Oedipal or whatever.

5000|$|After a brief {{apprenticeship}} {{in applying}} standard versions of ligand field modelling to transition metal complexes, tackling single-crystal polarized spectra and magnetic anisotropy of Ni(II) and Co(II) complexes {{in the less}} usual five-coordination states, Werner Urland conceived his own [...] "trademark" [...] devising a ligand-field potential for f electrons {{in the frame of}} Angular Overlap Model.Immediate applications clarified the meaning of the parameters, taking rare-earth hydroxides and chlorides as case studies. Many papers developed in this domain were single authored, marking the original perspective of Werner Urland. Briefly, describing the situation of Ligand field theory, practically equivalent to Crystal Field Theory pointing that this method is more popular, often invoked in qualitative respects, for transition metal systems (coordination and solid phase compounds) [...] while for f-elements (lanthanide and actinide compounds) it is regarded as a rather specialized field, due to somewhat more complicated technical stances. A conceptual drawback is the lack of chemical intuitiveness of the parameters of classical ligand field theories. There are several conventions, such as Wybourne or Stevens parameterizations [...] An alternate offer was identified in the Angular Overlap Model basically developed for d-type transition metal systems [...] It is the merit of Werner Urland for stating the AOM version for f-type compounds, advocating for it by systematic applications acting as proof for the validity of this approach. The theoretical activity was complemented by involvement in synthetic coordination chemistry, producing new coordination compounds taken as relevant new case studies for ligand field interpretation of magnetic properties. A series consisting in individual octahedral units LnCl63−, is interesting by the intrinsic simplicity of these complexes, once is known that lanthanide complexes are usually adopting higher coordination numbers, the hexa-coordination being enforced mostly by the doping regime, in solid lattices, such as elpasolites (a variety of Halide minerals with ABM2X3 stoichiometry). The magnetic properties of LnCl63− complexes (with pyridinium counter ions) were analysed in the non-trivial details of the causal role of the ligand field effects. In the same spirit, a detailed attention was devoted to the relatively simple lanthanide pentakis nitrato complexes, starting from the <b>synthesis</b> <b>stage</b> [...] continued into the instrumental and theoretical characterization. The Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of the pentakis nitrato ytterbate(III), Yb(NO3)52− [...] was recorded and modelled, the ligand field treatment being based also on advanced neutron spectroscopy measurements.A peculiar manifestation, discovered {{in the light of the}} developed methodologies, was the first report of level crossing in ligand field diagrams, tuned by external pressure.A systematic attention was devoted to the magnetism determined by lanthanide ions in solid compounds like the ternary oxides, CsLnO2 [...] or Cs2MLnX6 elpasolite type systems, with various combination of (M = Na, K, Rb) alkaline metal ions and (X=F, Cl, Br) halides, for several Ln(III) rare earth cases. Werner Urland proved the ligand field as the determinant for the pattern of magnetic susceptibility dependences on temperature, often mistakenly attributed to inter-center exchange coupling.A distinct branch of investigation concerned the unusual ferromagnetic Gd(III)-Gd(III) exchange coupling recorded in newly synthesized homo-polynuclear compexes of gadolinium with various carboxylates (acetate, fluoro- and chloro- substituted acetate) as bridging ligand.|$|E

Low-dimensional geometrical lip features, such as trajectories of landmarks on the outer lip contour and vertical distances for the mouth opening are first extracted from the images.

By carefully exploiting physical constraints of lip movement both in the learning and <b>synthesis</b> <b>stages,</b> realistic <b>synthesis</b> of novel sequences is achieved. Recognition is performed using classification methods, such as nearest neighbors and support vector machines, combined with various metrics based on subspace angles and kernels, such as the Binet-Cauchy, Martin, and Kullback-Leibler kernels.
