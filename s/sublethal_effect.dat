However, {{negative effects of}} this cultivar on the honey bee Apis mellifera L., the most important pollinator for cultivated ecosystem, remained poorly investigated. The objective of our study was to evaluate the potential side effects of transgenic Cry 1 Ac + CpTI pollen from cotton on young adult honey bees A. mellifera L. Two points emphasized the significance of our study: (1) A higher expression level of insecticidal protein Cry 1 Ac in pollen tissues was detected (when compared with previous reports). In particular, Cry 1 Ac protein was detected at 300  ±  4. 52  ng g− 1 [part per billion (ppb) ] in pollen collected in July, (2) Effects on chronic mortality and feeding behaviour in honey bees were evaluated using a no-choice dietary feeding protocol with treated pollen, which guarantee the highest exposure level to bees potentially occurring in natural conditions (worst case scenario). Tests were also conducted using imidacloprid-treated pollen at a concentration of 48  ppb as positive control for <b>sublethal</b> <b>effect</b> on feeding behaviour. Our results suggested that Cry 1 Ac + CpTI pollen carried no lethal risk for honey bees. However, during a 7 -day oral exposure to the various treatments (transgenic, imidacloprid-treated and control), honey bee feeding behaviour was disturbed and bees consumed significantly less CCRI 41 cotton pollen than {{in the control group}} in which bees were exposed to conventional cotton pollen. It may indicate an antifeedant effect of CCRI 41 pollen on honey bees and thus bees may be at risk because of large areas are planted with transgenic Bt cotton in China.

Towards the end of the incubation period, the pronounced increase of MBC at PS-NP- 10 might be due to an increased PS-NP antimicrobial activity to some microbial genera over time.

One potential <b>sublethal</b> <b>effect</b> is reduced nutrient gains from diets diluted by consumption of debris. Post-hatchling and juvenile loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) consume substantial quantities of debris. We evaluated the effects of dietary dilution on voluntary intake in post-hatchling loggerheads to assess their ability {{to compensate for the}} presence of inert diluents in their diet by increasing dry mass intakes to maintain nutrient gains. Mean daily intakes of dry mass did not increase significantly with dietary dilution, so intakes of energy and nitrogen on a 50 % dilution diet were significantly lower than on a 10 % dilution diet. Therefore, post-hatchling loggerheads have an extremely limited ability to compensate for dietary dilution and would experience sublethal effects from decreased energy and nitrogen gains on dilute diets. Decreased nutrient intakes have serious conservation implications because of possible decreased growth rates, longer developmental periods at sizes most vulnerable to predation, depleted energy reserves, reduced reproductive output, and decreased survivorship...|$|E

Honey bees were treated with two types of neonicotinoid insecticide (clothianidin, dinotefuran) and two types of previously common insecticide (etofenprox [pyrethroid] and fenitrothion [organophosphate]) at five different doses (one-half, one-fourth, one-tenth, one-twentieth, and one-fortieth of their median lethal dose- LD 50). Then the bees were released 500 m from their hives in the field. The proportions of successful homing flights by bees exposed to neonicotinoids and pyrethroid decreased with doses of one-tenth LD 50 (2. 18 ng / head for clothianidin, 7. 5 ng / head for dinotefuran) or more and one-fourth LD 50 (32. 5 ng / head for pyrethroid) or more, respectively, whereas bees exposed to organophosphate did not signifi-cantly show a response at any sublethal dose though the trend in decline appeared to. Flight times were not significantly different among treatments at any dose.
