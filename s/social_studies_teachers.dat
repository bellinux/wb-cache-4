2500|$|Instructors {{appear to}} use podcasts {{in several ways}} within {{academic}} settings. For example, podcasts are used to duplicate the classroom lecture. [...] The student attends the lecture and uses the podcast as a backup for reviewing complex topics. Podcasts are also used to share additional information with students {{in the form of}} audio recordings that aid student learning and provide support in relation to core learning materials. This includes assignment tips, hints, and pre/post-assignment feedback, along with additional audio to supplement subject content. Language, Science and <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> <b>teachers</b> in K-12 settings use podcasts of news coverage, historically significant speeches, cultural events and official happenings as rich trappings for the teaching-learning process. Students in a French or Political Science class can listen, for example, to a podcast of former French President Jacques Chirac's actual voice as he departs his presidential position. They could also listen to French citizens as they discuss Chirac's position.|$|E

5000|$|... 2003 - Manhattan/Hunter College High School for Sciences: Students {{spend their}} {{first three years}} in classes in the MLK complex. Seniors spend their entire fourth {{year of high school}} on the Hunter College campus on the Upper East Side, taking a mix of high school and college-level courses. Manhattan Hunter Science {{is a part of the}} Early College Initiative. While many New York City high schools offer {{students}} the chance to take college courses, what makes Manhattan Hunter different is the level of support the students receive. Their high school English and <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> <b>teachers</b> travel with them to the college and offer regular classes there. While the students take college courses in math and science, the high school English and <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> <b>teachers</b> offer hand-holding and advice for all the subjects. The college courses in math and science tend to be large lecture classes, with as many as 600 students. A collaboration between Hunter College and the New York City Department of Education, Manhattan/Hunter High School for Science makes an unusual effort to ensure that students are prepared not only for college-level academics, but also for the freedom and responsibility of college life. The new school is designed to address the fact that more than one-third of college students nationally drop out before completing their freshman year.|$|E

Physical education, health, history, and <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> <b>teachers</b> can educate all students to have more social awareness and create a positive school climate. They continue to note that inviting parents, teachers, administrators and other key stakeholders to identify and/or participate in the development of age-appropriate LGBT-inclusive lessons that teachers can use in their classrooms is most beneficial.|$|E
