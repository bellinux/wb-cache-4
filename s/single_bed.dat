5|$|Epstein {{died of an}} {{overdose}} of Carbitral, a form of barbiturate or sleeping pill, in his locked bedroom, on 27 August 1967. He was discovered after his butler had knocked on the door, and then hearing no response, asked the housekeeper to call the police. Epstein was found on a <b>single</b> <b>bed,</b> dressed in pyjamas, with various correspondence spread over a second <b>single</b> <b>bed.</b> At the statutory inquest his death was officially ruled an accident; caused by a gradual buildup of Carbitral in his system, combined with alcohol. It was revealed {{that he had taken}} six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably normal for him, but in combination with alcohol they reduced his tolerance to lethal levels.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} <b>single</b> <b>bed</b> next to the bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room.

In many bathhouses (particularly those outside the United States), {{some or all of}} the rooms are freely available to all patrons.|$|E

5|$|Myra Hindley {{was born}} in Crumpsall on 23 July 1942 and raised in Gorton, then a working-class area of Manchester. Her parents, Nellie and Bob Hindley (the latter an alcoholic), beat her {{regularly}} as a young child. The small house the family lived in was in such poor condition that Hindley and her parents had {{to sleep in the}} only available bedroom, she in a <b>single</b> <b>bed</b> next to her parents' double. The family's living conditions deteriorated further when Hindley's sister, Maureen, {{was born in}} August 1946. About a year after the birth, Hindley, then 5, was sent by her parents to live with her grandmother, whose home was nearby.|$|E

Guede said he had left Kercher fully dressed. He was found guilty in October 2008 of murder and sexual assault, and sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment.

500|$|Kirchherr later {{supplied}} Sutcliffe and {{the other}} Beatles with Preludin, which, when taken with beer, made them feel euphoric and helped to keep them awake until {{the early hours of}} the morning. The Beatles had taken Preludin before, but it was possible at that time to get Preludin only with a doctor's prescription note, so Kirchherr's mother got them from a local chemist, who supplied them without asking questions. After meeting Kirchherr, Lennon filled his letters to Cynthia Powell (his girlfriend at the time) with [...] "Astrid said this, Astrid did that", which made Powell jealous, until she read that Sutcliffe was in a relationship with Kirchherr. When Powell visited Hamburg with Dot Rhone (McCartney's girlfriend at the time) in April 1961, they stayed at Kirchherr's house. In August 1963, Kirchherr met Lennon and Cynthia in Paris while they were both there for a belated honeymoon, as Kirchherr was there with a girlfriend for a few days' holiday. The four of them went from wine bar to wine bar and finally ended up back at Kirchherr's lodgings, where all four fell asleep on Kirchherr's <b>single</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
500|$|Loev {{garnered}} {{praise from}} critics at film festivals {{all across the}} world; commentators were largely laudatory of the film's sensitive treatment of the theme of homosexuality and the performances of the cast. Reviewing the film at Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, Shelagh Rowan-Legg of Screen Anarchy praised the refreshing concept of the film, different from the usual cinema associated with India: [...] "Loev examines the personal and the political, [...] in a sensitive yet open portrait of love and sexuality". She further called the cast [...] "tailor-made", lauding Pandit in particular, saying, [...] "Pandit perfectly times the slow release of his frustration, [...] is both appalling and believable". Finding Ganesh to be [...] "a charismatic presence on screen", Screen Internationals Wendy Ide—less impressed with the cast's performances—stated, [...] "naturalistic acting style notwithstanding, there is something not entirely persuasive {{about the relationship between}} Jai and Sahil". In a 4/5 star review at the , Eddie Falvey praised Loevs delicate handling of the subject matter, saying that the [...] "simple but striking image of two men attempting awkward intimacy in a <b>single</b> <b>bed</b> epitomises the tragic restrictions that are placed on love throughout the world." [...] She deemed it vital filmmaking from a [...] "powerful new voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Felix Krämer {{published}} an article in which he took issue with Reff's conclusions. In particular, Krämer wrote of the [...] "critical" [...] discrepancy between the marital bedroom described by Zola and the narrow, <b>single</b> <b>bed</b> in the painting; in addition, {{the placement of the}} man's top hat on the bureau in the background suggests that the man has not just entered the room, as Laurent has in the passage quoted above.|$|E
2500|$|The {{passengers}} mostly {{slept and}} lived in the low-ceilinged great cabins and on the main deck, which was 75 by 20 (23 m × 6 m) at most. The cabins were thin-walled and extremely cramped, and the total area was 25 ft by 15 ft (7.6 m × 4.5 m) at its largest.

2500|$|Historians such as Donald {{point out}} {{it was not unusual}} at that time for two men to share even a small bed due to {{financial}} or other circumstances, without anything sexual being implied, for a night or two when nothing else was available. But for a wealthy man to share a <b>single</b> <b>bed</b> with the same man {{over a long period of}} time shows a sustained relationship.

Between 1941 and 1944, Chikatilo witnessed some {{of the effects of}} the Nazi occupation of Ukraine, which he described as [...] "horrors", adding he witnessed bombings, fires, and shootings from which he and his mother would hide in cellars and ditches. On one occasion, Chikatilo and his mother were forced to watch their own hut burn to the ground.
