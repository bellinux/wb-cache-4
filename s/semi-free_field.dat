40|$|The type {{approval}} of motor vehicles according to ECE R 51 is performed on standardized road surfaces and under defined conditions. The type test {{takes place in}} the open air and is highly dependent on the local weather conditions. The Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics IBP operates a four-wheel drive dynamometer where this measurement can be simulated in a <b>semi-free</b> <b>field</b> acoustic environment. Influences, such as the modified foot print of the tires, the surface of the roller and the floor, cause divergences to the pass-by measurements performed on the test track. Today the standard ISO/FDIS 362 - 3 for measurement of pass-by noise levels in test halls is emerging. There, the method A describes a procedure combinig simulated pass-by (drive train noise component) and real pass-by (tire rolling noise component). With a validation procedure the precision of such a simulated pass-by in the test rig may be compared with a real dynamometer at Fraunhofer-IBP. The procedure, the essential factors and the results of the measurements are presented and evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Background: High-speed railway (HR, Electrified railway with {{service speed}} above 200 km/h.) noise and {{conventional}} railway (CR, Electrified railway with service speed under 200 km/h.) noise {{are different in}} both time and frequency domain. There is an urgent need to study the influence of HR noise and consequently, develop appropriate noise evaluation index and limits for the total railway noise including HR and CR noise. Methods: Based on binaural recording of HR and CR noises in a approximate <b>semi-free</b> <b>field,</b> noise annoyance and activity disturbance induced by maximal train pass-by events in China were investigated through laboratory subjective evaluation. 80 students within recruited 102 students, 40 males and 40 females, 23. 9 [*]±[*] 2. 1 years old, were finally selected as the subjects. After receiving noise stimulus via headphone of a binaural audio playback system, {{subjects were asked to}} express the annoyance or activity disturbance due to railway noise at a 0 - 100 numerical scale. Results: The results show that with the same annoyance rating (A) or activity disturbance rating (D), the A-weighted equivalent sound pressure level (LAeq) of CR noise is approximately 7 dB higher than that of HR noise. Linear regression analysis between some acoustical parameters and A (or D) suggests that the coefficient of determination (R 2) is higher with the instantaneous fast A-weighted sound pressure level (LAFmax) than that with LAeq. A combined acoustical parameter, LHC[*]=[*] 1. 74 LAFmax[*]+[*] 0. 008 LAFmax(Lp-LAeq), where Lp is the sound pressure level, was derived consequently, which could better evaluate the total railway noise, including HR and CR noise. More importantly, with a given LHC, the noise annoyance of HR and CR noise is the same. Conclusions: Among various acoustical parameters including LHC and LAeq, A and D have the highest correlation with LHC. LHC has been proved to be an appropriate index to evaluate the total railway noise, including both HR and CR. However, {{it should be pointed out}} that this study provides suggestive evidence, rather than a final proof. Further study is expected to elucidate conclusions above by additional measurements...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} effects of natural and {{sustainable}} materials including vegetation, green roof systems and green walls on outdoor noise control in urban areas. The concept of this study starts with a hypothesis that well-planned use of the natural materials on building and urban surfaces can achieve useful reductions in noise levels and reverberation in urban spaces. Firstly, this study examines random-incidence absorption and scattering coefficients of vegetation {{through a series of}} measurements in a reverberation chamber in order to characterise {{the effects of}} various designable factors such as soil depths, soil water content and vegetation densities. This data is used later in acoustic computer simulations. To quantify the scattering effect of trees and to allow including it in numerical predictions, a series of measurements are carried out for individual trees in an open field. Green roof systems are placed on a low profiled structure to examine sound transmission through the vegetated low barrier. To suggest noise abatement schemes in relatively small urban spaces, the acoustic effects of landscape designs using vegetation in a courtyard are studied through a case study. As a preliminary study on the noise reduction effect of vegetation in relatively large urban spaces, field measurements are carried out at outdoor spaces in high-rise apartment complexes. Based on the measurement results, the noise reduction effect of vegetation in apartment complexes is also predicted. The overall results for each research topic can be summarised as follows: It is shown that low-growing vegetation can be an effective measure for absorbing/scattering sound energy, especially at high frequencies. Results of field measurements show that tree reverberation exerts an influence only on frequencies above 1 kHz. At 4 kHz, RT (reverberation time) can be as long as 0. 28 sec. Measurements made near the same deciduous tree with and without leaves indicate that leaves increase reverberation at 4 kHz by 0. 08 sec. The results on sound transmission over the low barrier with green roof systems suggest that SPL attenuation increases with the increasing green roof areas. The extra SPL (sound pressure level) attenuation caused by green roof systems could be up to 9. 5 dB at certain frequencies. With well-planned application of landscape designs in a courtyard, speech levels and RT at 500 Hz are decreased by 9. 3 dBA and 81 %, respectively. In outdoor spaces of apartment complexes, RT is generally rather long, over 4 sec at 500 Hz, influenced by many factors such as openness, source-receiver distance and building height. In terms of SPL distribution, the measured SPL is up to 8 dB higher compared to the <b>semi-free</b> <b>field</b> situation. It is also found that vegetation at the apartment complex can be effective in reducing RT by 0. 95 sec (46 % decrease) ...|$|E
40|$|Out {{of thermal}} {{equilibrium}} state, the vacuum is unstable and evolves in time. Consequently, the annihilation operators {{associated with the}} unstable vacuum depend on time. This dissipative time-evolution of quantum systems can be systematically treated, within the canonical operator formalism referred to as non-equilibrium thermo-field dynamics. Given is an alternative route to derive the time-dependent annihilation operators within the formalism.

40|$|The non-equilibrium thermo-field {{dynamics}} {{proposed by}} Arimitsu and Umezawa are generalized {{to the case}} of a fourth-order unperturbed Hamiltonian which includes not only a second-order (quadratic) part but also a fourth-order part. Fujita’s analysis for effects of the initial particle correlation of a quantum gas is proved generally in terms of TFD. The forms of the quasi-particle operators for a <b>semi-free</b> boson <b>field</b> are derived. It is shown that the energies and life-times of the quasi-particles depend on the adiabatic boson-reservoir interaction which leads to the fourth-order part of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. The form of the two-point Green’s function for the <b>semi-free</b> boson <b>field</b> is evaluated. A form of the admittance for a boson system interacting with its heat reservoir, which includes effects of the initial correlation and memory, is derived using the TCLE method formulated in terms of the generalized non-equilibrium thermo-field dynamics. A calculation method of the higher-order parts of the admittance in powers of the boson-boson interaction is given. Furthermore, a calculation method of the perturbation expansions of the two-point Green’s function for the boson system is given. Subject Index: 13...|$|R
