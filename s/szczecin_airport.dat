Vehicles occasionally operate the Koszalin - Mielno Koszalin route, supported mainly by Class SA103 and Slawno - Darlowo supported mainly by Classes SA109 and SA110. In case of failure of Western Pomeranian Class EN57, Atribo sets replace them on the electrified routes such as Szczecin - Białogard, Szczecin - Gryfino and Szczecin - Kamien Pomorski. Since August 29, 2012 Atribo are also used on the line Szczecin - Piła and since June 2013 also to <b>Szczecin</b> <b>Airport</b> Goleniów (on the route from Szczecin to Kolobrzeg).|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{issue of}} {{measuring}} {{the contribution of}} air transport to the regional economy is very important nowadays since many airport infrastructure projects are being implemented, using available European Union funds. As a result of growing transport needs and increasing incomes among the population, the air transport market is strongly developing.  This development results to many direct and indirect socio-economic benefits to locations in close proximity of an airport {{but also in the}} whole economy. The measurement of these benefits is important because the decisions made with respect to air transport influence local and regional economic performance. The most commonly used tool for measuring the positive effects associated with the operation of an airport is the input-output analysis. The aim of the article is to present the characteristics of the input-output method, to indicate its applications in Poland - the country with the most dynamic growth of air transport, to present the possible limitations of this method and propose improvements. 	Methods: The method used in this research is one that measures the effects of changes in the economy as a result of air transport activity. Particular input-output analysis is used. 	Results: On the background of the results of modeling the impact of polish airport on regional economy in 2009 the updated analysis in 2012 is provided. The economic impacts of Krakow, Katowice, Wroclaw and <b>Szczecin</b> <b>airports</b> are estimated. Then the limitations of input-output method are presented and suggestions of possible improvements are made. 	Comments: Proper measurement of the impact of airport&# 39;s operation and investment on the economy, leads to more effective air transport policy development. For future research, the advanced input-output method to assess the positive impact of airports on regional development is recommended. However, a comprehensive assessment of the operation and expansion of airport infrastructure requires comparing the economic benefits with economic costs...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the fall}} of {{communism}} transport in Poland has improved significantly. There is acceptable tourist infrastructure, especially in larger cities and in major tourist resorts. Most major Polish cities (e.g. Kraków, Wrocław, Poznań, Gdańsk and <b>Szczecin)</b> have international <b>airports</b> with connecting services with the Frédéric Chopin International Airport in Warsaw. Intercity travel supports the PKP Intercity, Przewozy Regionalne, local trains (Koleje Dolnośląskie, Koleje Śląskie, Koleje Małopolskie, Arriva RP, Szybka Kolej Miejska (Tricity), Pomorska Kolej Metropolitalna, Koleje Mazowieckie, Łódzka Kolej Aglomeracyjna, Koleje Wielkopolskie, [...] ) and PKS's, PolskiBus and many smaller companies. There are also coach connections to other countries provided by various companies (inter alia Eurolines). Connections by ferry to Sweden and Denmark through the Baltic Sea are for example from Gdańsk, Gdynia and Świnoujście (inter alia Polferries).|$|R
