Until January 2007 the combined test was offered to all pregnant women in a designated geographical area as a pilot study before the introduction of the national screening program in the Netherlands, to test the logistic procedures. In January 2007 the insurance companies suddenly stopped paying for the combined test with respect to women aged 35 years by decision of the government. In 2006 the combined test was performed in 4616 women compared with 3459 who had the combined test in 2007, a reduction of 25 % (95 % CI 23. 8 - 26. 3 %, p < 0. 001). A decline was observed in the uptake of the combined test in women aged 35 years (p < 0. 001) as opposed to an increase in uptake in women aged 36 years (p < 0. 001).

25|$|The {{importance}} {{of how a}} woman perceives her behavior <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>underestimated.</b> Many women perceived sex as a chore {{as opposed to a}} pleasurable experience, and they tend to consider themselves sexually inadequate, which in turn does not motivate them to engage in sexual activity. Several factors influence a women's perception of her sexual life. These can include: race, her gender, ethnicity, educational background, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, financial resources, culture, and religion. Cultural differences are also present in how women view menopause and its impact on health, self-image, and sexuality. A study has found that African American women are the most optimistic about menopausal life; Caucasian women are the most anxious, Asian women are the most inhibited about their symptoms, and Hispanic women are the most stoic.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{volume of}} {{head and neck}} squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients can lead to longer intervals between histopathological diagnosis and primary treatment. This could cause psychological distress to the patient, but more importantly could possibly lead to tumor progression and decreased survival. Accordingly, this study investigates these relationships. The correlation of professional delay and clinical characteristics of 2493 patients, treated between 1990 and 2011 with oral, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and laryngeal SCC, was investigated. Patients were divided in two groups based on treatment delay, defined as the interval between histopathological diagnosis and initial treatment. Univariate and multivariate proportional hazards models {{were used to assess}} disease specific survival (DSS) and disease free survival (DFS). Year of diagnosis, tumor site and therapy were significantly related to treatment delay. Tumor stage <b>was</b> <b>not</b> related to treatment delay. Multivariate regression models revealed that the group with a delay of more than 30 days had a better DSS (HR. 838, CI. 697 -. 922, p=. 041) and DFS (HR. 816, CI. 702 -. 947), p=. 007) than the group treated within 30 days. In our study, treatment delay up to 90 days <b>is</b> <b>not</b> related to impaired survival. This argument can be used extremely cautiously to comfort patients who have to wait several weeks for treatment. Although, possible tumor progression during treatment delay could have led to increased morbidity subsequent to more extensive treatment.

The first was a non-aggression treaty between the local Christian powers (who were also free from Ottoman servitude), meaning that the disasters of Andronikos III's later rule would not be repeated. Next were a treaty between Byzantium and the successor of Bayezid, Süleyman who was in Asia Minor, confirming Byzantium's freedom from paying tribute.

40|$|Background: Plans are {{underway}} to introduce Chlamydia screening in UK primary care. The {{success of a}} screening programme depends upon many factors including its acceptability to the population being screened. The experiences {{of women who have}} taken part in a pilot study of screening are therefore important in ensuring that services are developed in such a way to maximise health benefits. Objectives: To explore the experiences of Chlamydia screening among women with both positive and negative results and women who were still waiting for results; to reflect on the implications of their views for primary care based screening programmes. Methods: Interviews were camed out with twenty women who had participated in a pilot of opportunistic Chlamydia screening camed out in eight general practices in Edinburgh. Four participants had received a positive result, 14 had a negative result and two were still waiting for results. Qualitative analysis was camed out on interview transcripts using the framework approach. Results: Most women saw themselves as at low risk of Chlamydia infection because: it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> perceived as a common infection (many had never heard of it before); they felt that their sexual history did not put them at risk; or because they had no symptoms (although Chlamydia is frequently asymptomatic). Women inter-viewed welcomed the offer of Chlamydia screening because of the importance of preventing infertility, the ease of testing, and the knowledge that the infection could easily be treated with antibiotics. However, women stressed {{that it was important to}} receive adequate information in order to make an informed choice about whether or not to accept the test. Conclusions: The complexity of messages to be conveyed when offering a Chlamydia screening test, for instance regarding the symptomless nature of the infection and the implications of a positive result, mean that the time taken to communicate this adequately <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>underestimate...</b>|$|R

Within this context the combination and the coexistence of the theistic and deistic image of God is striking, as well as the import of the deistic representation of death of the transition and of the faith in the immortality of the soul.

The radiologist also possesses the knowledge and competence to ensure compliance with all aspects of radiation protection and justification of investigations which is particularly relevant regarding CT.

They attacked both British reinforcements on their way to the front and the retreating British forces with machine-gun fire and bombs. The morale of the British soldiers suffered considerably as a result of these attacks.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the influence of employee and organizational factors, such as learning and working climate, on the retention of talented employees. Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire was administered to 972 employees. Explorative factor analysis was performed to reduce the number of variables and to look for underlying constructs in the data. Secondly, using multiple stepwise regression analysis the influence of the factors on retention was examined. Thirdly, ANOVA’s were calculated to compare retention in different kinds of groups of employees. Findings – Retention was reflected by two factors, namely ‘intention to stay’ and ‘intention to leave’. Results showed the significant influence of learning and working climate on worker’s intention to stay. The learning and working climate also had an influence on the intention to leave, although less substantive. Other predictors of intention to stay were age, leadership skills, learning attitude and creativity, and the use of procedures within the organisation. In order to predict the intention to leave, learning attitude and creativity were excluded from the regression model. ANOVA’s only revealed differences for ‘high potentials’ and seniority regarding the intention to stay. Originality/value – This research has shown that learning and working climate has a significant influence on employee’s intention to stay and in a lesser amount on intention to leave.
