Ngaraba <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> started in 1996 and provides preschool education to approximately 60 children per year. The <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> is private and is run by three teachers. The <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> provides education to 3 - 6 years olds from Matokeo, Kanuni, Azimio and Jitegemee Sub-Wards. Parents of children attending/attended Ngaraba <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> participated in a survey to collect community members' feelings and opinions about the <b>Nursery</b> <b>School.</b> Results of the survey reveal that the status and learning environment of the <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> is poor. The <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> cannot maintain the required standards due to inadequate capital. The fees rate per month is TZS 3000. A monthly collection is not enough to pay for salaries and other operational fees and savings. The low level of the <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> does not provide ground for raising the fee rate. The Community {{would like to see the}} status and learning environment of Ngaraba <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> improved. Successful completion of this project is anticipated to improve the status and learning environment of Ngaraba <b>Nursery</b> <b>School.</b> With improved learning environment the <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> can raise the fees rate and hence collect enough money to cater for the costs of maintaining the required high preschool standards.
