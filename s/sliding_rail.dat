5000|$|In early 1916 Sergeant Foster of 11 Squadron RFC {{improved}} the French hinged mounting {{for the upper}} wing Lewis gun on a Nieuport 11 or 16, by replacing the awkward double hinge of the French mount with a quadrant shaped <b>sliding</b> <b>rail.</b> The <b>sliding</b> <b>rail</b> became the feature of all later [...] "Foster" [...] mountings, and enabled the breech of the gun to swing back and down in one movement, bringing the breech conveniently {{in front of the}} pilot, and making it much easier to change ammunition drums or to clear stoppages.|$|E
5000|$|Roads are {{primarily}} designed for their main users, cars, and are seldom engineered with motorcycle specific safety in focus. The choice of roadside barriers and guardrails to prevent vehicles from crossing over a median or running {{off the road}} {{have proved to be}} dangerous for motorcyclists, as they are designed to dissipate braking energy for much heavier and structurally tougher cars and trucks. Moreover, they are designed to be impacted on the <b>sliding</b> <b>rail</b> and not at their support poles, which act as swords to unprotected road users.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Slide</b> <b>rails</b> {{are usually}} {{fabricated}} by roll forming {{and are used}} in kitchenware and cabinets mostly. However the product weight of <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> is increased because larger dimensions are required to bear larger load when they are used in dies and warehouses. International suppliers start to develop Aluminum <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> to decrease the product weight in recent years. The manufacturing and functional feasibility of Aluminum <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> were discussed in this study. The Aluminum <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> was designed according to ready-made <b>slide</b> <b>rail,</b> and the aluminum alloy was selected with required mechanical properties. The suitable extrusion die was designed and direct extrusion parameters of extrusion ratio, extrusion temperature, extrusion speed and extrusion load are also considered. The extrusion process of aluminum alloy was simulated by CAE software to check the mold and process design. The extrusion part of aluminum <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> {{was carried out by}} extruder to verify the simulation results...|$|R

5000|$|Piston airguns, {{often called}} [...] "springers", are unique in many ways. Since the firing process {{involves}} a fairly massive piston suddenly moving to compress the air, {{they have a}} significant [...] "kick", generally called [...] "recoil" [...] (though {{this is not the}} same as firearm recoil). The recoil begins when the piston starts to move forwards, which pushes the rest of the gun backwards. Then recoil then stops suddenly as the piston reaches the end of its travel, and is brought to a stop by the cushion of high-pressure air trapped between the piston and pellet. This recoil can be brutal on the gun in high-powered models, and will loosen screws, shift sights, and break scopes not designed specifically for the unique recoil of piston airgun - all of these can lead to poor accuracy. In addition to the recoil, piston airguns have a long lock time, as the piston must compress the air before the pellet begins to move, and the gun is moving due to the recoil during this time. Spring airguns require a special technique to fire, to ensure that the gun moves very consistently during this recoil. The preferred method is a very loose hold, to allow the gun to move back; this means that a piston airgun will not shoot the same from a bench. All accuracy testing and sighting in must be done in the same position the gun will be shot from, otherwise the results will be different. [...] Piston airgun recoil cannot readily be dealt with without a significant redesign; in some cases the action can be mounted on a <b>sliding</b> <b>rail,</b> or two counter-recoiling pistons can be used, but this requires significant changes to the design. The resulting gun will be far less sensitive to the shooter's hold, and thus much easier to shoot accurately.|$|E
30|$|The fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing {{technology}} {{was used to}} monitor the situation of a crevice of the continuous beam joint and rails near rail expansion devices on a viaduct of the urban railway. The monitoring items consisted of the rail temperature, rail displacement, viaduct beam displacement, and strain of <b>sliding</b> <b>rail</b> in the rail expansion device section. The strain sensor was a prefabricate FBG strain gauge, the displacement sensor with different scales used an FBG stress ring, and the FBG of the temperature sensor was pre-drawn and fixed in a metal tube. Compensation sensors were used to balance environmental temperature changes. All FBGs were suspended adhered, therefore the chirped phenomenon of the FBG reflection peak was avoided, and the measurement accuracy was improved. The monitoring results matched to the manual test and theoretical estimation.|$|E
40|$|Though getting astronauts safely {{into orbit}} and beyond {{has long been}} one of NASA?s chief goals, their safe return has always been equally as important. The Crew Exploration Vehicle?s (CEV) Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) is {{designed}} to safely return astronauts to Earth on the next-generation manned spacecraft Orion. As one means for validating this system?s requirements and testing its functionality, a test article known as the Parachute Compartment Drop Test Vehicle (PC-DTV) will carry a fully-loaded yet truncated CPAS Parachute Compartment (PC) {{in a series of}} drop tests. Two aerodynamic profiles for the PC-DTV currently exist, though both share the same interior structure, and both have an Orion-representative weight of 20, 800 lbf. Two extraction methods have been developed as well. The first (Cradle Monorail System 2 - CMS 2) uses a <b>sliding</b> <b>rail</b> technique to release the PC-DTV midair, and the second (Modified DTV Sled; MDS) features a much less constrained separation method though slightly more complex. The decision as to which aerodynamic profile and extraction method to use is still not finalized. Additional CFD and stress analysis must be undertaken {{in order to determine the}} more desirable options, though at present the "boat tail" profile and the CMS 2 extraction method seem to be the favored options in their respective categories. Fabrication of the PC-DTV and the selected extraction sled is set to begin in early October 2010 with an anticipated first drop test in mid-March 2011...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper details an experimental-numerical approach for the quantitative correlation between wear and end-point deflection in a <b>slide</b> <b>rail.</b> Focusing the attention on <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> utilized in white-goods applications, the aim is to evaluate the number of cycles the <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> can operate, under different load conditions, before it should be replaced due to unacceptable end-point deflection. In this paper, two formulations are utilized to describe the wear: Archard model for the linear wear and Lemaitre damage model for the non- linear wear. The linear wear gradually reduces the surface of the <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> whereas the non- linear one accounts for the surface element deletion (i. e. due to pitting). To determine the constants to use in the wear models, simple tension test and sliding wear test, by utilizing a designed and developed experiment machine, have been carried out. A full <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> model simulation has been implemented in ABAQUS including both linear and non-linear wear models and the results have been compared with those of the real rails under different load condition, provided by the rail manufacturer. The comparison between numerically estimated and real rail results proved the reliability of the developed numerical model, limiting the error in a ± 10 % range. The proposed approach allows predicting the displacement vs cycle curves, parametrized for different loads and, based on a chosen failure criterion, to predict the lifetime of the rail...|$|R

30|$|The arm can rotate {{and move}} a gripper, {{attached}} to the robot base, along the vertical axis. The rotation of the gripper occurs around the vertical axis. We adopt a multi-step vertical movement mechanism. Fig.  4 a shows {{an overview of the}} multi-step up–down mechanism. By connecting the five-step <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> with the chains and the sprockets, all of the <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> are driven relative to the movement of the top rail. The rotary motion of the servo motor is transformed to linear motion by the ball screw allowing the top <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> to move {{up and down in the}} vertical direction. This mechanism is based on the extension mechanism of a ladder truck. Fig.  4 b, c show the installation of the multi-step up–down mechanism in the actual process. When the vertical component is contracted, all parts are held above the worker, which prevents collisions with the worker and ensures the worker’s safety.|$|R
50|$|The first railway {{switches}} {{were in fact}} wagon turnplates or <b>sliding</b> <b>rails.</b> Turnplates {{were initially}} made of two or four pieces of wood, circular in form, that replicated the track running through them. Their diameter matched that of the wagons used on any given wagonway, and they swung around a central pivot. Loaded wagons could be moved onto the turnplate, and rotating the turnplate 90 degrees allowed the loaded wagon to be moved to another piece of wagonway. Thus, wagon weight was limited only by {{the strength of the}} wood used in the turnplates or <b>sliding</b> <b>rails.</b> When iron and later steel replaced stone and wood, weight capacity rose again.|$|R
50|$|Grendel Inc., {{founded by}} George Kellgren, was a Florida {{firearms}} company which produced polymer framed semi-automatic pistols from 1987 to 1994.

It is also commonly referred to as freeskiing, jibbing, as well as many other names around the world.|$|R
40|$|A {{device for}} {{enabling}} a wheelchair user {{to enter and}} exit the wheelchair includes a stabilizing frame. The stabilizing frame has two <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> to which a base plate is movingly attached. An electric motor drives a leadscrew, causing the base plate to move along the <b>slide</b> <b>rails.</b> A telescopic column is vertically mounted onto the base plate. The seat assembly, including handlebars and a seat platform, is rotationally attached {{to the top of}} the telescopic column. The telescopic column is extended and collapsed by a linear actuator, raising and lowering the seat assembly. A stationary non-rotational rod is vertically mounted onto the telescopic column. When a user sitting on the seat platform exerts a moment force on the stationary rod, the seat assembly rotates about the stationary rod. A locking mechanism prevents the seat assembly from rotating when the user is transferring to or from the seat platform...|$|R

5000|$|While <b>sliding</b> a <b>rail</b> {{the skier}} jumps and turns 180 degrees so {{they end up}} <b>sliding</b> the <b>rail</b> in the {{opposite}} direction. Also called 'swap'. Swaps can be done 'frontside' or 'backside/blindside'. As well, skiers can switch-up more than 180 degrees; for example, a '360-switch-up'/'3-swap' involves the skier jumping on a rail feature, spinning 360 degrees, and landing again on the rail.|$|R
50|$|In 1983 {{production}} of the classic models was largely ceased {{in favor of a}} new series of pistols taking most of their features from the Charles Petter SACM style of pistols (also seen in the SIG P210 and CZ-75.

5000|$|However, the {{problems}} with turnplates and <b>sliding</b> <b>rails</b> were twofold. First, they were relatively small (often no more than [...] in length), which limited the wagon length that could be turned. Second, their switching capacity could only be accessed when the wagon {{was on top of}} them and still, which limited the total capacity of any wagonway. The railway switch, which overcame both of these problems, was patented by Charles Fox in 1832.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{introduces}} the structure, working principle, simple calculation and main {{application of the}} linear motion unit. Foreword Modern manufacturing technology is developing towards high speed, precision and modularization. In microelectronics field, the traditional feed system is mainly "rotating servo motor + ball screw" drive mode, which can achieve the highest feed speed of 90 - 120 m/min, with the maximum acceleration only of 1. 5 g. [1] Along with progress of science and technology, linear motion unit of modular design has emerged. Linear motion unit is widely used in modern industry. This is {{a new type of}} mechanical part. It integrated the traditional mechanical drive mechanism and guide mechanism in one and reserves the interface of drive device. This enables the whole mechanical mechanism to be more compact, the drive to be more smoothly and the movement precision to be higher.
