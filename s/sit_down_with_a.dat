500|$|The lyrics for Wasting Light were {{completed}} {{during the week}} each song was being recorded. Grohl said that the words were [...] "what was on my mind each week", most being [...] "written {{from the perspective of}} who I was then and who I am now", with references to the past, life and death, and [...] "time, but questioning whether it matters at all. There's so much focus on the before that people forget there's an after." [...] The frontman said this was helped by the environment - [...] "a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to the way we used to make records" [...] - and working with Vig again, which [...] "made me think a lot about starting over, and rebirth, and making your way through tragedy and coming out the other side." [...] An example was [...] "I Should Have Known", partially inspired by former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain - [...] "a song like 'I Should Have Known' is about all the people I've lost, not just Kurt". Grohl still tried to do laid-back songs such as [...] "White Limo", which had its lyrics written in just two minutes, specially after Mendel sent him an e-mail saying, [...] "I really like it when you write songs that are silly and mean nothing, too. You don't have to try to write 'Imagine' every time you <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pen and paper".|$|E
2500|$|After {{they had}} signed to Virgin Records, the Kooks were {{reluctant}} to record an album straight away, stating a desire {{to focus more on}} their live performances and songwriting. The band has said embarking on their first live tour instead of recording an album initially helped them develop their style and sound. As Pritchard claimed, [...] "We didn’t <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> blueprint. We just naturally developed and we didn’t try to shape or mould ourselves to anything." [...] As a result, they went into the studio with hundreds of songs from a variety of genres, and it took an [...] "incredible amount of patience" [...] from producer Tony Hoffer to shape the content into what would become the record.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{schools on}} all {{education}} levels offer service-learning programs, which {{allow students to}} serve the community through volunteering while earning educational credit. According to Alexander Astin in the foreword to Where's the Learning in Service-Learning? by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, Jr.,"...we promote more wide-spread adoption of service-learning in higher education because {{we see it as}} a powerful means of preparing students to become more caring and responsible parents and citizens and of helping colleges and universities to make good on their pledge to 'serve society.'" [...] When describing service learning, the Medical Education at Harvard says, [...] "Service learning unites academic study and volunteer community service in mutually reinforcing ways. ...service learning is characterized by a relationship of partnership: the student learns from the service agency and from the community and, in return, gives energy, intelligence, commitment, time and skills to address human and community needs." [...] Volunteering in service learning seems to have the result of engaging both mind and heart, thus providing a more powerful learning experience; according to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, it succeeds {{by the fact that it}} [...] "...fosters student development by capturing student interest..." [...] While not recognized by everyone as a legitimate approach, research on the efficacy of service learning has grown. Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles conducted a national study of American college students to ascertain the significance of service learning programs, According to Eyler and Giles,"These surveys, conducted before and after a semester of community service, examine the impact of service-learning on students." [...] They describe their experience with students involved in service-learning in this way: [...] "Students like service-learning. When we <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> group of students to discuss service-learning experiences, their enthusiasm is unmistakable. ...it is clear that believe that what they gain from service-learning differs qualitatively from what they often derive from more traditional instruction." ...|$|E

60|$|And {{yet there}} had been variety in his life--at the times he changed from one job to another, or was taken sick. When he was six, he was little mother and father to Will and the other {{children}} still younger. At seven {{he went into the}} mills--winding bobbins. When he was eight, he got work in another mill. His new job was marvellously easy. All {{he had to do was}} to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little stick in his hand and guide a stream of cloth that flowed past him. This stream of cloth came out of the maw of a machine, passed over a hot roller, and went on its way elsewhere. But he sat always in one place, beyond the reach of daylight, a gas-jet flaring over him, himself part of the mechanism.|$|E
