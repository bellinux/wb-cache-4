25|$|The {{settlements}} at Economy remained economically successful {{until the}} late 19th century, producing many goods in their cotton and woolen factories, sawmill, tannery, and from their vineyards and distillery. They also produced high quality silk for garments. Rapp's granddaughter, Gertrude, began the silk production in Economy {{on a small scale}} from 1826 to 1828, and later expanded. This was planned in New Harmony, but fulfilled when they arrived at Economy. The Harmonists were industrious and utilized the latest technologies of the day in their factories. Because the group chose to adopt celibacy and their members grew older, more work gradually had to be hired out. As their membership declined, they stopped manufacturing operations, other than what they needed for themselves, and began to invest in other ventures such as the oil business, coal mining, timber, railroads, land development, and banking. The group invested {{in the construction of the}} Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, established the Economy <b>Savings</b> <b>Institution</b> and the Economy Brick Works, and operated the Economy Oil Company, as well as the Economy Planing Mill, Economy Lumber Company, and eventually donated some land in Beaver Falls for the construction of Geneva College.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the retail}} banking sector of several countries, com-mercial banks coexist with {{organizations}} such as <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> characterized by relatively weak governance structures. Although <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> with a weak governance may face disadvantages when they compete with commercial banks, our analysis suggests that a weak governance {{may lead to a}} relevant strategic advantage as well: due to e¤ects mediated through the 8 ̆ 5 nancial structure, a weak governance may alter the very strategic nature of the mode in which <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> compete in the marketplace, and when this occurs they are able to capture a greater market share of bank deposits, issue more bonds and become more pro 8 ̆ 5 table than com-mercial rivals...|$|R
50|$|Contractual <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> (also called {{institutional}} investors) give individuals {{the opportunity}} to invest in collective investment vehicles (CIV) as a fiduciary rather than a principal role. Collective investment vehicles pool resources from individuals and firms into various financial instruments including equity, debt, and derivatives. Note that the individual holds equity in the CIV itself rather what the CIV invests in specifically. The two most popular examples of contractual <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> are pension funds and mutual funds.|$|R

40|$|Contractual <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> - {{pension funds}} and life {{insurance}} companies - have long been important institutions in several developing countries. But, with notable exceptions, they have been weak and underdeveloped. Some of this is attributable to low levels of income in developing countries {{and some of it}} to the negative impact of repressive regulations and the existence of pay-as-you-go social security systems. The author briefly reviews the size of contractual <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> in selected developed and developing countries and assesses their {{role in the development of}} the financial sector - especially in the development of securities markets. He stresses five points : 1) the structure of a country's financial system depends on the organization of the country's pension system; 2) contractual savings do not increase the rate of saving but shift the composition of total savings toward long-term financial assets; 3) the role of contractual <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> in securities markets reflects historical traditions and differences in regulation; 4) investment regulations mustaim at ensuring the safety and profitability of contractual savings; encouraging investment prudence and developing effective supervision should be basic objectives of public policy; and 5) contractual <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> can have a great impact on securities markets.

40|$|Contractual <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> include {{national}} provident funds, {{life insurance}} companies, private pension funds, and funded social pension insurance systems. They have long-term liabilities and stable cash flows {{and are therefore}} ideal providers of term finance, not only to government and industry, but also to municipal authorities and the housing sector. Except for Singapore, Malaysia, {{and a few other}} countries, most developing countries have small and insignificant contractual savings industries that have been undermined by high inflation and inhibited by oppressive regulations and pay-as-you-go social pension insurance systems. Contractual <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> play a much bigger role in the financial systems of developed countries. In some countries, such as Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, the resources mobilized by life insurance companies and pension funds correspond to well over 100 percent of annual GDP. The authors provide an overview of the structure and the state of development of contractual <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> in both high- and low-income countries. They also identify a number of operating characteristics that define the social, economic, financial and regulatory implications of different types of contractual <b>savings</b> <b>institutions.</b> The authors emphasize the fundamental objectives for reforming the contractual savings and pension systems.

40|$|This study {{examined}} strategies for effective saving mobilization in Calabar agricultural zone of Cross River state. It specifically sought to identify the, strategies for mobilizing savings, factors influencing savings mobilization and constraints to savings mobilization. The study used a purposive sampling technique to select 20 <b>saving</b> <b>institutions</b> in 3 LGAs out of 7 {{that were in}} the study area. Data were obtained from primary source using structured questionnaires and analysed through the use of descriptive statistics measures such as frequency counts, percentages and tables as well as inferential statistics such as multiple regression analysis [...] The result of the analysis showed that the most common saving strategy used by formal institution were advert and promotion (36. 1 %) and the most common for informal were group sensitization and minimum amount required to open an account were used to mobilize savings. Instruments like agric. saving scheme and children’s education were used by both formal an informal <b>saving</b> <b>institution</b> to mobilize <b>savings.</b> Four variables were significant for determinant of savings mobilized, and these were, age of the institution (10 %), minimum amount required to open an account (10 %), value of institution asset (10 %) and number of savers (5 %). Illiteracy and lack of trust on <b>saving</b> <b>institutions</b> were the major constraints in mobilizing <b>savings.</b> Therefore, <b>savings</b> <b>institutions</b> should improve on their services so as to attract more savers...|$|R
