5|$|On the {{one hand}} there are very many people who, if they read any poetry at all, try to take all its {{statements}} seriously – and find them silly... This may <b>seem</b> <b>an</b> absurd mistake but, alas! it is none the less common. On the other hand {{there are those who}} succeed too well, who swallow 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty...,' as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as the expression of a certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness {{as a result of their}} linguistic naivety.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of Antón de Alaminos on the expedition is, in effect, {{one of the}} arguments against the hypothesis that the objective was exclusively one of slaving. This prestigious pilot, veteran of the voyages of Columbus and even, according to some, a man knowledgeable of places not published on the mariners' maps, would <b>seem</b> <b>an</b> excessive resource for a slaving expedition to the Guanajes islets.|$|E
25|$|Members of the American Reform {{movement}} began {{a program}} to convert to Judaism the non-Jewish spouses of its intermarried members and non-Jews who {{have an interest in}} Judaism. Their rationale is that so many Jews were lost during the Holocaust that newcomers must be sought out and welcomed. This approach has been repudiated by Orthodox and Conservative Jews as unrealistic and posing a danger. They say that these efforts make Judaism <b>seem</b> <b>an</b> easy religion to join and observe when in reality being Jewish involves many difficulties and sacrifices.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the United States began a {{transition}} from use of whale oil to petroleum for heating and lighting. Discovery of oil fields in western Pennsylvania in the late 1850s and the promise of increased industrial activity and economic growth after the end of the American Civil War combined to make the refining of crude oil <b>seem</b> <b>an</b> attractive business to Rockefeller. He and Flagler enlisted chemist Samuel Andrews and with his brother, William Rockefeller, Jabez Bostwick, and Flagler's relative and silent partner, Stephen V. Harkness, went into the refining business in Cleveland as Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler.|$|E
25|$|By the 1890s, {{several new}} factors were drawing the Australian colonies towards {{political}} union. The great land boom in Victoria in the 1880s {{was followed by}} a prolonged depression, which allowed New South Wales to recover the economic and demographic superiority it had lost in the 1850s. There was a steady rise in imperial sentiment in the 1880s and '90s, which made the creation of united Australian dominion <b>seem</b> <b>an</b> important imperial project. The intrusion of other colonial powers such as France and Germany into the south-west Pacific area made colonial defence an urgent question, which became more urgent with the rise of Japan as an expansionist power. Finally the issue of Chinese and other non-European immigration made federation of the colonies an important issue, with advocates of a White Australia policy arguing the necessity of a national immigration policy.|$|E

500|$|The Fiery Trial won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for History, the Bancroft Prize, and the Lincoln Prize. The New York Times Book Review listed The Fiery Trial {{as one of}} its 100 Notable Books of 2010, writing, [...] "Foner tackles {{what would}} <b>seem</b> <b>an</b> obvious topic, Lincoln and slavery, and sheds new light on it." ...|$|E
500|$|The race {{returned}} to Italy, after also passing through Switzerland, in another long stage. The one climb {{of the day}} occurred a little over [...] into the stage, the Passo Maloja. The entire stage to that point was on {{a slight increase in}} elevation, while the finish was on a long and drastic descent into Chiavenna. Its profile made it <b>seem</b> <b>an</b> inviting stage for breakaway attempts.|$|E
500|$|... "City Girl" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "mid-tempo, with an unusual repeating melody and a two-note chorus.

[...] Rolling Stone noted that the song—and other tracks Shields contributed to the Lost in Translation soundtrack—feature [...] "My Bloody Valentines ethereal sensibility, but they are more fragile in their construction, without Shields' furious sheets of guitar." ...|$|E

500|$|The first trailer was {{launched}} on August 27, 2013. The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, on which Deadline's Pete Hammond said, [...] "It would <b>seem</b> <b>an</b> absolute no-brainer that both (McConaughey and Leto) will be sitting {{front and center}} come March 2nd at the Dolby Theatre when Oscar winners are announced. If there are two better performances by anyone this year I have not seen them." [...] Focus Features released the film on November 1, 2013.|$|E
500|$|Many {{reviewer}}s {{commented that}} the dark tone of the final episode {{was typical of the}} series. A reviewer for BBC Comedy said that it [...] "was a characteristically dark end to a show which was never afraid to explore the flip side of the comedy coin." [...] UKTV Gold's website says [...] "it was a suitably downbeat end to an equally downbeat man." [...] Commenting that killing off the protagonist [...] "might <b>seem</b> <b>an</b> odd way for a sitcom to end," [...] the British Film Institute's ScreenOnline says that in a series [...] "where comedy and tragedy are so intertwined, it seems entirely appropriate." ...|$|E
500|$|At Demme's {{personal}} recommendation, Pfeiffer {{joined the}} cast of Stephen Frears's Dangerous Liaisons (1988) alongside Glenn Close and John Malkovich, playing the virtuous victim of seduction, Madame Marie de Tourvel. Her performance won her widespread acclaim; Hal Hinson of The Washington Post saw Pfeiffer's role as [...] "the least obvious and the most difficult. Nothing is harder to play than virtue, and Pfeiffer is smart enough not to try. Instead, she embodies it. Her porcelain-skinned beauty, in this regard, is a great asset, and the way it's used makes it <b>seem</b> <b>an</b> aspect of her spirituality". She won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.|$|E

500|$|Stockhausen's two early Electronic Studies (especially the second) had a {{powerful}} influence on the subsequent development of electronic music in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly {{in the work of}} the Italian Franco Evangelisti and the Poles Andrzej Dobrowolski and Włodzimierz Kotoński [...] The influence of his Kontra-Punkte, Zeitmasse and Gruppen may be seen in the work of many composers, including Igor Stravinsky's Threni (1957–58) and Movements for piano and orchestra (1958–59) and other works up to the Variations: Aldous Huxley In Memoriam (1963–64), whose rhythms [...] "are likely to have been inspired, at least in part, by certain passages from Stockhausen's Gruppen" [...] Though music of Stockhausen's generation may <b>seem</b> <b>an</b> unlikely influence, Stravinsky said in a 1957 conversation: I have all around me the spectacle of composers who, after their generation has had its decade of influence and fashion, seal themselves off from further development and from the next generation (as I say this, exceptions come to mind, Krenek, for instance). Of course, it requires greater effort to learn from one's juniors, and their manners are not invariably good. But when you are seventy-five and your generation has overlapped with four younger ones, it behooves you not to decide in advance [...] "how far composers can go," [...] but to try to discover whatever new thing it is makes the new generation new.|$|E

2500|$|The {{recording}} {{conducted by}} Richard Bonynge (with Sherrill Milnes as Hamlet and Joan Sutherland as Ophelia) includes the ballet music in its proper {{place at the}} beginning of act 4, but omits significant portions of it. Edward Greenfield, in his review of the recording in the Gramophone magazine says the ballet music [...] "may in principle <b>seem</b> <b>an</b> absurd intrusion in this of all operas, but … in effect provides a delightful preparation for Ophelia's mad scene".|$|E
2500|$|This {{collection}} {{is almost the}} antithesis of Cántico. [...] The continued optimism and delight in life that the poet had shown despite the upheavals in his personal life and the turmoil of world events must have begun to <b>seem</b> <b>an</b> inadequate response. [...] So there are poems such as [...] "Los intranquilos" [...] which use much simpler, less distanced language and {{convey a sense of}} unease, dissatisfaction, uncertainty. [...] In this poem, the only escape from all this is into the oblivion offered by drink or the television.|$|E
