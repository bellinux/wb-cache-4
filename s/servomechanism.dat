25|$|Electromechanical {{regulators}} called voltage stabilizers or tap-changers, {{have also}} been used to regulate the voltage on AC power distribution lines. These regulators operate by using a <b>servomechanism</b> to select the appropriate tap on an autotransformer with multiple taps, or by moving the wiper on a continuously variable auto transfomer. If the output voltage {{is not in the}} acceptable range, the <b>servomechanism</b> switches the tap, changing the turns ratio of the transformer, to move the secondary voltage into the acceptable region. The controls provide a dead band wherein the controller will not act, preventing the controller from constantly adjusting the voltage ("hunting") as it varies by an acceptably small amount.|$|E

25|$|A {{servomotor}} is a motor, {{very often}} {{sold as a}} complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly control valves, such as motor-operated control valves. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended {{for use in a}} <b>servomechanism</b> must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the <b>servomechanism</b> loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{radar signal}} was locked on target and its data was {{wirelessly}} transmitted to a ground receiver that {{was connected to}} the artillery <b>servomechanism</b> feedback control system, causing the servo to accurately modify its angular position and maintain it for an optimum amount of time, long enough to fire at the calculated (predicted) coordinates of the target and thus successfully track the target.|$|E

50|$|A {{servo drive}} {{is a special}} {{electronic}} amplifier used to power electric <b>servomechanisms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term {{correctly}} {{applies only}} to systems where the feedback or error-correction signals help control mechanical position, speed or other parameters. For example, an automotive power window control is not a <b>servomechanism,</b> {{as there is no}} automatic feedback that controls position—the operator does this by observation. By contrast a car's cruise control uses closed-loop feedback, which classifies it as a <b>servomechanism.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{servomotor}} is {{a specific}} type of motor that is combined with a rotary encoder or a potentiometer to form a <b>servomechanism.</b> This assembly may in turn form part of another <b>servomechanism.</b> A potentiometer provides a simple analog signal to indicate position, while an encoder provides position and usually speed feedback, which by the use of a PID controller allow more precise control of position and thus faster achievement of a stable position (for a given motor power). Potentiometers are subject to drift when the temperature changes whereas encoders are more stable and accurate.|$|E
50|$|As the {{electronics}} revolution took off, single-signal channel circuit design became redundant, and instead radios provided proportionally coded signal streams which a <b>servomechanism</b> could interpret, using pulse-position modulation (PPM).|$|E
50|$|<b>Servomechanisms</b> are {{commonly}} position or speed control devices that use feedback. Understanding {{of these devices}} is covered in control theory. Control theory was successfully applied to steering ships in the 1890s, but after meeting with personnel resistance it was not widely implemented for that application until after the First World War. <b>Servomechanisms</b> are extremely important in providing automatic stability control for airplanes and {{in a wide variety}} of industrial applications.|$|R
