40|$|The conzequence {{low income}} of the farmer {{household}} in agricultural sector is the increase in their activities as miner of sand and stone. It means for increasing of their household income. However, how important mining role on the increasing of household income has to be studied in deeply. The factual problem is the base for research aims, with the spesific stress on studying socio-economic characteristic of sand and <b>stone</b> <b>miner,</b> and {{the contribution of the}} mining income to household income. This research was carried out in Progo catchment area, Yogyakarta Special Region. Survey method was employed by data collecting from respondents. The respondents are head of households (HH) working as sand and <b>stone</b> <b>miner.</b> Sampling technique was proportionally simple random sampling in which 120 HH was taken as respondents sample. They were representatives of upper part, middle part, and lower part of Progo catchments area. Data on socio-economic structure of the household and household income were collected by mean of structured interview. Data analysis was performed through descriptive technique in which frequencies and cross tabulation varians statistic, and multiple regression analysis were mostly used. The research shows that there are relatively similarities on socio-economic characteristic of sand and <b>stone</b> <b>miners,</b> between at lower part, middle part with upper part of Progo catchments area. This existing of sand and stone mining employs about 70 % labours are local miners and 30 % labours came from out of the area. Landless farmers who land own less than 500 m 2 characterize them. The most of them are male, withlow formal education, and as small family (4 people evey HH). Some of them have been as sand and <b>stone</b> <b>miners</b> for more than 4 years. Generally, they work less than 8 hours for mining every day. This research is also finding that the {{income of the}} sand and <b>stone</b> <b>miners</b> are seasonal. The averages of mining income on dry season (Rp 571, 880 per month) are higher than on wet season (Rp 365, 620 per month). The most important factor affecting income in this activity is the working hours spent. In average, the miner’s monthly income is Rp 468, 760 is much higher than minimum level of basic need in Yogyakarta Special Region (Rp 328, 750 per month). It means that sand and <b>stone</b> <b>miner</b> as a second occupation besides as a farmer increases household income be capable to satisfy the need of household economy. In general, it can be concluded that the activity has an important role on the increasing of household income...|$|R

The result showed that the public explanation of sand and <b>stone</b> <b>miners</b> into their backgrounds to work as miners because of sand and stone to make ends meet despite the work of mining the high risks such as landslides, flash floods, accidents resulting in death and environmental destruction occurs.

40|$|Unrecognized {{roof beam}} {{failures}} resulted in 69 % {{of the falls}} of ground injuries occurring in underground U. S. stone mines from 1990 to 1996. Field investigations at 45 underground stone mines suggest that excessive beam sag or deflection is the principal unstable roof behavior characteristics associated with miner injuries. Laminated roof structures, common in most underground stone mines, allow the immediate roof to separate into distinct beams. The timely determination of roof beam deflection could provide <b>stone</b> <b>miners</b> with advanced knowledge of potentially hazardous roof. Existing methods to assess roof conditions consist of observational and monitoring techniques. Observational techniques include open drillholes, sounding, wedging, and borescopes. Monitoring techniques include scratch tools, extensometers, telltales, Miners Helpers, and Guardian Angels'. Miners have difficulty utilizing these techniques because roof beams are located an average of 8 m (26. 5 ft) above the miner's head in environments that are dark, dusty and noisy and these deflections are measured in millimeters of movement. To help mitigate the potential for falls of ground injuries to underground <b>stone</b> <b>miners,</b> the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has developed the Roof Monitoring Safety System (RMSS) to aid in monitoring dangerous levels of roof beam deflection. If enough site-specific information is collected and placed on highly visible maps, individual mining operations could establish general guidelines for responding to specific roof beam deflection occurrences. This would help in implementing a pro-active, comprehensive roof control plan for reducing falls of ground injuries...|$|R

40|$|The {{correlation}} of northwest (NW) Pacific climate anomalies during summer with El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{in the preceding}} winter strengthens in the mid- 1970 s and remains high. This study investigates {{the hypothesis that the}} tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) response to ENSO is key to this interdecadal change, using a 21 -member ensemble simulation with the Community Atmosphere Model, version 3 (CAM 3) forced by the observed history of sea surface temperature (SST) for 1950 – 2000. In the model hindcast, the TIO influence on the summer NW Pacific strengthens in the mid- 1970 s, and the strengthened TIO teleconnection coincides with an intensification of summer SST variability over the TIO. This result is corroborated by the fact the model’s skills in simulating NW Pacific climate anomalies during summer increase after the 1970 <b>s</b> <b>shift.</b> During late spring to early summer, El Niño–induced TIO warming decays rapidly for the epoch prior to the 1970 <b>s</b> <b>shift</b> but grows and persists through summer for the epoch occurring after it. This difference {{in the evolution of the}} TIO warming determines the strength of the TIO teleconnection to the NW Pacific in the subsequent summer. An antisymmetric wind pattern develops in spring across the equator over the TIO, and the associated northeasterly anomalies aid the summer warming over the north Indian Ocean by opposing the prevailing southwest monsoon. In the model, this antisymmetric spring wind pattern is well developed after but absent before the 1970 <b>s</b> <b>shift.</b> 1...|$|R

However, whether the charge trapping mainly occurs at the nc-SiSi O 2 interface or in the nc-Si is still unclear. In this work, by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy analysis of the Si 2 p peaks, the concentrations of both the nc-Si and the Si suboxides that exist at the nc-SiSi O 2 interface are determined as a function of thermal annealing, and the charging effect is also measured by monitoring the shift of the surface C 1 s peak. It is observed that the annealing-caused reduction of the total concentration of the interfacial suboxides is much faster than that of both the C 1 <b>s</b> <b>shift</b> and the nc-Si concentration. In addition, the trend of the C 1 <b>s</b> <b>shift</b> coincides with that of the nc-Si concentration.
