50|$|The 125.6 m ship is {{the biggest}} in the Nigerian Navy. She is a {{multi-purpose}} frigate with capabilities for anti-air, anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare effectively, and participated in the 200th anniversary celebrations of the Battle of Trafalgar. The ship also possesses capability for naval fire support and electronic warfare. Additionally, she carries a <b>ship-borne</b> <b>helicopter</b> for anti-submarine warfare, search and rescue, and enhanced surveillance/detection.|$|E
50|$|However, Liu Huaqingâ€™s plan {{proved to}} be too ambitious as the {{domestic}} Chinese industry at the time could not meet the goal demanded by the plan. As a result, the plan was drastically scaled back to basic research level and the date for an aircraft carrier entering PLAN service was postponed and eventually put on hold. In the meantime, pilot candidates for warship captain training was also altered, with candidates switched to <b>ship-borne</b> <b>helicopter</b> pilots, because it was considered that naval helicopter pilots with much more ship-borne aviation experience would be better prepared than the land-based jet fighter pilots who lack ship-borne aviation experience.|$|E
5000|$|The RNoAF {{will conduct}} several {{investments}} in the coming years. First the European helicopter NH-90 will be introduced to replace the Lynx helicopters as a <b>ship-borne</b> <b>helicopter,</b> the Air Force also have bought an additional 16 Search and rescue Augusta-Westland AW101 helicopters to replace its aging Sea King helicopters. The aging F-16AM fighter will be replaced from 2016. On 20 November 2008, {{the prime minister of}} Norway Jens Stoltenberg announced that the F-35A was the only fighter fulfilling all the Norwegian requirements and thus the preferred choice [...] Stoltenberg stated that cooperation with the Nordic countries on defence and security would continue independently of the F-35 purchase.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the loss of the role of anti-shipping aerial torpedo in modern naval doctrine, true torpedo bomber units no longer exist in modern armed forces. The most common {{platform}} for aerial torpedoes today is the <b>ship-borne</b> anti-submarine <b>helicopter,</b> followed by fixed-wing anti-submarine aircraft such as the American P-3 Orion.|$|R
50|$|Search {{and rescue}} squadrons {{received}} new aircraft when the CH-149 Cormorant replaced the CH-113 Labrador beginning in 2002. The CC-115 Buffalo was replaced in the 2000s with the CC-130 Hercules at CFB Trenton and CFB Greenwood, {{but are still}} used on the west coast. <b>Ship-borne</b> anti-submarine <b>helicopter</b> squadrons are currently operating the CH-124 Sea King.|$|R
50|$|The last Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) unit {{left the}} airport in 1952. In the late 1980s the RCAF {{returned}} to the property when 443 Helicopter Squadron began operating CH-124 Sea King <b>ship-borne</b> anti-submarine <b>helicopters</b> from Victoria International Airport. The RCAF refers to 443 Squadron operations at the airport as the Patricia Bay Heliport.|$|R
40|$|In March-April 1991 a {{combined}} expedition using fixed-wing aircraft and <b>ship-borne</b> <b>helicopter</b> {{was carried out}} to estimate harp seal pup production in the Greenland Sea (the West Ice). Photographs {{were taken from the}} fixed-wing aircraft and analysed from counts made on negatives. Visual surveys were made fiom helicopter using funnel-shaped shades to limit the search strip. Three separate breeding patches of harp seals were sweyed by either or both of the methods, making direct comparisons between the methods possible. Abundance estimates calculated from the basic data are given for these patches. Bearing in mind that neither survey covered all known patches, the photographic estimate of surveyed areas was about 40, 000 pups, and the visual estimate of surveyed patches about 60, 000 pups. Both these estimates have an inherent negative bias caused by the fact that known patches were not included (which my account for at least - 10 %); neither have scattered pups between patches nor the temporal distribution of births been taken into consideration. A specific problem of the photographic survey are the errors made during reading and interpretation of the photographs. These aspects were investigated by reading negatives under slightly different conditions, and parallel reading of negatives and printed copies, which apparently have differing properties with respect to readability definitions of harp seal pups. By these two procedures it was demonstrated that counts increased by 3. 2 % and 5. 5 %, respectively. Conclusively, it is recognized that the aerial survey results in general are consistent with pup production estimates based on mark-recapture experiments conducted over the last 15 years...|$|E
25|$|However, {{the ship}} began taking evasive {{measures}} and increased speed to the maximum. This was also when it issued a distress signal, which {{was picked up}} by Malaysian navy support ship KD Sri Indera Sakti about 15 nautical miles away. In rapid response, Captain Mohamad Adib dispatched the <b>ship-borne</b> Fennec <b>helicopter</b> gunship armed with twin general purpose machine guns and an elite Naval Special Forces PASKAL airborne sniper. The Malaysian helicopter was joined by a Eurocopter AS 365 Dauphin helicopter of the Royal Saudi Navy, effectively scaring off the pirates.|$|R
40|$|Good {{visual cues}} are {{necessary}} in flight simulation of ship borne helicopter operations. Operating in a degraded visual environment {{has a negative}} impact on pilot workload and task performance. However, the need for motion cues in piloted flight simulation is still a widely debated issue. This paper describes a preliminary piloted flight simulation study into the effects of visual and motion cues on the operation of <b>ship-borne</b> <b>helicopters</b> and pilot workload. Unsteady CFD airwakes have been computed and integrated into the FLIGHTLAB modelling and simulation environment with a simulated rotorcraft model, configured to be representative of an SH- 60 B helicopter. A series of ship-deck landing and hover manoeuvres have been conducted using the University of Liverpool's HELIFLIGHT-R motion-base flight simulator representing different visual and motion cues, for a range of ship airwakes and sea states (ship deck motions). The usable cue environment (UCE), handling quality and pilot workload ratings were assessed using visual cue ratings (VCR), handling quality rating (HQR) the Bedford workload rating scale and the Deck Interface Pilot Effort Scale (DIPES). This paper presents the results from simulation trials with two test pilots examining the effect of the simulation cueing on task performance and workload. Visual cues were found to have a significant impact both on the usable cue environment ratings and pilot workload ratings. In degraded visual environments, the pilot's ability to make corrections in attitude and translational rates was reduced. Pilot experienced higher workload in terms of compensatory control inputs to complete the same mission task compared to operations in a good visual environment. Analysis of the pilots' workload ratings and control activity shows that motion cueing can cause differences in the perceived pilot workload. For the simulation of ship borne operations, the motion cueing effects are dependent on other simulation conditions, which include visual environments, airwake, sea states and ship deck motion. The effect of motion cueing on pilot workload and control activity was found to be more significant when the visual cueing was degraded. The variation in pilot workload ratings and control activities under different motion and visual cues indicate that the Ship Helicopter Operating Limits (SHOL) can be affected by the simulation cueing fidelity...|$|R
5000|$|Seeking {{to improve}} its ships' anti-submarine capabilities, the RCN pioneered the use of large <b>ship-borne</b> <b>helicopters</b> on small surface ships like destroyers in the rough waters of the North Atlantic and Pacific. The {{recovery}} of helicopters to a wildly pitching flight deck {{was made possible by}} the invention of the [...] "Bear Trap", a cable and winch system which hauled a helicopter, hovering at full power, to the flight deck in all manner of conditions. Using this technology, the St. Laurent-class DDEs were upgraded to destroyer-helicopter (DDH) vessels during the early to mid-1960s to accommodate recently acquired CH-124 Sea King anti-submarine helicopters. Other ships also received upgrades to increase their anti-submarine capabilities. The RCN was also actively involved in the development of various forms of ship-borne sonar, most notably the variable depth sonar (VDS), which greatly increased the ranges at which submarines could be detected. [...] The improved capabilities conferred by these innovations contributed to Canada's NATO allies giving the RCN an expanded anti-submarine role in the North Atlantic. Much of the RCN's experimental work in these fields was conducted in conjunction with the Defence Research Board, and it would later include experiments leading {{to the development of the}} fastest warship ever built, the 60 kn [...] The RCN also expanded and improved its aviation capabilities during much of this period. While it had provided crews for the British aircraft carriers [...] and [...] during the Second World War, and Canadians had served in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm, Canada had no carriers of its own until HMCS Warrior entered Canadian service in 1946. Warrior proved unsuitable for North Atlantic winters, however, and was replaced by HMCS Magnificent in 1948. By the mid-1950s, Magnificent was no longer used as an active aircraft carrier, but was used as a vehicle transport during Canada's peacekeeping response to the 1956 Suez Crisis, before being paid off. Her replacement, , was a more modern aircraft carrier which had been substantially rebuilt to accommodate an angled flight deck and other improvements. During this time, the RCN also used stations at HMCS Shearwater and [...] to operate carrier-based fighter and anti-submarine aircraft, including the British Supermarine Seafire and Hawker Sea Fury, and the American F2H Banshee, the RCN's only jet fighter. Anti-submarine aircraft included variants of the Fairey Firefly, the Grumman Avenger, and a version of the Grumman Tracker built by de Havilland Canada.|$|R
