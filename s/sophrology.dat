50|$|<b>Sophrology</b> is {{well-established}} in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and South America. In 2005 a <b>sophrology</b> centre {{was set up}} in Geneva and London {{to bring}} <b>sophrology</b> to the English-speaking world.|$|E
50|$|From 1988 to present, Professor Caycedo {{continues}} {{to develop and}} improve the <b>sophrology</b> method in Andorra. In 1989, he created the new level of Master of Caycedian <b>Sophrology</b> and founded the International University of Caycedian <b>Sophrology</b> (Sophrocay International).|$|E
50|$|He {{noticed that}} many people were wary of the term {{hypnosis}} as it {{is often associated with}} something mysterious and even magical. For this reason, he coined the term <b>sophrology</b> in October 1960 and the same year he founded the first department of clinical <b>sophrology</b> at Madrid University. At this time, <b>sophrology</b> is in fact very close to hypnosis, although <b>sophrology</b> advocated a more humanist approach to the patient.|$|E
50|$|On {{his return}} to Spain, Professor Caycedo settled in Barcelona where he started {{expanding}} <b>Sophrology.</b> He initiated a <b>Sophrology</b> group work in Paris and spread the word at scientific conferences in Spain, Switzerland and Belgium.|$|E
50|$|Following this success, <b>Sophrology</b> grew rapidly {{throughout}} the French-speaking world. Although initially used only in medicine, <b>Sophrology</b> then opened to other areas: sports of course but also prevention {{and promotion of}} health in the corporate world, in education, in arts, etc. Dr Abrezol ran training programmes for {{a large number of}} influential doctors and sports coaches, many of whom now run Training Centres throughout France. His enthusiasm and his success with athletes opened doors for <b>Sophrology</b> to be taught in many areas of life.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sophrology,</b> {{coming from}} Ancient Greek [...] / [...] ("harmony"), [...] / [...] ("mind"), and [...] / [...] ("study/science"), <b>Sophrology</b> {{is the study}} of the {{consciousness}} in harmony; a healthcare philosophy made of very practical physical and mental exercises aiming at a prepared mind in a focused body.|$|E

50|$|In Switzerland, Dr Raymond Abrezol {{discovered}} the unique benefits of <b>Sophrology</b> {{and brought it}} {{to the attention of the}} general public. In 1965, having just finished his <b>Sophrology</b> studies, he tried to help a friend with whom he was playing tennis regularly. His performances and concentration developed quite dramatically. Abrezol then helped another friend with his skiing performance.|$|E
50|$|During {{his stay}} in Colombia in 1985, Caycedo created the fourth Level of Dynamic Relaxation and the “social” branch of <b>Sophrology.</b> In 1988 {{he moved to}} Andorra and created the notion of « Caycedian <b>Sophrology</b> ». In 1992 he started the {{following}} levels and created a master's degree. In 2001, the twelve levels of Dynamic Relaxation with their specific techniques were completed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sophrology</b> can be practised solo or in a group, with no {{need for}} special equipment.|$|E
5000|$|... 1973 European Symposium in Lausanne, Brussels and {{the first}} {{collective}} <b>sophrology</b> training takes place in Paris ...|$|E
50|$|From 1982 to 1988, Caycedo created <b>sophrology</b> in Bogotá. It was {{presented}} in 1985 at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in the Charcot amphitheatre.|$|E
50|$|Alfonso Caycedo {{looked into}} {{phenomenology}} after working in 1963-64 with the Swiss psychiatrist Binswanger (1881-1966) {{who had studied}} with Husserl and Heidegger. Phenomenology had {{a big impact on}} <b>Sophrology.</b> Some of the techniques in <b>Sophrology</b> suggest to look at things “as if for the first time”, with a neutral approach, listening to sensations with no judgement or expectations. Experiencing is key. Suggestion is left to a minimum to let each person experience the exercise in their own ways.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sophrology</b> {{is now a}} {{very common}} method use in France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Belgium and is {{becoming}} increasingly {{well known in the}} UK.|$|E
50|$|Professor Caycedo (of Spanish Basque origin, born in Bogota, Colombia in 1932), neuropsychiatrist, created 12 <b>Sophrology</b> {{degrees in}} 1960 while {{practicing}} medicine {{at a hospital}} in Madrid, Spain.|$|E
5000|$|... 1970 first World Congress of <b>Sophrology</b> in Barcelona with 1400 {{specialists and}} 42 {{countries}} represented. The future king of Spain, Juan Carlos {{is the president}} of honour along with the future queen, Sofia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sophrology</b> {{is about}} better {{understanding}} the body, about knowing oneself better, knowing one’s limits and accepting oneself, feeling fully alive {{here and now}} and living in good health in harmony between body and mind.|$|E
50|$|Alfonso Caycedo (born 19 November 1932 in Bogota, Colombia) {{is one of}} {{the founders}} of sophrology.Professor Caycedo is the head of Sophrocay International, and is based in Andorra, Barcelona and Bogotá, where he teaches the upper levels of <b>sophrology</b> training.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sophrology</b> {{concentrates}} not on {{the problem}} itself but on the positive elements in the person’s life and in their past, present or future that {{will enable them to}} move forward, to feel stronger. The assumption is that positive thoughts start a positive chain reaction.|$|E
5000|$|... « Through an {{everyday}} practice, <b>sophrology</b> aims at harmony in human beings: quite a feat! In practice, {{it does not}} mean seeing life through pink-tinted glasses but putting an end to an unrealistic or negative vision of life to see things as they are (as much as possible) and reinforce whatever positive we have in us. » ...|$|E
50|$|Alfonso Caycedo met Ludwig Binswanger, the Swiss {{founder of}} phenomenological psychiatry, in 1963. Caycedo became {{familiar}} with the method of investigation of the consciousness proposed by Husserl and Heidegger and this definitively influenced {{the direction of his}} research on the consciousness. Caycedo tried to democratise existential phenomenology through <b>sophrology.</b> He proposed to rediscover phenomena of modified states of consciousness with a phenomenology-inspired approach.|$|E
5000|$|This {{method was}} {{developed}} by Professor Alfonso Caycedo, a Colombian Neuro-Psychiatrist, in 1960’s along his personal and professional journey.He presented in 1970 at the first International <b>Sophrology</b> Conference {{as an attempt to}} study scientifically the human consciousness, both a philosophy and a way of life as well as a therapy and a personal development technique.” He later said: [...] "Sophrology is learning to live".|$|E
50|$|It is a {{structured}} method, based on combination of {{techniques such as}} concentration, deep breathing, relaxation, visualisation and simple movements called Dynamic Relaxation. <b>Sophrology</b> considers the person as a whole, body and mind. The exercises used are simple {{and easy to use}} in an everyday life environment. The aim is to learn the techniques that are best suited to the person so that they can use them and adapt them in their everyday life.|$|E
50|$|From then on, <b>Sophrology</b> {{started to}} move away from {{clinical}} hypnosis and concentrated more on body work and the presence of the body in the mind. His idea was to help the Western mind use Eastern methods in a simple way, leaving aside the philosophy and religion, not mimicking those techniques for which he has always had the utmost respect but to enable people to experience easily new ways of working on their levels of consciousness.|$|E
50|$|A {{dramatic}} improvement there again. In 1967, a national ski coach, having heard about it, asked his help to train four ski champions for the Grenoble Olympic Games of 1968, all in great secret. Three of them {{ended up on}} the podium with Olympic medals. They were the only Swiss champions to get medals at the Games that year. The athletes revealed their <b>Sophrology</b> training to the press. The press was ecstatic and Abrezol ended up training the whole national team from the next season.|$|E
50|$|From Jacobson, he mainly {{kept the}} idea of {{differential}} relaxation: use only the minimum muscle tension necessary to do something {{as well as the}} ability to reduce anxiety by relaxing muscular tension. No suggestion or psychotherapy, just muscular relaxation for mental peace. With Schultz, which is a more “mental” method, he was inspired by our ability to get relaxed by imagining it, by visualising it. In October 1960, he created the word “Sophrology” and opened the first department of clinical <b>Sophrology</b> in the Santa Isabel Hospital in Madrid.|$|E
50|$|Gubel {{came from}} Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina. He worked with Milton H. Erickson in the United States and co-founded in Buenos Aires, {{in order to}} spread Erickson′s hypnotherapy in his own country, the Sociedad Argentina de Hipnoterapia (“Argentine Society of Hypnotherapy”). He was also in contact with Alfonso Caycedo and founded the Sociedad Argentina de Sofrología y Medicina Psicosomática (SASMEP) (“Argentine Society of <b>Sophrology</b> and Psychosomatics”). In 1959, he founded the Revista Latino-Americana de Hipnosis Clínica; {{he also was a}} {{correspondent}} editor of the American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis and of the British Journal of Medical Hypnotism. In these magazines and others, he published numerous specialized articles in English and Spanish. He researched and gave lectures in Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela, among other places. He is regarded as “one of the greatest exponents of global hypnotherapy” (“uno dei massimi esponenti della ipnoterapia mondiale”) as well as a “failed psychiatrist” (“malogrado psiquiatra”).|$|E
40|$|This report {{focuses on}} one case study {{organisation}} and their offering of <b>sophrology</b> to support employees {{during a period}} of significant change. Research was conducted in the head office of a FTSE 100 international financial services group who {{is in the process of}} closing its London operation and making redundancies over a two year period. The organisation has been mindful of its responsibilities towards its employees and offered a number of employee well-being initiatives alongside more traditional outplacement services. The support for well-being included <b>sophrology</b> sessions for a small number of staff. Research was conducted by Dr Samantha Evans of Kent Business School to assess the value and use to employees of the <b>sophrology</b> sessions on offer...|$|E
30|$|Introduction One {{of major}} {{determinants}} of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) success is its tolerance. Numerous strategies have been assessed to improve this tolerance, such as pharmacological sedation or <b>sophrology.</b> Music therapy has been showed {{to be effective}} in healthcare settings, in particular in ICU invasively ventilated subjects [1]. We therefore investigated the effect of a musical session provided by a trained caregiver on NIV tolerance and efficacy in ICU patients with acute respiratory failure.|$|E
40|$|Aim: Few stress markers are {{available}} for women in perinatal period. We introduced biopyrrin (BPn) for monitoring the perinatal stress and investigated how the stress could be regulated. Methods: Study patients consisted of 220 full-term pregnant women between 2006 and 2008. Cases were analyzed based on 1) pattern of delivery, the use of pain control (anesthesia) or hypnotics (<b>Sophrology),</b> 2) maternal complications, and 3) habitual smoking or alcohol consumption. Urinary samples were collected from pregnant women before and after delivery, and from newborn babies. Results: The average level of BPn in pregnant women was 2. 61 ± 0. 25 U/g·Creatinin (Cre). (Mean ± SE). This is significantly higher than age-matched non-pregnant women (0. 79 ± 0. 24 U/g·Cre). After normal delivery, BPn was significantly elevated to 5. 29 ± 0. 57 U/g·Cre (p < 0. 001). BPn decreased significantly to 3. 41 ± 0. 51 U/g·Cre in <b>sophrology</b> assisted delivery and 4. 87 ± 0. 53 U/g·Cre under epidural anesthesia (p < 0. 05), while delivery induction elevated BPn (11. 62 ± 1. 95 U/g·Cre). Conclusions: BPn might be an excellent indicator for monitoring perinatal stress. Significant decrease of BPn in sophrology-assisted delivery suggests that the technique should be useful for the relief of perinatal stress...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{the manager}} within the company is not a long quiet river, purpose rather a {{turbulent}} river in which the manager must have the capacity for adaptation to live in harmony the permanent change or the only certainty {{that we can have}} is that the company will continue to change, especially with the digital transformation and artificial intelligence.

40|$|THREE {{considerations}} {{have led}} me to describe this treatment of addiction to alcohol and other drugs, which is now used in prisons and elsewhere. There are variations of it in different coun-tries, and different names are given to it, such as Autogenic Training, Autohypnosis, <b>Sophrology</b> and others. Over a period of 30 years I have visited {{a large number of}} prisons as a consultant psychiatrist. This was generally to assess the mental state of men awaiting trial and would be either {{at the request of the}} man’s lawyer or of the Home Office. Since the early 1960 ’s, I have noticed that drink has played an ever increasing part in the causation of crime, especially violent crime. This {{led me to}} a study of the socio-economic causes of alcoholism and also to carry out a research project over a number of years with the aim of the subject gaining control over his behaviour through conditioning and hypnosis, as will be described later...|$|E
40|$|Childbirth {{ranks among}} the most intense {{experiences}} of acute pain. Neuraxial analgesia (i. e. epidural or combined spinal-epidural technique) {{is the most effective}} way to relieve that pain but it is contraindicated or impossible to perform for some parturients. We designed a survey of the current use of analgesic alternatives to epidural analgesia (EA) for labor pain, specifically the use of opioid patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA), in the French part of Belgium (Wallonia and Brussels). A questionnaire was mailed to the departmental chair of the hospitals with an obstetric unit, both in university and non-university centers (total of 53 centers). The questionnaire evaluated the availability of EA, the alternatives used when EA was contraindicated, the use of opioid-based PCIA for labor analgesia as well as opioid preference and doses, and finally the reasons for not using opioid PCIA. The response rate was 67. 5 % (36 centers). Among the responding hospitals, EA was available for 68 % (range 25 - 85 %) of labors and deliveries. When EA was not available or contraindicated, a parenteral opioid (piritramide, tramadol or pethidine) was proposed in 19 % (7 / 36) of the centers, Entonox in 11 % (4 / 36), a pudendal block by obstetricians in 28 % (10 / 36) and non-pharmacologic alternatives (i. e. hypnosis, <b>sophrology,</b> baths and massages) in 19 % (7 / 36). In 28 % (10 / 36) of the centers however, no analgesic alternative was proposed. Opioid PCIA was employed in 36 % (13 / 36) of the centers and for an additional 11 % (4 / 36) only in case of intrauterine death. Remifentanil was the first choice (76. 5 % of the PCIA), followed by sufentanil (23. 5 %). Other opioids (piritramide, morphine, fentanyl) and ketamine were also administered by PCIA. Forty-five percents of the centers reported never using opioid PCIA by either lack of knowledge (7 %), fear of maternal or fetal side effects (48 %) and unability to provide a correct supervision of the parturient during PCIA use (48 %), opposition from the pediatricians or obstetricians (17 %) or because they considered the technique as ineffective to relieve labor pain (17 %). In conclusion, the survey demonstrated that, when EA is contraindicated, systemic opioid administered by PCIA is used in almost half of the centers (47 %) and that remifentanil is the first choice, particularly when a live birth is expected...|$|E
