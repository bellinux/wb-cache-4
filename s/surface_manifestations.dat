50|$|Because {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the homosexual population remains hidden from view, homosexuality becomes identified in the minds of many with prostitution, disease, and cross-dressing.

It also means that transvestites are subject to hatred, harassment, and police abuse. Police abuse stems not only from popular prejudice but also from the fact that street prostitution is illegal in certain jurisdictions such as Mexico City.

50|$|Internal waves {{can form}} at the {{boundary}} between water layers of different densities. These sub-surface waves are called internal waves. As {{is the case with}} ocean waves at the air-ocean interface, internal waves possess troughs, crests, wavelength, and period. Internal waves move very slowly because the density difference between the joined media is very small. Internal waves occur in the ocean {{at the base of the}} pycnocline, especially at the bottom edge of a steep thermocline. The wave height of internal waves may be greater than 30 m, causing the pycnocline to undulate slowly through a considerable depth. Their wavelength often exceeds 0.8 km and their periods are typically 5 to 8 minutes. Internal waves are generated by wind energy, tidal energy, and ocean currents. <b>Surface</b> <b>manifestations</b> of internal waves have been photographed from space.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the theory}} of inverse problem, the {{optimization}} of open boundary conditions (OBCs) in a 3 D internal tidal model is investigated with the adjoint method. Fourier coefficients of M 2 internal tide on four open boundaries, which are regarded as OBCs, are inverted simultaneously. During the optimization, the steepest descent method is used to minimize cost function. The reasonability and feasibility of the model are tested by twin experiments (TEs). In TE 1, OBCs on four open boundaries are successfully inverted by using independent point (IP) strategy, suggesting that IP strategy is useful in parameter estimation. Results of TE 2 indicate that the model is effective even by assimilating inaccurate “observations. ” Based on conclusions of TEs, the M 2 internal tide around Hawaii is simulated by assimilating T/P data in practical experiment. The simulated cochart shows good agreement with that obtained from the Oregon State University tidal model and T/P observations. Careful inspection shows that the major difference between simulated results and OSU model results is short-scale fluctuations superposed on coamplitude lines, {{which can be treated}} as the <b>surface</b> <b>manifestation</b> modulated by the internal tide.

5000|$|The western {{portion of}} Lada Terra {{contains}} a large dome-shaped structure about 2000 km across termed, [...] "the Lada Rise," [...] {{which is the}} main highland of the region. It reaches an elevation of about 3 km and is dominated {{by one of the}} most massive corona in the solar system, the Quetzalpetlatl Corona, as well as two massive rift zones surround and partially intersect the rise. [...] The high rises of Venus generally fall into the corona-dominated or rift-dominated categories, but the Lada Rise is unique in that it contains both of these features in relatively equal amounts. [...] In 2007, data retrieved from the Venus Express mission using the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer revealed high emissivity anomalies which is interpreted by many scientists to be a hotspot analogous to the Hawaii hot spot on Earth. This, along with the positive gravity anomaly observed, implies a recently active region. Further evidence is observed in the Boala Corona (which lies inside, and postdates the Quetzalpetlatl Corona), where the grabens formed in the depression of the Corona are interpreted to be <b>surface</b> <b>manifestations</b> of terrestrial dikes. The mantle upwelling associated with hot spot tectonism appears to be the dominant process which formed and evolved the Lada Rise.|$|E

40|$|The city of Christchurch and its {{surrounds}} experienced widespread damage due to soil liquefaction {{induced by}} seismic shaking during the Canterbury earthquake sequence {{that began in}} September 2010 with the Mw 7. 1 Darfield earthquake. Prior {{to the start of}} this sequence, the city had a large network of strong motion stations (SMSs) installed, which were able to record a vast database of strong ground motions. This paper uses this database of strong ground motion recordings, observations of liquefaction manifestation at the ground surface, and data from a recently completed extensive geotechnical site investigation program at each SMS to assess a range of liquefaction evaluation procedures at the four SMSs in the Christchurch Central Business District (CBD). In general, the characteristics of the accelerograms recorded at each SMS correlated well with the liquefaction evaluation procedures, with low liquefaction factors of safety predicted at sites with clear liquefaction identifiers in the ground motions. However, at sites that likely liquefied at depth (as indicated by evaluation procedures and/or inferred from the characteristics of the recorded surface accelerograms), the presence of a non-liquefiable crust layer at many of the SMS locations prevented the <b>manifestation</b> of any <b>surface</b> effects.

40|$|The baryonic Universe {{is mainly}} {{composed}} by plasma and so, magnetism plays a fundamental role. However, magnetism is still poorly known. Equations of magnetic field {{are not yet}} {{taken into account in}} all the equations describing our Universe, and in particular in stellar (and solar) equations. Nevertheless, it is known that the magnetism of the solar interior has a key role. Understanding this role will permit also to understand better our terrestrial climate, as all the interplanetary medium is bathing into this magnetic field. New results from various space and ground-based experiments monitoring the radiative and particle emissions of the Sun, together with their movement in space and their terrestrial impact, have opened a new era in both solar and atmospheric physics. These studies clearly show that the variable solar radiative and particle output affects the Earth’s atmosphere and climate in many fundamental ways. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} emphasize the Sun as a unique object for which we may hope a quantitative approach before generalization to other more energetic objects.
