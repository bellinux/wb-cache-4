40|$|Natural {{cellulosic}} fibres such as flax fibres present interesting {{mechanical properties}} {{as well as}} biodegradability, and by-products, such as <b>short</b> <b>flax</b> <b>fibres,</b> {{could be used to}} produce geotextiles to stabilise soils. Today, geotextiles are often made of coir fibres, which have a high lignin percentage leading to their slow degradation in soil. Fibres with a high cellulosic content, such as those of flax, exhibit lower resistance to soil degradation. This study investigates solutions to improve this parameter with a view to increasing their service life and therefore their credibility compared to coir fibres for geotextile applications. For this purpose, a cellulose coating of yarns made of <b>short</b> <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> was performed and its stability under a water flow was assessed. The ability to form a cellulose sheath was estimated by chromaticity measurements of flax fibres after applying a dye specific to lignin. Infrared spectrometry analysis to monitor the level of protection against degradation by cellulolytic enzymes was also carried out. It appears that the cellulose coating provides an efficient physical protection, preventing access of these enzymes to their fibrous substrate. Then, the possibility of conferring antibacterial properties on the cellulose coating by chelating phytoalexin molecules such as gramine on it was assayed and proven to be effective against soil cellulolytic bacteria such as Cellvibrio fulvus and Cellvibrio vulgaris. This study therefore establishes that coating flax yarns with cellulose associated with antibacterial molecules could contribute to obtaining a longer service life in soil for geotextiles manufactured from flax fibres...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Products from flax {{have the}} highest {{hygroscopic}} and other characteristics affecting {{the health of the}} people. Increased demand for flax products was also promoted by the development of new technologies of industrial processing (for example, cottonisation of the <b>short</b> <b>flax</b> <b>fibres),</b> discovery of new healing properties of flax seeds, etc. More than 90 % of the Latvian products from flax are exported to the countries of Western Europe and America. At the present time for an overwhelming majority of agricultural farms of Latvia more economical is the combine harvesting technology of flax. However, when the yields of the flax are higher than 4. 6 - 5. 0 t/ha and the output of one set of self-propelled machines exceeds 120 ha, the efficiency of the combine and the swath harvesting method is practically the same. Due to the increase in the prices of fuel and electric energy, the borderline between the equal economical efficiency will shift towards lower yields.

In this study, numerical methods to generate and simulate mechanical properties of flax short fibre-reinforced and flax fibre fabric-reinforced polymer composites are proposed. The microstructures of <b>short</b> <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> with different fibre length-to-diameter ratios are generated by algorithm taking fiber defects (e. g. kink band) and fiber bundles into account. Bidirectional flax fabric is generated and discretized by tetrahedron 4 -node finite elements. A brittle material law for fibre defects and interfacial zones of fibre bundles is proposed. Flax short fibre/polypropylene and flax fabric/epoxy composites are modeled by a non-linear plasticity model considering an isotropic hardening law and non-local continuum damage mechanics. The numerical modelling results are {{compared with the}} experimental results of these composites. This study shows that the simulation can capture the main damage mechanisms of the composites such as fibre breakage initiated at the fiber defects, damage of polymer matrix and the fibre debonding at fibre/matrix interface accurately.

The fibrc'matrix interface is modified via chemical modifications as well as modifications in processing parameters (transcrystallinity). Effects of parameters like fibre length, fibre volume fraction and fibre-matrix interface modification on the mechanical properties of long <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced PP composites (compression moulded) as well as <b>short</b> <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> based composites (injection moulded) are studied. In {{order to get a}} better insight in the importance of these different parameters for the optimisation of composite performance, the experimental results are compared with model predictions using micromechanical models for random short-fibre-reinforced composites. For the injection moulded composites, different compounding routes are used and compared. The moisture resistance (pick-up and diffusivity) as well as dimensional stability (swelling) of natural fibre mat reinforced thermoplastics (NMTs), based on different kinds of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> and PPs, are studied.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of the present PhD project were to study the interface in flax/iPP composites, to develop and optimise an appropriate surface treatment for improving the interface in flax/iPP composites, and to assess {{the effect of the}} applied surface treatments on the properties of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> (both physical and chemical). Two surface treatments, acetylation and stearation, were developed and optimised in the present study. The effect of these two surface treatments upon the structure of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> was studied using XRD, SEM, ATR-FTIR, ToF-SIMS, XPS, IGC, DVS and single fibre tensile testing. It was found that the treatments did not significantly change the fibre strength, but they altered the fibre surface characteristics (chemical and physical). The water absorption was also significantly reduced after treatment, especially for green (as-received) flax, as was shown using DVS. In all cases the fibre surfaces were found to be very heterogeneous (from a chemistry point of view). The effect of the treatments and the processing conditions on the interfacial bond was studied using the single fibre fragmentation test, and it was shown that both treatments resulted in a stronger interface. The development of transcrystallinity was also found to produce a stronger interface, along with the use of slower cooling rates. However, an examination of the tensile properties of <b>short</b> <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> composites revealed that acetylation did not significantly change the tensile strength, in comparison with the untreated fibres, probably due to the manufacturing route followed in the present study that resulted in fibre lengths lower than the critical length.

40|$|The {{influence}} of compounding and injection moulding {{on the initial}} variability and morphology of <b>short</b> straw <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> is determined and the mechanical properties for the injection moulded fibre reinforced composites are measured. It is found that {{the composition of the}} straw <b>flax,</b> <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> bundles and woody parts, together with the cutting process strongly affects the initial fibre morphology and its variability. In the initial fibres, small particles as well as long fibres with large width were found. A filter was used to reject the fibres with an aspect ratio below 15 before calculating statistics because these fibres have a negligible contribution to the composite reinforcement. After processing, the initial fibre length and width decrease strongly (− 38 % to − 66 % for length and − 22 % to − 72 % for width). Also, the variability is affected resulting in a standard deviation shifted towards lower fibre lengths and widths (− 55 % for length and − 71 % for width). The improvement of mechanical properties of the flax compound compared to the pure matrix material for the injection-moulded samples is found to be similar to the results for compounds with further processed <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> such as scutched and hackled fibres. An increase of tensile strength by 20 % was found, for stiffness the increase is in the order of 50 – 70 %.

Recently, <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> has been incorporated as a reinforcing material for bicycle racing frame due its economical and ecological advantage. <b>Flax</b> <b>fibres</b> also possess very good damping properties due to its molecular structure (weak Van der Waal force between cellulose and hemicellulose molecule). The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforcement on the general mechanical properties of the composite both in static and dynamic conditions. The test results will be compared with competing 100 % carbon composite frames. The results will also be assessed by numerical simulation. A twoin-one static test set up has been designed. This static test setup can measure both the bracket stiffness and torsional stiffness of bicycle frame. For dynamic testing, a dynamic test set up has been designed, which can measure the damping of the frame. The initial test results have shown that <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> has a positive influence on damping of the racing frame...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a rapidly}} growing demand for more {{environmentally}} sustainable materials in the construction industry. Natural <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymers (FRPs) have potential applications as lightweight skins for utility poles, pedestrian bridge elements, and small wind turbine shafts but the structural behaviour of flax-FRP wrapped foam beams {{has yet to be}} investigated. Six beams with various internal foam density and fibre arrangements were constructed and tested. A control beam was made using one glass-FRP (one layer of longitudinal fibres, one transverse) while the remaining used flax-FRP. A fabrication technique for constructing the tubes was developed and presented here. An arrangement using 5 layers of longitudinal <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> and 3 hoop <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> gives similar strength to the glass-FRP control; 4 longitudinal and 3 hoop <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> is expected to give similar stiffness to the glass-FRP control. Flexural strength and stiffness was found to be proportional to the number of longitudinal layers. Increasing the amount of hoop layers shifted the failure mode from compression to tension controlled. Flax-FRP beams that failed in compression gave slightly more warning and higher deflections than those that failed in tension. The results show that flax-FRP skinned foam beams have potential applications in lightweight construction but further testing under environmental and cyclic loading is recommended before these tubes are used in practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of biocomposites in engineering applications {{is demonstrated by}} using aligned flax fibre/polylactate composites as a materials model system. The failure stress of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> is measured by tensile testing of single fibres and fibre bundles. For both fibre configurations, {{it is found that}} failure stress is decreased by increasing the tested fibre volume. Based on two types of <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> preforms: carded sliver and uniaxial non-crimp fabric, aligned flax fibre/polylactate composites were fabricated with variable fibre content. The volumetric composition and tensile properties of the composite were measured. For composites with a fibre content of 37 % by volume, stiffness is about 20 GPa and failure stress is about 180 MPa. The tensile properties of the composites are analysed with a modified rule of mixtures model, which includes the effect of porosity. The experimental results are well predicted by the model. The back-calculated effective stiffness and failure stress of the <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> are in the ranges 56 - 60 GPa and 515 - 730 MPa, respectively. Finally, model predictions are used to present overall guidelines for the comparisons between tensile performance of <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> composites and traditional fibre composites (exemplified by glass fibre composites). The stiffness per volume, per weight and per cost is compared for these two types of composites. Godkänd; 2008; Bibliografisk uppgift: USB; 20081010 (joffe...|$|R
40|$|Canada {{has been}} {{recognized}} as the largest exporter of flax seed in the world. Currently, very little flax straw is further processed, despite its potential as a value added product, with only about 7 - 10 % of Canadian flax seed producers harvesting residual flax straw rather than burning the straw. A traditional use of flax straw {{has been for the}} production of fibre for the linen industry. Interest in <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> has been rekindled with the impetus to seek out bioproducts that replace non-renewal resources and provide value-added opportunities for agricultural producers. <b>Flax</b> <b>fibre</b> also has a range of potential uses in automotive parts, geotextiles, insulation material, etc. Despite this potential, the Canadian <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> sector remains largely underdeveloped, with fledgling supply chains and lack of investment in the necessary processing capacity. This paper develops a framework for analysing the relational exchanges at different stage of the supply chain to determine if the paucity in investment is the result of prohibitively high exchange costs. A number of distinct stages in the <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> supply chain can be identified: farmers producing flax seed and/or straw; processors who extract the natural fibre from the straw; and manufacturers who use the fibre in their products. The paper develops a framework that draws together insights from Transaction Cost Economics, Agency Theory and Bargaining Theory. The role of institutions in facilitating quality measurement and providing participants with information is also considered. The theoretical framework identifies asset specificity, agency measurement costs, bargaining power and under-developed institutions as key factors {{in the development of the}} <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> sector. From the theoretical framework, a set of propositions is developed that examine the anticipated effect of these factors on vertical coordination in the sector. The theoretical propositions are explored through a series of semi-structured interviews with parties at each stage of the supply chain (producers, fibre processors, final manufacturers), as well as with industry experts. Information from the interviews is used to identify the transaction characteristics and the institutional framework characterizing the <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> sector in Canada. This is analysed through a comparative case study approach with the <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> sector in Europe, and the wool fibre sector in New Zealand as an example of a fully developed and long-standing fibre sector. By also noting the different vertical coordination strategies that are present in these supply chains, a connection is drawn between the presence of certain transaction characteristics and the corresponding cost-minimizing exchange relationships. The case studies are used to investigate the propositions developed from the theoretical framework regarding the impact of transaction characteristics on the optimal vertical coordination strategy and the impediments to development and investment in the sector. The propositions developed in the framework are verified to a great extent by the comparative case study. The uncertainty in the exchange environment regarding the future direction of the <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> industry and the high measurement costs due to the absent quality and grading regime in the Canadian <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> set the two industries apart from each other. Both of these dimensions impact the exchange costs of a transaction and subsequently, the extent to which the parties are closely coordinated. The case studies verify that using a framework to analyze transactions provides additional insights because of the joint consideration of several features of the transaction...|$|R
