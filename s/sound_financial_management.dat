At first, his inexperience showed.

He supported the reorganization of supervisor elections from a citywide ballot to district ballots, which was intended to reduce the influence of money and give neighborhoods {{more control over their}} representatives in city government. He also ran on a culturally liberal platform, opposing government interference in private sexual matters and favoring the legalization of marijuana. Milk's fiery, flamboyant speeches and savvy media skills earned him a significant amount of press during the 1973 election. He earned 16,900votes—sweeping the Castro District and other liberal neighborhoods and coming in 10th place out of 32candidates. Had the elections been reorganized to allow districts to elect their own supervisors, he would have won.|$|E

A legislative framework for public <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> includes {{a vast number of}} legislation and public policies that have a direction bearing on the way in which <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> is dealt with in the different spheres of government. The financial affairs in the local government are guided by various legislative frameworks which regulate <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> in the three spheres of government. The Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA) Act 56 of 2003 in addition provides guidelines for securing <b>sound</b> and sustainable <b>financial</b> <b>management.</b> The need to achieve <b>sound</b> public <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> and assurance of acceptable and transparent levels of financial risk has become paramount. To realize the developmental mandate, the Integrated Development Plan (IDP) and budgeting are seen as the most significant tool towards effective public <b>financial</b> <b>management.</b> Government activities require funds to undertake the planned activities and such funds require special care to safeguard the public funds. This study aimed to assess the budgetary control practices in the Ngwathe Local Municipality. The objectives were realized by means of literature review, questionnaires and participant observations. The results of the interviews with the participants (community) revealed that the public is somehow not interested in local government affairs. It was indicated that they are mostly concerned about the social affairs and the job opportunities. The interviews with the municipality revealed that the budgetary control mechanisms are effective. Budget management is a requirement that covers budget preparation, budget implementation, and budget control. The Municipality established the budget office which serves as a mediator between the municipal council and the departmental managers. A good budget is characterized by participation, comprehensiveness, standards, flexibility, feedback and analyses of cost and revenues. However, the municipality should enhance the culture of community participation in local governance. Master...|$|R
