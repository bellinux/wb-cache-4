25|$|Chevrolet {{engineered}} several modifications for the Z06 to {{best use}} the increased power. Starting {{with the most}} structurally rigid body style, the hardtop or FRC, new components included: uprated FE4 suspension, larger wheels and tires, revised gearing ratios, and functional brake cooling ducts. The Z06 is 38 pounds lighter than a standard C5 hardtop thanks to weight-saving measures such as a titanium exhaust, thinner glass, lighter wheel, non-EMT tires, reduced <b>sound</b> <b>proofing,</b> fixed rear radio aerial, and a lighter battery. Starting with the 2002 model year, the LS6 engine output was increased to 405hp (302kW) due to a larger CFM air intake, stiffer valve springs, lighter sodium filled valves and more aggressive camshaft lift and timing.|$|E
25|$|The NH90 {{featured}} {{an advanced}} composite airframe, designed for ballistic tolerance, {{a high level}} of crashworthiness, lower weight, and 30 per cent greater endurance than a metallic counterpart. The four main rotor blades are also composed of composite materials, increasing fatigue strength and lifespan while providing for greater damage tolerance. The unobstructed main cabin area is entered either by large sliding doors {{on either side of the}} fuselage or via a rear ramp, the cabin is designed to accommodate modular equipment packages to enable the rotorcraft to be rapidly reconfigured, providing for operational flexibility. In a troop-transport capacity, the cabin can accommodate up to 20 fully equipped soldiers, or up to 12 stretchers in a medical evacuation role, some light vehicles may also be transported; the main cabin is equipped with environmental control systems and <b>sound</b> <b>proofing</b> measures to improve passenger conditions.|$|E
25|$|The station {{provides}} crew {{quarters for}} {{each member of}} the expedition's crew, with two 'sleep stations' in the Zvezda and four more installed in Harmony. The American quarters are private, approximately person-sized soundproof booths. The Russian crew quarters include a small window, but provide less ventilation and <b>sound</b> <b>proofing.</b> A crew member can sleep in a crew quarter in a tethered sleeping bag, listen to music, use a laptop, and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the module's walls. The module also provides a reading lamp, a shelf and a desktop. Visiting crews have no allocated sleep module, and attach a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall. It is possible to sleep floating freely through the station, but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into sensitive equipment. It is important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts can wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads.|$|E

2500|$|The Torino Brougham {{continued}} to be Torino's luxury oriented model. This model included Brougham ornamentation, additional trim, full wheel covers, additional <b>sound</b> <b>proofing,</b> and cloth trim.

[...] Motor Trend tested a 1971 Torino Brougham 4-door and stated [...] "The [...] cushioning and support was excellent[...]. the upholstery was magnificent." [...] The GT remained the sporty Torino and included dual colour keyed racing mirrors, GT identification, a non-functional hood scoop, hub caps and trim, rings, chrome trim on the foot pedals, full width taillights with the honeycomb effect, and E70-14 tires (F70-14 on convertibles).|$|E
2500|$|The Bernard 60 was an all wood aircraft. Like the Barnard 190, {{it was a}} {{high wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane. [...] In plan the thick wing was straight tapered with rounded tips. The fuselage was flat sided with a curved underside. [...] The crew's enclosed cabin was {{just ahead of the}} wing leading edge and the [...] long passenger compartment, with twelve seats in all and five windows on each side, was lower down beneath the wings. [...] Despite the rapid build, the accommodation was heated, ventilated and sound-proofed; entry was via a port side door which included the rearmost window. [...] The <b>sound</b> <b>proofing</b> was assisted by silencers on the engines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the <b>sound</b> <b>proof</b> properties of the double layer acryl plates with various packing materials inside. The acryl plates were filled with vacuum pressure ranged from- 20 to- 80 kPa, fumed silica as nano-porous materials, and HCFC (hydrochloro-fluorocarbon) as inert gas. The sound pressure level passed though panels was measured to compare soundproof performance. All other panel showed better performance from 500 - 1000 Hz than air layer panel. For the vacuum layer panel, panel with- 80 kPa showed the best performance among other vacuum layer panel throughout all range of frequency. It is found that the more nano-material filled in panel, the lower <b>sound</b> <b>proof</b> performance. When it comes to panel filled with inert gas, the <b>sound</b> <b>proof</b> performance improved when it has greater pressure of gas...|$|R

The walls of the enclosure is fabricated by combining panels of foam, composite sawdust and grinded glass and an outer plywood with air trapped in-between the composite and plywood.
