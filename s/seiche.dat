25|$|<b>Seiche</b> Warning – Rapid, large {{fluctuations}} in water {{level in the}} Great Lakes (similar to the sloshing in a bath tub) caused by storms or high winds, resulting in both lakeshore flooding and critically low water levels at different times. Issued as a Lakeshore Flood Warning with reference of being a <b>Seiche</b> Warning.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect is}} similar to a storm surge like that caused by hurricanes along ocean coasts, but the <b>seiche</b> effect can cause {{oscillation}} {{back and forth across the}} lake for some time. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel piled up water along the northwestern Lake Ontario shoreline near Toronto, causing extensive flooding, and established a <b>seiche</b> that subsequently caused flooding along the south shore.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the earthquake, a strong <b>seiche</b> (standing wave) swept the shores of Tiberias causing {{additional}} death.|$|E
25|$|Seiches {{are often}} {{imperceptible}} {{to the naked}} eye, and observers in boats on the surface may not notice that a <b>seiche</b> is occurring due to the extremely long wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|Seiches {{can also}} be induced by tsunami, a wave train (series of waves) {{generated}} in {{a body of water}} by a pulsating or abrupt disturbance that vertically displaces the water column. On occasion, tsunamis can produce seiches as a result of local geographic peculiarities. For instance, the tsunami that hit Hawaii in 1946 had a fifteen-minute interval between wave fronts. The natural resonant period of Hilo Bay is about thirty minutes. That meant that every second wave was in phase with the motion of Hilo Bay, creating a <b>seiche</b> in the bay. As a result, Hilo suffered worse damage than any other place in Hawaii, with the tsunami/seiche reaching a height of 26 feet along the Hilo Bayfront, killing 96 people in the city alone. <b>Seiche</b> waves may continue for several days after a tsunami.|$|E
25|$|Among other lakes {{well known}} for their regular seiches is New Zealand's Lake Wakatipu, which varies its surface height at Queenstown by 20 {{centimetres}} in a 27-minute cycle. Seiches can also form in semi-enclosed seas; the North Sea often experiences a lengthwise <b>seiche</b> with {{a period of about}} 36 hours.|$|E
25|$|Loch Ness, {{because of}} its long, {{straight}} shape, is subject to unusual ripples affecting its surface. A <b>seiche</b> is a large oscillation of a lake, caused by water reverting to its natural level after being blown to {{one end of the}} lake (resulting in a standing wave); the Loch Ness oscillation period is 31.5minutes.|$|E
25|$|Seiches {{have been}} {{observed}} in seas such as the Adriatic Sea and the Baltic Sea. This results in the flooding of Venice and St. Petersburg, respectively, as both cities are constructed on former marshland. In St. Petersburg, seiche-induced flooding is common along the Neva River in the autumn. The <b>seiche</b> is driven by a low pressure region in the North Atlantic moving onshore, giving rise to cyclonic lows on the Baltic Sea. The low pressure of the cyclone draws greater-than-normal quantities of water into the virtually land-locked Baltic. As the cyclone continues inland, long, low-frequency <b>seiche</b> waves with wavelengths up to several hundred kilometres are established in the Baltic. When the waves reach the narrow and shallow Neva Bay, they become much higher — ultimately flooding the Neva embankments. Similar phenomena are observed at Venice, resulting in the MOSE Project, a system of 79 mobile barriers {{designed to protect the}} three entrances to the Venetian Lagoon.|$|E
25|$|December 16, 1811, 0815 UTC (2:15a.m.); (M ~7.5) {{epicenter}} {{in northeast}} Arkansas, {{probably on the}} Cottonwood Grove fault; it caused only slight damage to man-made structures, {{mainly because of the}} sparse population in the epicentral area. The future location of Memphis, Tennessee was shaken at Mercalli level nine intensity. A seismic <b>seiche</b> propagated upriver and Little Prairie was destroyed by liquefaction. Local uplifts of the ground and the sight of water waves moving upstream gave observers the impression that the Mississippi River was flowing backwards.|$|E
25|$|The 1950 Chayu-Upper Assam {{earthquake}} {{is known}} to have generated seiches as far away as Norway and southern England. Other earthquakes in the Indian sub-continent known to have generated seiches include the 1803 Kumaon-Barahat, 1819 Allah Bund, 1842 Central Bengal, 1905 Kangra, 1930 Dhubri, 1934 Nepal-Bihar, 2001 Bhuj, 2005 Nias, 2005 Teresa Island earthquakes. The February 27, 2010 Chile earthquake produced a <b>seiche</b> on Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana with a height of around 0.5 feet. The 2010 Sierra El Mayor earthquake produced large seiches that quickly became an internet phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|Paul Hainault, {{a retired}} {{professor}} of mechanical engineering from Michigan Technological University, promoted a theory that began as a student class project. His hypothesis held that Fitzgerald grounded at 9:30a.m. on November 10 on Superior Shoal. This shoal, charted in 1929, is an underwater mountain in the middle of Lake Superior about [...] north of Copper Harbor, Michigan. It has sharp peaks that rise nearly to the lake surface with water depths ranging from , making it a menace to navigation. Discovery of the shoal resulted in a change in recommended shipping routes. A <b>seiche,</b> or standing wave, that occurred during the low-pressure system over Lake Superior on November 10, 1975, caused the lake to rise [...] over the Soo Locks's gates to flood Portage Avenue in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, with [...] of water. Hainault's theory held that this <b>seiche</b> contributed to Fitzgerald shoaling [...] of her hull on Superior Shoal, causing the hull to be punctured mid-body. The hypothesis contended that the wave action continued to damage the hull, until the middle third dropped out like a box, leaving the ship held together by the center deck. The stern section acted as an anchor and caused Fitzgerald to come to a full stop, causing everything to go forward. The ship broke apart on the surface within seconds. Compressed air pressure blew a hole in the starboard bow, which sank 18degrees off course. The rear kept going forward with the engine still running, rolled to port and landed bottom up.|$|E
500|$|Restaurants {{are popular}} in the area known as Le Midi. Oysters come from the Etang de Thau, to be served in the {{restaurants}} of Bouzigues, Meze, and Sète. Mussels are commonly seen here in addition to fish specialties of Sète, Bourride, Tielles and Rouille de <b>seiche.</b> In the Languedoc [...] jambon cru, sometimes known as jambon de montagne is produced. High quality Roquefort comes from the brebis (sheep) on the Larzac plateau. The Les Cévennes area offers mushrooms, chestnuts, berries, honey, lamb, game, sausages, pâtés and goat cheeses. [...] Catalan influence {{can be seen in}} the cuisine here with dishes like brandade made from a purée of dried cod wrapped in mangold leaves. Snails are plentiful and are prepared in a specific Catalan style known as a cargolade. Wild boar can be found in the more mountainous regions of the Midi.|$|E
