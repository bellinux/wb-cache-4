However, the male may <b>stand</b> <b>or</b> crouch over the young, {{sheltering}} but not actually brooding them. Young fledge at 35 to 42 days, and are fed by both parents. They stay with their parents for another six months after fledging.|$|E

The guards finally allowed him to see Anna, and Beauchamp was angered that they had underplayed her critical condition. He stayed with her until he could no longer feel her pulse; then the guards took him to the gallows to be hanged before he died of his stab wounds.|$|E
5|$|When {{service from}} Union Station was inaugurated in 1928, both {{eastbound}} and westbound trains were departing the station almost every hour bound for destinations across the United States. Passengers in the station's expansive waiting room could patronize its news stand, telegraph office, barber shop, shoeshine <b>stand,</b> <b>or</b> its lunch counter and soda fountain. Train schedules were handwritten {{on a large}} blackboard, while station staff announced the arrival and impending departures of the trains by megaphone.|$|E

5|$|The use of Malmö Stadion for concerts has {{increased}} since {{the construction of}} Swedbank Stadion and Malmö FF's departure. Since 2007, several known artists such as Ozzy Osbourne, Elton John, Dolly Parton, The Eagles, Kiss, and Rod Stewart have performed at the stadium. Due to the climate in Sweden {{and the lack of}} a retractable roof at the ground, all of these concerts have been held during the European summer, between June–August. The main stage has been placed either facing the Southern <b>Stand,</b> <b>or</b> along one of the short sides of the stadium. The pitch has been covered up with wooden floorboards during the performances to minimize the damage done to the grass. Many spectators complained about the less than impressive sound quality at both the Elton John and Dolly Parton concerts, citing the stadiums layout as unsuitable for this kind of concert.|$|E
5|$|While in Kuwait, Manning {{was placed}} on suicide watch after her {{behavior}} caused concern. She was moved from Kuwait to the Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, on July 29, 2010, and classified as a maximum custody detainee with Prevention of Injury (POI) status. POI status is one stop short of suicide watch, entailing checks by guards every five minutes. Her lawyer, David Coombs, a former military attorney, said Manning {{was not allowed to}} sleep between 5 am (7 am on weekends) and 8 pm, and was made to <b>stand</b> <b>or</b> sit up if she tried to. She was required to remain visible at all times, including at night, which entailed no access to sheets, no pillow except one built into her mattress, and a blanket designed not to be shredded. Manning complained that she regarded it as pretrial punishment.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with another}} newly formed London club Chelsea, Palace applied {{to join the}} Second Division of the Football League. But {{unfortunately}} for Palace, it was Chelsea that were accepted, and Palace were forced {{to settle for a}} place in the Southern League Second Division. To increase the number of club fixtures, they also joined the mid-week United Counties League. Robson established a team of sixteen professionals, mainly drawn from Middlesbrough. The club's inaugural campaign, which consisted mainly of other clubs' reserve sides alongside Southall, Southern United, St. Leonards United and Grays United was a successful one. Their opening match was against Southampton Reserves, and approximately 3,000 people paid 6d to <b>stand</b> <b>or</b> a shilling to sit. Palace led 3–0 after 30 minutes, before fading and losing 3–4. However, that was the club's only defeat in the league all season, and Palace won the championship and were promoted to the Southern League First Division. The season included a run of seventeen straight victories, one of them being a 9–1 win over Grays United. The crowd attendances for the season were regularly between 2,000 and 3,000 although 4,000 attended the 4–0 defeat of Watford Reserves in March.|$|E

25|$|In art schools {{classrooms}} or studios, {{the model}} usually poses on a raised platform called the model <b>stand</b> <b>or</b> dais. In sculpture studios this platform may be built to rotate {{to allow for}} a 360° view for every artist. Long poses are generally required for painting (hours or days) and sculpture (perhaps days). To aid in resuming a long pose after a break, chalk marks and/or masking tape are often placed on the model stand.|$|E
25|$|Biosafety {{cabinets}} {{are used}} {{on a daily basis}} for hours. Besides protection of user and sample material, the human design factors (ergonomics) of the work become more and more important. This includes reduction of the noise level (for a more convenient working atmosphere), a height adjustable <b>stand</b> <b>or</b> stool (for optimized sitting position), panorama side windows (more light within cabinet), 10°angled front sash (enables better sitting position) as well as strong light sources (better view within cabinet) to improve the working conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{circular}} or polygonal form lent {{itself to}} those buildings within church complexes that perform a function {{in which it}} is desirable for people to <b>stand,</b> <b>or</b> sit around, with a centralised focus, rather than an axial one.

In France the aisled polygonal plan was adapted as the eastern terminal and in Spain the same form is often used as a chapel.|$|E

The National Football League was an exception; the league used pure sudden death in its playoffs beginning in 1940 and in regular season matchups starting in 1974, finally modifying its process for playoffs in 2010 and then regular season games in 2011.|$|E
25|$|It is {{now known}} that the confessions were given only after great {{psychological}} pressure and torture had been applied to the defendants. From the accounts of former OGPU officer Alexander Orlov and others, the methods used to extract the confessions are known: such tortures as repeated beatings, simulated drownings, making prisoners <b>stand</b> <b>or</b> go without sleep for days on end, and threats to arrest and execute the prisoners' families. For example, Kamenev's teenage son {{was arrested and charged}} with terrorism. After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.|$|E

From the long periods of kneeling, his knees were covered with wounds, and wearing knee-marks into the rock floor. His disciple Dosyfey recounts that he saw supernatural light coming from the depths of the cave, shining for two hours onto the opposite side of the church. Dosyfey records that at the sight was terrified and fell to the ground.|$|E
