40|$|Precursors of {{lanthanum}} oxide and of (3 La 2 O 3, 5 Ga 2 O 3, SiO 2) system were first elaborated then thermally decomposed into polycrystalline {{lanthanum oxide}} and langasite La 3 Ga 5 SiO 14. The as prepared lanthanum oxide powder was then hydrated and carbonated to give hydroxicarbonates: thermal decomposition of these complex system La 2 O 3 -X(OH) y(CO 3) z was studied by Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy. Spin coating process applied to these precursors was optimized to elaborate thin films of lanthanum oxicarbonate La 2 O 2 CO 3, lanthanum oxide La 2 O 3 and langasite, <b>on</b> <b>silicium</b> <b>substrates</b> (Si-(001)). Thin films are partly textured. Making use of same spin coating process, multiphase thin films of langasite covered with La 2 O 3 particles were obtained.
