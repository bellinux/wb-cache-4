25|$|Dame Helen Mirren {{dedicated}} her 2006 Best Actress BAFTA {{award for}} her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II {{in the film}} The Queen to Ian Richardson. In her acceptance speech she said that, without his support early in her career, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been so successful, before breaking down and leaving the stage. Other tributes and reminiscences by Richardson's colleagues are offered in a memoir by Sharon Mail, We Could Possibly Comment: Ian Richardson Remembered (2009).|$|E
25|$|When a Caucasian {{surrogate}} mother {{gives birth to}} an African American baby, the couple for who {{she was supposed to}} carry a child for refuses to take the newborn. Rachel is {{caught in the middle of}} the madness as she tries to sort things out, but is afraid that the clinic may be sued, or shut down, by the couple. The clinic's psychologist, Lydia (Alfre Woodard), finds that her job may be in jeopardy because <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done the proper background check on the {{surrogate mother}}. As the mother refuses to tell the truth about the baby's father and as the time gets closer for Child Services to step in and take the child, Marissa offers to adopt. However, the birth father is finally contacted and takes the baby home.|$|E
500|$|Delays in the {{shooting}} schedule pushed filming into the autumn, which required the set decorators to spray-paint the autumn leaves green. The uncooperative weather then took a different turn, plunging from oppressive heat to down near , causing frigid conditions for the famous swimming scene in October. The crew wore warm coats, gloves, and boots. Swayze and Grey stripped down to light summer clothing, to repeatedly dive into the cold water. Despite her character's enjoyment, Grey later described the water as [...] "horrifically" [...] cold, and <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> gone into the lake, except that she was [...] "young and hungry".|$|E
60|$|The {{emotion of}} that brief space, while she stood gazing after the crooked figure of old Roger Chillingworth, threw a dark light on Hester's state of mind, {{revealing}} much that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> otherwise <b>have</b> acknowledged to herself.|$|R
60|$|He put it {{that way}} that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> think he <b>had</b> yielded to an impulse of which his head would disapprove.|$|R
6000|$|And {{then she}} had spoken of her failure in the effort of these years. 'If I had begun better,' <b>she</b> said, 'it <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been so with him.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Chairman of the Conservative Party Caroline Spelman was alleged in June 2008 to {{have paid}} for her nanny out of {{parliamentary}} expenses during her early years in Parliament, between 1997 and 1998—an allegation that became known as [...] "Nannygate". It was ruled that she had inadvertently [...] "misapplied part of [...] parliamentary allowances", but calls for her sacking were rebutted since <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{been aware of the}} rules governing the use or purpose of parliamentary allowances. The committee recommended that Spelman repay £9,600.|$|E
2500|$|Urged {{to do so}} by {{national}} party, the local Conservative Association had already decided that the selection would be made by an open primary, in which non-members would have a vote. On 9 July, the Conservative Party leader David Cameron announced that the party would, for the first time, send a postal ballot paper to every voter instead of holding the selection at an open meeting. Wollaston later said that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> put her name forward had she known that the selection was to be by open primary, ...|$|E
2500|$|At age eight, Crosby {{wrote her}} first poem which {{described}} her condition. She later remarked: [...] "It seemed intended by the blessed providence of God that I should be blind all my life, and I {{thank him for}} the dispensation. If perfect earthly sight were offered me tomorrow I would not accept it. I might not have sung hymns to the praise of God if I had been distracted by the beautiful and interesting things about me." [...] She also once said, [...] "when I get to heaven, the first face that shall ever gladden my sight will be that of my Savior". According to biographer Annie Willis, [...] "had {{it not been for}} her affliction <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> so good an education or have so great an influence, and certainly not so fine a memory".|$|E
6000|$|Over {{and over}} I tried to quiet myself by comforting reflections, saying to myself, for instance, {{that if the}} message which Bertha had sent {{floating}} on the sea to me <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been a good one, she would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> sent it. Feel as <b>she</b> <b>might,</b> <b>she</b> could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been so hard-hearted as to crush the hopes of a man who, like herself, might soon lie in a watery grave. But then, there was that terrible word [...] "but." [...] Looked at in certain lights, {{what could be more}} crushing or heart-breaking than that? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For a time, greatly so. You have erred in supposing him not {{attached}} to her. He loved her, I am persuaded, {{as well as}} it was possible for him to--we <b>have</b> <b>not</b> all, you know, the same tenderness of disposition--and I will not pretend to say that while <b>she</b> lived, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> often <b>have</b> had much to bear, but though his temper injured her, his judgment never did. His value of her was sincere; and, if not permanently, he was truly afflicted by her death." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{were quiet}} men with grave and steady eyes, {{and though they}} ate as if feeding was a serious business, {{and they had no}} time to waste, there was nothing in their {{converse}} that jarred upon the girl. Indeed, she saw one break off in a story whose conclusion <b>she</b> fancied <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> pleased her when a comrade glanced at him deprecatingly. In another ten minutes they filed out again, and Deringham smiled at his daughter. [...] "What do you think of them?" [...] he said.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout her husband's presidency, Kennedy {{made many}} {{official}} visits to other countries, {{on her own}} or with the President – {{more than any of}} the preceding First Ladies. Despite the initial worry that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> [...] "political appeal", she proved popular among international dignitaries. Before the Kennedys' first official visit to France in 1961, a television special was shot in French with the First Lady on the White House lawn. After arriving in the country, she impressed the public with her ability to speak French, as well as her extensive knowledge of French history. At the conclusion of the visit, Time magazine seemed delighted with the First Lady and noted, [...] "There was also that fellow who came with her." [...] Even President Kennedy joked, [...] "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris– and I have enjoyed it!" ...|$|E
60|$|A doubt troubled her whether <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{passed the}} milestone. She {{stopped and looked}} at the sky.|$|E
60|$|Joan {{started to}} cross {{to him when}} Kells strode between them. <b>She</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been there, for all the sign this ominous man gave of her presence. He confronted Roberts {{in the middle of}} the camp-circle, and halted, perhaps a rod distant.|$|E
60|$|Jane Porter, who had overheard, was horrified. If the {{proposition}} {{had come from}} the poor, ignorant sailor, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> possibly <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been so surprised; but that it should come from one who posed as a man of culture and refinement, from a gentleman, she could scarcely credit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Age {{does not}} go by years," [...] said Mrs. Dobbs Broughton. [...] "We all know that. 'His hair was grey, but not with years.' Look here, Conway," [...] and she moved back her tresses from off her temples to show him that there were gray hairs behind. He did not see them; and had they been very visible <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> perhaps <b>have</b> been so ready to exhibit them. [...] "No one can say that length of years has blanched them. I have no secrets from you about my age. One should not be grey before one has reached thirty." ...|$|R
5|$|The film's main {{demographic}} {{is women}} and Latinos. Lopez made her largest Hispanic press tour {{to date in}} Miami in promotion of The Boy Next Door. She hoped that the film would appeal to Hispanic markets, due to featuring two Hispanic leads, which <b>she</b> stated <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been possible if a big studio had produced it. She visited ¡Despierta América! and Nuestra Belleza Latina, shows which air on the Latin American network Univision, the latter of which saw 22% ratings gain with Lopez's appearance. According to Variety, the film received 105,000 posts on Twitter by the day of its release.|$|R
60|$|So the {{difficulty}} was solved, in a way, and Frona talked on about herself, with a successfully feigned girlhood innocence, {{as though she}} did not appreciate the other or understand her ill-concealed yearning for that which <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have,</b> but which was Frona's.|$|E
6000|$|... "Judging by my {{experience}} of women," [...] remarked Bashwood the younger, overhearing him, [...] "I should say she probably tried to drown herself. But that's only guess-work again: it's all guess-work at {{this part of}} her story. You catch me {{at the end of}} my evidence, dad, when you come to Miss Gwilt's proceedings in the spring and summer of the present year. She might, or <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not,</b> <b>have</b> been desperate enough to attempt suicide; and she might, or <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not,</b> <b>have</b> been at the bottom of those inquiries that I made for Mrs. Oldershaw. I dare say you'll see her this morning; and perhaps, if you use your influence, you may be able to make her finish her own story herself." ...|$|E
60|$|With these words, {{after many}} pretty little coquettish doubts and fears, and wishes that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> lost it, Mary {{produced}} {{the letter from}} behind the nicest little muslin tucker possible, {{and handed it to}} Sam, who thereupon kissed it with much gallantry and devotion.|$|E
6000|$|All {{this might}} be true, for she did look as if, {{unexpectedly}} to her, he had crossed some mystic line that she had secretly drawn round her. Yet <b>she</b> <b>might,</b> after all, <b>not</b> <b>have</b> worried; and the real climax was that he himself, at all events, needn't. [...] "You'll never find out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what you mean, Peppy," [...] (the lady's name when unabbreviated was Penelope, but as she never was so named by any one, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>not</b> <b>have</b> had the name at all), [...] "and," [...] {{continued}} Mr Stuart, emphatically, [...] "I would advise you to be reasonable and explain yourself." ...|$|R
5000|$|The novel {{describes}} Fuchsia as [...] "a girl {{of about}} fifteen with long, rather wild black hair. She was gauche in movement {{and in a}} sense ugly of face, but with how small a twist <b>might</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> suddenly <b>have</b> become beautiful. Her sullen mouth was full and rich -- her eyes smoldered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very sorry. It is no example, {{but there}} may be claims from the mere length of the attachment, which seems to mark her as the {{appointed}} instrument for his good. Besides, she has not fully accepted him; and after such change as he has made, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been justified in denying all encouragement.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Holding the floor, {{in order}} that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a chance to protest, I spread an {{alluring}} panorama of peaks and valleys before her eyes, with an eloquence which I intended should overcome every objection. That she was giving way to my appeal was evident. Her negatives, when they came, were rather feeble. [...] "I can't do it. It would be lovely, but--oh, it is impossible!" ...|$|E
60|$|Of course <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> swooned {{if she had}} {{not been}} alarmed by hearing the voices. These tales are dull enough, and many voices, like Dr. Johnson's mother's, when he heard her call his name, she being {{hundreds}} of miles away, lead to nothing and are not veracious. When they are veracious, {{as in the case of}} dreams, it may be by sheer accident.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; for {{the stolen}} {{property}} was still there. But yet how graceful she was, {{and how well}} her sorrows sat upon her! What <b>might</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done had the world used her more kindly, and not sent in her way that sore temptation! She was a woman {{for a man to}} have loved to madness." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to the Washington Post, {{there is}} {{widespread}} agreement that marijuana can put users in a relaxed and positive frame of mind (although some can experience feelings of anxiety and paranoia), and for that reason, it {{can be considered a}} performance-enhancing drug, providing an athlete serenity and confidence he or <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> otherwise <b>have</b> had. A 2006 article in the British Journal of Sports Medicine stated that THC, the primary psychoactive compound in marijuana, “engenders a certain heaviness, marked relaxation, and excessive fatigue of the limbs.” The article also noted that, because the product is usually smoked, that practice can have “detrimental effects on the lungs, oral cavity and upper respiratory tract.” ...|$|R
60|$|Kate's part in {{the pageant}} was humble enough, her duties being limited to holding {{articles}} of costume until Miss Knag was ready to try them on, and now and then tying a string, or fastening a hook-and-eye. <b>She</b> <b>might,</b> <b>not</b> unreasonably, <b>have</b> supposed herself beneath the reach of any arrogance, or bad humour; but it happened that the lady and daughter were both out of temper that day, and the poor girl came in for her share of their revilings. She was awkward--her hands were cold--dirty--coarse--she could do nothing right; they wondered how Madame Mantalini could have such people about her; requested they might see some other young woman {{the next time they}} came; and so forth.|$|R
60|$|Laura said nothing, {{though she}} {{understood}} {{exactly what he}} meant. She was becoming more sure that she liked the man, but she realized that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done so had she met him before she came out to Canada, where {{she had learned to}} recognize the essential points in character. There were certainly respects in which his manner would once have jarred upon her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure he won't mind that," [...] Mrs. March's {{voice said}} mechanically, while her thought {{was busy with}} the {{question}} whether this scandalous duplicity was altogether Kenby's, and whether Mrs. Adding was as guiltless of any share in it as she looked. She looked pitifully distracted; <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> understood his report; or Kenby might really have mistaken Mrs. March's sympathy for favor.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Harding {{acknowledged}} {{that he had not}} spoken of it, and then they calculated that perhaps <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> received any letter from her husband written since the news had reached him. [...] "Besides, why should he have mentioned it?" [...] said the major. [...] "He only knows as yet of the inquiry about the cheque, and can have heard nothing of what was done by the magistrates." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{a view to}} {{providing}} herself with a male escort Mrs. Chemping had invited her youngest nephew to accompany her {{on the first day}} of the shopping expedition, throwing in the additional allurement of a cinematograph theatre and the prospect of light refreshment. As Cyprian was not yet eighteen <b>she</b> hoped he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> reached that stage in masculine development when parcel-carrying is looked on as a thing abhorrent.|$|R
60|$|Her sunny drawing-room, {{with its}} {{gathered}} silk curtains, was especially beautiful; whatever the Leffingwells or Allisons may have lacked, {{it was not}} taste. Honora sat in it and wondered: wondered, as she looked back over the road she had threaded somewhat blindly towards the Ideal, whether <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> somewhere <b>have</b> taken the wrong turn. The farther she travelled, the more she seemed to penetrate into a land of unrealities. The exquisite objects by which she was surrounded, and which she had collected with such care, had no substance: she would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been greatly surprised, at any moment, to see them vanish like a scene in a theatre, leaning an empty, windy stage behind them. They {{did not belong to}} her, nor she to them.|$|R
50|$|Then soon after, Anna {{is invited}} to the youth club and is {{reluctant}} to go at first, but after one trip she realises she enjoys it. Through the youth club she gets to know Jeff, whom she thought has invited her on a date at first, but the vicar at the youth club got the name wrong, and through this <b>she</b> realised <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> actually <b>have</b> real feelings for Tony. In the next chapter, it mainly centres around Katy's obsession with her birthday. When Mrs Peacock denies her a birthday party, Katy gets upset and Anna buts in, trying to resolve the situation by volunteering to plan the party herself. Katy is really grateful to Anna for helping her.|$|R
