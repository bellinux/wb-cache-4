5|$|At {{first the}} art of music sought purity, limpidity and {{sweetness}} of sound. Then different sounds were amalgamated, care being taken, however, to caress the ear with gentle harmonies. Today music, as it becomes continually more complicated, strives to amalgamate the most dissonant, <b>strange</b> <b>and</b> harsh sounds. In this way we come ever closer to noise-sound.|$|E
5|$|Smith's six {{sons and}} three daughters mostly died young. One, Hugh Smith, {{inherited}} Weald and Hamerton from his older siblings in 1732 and appointed {{his two daughters}} as co-heirs. One of those daughters, Lucy, married into the Stanley family. Her husband changed his surname to become James Smith-Stanley, Lord <b>Strange,</b> <b>and</b> the couple were the parents of Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby.|$|E

She returned to England in 1992 and {{spent the rest of}} that year in County Durham, in a house that looked out over the North Sea. There she began working on her first novel, Jonathan <b>Strange</b> <b>and</b> Mr Norrell. In 1993, she was hired by Simon & Schuster in Cambridge to edit cookbooks, a job she kept for the next ten years.|$|E
5|$|Galveston is {{the setting}} of Sean Stewart's 2000 fantasy novel Galveston, in which a Flood of Magic takes over the island city, {{resulting}} in <b>strange</b> <b>and</b> carnivalesque adventures.

It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
5|$|Kaecilius {{uses the}} stolen pages {{to contact the}} {{powerful}} Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time is non-existent. Kaecilius destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off {{with the help of}} the Cloak of Levitation until Mordo and the Ancient One arrive. <b>Strange</b> <b>and</b> Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One's long life is due to her drawing power from the Dark Dimension. Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. <b>Strange</b> <b>and</b> Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension irresistibly engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then creates an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment of time. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he leave Earth and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the time loop.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{said that}} Spira {{deviates}} from {{the worlds of}} past Final Fantasy games most notably {{in the level of}} detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a <b>strange</b> <b>and</b> eccentric appearance.|$|E

5|$|Orton {{made his}} wrestling debut in 2000 at the Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling (MMWA-SICW) in St. Louis, Missouri, an {{offshoot}} of the historic St. Louis Wrestling Club headed by Sam Muchnick. There, he was trained by both the promotion and his father, Bob Orton Jr. He wrestled for the promotion for one month, where he performed with wrestlers such as Ace <b>Strange</b> <b>and</b> Mark Bland. Orton also refereed a few matches with World Organized Wrestling, a promotion where his uncle Barry Orton worked.|$|E
5|$|The comic {{tells the}} story of Antimony Carver, a young girl who has just started {{attending}} a school at a <b>strange</b> <b>and</b> mysterious place called Gunnerkrigg Court, and the events that unfold around her as she becomes embroiled in political intrigues between Gunnerkrigg Court and the inhabitants of the Gillitie Wood, a forest outside the school. The comic's style and themes include elements from science, fantasy creatures, mythology from a variety of traditions, and alchemical symbols and theories; the literary style is heavily influenced by mystery fiction and manga.|$|E
5|$|The jealous {{attention}} {{which has}} been paid to the unities both of time and place has taken away the principle of perspective in the drama, and all the interest which objects derive from distance, from contrast, from privation, from change of fortune, from long-cherished passion; and contrasts our view of life from a <b>strange</b> <b>and</b> romantic dream, long, obscure, and infinite, into a smartly contested, three hours' inaugural disputation on its merits by the different candidates for theatrical applause.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, and the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, <b>strange</b> <b>and</b> deadly rain in a migrant workers camp sends Mulder and Scully {{on the trail of}} a mythical beast—El Chupacabra. What they discover is a bizarre fungal growth affecting illegal immigrants.|$|E
5|$|The story {{starts out}} as a fairly {{conventional}} adventure at sea, but it becomes increasingly <b>strange</b> <b>and</b> hard to classify. Poe, who intended to present a realistic story, was inspired by several real-life accounts of sea voyages, and drew heavily from Jeremiah N. Reynolds and referenced the Hollow Earth theory. He also drew from his own experiences at sea. Analyses of the novel often focus on the potential autobiographical elements as well as hints of racism and the symbolism in the final lines of the work.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{observations}} of gravity-related phenomena during solar eclipses, especially during the period of totality. In 1954, and again in 1959, Maurice Allais reported observations of <b>strange</b> <b>and</b> unexplained movement during solar eclipses. The reality of this phenomenon, named the Allais effect, has remained controversial. Similarly, in 1970, Saxl and Allen observed the sudden change in motion of a torsion pendulum; this phenomenon is called the Saxl effect.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, she {{published}} {{a collection of}} her short stories, The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories (2006). Both Clarke's novel and her short stories are set in a magical England and written in a pastiche of the styles of 19th-century writers such as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. While Strange focuses {{on the relationship of}} two men, Jonathan <b>Strange</b> <b>and</b> Gilbert Norrell, the stories in Ladies focus on the power women gain through magic.|$|E
5|$|What keeps this densely {{realised}} confection aloft is {{that very}} quality of reverence to {{the writers of}} the past. The chief character in Jonathan <b>Strange</b> <b>and</b> Mr. Norrell isn't, in fact, either of the magicians: it's the library that they both adore, the books they consult and write and, in a sense, become. Clarke's giddiness comes from finding a way at once to enter the company of her literary heroes, to pay them homage and {{to add to the}} literature.|$|E
5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, the Ice and Fire series is {{generally}} praised {{for what is}} perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent <b>strange</b> <b>and</b> dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.|$|E
