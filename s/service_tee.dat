50|$|The third Italian Trans Europ Express (TEE) <b>service,</b> <b>TEE</b> Lemano, entered {{service in}} June 1958, {{one year after}} the start of the TEE network. The Italian TEE diesel {{multiple}} units (DMUs) of type ALn 442-448 weren't available in time for the launch of the TEE network on 2 June 1957, and consequently, none of the three planned Italian TEE services started at that time. Initially, the departure in Milan was just after nine in the morning, arriving just after lunch in Geneva, around 1:30 p.m. The return service left Geneva before dinner at 5:29 p.m., arriving in Milan around 9:40 p.m. This schedule was designed to allow a traveller to have lunch and dinner while riding along the shores of Lake Geneva and attend a meeting in Geneva during the afternoon. This timetable remained until 1 July 1961, when the TEE Cisalpin entered service. This Paris - Milan service used the Simplon railway as well, and in order to avoid two TEE trains running at nearly the same time from Lausanne to Milan, Lemano departure from Geneva was postponed to 7:40 p.m. This alteration was not appreciated by the customers because it made the scheduled arrival time in Milan very late in the evening, just before midnight. After two years it was decided to depart from Geneva at 1:30 p.m.; the departure from Milan was moved earlier as well. Returning business travellers could ride from Geneva to Lausanne after the meeting and board the TEE Cisalpin to Milan calling at around 6 p.m. On 28 May 1972, the DMUs were replaced by Gran Conforto coaches built by FIAT and hauled by electric locomotives. Despite attempts to improve the schedule, passenger numbers never reached a level as high as in the first three years, and eventually the Lemano was downgraded to a two-class InterCity service, on 23 May 1982. On 22 January 1984, the TGV-service Lausanne - Paris started, and the Paris - Milan services were split in two. The TGVs ran between Paris and Lausanne, and connecting InterCity trains using the same names ran between Lausanne and Milan. One of these split services was named Lemano. After the introduction of the EuroCity network, on 31 May 1987, the names remained unchanged. In 1989, the rolling stock on the Lausanne - Milan portion was replaced by Swiss RABe quadruple-voltage trainsets, which later on were replaced by Italian ETR470 tilting trains.|$|E
50|$|The <b>TEE</b> <b>service</b> {{started with}} trainnumber TEE 128 (Paris - Brussel), at 1 September 1963 the trainnumber TEE 119 was {{assigned}} to the southbound train. At 26 May 1967 the train was renumbered, the northbound <b>service</b> became <b>TEE</b> 64, the southbound <b>service</b> became <b>TEE</b> 61. At 23 May 1971 a new renumbering was implemented. All <b>TEE</b> <b>services</b> between Amsterdam and Paris got sequential numbers from 80 up to 87. The odd-numbers for northbound trains, the even-numbers for southboud trains. Within these numbers TEE 83 and TEE 84 were assigned to TEE Brabant.|$|R
50|$|The EuroCity label {{replaced}} the older Trans Europ Express (TEE) name for border-crossing trains in Europe. Whereas <b>TEE</b> <b>services</b> were first-class only, EuroCity trains convey {{first and second}} class coaches. The EuroCity schedule was designed with train pairs running one train in both directions, thus resulting in a more frequent <b>service</b> than the <b>TEE,</b> which normally ran only once a day.|$|R

5000|$|The Île de France was the French {{share of}} the initial <b>TEE</b> <b>services</b> on the PBA route. On 2 June 1957 the <b>TEE</b> <b>services</b> on the PBA route started with three trains. One of them, the TEE L'Oiseau Bleu, only served the Paris - Brussels section, the other, the TEE Étoile du Nord, linked Amsterdam with Paris. Both were {{existing}} <b>services</b> upgraded to <b>TEE</b> and were operated by Dutch and Belgian Railways. The Île de France was introduced as the [...] "mirror" [...] of the Étoile du Nord, that started {{in the morning in}} Amsterdam and returned to Amsterdam just before dinner. In order to have a morning service from Paris to Amsterdam, returning from Amsterdam in the evening the Île de France was added {{at the start of the}} TEE network.|$|R

50|$|The {{trainsets}} of Class VT 11.5 (often simply called TEE) were diesel {{multiple units}} built by Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) in 1957 {{and used for}} Trans Europ Express (<b>TEE)</b> <b>services.</b> Perceived as flagships of the DB rolling stock, they carried first-class seating only. When the UIC numbering scheme became effective on 1 January 1968, the power heads of the trainsets were renamed to Class 601 whilst the middle cars became Class 901 according to the DB locomotive classification. They were used for <b>TEE</b> <b>service</b> from 1957 until 1972 and thereafter on German InterCity services.|$|R

50|$|The Ambrosiano was a {{national}} (domestic) Italian express train which connected Rome with Milan. The name refers to {{the patron saint of}} Milan. For its first 13 years it was a Trans Europ Express (<b>TEE)</b> <b>service</b> (train nos. 78/79).|$|R
50|$|With the {{completion}} of the electrification works at the Dutch-German border on the Arnhem-Oberhausen line, the Rembrandt was launched on 28 May 1967. Of the then-three <b>TEE</b> <b>services</b> on that line, the Rembrandt was scheduled as the afternoon service from Amsterdam, between the Rheingold in the morning and the Rhein-Main in the evening. The Rembrandt conveyed through coaches for the TEE Helvetia that were exchanged in Mannheim, thus providing an afternoon <b>TEE</b> <b>service</b> between Amsterdam and Zürich via the Rhine Valley, alongside the TEE Edelweiss which departed from Amsterdam in the morning and was routed via Brussels and Luxembourg en route to Zurich. It carried a dining car staffed by the German Sleeper and Dining Car Company (DSG).|$|R

5000|$|On 24 September 1988, the Gottardo was {{reclassified}} as a EuroCity train. [...] It was {{the last}} international TEE at that time, but lost that distinction some years later, due to a short-lived revival of <b>TEE</b> <b>service</b> between Paris and Brussels from 1993 to 1995.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 the Rubens was, {{like the}} other Paris-Brussels <b>TEE</b> <b>services,</b> {{integrated}} into the new EuroCity network. On 23 May 1993 the EuroCity services between Paris and Brussels were classified as TEE again. After {{the opening of the}} LGV-Nord on 23 January 1995 the Rubens was withdrawn.|$|R
25|$|Between 1915 and 1918, the RE formed 76 AA Searchlight Sections for {{overseas}} <b>service.</b> The <b>TEE</b> {{is known}} to have found 21 of these: Nos 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 26–8, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44 and 46, together with No 22, which was formed in France from Nos 1–8 AAS sections. Others were formed by the Regular RE (No 1) and by the LEE. The parent units of a further 29 AAS sections are not known, but the cadres were probably mixed TEE and LEE personnel.|$|R
50|$|The SNCF {{initially}} {{used their}} RGP-825 diesel multiple units {{for this new}} <b>TEE</b> <b>service.</b> Meanwhile, the French started the development of locomotive hauled TEE coaches and multi system electric locomotives. The Swiss {{were the first to}} introduce quadruple voltage TEE trainsets in 1961, the French presented their class CC 40100 in 1964. On 31 May 1964 the Île de France was the first locomotive hauled TEE to use the specially made Inox-PBA coaches. On 2 August 1964 all <b>TEE</b> <b>services</b> on the PBA-route got Inox-PBA stock operated by the SNCF and NMBS. This stock stayed in use until the opening of the Paris-Brussels highspeed railway in 1995. However some modifications took place between 1983 and 1987, when a part of the coaches were refurbished to 2nd class and got a green band instead of a red (TEE) band above the windows.|$|R
5000|$|The forerunner to the Alaska Marine Highway was the Chilkoot Motorship Lines, {{founded in}} 1948 by Haines {{residents}} Steve Homer and Ray Gelotte. The company used a converted LCT-Mark VI landing craft, christened the [...] They operated a weekly <b>service</b> from <b>Tee</b> Harbor (north of Juneau) to Haines and Skagway, connecting the territorial capital {{to the international}} road system. The Chilkoot Motorship Lines was purchased by the territorial government, and moved under the Territorial Board of Road Commissioners in 1951. In 1957, the MV Chillkoot {{was replaced by the}} MV Chilkat, which remained a part of the system until being decommissioned in 1988.|$|R
50|$|In {{planning}} {{the launch of}} the <b>TEE</b> <b>services,</b> it was decided to use diesel-powered fixed sets for the new trains. While the French and the Italians refined existing designs, the Germans introduced a new design, the VT 11.5. The Swiss and Dutch railways cooperated on a joint development for a new 4-car diesel-electric trainset.|$|R
5000|$|The Ticino was {{an express}} train that linked Milan in Italy, with Zürich, Switzerland {{and for some}} years even to Munich, Germany. The train was named after the Canton of Ticino {{in the south of}} Switzerland. [...] Introduced in 1961, it was a first-class-only Trans Europ Express (<b>TEE)</b> <b>service</b> until 1974. Later, it was a EuroCity service.|$|R
50|$|In 1969 the Ferrovie dello Stato {{decided to}} replace their TEE diesel {{multiple}} units by locomotive hauled trains after the German and French examples. Because domestic TEE were allowed since 1965 the {{order for the}} Gran Conforto coaches was enlarged, not only to replace the existing international TEEs but also to convert the high-end domestic <b>services</b> to <b>TEE.</b> The Freccia del Vesuvio was upgraded to TEE Vesuvio {{as soon as the}} new rolling stock was available at 30 September 1973. The TEE Vesuvio was operated with E444 locomotives hauling Gran Conforto coaches. Remarkable is that the Vesuvio conveyed two dining cars from 26 May 1974 until 30 September 1979.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, the {{southbound}} morning {{train and}} northbound evening train were downgraded to a two-class Rapide, while the northbound morning train and southbound evening train remained a first-class-only Trans Europ Express. All four trains were still called Le Capitole. Also, the remaining <b>TEE</b> <b>service</b> now operated only {{six days a}} week: daily except Saturdays northbound and daily except Sundays southbound.|$|R
50|$|On 28 May 1967, the Oberhausen-Arnhem railway {{electrification}} works were completed and Rhein-Main's rolling stock {{was replaced by}} electric-locomotive-hauled trains. Because of poor loading figures on the evening service between Bonn and Frankfurt the southbound service was shortened to Bonn on 26 September 1971. The northbound route continued to start in Frankfurt. On 28 May 1972, the <b>service</b> was renamed <b>TEE</b> Van Beethoven.|$|R
50|$|The Swiss SBB and the Dutch NS {{developed}} the RAm TEE (Dutch: DE) for the routes Zurich-Amsterdam and Amsterdam-Brussels-Paris. These trains {{were sold in}} 1977 to the Canadian Ontario Northland Railway (ONR) and served on the line Toronto-Moosonee as the Northlander. From 1961, SBB used the SBB RAe TEE II, a four system electric streamlined trainset for the <b>TEE</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 27 May 1979, the Blauer Enzian was {{downgraded}} to a two-class Intercity, {{no longer}} serving Hamburg, but instead, running southbound as Dortmund - Munich - Klagenfurt and northbound as Klagenfurt - Munich - Dortmund - Braunschweig. The <b>TEE</b> <b>service</b> between Hamburg and Munich {{was taken over}} by the TEE Diamant. [...] By 1981, the northbound route was also terminating in Dortmund.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} depot was closed on 1 October 1948. In the late 1970s, the Lauterecken track supervisor’s office, which for decades {{had been in}} charge of the maintenance of the Glan Valley Railway and the Lauter Valley Railway near the town, was closed. In 1983, the Lauter Valley Railway celebrated its centenary and for this purpose a Trans Europ Express (<b>TEE)</b> <b>service</b> ran between Kaiserslautern and Lauterecken-Grumbach.|$|R
50|$|In 1969 the Ferrovie dello Stato {{decided to}} replace their TEE diesel {{multiple}} units by locomotive hauled trains after the German and French examples. Because domestic TEE were allowed since 1965 the {{order for the}} Gran Conforto coaches was enlarged, not only to replace the existing international TEEs but also to convert the high-end domestic <b>services</b> to <b>TEE.</b> After delivery of the international coaches in 1972, two consists of 8 and 9 coaches each, were available {{in the spring of}} 1973 and on 3 June 1973 the Adriatico became the first Italian domestic <b>TEE.</b> Initially the <b>service</b> took 8 h 35 min from Milan to Bari, thus reaching an average speed of 101 km/h.|$|R
50|$|The Gottardo {{provided}} a high-speed, first-class train service between Zürich Hauptbahnhof and Milano Centrale station, starting in 1961. It was {{operated by the}} Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS) and Italian State Railways (FS), and during its years as a <b>TEE</b> <b>service</b> it used the former's RAe TEE II-type electric multiple unit trainsets. These were air-conditioned and the normally six-car train included a restaurant car, operated by the Swiss Restaurant Car Company.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 the Île de France was, {{like the}} other PBA <b>TEE</b> <b>services,</b> {{integrated}} into the new EuroCity network. On 23 May 1993 the EuroCity services between Paris and Brussels were classified as TEE again. After {{the opening of the}} LGV-Nord on 23 January 1995 the Brussels - Paris service was withdrawn and by the time this highspeed railway was fully operational on 26 May 1995 the opposite service was withdrawn too.|$|R
50|$|The Brabant was {{introduced}} in the TEE-network to cope with the raising number of passengers between Paris and Brussels. This fourth <b>TEE</b> <b>service</b> between the two cities was planned to be the first through electric service on this railway line. However, due to the Big Freeze of 1963, the overhead lines works were behind schedule and at 26 May 1963 the service was started with a northbound only DMU, detached from the existing TEE Île de France.|$|R
50|$|The Rembrandt was {{the first}} TEE to call in Baden-Wurtemberg's capital, Stuttgart. Northbound, the Rembrandt {{departed}} for Amsterdam from Munich early in the morning, thus providing a morning service complementing the existing afternoon <b>TEE</b> <b>service</b> provided by the Rheinpfeil. On 27 May 1979, the exchange of coaches with the Helvetia was discontinued, and the stop at Mannheim {{was replaced by a}} stop at Darmstadt. On 1 June 1980, the route was shortened to Stuttgart at the southern end.|$|R
5000|$|A Trans-Europ-Express (first class only) {{service was}} {{introduced}} in the 1969/70 winter timetable, running on the Munich-Lindau-Bregenz-St. Margrethen-St. Gallen-Winterthur-Zurich (lines 56 and 57), called Bavaria. On the evening of 9 February 1971 a <b>TEE</b> 56 <b>service</b> derailed on the Munich-Zurich route at Aitrang due to speeding, killing 28 people and seriously injuring 42. In 1977, the <b>TEE</b> <b>service</b> was replaced by a [...] "D" [...] (two-class express) service between Zurich and Munich (lines 276 and 277).|$|R
5000|$|After {{their use}} on <b>TEE</b> <b>services</b> ended, the RAe TEE II sets were {{converted}} to two-class trains, redesignated type RABe EC, repainted from red-and-cream to two-tone grey, and put into use on EuroCity services from Zürich to Milano (the EC Gottardo), Zürich to Stuttgart, and Lausanne to Milano (the EC Lemano and EC Lutetia). Their new livery earned them the nickname [...] "grey mouse". They were removed from EuroCity service in 1994 and retired from regular service altogether in late 1999.|$|R
5000|$|The Cycnus was {{introduced}} on 30 September 1973 {{in order to}} improve the first class-only Trans Europ Express (<b>TEE)</b> <b>service</b> along the Ligurian coast. The schedule was designed as a [...] "mirror" [...] of the TEE Ligure, resulting in a very early departure from the French-Italian border in Ventimiglia and returning from Milan just after midnight. While the Ligure had constant loading figures, the Cycnus ran almost empty {{at the beginning of the}} week, but had to be extended to 11 coaches on Fridays.|$|R
