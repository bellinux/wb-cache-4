[...] Confessor! to thy <b>secret</b> <b>ear</b> [...] 1320 [...] I breathe the sorrows I bewail, [...] And thank thee for the generous tear [...] This glazing eye could never shed.

60|$|Villette owns {{a climate}} as variable, though not so humid, {{as that of}} any English town. A night of high wind {{followed}} upon that soft sunset, and all {{the next day was}} one of dry storm--dark, beclouded, yet rainless,--the streets were dim with sand and dust, whirled from the boulevards. I know not that even lovely weather would have tempted me to spend the evening-time of study and recreation where I had spent it yesterday. My alley, and, indeed, all the walks and shrubs in the garden, had acquired a new, but not a pleasant interest; their seclusion was now become precarious; their calm--insecure. That casement which rained billets, had vulgarized the once dear nook it overlooked; and elsewhere, the eyes of the flowers had gained vision, and the knots in the tree-boles listened like <b>secret</b> <b>ears.</b> Some plants there were, indeed, trodden down by Dr. John in his search, and his hasty and heedless progress, which I wished to prop up, water, and revive; some footmarks, too, he had left on the beds: but these, in spite of the strong wind, I found a moment's leisure to efface very early in the morning, ere common eyes had discovered them. With a pensive sort of content, I sat down to my desk and my German, while the pupils settled to their evening lessons; and the other teachers took up their needlework.|$|R
60|$|A {{travelling}} writing-case stood open on a {{table near}} them. In an interval of silence the girl looked at it reluctantly. They had been talking of family affairs--and had spoken in Italian, so as to keep their domestic <b>secrets</b> from the <b>ears</b> of the strangers about them. The old woman {{was the first to}} resume the conversation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen to this," [...] I went on, {{reading from}} Benjamin's notes. [...] "What did Dexter mean when he said, 'Number Nine, Caldershaws. Ask for Dandie. You shan't have the Diary. A <b>secret</b> in your <b>ear.</b> The Diary will hang him?' How came Dexter {{to know what}} was in my husband's Diary? And what does he mean by 'Number Nine, Caldershaws,' and the rest of it? Facts again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since {{it is your}} will, Brother, that I {{should talk}} <b>secrets</b> into other <b>ears</b> than yours, I obey you. Still"--here {{she looked at me}} wrathfully--"let the tongue be careful that it does not repeat what the ears have heard, lest there should be neither ears nor tongue. My Brother, it has been {{reported}} to Pharaoh, while we ate together, that there is tumult in this town. It has been reported to him that because of a trouble about some base Israelite you caused one of his officers to be beheaded, after which there came a riot which still rages." ...|$|R
25|$|Finally, Gold {{receives}} {{a visit from}} The Snow Queen, who is {{ready to make a}} deal with him, as she has now figured out what his plan is. The Snow Queen knows that Gold wants to leave Storybrooke with Belle and to be free of the Dagger of Kris, while the Snow Queen wants Storybrooke all to herself, and she says that she has the secret to the missing ingredient he needs. She then asks for the ribbons, and as he gives them to her, the Snow Queen whispers the <b>secret</b> into his <b>ear.</b> Then, Mr. Gold says that he will obtain the final ingredient with great pleasure, causing the Snow Queen to stare at him with a shocked expression.|$|R
6000|$|To most men, {{as it does}} to ourselves, {{all this}} will seem overcharged. We too have walked through Monmouth Street; but with little feeling of [...] "Devotion:" [...] {{probably}} in part because the contemplative process is so fatally broken in upon by the brood of money-changers who nestle in that Church, and importune the worshipper with merely secular proposals. Whereas Teufelsdrockh, might be in that happy middle state, which leaves to the Clothes-broker no hope either of sale or of purchase, and so be allowed to linger there without molestation.--Something we would have given to see the little philosophical figure, with its steeple-hat and loose flowing skirts, and eyes in a fine frenzy, [...] "pacing and repacing in austerest thought" [...] that foolish Street; which to him was a true Delphic avenue, and supernatural Whispering-gallery, where the [...] "Ghosts of Life" [...] rounded strange <b>secrets</b> in his <b>ear.</b> O thou philosophic Teufelsdrockh, that listenest while others only gabble, and with thy quick tympanum hearest the grass grow! ...|$|R
60|$|One day, {{about three}} months after I was {{committed}} to prison, we were all told off as usual {{to work in a}} small quarry on the cliff-side overhanging the long expanse of pebbly beach known as the Chesil. I had reason to believe afterwards that a large open fishing boat lying upon the beach below at the moment had been placed there as part of a concerted scheme by the friends of the Hampstead burglar; and that it contained ordinary clothing for all the men in our gang, except myself only. The idea was evidently that the gang should overpower the warder, seize the boat, change their clothes instantly, taking turns about meanwhile with the navigation, and make straight off for the shore at Lulworth, where they could easily disperse without much chance of being recaptured. But of all this I was of course quite ignorant at the time, for they had not thought well to intrust their <b>secret</b> to the <b>ears</b> of the sneaking virtuous Methodist.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the crucial}} moment. But {{my voice was}} a strange voice, and in it he {{recognized}} nothing familiar. The meal went on. I talked a great deal, and enthusiastically, as a hero-worshipper might talk, and {{it was obvious that}} he was my hero. I rose to a climax of enthusiasm and worship, and, before he could guess my intention, threw my arms around his neck and kissed him on the lips. He held me from him at arm's length and stared about in annoyance and perplexity. The four men greeted him with roars of laughter, and explanations were made. At first he was sceptical. He scrutinized me keenly and was half convinced, then shook his head and would not believe. It was not until I became the old Avis Everhard and whispered <b>secrets</b> in his <b>ear</b> that none knew but he and Avis Everhard, that he accepted me as his really, truly wife.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Maid {{said to the}} Mistress. No--the Mistress said to the Maid. The Mistress said, 'Show him the letter. Must, must, must do it.' The Maid said, 'No. Mustn't do it. Shan't show it. Stuff. Nonsense. Let him suffer. We can get him off. Show it? No. Let {{the worst}} come to the worst. Show it, then.' The Mistress said--" [...] He paused, and waved his hand rapidly to and fro before his eyes, {{as if he were}} {{brushing}} away some visionary confusion or entanglement. [...] "Which was it last?" [...] he said--"Mistress or Maid? Mistress? No. Maid speaks, of course. Loud. Positive. 'You scoundrels. Keep away from that table. The Diary's there. Number Nine, Caldershaws. Ask for Dandie. You shan't have the Diary. A <b>secret</b> in your <b>ear.</b> The Diary will hang, him. I won't have him hanged. How dare you touch my chair? My chair is Me! How dare you touch Me?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|There is an {{instinct}} {{in the human}} heart Which makes that all the fables it hath coined, To justify the reign of its belief And strengthen it by beauty's right divine, Veil in their inner cells a mystic gift, Which, like the hazel twig, in faithful hands, Points surely to the hidden springs of truth.

60|$|And now my {{advocate}} {{began asking}} questions--vague, useless questions--in a slow, hesitating fashion which set Toussac grumbling. This cross-examination {{appeared to me}} to be a useless farce; and yet there was a certain eagerness and intensity in my questioner's manner which gave me the assurance that he had some end in view. Was it merely that he wished to gain time? Time for what? And then, suddenly, with that quick perception which comes upon those whose nerves are strained by an extremity of danger, I became convinced that he really was awaiting something--that he was tense with expectation. I read it upon his drawn face, upon his sidelong head with his ear scooped into his hand, above all in his twitching, restless eyes. He expected an interruption, and he was talking, talking, talking, in order to gain time for it. I was as sure of it as if he had whispered his <b>secret</b> in my <b>ear,</b> and down in my numb, cold heart a warm little spring of hope began to bubble and run.|$|R

6000|$|... "Loved me, false, kill," [...] echoed Fanny scornfully, with a leer which {{transformed}} {{her beauty}} into a mere vulgar grimace. [...] "Is there any {{end to the}} deceits of the little gaby? Do you really suppose that to be loved is a new experience for me; that I'm not smeared with it wherever I go; that I care a snap of my fingers whether I'm loved or not; that I couldn't win through without that? Is that what you suppose? Well, then, here's one more <b>secret.</b> Open your <b>ears.</b> I am going to marry Percy Maudlen. Yes, that weed of a creature. You may remember my little prophecy when he brought his Aunt Alice's manikin some lollipops. Well, the grace of God is too leisurely, and since you and I are both, I suppose, of the same sex, I tell you I care no more for him than that----" [...] She flung the nectarine stone at the beehive. [...] "And I defy you, defy you to utter a word. I am glad I was born what I am. All your pretty little triumphs, first to last, what are they?--accidents and insults. Isn't half the world kicking down the faces of those beneath them on the ladder? I have had to fight for a place. And I tell you this: I am going to teach these supercilious money-smelling ladies a lesson. I am going to climb till I can sneer down on them. And Mrs Monnerie {{is going to help}} me. She doesn't care a jot for God or man. But she enjoys intelligence, and loves a fighter. Is that candour? Is it now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is really}} not much to tell," [...] cried Dorian, as they took their seats at the small round table. [...] "What {{happened}} was simply this. After I left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and went down at eight o'clock to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind. Of course the scenery was dreadful, and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl! You should have seen her! When she came on in her boy's clothes she was perfectly wonderful. She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves, slim brown cross-gartered hose, a dainty little green cap with a hawk's feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak lined with dull red. She had never seemed to me more exquisite. She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine {{that you have in}} your studio, Basil. Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose. As for her acting--well, you shall see her to-night. She is simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled. I forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the performance was over I went behind, and spoke to her. As we were sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each other. I can't describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose-coloured joy. She trembled all over, and shook like a white narcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can't help it. Of course our engagement is a dead secret. She has not even told her own mother. I don't know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is sure to be furious. I don't care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and then I can do what I like. I have been right, Basil, haven't I, to take my love out of poetry, and to find my wife in Shakespeare's plays? Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their <b>secret</b> in my <b>ear.</b> I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the mouth." ...|$|R
6000|$|But, {{these are}} small oases, and I am soon back again in {{metropolitan}} Arcadia. It is my impression {{that much of}} its serene and peaceful character is attributable {{to the absence of}} customary Talk. How do I know but there may be subtle influences in Talk, to vex the souls of men who don't hear it? How do I know but that Talk, five, ten, twenty miles off, may get into the air and disagree with me? If I rise from my bed, vaguely troubled and wearied and sick of my life, in the session of Parliament, who shall say that my noble friend, my right reverend friend, my right honourable friend, my honourable friend, my honourable and learned friend, or my honourable and gallant friend, may not be responsible for that effect upon my nervous system? Too much Ozone in the air, I am informed and fully believe (though I {{have no idea what it}} is), would affect me in a marvellously disagreeable way; why may not too much Talk? I don't see or hear the Ozone; I don't see or hear the Talk. And there is so much Talk; so much too much; such loud cry, and such scant supply of wool; such a deal of fleecing, and so little fleece! Hence, in the Arcadian season, I find it a delicious triumph to walk down to deserted Westminster, and see the Courts shut up; to walk a little further and see the Two Houses shut up; to stand in the Abbey Yard, like the New Zealander of the grand English History (concerning which unfortunate man, a whole rookery of mares' nests is generally being discovered), and gloat upon the ruins of Talk. Returning to my primitive solitude and lying down to sleep, my grateful heart expands with the consciousness that there is no adjourned Debate, no ministerial explanation, nobody to give notice of intention to ask the noble Lord at the head of her Majesty's Government five-and-twenty bootless questions in one, no term time with legal argument, no Nisi Prius with eloquent appeal to British Jury; that the air will to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, remain untroubled by this superabundant generating of Talk. In a minor degree it is a delicious triumph to me to go into the club, and see the carpets up, and the Bores and the other dust dispersed to the four winds. Again, New Zealander-like, I stand on the cold hearth, and say in the solitude, 'Here I watched Bore A 1, with voice always mysteriously low and head always mysteriously drooped, whispering political <b>secrets</b> into the <b>ears</b> of Adam's confiding children. Accursed be his memory for ever and a day!' ...|$|R
