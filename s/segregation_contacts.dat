Using unit record data from Statistics New Zealand’s 1997 to 2000 Income Surveys and controlling for productivity characteristics, we find evidence that Maori are consistently segregated into lower occupational classes than their measurable characteristics would predict. In addition, we estimate that discrimination of some form accounts for between 30 % to 48 % of the Pakeha/Maori wage differential.

Taken together, the articles call for a reinterpretation of the spaces of contact in everyday life, with a new focus on the ‘micro-ecology’ of racialised divisions. Contributions are made in three areas: (a) meta-theory, with a turn to materiality, (b) new methodologies, and (c) understandings of racial <b>segregation</b> and <b>contact.</b> The contact hypothesis is reconsidered with new emphases on relations between bodies–space–time.

40|$|In {{addition}} to neighbourhoods of residence, family and places of work play {{important roles in}} producing and reproducing ethnic segregation. Therefore, recent research on ethnic <b>segregation</b> and <b>contact</b> is increasingly turning its attention from residential areas towards other important domains of daily interethnic contact. The key innovation {{of this paper is}} to clarify the role of immigrants' pre-hire exposure to natives in the residence, workplace and family domains in immigrant exposure to natives in their current workplace. The study is based on Swedish population register data. The results show that at the macro level, workplace neighbourhood segregation is lower than residential neighbourhood segregation. Our micro-level analysis further shows that high levels of residential exposure of immigrants to natives help to reduce ethnic segregation at the level of workplace establishments as well. neighbourhood effects, residential segregation, workplace segregation, intermarriage, longitudinal analysis, Sweden...|$|R
40|$|The above {{statements}} may {{be summarized}} as follows:- a. During the consolidation of magma, various magmatic emanations are exuded, by the petrification of which ore-deposits are formed. b. A definite process of deposition of emanations determines the order of petrification, as stated in Section 3, p. 4. c. The ore-deposits of igneous origin may be classified into five divisions; magmatic <b>segregations,</b> <b>contacts,</b> replacements, mineral veins and impregnations. d. There are several kinds of igneous rocks called ore-bringers, which produced the ore-deposits by their "eruptive after-action. " e. The Japanese empire is divided from the metallogenetic point of view into five provinces, according to the difference of the ore-bringers. They are as follows:- (Table) f. The minerals in the ore-deposits in the different provinces are distributed {{in the order of}} petrification as in the following table: - (Table) As the reader will see, in the pertrification order all the minerals except calcite are found in the Provinces of Korea and Kitakami. This is because they all belong to the older veins, which means that the formation of the minerals took place in the deep, where the temperature of the emanations was very high, the petrification continuing until the emanations got entirely cool. The pyrite beds in the Besshi Province are supposed to have been emitted from the most basic rocks such as serpentine or gabbro, and therefore only the minerals of the lower position in the pertrification order are deposited there. The scantiness of quartz in the pyritic beds is explained by the basic character of the supposed ore-bringers. In the Provinces of Kosaka and Satsuma only the ore-deposits of younger formation are distributed and therefore such minerals as iron oxides or ferromagnesian silicates are never found there. Sulphides are more abundant in the Kosaka, Province than in the Satsuma Province, for the fusing point of quartz-trachyte is higher than that of andesite. In the gold veins in the Satsuma Province, sulphides are very scanty, but if we go deep down we shall find much more of the sulphides which are of a higher pertrification order than quartz and calcite, the two predominating vein-stuffs of the Satsuma Province...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} zip code-level risk {{factors associated with}} very high tuberculosis (TB) rates among non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians in New Jersey (1985 - 1992). METHODS: Exposure indices (poverty, crowded housing, and dilapidated housing) and <b>segregation</b> indices (<b>contact</b> with immigrants, isolation, and density) were used to characterize zip codes. A Boolean-logic methodology {{was used to determine}} which configurations of risk factors significantly distinguish zip codes where TB rates are very high from other zip codes. RESULTS: For Whites and Asians, risk factors were rare in zip codes with very high TB rates. In agreement with the distribution of TB cases by age and foreign-born status, this suggests that cases among Whites may be caused by reactivation, whereas cases among Asians may be imported. In contrast, Hispanics and African Americans were exposed to risk factors that may facilitate TB transmission. Among Hispanics, high contact with immigrants was an important factor. African Americans were the group most frequently exposed to multiple risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: For Hispanics and African Americans, zip code-level risk factors were associated with very high TB rates...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} different conditions for integration of immigrants in Swedish rural municipalities. The study examine different assessments by members of the Swedish Rural Network’s Working Group on Integration. The overarching question is what opportunities and obstacles they experience in the integration of immigrants in rural municipalities. This is explored through a series of semistructured interviews, based on three themes of integration: job market integration, social integration and housing integration. The study shows that low residential <b>segregation,</b> closer <b>contact</b> between residents and a committed civil society in rural municipalities create opportunities for integration. The need of labor in different sectors of the job market of rural municipalities and the skills of immigrants can also provide opportunities for integration. The investigation shows how the lack of service and infrastructure, limited labor market, lack of housing and xenophobia are obstacles for the integration of immigrants in rural municipalities. The study points at various measures to improve integration. Among them is the need of immigrant reception to be coupled with development in rural municipalities, with improved plans for housing and infrastructure. Coordination of the skills of immigrants and the work opportunities in rural municipalities is another important measure...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} thermal {{and electrical}} characterization of SiGe/Si multi-quantum wells (MQWs) with different layer profiles in complete bolometer structures. The thermal {{property of the}} bolometers was studied by measuring thermal coefficient of resistivity (TCR) through I-V curves for five temperatures (25, 40, 55, 80 and 100 degC) and for four different pixel areas. The results show a strong dependency of TCR on the Si/SiGe layer thickness {{and the presence of}} dopant impurity in the MQW. The noise measurements of MQWs were performed carefully by eliminating all external contributions and the noise spectroscopy provided the noise characteristic parameters. The results demonstrate that the noise depends on the geometric size of the MQW and it increases with decreasing of the pixel area. The investigations show the noise level in the bolometer structures is sensitive to any dopant <b>segregation</b> from the <b>contact</b> layers...|$|R
40|$|A {{previous}} dislocation model analysis {{predicts that}} nano-scale contacts of surface steps induce nucleation of dislocations leading to pro-load and anti-load dislocation <b>segregation</b> near the <b>contact</b> surface.

In order to verify the predictions of the model analysis, experiments are carried out on polycrystalline aluminum surface to determine the existence of the tensile sub-layer. The variation of the residual stress along the thickness direction is measured using a newly developed high sensitivity curvature-measurement interferometer. The interferometer measures the curvature change of the back surface of a plate specimen of about 1. 9 mm thickness while the contact-loaded front surface is chemically etched.

A recent dislocation model analysis predicts that nano-scale contacts of surface steps induce nucleation of dislocations leading to pro-load and anti-load dislocation <b>segregation</b> near the <b>contact</b> surface. Such dislocation segregation generates a sub-layer of tensile residual stress in a much thicker layer of compressive residual stress near the surface.

The variation of the residual stress along the thickness direction is measured using a newly developed high sensitivity curvature-measurement interferometer. The residual stress distribution measured with sub-nanometer spatial resolution indicates that contact loading leads to formation of a highly stressed sub-layer of tensile residual stress within a much thicker layer of compressive residual stress. Implications of tensile residual stress for delamination wear are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of migrants has been exercising {{minds in the}} Netherlands for several decades now. The tone of the debate in both the political and public arena has frequently been sombre, reflecting the widespread feeling that large sections of the migrant population, and especially migrants with a Muslim background, had little connection with Dutch society. This report describes the position regarding the {{integration of}} migrant groups in the Netherlands and looks in depth at trends in the integration process. Integration is broken down into several dimensions in this report. This means that attention is devoted among other things to trends in education and on the labour market, but also to trends in spatial <b>segregation,</b> crime, interethnic <b>contact,</b> religious behaviour and command of the Dutch language. The picture that emerges is a mixed one. Migrants still lag behind considerably in many areas; at the same time, however, they are making up ground fast on several fronts.

The 2 D solid-state NMR experiments demonstrate that the film morphology of PCPDTBT:PC 60 BM blends processed with additives such as octanedithiol (ODT) {{are similar to those}} of PSBTBT:PC 60 BM blends in terms of crystallinity, phase <b>segregation,</b> and interfacial <b>contacts.</b> The TA experiments and analysis of the TA data by multivariate curve resolution (MCR) reveal that after exciton dissociation and free charge formation, fast sub-nanosecond non-geminate recombination occurs which leads to a substantial population of the polymer's triplet state. The extent to which triplet states are formed depends on the initial concentration of free charges, which itself is controlled by the microstructure of the blend, especially in case of PCPDTBT:PC 60 BM. Interestingly, PSBTBT:PC 70 BM blends show a higher charge generation efficiency, but less triplet state formation at similar free charge carrier concentrations. This indicates that the solid-state morphology and interfacial structures of PSBTBT:PC 70 BM blends reduces non-geminate recombination, leading to superior device performance compared to optimized PCPDTBT:PC 60 BM blends...|$|R
40|$|Activation of {{tyrosine}} kinases during integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion {{is involved}} {{both in the}} regulation of focal contact assembly and in the initiation of signaling processes at the cell-matrix adhesive interface. In {{order to determine the}} role of pp 60 (c-src) and related kinases in these processes, we have compared the dynamic reorganization of phosphotyrosine, vinculin, focal adhesion kinase and tensin in cells with altered expression of Src-family kinases. Both null cells for pp 60 (c-src) and triple knockout cells for pp 60 (c-src), pp 59 (fyn), and pp 62 (c-yes) exhibited decreased phosphotyrosine levels in focal contacts when compared with wild-type cells. pp 60 (c-src) -null cells also exhibited faster assembly of cell-matrix adhesions and a more exuberant recruitment of FAK to these sites. Tensin, which normally segregates into fibrillar adhesions was localized in large focal contacts in the two mutant cell lines, suggesting involvement of pp 60 (c-src) in the <b>segregation</b> of focal <b>contacts</b> and fibrillar adhesions. Moreover, treatment of wild-type cells with tyrphostin AG 1007, which inhibits both pp 60 (c-src) and FAK activity, induced accumulation of tensin in peripheral focal adhesions. These findings demonstrate that Src family kinases, and pp 60 (c-src) in particular, have a central role in regulating protein dynamics at cell-matrix interfaces, both during early stages of interaction and in mature focal contacts...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} four {{important}} physical and material aspects faced by MOSFET devices as dimensions {{move to the}} length scale of 10 nm have been investigated: i) metal source/drain <b>contacts</b> with dopant <b>segregation</b> for reduced <b>contact</b> resistance and improved carrier injection; ii) variability of the Schottky-barrier height (SBH) in MOSFET contacts; iii) strained silicon as a high mobility channel material; iv) silicon nanowire (NW) MOSFETs in order to suppress short channel effects by a multi-gate architecture. Ultimately scaled devices require highly conductive contacts with abrupt junctions. However, due to Fermi-level pinning at the metal-semiconductor interface, the performance of SB-MOSFETs still falls behind that of conventional FETs. Nickel-silicidation induced dopant segregation is highly effective in improving carrier injection through SBs, resulting in higher Ion/Ioff -ratios and better sub-threshold swings. Arsenic dopant segregation has been studied in detail {{as a function of}} NiSi thickness, implantation energy and dose, as well as process conditions for the formation of NiSi. It is shown that dopant concentrations as high as the solid solubility and lateral dopant slopes of 1 - 2 nm/dec at the NiSi/Si-contact interface can be obtained. Simulations of scaled ultra-thin-body SOI MOSFETs with dopant segregation demonstrated that these devices can be scaled down to channel lengths of L= 10 nm. Variability in the electrical characteristics of SB-MOSFETs without and with dopant segregation has been investigated by a new experimental method, that allows to measure the impact of various sources leading to variability. The inherent variability of the SBH has been identifed as the main source of variability and an increase in SBH variability due to dopant segregation by 0. 01 eV was found. The importance of SBH variability for the on-current, even for very low SBHs of 0. 03 eV, was demonstrated with simulations. High mobility channel materials are required, as the steady increase of carrier velocity with gate-length scaling reaches its limit. Several aspects of the fabrication of biaxial tensile strained SSOI substrates by strain transfer between a thin SiGe buffer and a Si cap layer have been investigated with emphasis on reducing the threading dislocation density to 1 x 10 e 6 cm- 2. Thin SiGe/Si-heterostructure lines featuring highly asymmetric strain were fabricated that show decreased resistivities for electrons and holes. Asymmetric strain relaxation relies on the limitation of the path length of threading dislocations by the stripe boundaries in thin SiGe/Si lines, leading to an asymmetrical dislocation network. The electrical properties of biaxial tensile strained (001) SSOI with a stress of 1. 2 GPa have been studied using Hall-bar MOSFETs. SSOI devices showed improved on-currents, mobilities and transconductances over unstrained parallel processed devices. The mobility in n-type SSOI had a peak value of 1250 cm 2 /Vs at low vertical electric field, an enhancement by a factor of 1. 7 compared to unstrained Si. The impact of biaxial strain on the electron affinity was determined by measuring threshold voltage shifts between strained and unstrained devices. The effective electron mass in 60 nm biaxial tensile strained (001) SSOI and unstrained SOI was determined to be meff = 0. 20 m 0 from Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the longitudinal resistance. This proves that biaxial tensile stress of 1. 2 GPa does not warp the Delta 2 constant energy surfaces of the Si conduction band for in-plane directions, in agreement with band structure calculations. The mobility increase in biaxial tensile strained SSOI is, therefore, caused by the occupation of the Delta 2 -valleys with low effective electron mass mt in transport direction and reduced scattering due to a smaller k-space volume. To avoid short channel effects in ultimately scaled FETs multi-gate geometries have to be used. A fully CMOS compatible fabrication process for Si NW-FETs has been developed and devices with trapezoidal cross-sections of about 40 x 40 nm 2 were fabricated, featuring excellent electrical characteristics. Current flow on different crystal planes in multi-gate devices has been used {{to take advantage of the}} anisotropy of conductivity in Si in order to match the on-currents of n- and p-type MOSFETs with the same dimensions. Improved electron mobility due to strain and excellent electrostatics due to a multi-gate architecture were combined in a uniaxial tensile strained NW-FET. Size-dependent lateral strain relaxation of nanostructures was used to transform biaxial tensile strain into uniaxial tensile strain along the NW. Uniaxial tensile strained NW n-FETs show a factor x 2. 3 enhanced mobility and improvements in on-current and transconductance by a factor of x 2. 5 and x 2. 1, respectively. Circular suspended NWs with diameters down to < 15 nm were fabricated and the possibility to integrate them into gate-all-around devices has been demonstrated...|$|R
