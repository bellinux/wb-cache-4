500|$|Rabi died at {{his home}} on Riverside Drive in Manhattan from cancer on 11 January 1988. His wife, Helen, survived him and {{died at the age}} of 102 on 18 June 2005. In his last days, he was {{reminded}} of his greatest achievement when his physicians examined him using magnetic resonance imaging, a technology that had been developed from his ground-breaking research on magnetic resonance. The machine happened to have a reflective inner surface, and he remarked: [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> in that machine... I never thought my work would come to this." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 5, 2010, Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that Dirty Sexy Money actor Seth Gabel had been {{cast as the}} lead Fringe investigator in the parallel universe, and would be making his first appearance in the finale as a possible recurring character. Jeff Pinkner described the character as [...] "the scientist-cop-leader of the team on the Other Side." [...] In an interview with TV Guide, Gabel commented that during shooting {{he felt that he}} looked [...] "like such a doofus holding a gun," [...] but changed his mind when he saw the finished production. Gabel elaborated, [...] "I was so scared that I wouldn't pull it off. Once I <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> being a scientist-slash-FBI hero, I felt more confident and relaxed." [...] His character is caught in a large explosion in the finale, but Gabel confirmed, in a Chicago Tribune interview, that his character would be returning for the third season. He states that the parallel universe has [...] "special technology than can heal burns".|$|E
500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is it true?' 'Quite true; not the {{slightest}} doubt. <b>Saw</b> him <b>myself.</b> Not at all hissed; certainly not hooted. Perhaps a little hissed. One fellow really cheered him. <b>Saw</b> him <b>myself.</b> Say what they like, there is reaction.' 'But Constitution Hill, they say?' 'Well, there {{was a sort of}} inclination to a row on Constitution Hill; but the Duke quite firm; pistols, and carriage doors bolted.' ...|$|R

500|$|James Guthrie, {{recommended}} by previous Floyd collaborator Alan Parsons, arrived {{early in the}} production process. He replaced engineer Brian Humphries, emotionally drained by his five years with the band. [...] Guthrie {{was hired as a}} co-producer, but was initially unaware of Ezrin's role: [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> as a hot young producer...When we arrived, I think we both felt we'd been booked to do the same job." [...] The early sessions at Britannia Row were emotionally charged, as Ezrin, Guthrie and Waters each had strong ideas about the direction the album would take. Relations within the band were at a low ebb, and Ezrin's role expanded to that of an intermediary between Waters {{and the rest of the}} band. [...] As Britannia Row was initially regarded as inadequate for The Wall the band upgraded much of its equipment, and by March another set of demos were complete. However, their former relationship with NWG placed them at risk of bankruptcy, and they were advised to leave the UK by no later than 6April 1979, for a minimum of one year. As non-residents they would pay no UK taxes during that time, and within a month all four members and their families had left. Waters moved to Switzerland, Mason to France, and Gilmour and Wright to the Greek Islands. Some equipment from Britannia Row was relocated in Super Bear Studios near Nice. [...] Gilmour and Wright were each familiar with the studio and enjoyed its atmosphere, having recorded there during the production of their solo albums. While Wright and Mason lived at the studio, Waters and Gilmour stayed in nearby houses. Mason later moved into Waters's villa near Vence, while Ezrin stayed in Nice.|$|E
500|$|During her childhood, Madonna was {{inspired}} by actors, later saying, [...] "I loved Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe. They were all incredibly funny... and I <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> in them... my girlishness, my knowingness and my innocence." [...] Her [...] "Material Girl" [...] music video recreated Monroe's look in the song [...] "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend", from the film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953). She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Lombard, {{in preparation for the}} film Who's That Girl. The video for [...] "Express Yourself" [...] (1989) {{was inspired}} by Fritz Lang's silent film Metropolis (1927). The video for [...] "Vogue" [...] recreated the style of Hollywood glamour photographs, in particular those by Horst P. Horst, and imitated the poses of Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard, and Rita Hayworth, while the lyrics referred to many of the stars who had inspired her, including Bette Davis, described by Madonna as an idol. However, Madonna's film career has been largely received negatively by the film critic community. Stephanie Zacharek, critic for Time magazine, stated that, [...] " [...] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and it's tough to watch, because she's clearly trying her damnedest." [...] According to biographer Andrew Morton, [...] "Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism, but privately she is deeply hurt." [...] After the box office bomb Swept Away (2002), Madonna vowed that she would never again act in a film, hoping her repertoire as a bad actress would never be discussed again. In 2016, a career retrospective titled Body of Work was shown at New York's Metrograph hall, to [...] "showcase Madonna's calculated, cohesive canon" [...] according to The Guardians Nigel M Smith. He also explained in an article for the newspaper that the singer's film career suffered mostly due to lack of proper material supplied to her, and given a chance [...] " [...] could steal a scene for all the right reasons".|$|E
2500|$|Cartwright said, [...] "When I was younger, I <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> as a batting all-rounder, {{and then}} I started {{taking a few}} wickets and people started saying, ‘’Oh you’re a bowling all-rounder’’ because I was out of form with my batting. So it was quite hard {{to try to keep}} the idea of myself as a batting all-rounder in my own mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The worst moment – {{not just}} of my {{adolescence}} but of my life – was the day they took off the bandages and I <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> in the mirror. I cried for hours ... It made me very unsettled. It really mucked me around badly, not {{to the point of}} being psychiatrically impaired but it did me a lot of harm in terms of stability and the capacity to concentrate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lansman {{was brought}} up in an Orthodox Jewish family in Southgate, north London. He was a pupil at the {{independent}} Highgate School from 1970 to 1975. [...] He first visited Israel when he was 16: [...] "I worked on a kibbutz in the Negev and my aunt lived in Beersheba. [...] It was actually a very politicising experience. When I did my bar mitzvah I <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> as a Zionist and I think after I went there I felt it less. [...] I was more interested in the kibbutz and what I liked about it was the pioneering spirit, the sense of community and radicalism of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{returned}} to Chicago {{to live with}} her parents and started dancing at the Club Rendevouz in Calumet City, Illinois, where she was known as Galatea, [...] "the Statue that Came to Life." [...] She was offered a raise to become a stripper. [...] After singer Elvis Presley saw her perform at Chicago's Follies Theater, the two began a romantic relationship that some reports say ended in a marriage proposal she declined. She eventually became a successful exotic dancer, traveling from city to city. She credited Lloyd with giving her the confidence to pursue a career in show business: [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> as an ugly child. Mr. Lloyd said, 'You have such a symmetrical face. The camera loves your face...You should be seen.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Japanese {{had their}} own files on Sukarno and the Japanese {{commander}} in Sumatra approached him with respect, wanting to use him to organise and pacify the Indonesians. Sukarno {{on the other hand}} wanted to use the Japanese to gain independence for Indonesia: [...] "The Lord be praised, God showed me the way; in that valley of the Ngarai I said: Yes, Independent Indonesia can only be achieved with Dai Nippon...For the first time in all my life, I <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> in the mirror of Asia." [...] In July 1942, Sukarno was sent back to Jakarta, where he re-united with other nationalist leaders recently released by the Japanese, including Mohammad Hatta. There, he met the Japanese commander General Hitoshi Imamura, who asked Sukarno and other nationalists to galvanise support from Indonesian populace to aid Japanese war effort.|$|E
2500|$|Shore {{was born}} in Toronto, Canada, to Henry and Charlotte Shore. She was the {{youngest}} of seven children. She was drawn to both painting and nature at a young age, remarking [...] "I was on my way home from school and <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> reflected in a puddle. It was the first time I had seen my image completely surrounded by nature, and I suddenly had an overwhelming sense of belonging to it—of actually being part of every tree and flower. I was filled with a desire to tell what I felt through painting." [...] Shore's mother supported Shore's artistic ambitions, but advised her to learn practical matters as well. After taking a domestic education class, at the age of 15, Shore began studying painting with the Canadian Impressionist Laura Muntz Lyall. Her works at this time are mostly genre scenes and thus conform to subject matter that would have been popular in Toronto's traditional art scene during the period.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrical {{themes of}} Currents centre on {{personal}} transition and growing older. Parker's lyrics {{on the album}} are entirely autobiographical. His vocals are clearer and less affected than in prior Tame Impala releases, which is partially owed to him having more pride in his lyrics; he said he {{hoped it would be}} easy for listeners to understand them. Parker considered the primary theme of the album to be a [...] "deep feeling of transition in your psyche," [...] or, in a broad sense, fully entering adulthood. He began learning about the concept of the Saturn return halfway through the recording process, which explained his feelings of reflection. He said, [...] "I was halfway through making the album when I heard about it, and it gave what I was doing a lot more meaning; suddenly things made a lot more sense." [...] Accordingly, on the album his reaction to transition is acceptance, exemplified by the opening song, [...] "Let It Happen". Parker also felt buying the home where he recorded Currents [...] "really changed my perspective about where I <b>saw</b> <b>myself,</b> like a place that I belonged." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Impossible!" [...] Cuthbert exclaimed, [...] "the firing {{has been}} heavy, but no heavier than usual, and {{although}} the village is knocked to pieces, as I <b>saw</b> for <b>myself</b> yesterday, no great harm was done to the bastions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't deny it, sir," [...] roared the Doctor. [...] "Don't add lies, sir, to {{your other}} infamy. I <b>saw</b> you <b>myself,</b> sir. I <b>saw</b> {{you from the}} Dean's garden. I saw you kissing the hand of that infernal painted---" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There's no gamer {{man on the}} list, sir, than Noah James, the guardsman," [...] said Harrison. [...] "I <b>saw</b> him <b>myself</b> fight fifty rounds {{after his}} jaw had been cracked in three places. If Wilson could beat him, Wilson will go far." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>saw</b> it <b>myself.</b> I've {{lived in}} the city so long that no one can fool me with {{counterfeit}} money. I can tell it in two looks, Ingua. So I'd rather have a nice new bill than ten clumsy silver dollars and I made the trade myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the door}} of the {{infirmary}} the Governor met us. [...] "1430," [...] he said to me, in a very kind voice, [...] "you have behaved most admirably.
