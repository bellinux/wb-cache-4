50|$|Charles F. Brannock (May 16, 1903 - November 22, 1992) was the {{inventor}} and manufacturer {{of the familiar}} Brannock Device for measuring overall length, width, and heel-to-ball length of the foot. Brannock, proprietor of the successful Park-Brannock Shoe Store in Syracuse, New York, developed the device in 1925. The instrument was a <b>sales</b> <b>aid,</b> but by ensuring more accurate fittings, the device also helped his customers alleviate or avoid foot problems due to ill-fitting shoes. Brannock also developed specially calibrated devices for the various branches of the military, which issued millions of boots and shoes to servicemen, especially during World War II. Though there were competing measuring devices on the market, the Brannock Device quickly became the industry standard and is still used in shoe stores all over the world.|$|E

In terms of the Slovak Republic, production of public value in the field of animal husbandry in the field of agro-biodiversity and agrarian cultural heritage maintenance in rural areas is also entrusted to professional self-governing institutions and breeding organizations besides state institutions. Within the European perspectives, it is the ELBARN — European Livestock Breeds Ark and Rescue Net which focuses on this issue.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{phenomena}} of the globalization of commerce has been the internationalisation of goods and brands. A set of diverse practices and processes, including the transformation of transport infrastructure and logistics and the virtualisation of money, have enabled both producers (e. g., goods manufacturers) and sellers (e. g., wholesalers, supermarkets) to massively extend supply chains, to globally expand their markets, and to increase their turnover and profits. A key technology in improving the efficiency and productivity of logistical organisation and operation has been development of sophisticated identification systems that overcome the anonymity of manufactured products by assigning unique numerical identifiers – digital thumbprints - to material products. These identification systems allow products to be effectively and unambiguously processed, shipped and traced through complex logistical networks, to monitor <b>sales,</b> <b>aid</b> account management, refine supply chains and inform marketing strategies. Conceptually they have two distinct components, first an agreed allocation of unique id code numbers and, second, an agreed media to physical store the code. The most obvious manifestation of this technology for product identification and tracking are the parallel black and white printed stripes of barcodes...|$|E

5000|$|In {{marketing}} and sales, marketing collateral is sometimes considered {{the collection of}} media used to support the sales of a product or service. Historically, the term [...] "collateral" [...] specifically referred to brochures or sell sheets developed as sales support tools. These <b>sales</b> <b>aids</b> are intended to make the sales effort easier and more effective. The brand of the company usually presents itself by way of its collateral to enhance its brand through a consistent message and other media, and must use a balance of information, promotional content, and entertainment.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Sales</b> <b>aids</b> (for example, the {{inclusion}} of luxury trim features, such as leather surfaces, audio systems, anti-theft systems), even where such accommodations are made, are generally barely {{within the limits of}} government requirements for sale to consumers, to minimize reduction in performance. Such accommodations are often reversible, so that production vehicles can be modified to racing trim. A common example of this process is the exhaust system, often modified in the production vehicle to meet legal requirements in the jurisdictions where the vehicle is sold. Since most production-based racing series allow some level of modification, including the removal of exhaust systems that reduce emissions at the cost of engine performance, vehicles that were produced and sold primarily to meet the homologation guidelines of a particular series are often designed for easy modification of such components.|$|R

50|$|The American Hellenic Institute {{was created}} on August 1, 1974, by Eugene Rossides in {{response}} to the Turkish occupation of Cyprus. The Institute argued that Turkey had violated the US Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and Foreign Military Sales Act, in that Turkish forces were purportedly using American weapons. They called upon Henry Kissinger, who would be a perennial obstacle to the AHI's goals, to condemn Turkey and to deny it further <b>sales</b> and <b>aid</b> until all Turkish troops were withdrawn from the soil of Cyprus. This petition was denied, but under continued pressure from AHI, Congress decided on an arms embargo toward Turkey. In December 1974, an AHI-sponsored $25 million Congressional aid package to Cyprus was approved.|$|R
