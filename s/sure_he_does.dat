25|$|At {{election}} {{time it is}} just political suicide to try to defend the United States... I think on the whole people in the other American Republics understand and support us, but it isn't good politics to say so at {{election time}}. We are a sort of punching bag during elections. Everybody likes to take a swing at us, and makes <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> every time you say something.|$|E
500|$|In {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Speak Now", Swift narrates about {{crashing}} her former love's wedding in attempt to win him back. The opening lines acknowledge that, although out of character, Swift is {{still in love with}} her ex-boyfriend and wants to make <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not marry the wrong girl. Throughout the song's verses, Swift sneaks in the wedding and describes her observations, such as the bride-to-be's bearing of a poofy wedding gown, her cumulative family, and an organist playing [...] "Bridal Chorus". In [...] "Speak Now"'s refrains, Swift pleads her ex-boyfriend to not say his vows in order to run away with her. The bridge has Swift responding to the priest's calling of [...] "Speak now or forever hold your peace" [...] before repeating the opening lines. The last refrain is altered, with Swift narrating from the groom's perspective and inform Swift they will indeed run away together.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene of Act 2, Fleance meets his father, who asks him to take his sword and tells him he is {{reluctant}} {{to go to bed}} due to the [...] "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" [...] On Macbeth's approach, however, Banquo demands the sword be returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king. Doing so would make the throne more available for Fleance, and would fulfill the Three Witches' prophecy that his sons would become kings. Since Banquo's good nature is revolted by these thoughts, he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not act on them. Still, he is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands their return. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams {{have nothing to do with}} him killing the king, but that they have revealed to him Macbeth's bloody nature. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night, but when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had these dark dreams about Macbeth, takes back his sword as a precaution. In any case, this scene adds to the dark, uncertain, unsettling tone of the play. Fleance and his father are not even certain of what time it is throughout, as Fleance says when asked at the beginning of the scene [...] "The moon is down; I have not heard the clock." ...|$|E

60|$|OLIVER. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> The way he suns himself here--like a cat purring in his luxuriation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] I said. [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>He</b> <b>does!</b> He loves {{every living}} thing. Even sinful men. How much more the animals, that cannot sin!" ...|$|E
60|$|MISS D. Oh, do be sympathetic, Minnie! I'm <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> At least I {{would be}} {{sure if he}} wasn't always riding with that odious Mrs. Hagan.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, no,' said Uncle Bat, 'I'm <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not; nor <b>he</b> won't long at the Admiralty either, I {{can tell}} them that. But where's Gertrude?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's strange," [...] {{returned}} Sam, [...] "I have seldom {{spoken to}} the man. Are you <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not send you for some one else--one of his mess-mates?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Robert, how can {{you talk}} so? I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not cry more than other children. Nurse says {{he is the best}} child she ever knew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> He {{desired to}} see baby, {{and he wants}} you, nurse. Only mind you command yourself--don't say a word you can help--do nothing to agitate him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense! He {{does not}} care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Harry {{can talk}} nothing but sailors' language," [...] said Flora, [...] "and I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not learn that of Mr. Ernescliffe. You never hear slang from him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No {{one knows}} it. Don't look towards me; look towards him. He will turn {{his face in}} a moment. No one knows it, but I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> You are?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gone {{north of}} Charles Town," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "that's bad, bedad, that's very bad. You are <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not sail southward?" [...] he asked of {{the captain of}} the brig.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why to be <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does!</b> And, oh, let me {{tell you}} something! Dora {{told me that he was}} terribly angry over having been sent to Chicago on a wild-goose chase." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I have,--but I {{have seen}} no one {{belonging}} to him. Don't {{you understand what}} I mean? I feel all at sea about him. I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not mean any harm." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{received}} {{a very kind}} letter from Godwin, in which {{he says that he}} never thinks of you but with a brother's feeling of love and expectation. Indeed, I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not. Had <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so {{it could}} not have been found among Mr. Usbech's papers; for, as far as I remember, the poor man never {{attended}} to any business after that day." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{read the}} letter three times to be <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not mistake the {{delightful}} import. Then he rang the bell with a vivacity which had not characterised him for many a month.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> {{very well}} as he is for all these years," [...] she said, [...] "and {{if he could have}} a voice in the matter, I'm quite <b>sure</b> that <b>he</b> would prefer his daughters' {{education}} to his own removal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> I {{have seen}} {{as much as}} that myself, and I think I know some one with whom he likes to dance." [...] And the mother gave the {{daughter}} a loving little squeeze.|$|E
6000|$|... "To be <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> I {{will assist}} you," [...] {{answered}} the former teacher readily, with a malicious gleam in his fishy eyes. [...] "I {{wish you had}} all three boys here, to tar them with the same brush." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Dick," [...] she said, [...] "there's {{not much}} comfort in that. Look at poor Bobby Surcingle, look at Oliver Semples and Victor Medallion; {{you could n't}} have better families. But if you 're <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> n't drink! Algy 'll laugh, of course; that does n't matter--he laughs at everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DID he love her?" [...] {{said the}} Phantom, echoing his contemplative tone. [...] "I think <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> once. I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> Better had {{she loved him}} less--less secretly, less dearly, from the {{shallower}} depths of a more divided heart!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm pretty <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> {{although}} <b>he</b> didn't ask any questions. He {{knew about}} the robbery, and he knew well enough that I didn't have any three hundred dollars of my own to give him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> I wish I'd known him. We {{need to know}} {{men like}} that in this pink-frosting playing at living we have in cities," [...] Claire said sweetly--not to Milt but to Jeff.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not," [...] said Clara. Belton sat silent, {{with his}} eyes fixed upon the table, and with a dark frown upon his brow. He did long to quarrel with Captain Aylmer; but was still anxious, if it might be possible, to save himself from what he knew would be a transgression.|$|E
6000|$|... "All men {{who enter}} the forest are," [...] {{answered}} the oriole, positively. [...] "For they only come here to murder and destroy those who are helpless before their power, but have never harmed them in the least. If God loves the birds, as I am <b>sure</b> <b>He</b> <b>does,</b> why do you suppose He made their ferocious enemies, the men?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{not mean}} that, Mr. Hawtrey,' Danvers laughed, 'though {{it may be}} that the action is {{expressive}} of a passing doubt in his mind, or rather of his perceiving some point that is unfavourable to the cause he is retained to defend. I hope you have come here to say that you agree with our view in the matter.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not the appointment," [...] said Eleanor. [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not decline the appointment. But he {{said that}} he would not agree--that is, that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not like the scheme about the schools and the {{services}} and all that. I am quite <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> never said that he wished to refuse the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did Dobbin {{kill the}} man who killed Papa?" [...] Georgy said. [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> or <b>he</b> would if he could have caught him, wouldn't he, Mother? When I'm in the Army, won't I hate the French?--that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|That is what <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{to defeat}} it. In the House of Representatives {{he and his}} friends {{furnished}} some twenty votes, and the Republicans furnished ninety odd. Now, who was it that did the work? [A voice: [...] "Douglas."] Why, yes, Douglas did it? To be <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did!</b> ...|$|R
