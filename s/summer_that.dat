5|$|The papacy intervened {{once again}} to try to produce a last-minute peace deal, {{resulting}} in a fresh conference at La Ferté-Bernard in 1189.

5|$|After a May 23 neck surgery, Manning {{could not}} use the Colts' {{facilities}} for practice and workouts due to the NFL lockout. Reluctant to have witnesses to his recovery, he used the Colorado Rockies baseball team's trainers at Coors Field in Denver. Manning was unable to complete his throwing motion, and his arm strength had significantly diminished. Based on an MRI, doctors told him in the late <b>summer</b> <b>that</b> he needed spinal fusion surgery and that at his age they could not guarantee {{his return to the}} NFL. On September 7, the Colts officially ruled Manning out for the season opener against Houston, ending his consecutive starts streak of 208 games (227 including playoffs); the team signed Kerry Collins out of retirement and named him interim starting quarterback. After seeking other opinions, Manning had the second surgery on September 8.|$|E
5|$|The poorer {{people were}} also {{alarmed by the}} {{contagion}} and some left the city, {{but it was not}} easy for them to abandon their accommodation and livelihoods for an uncertain future elsewhere. Before exiting through the city gates, they were required to possess a certificate of good health signed by the Lord Mayor and these became increasingly difficult to obtain. As time went by and the numbers of plague victims rose, people living in the villages outside London began to resent this exodus and were no longer prepared to accept townsfolk from London, with or without a certificate. The refugees were turned back, were not allowed to pass through towns and had to travel across country, and were forced to live rough on what they could steal or scavenge from the fields. Many died in wretched circumstances of starvation and thirst in the hot <b>summer</b> <b>that</b> was to follow.|$|E

25|$|Though the old trekvaart {{is closed}} for water traffic today, thanks to these early rail developments, {{it is still}} {{possible}} to travel by boat from Amsterdam to Haarlem, via the ringvaart or the North Sea Canal.

The creation of new land in the Haarlemmermeer from 1852 onwards, meant that the city could no longer refresh the water in its canals using the Spaarne river. The increase in industry made the water quality even worse, and in 1859 the Oude Gracht, a city canal, stank so badly in the <b>summer,</b> <b>that</b> it was filled in to create a new street called the Gedempte Oude Gracht.|$|E
