5|$|The {{species was}} listed as {{vulnerable}} in 1996 and endangered as recently as 1988. Most monitored stocks have rebounded {{since the end of}} commercial whaling. In the North Atlantic <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> believed to be approaching prehunting levels. However, the species is considered endangered in some countries, including the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{right whale}} spends the summer months in the far Southern Ocean feeding, probably close to Antarctica. It migrates north in winter for breeding, and can be seen around the coasts of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay. Since hunting of the {{southern right whale}} ceased, <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> estimated to have grown by 7% a year. The South American, South African and Australasian groups apparently intermix very little, if at all, because of the strong fidelity of mothers to their feeding and calving grounds. The mother passes these instincts to her calves.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pinniped}} {{continue to be}} harvested. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals allows limited hunting of crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. However, Weddell seal hunting is prohibited between September and February if the animal is over one year of age, to ensure breeding <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant seals, Ross seals and Antarctic fur seals. The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents {{argue that it is}} irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.|$|E
50|$|Another common way for {{accounting}} for treasury <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> the par value method. In the par value method, when the <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> purchased {{back from the}} market, the books will reflect the action as a retirement of the shares. Therefore, common <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> debited and treasury <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> credited. However, when the treasury <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> resold back to the market the entry in the books {{will be the same}} as the cost method.|$|R

5|$|Subsistence crops {{grown in}} the country include matoke (green bananas), which occupy {{more than a third}} of the country's farmland, potatoes, beans, sweet potatoes, cassava, wheat and maize. Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with the high altitudes, steep slopes and {{volcanic}} soils providing favourable conditions. Reports, have established that more than 400,000 Rwandans, make their living from coffee plantation. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Rwanda vulnerable to shifts in their prices. Animals raised in Rwanda include cows, goats, sheep, pigs, chicken, and rabbits, with geographical variation in the numbers of each. Production systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive dairy farms around Kigali. Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-quality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary services are major constraints that restrict output. Fishing takes place on the country's lakes, but <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> very depleted, and live fish are being imported in an attempt to revive the industry.|$|E
5|$|The California {{sea lion}} ranges {{along the western}} coast and islands of North America, from {{southeast}} Alaska to central Mexico. Mitochondrial DNA sequences in 2009 have identified five distinct California sea lion populations: the U.S. or Pacific Temperate stock, the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and the Southern, Central, and Northern Gulf of California stocks. The U.S. stock breeds mainly in the Channel Islands, although some breeding sites may be established in northern California, and females are now commonly found there. The Western Baja California stock mainly breeds near Punta Eugenia and at Isla Santa Margarita. The above-mentioned <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> separated by the Ensenada Front. The stocks of the Gulf of California live in the shallow waters of the north (Northern stock), the tidal islands near the center (Central stock), and {{the mouth of the}} bay (Southern stock). The stock status of the sea lions at the deep waters of the central bay has not been analyzed.|$|E
5|$|WHO first {{recommended}} {{destruction of}} the virus in 1986 and later set the date of destruction to be 30 December 1993. This was postponed to 30 June 1999. Due to resistance from the U.S. and Russia, in 2002 the World Health Assembly agreed to permit the temporary retention of the virus stocks for specific research purposes. Destroying existing stocks would reduce the risk involved with ongoing smallpox research; the <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> not needed {{to respond to a}} smallpox outbreak. Some scientists have argued that the stocks may be useful in developing new vaccines, antiviral drugs, and diagnostic tests; however, a 2010 review by a team of public health experts appointed by WHO concluded that no essential public health purpose is served by the U.S. and Russia continuing to retain virus stocks. The latter view is frequently supported in the scientific community, particularly among veterans of the WHO Smallpox Eradication Program.|$|E

30|$|Site-level {{estimates}} of ΔC and ΔC 2 <b>stocks</b> and <b>were</b> calculated three ways. First, inventory- based site estimates ΔC and ΔC 2 <b>stocks</b> <b>were</b> calculated as an arithmetic mean of ground plots at each site. Second, ΔC 2 <b>stocks</b> <b>were</b> calculated with the K-MSN prediction. Third, and finally, ΔC 2 <b>stocks</b> <b>were</b> calculated with the K-MSN prediction weighted by flux footprint probability density.|$|R
25|$|The salmon {{species in}} Alaska (chinook, coho, pink, sockeye, and chum) {{generally}} produce good harvest, though some <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> declining. Up to 1977, foreign fishing controlled the groundfish fisheries in Alaska (apart from Pacific halibut).|$|E
25|$|Overfishing {{occurs when}} fish <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> over-exploited to below {{acceptable}} levels; eventually the fish populations {{will no longer}} be able to sustain themselves. This can lead to resource depletion, reduced biological growth, and low biomass levels.|$|E
25|$|Ramsey {{recommends}} {{investors to}} hold all their investments in stock mutual funds, with no bonds, {{which has been}} criticized as <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> more volatile than bonds. Ramsey recommends that retirees withdraw 8% of their retirement each year.|$|E

25|$|Similar to bonds, {{preferred}} <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> {{rated by}} the major credit-rating companies. The rating for preferreds is generally lower, since preferred dividends do not carry the same guarantees as interest payments from bonds and they are junior to all creditors.|$|E
25|$|Transboundary <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> {{fish stocks}} that {{range in the}} EEZs {{of at least two}} countries. Straddling stocks, on the other hand, range both within an EEZ {{as well as in the}} high seas, outside any EEZ. A stock can be both transboundary and straddling.|$|E

25|$|When <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> rising (a bull market), {{the belief}} that further rises are {{probable}} gives investors an incentive to buy (positive feedback—reinforcing the rise, see also stock market bubble and momentum investing); but the increased price of the shares, and the knowledge {{that there must be}} a peak after which the market falls, ends up deterring buyers (negative feedback—stabilizing the rise).|$|E
