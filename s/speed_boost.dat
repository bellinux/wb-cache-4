5|$|Speeders have a boost meter, {{showing how}} much fuel is {{available}} for the onboard <b>speed</b> <b>boost.</b> Although the boost provides greater speeds and acceleration than the standard throttle, it also increases the speeder's heat levels. Designated booster load zones along the track replenish the meter, and a super boost power-up is available which doubles the potency of the boost.|$|E
5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} in the arena, {{the amount of}} safe space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness. The player character can move at high speed and jump to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and jump height. The player can gain a <b>speed</b> <b>boost</b> by strafing while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E
5|$|In Mario Kart DS, a kart is able {{to draft}} behind another kart to gain a <b>speed</b> <b>boost</b> momentarily, a feature that was also {{previously}} used in the 1996 video game Mario Kart 64. Mario Kart DS places a stronger focus on the feature and once again provides a visual cue when a kart is drafting. In an interview, Konno notes that they included tracks from previous Mario Kart games into Mario Kart DS so that players who played the original Super Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System would feel {{more familiar with the}} DS iteration of the series.|$|E
25|$|Players race in {{vehicles}} on numerous courses while navigating past obstacles. While {{the game is}} a 2D racer, its Mode 7 graphical effect allows the track to be scaled and rotated around the vehicle to simulate a 3D environment. Climax let players store rewarded <b>speed</b> <b>boosts</b> to use with energy-draining <b>speed</b> <b>boosts.</b> Energy {{is a reflection of}} the craft's health, and can be restored by driving over specific areas on the track.|$|R
50|$|In {{the golf}} segment's racing levels, the trio race their golf cart {{through the course}} they just played, {{shooting}} Frat Aliens with a bazooka, collecting <b>speed</b> <b>boosts,</b> and passing check points toward the goal of completing three laps {{to move on to}} the next level.|$|R
5000|$|There are <b>speed</b> <b>boosts</b> {{throughout}} the levels, {{either in the}} shape of little orbs which gives you a short burst of speed or as bottles or pools of [...] "Enerjuice" [...] which fills up a blue meter and can be used whenever the player chooses.|$|R
5|$|In {{the world}} of Chocobo Racing, Magic Stones are {{scattered}} throughout each course, and can {{be picked up by}} the player by driving through them. Magic Stones can also be stolen from opponent players by bumping into another player. The player can then activate the Magic Stone for some special effect. Activating a Haste Stone, for example, gives the character a short <b>speed</b> <b>boost.</b> In some Magic Stones, the power of the stone increases if more than one of the same stone is picked up by the player. Each stone is represented by a corresponding symbol on the racetrack, while stones marked with question marks represent random Magic Stones, which grant the player either a Haste Stone, Fire Stone, Ice Stone, Thunder Stone, Minimize Stone, Reflect Stone, Doom Stone, or Ultima Stone.|$|E
5|$|The Wipeout {{games are}} {{a series of}} futuristic racers which involve players {{piloting}} anti-gravity ships through various forms of races. The series is known for its extreme speed, range of electronic dance music soundtracks, and consequential difficulty. Power-ups {{come in the form of}} offensive or defensive weaponry, ranging from machine guns, missiles, rockets, to energy shields, auto pilots, and mines. Power-ups are usually collected by flying over different coloured pads on race tracks. <b>Speed</b> <b>boost</b> pads also feature prominently on race tracks: once flown over, the player receives a short momentous boost. Every ship featured in a game is owned by a different racing corporation (collectively referred to as 'teams' in-game) although the number of teams and ships will vary throughout the games. Every ship has different characteristics, for example each ship will vary in handling, thrust, maximum speed and shield strength. Each ship is equipped with a compulsory shield which absorbs damage sustained during a race; energy is lost whenever the player's ship collides or is hit by weapons fire. If the shield runs out, the ship in question will explode and the player is consequently eliminated from the race.|$|E
5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown is {{a racing}} video game with arcade-style {{gameplay}} that emphasises dangerous and fast-paced driving. The game features standard circuit races which {{take place on}} carriageways and city streets populated with traffic. The Single Race mode pits the player against five AI opponents in a single or multiple lap race. During a race, boost, which is earned by acts of reckless driving such as drifting around corners, near misses with traffic, and driving in oncoming lanes, {{can be used to}} rapidly increase a car's <b>speed.</b> <b>Boost</b> can be used immediately in Burnout 3, unlike previous Burnout games which required the boost meter to be full. The quickest method for earning boost is a Takedownâ€”a central mechanic introduced in this instalment of the series. A Takedown involves shunting opposing vehicles until they crash. Each one fills the boost meter and can provide an additional boost segment, causing the meter to extend up to four times its initial size. Ramming opponents will cause them to behave more aggressively in return; their level of hostility is indicated by a coloured arrow above their vehicle. When the player crashes or is taken out by an opponent, boost is lost and a bonus boost segment is withdrawn. During the crash sequence, a slow-motion mode called Impact Time can be activated. In Impact Time, the Aftertouch mechanic can be used to manoeuvre the wrecked car chassis into an opponent to get a Takedown, which acts as recovery move by negating the penalty of crashing.|$|E
5000|$|As {{is their}} custom {{to do with}} nearly {{everything}} they make, id Software released the source of , their QuakeC compiler, along with the original QuakeC code in 1996. Modified versions soon sprung up, including Jonathan Roy's [...] and Ryan [...] "FrikaC" [...] Smith's FrikQCC. These added functionality, optimizations, and compiling <b>speed</b> <b>boosts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Musou Token {{which enables}} {{the use of}} Musou Rage have been removed. It is instead {{replaced}} by Tome item drop which allows the use of unique special attacks. There are five types of attacks; Swift Attack (increases the player's stats), Volley (launches waves of arrows), Fire (sets eruptions of fire), True <b>Speed</b> (<b>boosts</b> the player's <b>speed),</b> and Rockfall (launches giant boulders from above).|$|R
50|$|Model VX-100 was {{expected}} to have NB ion <b>speed</b> <b>boosting</b> efficiency of 80%. Instead, efficiency losses emerged from the conversion of DC electric current to radio frequency power and the energy consumption of the auxiliary equipment for the superconducting magnet. By comparison, 2009 state-of-the-art, proven ion engine designs such as NASA's High Power Electric Propulsion (HiPEP) operated at 80% total thruster/PPU energy efficiency.|$|R
25|$|Car modification: Most {{automobiles}} in {{the game}} can be modified and upgraded at various garages. All car mods are strictly visual apart from the stereo system and nitrous oxide upgrade which increases bass and gives the car a <b>speed</b> <b>boost</b> when activated respectively; and hydraulics, which lowers the car's height by default and allows the player to control {{various aspects of the}} car's suspension. Other common modifications include paintjobs, rims, body kits, side skirts, bumpers and spoilers.|$|E
25|$|The other {{component}} of Agrippa's sections {{in the game}} involves chariot racing. In this mode, Agrippa must race against other chariots, and can win by either crossing the finish line first, or eliminating all of his opponents, either by killing them or destroying their chariots. Agrippa can whip his horses to give a <b>speed</b> <b>boost,</b> but doing do drains the horses stamina gauge. When it is empty, the horses can only run at normal speed, until the gauge begins to fill up again. Agrippa can eliminate opponents by driving alongside their chariots and attacking them or by forcing their chariots into obstacles. Longer weapons {{can be found on}} the track itself, carried by slaves.|$|E
25|$|Mario Kart 8s new {{features}} include anti-gravity racing, in which {{certain parts of}} a track can allow racers to drive on walls and ceilings. During these sections, players can bump into other racers or special bumpers to trigger a Spin Boost, which gives them an extra <b>speed</b> <b>boost.</b> New characters include the Koopalings, Baby Rosalina, and Pink Gold Peach. New items include the Boomerang Flower, which can be thrown to attack players, the Piranha Plant, which attacks nearby racers and obstacles, the Crazy Eight, which gives the user eight items, and the Super Horn, {{which can be used}} both to attack nearby opponents and defend against items, including the previously nearly unavoidable Spiny Shell. The game features 32 tracks, with an additional 16 later released as downloadable content (DLC).|$|E
5000|$|The Sorcerer was {{successful}} in Australia {{as a result of}} strong promotion by its exclusive agent Dick Smith Electronics, though there was price resistance as it was considered beyond the means of most hobbyists. The Sorcerer Computer Users group of Australia (SCUA) actively supported the Sorcerer long after Exidy discontinued it, with RAM upgrades, <b>speed</b> <b>boosts,</b> the [...] "80-column card", and even a replacement monitor program, SCUAMON.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a high <b>speed</b> <b>boosted</b> CMOS differential logic which is applicable in Ripple Carry Adders. The proposed logic operating with supply voltage approaching the MOS threshold voltage. The logic style improves switching <b>speed</b> by <b>boosting</b> the gate-source voltage of transistors along timing critical signal path. It allows a single boosting circuit {{to be shared}} by complementary outputs {{as a result the}} area overhead also minimizes. As compared to the conventional logic gates the EDP (energy delay product) is improved. The test sets of logic gates and adders where designed in tsmc 0. 18 Î¼m of Mentor Graphics EDA tool. The experimental result for Ripple Carry Adders using the proposed logic style revealed that the addition time is reduced as compared with the conventional CMOS circuits...|$|R

25|$|Psyonix had {{previously}} developed Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars in 2008 for the PlayStation 3. That title itself bore out from previous modifications that Psyonix' founder, Dave Hagewood, {{had done for}} Unreal Tournament 2003 by expanding out vehicle-based gameplay that Epic Games had already set {{in place in the}} engine into a new game mode called Onslaught. For this, Hagewood was hired as a contractor by Epic for Unreal Tournament 2004 specifically for incorporating the Onslaught mode as an official part of the game. Hagewood used his experience at Epic to found Psyonix. Among other contract projects, Psyonix worked {{to try to find a}} way to make racing the Unreal vehicles in a physics-based engine enjoyable. They had toyed with several options such as race modes or mazes, but found that when they added a ball to the arena to be pushed by the vehicles, they had hit upon the right formula, which would become Battle-Cars. Further to the success was the addition of the rocket-powered cars; this originally was to be a simple <b>speed</b> <b>boost,</b> but with the physics engine, they were able to have the vehicles fly off and around the arena, furthering the possibilities for gameplay.|$|E
25|$|Rocket League {{gameplay}} {{is largely}} {{the same as}} that of its predecessor Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. Players control a rocket-powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much larger than the cars towards the other team's goal area to score goals, in a way that resembles a soccer game, with elements reminiscent of a demolition derby. Players' cars have the ability to jump to hit the ball while in mid-air. The players can also pick up a <b>speed</b> <b>boost</b> by passing their cars over marked spaces on the field, enabling them to quickly cross the field, use the added momentum to hit the ball, or ram into another player's car to destroy it; in the latter case, the destroyed car respawns moments later. A player may also utilize boost when in the air to propel themselves forward in flight, allowing players to hit the ball in the air. Players can also perform quick dodges, causing their car to do a short jump and spin in a given direction, which can be used to nudge the ball or gain positioning advantage over the other team.|$|E
500|$|A crucial {{maneuver}} in Crash Team Racing is {{the power}} slide; the player executes the slide by holding {{down one of the}} shoulder buttons to perform a hop, and steering before the kart lands. While sliding, the [...] "Turbo Boost Meter" [...] on the lower-right corner of the screen fills up and goes from green to red. At the same time, the exhaust gas from the player's kart turns black. To get a <b>speed</b> <b>boost,</b> the player quickly presses the opposite shoulder button while the Turbo Boost Meter is red. The player can execute three speed boosts in a row during a power slide, with the third <b>speed</b> <b>boost</b> being more powerful than the previous two. If the player waits too long into the power slide for a boost, the kart back-fires and the chance for a <b>speed</b> <b>boost</b> is lost; power sliding for too long causes a spin-out. Aside from power slides, speed boosts can be obtained by gathering [...] when leaping over gaps in the track. The longer the player is in the air, the bigger the <b>speed</b> <b>boost</b> will be when the kart lands.|$|E
5|$|Numerous weapons may {{be picked}} up during a race by flying over different-coloured weapon pads. Yellow pads equip the player with {{offensive}} weaponry to destroy other racers and green pads provide defensive weapons such as mines, shields and <b>speed</b> <b>boosts.</b> Game modes carried over from Wipeout HD include one-on-one races, tournaments, time trials, speed laps, and Zone mode. The latter mode revolves around survival as the player's ship automatically accelerates to extreme speeds.|$|R
5|$|The game {{introduces}} the Batmobile as a drivable vehicle. The bulletproof Batmobile can be {{summoned to the}} player's location while on foot or, if the player is airborne, summoned to meet Batman as he lands. The vehicle features the ability to perform jumps, <b>speed</b> <b>boosts,</b> rotate on the spot, smash through objects like barricades and trees, and fire missiles that can immobilize enemy vehicles. Batman can eject from the Batmobile and immediately begin gliding around Gotham City.|$|R
50|$|Grapple Gun - for {{ascension}} {{of buildings}} at high <b>speeds,</b> to <b>boost</b> gliding ability, disarming criminals {{from a distance}} and opening up heavy doors.|$|R
500|$|Two {{exclusive}} {{features are}} Turbo Mode (previously featured only in Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition) giving the game a 20% <b>speed</b> <b>boost</b> {{and a new}} difficulty mode called Legendary Dark Knight Mode which can display over 100 enemies in some missions at once. Both features return in the [...] release.|$|E
500|$|Players {{can also}} compete in {{multiplayer}} races {{with up to}} six players. [...] The hosting player can adjust options for the race, including the ability to toggle vehicle collisions, give a <b>speed</b> <b>boost</b> to allow slower players to catch up, and set the vehicle performance to normal or tuned. [...] Online leaderboards are also present in the game, divided by game mode, vehicle performance setting, and driving stage.|$|E
500|$|While racing, {{the player}} can accelerate, brake, reverse, {{activate}} Magic Stones, {{or use a}} [...] "special ability" [...] using the game controller's analog stick and buttons. An additional move is the skid, which is executed by simultaneously braking and accelerating into a turn; as the game's cornering technique, the skid {{can be used to}} take sharp turns quickly. If the player skids too sharply, however, a spin out will occur. Before the start of any race, the player's character receives a <b>speed</b> <b>boost</b> if the player accelerates at the correct time during the countdown.|$|E
5|$|Crash Team Racing is {{the fourth}} {{installment}} in the Crash Bandicoot series. The game's story focuses on the efforts of a ragtag team of characters in the Crash Bandicoot series, who must race against the egomaniacal Nitros Oxide to save their planet from destruction. In the game, players can take control of one of fifteen Crash Bandicoot series characters, though only eight are available at first. During the races, offensive and <b>speed</b> <b>boosting</b> power ups {{can be used to}} gain an advantage.|$|R
50|$|The game {{features}} a simplified version of association football, with six players per side and no offsides, throw-ins, or fouls. There {{are many different}} maps for the game all with music and sounds. Teams and stadia within the game are based upon existing LEGO themes. Power-ups, such as <b>speed</b> <b>boosts</b> and shields, spawn randomly on the pitch during play. The game {{features a}} number of modes, such as quick match, exhibition, a knock-out tournament, and training, which doubles {{as a series of}} minigames.|$|R
5000|$|The game retains {{several of}} the new weapons {{introduced}} in Nemesis 2 like [...] "Up Laser", [...] "Fire Blaster" [...] and [...] "Vector Laser" [...] as well as Salamander weapons like [...] "Meteor Laser" [...] and [...] "Screw Laser". This is {{the only game in}} the Nemesis series which visibly keeps track of the number of <b>speed</b> <b>boosts.</b> In order to upgrade the ship's weapons, secret spots must be found, just like the secret stages in Nemesis 2 and the predictions in Salamander.|$|R
500|$|Double Dash is a kart racing {{video game}} in which the player races in a kart against other teams in {{different}} courses. The game screen indicates the current standings in a race, the current speed of the player's kart and incoming weapons. Like in the previous installments, players can pick up item boxes to receive a randomly selected item {{and use it to}} impede the opposition and gain the advantage. Some items, such as shells and bananas, allow the player to hit others to slow them down, while other items, such as the star power-up, render them temporarily invincible to attacks. This is the only game in the series in which instead of one character per kart, there are two: one to drive, and one to use items; and is also the first in the series where players drop their items when hit by a weapon. The powerslide technique, an action that allows the player to drift around turns, has been improved; players can tilt the control stick while drifting to make sparks appear around their kart. If tilted enough, the sparks turn blue, and the player gains a <b>speed</b> <b>boost</b> known as a [...] "mini-turbo". The rocket start, an action that allows the player to gain a <b>speed</b> <b>boost</b> when a race begins is also improved as the Double Dash, which can only be done as a team.|$|E
500|$|Each {{machine has}} an energy meter, which serves two purposes. Firstly, it is a {{measurement}} of the machine's health and is decreased, for example, when the machine hits another racer or {{the side of the}} track. The game introduces the ability to attack other racers by either utilizing a side or spin attack. Secondly, it is a boost meter used for manually boosting, usually starting with the second lap of a race. Energy can be replenished by driving over recharge strips, called [...] "Pit Areas", located at various points around the track. The amount of time spent in these areas is relative to amount of energy regenerated. There are also dash plates around the track that give a <b>speed</b> <b>boost</b> without using up any energy.|$|E
500|$|The game {{takes place}} over six zones, each {{divided into two}} acts. Levels are {{populated}} with Robotnik's robots, called [...] "badniks"; Sonic and Tails can defeat badniks by jumping on them or using the [...] "spin dash" [...] attack, which also gives the character a <b>speed</b> <b>boost.</b> The levels include obstacles and other features such as vertical loops, corkscrews, breakable walls, spikes, water that the player can drown in, and bottomless pits. There is a miniboss fight with one of Robotnik's large, powerful robots {{at the end of}} the first act of each level and a full boss fight with Robotnik {{at the end of the}} second. Reaching a new level saves the game to one of six save slots.|$|E
25|$|Mario Kart Wii is a kart racing game {{featuring}} several {{single and}} multiplayer modes. The players each {{take control of}} one of many selectable Mario franchise characters and participate in races or battles using karts or motorcycles on courses thematically based on locations from the Mario franchise. During gameplay, the player views the action from a third-person perspective that tracks the player from behind his or her kart.
