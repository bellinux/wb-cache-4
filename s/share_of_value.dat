The aim of this paper is to add to this debate and this requires us to critique the current models. The key process that the analysis of power will help to explain is the division of the available revenue stream flowing up the chain from the buyer's customers.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence of denser networks of intermediate input flows between countries suggesting ongoing fragmentation of production chains. But {{to what extent}} is this process mainly regional, taking place between countries within a region, or mainly global, involving countries outside the region? We provide new macro-economic evidence regarding this issue, by extending the Feenstra and Hanson (1999) measure of fragmentation to a multi-country setting. We identify the value chain of a product by the country and industry in which the last stage of production takes place. Based on an input-output model of the global economy we derive the distribution of value added by all countries involved in its production. Using a new dataset of world input-output tables covering forty countries and fourteen manufacturing product groups, we find that in almost all product chains the <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> added outside the country {{is increasing}} since 1995. The <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> added outside the region has been increasing much faster though. These tendencies were only briefly interrupted by the financial crisis in 2008. Based on a cross-entropy measure of fragmentation we find that despite these trends, the scope for further international fragmentation is still large. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{concepts}} of value creation, value capture, and value protection are employed to explain new entry and vertical integration. It is posited that if, at one {{stage of the}} value system, the <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> captured is disproportionally higher than the <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> created, value chain envy will ensue. This value chain envy will result in new entry and vertical integration towards that desirable stage provided that the means of value protection available to the incumbents can be overcome. Within the popular music industries, the value created at the stage of music publishing has diminished steadily {{over the course of}} the 20 th century, but the value captured has remained high. This has triggered value chain envy both inside and outside of the value system. The data presented in this paper show high levels of vertical integration into that stage originating primarily from the stages upstream in the value system, while the level of new entry has been comparatively low. At the same time, the data indicate that the recent introduction of new information communication technologies (ICT) have not significantly affected the levels of new entry and vertical integration into music publishing.
