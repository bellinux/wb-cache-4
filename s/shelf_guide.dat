5000|$|In {{the fourth}} edition of The Record <b>Shelf</b> <b>Guide</b> to Classical CDs & Audio cassettes, Jim Svejda {{wrote that the}} [...] "Piano Sonata of 1990 {{is one of the}} most {{significant}} works in the form since the great Piano Sonata of Elliott Carter." ...|$|E
5000|$|Svejda is {{considered}} by many to be quite frank and subjective in his opinions. In his published Record <b>Shelf</b> <b>Guide,</b> Svejda himself describes the book as [...] "an irreverent, selective and highly opinionated recordings guide of the best classical CDs and audiocassettes." [...] He often has viewpoints that might be considered divergent from those of many other music critics.|$|E
40|$|In the Arctic Ocean, almost 50 % of the {{seafloor}} is underlain by continental shelf. However, the geology of the pre-rift continental crust {{that makes up}} {{the basement of the}} shelf is poorly constrained because it is overlain by thick Cenozoic sedimentary cover. This study explores the available data and methods for mapping the continental bedrock geology beneath the sediments. In a GIS framework, extrapolation of geological map units to the <b>shelf</b> edge was <b>guided</b> by onshore structure and offshore bathymetry. The compilation involved identification of data sources, development of a common legend for pre-rift basement geology, building attributes tables for analysis, and extrapolating geological contacts. As a first-order assessment of mineral resource potential of the continental shelf, permissive tracts for certain mineral deposit types were also identified. The analysis includes a case study of permissive geology for magmatic Ni-Cu deposits in the Taimyr Peninsula in northern Russia...|$|R
40|$|What {{comes after}} "strategic [...] . ?" If you said, "planning," you're not alone. And for many leaders of {{community}} foundations, especially small ones who don't {{have the time}} or money for a big process, anxiety is the feeling that follows. If that's the case, this guide is for you. It invites you to test-drive some activities to bring your current program, operations and  leadership strategies into focus before you decide whether to create a plan or not. It helps you discover ongoing strategic practices and decide whether to keep them or not. If you've already made a strategic plan, but it's languishing on a <b>shelf,</b> this <b>guide</b> will help you refresh it. PART A: Good Strategy Takes Practice (Not Just Planning) PART B: Do Your DiscoveryPART C: Jumpstart Your Strategy NarrativePART D: Bring It TogetherLooking To What's Next As we introduced this guide, we noticed that describing each activity isn't the same as experiencing it as an engaged group. These can't be abstract, dispassionate assessments. We're seeking to create experiences. Similar to a strategic plan, it's important to try these activities [...] not just read about them. This guide aims to guide a strategic process that emerges in an organic, inclusive way. Look through these activities and find something that you think speaks to a place where you're stuck in your foundation. Try it out. Where are you now, where are you stuck, where are some of the places where you might want to be? Start building strategy conversations and exercises into your existing meetings. Slowly, over time, try using different tools to get people more flexible about talking about strategy. And tell us how it's going, so that we can make this guide a living document, too...|$|R
60|$|Unless one is wealthy {{there is}} no use in being a charming fellow. Romance is the {{privilege}} of the rich, not the profession of the unemployed. The poor should be practical and prosaic. It is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating. These are the great truths of modern life which Hughie Erskine never realised. Poor Hughie! Intellectually, we must admit, he was not of much importance. He never said a brilliant or even an ill-natured thing in his life. But then he was wonderfully good-looking, with his crisp brown hair, his clear-cut profile, and his grey eyes. He was as popular with men as he was with women and he had every accomplishment except that of making money. His father had bequeathed him his cavalry sword and a History of the Peninsular War in fifteen volumes. Hughie hung the first over his looking-glass, put the second on a <b>shelf</b> between Ruff's <b>Guide</b> and Bailey's Magazine, and lived on two hundred a year that an old aunt allowed him. He had tried everything. He had gone on the Stock Exchange for six months; but what was a butterfly to do among bulls and bears? He had been a tea-merchant for a little longer, but had soon tired of pekoe and souchong. Then he had tried selling dry sherry. That did not answer; the sherry {{was a little too}} dry. Ultimately he became nothing, a delightful, ineffectual young man with a perfect profile and no profession.|$|R
5000|$|While {{admitting that}} they {{sometimes}} {{have turned out}} excellent recordings, Svejda has been critical of such illustrious musicians as Vladimir Horowitz and Arturo Toscanini, as well as Herbert von Karajan (whom he has excoriated for his alleged Nazi past) and especially Nikolaus Harnoncourt, whom Svejda has called an [...] "incompetent bozo." [...] He tends to favor conductors and musicians who do not follow a printed musical score literally, and his guidebook, The Record <b>Shelf</b> <b>Guide</b> to the Classical Repertoire, often will recommend a controversial recording of a piece (such as Sir Thomas Beecham's 1959 recording of Handel's Messiah), alongside a more traditional one.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers-Portland District (CENWP) has ongoing work {{to improve}} the {{survival}} of juvenile salmonids (smolt) migrating past The Dalles Dam. As part of that effort, a spillwall was constructed to improve juvenile egress through the tailrace downstream of the stilling basin. The spillwall was designed to improve smolt survival by decreasing smolt retention time in the spillway tailrace and the exposure to predators on the spillway <b>shelf.</b> The spillwall <b>guides</b> spillway flows, and hence smolt, more quickly into the thalweg. In this study, an existing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was modified and used to characterize tailrace hydraulics between the new spillwall and the Washington shore for six different total river flows. The effect of spillway flow distribution was simulated for three spill patterns at the lowest total river flow. The commercial CFD solver, STAR-CD version 4. 1, was used to solve the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations together with the k-epsilon turbulence model. Free surface motion was simulated using the volume-of-fluid (VOF) technique. The model results were used in two ways. First, results graphics were provided to CENWP and regional fisheries agency representatives for use and comparison to the same flow conditions at a reduced-scale physical model. The CFD results were very similar in flow pattern to that produced by the reduced-scale physical model but these graphics provided a quantitative view of velocity distribution. During the physical model work, an additional spill pattern was tested. Subsequently, that spill pattern was also simulated in the numerical model. The CFD streamlines showed that the hydraulic conditions {{were likely to be}} beneficial to fish egress at the higher total river flows (120 kcfs and greater, uniform flow distribution). At the lowest flow case, 90 kcfs, it was necessary to use a non-uniform distribution. Of the three distributions tested, splitting the flow evenly between Bay 7 and Bay 8 had hydraulics deemed most beneficial for egress by CENWP fisheries biologists and regional fishery agency representatives. The numerical and physical model results were very similar, building confidence in both hydraulic tools...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. In {{the paper}} it is {{proposed}} to find methods of structural reinforcement of a side frame of a bogie {{in areas of}} stress concentration (the compound zone, {{the corners of the}} pedestal jaw opening, etc.), where, as the experience of operation shows, it is possible the emergence of fatigue cracks. It should avoid a significant increase in weight of the structure and does not cause «overflow» areas with a lot of stress from one portion of the structure to another. Methodology. The stresses in the side frame are determined by finite element modeling. Firstly parts of structure that is subject to be strengthened are detected. At the next stage the possible ways of enhancement are developed (wall thickness increase, change of fillet radii, introduction of additional truss plate, etc.). After which according to the results of simulation the effectiveness of each method is evaluated. Amplification of individual sections of the side frame does not always lead to its hardening as a whole (stress decrease in one place often leads to stress increase in the other one). The further procedure is iterative in nature: best-case changes are entered {{in the design of the}} frame; weakened areas of construction again are revealed and so on, till to the achievement an acceptable level of safety. Findings. Directional iterative search allows finding a combination of local amplification that increasing significantly the strength of structure. Namely, radius of the transition from the column to the support surface and in the openings between the column and the inclined belt up to 40 and 50 mm are increased respectively; truss plate are added between the upper and lower <b>shelf</b> of Triangel <b>guide</b> and on the inner guide of jaw aperture; technological area of the aperture in the column is reduced by one-third. Due to the proposed stresses combination, voltages in construction were reduced by 41 %. Originality. The efficiency of the iterative search procedure of local amplifications combinations in design of the side frame that let significantly increase its strength without a significant increase in weight is presented by scientists. Practical value. Obtained results give the possibility to increase significantly the strength of the side frame in the three-piece truck without any noticeable change in its geometrical and mass characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Since {{this guide}} was first {{published}} the University sector has continued to grow, to become more complex, more resilient and more vulnerable. In the foreword to the first edition I commented upon how City University London, where I was Deputy Vice-Chancellor, had survived a major fire because of the extraordinary efforts of our staff, by some effective planning and by luck. I am now Vice-Chancellor at Kingston University. Were we to have a similar event now we would also survive, as would the other Universities across the country. Survival would again depend upon the extraordinary efforts of staff and upon effective planning. Luck would play a part, {{but it would be}} less than in the past. The diminished role of luck and its partial replacement by planning {{is a testament to the}} vision behind this guide. The importance of planning, of considering the possible vulnerabilities and mitigating them is now far better embedded in our institutions. The training that was developed alongside this guide has spread understanding of the approaches that can be taken to mitigate the impact of a fire, flood, or other event. Universities become more vulnerable as they become more diverse, complex, porous and engaged with multiple constituencies. They become more resilient as they embed learning about risk management and planning for emergencies into their routines. When the unexpected happens it will be unique, for HEI are all unique. However the Guide will help reduce their dependence on luck. Whatever happens a successful outcome will depend upon the extraordinary efforts of people on the ground. The guide will help maximise the benefit from that extraordinary effort. The guide is not a recipe for fulfilment of a management objective by producing an emergency response strategy, that will probably sit (another fire hazard) on a <b>shelf.</b> The <b>guide</b> provides information, advice and resources to help those with responsibilities in developing an emergency response, which should involve the wider institution. It should be used as part of a deliberate programme to shift away from luck to dependence on skilled people with the knowledge of how to develop a robust complex response that may save lives, avoid injury, protect buildings and reputations and enable the institution to carrying on its business. Emergency planning is a concern of everyone, especially senior management teams. The guide supports that wider engagement. This guide has been strongly influenced by those with an estates, emergency response and security point of view; I found it a privilege to chair the group and get to know these unsung members of the University Community who think deeply about their responsibilities and the challenges of maintaining the core functions of the institution in the face of potential disaster. My admiration is in no way diminished several years and an institution later. Their efforts are well worth reading. I would not wish a fire, flood or other disaster on any reader. However we know from letters and comments received that the guide has been helpful. Institutions that have used it and then had an untoward event found the preparation paid off. Use of this guide should mean that you are better prepared, if an event befall your institution. Finally, the guide will continue to be maintained as long as we hear that it has value to the community...|$|R
