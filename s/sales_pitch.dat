5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{are sent}} on {{assignment}} {{to make a}} <b>sales</b> <b>pitch</b> to a client, and are eager to land the sale. However, Danny Cordray (Timothy Olyphant), a rival paper salesman from the very small Osprey company who steals more potential sales away from Dunder Mifflin than anyone, has also arrived for a <b>sales</b> <b>pitch.</b> Dwight also reveals that Danny had a romantic history with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) four years previously. Jim and Dwight call in Michael Scott (Steve Carell), who is ecstatic at getting {{a chance to make}} a sale, to come and try to save them. The company ends up taking Danny's offer, even after Michael promises at-cost paper sales and weekend delivery. The trio leaves the client's office and head back home, defeated.|$|E
5|$|Nancy was favorably {{impressed}} with Houston's land <b>sales</b> <b>pitch,</b> {{but not so}} {{impressed with}} his interest in her daughter. She {{and others in the}} family were concerned about his reputation as a hard-drinking carouser with a proclivity for profanity, who was 26 years older than Margaret and twice married. Several weeks of love letters had been exchanged between Margaret and Houston by the time he proposed marriage that summer of 1839, presenting her with his image carved on a brooch. In an effort to assuage the family's opposition to the union, Houston spent several weeks in the Lea home in Alabama.|$|E

25|$|Despite Convair's <b>sales</b> <b>pitch</b> and the {{anticipated}} {{effectiveness of the}} weapon, the Air Force was unenthusiastic about the concept; aside from the expense of developing the aircraft and weapon, the Sky Scorcher missile also suffered {{from the fact that}} there would be significant effects on the ground below the location of an airburst of a multi-megaton nuclear warhead. As a result, the project was abandoned before any significant work was undertaken.|$|E
25|$|Task Review: First Forte {{built their}} {{campaign}} around comparing the music {{system to a}} larger, classical jukebox, even using the size {{differences between the two}} as part of it, with their overall presentation being viewed as impressive. Meanwhile, Impact suffered major issues throughout the task, as Paul spent less time managing the team and more on directing their TV advert, leaving Saira to give a very vague brief to a graphics designer on what was required from their print ad. Both adverts were deemed poor, with the TV advert hardly showing the product, while their <b>sales</b> <b>pitch</b> failed to improve things, as Sir Alan felt that First Forte's was clearly the better campaign.|$|E
25|$|One example {{involves}} smaller {{enterprises and}} cooperatives attracting {{foreign investment and}} opportunities to sell their wares abroad. One such cooperative, headed by Nurith Alvarez Cravioto, in Hidalgo State consists of rural poor, {{many of whom have}} sent men to the United States to work, and ex-convicts who cannot find employment. They needed an investment of almost $10,000 USD to build workshops and buy equipment. They were unsuccessful getting money from the Hidalgo or Mexican federal sources. However, their case was well known enough that a state politician mentioned them to the secretary of the Japanese embassy in Mexico. The cooperative made a <b>sales</b> <b>pitch</b> to the Japanese embassy, which agreed to fund the cooperative. This effort is hoped to lead to the ability to export the cooperative’s products to Japan.|$|E

500|$|Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, from New London, Wisconsin, set up Wolf River Kennels {{in order}} to save the breed. Numbers held by the kennel fluctuated but at times went up to 132 dogs. He advertised the dogs widely across the country, selling male dogs for $25 and females dogs for $20. Part of a <b>sales</b> <b>pitch</b> that Pfeifer mailed to {{prospective}} dog owners read, [...] "The American Brown Spaniel is distinctively an American production. Hunters have known this type for years and it was through their efforts that this dog was propagated.... For years we have bred only selective stock, breeding for gameness, stability, courage, intelligence, and beauty. They are dogs to admire and trust under all conditions whether in the home circle or in the field with the outdoor man." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of such marketing approach and its effectiveness is hotly debated. Supporters claim that environmental appeals are actually growing in number–the Energy Star label, for example, now appears on 11,000 different companies' models in 38 product categories, from washing machines and light bulbs to skyscrapers and homes. However, despite {{the growth in}} the number of green products, green marketing is on the decline as the primary <b>sales</b> <b>pitch</b> for products. Shel Horowitz, a green marketer for over 30 years and primary author of Guerrilla marketing Goes Green [...] states that to market effectively, green businesses need to market to three different audiences, [...] "deep green," [...] "lazy green," [...] and [...] "nongreen", and that each must be approached differently. Each will have different trigger points that will move them to buy, and for the nongreen audience, marketing effectively usually requires emphasizing product superiority rather than care for the planet.|$|E
500|$|Nebraska proved {{resistant}} to Meeker's <b>sales</b> <b>pitch,</b> and near Brady, the ox Twist died, possibly after eating a poisonous plant. [...] Meeker had to wire home to supporters for money. [...] He hired teams of horses {{to pull the}} wagon on a temporary basis, and an attempt with two cows was not successful. He was able to temporarily yoke Dave with a cow which proved more suitable. [...] At the Omaha Stockyards, Meeker found another ox, which he named Dandy, and broke him in {{on the way to}} Indianapolis, near where Meeker had once lived and [...] by road from Puyallup. Beginning in Nebraska, Meeker began to sell postcards from photos taken on the way—there was then a craze for postcards in the United States. He also arranged for the printing of a book about his 1852 trip, much of which he wrote during noontime halts on his 1906 trip. [...] The funds from the sales of these items allowed him to meet expenses on the road. Meeker's exploits were closely followed in newspapers on the West Coast as eastern and midwestern stories about him were reprinted there—when westerners perceived any slights towards Meeker, indignant editorials followed.|$|E
40|$|Experiential {{learning}} is learning {{that comes from}} doing, and provides advantages over the traditional delivery of lectures. The hands-on learning approach {{and the experience of}} carrying out (for example, through role play) an assigned exercise can help students internalize concepts they learn in class. Many students find experiential learning a fun exercise that enhances their classroom experience. This paper details the nature of an experiential exercise examined in two courses in an undergraduate degree program, namely, Salesmanship, and Industrial Marketing. During the semester, the experiential exercise involved every student in an assignment, carried out individually, that gave them the experience of attempting to sell a product or service to potential customers through a <b>sales</b> <b>pitching.</b> Assessment was divided into two separate parts, for: (i) the <b>sales</b> <b>pitching,</b> and (ii) oral presentation. For the <b>sales</b> <b>pitching,</b> students were assessed on whether he/she was able to match certain features of the product to the customer’s advantage. While for the oral presentation, a rubric was utilized to assess students on eight criteria: organization, subject knowledge, visual aids, eye contact, pronunciation, clarity of voice, confidence, and attire. Students were scored on four levels of performance, with a score of 1 (Below basic), 2 (Basic), 3 (Proficient), and 4 (Advanced). The study showed that students who were taught and discussed, as part of their syllabus, the topic of salesmanship, performed better than their counterpart who were only given a little guidance. Results of the <b>sales</b> <b>pitching</b> provide evidence that selling can be learnt...|$|R

2500|$|That <b>sales</b> <b>pitch</b> {{was typical}} of Wolfman Jack's growling, exuberant on-air style.

Ground was broken in 1928, and the club opened for business in 1929. Membership was to be limited, and free memberships were given to public figures of the day in order to attract other members. Members included the celebrities Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey, and Ring Lardner.|$|E
5000|$|Medicine shows {{combined}} {{various forms}} of popular entertainment with <b>sales</b> <b>pitches</b> from a self-proclaimed [...] "doctor" [...] who sold an astounding cure-all medicine or device. Shows played either outdoors from a wagon, platform or tent, or indoors in a theatre or opera hall. Admission was usually free or nominal. Pitchmen would make grandiose claims about their product’s efficacy, sometimes planting testimonials in the audience. The speaker's goal {{was to create a}} need, or fear, then offer his unique medicine as the only cure. Alternating entertainment with <b>sales</b> <b>pitches</b> wore down the audience's resistance, until the crowd was saturated with a desire for the product. The show would continue to run as many days as possible, then {{move on to the next}} town.
