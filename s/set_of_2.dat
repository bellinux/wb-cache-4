25|$|Prairie dog {{copulation}} {{occurs in}} the burrows, and this {{reduces the risk of}} interruption by a competing male. They are also at less risk of predation. Behaviors that signal that a female is in estrus include underground consorting, self-licking of genitals, dust-bathing, and late entrances into the burrow at night. The licking of genitals may protect against sexually transmitted diseases and genital infections, while dust-bathing may protect against fleas and other parasites. Prairie dogs also have a mating call which consists of a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>2</b> to 25 barks with a 3- to 15-second pause between each one. Females may try to increase their reproduction success by mating with males outside their family groups. When copulation is over, the male is no longer interested in the female sexually, but will prevent other males from mating with her by inserting copulatory plugs.|$|E

2500|$|The theorem {{can also}} be {{extended}} to hypergraphs. An m-hypergraph is a graph whose [...] "edges" [...] are sets of m vertices – in a normal graph an edge is a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>2</b> vertices. The full statement of Ramsey's theorem for hypergraphs is that for any integers m and c, and any integers n1, …, n'c, there is an integer R(n1, …, n'c;c, m) such that if the hyperedges of a complete m-hypergraph of order R(n1, …, n'c;c, m) are coloured with c different colours, then for some i between 1 and c, the hypergraph must contain a complete sub-m-hypergraph of order n'i whose hyperedges are all colour i. This theorem is usually proved by induction on m, the 'hyper-ness' of the graph. The base case for the proof is mnbsp&=nbsp&2, which is exactly the theorem above.|$|E
