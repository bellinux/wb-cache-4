[...] Her political positions were well matched to the different constituencies in the state that she targeted. [...] In a January 2000 appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, she established a rapport with the host that would continue throughout her Senate years and into her 2008 presidential campaign.

The costume, first worn by student Pat Sheehan, has been updated numerous times, most recently in 2013.

Sliding windows were replaced with winding windows—although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening quarterlight windows).

2500|$|The party's {{founding}} members chose the name [...] "Republican Party" [...] in the mid-1850s as {{homage to the}} values of republicanism promoted by Thomas Jefferson's Republican party.

The name reflects the 1776 republican values of civic virtue and opposition to aristocracy and corruption.

2500|$|A modus decimandi, {{commonly}} {{called by the}} <b>simple</b> <b>name</b> of a modus only, is where there is by custom a particular manner of tithing allowed, different from the general law of taking tithes in kind, which are the actual tenth part of the annual increase. This is sometimes a pecuniary compensation, as twopence an acre for the tithe of land : sometimes it is a compensation in work and labour, as that the parson shall have only the twelfth cock of hay, and not the tenth, in consideration of the owner's making it for him: sometimes, {{in lieu of a}} large quantity of crude or imperfect tithe, the parson shall have a less quantity, when arrived to greater maturity, as a couple of fowls in lieu of tithe eggs and the like.

2500|$|The federal {{legislation}} lacked adequate oversight and accountability. The two companies {{took advantage of}} these weaknesses in the legislation to manipulate the project and produce extra profit for themselves. Despite the generous subsidies offered by the federal government, the railroad capitalists knew they would not turn a profit on the railroad business for many months, possibly years. They determined {{to make a profit}} on the construction itself. Both groups of financiers formed independent companies to complete the project, and they controlled management of the new companies along with the railroad ventures. This self-dealing allowed them to build in generous profit margins paid out by the railroad companies. In the west, the four men heading the Central Pacific chose a <b>simple</b> <b>name</b> for their company, the [...] "Contract and Finance Company."

2500|$|Another Polish Jew {{proposed}} {{as a suspect}} in the Jack the Ripper murders was Aaron Davis Cohen or David Cohen, whose incarceration at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum roughly coincided {{with the end of the}} murders. He was committed on 12 December 1888, about one month after the murder of Mary Jane Kelly on 9 November. He was described as violently antisocial, exhibited destructive tendencies while at the asylum, and had to be restrained. He was the same age as Kosminski, and died at the asylum in October 1889. Author Martin Fido suggested in his book The Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper (1987) that the name [...] "David Cohen" [...] was used by the asylum as a <b>simple</b> <b>name</b> for an inmate whose true name (Kosminski or Kaminsky) was too difficult to spell or easily misunderstood. Fido identified Cohen with [...] "Leather Apron", a Polish Jewish bootmaker blamed for the murders in local gossip, and speculated that Cohen's true identity was Nathan Kaminsky, a bootmaker living in Whitechapel who had been treated at one time for syphilis. Fido was unable to trace Kaminsky after May 1888, and records of Cohen began that December. Fido suggested that police officials confused the name Kaminsky with Kosminski, resulting in the wrong man coming under suspicion. As with Kosminski, the asylum case notes say he spoke only Yiddish.|$|E
2500|$|The Wendy's Company traces {{its history}} back to several predecessors, {{the oldest of}} which (Deisel-Wemmer Co., a cigar {{manufacturer}} and importer based in Ohio) was founded in 1884. By January 23, 1929, Deisel-Wemmer incorporated as Deisel-Wemmer-Gilbert Corporation (DWG) when acquired by an investment group. DWG was a small outfit and just to keep up market share purchased other small cigar companies like Odin cigars in 1930 and the Bernard Schwartz Cigar Corporation in 1939. The Company on May 15, 1946, {{changed its name to}} a <b>simple</b> <b>name,</b> DWG Cigar Corporation. Another series of acquisitions started in 1948 with the Nathan Elson Company following with A. Sensenbrenner & Sons in 1955 and in 1956 Chicago Motor Club Cigar and Reading, Pennsylvania-based Yocum Brothers. With the weakening of the cigar market due to medical advisories, many smokers switch to cigarettes, which were then believed to be safer. DWG then steamlined cigar operations and began looking for other businesses that might suite DWG's wholesale and distribution strength. The New York Stock Exchange delisted DWG in 1965 after an attempt at purchasing Allegheny Pepsi bottling company failed. DWG, thus free from NYSE reporting requirements, [...] sold their remaining cigar operations or closed them in 1966. [...] Renamed as DWG Corporation, DWG used its cash from the cigar operation sale to purchase a 12% share of the National Propane Corporation. [...] Security Management Company, headed by Victor Posner, a major investor in DWG saw potential with the company as it was bold to sell its main operation.
