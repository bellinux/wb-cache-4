40|$|Neuromorphic {{computing}} {{based on}} single-electron circuit technology is gaining prominence because of recent claims about its massively increased computational efficiency and its increasing relevance between computer technology and nanotechnology [1], [2]. Its {{impact will be}} strongly felt maximum when single-electron circuits can operate at room temperature, based on fault-and noise-tolerant neural structures. In this paper, inspired by stochastic resonance (SR) in an ensemble of spiking neurons [3], we designed a basic single-electron neural component and examined its statistical results on the network. A single-electron box, in which a quantum dot lies between a nanoscale tunnel junction with capacitance C and a gate capacitance CG whose order of magnitude is close to that of C, is the simplest tunnel junction circuit [4]. We see a significant similarity between single-electron boxes and conductance-based neuron models, that is the tunnel junction and CG in a single-electron box correspond to a voltage-controlled gate and membrane capacitance in the neuron model, respectively. Furthermore, electron tunneling at the junction results in a <b>sudden</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>change</b> on the quantum dot (therefore it corresponds to a spike generation in neurons) and is easily perturbed by thermal fluctuations, as in real neurons...|$|E
40|$|The {{junction}} {{behavior of}} different narrow band-gap multi-quantum-well (MQW) laser diodes (LDs) {{confirmed that the}} jump in the junction voltage in the threshold region is a general characteristic of narrow band-gap LDs. The relative change in the 1310 nm LD is the most obvious. To analyze this <b>sudden</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>change,</b> the threshold region {{is divided into three}} stages by Ithl and Ithu, as shown in Fig. 2; Ithl is the conventional threshold, {{and as long as the}} current is higher than this threshold, lasing exists and the IdV/dI-I plot drops suddenly; Ithu is the steady lasing point, at which the separation of the quasi-Fermi levels of electron and holes across the active region (Vj) is suddenly pinned. Based on the evolutionary model of dissipative structure theory, the rate equations of the photons in a single-mode LD were deduced in detail at Ithl and Ithu. The results proved that the observed behavior of stimulated emission suddenly substituting for spontaneous emission, in a manner similar to biological evolution, must lead to a sudden increase in the injection carriers in the threshold region, which then causes the sudden increase in the junction voltage in this region...|$|E

40|$|Using the {{classical}} model of power system, Fouad and Vittal developed individual machine energy functions {{in order to}} identify the transient energy tending to separate a particular machine {{from the rest of the}} system(2 ̆ 71);To improve the confidence in first swing transient stability assessment a more realistic model of the loads is used. In the proposed non-linear model, the loads are represented by any desired combination of constant impedance, constant current or constant-MVA models. The effect of the non-linear loads is reflected at the internal nodes of the generators as injected currents. The non-linear injected currents account for the <b>sudden</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>changes</b> immediately following the disturbance;Expressions for the individual machine energy functions, which represent the effects of the non-linear load models, are obtained. Using the criterion of stability suggested by Fouad and Vittal, first swing transient stability assessments are made for two multimachine test power networks. A number of cases, under a variety of load compositions, were tested. Analysis of the results obtained have demonstrated the effects of non-linear load representation on the energy absorbing capacity of the network, critical fault clearing time and the mode of instability. Comparisons have also been made between the critical fault clearing times obtained above and those;obtained using time solution such as Philadelphia Electric Co. 2 ̆ 7 s transient stability program; (2 ̆ 71) Vittal, V. 2 ̆ 2 Power System Transient Stability using the Critical Energy of Individual Machines. 2 ̆ 2 Ph.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{parallel}} processing uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for <b>sudden</b> <b>voltage</b> fluctuation in power management to integrate power quality improvement, load voltage stabilization and UPS. To reduce the complexity, cost and number of power conversions, which results in higher efficiency, only one voltage-controlled voltage source inverter (VCVSI) is used. The VCVSI is connected in series on the DC battery side and in parallel on the AC grid side with a decoupling inductor. The system provides sinusoidal voltage at the fundamental value of 220 V/ 60 Hz for the load during abnormal utility power conditions or grid failure. Also, the system can be operated to mitigate the harmonic current and voltage demand from nonlinear loads and provide voltage stabilization for loads when <b>sudden</b> <b>voltage</b> fluctuation occur, such as sag and swell. The experimental results confirm the system protects against outages caused by abnormal utility power conditions and <b>sudden</b> <b>voltage</b> fluctuations and <b>change.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Power {{systems are}} {{protected}} by numerical relays that detect and isolate faults that may occur on power systems. The correct operation of the relay {{is very important to}} maintain the security of the power system. Numerical relays that use voltage measurements from the power system provided by coupling capacitor voltage transformers (CCVT) have sometimes difficulty in correctly identifying a fault in the protected area. The fundamental frequency voltage phasor resulting from these CCVT measurements may result in a deviation from the true value and therefore may locate this phasor temporarily in the incorrect operating region. This phasor deviation is due to the CCVT behavior and the CCVT introduces spurious decaying and oscillating transient signal components on top of the original voltage received from the power system in response to <b>sudden</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>changes</b> produced during faults. Most of the existing methods for estimating the voltage phasor do not take advantage of the knowledge of the CCVT behavior that can be obtained from its design parameters. A new least squares error method for phasor estimation is presented in this thesis, which improves the accuracy and speed of convergence of the phasors obtained, using the knowledge of the CCVT behavior. The characteristics of the transient signal components introduced by the CCVT, such as frequencies and time constants of decay, are included in the description of the curve to be fitted, which is required in a least squares fitting technique. Parameters such as window size and sampling rate for optimum results are discussed. The method proposed is evaluated using typical power systems, with results that can be compared to the response if an ideal potential transformer (PT) were used instead of a CCVT. The limitations of this method are found in some specific power system scenarios, where the natural frequencies of the power system are close to that of the CCVT, but with longer time constants. The accuracy with which the CCVT parameters are known is also assessed, with results that show little impact compared to the improvements achievable...|$|R
40|$|A {{control system}} was developed, which allows on-site {{generators}} within a building {{to operate in}} islanding mode, {{in the event of}} loss of grid supply. The on-site generation included a photovoltaic array and a back-up induction generator. Regulation include avoidance of <b>sudden</b> <b>voltage</b> and frequency <b>changes</b> at the transition to islanding mode, maintaining voltage and frequency within limits during islanding, and phase matching when the grid supply is re-established. Possible modes of operation during islanding were photovoltaic array alone, generator alone, or both sources operating in parallel. Control methods were considered for each of these, and the resulting voltage and frequency regulation was anal sized. The results show that voltage and frequency could be kept within limits, except during the transitions to and from islanding. At these times, the transients were minimised...|$|R
