50|$|Though {{developed}} {{for use on}} land, the falconet gained naval prominence during the 17th century for the defence of light vessels; for example, <b>on</b> <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> for boarding manoeuvres.

50|$|Around {{the turn}} of the 20th century {{outlying}} communities all over Puget Sound, particularly those on the many islands, were dependent <b>on</b> <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> and ships for delivering goods and basic transportation. The primary shipping lane from Seattle to Tacoma was along the east side of Vashon Island.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 18 {{was used}} {{primarily}} <b>on</b> <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> or in fixed positions such as bunkers; their primary users were the so-called “river rats” and the SEALs. They could be mounted on M2HB, M60, M1919 tripods, or pintle mounts, {{but could not}} be fired without such a mount.|$|R
50|$|Zinc and {{aluminium}} {{are generally}} used in salt water, where the resistivity is generally lower. Typical uses {{are for the}} hulls of ships and boats, offshore pipelines and production platforms, in salt-water-cooled marine engines, <b>on</b> <b>small</b> <b>boat</b> propellers and rudders, and for the internal surface of storage tanks.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to land mobile use, waterproof walkie talkie designs {{are also used}} for marine VHF and aviation communications, especially <b>on</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>boats</b> and ultralight aircraft where mounting a fixed radio might be impractical or expensive. Often such units will have switches to provide quick access to emergency and information channels.|$|R
50|$|Where used <b>on</b> <b>small</b> <b>boats,</b> {{the bearing}} is often moulded in one {{cylindrical}} piece of rubber, although the inner surface is grooved {{so that it}} still functions as a stave bearing. Although small, these rubber bearings are still capable of handling a high power, even a 2,350 hp record-breaker like Bluebird K4.|$|R

50|$|After {{introducing}} an Australian {{naval architect}} {{to a friend}} who had a 45-foot yacht requiring some modifications, a conversation arose around the lack of a reliable and sensitive gas detector designed for use <b>on</b> <b>small</b> <b>boats.</b> In fact there had been a number of fires and explosions <b>on</b> board <b>small</b> <b>boats,</b> because the detectors on the market were not reliable and were not always able to detect a leak if one occurred. The absence of such a device in the marketplace interested Sieger greatly and he decided to make the design of a suitable gas detection device his first consultancy project on his own behalf.|$|R
50|$|The Inglefield clip (also {{known as}} a sister clip and a Brummel hook) is a clip for joining a flag or ensign quickly, easily and {{securely}} to flag halyards so that the flag can be hoisted.

25|$|From Funafuti, Phaon {{advanced}} westward to Majuro in the Marshall Islands, arriving 6 February 1944, {{shortly after}} the invasion. Here, in the same harbor {{with one of the}} mightiest fleets ever assembled, Phaon worked on minelayers, tankers, minesweepers, destroyers, and <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> (LCVPs and LCMs). On 18 March 1944, Phaon weighed anchor again, proceeded via Kwajalein to Eniwetok in the Marshalls, arriving 23 March for repair work <b>on</b> <b>small</b> <b>boats,</b> LCTs, and yard minesweepers.|$|R
25|$|In May 1942, three youngsters, Peter Hassall, Maurice Gould, and Denis Audrain, {{attempted}} {{to escape from}} Jersey in a boat (Audrain drowned, Hassall and Gould were imprisoned in Germany, where Gould died). Following this escape attempt, restrictions <b>on</b> <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> and watercraft were introduced and after each attempt, further temporary bans and restrictions and penalties were imposed.|$|R
5000|$|A Hand Bailer is {{a device}} used for {{removing}} water which has entered a boat. In the simplest case, {{it is merely}} a container which can be filled manually and then emptied. This kind of device is in use since early times. It is still in use <b>on</b> <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> and rafts. Some regulations require them as mandatory equipment.|$|R
50|$|This {{procedure}} {{is also necessary}} for gybing a dipping lug. Reportedly, this action can be completed expeditiously on a larger boat with four hands. <b>On</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>boats,</b> the sail is simply lowered and the mast unstepped to allow the sail to be moved beneath {{it to the other}} side and the mast to be re-stepped and the sail raised.|$|R
5000|$|Quellón is a Chilean {{port city}} and commune in {{southern}} Chiloé Island, Los Lagos Region. It {{is considered an}} end-station of the Panamerican Highway and the Pacific Coastal Highway.

50|$|Bilge keel - a longitudinal, external, {{underwater}} member used {{to reduce}} a ship's tendency to roll. In Britain twin bilge keels are often used <b>on</b> <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> moored in estuaries with a large tidal range so the boat stay upright when dried out. With their much shallower draft yachts of this type can be sailed in shallow waters. Not as hydro dynamically efficient as a fin keel.|$|R

In the 1970s, the area began to industrialize, and a bridge was constructed over the Huelva estuary, linking the capital (the city of Huelva) to the beaches of Mazagón and to the Lugares colombinos.|$|R

5000|$|Following Sir Thomas Lipton's near {{success in}} the 1920 America's Cup, he {{challenged}} again {{for the last time}} at age 79, in 1929. The challenge drew all the novelties developed in the previous decade <b>on</b> <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> to be ported onto large boats, and pitted British and American yacht design in a technological race. Between 1930 and 1937, the improvements brought to the design of sailboats were numerous and significant: ...|$|R
5000|$|A Bermuda-rigged sloop {{is one of}} {{the best}} racing rigs per square foot of sail area as is it very weatherly, making it faster on upwind passages. This rig is the most popular for {{recreational}} boating because of its potential for high performance. <b>On</b> <b>small</b> <b>boats,</b> it can be a simple rig. On larger sloops, the large sails have high loads, and one must manage them with winches or multiple purchase block-and-tackle devices.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1880s, Panzós {{had become}} a very {{important}} commercial river port, used heavily for coffee export; [...] finish product was carried by oxen carts by poor kept roads, or <b>on</b> <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> through creeks to the port, and from there it was loaded into larger ships {{and sent to the}} Caribbean Sea and then on to Europe or other destinations. This archaic system changed drastically in the 1890s, once the Verapaz Railroad was built.|$|R

50|$|A model proa, {{called a}} riwuit, is often raced by children. Proas could be paddled or sailed. The {{traditional}} sail {{used on the}} proa was the crab-claw sail, which generates far more lift than the more common triangular sloop rig used <b>on</b> <b>small</b> <b>boats,</b> particularly when reaching. The sloop rig only begins to show an advantage with small angles of attack, such as encountered when close-hauled. This {{is the result of}} the higher aspect ratio of the sloop.|$|R
40|$|A {{hydraulic}} power-take-off {{was designed}} and built for outboard engines typical of those used <b>on</b> <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> and Pacific City-type dories. An associated hydraulic system was developed for use on these boats to provide power for fishing machinery. The power for each system was provided by a hydraulic pump direct-drive coupled to the outboard engine crankshaft at the flywheel. Four 19 70 model outboard engines were used during the project for the design and testing of these systems. These engines were:...|$|R

5000|$|The {{spinnaker}} sheet {{attaches to}} the clew(s) of the spinnaker, if carried. A symmetrical spinnaker has two sheets, an [...] "active" [...] one and a [...] "lazy" [...] one, {{in the same way}} as a jib, but they are attached to the sail's two separate clews. On boats larger than around thirty feet, the spinnaker will also be fitted with guys, which are similar to sheets but control the pole instead of the sail. <b>On</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>boats</b> the lazy sheet is used as a guy.|$|R

There, she repaired LCTs, pontoon barges, and PT boats. She restored many craft used in the invasion of Tarawa, Gilbert Islands. From Funafuti, Phaon advanced westward to Majuro in the Marshall Islands, arriving 6 February 1944, shortly after the invasion. Here, in the same harbor {{with one of the}} mightiest fleets ever assembled, Phaon worked on minelayers, tankers, minesweepers, destroyers, and <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> (LCVPs and LCMs).
