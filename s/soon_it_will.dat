5|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism {{a major source of}} income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The local equivalent of the National Trust is very small, and there is much less local interest among the general population. The Princes, Marquesses, and Counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay. It is only today both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if action is not taken <b>soon</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be too late to save this particular part of the Sicilian heritage.|$|E
5|$|Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; {{angelfish}} and zebras are striped. These patterns have {{an evolutionary}} explanation: they have functions which {{increase the chances}} that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is camouflage; for instance, a leopard that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is signalling — for instance, a ladybird {{is less likely to}} be attacked by predatory birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also distastefully bitter or poisonous, or mimics other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very <b>soon</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting genes that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.|$|E

[...] "to provide {{educational}} {{assistance to}} the dependents of Federal law enforcement officials who are killed or disabled {{in the performance of}} their duties." [...] In 2001 Frank co-sponsored [...] "the MX Missile Stand-Down Act" [...] (01-HR2718) to take fifty Peacekeeper missiles off of high-alert status as well as the Landmine Elimination and Victim Assistance Act (01-HR948). As of December 2003, Frank had an 89% rating by Peace Action, indicating a pro-peace voting record. In 2005, he co-sponsored [...] "Rail Security Act" [...] (S.1379/H.R.153) (05-S1379) giving higher priority to rail transportation security. In 2008, he co-sponsored the [...] "Veterans Suicide Study Act" [...] ( [...] (S.2899/H.R.4204) 08-S2899) designed to study and address suicides among veterans. As of the 111th Congress, Frank is advocating a 25-percent reduction in the overall Military budget of the United States. [...] "The math is compelling: if we do not make reductions approximating 25 percent of the military budget starting fairly <b>soon,</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be impossible to continue to fund an adequate level of domestic activity...," [...] wrote Frank. He claimed that such a significant reduction would have no effect on the United States' ability to defend itself. [...] "If," [...] he said, [...] "beginning one year from now, we were to cut military spending by 25 percent from its projected levels, we would still be immeasurably stronger than any combination of nations with whom we might be engaged." [...] Frank supports having fewer F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes, but also supports a $3-billion backup engine project that the Pentagon does not want. [...] Frank told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann that he actually wanted to cut the entire F-35 program, but as long as military spending continued, he would fight for his district's share of it.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that despite a [...] "potentially gimmicky tone", the episode provided [...] "a {{lot of fun}} moments along with a little emotional content as well. The show usually balanced sentimentality cleanly, and that occurred here; it avoided becoming too syrupy and featured just enough emotion to make an impact. It also contained some great bits, like Bart and Lisa’s karaoke performance of the 'Theme from Shaft'. It also ended on a hilarious and incisive note." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was the sushi restaurant hostess's [...] "This is our karaoke bar. Now it is empty, but <b>soon</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be hopping with drunken Japanese businessmen." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Again, a playful dig at racial stereotypes. Homer comes over as a reasonable {{man who wants to}} live his last day in style, and the closing twist is easily as good as the farewells leading up to it." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said that the episode is [...] "rich with sentimentality and Homer's expression of love for his family as he fears that his time is up." [...] He also commented that while all of the chalkboard gags on the show are [...] "funny", this episode [...] "features a true gem" [...] as Bart writes [...] "I will not cut corners" [...] once and then puts ditto marks below. Ed Potton of The Times wrote: [...] "The writers offer black humour by the bucketload, but the grim reality of Homer's fate is never in doubt; his eventual collapse is deeply affecting. A great example of [...] fierce satire being offset by a potent emotional core." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said {{the first half of the}} episode has [...] "fun skewering Japanese restaurants and such, while the second half is reasonably successful at emphasizing character while sustaining the comedy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Which {{particular}} nation {{an impoverished}} person lives in deeply affects health outcomes. This {{can be attributed}} to governmental, environmental, geographical, and cultural factors. Using life expectancy as a measure of health indicates a difference between countries in likeliness of living to a certain age. Where people are born dramatically impacts their life chances. High-income countries like Japan or Sweden have a life expectancy of 80 years, Brazil-72, India-63. The WHO cites that for rich countries, only 56 (Iceland) to 107 (US) of 1000 adults between 15 and 60 years old will die each year, while Western and Central African countries have adult mortality rates exceeding 300 and 400 of every 1000. The rates are even higher in African nations suffering the AIDS epidemic, such as Zimbabwe where 772 of 1000 adults die each year (WHO 2010). Also, the type of health affliction varies by countries for populations in poverty. [...] Over 80% of cardiovascular disease deaths, that totaled 17.5 million people globally in 2005, occur in low- and middle-income countries. [...] According to the WHO,13500 people die from smoking every day, and <b>soon</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> become {{the leading cause of death}} in developing countries, just as in high income countries.
