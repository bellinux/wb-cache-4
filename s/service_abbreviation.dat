50|$|As Enigma was {{the central}} element, i.e. control, of the naval U-boat offensive, the Kriegsmarine strived to ensure the {{security}} of the machine. As with the continual security review conducted during the interwar years, the process continued during the war years. B-Diensts own communications were monitored for mistakes on an continual basis. For example, during the Norwegian Campaign, the Büffel, boat NS25, a converted whaler used as an auxiliary patrol ship, made a mistake, when it requested a weather report with the <b>service</b> <b>abbreviation</b> QOB. This was an impossible situation for the answering telegraphist, as Bletchley Park cryptanalysts would know that the returned message was a weather report, i.e. offering a crib, and made the answer impossible to deliver. Radioman Wilhelm Lemcke, who sent the message, was sent to Stavanger for additional training. Physical and logical exposure of Enigma machinery and keying documentation was equally important and was limited, whenever possible. For example, vessels which were expected to encounter shallow water, where Enigma materials could be recovered, were instructed to carry none whatsoever, and instead use the hand cipher (German:Reservehandverfahren) For example, the U-boat U-47, which sank the HMS Royal Oak on the October 14th 1939, carried only a hand cipher. When the Admiral Graf Spee scuttled herself in shallow water, the Enigma machinery and keying documents were already safely stored by the German Naval Attaché in Monte Video.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{major cause}} of death in the city of São Paulo (SP) is cardiac events. At its periphery, {{in-hospital}} mortality in acute myocardial infarction is estimated to range between 15 % and 20 % due to difficulties inherent in large metropoles. Objective: To describe in-hospital mortality in ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) of patients admitted via ambulance or peripheral hospitals, which are part of a structured training network (STEMI Network). Methods: Health care teams of four emergency services (Ermelino Matarazzo, Campo Limpo, Tatuapé and Saboya) of the periphery of the city of São Paulo and advanced ambulances of the Emergency Mobile Health Care <b>Service</b> (<b>abbreviation</b> in Portuguese, SAMU) were trained to use tenecteplase or to refer for primary angioplasty. A central office for electrocardiogram reading was used. After thrombolysis, the patient was sent to a tertiary reference hospital to undergo cardiac catheterization immediately (in case of failed thrombolysis) or in 6 to 24 hours, if the patient was stable. Quantitative and qualitative variables were assessed by use of uni- and multivariate analysis. Results: From January 2010 to June 2011, 205 consecutive patients used the STEMI Network, and the findings were as follows: 87 anterior wall infarctions; 11 left bundle-branch blocks; 14 complete atrioventricular blocks; and 14 resuscitations afte...|$|E

50|$|Widespread use of {{electronic}} communication through mobile phones and the Internet during the 1990s {{allowed for a}} marked rise in colloquial abbreviation. This was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as instant- and text messaging. SMS, for instance, supports message lengths of 160 characters at most (using the GSM 03.38 character set). This brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called Textese, with which 10% {{or more of the}} words in a typical SMS message are abbreviated. More recently Twitter, a popular social networking <b>service,</b> began driving <b>abbreviation</b> use with 140 character message limits.|$|R
40|$|Many {{abbreviations}} {{are used}} in the literature especially in the life sciences, and polysemous abbreviations appear frequently, making it difficult to read and understand scientific papers that are outside of a reader’s expertise. Thus, we have developed Allie, a database and a search <b>service</b> of <b>abbreviations</b> and their long forms (a. k. a. full forms or definitions). Allie searches for abbreviations and their corresponding long forms in a database that we have generated based on all titles and abstracts in MEDLINE. When a user query matches an abbreviation, Allie returns all potential long forms of the query along with their bibliographic data (i. e. title and publication year). In addition, for each candidate, co-occurring abbreviations and a research field in which it frequently appears in the MEDLINE data are displayed. This function helps users learn about the context in which an abbreviation appears. To deal with synonymous long forms, we use a dictionary called GENA that contains domain-specific terms such as gene, protein or disease names along with their synonymic information. Conceptually identical domain-specific terms are regarded as one term, and then conceptually identical abbreviation-long form pairs are grouped taking into account their appearance in MEDLINE. To keep up with new abbre-viations that are continuously introduced, Allie has an automatic update system. In addition, the database of abbreviation...|$|R
25|$|Conservative {{services}} generally use {{the same}} basic format for services as in Orthodox Judaism with some doctrinal leniencies and some prayers in English.

In traditionalist congregations the liturgy can be almost identical to that of Orthodox Judaism, almost entirely in Hebrew (and Aramaic), with a few minor exceptions, including excision of a study session on Temple sacrifices, and modifications of prayers {{for the restoration of}} the sacrificial system. In more liberal Conservative synagogues there are greater changes to the service, with up to a third of the <b>service</b> in English; <b>abbreviation</b> or omission of many of the preparatory prayers; and replacement of some traditional prayers with more contemporary forms. There are some changes for doctrinal reasons, including egalitarian language, fewer references to restoring sacrifices in the Temple in Jerusalem, and an option to eliminate special roles for Kohanim and Levites.|$|R
