50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 18th century a Russian industrialist from Ural, Evdokim Demidov, ordered two dams to be built on the Nepolot river. Two reservoirs were created: upper (Lyudinovskoye) and lower (Sukremlskoye). An iron foundry was built near the Sukremlskoye reservoir in 1738. Ironworks near Lyudinovsky reservoir were built in 1745. Nowadays Lyudinovsky Lokomotive Plant located there. In 1841 the first Russian rails for Nikolaevskaya railway were produced here. In 1857-1858 these works produced vessels for Russian Black <b>Sea</b> Fleet and <b>river</b> <b>vessels.</b> First Russian steamers were built here in 1858.|$|R

For this purpose a mathematical model of process of superficial plastic deformation is represent, as the hypercycle of loading consisting of elementary cycles – of blows. Is described a method of operative control of processing with use of the standard measurement devices. The technology is intended for use during the manufacturing and repair of any metal walls in places of dimensional and structural nonuniformity such as mechanical defects or a local thinning of a surface owing to corrosion and the microcracks which {{under the influence of}} the external forces become zones of concentration of mechanical tension. Hardening in such places of walls of the pipes and tanks working under pressure and having operational loadings in the form of tangential mechanical tensions which is described by a boiler formula or its special cases is effective for pipelines of an oil and gas, water supply systems and also for caissons and tanks of other appointment. The scope of technology can include the repair of <b>sea</b> and <b>river</b> <b>vessels</b> and also of floating objects of oil production. The technology can be applied to improvement of operational characteristics of details of mechanical engineering and transport, objects of energetic and construction: surfaces of a rolling motion and sliding of machines and devices, wheels of a rolling stock of railway transport, a metalwork of support of power lines, platforms and bridges for the purpose of increases in resistance of fatigue at cyclic loadings, wear resistance and corrosion...|$|R

Leybourne-Popham appointed Joseph Wiggins as captain of Blencathra for an 1893 voyage to the Kara Sea and into the Yenisei River, thus taking the ship to the furthest reaches of Siberia. To combine business with pleasure, he formed a syndicate to exploit the commercial opportunities offered by the carriage of cargo to the far north. As plans were being finalised, Wiggins received an urgent request from the Russians to carry rails for the Trans-Siberian Railway up the Yenisey to Krasnoyarsk. A 2,500-ton steamer, Orestes, was chartered and four Russian <b>river</b> <b>vessels</b> were provided for the final stages of transport in the Yenisey.
