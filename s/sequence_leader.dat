By examining {{a series of}} deletion and substitution constructs in transgenic potato plants, we found that this pattern of expression requires 5 ' flanking sequences both upstream and downstream of position - 1500 and that sequences between positions - 1500 and - 267 are essential for sucrose induction.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{transcriptional}} pausing on attenuation is investigated theoretically {{on the basis}} of the attenuation control mechanism presented by Oxender et al. (Oxender, D. L., G. Zurawski, and C. Yanofsky, 1979, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 76 : 5524 - 5528). An extended stochastic model including the RNA polymerase pausing in the leader region is developed to calculate the probability of relative position between the RNA polymerase transcribing the trp <b>leader</b> <b>sequence</b> and the ribosome translating the transcript. The present study results in a new rationale that the transcriptional pausing site in the <b>leader</b> <b>sequence</b> makes the attenuation control both more sensitive as an on/off switch and less sensitive to variations in the concentration of cellular metabolites not connected with the need for expressing, or not expressing, the particular operon.
