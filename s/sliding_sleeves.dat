50|$|The first {{successful}} sleeve valve was patented by Charles Yale Knight, and used twin alternating <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeves.</b> It {{was used in}} some luxury automobiles, notably Willys, Daimler, Mercedes-Benz, Minerva, Panhard, Peugeot and Avions Voisin. Mors adopted double sleeve-valve engines made by Minerva.The higher oil consumption was heavily outweighed by the quietness of running and the very high mileages without servicing. Early poppet-valve systems required decarbonization at very low mileages. The Burt-McCollum sleeve valve was named for the two inventors that applied for similar patents {{within a few weeks}} of each other. The Burt system was an open sleeve type, driven from the crankshaft side, while the McCollum design had a sleeve in the head and upper part of the cylinder, and a more complex port arrangement (Source: 'Torque Meter' Magazine, AEHS). The design that entered production was more 'Burt' than 'McCollum.' It was used by the Scottish company Argyll for its cars, and was later adopted by Bristol for its radial aircraft engines. It used a single sleeve which rotated around a timing axle set at 90 degrees to the cylinder axis. Mechanically simpler and more rugged, the Burt-McCollum valve had the additional advantage of reducing oil consumption (compared to other sleeve valve designs), while retaining the combustion chambers and big, uncluttered, porting area possible in the Knight system.|$|E

30|$|At this point, it is {{important}} to distinguish “autonomous” FCDs from “active” FCDs; autonomous FCDs exhibit the control over unwanted fluids passively and without operator intervention relying on properties intrinsic to the fluid or fluid regime to trigger changing behavior. By contrast, active FCDs (such as intelligent control valves and FCDs with <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeves.),</b> require oversight by operators and direct intervention in order for there to be a change in performance behavior. Three commercial FCD geometries exhibit autonomous behavior: fluidic diodes, rate-controlled production valves, and hybrid FCDs. However, the manner by which each provides autonomy varies wildly from manufacturer to manufacturer and introduce new operational advantages and risks depending on the mechanism of action.|$|E

It contains 8 superconducting RF cavities made from solid pure niobium and a quadrupole package. The cryostat includes two aluminum shields of 4. 5 and 70 K with multilayer insulation on the outside. The helium distribution system needed to operate the superconducting cavities at 2 K and the magnets at 4. 5 K is also integrated into the cryostat. The two phase line transfers helium to the cavities, the gas return line transports gas from the cavities to the refrigeration plant. This line {{is connected to the}} cavity helium vessels via a helium bath {{at the end of the}} module. The 4. 5 K forward and return lines cool the quadrupole package, the radiation shield and the 4. 5 K intercept on the input coupler. The 70 K lines have the corresponding effect on the outer radiation shield and the 70 K intercept of the coupler. The cryostat outer vacuum vessel is constructed of carbon steel and is evacuated to a pressure of less than 10 - 6 mbar during operation. In the Tesla Test Facility TTF it is connected by <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeves</b> to a feedcap which provides the link to the cryogenic supply at the upstream end of the prototype module.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of consumption and emissions {{is a key}} fac- tor in modern vehicle design. The overall vehicle efficiency is pursued in several ways, including the {{reduction of}} consumption of the auxiliary devices (e. g. water pumps, oil pumps, vacuum pumps etc.). In this paper, using two different smart materials (i. e. magnetorheological fluids and shape memory alloys) a de- vice aimed at disengaging the vacuum pump was developed. The conceived device is composed of a magnetorheological (MR) clutch excited by permanent magnets coaxially manufac- tured with a <b>sliding</b> spline <b>sleeve</b> moved by shape memory alloys (SMA) springs. In the MR clutch, the magnet can move under {{the effect of a}} passive pneumatic system. The magnetic field in the fluid varies with the magnets displacement and as a result two steady positions are possible: the engaged clutch (ON) and the disengaged clutch (OFF). The torque in the ON configuration is high enough to drive the vacuum pump during normal operating conditions, whereas the low torque value in the OFF condition guarantees power saving up to 150 W. In particular operating conditions (i. e. at low environmen- tal temperatures) the torque necessary to start the vacuum pump may exceed the maximum transmissible torque of the MR clutch. For this reason a <b>sliding</b> spline <b>sleeve,</b> actuated by two SMA springs which counteract the force of two traditional springs was developed. A dummy plain <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeve</b> with SMA and con- ventional springs was numerically developed and tested. The fairly good agreement of the results confirmed the feasibility of the combined SMA/MR device...|$|R

50|$|It {{is usually}} run {{in close to}} the bottom end of the {{production}} tubing and set at a point above the top perforations or sand screens.

In these situations, a <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{would be used to}} select which zone to produce. Packers may also be used to protect the casing from pressure and produced fluids, isolate sections of corroded casing, casing leaks or squeezed perforations, and isolate or temporarily abandon producing zones.

In this scale, the rigid arms of a classical beam balance (for example a steelyard) are replaced with a flexible elastic rod in an inclined frictionless <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The rod can reach a unique free of sliding equilibrium when two vertical dead loads (or masses) are applied at its edges. Equilibrium, which would be impossible with rigid arms, is guaranteed because configurational forces develop at the two edges of the sleeve {{as a consequence of}} both the free sliding condition and the nonlinear kinematics of the elastic rod.

Most completion packers or plugs have a specially designed shear mechanism which release the setting tool from the element allowing it to be retrieved back to surface. The packer/plug however, remains down hole as a barrier to isolate production zones or permanently plug off a well bore.|$|R
