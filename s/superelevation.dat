25|$|The {{safety of}} a {{horizontal}} curve {{is affected by the}} length of the curve, the curve radius, whether spiral transition curves are used, and the <b>superelevation</b> of the roadway. For a given curve deflection, crashes are more likely on curves with a smaller radius. Spiral transitions decrease crashes, and insufficient <b>superelevation</b> increases crashes.|$|E
25|$|On curves {{the outer}} rail {{may be at}} a higher level than the inner rail. This is called <b>superelevation</b> or cant. This reduces the forces tending to {{displace}} the track and makes for a more comfortable ride for standing livestock and standing or seated passengers. A given amount of <b>superelevation</b> is most effective over a limited range of speeds.|$|E
25|$|The American Association of State Highway and Transportation {{officials}} (AASHTO) {{provides a}} table from which desired <b>superelevation</b> rates can be interpolated, {{based on the}} designated speed and radius of a curved section of roadway. This table {{can also be found}} in many state roadway design guides and manuals in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|On {{routes that}} carry freight traffic in cars with the maximum allowed axle loads {{it will be}} {{desirable}} to set <b>superelevations</b> so that the balancing speed of each curve {{is close to the}} speed at which most such traffic runs. This is to lessen the tendency of heavy wheel loads to crush the head of either rail.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{enhanced}} model {{to describe the}} physics of laser chemical processing (LCP), a liquid jet guided laser technique, for local doping processes applied to crystalline silicon solar cells. The main improvement of the numerical model is the consideration of the inhomogeneous laser light intensity profile within the liquid jet cross section. Measurements of the intensity profile show local <b>superelevations</b> of up to factor five compared to the average intensity. A measured intensity profile was implemented into the numerical model and yields good agreement between simulated and measured dopant distributions. Inhomogeneities of the spatial dopant distribution are observed {{and their impact on}} LCP line scans for producing doped lines is investigated with respect to solar cell manufacturing...|$|R
5000|$|For {{passenger}} traffic <b>superelevations</b> and authorized speeds {{can be set}} so that trains run with as much cant deficiency as is allowed, based on safety, on relevant regulations and on passenger comfort. As of 2007 the US Federal Railroad Administration regulations limit CD to 7 in for tilting passenger vehicles, 3 in for conventional vehicles. [...] This FRA regulation is based on AAR standards based on a single study in the 1950s on a rail line in Connecticut. [...] In Germany, where axle loads are typically lower {{than those in the}} USA, tilting trains are allowed to operate with 12 in CD in some cases. CD above 6 in can be considered too uncomfortable for passengers (e.g. things on tables might slide off), except for tilting trains.|$|R
25|$|Important {{in fields}} such as surveying, railway {{engineering}} (for example to lay out railroad curves and <b>superelevation),</b> civil engineering, astronomy, and spherical trigonometry up into the 1980s, the exsecant function is now little-used. Mainly, {{this is because the}} broad availability of calculators and computers has removed the need for trigonometric tables of specialized functions such as this one.|$|E
25|$|<b>Superelevation</b> {{slopes of}} 4 to 10% are applied {{in order to}} aid motorists in safely {{traversing}} these sections, while maintaining vehicle speed throughout {{the length of the}} curve. An upper bound of 12% was chosen {{to meet the demands of}} construction and maintenance practices, as well as to limit the difficulty of driving a steeply cross-sloped curve at low speeds. In areas that receive significant snow and ice, most agencies use a maximum cross slope of 6 to 8%. While steeper cross slope makes it difficult to traverse the slope at low speed when the surface is icy, and when accelerating from zero with warm tyres on the ice, lower cross slope increases the risk of loss-of-control at high speeds, especially when the surface is icy. Since the consequence of high speed skidding is much worse than that of sliding inward at a low speed, sharp curves have the benefit of greater net safety when designers select up to 8% <b>superelevation,</b> instead of 4%. A lower slope of 4% is commonly used on urban roadways where speeds are lower, and where a steeper slope would raise the outside road edge above adjacent terrain.|$|E
25|$|An {{improved}} junction {{replaces the}} diamond with turnouts, {{which can be}} of as fine an angle as possible, so that this junction can carry branch traffic at high speed. This configuration assumes power operation of the points, as high speed turnouts are generally not suitable for mechanical operation. The high speed turnouts may require more than one point machine each. The turnouts can have no <b>superelevation</b> while the curve in the branch can; therefore the radius in the turnouts must be greater than the radius of the curve in the branch.|$|E
2500|$|The {{equation}} for {{the desired}} radius of a curve, shown below, {{takes into account}} the factors of speed and <b>superelevation</b> (e). [...] This equation can be algebraically rearranged to obtain desired rate of <b>superelevation,</b> using input of the roadway's designated speed and curve radius.|$|E
2500|$|Insufficient <b>superelevation</b> {{will also}} {{result in an}} {{increase}} in crash rate. The expected increase is shown below: ...|$|E
2500|$|Improperly banked road curves {{increase}} the risk of run-off-road and head-on crashes. A 2% deficiency in <b>superelevation</b> (say, 4% <b>superelevation</b> on a curve that should have 6%) can be expected to increase crash frequency by 6%, and a 5% deficiency will increase it by 15%. Up until now, highway engineers have been without efficient tools to identify improperly banked curves and to design relevant mitigating road actions. A modern profilograph can provide data of both road curvature and cross slope (angle of incline). A practical demonstration of how to evaluate improperly banked turns was developed in the EU Roadex III project. [...] See the linked referenced document below.|$|E
2500|$|To {{allow for}} the tight curves, {{including}} [...] radius bends with [...] <b>superelevation</b> without any intermediate tangent and the steep, twisting nature of the line, the front engine unit's pivot bearing was spherical, with its alignment controlled by sprung rollers. The rear pivot was the usual Beyer, Peacock flat adjustable type.|$|E
2500|$|The {{installation}} of concrete ties also included {{replacement of the}} old jointed rail with new continuous welded rail (136 RE), track surfacing, and alignment.

2500|$|Using AASHTO standards, an {{engineer}} works {{to design a}} road that is safe and comfortable. [...] If a horizontal curve has a high speed and a small radius, an increased <b>superelevation</b> (bank) is {{needed in order to}} assure safety. [...] If there is an object obstructing the view around a corner or curve, the engineer must work to ensure that drivers can see far enough to stop to avoid an accident or accelerate to join traffic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{road from}} Spanish Fork to Springville (leaving the latter on 800 North) {{was added to}} the state highway system in 1910, and in the 1920s it became part of SR-1 (US-91). In 1964, when SR-1 was moved to the newly {{completed}} I-15 in the area, the old route between Spanish Fork and Springville became an extension of SR-156 (which had been created in 1962 as a short connection between old and new SR-1 at exit 257). In 1992, because of safety problems at [...] "Maggie's Bend", where SR-156 turned from 800 North onto Childs Road in eastern Spanish Fork, caused in part by <b>superelevation</b> of the curve, 800 North was given to the city and the state took over Childs Road. This split SR-156 in two (with the original section, serving as a spur since 1964, becoming part of the mainline), and the portion on Childs Road and to Springville became a new State Route 51.|$|E
50|$|Normally, {{passenger}} trains run above the balancing speed, {{and the difference}} between the balancing <b>superelevation</b> for the speed and curvature and the actual <b>superelevation</b> on the curve is known as unbalanced <b>superelevation.</b> Track <b>superelevation</b> is usually limited to 6 in, and is often lower on routes with slow heavy freight trains in order to reduce wear on the inner rail. Track unbalanced <b>superelevation</b> in the U.S. is restricted to 3 in, though 6 in is permissible by waiver. There is no hard maximum set for European railways, some of which have curves with over 11 in of unbalanced <b>superelevation</b> to permit high-speed transportation.|$|E
50|$|If the <b>superelevation</b> {{determined}} for {{a dedicated}} passenger route curve on regulatory and safety bases is below 6 in {{it may be}} desirable to increase the <b>superelevation</b> and reduced the cant deficiency. However, if on such a curve some trains regularly travel at low speeds, then raising the <b>superelevation</b> may be inadvisable for passenger comfort reasons.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, the {{required}} cant gradient on a transition curve to achieve smooth connection between <b>superelevation</b> of curved track and the zero crosslevel of tangent track is called <b>superelevation</b> runoff. In {{addition to the}} runoff specification, the regulations related to allowable rate {{of change in the}} cant is also part of the general specification on the rate of change in crosslevel called warp parameter. The warp parameter and <b>superelevation</b> runoff help calculate {{the required}} length of the runoff for a transition curve.|$|E
