5|$|The {{decision}} to tour {{in support of}} the album was made before it was even complete. Early rehearsals were chaotic; Mason and Wright were completely out of practice, and realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to take charge. Matters were complicated when Waters contacted several US promoters, and threatened to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the <b>start-up</b> <b>costs</b> (Mason, separated from his wife, used his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral). Some promoters were offended by Waters' threat, and several months later 60,000 tickets went on sale in Toronto, selling out within hours.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, machinability, heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly {{dependent on the}} temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time. The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high <b>start-up</b> <b>costs.</b> Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|Waters {{attempted}} {{to subvert the}} Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the <b>start-up</b> <b>costs</b> with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured throughout North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained {{the right to use}} the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall.|$|E
3000|$|The {{objective}} of the proposed model is to minimize the operation cost of the whole system, which contains generation <b>cost</b> and <b>start-up</b> <b>cost.</b> Generation cost can be depicted by linear function, quadratic function or piecewise function, and quadratic function is adopted in this model due to its accuracy and differentiability.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  2, after the demand {{response}} is implemented, the total operation {{cost of the}} system decreases by $ 33720 (5.4  %). In detail, the <b>start-up</b> <b>cost</b> and fuel cost both decrease and the <b>start-up</b> <b>cost</b> decreases dramatically {{in the case of}} the descending percentage. The reason of the cost drop is clear. In the study, demand response adjusts the customer demand to overcome the intermittent of the wind power, which smoothes the power demand of the system from the conventional units. Smooth demand profile means less start-up times and less <b>start-up</b> <b>cost.</b> Furthermore, less <b>start-up</b> times indicate more opportunities to utilize the efficient units because an efficient unit cannot start up immediately once it shuts down. Thus, the total fuel cost also decreases.|$|R

40|$|It {{is nearly}} half a decade since the Goods and Services Tax (GST) 1 was {{introduced}} in Australia on 1 July 2000. Since then, most of the Australian tax reform issues still {{continue to be a}} "political play". The government presented tax simplification as one of the related objectives of the tax reform. However, much of the concern from businesses, in particular, small business community, was on both GST start-up and recurrent compliance <b>costs.</b> Presently, <b>start-up</b> tax compliance <b>costs</b> of the GST may no longer be an important issue since they are mostly regarded as "sunk costs" that can never be recovered. Moreover, businesses are now focusing on GST recurrent compliance <b>costs.</b> Nonetheless, <b>start-up</b> compliance <b>costs</b> of any taxation system/regulation cannot be ignored as they are important for policy makers. Empirical evidence suggests that overall <b>start-up</b> tax compliance <b>costs</b> are significant and regressive. 2 Furthermore, international findings also indicate that <b>start-up</b> compliance <b>costs</b> represent a significant amount of recurrent compliance costs. 3 The taxation literature on <b>start-up</b> compliance <b>costs</b> is very limited, although non-taxation studies on <b>start-up</b> compliance <b>costs</b> do shed some light on the topic. The major objective {{of this article is to}} discuss the possible relationship between <b>start-up</b> compliance <b>costs</b> and recurrent compliance costs of the GST.

25|$|Oil sands {{operations}} {{differ from}} conventional oil {{in that the}} initial profitability is somewhat lower, but the geological and political risks are low, the reserves are vast, and the expected lifetime of production extends for generations rather than just a few years.

From the standpoint of federal-provincial revenues, they also differ in that the federal government will receive larger higher share and higher return on its incentives than it would from conventional oil, while the provincial share, although substantial, will be proportionally smaller. Consequently, there has tended to be much less intergovernmental conflict and more agreement on how these projects should be handled.|$|E

Although small business GST <b>start-up</b> compliance <b>costs</b> were high, after around {{three years of the}} GST implementation, some small businesses reported managerial benefits. The results of structured face to face interviews with thirteen small business participants showed that overall, estimated average small business managerial benefit was $ 4, 639 per small business.

[...] Defense Secretary Robert Gates had production halted at 187 F-22s (at a cost of $67 billion) to direct funds for ongoing irregular warfare operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. [...] Since then, lawmakers and the Pentagon noted that air warfare systems of Russia and China were catching up to U.S. air superiority capabilities. Previous estimates of restarting production placed figures at around $2 billion, including $300–500 million in non-recurring <b>start-up</b> <b>costs,</b> with an estimated unit cost of $233 million for a production run of 75 aircraft over five years.

500|$|Grand Met {{also made}} several moves {{in an attempt}} to broaden BK's {{business}} operations while expanding its presence globally. The first move by the company was the creation of the BK Expressway business concept, a new store format designed for locations where a traditional stand-alone restaurant was impractical. The company introduced two separate formats designed to operate in different business environments; the first concept was intended as a kiosk-type store that would be placed in locations such as sports venues and airports. The second concept store, designed with two drive-thrus and a minimal or even non-existent dining room, was designed to go in locations that were limited by high land costs or limited space. Both types of these new, smaller stores operated with a condensed menu prepared on new equipment designed specifically for the more compact footprints of the new locations. Expressway locations were also designed with lower <b>start-up</b> <b>costs</b> in mind; franchisees were wooed with the promise of a much smaller investment, approximately one third as much, than would be required to open a more traditional location. In August of the same year, Grand Met set about expanding Burger King's operations in Europe by acquiring UK-based United Biscuits restaurant operations, including the nearly 400-location burger chain Wimpy. With the purchase, described as a [...] "rare opportunity" [...] by CEO Sheppard, Grand Met set about converting certain Wimpy locations that employed a counter service system into Burger King locations. The merger of the United Biscuits properties with BK grew the company from about 30 restaurants in the UK to more than 60 within a year of the purchase, with another 30 locations added in early 1990. While other [...] "Wimpy" [...] locations are still in operation presently, they are now independent from BK and no longer have the presence they once did.|$|E
