The workers brought families who integrated their culture into Welsh society, bringing with them Italian ice cream and Italian cafes, now a <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> Welsh society.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the novel was {{considered}} a classic for primary school children in the UK, and in the United States it was a <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> high-school suggested reading lists. Modern critics consider the book's worldview to be dated and imperialist, but although less popular today, The Coral Island was adapted into a four-part children's television drama broadcast by ITV in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs {{have been}} a <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> popular culture {{for as long as}} their cousins the dinosaurs, though they are usually not {{featured}} as prominently in films, literature or other art. Additionally, while the depiction of dinosaurs in popular media has changed radically in response to advances in paleontology, a mainly outdated picture of pterosaurs has persisted since the mid 20th century.|$|E

Games featuring the Wisps include Sonic Generations (2011), Sonic Lost World (2013), and Sonic Forces (2017). The story of Sonic Colors was adapted in Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series.|$|E
5|$|The album embraces {{a form of}} {{symbolism}} {{that would}} eventually become a <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> Morrison's songs, equating earthly love and heaven, or as close as a living being can approach it. Morrison and Davis's upright bass {{can be interpreted as}} the earth opposing Kay's percussion and the string arrangement representing heaven and with Berliner's lead acoustic guitar residing on a plane in between.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, Sunday {{began to}} conduct {{meetings}} (usually {{longer than a}} month) in small cities like Youngstown, Wilkes-Barre, South Bend, and Denver, and then finally, between 1915 and 1917, the major cities of Philadelphia, Syracuse, Kansas City, Detroit, Boston, Buffalo, and New York City. During the 1910s, Sunday was front page news in the cities where he held campaigns. Newspapers often printed his sermons in full, and during World War I, local coverage of his campaigns often surpassed that of the war. Sunday {{was the subject of}} over sixty articles in major periodicals, and he was a <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> the religious press regardless of denomination.|$|E

5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both Swedish and American, the Swedish-American community retained a fascination {{for the old}} country {{and their relationship to}} it. The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from these trips formed a <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts testify to complex feelings, but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish disrespect for women. It was with renewed pride in American culture that they returned to the Midwest.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Sid Meier {{released}} Civilization and popularized {{the level}} of detail {{that has become a}} <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> the genre. Sid Meier's Civilization was influenced by board games such as Risk and the Avalon Hill board game also called Civilization. A notable similarity between the Civilization computer game and board game is the importance of diplomacy and technological advancement. Sid Meier's Civilization was also influenced by personal computer games such as the city management game SimCity and the wargame Empire. Civilization became widely successful and influenced many 4X games to come.|$|E
5|$|Kirby's Dream Land {{has since}} spawned dozens of sequels across {{more than a}} half-dozen video game consoles. The first direct sequel Kirby's Adventure, {{released}} on the Nintendo Entertainment System, introduced the ability to steal powers from enemies, an ability which would become a <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> the series following it. The series has featured several spin-offs, in differing genres including a racing game Kirby Air Ride, pinball game Kirby's Pinball Land, and even an Action-Golf hybrid game Kirby's Dream Course. Kirby's Dream Land would receive a Game Boy sequel in 1995 Kirby's Dream Land 2, which incorporated the copy mechanic from Kirby's Adventure.|$|E

5|$|Lemoine's work defined many of {{the noted}} traits of this movement. His Géométrographie and {{relation}} of equations to tetrahedrons and triangles, {{as well as his}} study of concurrencies and concyclities, contributed to the modern triangle geometry of the time. The definition of points of the triangle such as the Lemoine point was also a <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> the geometry, and other modern triangle geometers such as Brocard and Gaston Tarry wrote about similar points.|$|E
5|$|Other stories include {{recollections}} {{about the}} dress purchased for the {{date with a}} guy who subsequently married someone else; the foibles of spandex bras that result in a look known as the monoboob; issues involving toe cleavage; the Juicy Couture tracksuit that is a prominent <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> California wardrobes; wardrobe choice on the wrong day of the month; and the story about an incarcerated lover and the strategic hole in a certain pair of pants.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after making}} {{the choice to}} include {{electronic}} drums and triggers, Peart added what has become another trademark of his kit: a rotating drum riser. During live Rush shows the riser allows Peart to swap the prominent portions of the kit (traditional acoustic in front, electronic in back). A <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> Peart's live drum solos has been the in-performance rotation-and-swap of {{the front and back}} kits as part of the solo itself. This special effect provides both a symbolic transition of drum styles within the solo and a visual treat for the audience.|$|E

5|$|Synge's plays {{helped to}} set the {{dominant}} style of plays at the Abbey Theatre until the 1940s. The stylised realism of his writing {{was reflected in the}} training given at the theatre's school of acting, and plays of peasant life were the main <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> the repertoire {{until the end of the}} 1950s. Sean O'Casey, the next major dramatist to write for the Abbey, knew Synge's work well and attempted to do for the Dublin working classes what Synge had done for the rural poor. Brendan Behan, Brinsley MacNamara, and Lennox Robinson were all indebted to Synge.|$|E
5|$|The advancements in portraying {{realistic}} emotions {{achieved with}} Final Fantasy X through voice-overs and detailed facial expressions have since become a <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> the series, with Final Fantasy X-2 and other subsequent titles (such as , Final Fantasy XII, XIII and its sequels, and XV) also featuring this development. Traversing real-time 3D environments {{instead of an}} overworld map has also become a standard of the series, as demonstrated in Final Fantasy XI, XII, XIII and its sequels, XIV and XV. Final Fantasy X {{can be considered a}} pioneer in 3-D RPG maps.|$|E
5|$|The {{developer}} and {{producer of the}} original Metroid for the Nintendo Entertainment System – Nintendo Research & Development 1 (Nintendo R) and Gunpei Yokoi – returned to develop Metroid II. The developers of the game added round metal shoulders on Samus' Varia Suit to differentiate it from her Power Suit, since both looked similar on the Game Boy's limited greyscale display. The updated suit has since been a <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> the series, appearing in all subsequent games. A unique color palette for Metroid II {{was added to the}} Game Boy Color console, a successor to the original Game Boy with a color screen.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} 4X games borrowed {{ideas from}} board games and 1970s text-based computer games. The first 4X computer games were turn-based, but real-time 4X games are not uncommon. Many 4X computer games {{were published in}} the mid-1990s, but were later outsold by other types of strategy games. Sid Meier's Civilization is an important example from this formative era, and popularized the level of detail that later became a <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> the genre. In the new millennium, several 4X releases have become critically and commercially successful.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting of}} the main series is a Northern European-style dark fantasy world where humans and creatures from myth and legends live side by side, while the {{spin-off}} game is set in an alternative reality leading {{from one of the}} first game's possible endings. The stories generally focus on the fortunes and personalities {{of a small group of}} protagonists either directly or indirectly connected to and affected by the events of the story. Dark or mature plot and character themes and multiple endings have become a <b>staple</b> <b>of</b> the series. Their popularity in Japan has resulted in multiple adaptions and additional media in the form of novelizations and manga.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Sonic Colors {{received}} positive reviews. Critics {{recommended the}} title for its graphics, audio, gameplay, replay value, and considered {{it to be}} an improvement over previous installments.
