40|$|Avulsion {{fracture}} of the tibial eminence {{is rare in}} children. This report describes {{a case of a}} 9 -year-old boy who had been treated previously with an epiphyseal cannulated <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer,</b> but without notchplasty, for an avulsion {{fracture of}} the tibial eminence. The patient subsequently presented with extension block and knee stif fness. After removal of the im-plants and manipulation, an iatrogenically-induced distal femur fracture was observed postoperatively with callus forma-tion noted at follow-up. This case serves to illustrate the importance of identifying and treating screw head impingement during f xation surgery, of avoiding vigorous manipulation during removal of f xation devices, and of consulting radio-graphs after any manipulation.

30|$|Traditionally, {{cannulated}} partially threaded cancellous screws {{have been}} used to fix larger fragments. However, these screws are often removed due to the risk of anterior impingement, fretting between the washer and screw, and potential damage to the articular surface [10, 16, 35]. In addition, this technique is not effective for cases in which a small or a comminuted tibial spine fragment occurs [1]. In one case series of 26 type II and III fractures treated with cannulated <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer,</b> four patients had anterior impingement due to ‘ledging’ of the fracture, and two of these patients needed ACL reconstructions within three years of their original surgery [10].

40|$|Posterior {{cruciate}} ligament (PCL) insertion-site osteochondral avulsions in children, {{particularly from the}} tibia, are not commonly seen by orthopaedic surgeons. Because of the rarity of these injuries, careful attention to the specific physical examination and imaging findings seen with these injuries is necessary so that the proper diagnosis can be made. Osteochondral avulsions of the PCL can be missed on plain radiographs in skeletally immature patients, and therefore magnetic resonance imaging is necessary for proper diagnosis. With this knowledge, clinicians can formulate treatment plans which can return their patients to activities while avoiding potential morbidity resulting from missed diagnoses or improper treatment. We report two rare cases of PCL insufficiency stemming from tibial insertion osteochondral avulsions. Both patients underwent subsequent open reduction and internal fixation of the avulsion using two different fixation methods (bioabsorbable anchors versus cannulated <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer)</b> and have returned to full sporting activities...|$|E

MÉTODOS: Um grupo de 265 pacientes submetidos à reconstrução do LCA com enxerto ipsilateral dos tendões flexores da coxa em que o método de fixação tibial do enxerto foi o parafuso cortical com arruela metálica entre seis de julho de 2000 e 19 de novembro de 2007. RESULTADO: 176 pacientes foram avaliados com uma média de 33, 3 ± 19, 5 meses (mediana de 29, 5 meses) (IIQ: 17 - 45 meses) - mínima de oito e máxima de 87 meses. Não houve diferença estatística ao analisar a queixa de dor no parafuso (p = 0, 272) e a necessidade de retirada do mesmo (p = 0, 633) entre os sexos. Não houve diferença estatística ao analisar a queixa de dor no parafuso (p = 0, 08) e a necessidade de retirada do mesmo (p = 0, 379) ao analisar o IMC. CONCLUSÕES: A utilização do parafuso e arruela metálica para fixação tibial na reconstrução do LCA demonstrou um índice de queixa de dor no sítio do parafuso na ordem de 25 % e necessidade de sua retirada em 10, 8 % dos casos.

40|$|The {{attachment}} of {{soft tissue}} to bone remains {{an important part}} of the practice of orthopaedic surgery. The surgeon’s armamentarium for attaching ligaments, tendons, or other tissues to bone includes pullout suture techniques, keyhole techniques, smooth or barbed soft tissue staples, <b>and</b> fixation with <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers.</b> 51 Each of these devices and techniques has advantages and disadvan-tages, depending on the surgical situation and the clinical application. The development of suture anchors and tacks, which have revolutionized soft tissue fixation to bone, has paral-leled the development of arthroscopic surgical techniques and is particularly applicable to surgical procedures for the shoulder joint. Suture anchors and tacks have been used successfully for rotator cuff repairs, shoulder reconstruc-tions for instability, the repair of biceps anchor lesions (eg, superior labrum anterior posterior [SLAP] lesions), and biceps tenodesis. The continuing evolution of suture anchors and tacks has produced a variety of types, such as absorbable, nonabsorbable, screw-in, hooked, and knotless anchors and tacks, as well as those that lock into the bone on insertion. Sutures, too, are available in several forms, including braided, unbraided, absorbable, nonabsorbable...|$|R

5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers</b> <b>and</b> prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|R

50|$|Lightship Baskets are woven {{from the}} bottom {{to the top and}} start with a solid wooden base that has a groove cut around the outside. The base is carved, sanded, and {{polished}} then attached {{to the top of a}} solid wood mould.

The staves are tapered at the top and soaked in water (rattan staves only require a brief dampening). The staves are then inserted into the groove cut into the base. An odd number of staves must always be used in order to allow the weaver to continue running down the basket, if an even number of staves were used the weaver would end up having to skip a stave. Generally baskets contain between 31 and 51 staves (although many baskets contain more, or fewer) with the stave width being relative to the size of the basket. The staves are kept tight onto the mould with a thick rubber band. A long thin piece of rattan is used as the weaver.|$|R

40|$|Background: Sufficient inter-fragmentary {{compression}} is help-ful {{to achieve}} successful bony fusion in hindfoot arthrodesis using internal fixation by screws. Beside bone quality, {{the design of}} a screw influences inter-fragmentary compression.

The work necessary to achieve compressive force for primary stability was measured for different <b>screw</b> systems <b>and</b> compared to an AO <b>screw</b> with <b>washer.</b> Materials <b>and</b> Methods: The compressive force was determined as a func-tion of screw advancement for 3 different cannulated screw types (7. 3 -mm AO <b>screw</b> with <b>and</b> without <b>washer,</b> the 6. 5 -mm Herbert <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> the 6. 5 -mm Ideal Compression Screw (I.

Symptomatic scapholunate instability has been corrected so far either by limited wrist fusion or by various techniques of soft tissue repair. Limited wrist fusion greatly reduces wrist motion and increases the probability of osteoarthritis in the remaining mobile wrist segments. On the other hand, most types of soft tissue repair are technically difficult to perform and have disappointing results due to the inherent laxity. The presented dynamic approach was used in 20 wrists of 19 patients with static scapholunate instability. Preoperative evaluation included in all patients clinical examination, radiologic evaluation, and arthroscopy for establishing the diagnosis of static scapholunate instability.
