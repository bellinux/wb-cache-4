5|$|While minor, Moore {{managed to}} earn much needed media {{interest}} in the later part of the election mostly due to John McCain's red baiting against Barack Obama and making {{an appeal to the}} 5th US Circuit Court to get ballot access in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana.</b> His media campaign included writing articles in several leading newspapers such as The New Republic and the National Journal and making appearances on television, most notably The Colbert Report.|$|E

5|$|Across the state, the {{hurricane}} damaged 23,000homes and destroyed 985homes and 1,951mobile homes; private property damage {{was estimated at}} $1billion. The high winds destroyed large areas of sugar and soybean crops, estimated at $289million in damage. Strong winds also left at least 230,000people without electricity. During the storm's passage, upwelling occurred in the Atchafalaya Basin and Bayou Lafourche, killing 187million freshwater fish. Damage to the fishing industry was estimated at $266million. Overall, losses in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana</b> reached approximately $1.56billion. A total of 17deaths occurred in Louisiana, 8directly and 9from indirect causes. At least 75injuries were reported.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Napoleon, {{not only was the}} Napoleonic Code {{retained}} by conquered countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, parts of Italy and Germany, but has been used as the basis of certain parts of law outside Europe including the Dominican Republic, the US <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana</b> and the Canadian province of Quebec. The memory of Napoleon in Poland is favorable, for his support for independence and opposition to Russia, his legal code, the abolition of serfdom, and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies.|$|E
5|$|In early September, {{officials}} announced that 1,400mobile homes, homes, and apartments would become available to residents whose dwellings became uninhabitable. House Resolution 5620 also included disaster {{aid to the}} <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana.</b> In early December, the Small Business Administration (SBA) approved $33.2million worth of low-interest loans for repairs to homes and businesses. By then, FEMA had received about 43,600 applications for aid, while approving $35.9million in grants to over 18,000 households that were ineligible for loans from the SBA or were uninsured. In addition to the mobile homes already provided, FEMA spent $22.6 million on disaster housing.|$|E

5|$|Within {{months of}} his {{admission}} to the bar, Benjamin argued his first case before the Supreme Court of Louisiana and won. Still, clients were slow to come in his first years in practice, and he had enough free time to compile and publish, with Thomas Slidell, the Digest of the Reported Decisions of the Superior Court of the Late Territory of Orleans and the Supreme Court of the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana</b> in 1834, which required the analysis of 6,000 cases. The book was an immediate success and helped launch Benjamin's career. When Slidell published a revised edition in 1840, he did so alone, as Benjamin was too busy trying cases {{to allow him to}} participate.|$|E
5|$|After {{the mint}} closed, it {{performed}} {{a variety of}} functions for the Federal government. It was first downgraded to an assay office for the U.S. Treasury {{as it had been}} from 1876 to 1879. Then, in 1932, the assay office closed and the building was converted into a Federal prison, in which capacity it served until 1943. The Coast Guard then took over the building as a nominal storage facility, though in truth the structure was largely abandoned and left to decay until it was transferred to the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana</b> in 1965. During the Cold War, when many believed there to be a high risk of nuclear war, the old Mint was considered to be the best fallout shelter in the city.|$|E
5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{has also}} suffered serious declines from hunting and habitat loss throughout its range, threatening it with extinction. In 1967 it {{was listed as}} an endangered species, but the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and state wildlife agencies in the Southern United States stepped in and worked towards its recovery. Protection allowed the species to recuperate, and in 1987 it {{was removed from the}} endangered species list. Much research into alligator ranching has been undertaken at the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, a large area of marshland in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana.</b> The resulting data has increased understanding of penning, stocking rates, egg incubation, hatching, rearing, and diet, and this information has been used at other establishments around the world. Income from the alligators kept at Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge contributes to conservation of the marshland. A study examining alligator farms in the United States showed that they have generated significant conservation gains, and poaching of wild alligators has greatly diminished.|$|E

5|$|The dish {{combines}} {{ingredients and}} culinary practices of several cultures, including French, Spanish, German, Filipino, West African, and Choctaw. Gumbo {{may have been}} based on traditional West African or native dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish bouillabaisse, or Choctaw stew, but most likely all three dishes contributed to the original recipe. It was first described in 1802, and was listed in various cookbooks {{in the latter half of}} the 19th century. The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the United States Senate dining room added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator Allen Ellender. The popularity of chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s spurred further interest in the dish. Gumbo is the official cuisine of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{great white}} pelican is the {{national}} bird of Romania. The brown pelican {{is the national}} bird of three Caribbean countries—Saint Kitts and Nevis, Barbados and Sint Maarten—and features on their coats of arms. It is also the state bird of the US <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana,</b> which is known colloquially as the Pelican State; the bird appears on the state flag and state seal. It adorns the seals of Louisiana State University and Tulane University, and is the mascot of the New Orleans Pelicans NBA team, Tulane University, and the University of the West Indies. A white pelican logo {{is used by the}} Portuguese bank Montepio Geral, and a pelican is depicted on the reverse of the Albanian 1 lek coin, issued in 1996. The name and image were used for Pelican Books, an imprint of non-fiction books published by Penguin Books. The seal of the Packer Collegiate Institute, a pelican feeding her young, has been in use since 1885.|$|E
5|$|The ritual form {{on which}} the Grand Orient of France was based was {{abolished}} in England in the events leading {{to the formation of}} the United Grand Lodge of England in 1813. However the two jurisdictions continued in amity (mutual recognition) until events of the 1860s and 1870s drove a seemingly permanent wedge between them. In 1868 the Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana</b> appeared in the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, recognised by the Grand Orient de France, but regarded by the older body as an invasion of their jurisdiction. The new Scottish rite body admitted blacks, and the resolution of the Grand Orient the following year that neither colour, race, nor religion could disqualify a man from Masonry prompted the Grand Lodge to withdraw recognition, and it persuaded other American Grand Lodges to do the same.|$|E

The unit de Peyster had originally joined, the 13th New York, was also assigned in the XXV Corps. He is credited with raising the first Union flag over the Confederate capitol of Richmond, Virginia after its fall.
