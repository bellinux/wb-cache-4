50|$|Whilst {{this type}} of running gear did not catch on with the state railway or more {{generally}} within Europe, several advantages to the American <b>sectional</b> <b>frame</b> were identified, including better accessibility to an internally arranged running gear. As a result, {{this type of}} frame was also made use of on the batch of ten S 2/5 locomotives built by Maffei in 1904 {{as well as all}} later Bavarian four-cylinder compound locomotives. However, they differed from their American counterparts in that they were given inside cylinders and a cranked axle.|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} nonlinear {{finite element}} for thin beams is proposed within the absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF). The deformation of the element {{is described by}} means of displacement vector, axial slope and axial rotation parameter per node. The element {{is based on the}} Bernoulli–Euler theory and can undergo coupled axial extension, bending and torsion in the large deformation case. Singularities – which are typically caused by such parameterizations – are overcome by a director per element node. Once the directors are properly defined, a cross <b>sectional</b> <b>frame</b> is defined at any point of the beam axis. Since the director is updated during computation, no singularities occur. The proposed element is a three-dimensional ANCF Bernoulli–Euler beam element free of singularities and without transverse slope vectors. Detailed convergence analysis by means of various numerical static and dynamic examples and comparison to analytical solutions shows the performance and accuracy of the element...|$|E

50|$|The Corner Lunch {{is located}} in {{southern}} Worcester, {{at the corner of}} Lamartine and Lafayette Streets, just east of Quinsigamond Avenue. It is a single-story <b>sectional</b> steel <b>frame</b> structure, whose exterior is clad in steel with green enamel bands. It is nine bays wide and five deep, with a rounded section at its southeast corner. An entrance vestibule projects from the front facade, with green panels set in steel framing. The interior has a replacement plastic laminate counter, with a central staff access section, and fifteen counter seats mounted on steel columns. Booths line the front wall, and there is banquette seating along the south side.|$|R

CFS sectional members are combined and used as a primary load bearing members on medium span structures. However use of combined CFS members on medium span portal frames in Sri Lanka is limited {{due to lack of}} knowledge. This research is to design and analyze the feasibility of using back to back CFS lipped channels on industrial portal framed building. There were 16 nos. models selected with varying spans of 6 m, 9 m, 12 m and 15 m, heights 4 m and 6 m and bay distance 4 m and 6 m. The models were first analyzed with computer analysis software called PROKON and optimum sections of back to back combined CFS lipped channels were selected so that it’s serviceability conditions were satisfied. Further the selected section sizes were revised until it’s combined moment and compression overall buckling criteria () () is satisfied. The major feasibility was carried through cost analysis with compared to hot rolled <b>sectional</b> portal <b>frames</b> are being constructed in Sri Lanka’s western region. Therefore the wind speed kept as constant of 140 km/hr (Maximum wind speed in western region). Out of 16 nos. models 14 nos. models shows cost effective ad saving on cost varied from 14 % to 21. 5 % and an average of 12. 5 %. 4 m bay distance is economical than 6 m bay distance. 12 m span is found to be the most economical span in these models...|$|R
40|$|The type of {{mathematical}} modeling {{selected for the}} optimum design problems of steel skeletal frames affects the size and mathematical complexity of the programming problem obtained. Survey on the structural optimization literature reveals that there are basically two types of design optimization formulation. In the first type only cross <b>sectional</b> properties of <b>frame</b> members are taken as design variables. In such formulation when the values of design variables change during design cycles, it becomes necessary to analyze the structure and update the response of steel frame to the external loading. Structural analysis in this type is a complementary part of the design process. In the second type joint coordinates are also treated as design variables {{in addition to the}} cross sectional properties of members. Such formulation eliminates the necessity of carrying out structural analysis in every design cycle. The values of the joint displacements are determined by the optimization techniques in addition to cross sectional properties. The structural optimization literature contains structural design algorithms that make use of both type of formulation. In this study a review is carried out on mathematical and metaheuristic algorithms where the effect of the mathematical modeling on the efficiency of these algorithms is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{amputation}} of a {{lower limb}} represents a significant physical, practical and emotional challenge for the amputee, their family and services aiming to assist them. Previous {{research has indicated that}} psychosocial variables such as satisfaction with social support and active coping may be of importance in facilitating adjustment to amputation. However, studies published to date have been almost exclusively cross <b>sectional</b> and have <b>framed</b> adjustment in negative terms (e. g., the absence of depression). The current study aims to build on previous research by examining prospectively demographic, amputation-related and psychosocial variables. Adjustment is conceptualized as subjective and is positively framed. Furthermore, the role of hope, a cognitive model from the field of positive psychology, is examined for its unique contribution to adjustment over other variables. Ninety-nine lower limb amputees were recruited and completed measures of social support, active coping and hope at the beginning of rehabilitation. At six-month follow up participants completed measures of positive affect and subjective adjustment. Analyses of the data confirm the importance of psychosocial variables in predicting adjustment to lower limb amputation. Social support, active coping and hope were all significantly correlated with outcome. Hope made a unique contribution to the prediction of positive mood in lower limb amputees. Conclusions are drawn concerning the clinical implications of the findings and suggestions made for future research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{reinforced}} concrete structure {{with and without}} infill wall {{has been done by}} modeling the same structure as open frame (OF) and infilled frame (RDP) to compare in their stiffness, force distribution and dimensional changes. In RDP model, the wall is modeled as equivalent diagonal struts with one, two and three struts. Seven-storey building structure is taken as a reference and structures of 4 and 10 floors are used as comparison. To observe the effect of wall discontinuity at ground level additional 4 models were made for the 7 storey building by removing one, four, six, and all nine walls at ground level (RDP 7 S 3 SS 1, RDP 7 S 3 SS 2, RDP 7 S 3 SS 3, and RDP 7 S 3 SS 4). For seven-storey model, RDP structures with one, two, and three struts have a comparable lateral stiffness but it tends to increase for model with many struts. Compared to OF, RDP structure with one, two, and three struts have smaller lateral deformation with ratio 0, 655; 0, 636, and 0, 612, respectively. Bending moment, shear and axial in the frame of RDP are also smaller than those of OF with ratio 0, 223 and 0, 916. RDP model with 3 struts gives better force distribution on the frame compared to the model with single strut. Removing all walls at ground level produce inter storey drift ratio of 4, which is a soft storey phenomenon. On the 4, 7, and 10 storey variation the lateral deformation ratio for RDP and OF are 0, 547; 0, 612, and 0, 581, respectively. The cross <b>sectional</b> area of <b>frame</b> for RDP is as low as 40 % compared to that of OF. </p...|$|R
