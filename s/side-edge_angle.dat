40|$|A {{water tunnel}} study {{examining}} {{the influence of}} forebody cross section on {{the position of the}} wing vortex burst was carried out in the NASA Ames-Dryden water tunnel for a 55 -deg cropped delta-wing model. Two of three cross sections investigated were chine-shaped, where the included angle of the chine was either 7. 5 -deg, representing a rather small <b>side-edge</b> <b>angle,</b> or 90 deg, representing a more moderate design. The third cross section was circular and served as a baseline for comparison. It is found that the 7. 5 deg chine cross section generated the strongest forebody vortices of the three configurations and that these strong forebody vortices interacted with the main wing vortices in such a manner as to dramatically delay wing vortex burst position at zero sideslip. If the configuration is sideslipped, large asymmetries in wing vortex burst location may result...|$|E
