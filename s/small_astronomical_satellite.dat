40|$|ABRIXAS is a <b>small</b> <b>astronomical</b> <b>satellite</b> {{planned by}} the Astrophysical Institute Potsdam (AIP) and the German Space Agency DARA. Its main {{scientific}} {{objective is to}} survey the total hemisphere; the satellite rotates once per orbit along the sun line, and after half a year the sur-vey mission will be fulfilled. The attitude control system {{is one of the}} most critical subsystems with respect to cost and mission success, and an independent study was done. With a momen-tum biased system, three magnetic torquers and a sun sensor the mission requirement of 10 arc-minutes accuracy can be achieved, if the torquer current is controlled by an analogous driver unit. Using the BREM-SAT simulation software (which has been verified by flight results), the "onboard " software module had been developed and tested thoroughly. For the momentum wheel discharge new procedures had to be developed which work even at equatorial orbits. As a result of this study, hardware cost reduction and early software implementation and testing had become possible...|$|E
50|$|During her {{employment}} at NASA, Roman developed and budgeted various programs, and organized their scientific participation. She {{was involved in}} launching three Orbiting Solar Observatories and three <b>Small</b> <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Satellites.</b> These satellites used ultraviolet and x-ray technology for observing the sun, space and sky. She also oversaw the launches of other Orbiting Astronomical Observatories that used optical and ultraviolet measurements, working with Dixon Ashworth. Her other launches included four Geodetic satellites. She planned for other smaller {{programs such as the}} Astronomy Rocket Program, High Energy Astronomy Observatories, the Scout Probe to measure the relativistic gravity redshift and other experiments on Spacelab, Gemini, Apollo and Skylab. Roman worked with Jack Holtz, too, on the Small Astronomy Satellite and Don Burrowbridge on Space Telescope.|$|R
40|$|A coordinated {{program to}} explore Halley's comet in 1985 to 86 is proposed. The program employs {{a variety of}} {{observational}} systems for remote observations and utilizes spacecraft encounters with the comet to obtain in-situ measurements. Included in the observational network are groundbased observatories, the Space Telescope, a Spacelab cometary observatory, <b>small</b> <b>astronomical</b> <b>satellites,</b> and experiments carried on airborne observatories and sounding rockets. It is assumed that a ballistic flythrough technique {{will be used to}} carry out the spacecraft encounters. The proposed strategy calls for the simultaneous launch of two spacecraft towards an intercept with Halley in March 1986. Following the Halley encounter one spacecraft is retargeted to intercept comet Borrelly in January 1988, while the other spacecraft proceeds to an encounter with comet Tempel 2 in September 1988...|$|R
