25|$|Let r(t) be a vector that {{describes}} {{the position of a}} point mass as a function of time. <b>Since</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> assuming circular motion, let r(t) = R·ur, where R is a constant (the radius of the circle) and ur is the unit vector pointing from the origin to the point mass. The direction of ur is described by θ, the angle between the x-axis and the unit vector, measured counterclockwise from the x-axis. The other unit vector for polar coordinates, uθ is perpendicular to ur and points in the direction of increasing θ. These polar unit vectors can be expressed in terms of Cartesian unit vectors in the x and y directions, denoted i and j respectively: and uθ depend on θ, and so in general have non-zero time derivatives.|$|E

2500|$|The idea of handle {{trading is}} to create a {{cancelling}} pair of (k+1)- and (k+2)-handles so that a given k-handle cancels with the (k+1)-handle leaving behind the (k+2)-handle. To do this, consider the core of the k-handle which is an element in [...] This group is trivial since W is an h-cobordism. Thus, there is a disk [...] which we can fatten to a cancelling pair as desired, so long as we can embed this disk into the boundary of W. This embedding exists if [...] <b>Since</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> assuming n is at least 5 this means that k is either 0 or 1. Finally, by considering the negative of the given Morse function, −f, we can turn the handle decomposition upside down and also remove the n- and (n+1)-handles as desired.|$|E
2500|$|However {{given that}} the {{location}} of different NMR signals {{is dependent on the}} external magnetic field strength and the reference frequency, the signals are usually reported relative to a reference signal, usually that of TMS (tetramethylsilane). Additionally, since the distribution of NMR signals is field dependent, these frequencies are divided by the spectrometer frequency. However, <b>since</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> dividing Hz by MHz, the resulting number would be too small, and thus it is multiplied by a million. This operation therefore gives a locator number called the [...] "chemical shift" [...] with units of parts per million. In general, chemical shifts for protons are highly predictable since the shifts are primarily determined by simpler shielding effects (electron density), but the chemical shifts for many heavier nuclei are more strongly influenced by other factors including excited states ("paramagnetic" [...] contribution to shielding tensor).|$|E
