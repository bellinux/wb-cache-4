25|$|The SM {{combines}} many {{unusual and}} innovative features, {{some of which}} are only just becoming commonplace on cars of today. It borrows heavily from the innovations introduced on the DS, by including hydro-pneumatic (oleo pneumatic) <b>self-leveling</b> suspension, and <b>self-leveling</b> lights that swiveled with the steering (except in the USA where these were illegal at the time).|$|E
25|$|Cruise ships use {{gyroscopes}} {{to level}} motion-sensitive {{devices such as}} <b>self-leveling</b> pool tables.|$|E
25|$|The Music Hall is a 2-story lounge on decks 3 and 4 {{that also}} serves as a nightclub and small music {{performance}} venue. The Music Hall features the <b>self-leveling</b> pool tables first seen on the Radiance-class ships.|$|E
25|$|In Europe and {{the many}} non-European {{countries}} applying ECE Regulations, even HID headlamps designed as such must be equipped with lens cleaning and automatic <b>self-leveling</b> systems, except on motorcycles. These systems are usually absent on vehicles not originally equipped with HID lamps.|$|E
25|$|The Model S has {{independent}} {{coil spring}} suspension {{on all four}} wheels front double wishbone, virtual steer axis control arm and rear independent multilink. As an extra-cost option, the car is available with <b>self-leveling,</b> height-adjustable air suspension. This is accomplished via adjustable Bilstein shock absorbers controlled by the driver. The car is meant to lower itself at highway speed and raise itself to traverse steep driveways and rough terrain, despite the low 6-inch ground clearance and rather long 116-inch wheelbase.|$|E
25|$|Front {{suspension}} uses {{a separate}} spring and damper {{with a rubber}} top mount. The rear suspension of the W124 features the Mercedes multi-link axle introduced in 1982 with the Mercedes 190 and which is now standard on many modern cars. Estate cars (and optionally, saloons and coupés) had Citroen-like rear <b>self-leveling</b> suspension with suspension struts rather than shock absorbers, gas-filled suspension spheres to provide damping and an under bonnet pressurizing pump. Unlike the traditional Citroën application Mercedes opted for a fixed ride height and employed rear coil springs to maintain the static ride height when parked.|$|E
25|$|Internationalized ECE Regulation 48, {{in force}} {{in most of}} the world outside North America, {{currently}} specifies a limited range within which the vertical aim of the headlamps must be maintained under various vehicle load conditions; if the vehicle isn't equipped with an adaptive suspension sufficient to keep the headlamps aimed correctly regardless of load, a headlamp leveling system is required. The regulation stipulates a more stringent version of this anti-glare measure if the vehicle has headlamps with low beam light source(s) that produce more than 2,000 lumens – xenon bulbs and certain high-power halogens, for example. Such vehicles must be equipped with headlamp <b>self-leveling</b> systems that sense the vehicle's degree of squat due to cargo load and road inclination, and automatically adjust the headlamps' vertical aim to keep the beam correctly oriented without any action required by the driver.|$|E
25|$|Fly ash is {{also used}} as a {{component}} {{in the production of}} flowable fill (also called controlled low strength material, or CLSM), which is used as <b>self-leveling,</b> self-compact backfill material in lieu of compacted earth or granular fill. The strength of flowable fill mixes can range from 50 to 1,200 lbf/in² (0.3 to 8.3 MPa), depending on the design requirements of the project in question. Flowable fill includes mixtures of Portland cement and filler material, and can contain mineral admixtures. Fly ash can replace either the Portland cement or fine aggregate (in most cases, river sand) as a filler material. High fly ash content mixes contain nearly all fly ash, with a small percentage of Portland cement and enough water to make the mix flowable. Low fly ash content mixes contain a high percentage of filler material, and a low percentage of fly ash, Portland cement, and water. Class F fly ash is best suited for high fly ash content mixes, whereas Class C fly ash is almost always used in low fly ash content mixes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{store was}} rebuilt, and in 1893, renamed Malley-Neeley Co.. [...] The name was changed a final time to The Edw. Malley Co. in 1898, and {{enlarged}} in 1899 as a nine-story Beaux-Arts style building. [...] It continued to remodel and improve, adding New England's first <b>self-leveling</b> elevator in 1923, and escalators in 1958. [...] A 1938 travel book said of Malley's, [...] "Young shoppers are {{fascinated by the}} big cage of live birds in the children's department." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upward-looking {{hemispherical}} {{photographs are}} typically acquired under uniform sky lighting, early or {{late in the}} day or under overcast conditions. [...] Known orientation (zenith and azimuth) is essential for proper registration with the analysis hemispherical coordinate system. [...] Even lighting is essential for accurate image classification. [...] A <b>self-leveling</b> mount (gimbals) can facilitate acquisition by ensuring that the camera is oriented to point straight up toward the zenith. [...] The camera is typically oriented such that north (absolute or magnetic) is oriented toward the top of the photograph.|$|E
2500|$|Radiance-class ships have a {{gross tonnage}} of 90,090. All ships have {{environmentally}} friendlier gas turbine engines. The Radiance-class ships have over [...] of glass, glass exterior viewing elevators, over 700 balcony staterooms, two-level glass windowed dining rooms, alternative restaurants, a retractable glass roof over a pool, an outdoor pool, {{as well as}} the first <b>self-leveling</b> billiard tables at sea. The Radiance class ships were constructed at Meyer Werft, Papenburg, Germany. Unlike the preceding Voyager class, these ships are built to the Panamax form factor, allowing them to pass through the Panama Canal.|$|E
2500|$|The Quantum-class {{of ships}} debuted {{as the second}} largest class of cruise ships in the world. The Quantum-class ships were the first ships built for Royal Caribbean by Meyer Werft since the Radiance class and share many {{features}} with those ships, including indoor pools with retractable roofs, vast expanses of glass, outdoor seating in the Windjammer buffet, and <b>self-leveling</b> pool tables. Other distinctive features of the Quantum-class include the [...] "North Star" [...] observation capsule mounted {{on the end of}} a [...] crane arm, [...] "RipCord by iFLY" [...] a skydiving simulator, the three-deck-high Two70° lounge and performance venue at the aft of the ship featuring panoramic windows that convert into projection screens, and the multi-purpose SeaPlex facility which hosts activities such as basketball, roller skating, bumper cars, and a trapeze school. The Quantum class was the first class designed specifically for Dynamic Dining, and feature several separate complementary dining facilities instead of a single main dining room. [...] Each venue will maintain the same menu and staff throughout the cruise. Unlike the earlier Voyager, Freedom, and Oasis class, Quantum-class ships do not feature a Viking Crown Lounge or ice skating rink, and the Royal Promenade mall down the center of the ship is not featured in its traditional form.|$|E
60|$|Here {{was more}} mystery, more food for reflection. Only a {{powerful}} motive or a <b>self-leveling</b> love {{could have made}} a woman of Diane Sampson's pride ask such a question. Whatever her reason, I determined to assure her, once and forever, what I knew to be true. Accordingly, I told her in unforgettable words, with my own regard for her and love for Sally filling my voice with emotion, how I could see that Steele loved her, how madly he was destined to love her, how terribly hard that was going to make his work in Linrock.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>self-leveling</b> {{was coined}} in the United States by ARDEX, Inc. in 1978 in {{reference}} to their first <b>self-leveling</b> product, ARDEX K 15 Premium <b>Self-Leveling</b> Concrete Underlayment. The term was used to differentiate it from traditional concrete, which is typically stiffer and requires more labor to get it into place and finish with a trowel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Self-leveling</b> {{suspension}} {{systems are}} designed to maintain a constant ride height regardless of load. Vehicles not equipped with <b>self-leveling</b> will pitch down at one end when laden; this adversely affects ride, handling, and aerodynamic properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Self-leveling</b> {{concrete}} is polymer-modified cement {{that has}} high flow characteristics and, {{in contrast to}} traditional concrete, {{does not require the}} addition of excessive amounts of water for placement. <b>Self-leveling</b> concrete is typically used to create a flat and smooth surface with a compressive strength similar to or higher than that of traditional concrete prior to installing interior floor coverings. <b>Self-leveling</b> concrete has increased in popularity as the degree of flatness and smoothness required for floor covering products has increased, with vinyl goods becoming thinner and floor tiles becoming larger, for example.|$|E

50|$|When <b>self-leveling</b> {{concrete}} is poured, {{it has a}} viscosity {{similar to}} pancake batter. A gauge rake is used to move it into place without spreading it too thin. The finishing is then done by lightly breaking the surface tension of the product using a tool called a smoother. The polymers in the <b>self-leveling</b> mix keep the viscosity of the product such that it remains uniform in composition {{from top to bottom}} without the sand aggregates sinking {{to the bottom of the}} installed layer. The typical installation thickness of these products is about 0.25 inches to ensure there is enough mass present for the material to flow, although some <b>self-leveling</b> products now exist that can be installed at an average thickness of only 0.125 inches.|$|E
