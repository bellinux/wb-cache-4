5|$|Vettel {{was again}} fastest in third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, narrowly ahead of Hamilton's Mercedes. Before all drivers {{were able to}} set times on the super-soft tyres, Fernando Alonso coming to {{a stop on the}} start/finish straight brought out a red flag, halting the session. When practice resumed, rain had <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall,</b> preventing the drivers from improving on their times. Only Force India driver Sergio Pérez set a lap on the faster tyre compound, ending up fourth in the session.|$|E
5|$|Nos. 607 and 609 Squadrons {{engaged the}} Germans {{south-west}} of The Needles. The British reported 30–40 Bf 110s with 15 Do 17s in support. The tonnage of bombs dropped suggested {{there were fewer}} bombers than claimed. The RAF fighters claimed four Do 17s. The fact remains that the Germans penetrated the airspace without interception and {{came very close to}} inflicting critical damage to the Spitfire factory. The radar had done its job and alerted No. 11 and 10 Group 20 minutes before the bombs <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall.</b> The fault lay either with the No. 10 or 11 Group controllers who were late in ordering their Squadrons to scramble.|$|E

5|$|The events {{started on}} 30 August 1942 after the Japanese recaptured four POWs {{escaped from the}} Selarang Barracks camps, and {{required}} that the other prisoners sign a pledge not to escape. After they refused, {{they were forced to}} crowd in the areas around the barracks square for nearly five days with little water and no sanitation. The executions of the recaptured POWs failed to break the men. The commanders, however, finally capitulated on 5 September when their men <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> ill and die from dysentery. Upon signing the pledge, the men were allowed to return to the barracks buildings.|$|E
5|$|After a bloodless {{skirmish}} between Serb {{insurgents and}} Croatian special police in March, the JNA itself, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the federal Presidency to grant it wartime powers and declare {{a state of}} emergency. The request was denied on 15 March 1991, and the JNA came {{under the control of}} Serbian President Slobodan Milošević in the summer of 1991 as the Yugoslav federation <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> apart. By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated, resulting in the first fatalities of the war. The JNA then stepped in to support the insurgents and prevent Croatian police from intervening. In early April, leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia announced their intention to integrate the areas under their control with Serbia. The Government of Croatia considered this an act of secession.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for {{the race}} were overshadowed by {{speculation}} over IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard's job, after he tweeted that some team owners {{were trying to get}} him fired. Dixon claimed pole position {{for the race}}, the first IndyCar event in Detroit since 2008, and maintained his lead throughout the race. After 38 laps, James Hinchcliffe hit a dislodged piece of the track and continued straight into the tire wall. Further investigation discovered that the track was disintegrating in various places, and the event was red flagged. After a two-hour break, in which track officials ripped out the damaged sections of track and filled the holes with concrete, the race was restarted, shortened to 60 laps. Rain also <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> lightly, and shortly after the restart a caution was issued when Hélio Castroneves spun. Dario Franchitti gained four places after the red flag, benefiting from his softer red tires, to finish second behind his teammate.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of inner London (then the County of London) {{had been in}} decline as more residents moved into the outer suburbs since its creation in 1889, and this continued after the Second World War. In contrast, the {{population of}} Middlesex had increased steadily during that period. From 1951 to 1961 {{the population of the}} inner districts of the county <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall,</b> and the population grew only in eight of the suburban outer districts. According to the 1961 census, Ealing, Enfield, Harrow, Hendon, Heston & Isleworth, Tottenham, Wembley, Willesden and Twickenham had each reached a population greater than 100,000, which would normally have entitled each of them to seek county borough status. If this status were to be granted to all those boroughs it would mean that the population of the administrative county of Middlesex would be reduced by over half, to just under one million.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} the electoral {{defeat of the}} government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions increased. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana - TO) to minimize potential resistance. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina regions and eastern Croatia. In January 1991, Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, made two unsuccessful attempts to obtain approval from the Yugoslav Presidency to deploy the JNA to disarm Croatian security forces. After a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March, the JNA, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the federal Presidency to grant it wartime powers and declare a state of emergency. The request was denied on 15 March, and by the summer of 1991, the JNA came {{under the control of the}} Serbian President Slobodan Milošević as the Yugoslav federation <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> apart.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December, at {{approximately}} 07:00, the independent HV armoured-mechanised unit advanced northwest along the Kupa, towards Gračanica. During the advance, {{one of the}} tanks was captured and its crew killed after the capture. Nearly simultaneously, the JNA commenced a tank and mortar attack against Stankovac and the river crossing at Šišinec. The HV armoured-mechanised unit and the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Brigade panicked, believing the crossing point was lost, and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> back to Šišinec in disarray, sustaining considerable casualties. Since {{there was no way}} to transport the remaining HV armour across the Kupa River, the tanks were destroyed by one of the force's own tanks. That tank was then destroyed with explosives to prevent its capture. As there were too few boats at the river crossing to allow a quick retreat, some of the troops swam across the river, causing several to drown in very cold water. The command post of the brigade fell back to Galdovo, while the troops started to retreat to Zagreb. The entire brigade was back in Zagreb by 15 December.|$|E

5|$|Another virtual safety car period ensued on lap 34, {{caused by}} Verstappen who crashed his {{car into the}} barrier after locking up his tyres. As the VSC ended on lap 37, Ricciardo once more failed {{in an attempt to}} regain the lead. At the chicane coming out of the tunnel, Hamilton misjudged the corner and backed Ricciardo off at the exit of the chicane, causing the latter to {{complain}} about the move on team radio. While the incident was investigated by the stewards, the decision was not to take action against Hamilton. At that point, the order stood as follows: Hamilton, Ricciardo, Pérez, Vettel, Alonso, Rosberg, Hülkenberg, Sainz, Button and Gutiérrez. The top four drivers pulled away cleanly {{from the rest of the}} field behind them. On lap 50, the two Sauber cars collided at Rascasse corner, after Felipe Nasr had ignored instructions from the pit lane to let his teammate Ericsson behind him pass. Another VSC period was called while both Sauber drivers made pit stops to repair damages, only for both to retire some laps later. In front, the race carried on in the same order. On lap 68, the fourth virtual safety car period occurred when a large plastic sheet fell onto the start–finish straight. Hamilton was able to extend his lead over Ricciardo at that point, setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 71. Three laps from the finish, rain <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> again, although no driver changed tyres before the chequered flag fell. Hamilton crossed the finish line to take victory ahead of Ricciardo and Pérez. This win for Hamilton marked his second at Monaco, the other being in 2008. These two races featured many similarities, such as the Hamilton starting third on the grid, the race starting in wet conditions and finishing in the dry, as well as Hamilton taking the lead on lap 33. Vettel hung on to fourth, followed by Alonso in fifth. Rosberg however lost his sixth place to Nico Hülkenberg on the very last lap.|$|E
5|$|Ibrox Park had {{the worst}} fan safety record in Britain before its {{complete}} redesign and renaming in 1997. Two fans died in September 1961 when a barrier collapsed on Stairway 13, resulting in a crush. Stairway 13 was a popular, often overcrowded, and very steep exit from the East Terracing due to its proximity to Copland Road subway station and parking areas for the Rangers supporters' coaches. After this incident, Rangers installed safety measures, but further injuries were sustained in crushes on Stairway 13 in both 1967 and 1969. On 23 October 1968, the main stand at Ibrox was hit by fire. Just seven months later there was another fire, which destroyed more than 200 seats behind the directors box. The worst disaster to yet affect football in Britain happened on Stairway 13 after the Old Firm game on 2 January 1971, when 66 people died of asphyxiation due to another crush on Stairway 13. The game itself ended in a 1–1 draw, with Colin Stein scoring a late equalising goal for Rangers. This led to a widespread belief that the crush had been caused by fans who had left the game early, but had turned back {{when they heard the}} roar that greeted the Rangers goal. A public inquiry discounted this initial story. It established that the crowd had been travelling in the same direction when the crush happened, with it perhaps being precipitated by some bending over to pick up items that had been discarded during the goal celebrations. The downward force of the crowd leaving the stadium meant that when people <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> there was no means of preventing a crush.|$|E
5|$|Saladin's brother Al-Adil {{rebuilt the}} citadel {{completely}} between 1203 and 1216 {{in response to}} the development of the counterweight trebuchet. After his death, power struggles broke out between the other Ayyubid princes and although Damascus switched hands several times, the citadel was taken by force only once, in 1239. The citadel remained in Ayyubid hands until the Mongols under their general Kitbuqa captured Damascus in 1260, thereby ending Ayyubid rule in Syria. After an unsuccessful revolt broke out in the citadel, the Mongols had most of it dismantled. After the defeat of the Mongols in 1260 by the Mamluks, who had succeeded the Ayyubids as rulers of Egypt, Damascus came under Mamluk rule. Except for brief periods in 1300 and 1401, when the Mongols conquered Damascus, the Mamluks controlled the citadel until 1516. In that year, Syria fell into the hands of the Ottoman Empire. Damascus surrendered without a fight and from the 17th century onward the citadel functioned as barracks for the Jannisaries—Ottoman infantry units. The citadel <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> into disrepair in the 19th century and its last military use was in 1925, when French soldiers shelled the old city from the citadel {{in response to the}} Great Syrian Revolt against the French Mandate of Syria. The citadel continued to serve as a barracks and prison until 1986, when excavations and restorations started. As of 2011, excavation and restoration efforts are still ongoing.|$|E
