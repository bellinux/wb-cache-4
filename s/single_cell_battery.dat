40|$|The zinc/bromine {{battery is}} a flowing {{electrolyte}} battery operating at ambient temperatures, and having both stationary and mobile applications. It {{is characterized by}} a flat voltage discharge profile, can be deeply discharged without adverse effects, and is made from low cost materials which can be recycled {{at the end of the}} battery's life. The electrochemically active materials are stored externally to the electrode assembly in two reservoirs, and are pumped to the electrodes during operation. The electrolyte typically includes aqueous zinc bromide and quaternary ammonium salts, such as methyl ethyl pyrrolidinium bromide (MEPBr) and methyl ethyl morpholinium bromide (MEMBr) which complex bromine and reduce self-discharge losses. Modification of the low temperature behaviour of the usual electrolyte, which freezes between - 5 and 5 ∘C, is required if the battery is to perform successfully at low temperatures. This project identified electrochemical and physical chemical techniques to study zinc deposition and bromine production at glassy carbon electrodes as a method to gain quantitative and qualitative information from the electrolyte system. Electrochemical response, chemical species distribution, conductivity and phase change data were obtained for battery electrolytes at low temperatures and used to identify candidate electrolytes for low temperature applications. The effect of the quaternary ammonium bromide salt on zinc species distribution and zinc deposition has not previously been studied. Spectroscopic and electrochemical studies indicated that the distribution of zinc/bromine complexes in solutions, and zinc deposition at glassy carbon were unaffected by the addition of quaternary ammonium bromides. The distribution of zinc/bromine complexes was significantly affected by temperature and state-of-charge or concentration of the electrolyte. Several organic compounds, including propan- 2 -ol, ethylene dichloride, propylene glycol and ethylene glycol, were evaluated as additives to the aqueous electrolyte for low temperature applications using techniques of cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, conductivity, and freezing point determination. Ethylene glycol was also selected on the basis of electrochemical and physical chemical data, to be tested in the <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>battery.</b> Due to reduced conductivity of the electrolyte (higher solution resistance in the battery), the voltaic and energy efficiencies were expected to be lower than those of a standard electrolyte battery.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), in {{addition}} to enabling monitoring solutions for numerous new applications areas, have gained huge popularity as a cost-effective, dynamically scalable, easy to deploy and maintainable alternatives to conventional infrastructure-based monitoring solutions. A WSN consists of spatially distributed autonomous wireless sensor nodes that measure desired physical phenomena and operate in a collaborative manner to relay the acquired information wirelessly to a central location. A wireless sensor node, integrating the required resources to enable infrastructure-less distributed monitoring, is constrained by its size, cost and energy. In order to address these constraints, a typical wireless sensor node is designed based on low-power and low-cost modules that in turn provide limited communication and processing performances. Data and computation intensive wireless monitoring applications, on the other hand, not only demand higher communication bandwidth and computational performance but also require practically feasible operational lifetimes so as to reduce the maintenance cost associated with the replacement of batteries. In relation to the communication and processing requirements of such applications and the constraints associated with a typical wireless sensor node, this thesis explores energy efficient wireless sensor node architecture that enables realization of data and computation intensive applications. Architectures enabling raw data transmission and in-sensor processing with various technological alternatives are explored. The potential architectural alternatives are evaluated both analytically and quantitatively with regards to different design parameters, in particular, the performance and the energy consumption. For quantitative evaluation purposes, the experiments are conducted on vibration and image-based industrial condition monitoring applications that are not only data and computation intensive but also are of practical importance. Regarding the choice of an appropriate wireless technology in an architecture enabling raw data transmission, standard based communication technologies including infrared, mobile broadband, WiMax, LAN, Bluetooth, and ZigBee are investigated. With regards to in-sensor processing, different architectures comprising of sequential processors and FPGAs are realized to evaluate different design parameters, especially the performance and energy efficiency. Afterwards, the architectures enabling raw data transmission only and those involving in-sensor processing are evaluated so as to find an energy efficient solution. The results of this investigation show that in-sensor processing architecture, comprising of an FPGA for computation purposes, is more energy efficient when compared with other alternatives {{in relation to the}} data and computation intensive applications. Based on the results obtained and the experiences learned in the architectural evaluation study, an FPGA-based high-performance wireless sensor platform, the SENTIOF, is designed and developed. In addition to performance, the SETNIOF is designed to enable dynamic optimization of energy consumption. This includes enabling integrated modules to be completely switched-off and providing a fast configuration support to the FPGA.  In order to validate the results of the evaluation studies, and to assess the performance and energy consumption of real implementations, both the vibration and image-based industrial monitoring applications are realized using the SENTIOF. In terms of computational performance for both of these applications, the real-time processing goals are achieved. For example, in the case of vibration-based monitoring, real-time processing performance for tri-axes (horizontal, vertical and axial) vibration data are achieved for sampling rates of more than 100 kHz. With regards to energy consumption, based on the measured power consumption that also includes the power consumed during the FPGA’s configuration process, the operational lifetimes are estimated using a <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>battery</b> (similar to an AA battery in terms of shape and size) with a typical capacity of 2600 mA. In the case of vibration-based condition monitoring, an operational lifetime of more than two years can be achieved for duty-cycle interval of 10 minutes or more. The achievable operational lifetime of image-based monitoring is more than 3 years for a duty-cycle interval of 5 minutes or more. ...|$|E

The main technical objective is the development of a <b>single</b> <b>cells</b> <b>battery</b> operated fully integrated CMOS RF transceiver that fulfills the main common requirements of low bit rate (typically a few 20 kbits/s) distributed wireless remote sensing Microsystems. The radio link should be bi-directional (half-duplex), work on small distances (maximum 100 m) and operate in the 434 MHz ISM band. The single chip transceiver is designed for specific applications such as home automation systems, security and surveillance systems, remote medical care and monitoring, computer interactive interfaces and robotics. In order to reduce power consumption, avoid DC-DC converters and be ready for next-generation deep-submicron processes with limited supply voltage, single battery operation is desirable. Therefore, ultimately, the circuits should be able to operate with a supply as low as 1 V, corresponding to the end-of-life battery voltage. Flicker noise rejection, power consumption due to the dynamic range or due to the high frequency, low voltage and low current density constraints are the main theoretical aspects discussed in this thesis. The integrated blocks are the low noise amplifier, the mixers, the power amplifier, the modulation and demodulation path. A direct conversion architecture is chosen in order to minimize the number of external components, allow for a reduced quadrature accuracy of the LO signal as well as to optimize the power consumption. A test chip containing the complete transceiver is designed and integrated in a 0. 5 µm standard digital CMOS process.

The lithium-ion battery is a preferred candidate as a source of power for the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and electric vehicle (EV) because of high energy density, high voltage, low self-discharge rate and good stability. HEV and EV applications require very large lithium-ion batteries, but, during high power extraction required to drive a vehicle, these large batteries may experience a significant temperature increase — which can lead to safety concerns. A properly designed thermal management system is crucial to prevent overheating and uneven heating across a large battery pack, which can lead to degradation, mismatch in cell capacity and thermal runaway. Design of the thermal management system requires knowledge of the cooling system as well as the amount of heat that will be generated by <b>cells</b> within the <b>battery</b> pack.

Further, the homogenized EBM model is confirmed to agree reasonably well with the detailed battery module (DBM) model for different packing modes with a length scale of up to 15 × 15 cells and 12 % deformation where the short circuit takes place. The suggested homogenized model for battery module makes way for battery module and pack safety evaluation for full-size electric vehicle crashworthiness analysis...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} miniature biosignal data sensor and recorder {{device is}} described, (NAT- 1 - 4 G) with 3 -axis accelerometer, and a 500 Sa/sec all-channel recording capacity of 36 {{hours or more}} with a <b>single</b> zinc-air <b>battery</b> <b>cell,</b> and up to 6 days at 100 Sa/Sec for accelerometer only. Like the previous NAT- 1 prototype device, this measures less than 18 ´ 22 ´ 10 mm and weighs less than 2. 3 grams, including the battery. In this paper we describe the device in detail, and introduce the presentation of tremor data measurement captured {{in the context of}} Parkinson’s disease fore-arm monitoring. The NAT- 1 - 4 G device itself has already achieved translation to commercialization and is currently available...|$|R
