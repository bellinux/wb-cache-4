40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effects of {{agglomeration}} economies on the productivity <b>of</b> manufacturing <b>local</b> <b>units</b> in Ireland. Four types of agglomeration economies are considered in this study. These are internal economies of scale, localization economies, related variety and urbanization economies. This study makes a number of contributions to the literature. Firstly, this is the first study to conduct an investigation of the effects of agglomeration economies on the productivity <b>of</b> manufacturing <b>local</b> <b>units</b> operating in Ireland. Secondly, this study distinguishes between indigenous and foreign-owned <b>local</b> <b>units</b> which is important given the dual nature of the Irish economy (Krugman, 1997). Thirdly, in addition to considering the effects of agglomeration economies, this study examines the impact of spurious agglomeration on the productivity <b>of</b> foreign-owned <b>local</b> <b>units.</b> Using data from the Census <b>of</b> Industrial <b>Local</b> <b>Units</b> and a series of IV GMM estimators to control for endogeneity, the results of the analysis conducted in Chapter 6 reveal that there are differences in the effects of agglomeration economies on the productivity of indigenous and foreign-owned <b>local</b> <b>units.</b> In Chapter 7 the Census <b>of</b> Industrial <b>Local</b> <b>Units</b> is supplemented by additional data sources and more in-depth measures are generated to capture the features of each of the external agglomeration economies considered in this analysis. There is some evidence to suggest that the availability <b>of</b> <b>local</b> inputs has a negative and significant impact on productivity. The NACE based measures of related variety reveal that the availability <b>of</b> <b>local</b> inputs and knowledge spillovers for related sectors have a negative and significant impact on productivity. There is clear evidence to suggest that urbanization economies are important for increasing the productivity <b>of</b> indigenous <b>local</b> <b>units.</b> The findings reveal that a 1 % increase in population density in the NUTS 3 region leads to an increase in the productivity <b>of</b> indigenous <b>local</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> approximately 0. 07 % to 0. 08 %. The results also reveal that there is a significant difference in the effects of agglomeration economies on the productivity of low-tech and medium/high-tech indigenous <b>local</b> <b>units.</b> The more in-depth measures of agglomeration economies used in Chapter 7 are also used in Chapter 8. A series of IV GMM regressions are estimated in order to identify the impact of agglomeration economies and spurious agglomeration on the productivity <b>of</b> foreign-owned <b>local</b> <b>units</b> operating in Ireland. There is some evidence found to suggest that the availability of a pool of skilled labour has a positive and significant on productivity <b>of</b> foreign-owned <b>local</b> <b>units.</b> There is also evidence to suggest that localization knowledge spillovers have a negative impact on the productivity <b>of</b> foreign-owned <b>local</b> <b>units.</b> There is strong evidence to suggest that the availability <b>of</b> <b>local</b> inputs has a negative impact on the productivity. The negative impact is not confined to the NACE 4 -digit sector but also extends into related sectors as determined by Porter’s (2003) cluster classification. The cluster based skills measure of related variety has a positive and significant impact on the productivity <b>of</b> foreign-owned <b>local</b> <b>units.</b> Similar to Chapter 7, there is clear evidence to suggest that urbanization economies are important for increasing the productivity <b>of</b> foreign-owned <b>local</b> <b>units.</b> Both the summary measure and each of the more in-depth measures of agglomeration economies have a positive and significant impact on productivity. Spurious agglomeration has a positive and significant impact on the productivity <b>of</b> foreign-owned <b>local</b> <b>units.</b> The results indicate that the more foreign-owned <b>local</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> the same nationality in the country the greater the levels of productivity for the <b>local</b> <b>unit.</b> From a policy perspective, urbanization economies are clearly important for increasing the productivity of both indigenous and foreign-owned <b>local</b> <b>units.</b> Furthermore, the availability of a pool of skilled labour appears to be important for increasing the productivity <b>of</b> foreign-owned <b>local</b> <b>units.</b> Another policy implication that arises from these results relates to the differences observed between indigenous <b>local</b> <b>units</b> and foreign-owned <b>local</b> <b>units</b> and also between low-tech and medium/high-tech indigenous <b>local</b> <b>units.</b> These findings indicate that ‘one-size-fits-all’ type policies are not appropriate for increasing the productivity <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>units</b> operating in Ireland. Policies should be tailored to the needs of either indigenous or foreign-owned <b>local</b> <b>units</b> and also to specific sectors. This positive finding for own country spurious agglomeration is important from a policy perspective and is one that IDA Ireland should take on board...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine possible indicators that affect <b>local</b> <b>unit</b> credit risk and investigate their effect on default (credit risk) <b>of</b> <b>local</b> government <b>units</b> in Croatia. No system for the estimation <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>unit</b> credit risk has been established in Croatia so far causing many practical problems in <b>local</b> <b>unit</b> borrowing. Because <b>of</b> the specific nature of the operations <b>of</b> <b>local</b> government <b>units</b> and legislation that does not allow <b>local</b> government <b>units</b> to go into bankruptcy, conventional methods for estimating credit risk are not applicable, and the set of standard potential determinants of credit risk has to be expanded with new indicators. Thus in the paper, in addition to the usual determinants of credit risk, the hypothesis of the influence of political factors on <b>local</b> <b>unit</b> credit risk in Croatia is also tested out, with the use of a Tobit model. Results of econometric analysis show that credit risk <b>of</b> <b>local</b> government <b>units</b> in Croatia is affected by the political structure <b>of</b> <b>local</b> government, the proportion of income tax and surtax in operating revenue, the ratio of net operating balance, net financial liabilities and direct debt to operating revenue, as well as the ratio of debt repayment and cash, and direct debt and operating revenue...|$|R
40|$|No {{detailed}} analysis of the fiscal and economic inequalities <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>units</b> (at the municipality and city level) in Croatia has ever been published. The Government and the Finance Ministry have endeavoured by tax sharing, allocations of current grants and personal income tax refunds to palliate the differences in the fiscal capacities <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>units.</b> However, {{at the same time the}} fiscal capacities have not been properly calculated, because during the definition of the criteria for horizontal fiscal equalisation no care has been paid to the economic inequalities nor has there been proper establishment <b>of</b> the way <b>local</b> <b>units</b> belong to a special financing system. The paper, then, tests out the hypothesis that the existing Croatian model of horizontal fiscal equalisation is ineffective, for the Government and the Finance Ministry do not, with their poorly targeted financial instruments (personal income tax sharing, current grants and personal income tax refunds), manage to bring about palliation of the differences among the fiscal capacities <b>of</b> the <b>local</b> <b>units,</b> on the contrary, they tend to increase them. fiscal equalisation, tax sharing, personal income tax, personal income, tax refund, fiscal capacity, Croatia...|$|R

We apply a Gaussian random field model to represent each image pair as vertices in a weighted graph and the optimal configuration of the field is obtained by harmonic energy minimization. A symmetrical feature selection criterion is first introduced to select robust matches <b>of</b> <b>local</b> keypoints between two images. The Mallows distance is then adopted to combine multiple cues from <b>statistics</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> matches.

In fact, a similar result is proved for any minor-closed property of bounded degree graphs. The main motivation of the above result comes from theoretical computer-science. Using our main result we infer that for any minor-closed property P, there is a constant time algorithm for detecting if a graph is “far” from satisfying P. This, in particular, answers an open problem of Goldreich and Ron [STOC 1997] [20], who asked if such an algorithm exists when P is the graph property of being planar. The proof combines results from the theory of graph minors with results on convergent sequences of sparse graphs, which rely on martingale arguments...|$|R
