50|$|If {{an agent}} does not {{disclose}} {{to a third}} party that he is acting as agent, and concludes {{a contract with the}} third party {{as if he were the}} principal in the transaction, the third party may treat the contract as binding on the agent. The third party may <b>sue</b> <b>the</b> agent, as principal, on the contract; equally the agent may, as principal, <b>sue</b> <b>the</b> third party on the contract. When, however, the undisclosed principal discovers that the contract that he in fact authorised has been concluded, he may adopt it, and may consequently <b>sue</b> <b>the</b> third party on it. Equally, the third party, on discovering the undisclosed principal, may <b>sue</b> <b>the</b> principal on the contract. it follows that the third party has a choice or an election to <b>sue</b> either <b>the</b> agent or the undisclosed principal, when discovered; but having elected to sue one of them the third party is debarred from <b>suing</b> <b>the</b> other, even if he or she <b>sues</b> <b>the</b> agent before being aware that there is a principal.
