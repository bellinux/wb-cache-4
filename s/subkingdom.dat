5|$|It {{has been}} speculated that this {{agreement}} marked a victory for Penda, ceding to him Cirencester and the areas along the lower River Severn. These lands to the southwest of Mercia had apparently been taken by the West Saxons from the Britons in 577, and the territory eventually {{became part of the}} <b>subkingdom</b> of the Hwicce. Given Penda's role in the area at this time and his apparent success there, {{it has been argued that}} the <b>subkingdom</b> of the Hwicce was established by him; evidence to support this is lacking, although the <b>subkingdom</b> is known to have existed later in the century. Bassett ("In search of the origins of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms", page 67) is more cautious, noting the lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus, who {{classified}} most {{kinds of}} sessile animals {{as belonging to}} the order Zoophyta in the class Vermes, mistakenly identified the genus Spongia as plants in the order Algae. For a long time thereafter sponges were assigned to a separate <b>subkingdom,</b> Parazoa ("beside the animals"), separate from the Eumetazoa which formed {{the rest of the}} kingdom Animalia. They have been regarded as a paraphyletic phylum, from which the higher animals have evolved. Other research indicates Porifera is monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{into two}} kingdoms {{is most likely}} to date back to the sixth century; east Kent may have conquered west Kent and preserved the institutions of kingship as a <b>subkingdom.</b> This was a common pattern in Anglo-Saxon England, as the more powerful kingdoms absorbed their weaker neighbours. An unusual feature of the Kentish system was that only sons of kings appeared to be legitimate claimants to the throne, although this did not eliminate all strife over the succession.|$|E

50|$|The {{tradition}} of dividing patrimonies among brothers {{meant that the}} Frankish realm was ruled, nominally, as one polity subdivided into several regna (kingdoms or <b>subkingdoms).</b> The geography and number of <b>subkingdoms</b> varied over time, but the particular term Francia came generally to refer to just one regnum, that of Austrasia, centred on the Rhine and Meuse in northern Europe. Even so, sometimes the term was used as well to encompass Neustria north of the Loire and west of the Seine.|$|R
5|$|The fungus kingdom {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} diversity of taxa with varied ecologies, life cycle strategies, and morphologies ranging from unicellular aquatic chytrids to large mushrooms. However, {{little is known}} of the true biodiversity of Kingdom Fungi, which has been estimated at 2.2 million to 3.8 million species, of which only 120,000 have been described. Ever since the pioneering 18th and 19th century taxonomical works of Carl Linnaeus, Christian Hendrik Persoon, and Elias Magnus Fries, fungi have been classified according to their morphology (e.g., characteristics such as spore color or microscopic features) or physiology. Advances in molecular genetics have {{opened the way for}} DNA analysis to be incorporated into taxonomy, which has sometimes challenged the historical groupings based on morphology and other traits. Phylogenetic studies published in the last decade have helped reshape the classification within Kingdom Fungi, which is divided into one <b>subkingdom,</b> seven phyla, and ten subphyla.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nothing is}} known of any other claimants to the throne, {{it is likely that}} there were other {{surviving}} descendants of Cerdic (the supposed progenitor of all the kings of Wessex) who might have contended for the kingdom. Ecgberht died in 839, and his will, according to the account of it found in the will of his grandson, Alfred the Great, left land only to male members of his family, so that the estates should not be lost to the royal house through marriage. Ecgberht's wealth, acquired through conquest, was no doubt one reason for his ability to purchase the support of the southeastern church establishment; the thriftiness of his will indicates he understood the importance of personal wealth to a king. The kingship of Wessex had been frequently contested among different branches of the royal line, and it is a noteworthy achievement of Ecgberht's {{that he was able to}} ensure Æthelwulf's untroubled succession. In addition, Æthelwulf's experience of kingship, in the <b>subkingdom</b> formed from Ecgberht's southeastern conquests, would have been valuable to him when he took the throne.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} {{weaknesses}} of the see of York was its lack of suffragan bishops. Thurstan managed to secure {{the resurrection of the}} Diocese of Galloway, or Whithorn, in 1125. It is possible that he compromised with Fergus of Galloway, who was the lord or sub-king of Galloway, in what is now Scotland. In this Thurstan secured another suffragan, and Fergus gained a bishop in his lordship, where previously ecclesiastical matters in his <b>subkingdom</b> had been handled by Scottish bishops. The first bishop was the native Galwegian– Gilla Aldan. This provoked the wrath of Wimund, Bishop of the Isles, who had previously had jurisdiction over Galloway; but the new bishopric survived, and York had a new suffragan, an important step in the battle between York and Canterbury over the primacy, which was mainly a battle over the prestige of their respective sees. The number of bishops subject to either archbishop was an important factor in the reputation of each. In 1133, Thurstan, who had received papal permission to found an entirely new diocese, consecrated Æthelwold as the first bishop of the new see of Carlisle.|$|E
50|$|The Paleotropical Kingdom (Paleotropis) is a floristic kingdom {{comprising}} tropical {{areas of}} Africa, Asia and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), {{as proposed by}} Ronald Good and Armen Takhtajan. Part of its flora, inherited from the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana or exchanged later (e.g. Piperaceae with pantropical distribution and but few warm temperate representatives), is shared with the Neotropical Kingdom, comprising tropical areas of Central and South America. Moreover, the Paleotropical flora influenced the tropical flora of the Australian Kingdom. The Paleotropical Kingdom is subdivided into five floristic <b>subkingdoms</b> according to Takhtajan (or three, according to Good) and about 13 floristic regions. In this article the floristic <b>subkingdoms</b> and regions are given as delineated by Takhtajan.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, Cavalier-Smith {{divided the}} kingdom Protozoa into two <b>subkingdoms</b> and 18 phyla. By 2003 he used phylogenic {{evidence}} {{to revise the}} total number of proposed phyla down to 11: Amoebozoa, Choanozoa, Cercozoa, Retaria, Loukozoa, Metamonada, Euglenozoa, Percolozoa, Apusozoa, Alveolata, Ciliophora, and Miozoa.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{development}} from two kingdoms to five among most scientists, some authors {{as late as}} 1975 continued to employ a traditional two-kingdom system of animals and plants, dividing the plant kingdom into <b>Subkingdoms</b> Prokaryota (bacteria and cyanophytes), Mycota (fungi and supposed relatives), and Chlorota (algae and land plants).|$|R
25|$|According to the 11th century hagiography, Vita Sancti Rumwoldi, {{he was the}} {{grandson}} of Penda of Mercia (a pagan, but incorrectly described in Rumwold's hagiography as having converted to Christianity) {{and the son of}} a king of Northumbria. His parents are not actually named; Alhfrith, son of Oswiu of Northumbria, did marry a daughter of Penda, Cyneburh, but Alhfrith was never king of Northumbria himself, although his father was (Alhfrith did rule the <b>subkingdom</b> of Deira for a time). There have, however, been doubts about whether these were his parents: for instance, the Northumbrian king is described as a pagan, but Alhfrith was a Christian (at least according to Bede, who says Alhfrith convinced Penda's son Peada to convert to Christianity). Although it has been stated that Cyneburh is not known to have had any children, Northumbrian genealogy states she and Alhfrith had a further son, Osric, who subsequently became King of Northumbria himself (source: Stenton).|$|E
500|$|Thomas Cavalier-Smith, who has {{published}} {{extensively on the}} classification of protists, has recently proposed that the Neomura, the clade that groups together the Archaea and Eucarya, would have evolved from Bacteria, more precisely from Actinobacteria. His 2004 classification treated the archaeobacteria {{as part of a}} <b>subkingdom</b> of the Kingdom Bacteria, i.e. he rejected the three-domain system entirely. Stefan Luketa in 2012 proposed a five [...] "dominion" [...] system, adding Prionobiota (acellular and without nucleic acid) and Virusobiota (acellular but with nucleic acid) to the traditional three domains.|$|E
500|$|The 2007 {{classification}} of Kingdom Fungi {{is the result}} of a large-scale collaborative research effort involving dozens of mycologists and other scientists working on fungal taxonomy. It recognizes seven phyla, two of which—the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota—are contained within a branch representing <b>subkingdom</b> Dikarya, the most species rich and familiar group, including all the mushrooms, most food-spoilage molds, most plant pathogenic fungi, and the beer, wine, and bread yeasts. The accompanying cladogram depicts the major fungal taxa and their relationship to opisthokont and unikont organisms, based on the work of Philippe Silar and [...] "The Mycota: A Comprehensive Treatise on Fungi as Experimental Systems for Basic and Applied Research". The lengths of the branches are not proportional to evolutionary distances.|$|E
50|$|Prior to independence, Simpang Empat {{was ruled}} by the Karo king Sibayak of Lingga, whose domain {{consisted}} of the <b>subkingdoms</b> of Sitelu (ruled by a king of marga Karo-Karo), Tigapancur (ruled by a king of marga Sembiring Gurukinayan), and Siempat Teran ({{ruled by the}} king of marga Karo-Karo Sitepu). The district is called Simpang Empat because the government building was constructed at the intersection (Simpang) where the three kings once met.|$|R
5|$|The two kingdoms within Kent were {{east and}} west Kent. Western Kent has fewer archaeological finds from the {{earliest}} periods than east Kent, and the eastern finds are somewhat distinct in character, showing Jutish and Frankish influence. The archaeological evidence, combined with the known political division into two kingdoms, makes it likely that {{the origin of the}} <b>subkingdoms</b> was the conquest of the western half by the eastern, which would have been the first area settled by the invaders.|$|R
5000|$|Glywysing {{is said to}} {{be named}} after Glywys, a real or legendary early monarch, whose name may {{continue}} that of the Romano-British *Glevenses, the territory and citizens of Glevum (modern Gloucester). [...] According to 12th-century sources, after the death of Glywys, the kingdom was divided into seven cantrefs named for his sons: Cydweli, Gwyr, Margam, Penychen, Gwynllwg, Gorfynydd, and another. These were typically ruled together by the head of the family and sometimes treated as appenage <b>subkingdoms.</b>|$|R
500|$|Coenwulf's kin {{may have}} been {{connected}} to the royal family of the Hwicce, a <b>subkingdom</b> of Mercia around the lower river Severn. It appears that Coenwulf's family were powerful, {{but they were not}} of recent Mercian royal lineage. A letter written by Alcuin to the people of Kent in 797 laments that [...] "scarcely anyone is found now of the old stock of kings". Eardwulf of Northumbria had, like Coenwulf, gained his throne in 796, so Alcuin's meaning is not clear, but it may be that he intended it as a slur on Eardwulf or Coenwulf or on both. Alcuin certainly held negative views of Coenwulf, regarding him as a tyrant and criticizing him for putting aside one wife and taking another. Alcuin wrote to a Mercian nobleman to ask him to greet Coenwulf peaceably [...] "if it is possible to do so", implying uncertainty about Coenwulf's policy towards the Carolingians.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the loss}} of dominance, Ecgberht's {{military}} successes fundamentally changed the political landscape of Anglo-Saxon England. Wessex retained control of the south-eastern kingdoms, {{with the possible exception}} of Essex, and Mercia did not regain control of East Anglia. Ecgberht's victories marked the end of the independent existence of the kingdoms of Kent and Sussex. The conquered territories were administered as a <b>subkingdom</b> for a while, including Surrey and possibly Essex. Although Æthelwulf was a subking under Ecgberht, it is clear that he maintained his own royal household, with which he travelled around his kingdom. Charters issued in Kent described Ecgberht and Æthelwulf as [...] "kings of the West Saxons and also of the people of Kent." [...] When Æthelwulf died in 858 his will, in which Wessex is left to one son and the southeastern kingdom to another, makes it clear that it was not until after 858 that the kingdoms were fully integrated. Mercia remained a threat, however; Ecgberht's son Æthelwulf, established as king of Kent, gave estates to Christ Church, Canterbury, probably to counter any influence the Mercians might still have there.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, Cavalier-Smith {{classified}} Myxozoa as a protozoan parvkingdom. By 1998, he had reclassified it as {{an animal}} <b>subkingdom.</b> Myxozoa contains three phyla, Myxosporidia, Haplosporidia, and Paramyxia, which were reclassified as animals along with Myxozoa. Likewise, Cavalier-Smith reclassified the protozoan phylum Mesozoa as an animal <b>subkingdom.</b>|$|E
50|$|Botanist Ronald Good (1947) {{identified}} six floristic kingdoms (Boreal or Holarctic, Neotropical, Paleotropical, South African, Australian, and Antarctic), {{the largest}} natural units he determined for flowering plants. Good's six kingdoms are subdivided into smaller units, called provinces. The Paleotropical kingdom {{is divided into}} three <b>subkingdoms,</b> which are each subdivided into floristic provinces. Each of the other five kingdoms are subdivided directly into provinces. There are a total of 37 floristic provinces. Almost all provinces are further subdivided into floristic regions.|$|R
50|$|The fraternal kings {{showed only}} {{intermittent}} signs {{of friendship and}} were often in rivalry. On the early death of Chlodomer, his brother Chlothar had his young sons murdered {{in order to take}} a share of his kingdom, which was, in accordance with custom, divided between the surviving brothers. Theuderic died in 534, but his adult son Theudebert I was capable of defending his inheritance, which formed the largest of the Frankish <b>subkingdoms</b> and the kernel of the later kingdom of Austrasia.|$|R
25|$|Upon his father's {{death in}} 876, Louis fully {{inherited}} his <b>subkingdoms,</b> bearing the title rex Francorum ("king of the Franks"). Louis the Younger considered himself the true heir of Louis the German {{and as his}} father died in 876, Louis buried him in the abbey of Lorsch, in his own territories, in order to emphasise his primacy to his brothers. Louis also retained his father's chief advisor, Luitbert, Archbishop of Mainz. He and his brother ruled their kingdoms independently but cooperatively and never at war.|$|R

The Franks launched a series of attacks on various Breton fortresses and, after Morman was killed in battle, resistance collapsed.

25|$|Clovis I divided his realm {{between his}} four sons, who united to defeat Burgundy in 534.

5|$|The {{surviving}} regnal lists {{show only}} one king reigning {{at a time}} in Kent, but <b>subkingdoms</b> were common among the Anglo-Saxons and from the reign of Hlothhere, in the late seventh century, there is evidence that Kent was usually ruled by two kings, though often one is clearly dominant. It is less clear that this is the case before Hlothhere. Forged charters preserve a tradition of Eadbald ruling during his father's reign, presumably as a subking over west Kent. The papal letter that has been interpreted as indicating the existence of Æthelwald, a brother of Eadbald's, refers to Æthelwald as a king; if he existed, he would presumably have been a junior king to Eadbald.|$|R
