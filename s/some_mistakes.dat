5|$|The Disposals Commission's {{activities}} peaked during 1946 and 1947. Sales generally went {{smoothly and}} {{in accordance with}} the principles set by the Government and did not significantly disrupt normal commerce. While the Commission generally operated efficiently, <b>some</b> <b>mistakes</b> occurred such as clothing and scrap metal being sold well beneath their market value. The volume of sales dropped rapidly after 1947 and the Disposals Commission was disbanded in July 1949. By this time the commission had sold £135,189,000 worth of equipment.|$|E
5|$|Space Shuttle Discovery docked on 10 March 2001, {{bringing}} to the ISS the new long-duration three-person crew of Expedition 2, as well as four short-term crew members of STS-102. A few hours after docking, the hatch opened, and all ten astronauts greeted each other, setting a new record for the number people simultaneously in the ISS. The day after docking, American astronauts Jim Voss and Susan Helms began a spacewalk which ended up being nearly nine hours long, and still holds {{the record for the}} longest spacewalk ever performed, as of August 2010. The length of the spacewalk was partially due to <b>some</b> <b>mistakes,</b> including Voss accidentally releasing a small tool. Unable to retrieve it, NASA engineers tracked the tool, and decided to use Discoverys thrusters on 14 March to boost the station four kilometers higher, to ensure the ISS would not collide with the piece of space debris.|$|E

Ögedei was an extremely pragmatic man, though he made <b>some</b> <b>mistakes</b> during his reign.

25|$|The work of Lorentz was mathematically perfected by Henri Poincaré who {{formulated}} on {{many occasions}} the Principle of Relativity and tried to harmonize it with electrodynamics. He declared simultaneity only a convenient convention which depends on the speed of light, whereby the constancy {{of the speed of}} light would be a useful postulate for making the laws of nature as simple as possible. In 1900 and 1904 he physically interpreted Lorentz's local time as the result of clock synchronization by light signals. And finally in June and July 1905 he declared the relativity principle a general law of nature, including gravitation. He corrected <b>some</b> <b>mistakes</b> of Lorentz and proved the Lorentz covariance of the electromagnetic equations. However, he used the notion of an aether as a perfectly undetectable medium and distinguished between apparent and real time, so most historians of science argue that he failed to invent special relativity.|$|E

Brian Baumgartner felt that the show [...] "stayed status quo , but without a key piece" [...] and [...] "didn't make a firm decision" [...] on the direction it was headed. Ben Silverman, one of the show's producers, said that [...] "it didn't have the sense of purpose and focus" [...] that the next season would have.|$|E

[...] Under pressure from black leaders, McKinley required the War Department to commission black officers above the rank of lieutenant. [...] McKinley toured the South in late 1898, promoting sectional reconciliation. He visited Tuskegee Institute and black educator Booker T. Washington. He also visited Confederate memorials. In his tour of the South, McKinley {{did not mention the}} racial tensions or violence. Although the President received a rapturous reception from Southern whites, many African Americans, excluded from official welcoming committees, felt alienated by the President's words and actions. [...] Gould concluded regarding race, [...] "McKinley lacked the vision to transcend the biases of his day and to point toward a better future for all Americans".|$|E
