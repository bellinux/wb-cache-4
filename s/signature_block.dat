40|$|Two {{efficient}} authenticated encryption schemes with message linkages are proposed. One {{is a basic}} scheme, that it has {{the better}} performance {{in comparison with the}} all previously proposed schemes in terms of the communication and the computation costs. However, it has a property as same as the previously proposed schemes, that the message blocks can be recovered only after the entire <b>signature</b> <b>blocks</b> have been received. Therefore, the basic scheme is applicable to encrypt all-or-nothing flow. Thus, we improve the basic scheme and also propose a generalized scheme, which allows the receiver to recover the partial message blocks before receiving the entire <b>signature</b> <b>blocks,</b> That is, the receiver may perform the receiving and the recovering processes simultaneously. Therefore, the generalized scheme is applicable to message flows. The generalized scheme requires smaller bandwidth and computational time as compared to the previously proposed authenticated encryption schemes with message linkages for message flows.

5000|$|In {{e-mail and}} {{newsgroup}} usage, {{another type of}} signature exists which is independent of one's language. Users can set one or more lines of custom text known as a <b>signature</b> <b>block</b> to be automatically appended to their messages. This text usually includes a name, contact information, and sometimes quotations and ASCII art. A shortened form of a <b>signature</b> <b>block,</b> only including one's name, often with some distinguishing prefix, {{can be used to}} simply indicate the end of a post or response. Some web sites also allow graphics to be used. Note, however, that this type of signature is not related to electronic signatures or digital signatures, which are more technical in nature and not directly understandable by humans.

Some posters delete only parts dealing with issues that they see as &ldquo;closed,&rdquo; and leave any parts that, in their opinion, deserve further discussion or will be replied to in a later message.|$|R
40|$|Most of today's {{computers}} {{are connected to}} the Internet or at least to a local network, exposing system vulnerabilities to the potential attackers. One of the attackers' goals is the execution of the unauthorized code. In this paper we propose a framework that will allow execution of the trusted code only and prevent malicious code from executing. The proposed framework relies on the runtime verification of basic <b>block</b> <b>signatures.</b> The basic <b>block</b> <b>signatures</b> are generated during a trusted installation process, using a signature function with secret coefficients and the address of the basic block within a program. The result of the trusted installation is the encrypted basic <b>block</b> <b>signature</b> table (BBST), which is appended to the program binary. The potential of the proposed framework is evaluated using traces of SPEC CPU 2000 benchmarks. The results indicate that the proposed mechanism does not have a large negative impact on performance...|$|R

He was granted a medical hardship after missing the bulk of the 2008 season due to injury, thus he picked up an extra year of eligibility. Miller returned to the field in 2009, and started all 12 games, seven at right guard where he opened the season, and five at right tackle when the line was shuffled for assorted reasons. His teammates referred to him as 'look-out', made famous by his <b>signature</b> <b>blocking</b> technique.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Signature as a query is {{important}} for content-based document image retrieval from a scanned document repository. This paper presents a two-stage approach to-wards automatic signature segmentation and recognition from scanned document images. In the first stage, <b>signature</b> <b>blocks</b> are segmented from the document using word-wise component extraction and classification. Gradient based features are ex-tracted from each component at the word level to perform the classification task. In the 2 nd stage, SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) descriptors and Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) -based approaches are used for signature recognition. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are employed as the clas-sifier for both levels in this experiment.

50|$|Internet email {{messages}} {{consist of}} two major sections, the message header and the message body, collectively known as content. The header is structured into fields such as From, To, CC, Subject, Date, and other information about the email. In the process of transporting email messages between systems, SMTP communicates delivery parameters and information using message header fields. The body contains the message, as unstructured text, sometimes containing a <b>signature</b> <b>block</b> at the end. The header is separated from the body by a blank line.|$|E

40|$|Several fragile {{watermarking}} schemes {{presented in}} the literature are either vulnerable to vector quantization (VQ) counterfeiting attacks or sacrifice localization accuracy to improve security. Using a hierarchical structure, we propose a method that thwarts the VQ attack while sustaining the superior localization properties of blockwise independent watermarking methods. In particular, we propose dividing the image into blocks in a multi-level hierarchy and calculating <b>block</b> <b>signatures</b> in this hierarchy. While <b>signatures</b> of small <b>blocks</b> on {{the lowest level of}} the hierarchy ensure superior accuracy of tamper localization, higher level <b>block</b> <b>signatures</b> provide increasing resistance to VQ attacks. At the top level, a signature calculated using the whole image completely thwarts the counterfeiting attack. Moreover, "sliding window" searches through the hierarchy enable the verification of untampered regions after an image has been cropped. 1...|$|R
