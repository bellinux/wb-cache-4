25|$|A <b>standard</b> <b>illuminant</b> is a {{theoretical}} source of visible light with a profile (its spectral power distribution) which is published. Standard illuminants {{provide a basis}} for comparing images or colors recorded under different lighting.|$|E
25|$|To {{deal with}} the problem of having to compare light sources of {{different}} correlated color temperatures (CCT), the CIE settled on using a reference black body with the same color temperature for lamps with a CCT of under 5000K, or a phase of CIE <b>standard</b> <b>illuminant</b> D (daylight) otherwise. This presented a continuous range of color temperatures to choose a reference from. Any chromaticity difference between the source and reference illuminants were to be abridged with a von Kries-type chromatic adaptation transform.|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} a novel spectral LED-based tunable light source used for customized lighting solutions, {{especially for the}} reconstruction of CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage) <b>standard</b> <b>illuminants.</b> The light source comprises 31 spectral bands ranging from 400 to 700 nm, an integrating cube and a control board with a 16 -bit resolution. A minimization algorithm to calculate the weighting values for each channel was applied to reproduce illuminants with precision. The differences in spectral fitting and colorimetric parameters showed that the reconstructed spectra were comparable to the standard, especially for the D 65, D 50, A and E illuminants. Accurate results were also obtained for illuminants with narrow peaks such as fluorescents (F 2 and F 11) and a high-pressure sodium lamp (HP 1). In conclusion, the developed spectral LED-based light source and the minimization algorithm are able to reproduce any CIE <b>standard</b> <b>illuminants</b> with a high spectral and colorimetric accuracy able to advance available custom lighting systems useful in the industry and other fields such as museum lighting.

5000|$|The name D65 {{suggests}} that the correlated color temperature (CCT) should be 6500 K, while in truth it is closer to 6504 K.

This shifted the Planckian locus, affecting all CCTs, which are calculated by finding the nearest point on the locus to the white point.

Upon near ultraviolet `(n-UV) excitation, Dy 3 +/Eu 3 + co-doped phosphors exhibit the characteristics blue (F- 4 (9. 2) -> H- 6 (15 / 2)), yellow (F- 4 (9. 2) -> H- 6 (13 / 2)) and red (D- 5 (0) -> F- 7 (2)) emission corresponding to transitions of Dy 3 +and Eu 3 +ions. By changing the doping concentration of Dy 3 + and Eu 3 +, the emission hue could be controlled via the energy transfer mechanism. The energy transfer efficiency and critical distance of Dy 3 + and Eu 3 + have been calculated.

50|$|Alexis Spectral Data is a {{software}} developed for colour matching processes that calculates from available spectral data the colour numbers used by computers to display colours on screen. It displays the colour for each spectral reflectance curve and records the calculated trichromatic values and colour numbers {{along with the}} spectral curves. This eliminates the need to scan the samples separately with a Truecolour Scanner while creating the database. The spectral data can be introduced manually {{as a series of}} reflectance values at wavelengths measured in different <b>standard</b> <b>illuminants</b> with an arbitrary but fixed increment that must be kept for each spectral curve throughout the creation of the whole database. Therefore, older UV-VIS Spectrophotometers that can’t be interfaced with computers can also be used for creating the database needed for colour matching. Alexis Spectral Data determines the whiteness degree in a less time consuming method, which permits storage and easier handling of the obtained data.|$|R

The spectral power distribution (SPD) of CIE Standard Illuminat A is based on Planck's law, the relative spectral power distribution has been calculated using Plank's formula at every nanometer between 300 nm and 830 nm. Although the SPD could be calculated also at intermediate wavelength directly from Planck's formula, the standard states that for such wavelengths linear interpolation should be used. The difference between the linearly interpolated value and the exact SPD calculated from Planck's formula is at 300 nm of the order of 10 - 4, at longer wavelength it becomes even less significant.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an effective approach for the optimization of multiband spectra to produce prospective white-light spectra having specific color temperatures. The optimization process employs a genetic algorithm known as differential evolution, {{which aims to}} minimize the color rendering differences between a prospective white-light spectrum and its corresponding reference illuminant. Color rendering is assessed by calculating the CIEDE 2000 color difference (ΔE 00) for 14 CIE test colors under the two sources. Optimized white-light spectra were matched to three CIE <b>standard</b> <b>illuminants,</b> that is, A (2856 [*]K), D 50 (5003 [*]K), and D 65 (6504 [*]K). Optimal solutions for three- and four-band 25 and 50 [*]nm Gaussian spectra are presented and analyzed, together with mixed 4 -LED spectra that were optimized in the same way. In all cases, the simulated sources were shown to provide color rendering of such quality that ΔE 00 av ≤ 2. 24 units.
