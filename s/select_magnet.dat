5000|$|Crossbar {{switches}} use switching matrices {{made from}} a two-dimensional array of contacts arranged in an x-y format. These switching matrices are operated {{by a series of}} horizontal bars arranged over the contacts. Each such [...] "select" [...] bar can be rocked up or down by electromagnets to provide access to two levels of the matrix. A second set of vertical [...] "hold" [...] bars is set at right angles to the first (hence the name, [...] "crossbar") and also operated by electromagnets. The select bars carry spring-loaded wire fingers that enable the hold bars to operate the contacts beneath the bars. When the select and then the hold electromagnets operate in sequence to move the bars, they trap one of the spring fingers to close the contacts beneath the point where two bars cross. This then makes the connection through the switch as part of setting up a calling path through the exchange. Once connected, the <b>select</b> <b>magnet</b> is then released so it can use its other fingers for other connections, while the hold magnet remains energized {{for the duration of the}} call to maintain the connection. The crossbar switching interface was referred to as the TXK or TXC (telephone exchange crossbar) switch in the UK.|$|E

40|$|During the Large Hadron Collider {{operation}} in 2010 and 2011, {{it was observed}} that about 50 % of the main dipole magnets exhibiting two apertures showed unbalanced dynamic-impedance behavior not well understood. When a main dipole circuit is switched off, voltage waves with a frequency of 28 Hz travel along the chain of magnets. The difference in voltage drop across the two halves of the magnets can cause a spurious trigger of the quench detection system leading to undesired firing of quench heaters. In order to investigate this phenomenon, dedicated measurements of the impedance in the frequency range 1 - 20 kHz are performed on four <b>selected</b> <b>magnets</b> in the Large Hadron Collider tunnel. As expected, separate measurements of the frequency transfer function of the two apertures of certain magnets show a difference in the ac behavior of the apertures, particularly in the frequency range 10 - 200 Hz.

The measured frequency transfer functions are compared with results obtained using an equivalent electrical model developed with Wolfram Mathematica.

Three experimental halls are serviced by the accelerator through separate transport channels. The magnet powering system for CEBAF consists of approximately 2000 independent control channels. About 1850 of these channels are low current, trim magnet power supplies. There are 28 higher power supplies used to energize the major bending elements. Over one hundred, 20 amp, active shunts are used to vary current in <b>selected</b> <b>magnets</b> in the major dipole strings. The majority of the magnetic elements are concentrated in the arcs and transport channels. The correction dipoles, quadrupoles and sextupoles are each powered individually be a dedicated trim power supply channel. The arc and extraction channel dipoles are powered in series strings by the high powered supplies, known locally at CEBAF as `box power supplies'. Arc loads consist of some 30 [...] 40 magnets in series. Transport channel, path length control doglegs and septa box power supplies have loads ranging from 1 to 10 magnets. Shunts are installed on virtually all loads where two or more magnets are in series. At this time, 95 % of the power supplies are installed and commissioned.

(2) The relationship between the leadership style (transformational, transactional, or laissez-faire) of the school principal and the school 2 ̆ 7 s climate in <b>selected</b> elementary <b>magnet</b> and non-magnet schools in the Wake County Public School System. (3) The relationship between the leadership style (transformational, transactional, or laissez-faire) of the school principal and student achievement in <b>selected</b> elementary <b>magnet</b> and non-magnet schools in the Wake County Public School System. ^ The study was conducted with selected elementary schools in the Wake County Public School System. The sample population consisted of 600 teachers; 1999 North Carolina End-of-Grade Tests scores for 13, 266 students in grades three, four, and five; 20 elementary magnet schools; 20 elementary non-magnet schools; and 40 principals in schools categorized as elementary magnet and non-magnet. ^ Three instruments were used to gather data. The first instrument was the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire Form (5 X-Short) which was developed by Bass and Avolio (1995). This instrument served as the measure of principal leadership style (transformational, transactional, or laissez-faire). The second instrument that was used in this study is the NASSP School Climate Survey (NASSP, 1987). It served as the measure of school climate. The North Carolina 1999 End-of-Grade Tests percentage scores for reading and mathematics served as the instrument to measure student achievement. ^ Data for the study was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Descriptive statistical analyses (means and standard deviations) and One-Way Analysis of Variance were the statistical procedures used to test and describe the data for the six hypotheses. ^ The results of this study indicated that there was no significant difference between principals 2 ̆ 7 self ratings and teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings of transactional and laissez-faire leadership styles in magnet schools. There was a significant difference in principals 2 ̆ 7 self ratings and teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings of transformational leadership styles in magnet schools.

The atoms of choice are heated in an oven to create gas, which is collimated into a beam. This beam, consisting of a mixture of atoms in two states, passes through a state-selector magnet A, where atoms of the wrong state are separated out from the beam. The remaining beam is exposed to an RF field {{at or near the}} transition frequency. The beam then passes through a space containing a static homogeneous magnetic field before it is again exposed to the RF field. The RF field and the C-field coil will flip the state of the atoms, with a probability depending on how close the microwave frequency is to the atomic transition frequency. After the second RF field exposure the atomic beam passes through a second state selector magnet B, where the atoms that did not change state (are still in the state <b>selected</b> by <b>magnet</b> A) are discarded. This way, the number of atoms which survive magnet B is related to the microwaves' ability to match the atomic transition frequency. After the second state selector, a mass-spectrometer using an ionizer detects the rate of atoms being received.|$|R

These include giant magnetoresistive (GMR), current perpendicular to plane (CPP) spin valve and magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) thin films. The magneto-electronic films are utilized in disk drive read/write heads, magnetic sensors and MRAM devices. A magnetron delivers a field that enables fast and efficient deposition of permalloy and other materials onto silicone or ceramic substrates. During the deposition process of some magnetic materials, a permanent or an electromagnetic biasing assembly orients the film. After deposition, some films are pinned by annealing the wafer in a magnetic field to induce an easy axis of magnetization (Fig. 1).

The field distribution is calculated in the presence or absence of iron return yokes, The field values are obtained by using computer codes for *variable permeability problems based on vector potential calculations. Computational results are compared to simplified first-order calculation methods utilizing uniform permeability distribution or infinite permeability in iron. To show the extent of perturbations due to coil manufacturing upon field or gradient homogeneity in beam transport magnets, a calculating method based on complex variables is used. Field or gradient distribution in the coil aperture, due to ideal current density distribution, is compared to flux densities or field gradients when the ideal coil configuration has been modified to a more practical shape.

They do poorly when plated in a thin plasma clot, failing to multiply or to assume their characteristic shape; but they flourish when allowed to attach themselves to strands of lens paper bathed in serum that is frequently changed. Bacterial infection of serum cultures of Kupffer cells from normal rabbits and dogs occurs only {{as the result of}} secondary contamination of the materials, whereas it regularly develops in cultures from animals with fever induced by the injection of nucleic acid or of killed B. prodigiosus. Kupffer cells obtained under such conditions are abnormally active, and some can be washed out of the liver of sick animals {{in the absence of any}} preliminary phagocytosis of particulate matter. The facts have a bearing both on the conditions conducing to blood invasion and on the response of the Kupffer cells in the emergency. The characters of the isolated Kupffer cells and the results of tests of their presumptive functions will be described in later papers...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{demand for}} clear {{sequential}} aligner therapy {{has increased dramatically}} in recent years. An improved system utilising small neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnetic attachments has been proposed to enhance appliance capabilities. Aim: The aim of the investigation was to analyse the force system diagrams produced by small attracting NdFeB magnets to determine, 1) whether the force levels were sufficient to induce tooth movement, 2) the effect of magnet morphology on force characteristics and, 3) the most appropriate magnet dimensions that could be utilised for this application. Methods: Twenty-nine NdFeB rectangular magnets of varying dimensions were tested. A Mach- 1 universal testing machine (Biosyntech Inc, Quebec, Canada) {{was used to measure}} the attractive force of pairs of magnets. Measurements commenced with a magnetic pair in contact and subsequently vertically separated a distance of 10 mm at a speed of 12 mm/minute. For all magnetic configurations four repeat measurements were performed on five magnetic pairs of the same size. Results: The force-distance diagrams for all magnet configurations demonstrated a dramatic decrease in force with increasing magnet separation. Rather than a suggested inverse square law, the experimental data followed an inverse fourth law when an offset determined by a regression analysis was applied to the distance. For the majority of magnets, insignificant forces were attained beyond 2 mm of separation. Magnets with large pole face areas and longer magnetic axes provided the greatest force. Conclusions: A <b>select</b> range of <b>magnet</b> configurations exhibited suitable and reliable attractive forces and therefore could be advocated for prescribed clinical application. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} years, Tandem Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (TAMS) has become {{established}} {{as an important}} method for radionuclide analysis. In the Arizona system the accelerator is operated at a thermal voltage of 1. 8 MV for C- 14 analysis, and 1. 6 to 2 MV for Be- 10. Samples are inserted into a cesium sputter ion source in solid form. Negative ions sputtered from the target are accelerated to about 25 kV, and the injection <b>magnet</b> <b>selects</b> ions of a particular mass. Ions of the 3 + charge state, having an energy of about 9 MeV are selected by an electrostatic deflector, surviving ions pass through two magnets, where only ions of the desired mass-energy product are selected. The final detector is a combination ionization chamber to measure energy loss (and hence, Z), and a silicon surface-barrier detector which measures residual energy. After counting the trace iosotope for a fixed time, the injected ions are switched to the major isotope used for normalization. These ions are deflected into a Faraday cup after the first high-energy magnet. Repeated measurements of the isotope ratio of both sample and standards results in a measurement of the concentration of the radionuclide. Recent improvements in sample preparation for C- 14 make preparation of high-beam current graphite targets directly from CO 2 feasible. Except for some measurements of standards and backgrounds for Be- 10 measurements to date have been on C- 14. Although most results have been in archaeology and quaternary geology, studies have been expanded to include cosmogenic C- 14 in meteorites. The data obtained so far tend to confirm the antiquity of Antarctic meteorites from the Allan Hills site. Data on three samples of Yamato meteorites gave terrestrial ages of between about 3 and 22 thousand years...|$|R
