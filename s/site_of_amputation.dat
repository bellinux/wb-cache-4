40|$|The role {{of normal}} {{innervation}} in the regeneration of crustacean appendages has been illustrated in previous papers (Needham, 1945, 1946); it may, perhaps, be termed the 'central ' factor in regeneration. In {{the present paper}} 'local ' factors, such as properties of the tissues near the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>amputation,</b> have been studied. The results of earlier work, chiefly on Amphibia, Planaria and Oligochaeta (Korschelt, 1927, pp. 639 - 40), {{have suggested that the}} rate of regeneration varies with (1) the extent of tissue damage at the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>amputation</b> and (2) the amount of tissue removed. These two factors have been studied in the present experiments on the regeneration of the 7 th thoracic limb of Asellus aquaticus (L.). METHOD The general procedure was as in previous experiments (Needham, 1945, 1946). The effect of damaged tissue at the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>amputation</b> was assessed by comparing the length of a normally regenerating limb at its first eclosion (its 'eclosion length', e. l.) with that of the partner limb regenerating in the presence of damaged tissue.

40|$|Background: Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) {{injections}} are {{an effective}} treatment for controlling hyperhidrosis at <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>amputation.</b> Hyperesthesia associated with amputated limbs {{is a major}} barrier to performing this procedure under local anesthesia. Objective: To present a novel method for improving local anesthesia with BTX-A injections. Methods & Results: A 29 -year-old military veteran with a below-the-knee <b>amputation</b> <b>of</b> his right leg was suffering from amputation site hyperhidrosis, which was impeding his ability to comfortably wear a prosthesis. Prior to presenting to our clinic, the patient received one treatment of BTX-A injections to his amputation stump while under general anesthesia for surgical repair of trauma-related injuries. In our dermatology clinic, we repeated the procedure using topical lidocaine-prilocaine (30 gm total) for local anesthesia. This provided effective relief of hyperhidrosis for 6 months, but the procedure was very painful (9 / 10 intensity). We repeated the same procedure 6 months later, using ice in addition to topical lidocaine-prilocaine (30 gm) for local anesthesia; this resulted in reduced pain (3 / 10 intensity) for the patient. Conclusions: We suggest using ice in combination with a topical anesthetic as an effective method for pain control that avoids general anesthesia in treating amputation-associated hyperhidrosis. ...|$|R
40|$|The smooth {{paths of}} {{progress}} are often crossed by rough tracks {{some of which}} may provide short cuts and rapid advance, but not infrequently a track may lead into ruts which retard progress. So with amputation surgery, the story of which is {{a large part of the}} history of surgery itself until the latter part of the nineteenth century. From the cruel chopper and boiling oil methods, amputations were rescued by Ambrose Pare. The next advance was with the introduction of primary end closure of stumps by flaps. The needs of surgical speed remained an obstacle to progress until the introduction of anaesthesia. Full advantage of this could not be taken until the control of sepsis made it possible to plan amputations with precision: as will be seen later the techniques involved are still matters for discussion. Surgery, however, is only part of the clinical problem, the other half of which is prosthetic rehabilitation. Too often artificial limbs have been regarded as a non-surgical matter: indeed, from the days of the armour makers, technicians have been left to do their best.

40|$|Targeted Muscle Reinnervation is a {{relatively}} new surgical procedure that endeavors to make control of upper-limb prostheses more intuitive for amputees. This procedure reroutes residual nerve bundles from an amputated limb to muscles in the chest or proximal to the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>amputation</b> in the arm, producing EMGs in response to motor commands. These EMGs are traditionally collected using surface electrodes. Research is ongoing to design an implantable electrode that can read these EMG signals directly from the muscle, which would increase the integrity of the retrieved signal by creating more permanent, stable connections between the muscles and the signal collectors. A robotic arm testing system was developed in order to test the efficacy of these implantable electrodes and demonstrate a complete system from EMG signal retrieval to motion triggering in an upper-limb prosthetic. This robotic arm offers up to six degrees of freedom intended to closely replicate the capabilities of a biological arm.

In addition, its implications for designing low-cost prostheses for the Third World will be explored and discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Regeneration of {{appendages}} is frequent among invertebrates {{as well as}} some vertebrates. However, in mammals {{this has}} been largely relegated to digit tip regeneration, as found in mice and humans. The regenerated structures are formed from a mound of undifferentiated cells called a blastema, found just below the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>amputation.</b> The blastema ultimately gives rise to all of the tissues in the regenerate, excluding the epidermis, and has classically been thought of as a homogenous pool of pluripotent stem cells derived by dedifferentiation of stump tissue, although this has never been directly tested in the context of mammalian digit tip regeneration. Successful digit tip regeneration requires that the level of amputation be within the nail bed and depends on expression of Msx 1. Because Msx 1 is strongly expressed in the nail bed mesenchyme, it has been proposed that the Msx 1 -expressing cells represent a pluripotent cell population for the regenerating digit. In this report, we show that Msx 1 is dynamically expressed during digit tip regeneration, and it does not mark a pluripotent stem cell population. Moreover, we show that both the ectoderm and mesoderm contain fate-restricted progenitor populations that work in concert to regenerate their own lineages within the digit tip, supporting the hypothesis that the blastema is a heterogeneous pool of progenitor cells...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyse {{the outcome}} <b>of</b> minor <b>amputations</b> (through, or distal to, the ankle joint) in {{patients}} with diabetes. METHOD: All diabetic patients in a defined population undergoing one or more minor amputation between 1982 and 2006 were investigated according to a standardised protocol and were followed until final outcome (healing or death). A total <b>of</b> 410 consecutive <b>amputations</b> in 309 patients with a median age of 73 (32 - 93) years were identified. RESULTS: In 94 % <b>of</b> <b>amputations,</b> deep infection (39 %) and/or gangrene (55 %) was present. Severe peripheral vascular disease or critical limb ischaemia was present in 61 % <b>of</b> <b>amputations.</b> 261 / 410 (64 %) <b>of</b> the <b>amputations</b> healed at a level below the ankle joint; 69 / 410 (17 %) healed after a re-amputation above the ankle joint; in 76 / 410 <b>of</b> <b>amputations</b> (19 %), the patient died before healing could occur. In surviving patients, 79 % <b>of</b> the <b>amputations</b> healed below the ankle. Median healing time for amputations that healed below the ankle was 26 (2 - 250) weeks; 21 % <b>of</b> <b>amputations</b> required a re-amputation above the ankle. None of the analysed parameters excluded the possibility of healing below the ankle.

40|$|Background Phantom limb pain is {{a common}} problem after limb {{amputation}} (41 - 85 %). It is described as an extremely painful sensation in the missing {{part of the body}} that can last for hours, days or even years. It is considered to arise from cortical reorganization, although many factors can increase the risk of phantom limb pain: pain before surgery, age and sex of the patients, the time elapsed since surgery, stump pain, inadequate prosthesis. Phantom limb pain therapy is very complicated. Case report We reported a case of 80 -year-old patient suffering from phantom limb pain and phantom sensation 25 years after the amputation of his left leg due to the injury. The patient has pain at the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>amputation,</b> sensation that he has the leg and that it occupies an unusual position and almost daily exhausting phantom limb pain (6 - 9 visual analogue scale - VAS) with disturbed sleep and mood. We managed to reduce the pain under 4 VAS and decrease the patient suffering by combining drugs from the group of coanalgetics (antidepressants, antiepileptics), non-pharmacological methods (transcutaneous electroneurostimulation - TENS, mirror therapy) and femoral nerve block in the place of disarticulation of the left thigh. Conclusion Phantom limb pain therapy is multimodal, exhausting for both the patient and the physician and it is often unsuccessful. The combination of different pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities can give satisfactory therapeutic response...|$|E
40|$|Urodeles and fetal mammals {{are capable}} of {{impressive}} epimorphic regeneration {{in a variety of}} tissues, whereas the typical default response to injury in adult mammals consists of inflammation and scar tissue formation. One component of epimorphic regeneration is the recruitment of resident progenitor and stem cells to a site of injury. Bioactive molecules resulting from degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) have been shown to recruit a variety of progenitor and stem cells in vitro in adult mammals. The ability to recruit multipotential cells to the site of injury by in vivo administration of chemotactic ECM degradation products in a mammalian model of digit amputation was investigated in the present study. Adult, 6 - to 8 -week-old C 57 /BL 6 mice were subjected to midsecond phalanx amputation of the third digit of the right hind foot and either treated with chemotactic ECM degradation products or left untreated. At 14 days after amputation, mice treated with ECM degradation products showed an accumulation of heterogeneous cells that expressed markers of multipotency, including Sox 2, Sca 1, and Rex 1 (Zfp 42). Cells isolated from the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>amputation</b> were capable of differentiation along neuroectodermal and mesodermal lineages, whereas cells isolated from control mice were capable of differentiation along only mesodermal lineages.

40|$|Biologic {{scaffolds}} {{composed of}} extracellular matrix (ECM) {{have been used}} to promote site-specific, functional remodeling of tissue in both preclinical animal models and human clinical applications. Although the mechanisms of action of ECM scaffolds are not completely understood, proteolytic degradation of the ECM scaffold and subsequent progenitor cell recruitment are thought to be important mediators of the constructive remodeling process. Proteolytic degradation of the ECM scaffolds results in the generation and release of cryptic peptides with novel bioactive properties not associated with their parent molecules such as angiogenic, antimicrobial, mitogenic, and chemotactic properties. While previous studies have suggested that degradation products of ECM scaffolds are chemotactic for progenitor cells in vitro, the present thesis expands upon these findings in vivo. In a non-regenerating model of mid-second phalanx digit amputation, treatment with ECM degradation rpodcuts resulted in the accumulation of a heterogeneous population of cells with in vitro differentiation potential along osteogenic, adipogenic, and neuroectodermal lineages. Focusing specifically on the Sox 2 + population of cells found at the site of injury, work in the present thesis showed that Sox 2 + cells co-express bone marrow and periosteal stem cell markers CD 90 and Sca 1, but not dermal stem cell marker CD 133 or circulating stem cell marker c-kit (CD 117). Additionally, bone marrow chimeric studies utilizing wild type C 57 /BL 6 and Sox 2 eGFP/+ mice showed that the Sox 2 + cells are not derived from the bone marrow, but more likely from a local tissue source such as the periosteum. Fractionation of the ECM degradation products resulted in the identification of a highly conserved cryptic peptide derived from the C-terminal telopeptide of the collagen type IIIα molecule with chemotactic activity for multiple progenitor cells in vitro, IAGVGGEKSGGF. Administration of the cryptic peptide in a model of digit amputation resulted in the accumulation of Sox 2 +, Sca 1 +, Lin- cells at the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>amputation.</b> Peptide treatment also resulted in the formation of a bone nodule at the site that coincided with the spatial location of Sox 2 + cells. In vitro, the peptide accelerated osteogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells and increased the expression of osteogenic and chondrogenic genes. The result of this body of work shows that degradation products of ECM scaffolds contain cryptic peptides with the ability to influence chemotaxis and differentiation of progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|Background: Lower {{extremity}} amputation {{has different}} etiologies {{and the purpose}} of the study was to describe the demographics and etiologies <b>of</b> <b>amputations.</b> This study was designed to evaluate amputations performed in the province of Eastern Azerbaijan (north-west of Iran) and to       determine specific causes <b>of</b> <b>amputations</b> associated with geographical and cultural characteristics of the region.   Methods: We have done this retrospective and descriptive study from June 1 st, 2005 to June 1 st, 2010 in Tabriz Shohada Hospital (Tabriz, Iran). The patients were evaluated with respect to age, sex, etiology, side and level <b>of</b> <b>amputations,</b> prevalence <b>of</b> <b>amputations</b> among the sexes at different ages and surgical interventions performed. Results: One-hundred-sixty files were identified with a diagnosis <b>of</b> lower limb <b>amputation.</b> Trauma was the most frequent cause in 67 cases (46 %), followed by vascular disease in 61 cases (42 %), and then infection in 18 cases (12 %).

Conclusion: This investigation shows that trauma (especially due to car accidents) is the most common cause <b>of</b> <b>amputations</b> in our region, followed by vascular problems...|$|R
40|$|Complete and {{functional}} regrowth of arms in echinoderms depends on several factors. Probably {{the most crucial}} are the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>amputation</b> along the proximal-distal axis of the arm, particularly important in crinoids (Candia Carnevali et al 1995), and the ambient temperature, {{as seen in the}} ophiuroid A. filiformis (Mallefet et al 2000). Indeed, a traumatic amputation that does not follow the natural autotomy plane may involve more complex reparative/regenerative mechanisms and therefore may be slower compared to the non traumatic (Candia Carnevali et al 1995). Whatever the selected regenerative ‘pathway’, massive tissue rearrangement and strong up-regulation of cell proliferation/differentiation was detected in all the species investigated in this thesis. However, the time course of these events does vary dependent upon the regenerative ‘pathways’. During the arm regeneration process, these animals might experience stress which may be accompanied by a large turnover of protein. Generally, when an organism is subject to metabolic and environmental stressors, a common protective mechanism, known as the stress response, is activated (Srinivas and Swamynathan 1996; Morimoto 1998). This results in the expression of heat-shock proteins (Hsps). It is known that Hsps, which are encoded by highly conserved families of genes, play key roles not only in the correct folding of proteins (and hence repair processes following damage) but also during normal development (Becker and Craig 1994). One specific example occurs in Drosophila where small increases in Hsp 70 expression during development enhances thermotolerance (Feder 1999) but if overexpression of the Hsp 70 gene is induced, larval mortality increases and development slows down (Krebs and Feder 1997). Amongst invertebrates, echinoderms are well known for their extensive capacity for regeneration following natural predation-induced trauma or as a part of reproductive strategy (Candia Carnevali et al 1998). Echinoderm classes with arms are often subject to frequent arm loss. Clearly such autotomy followed by subsequent repair and regeneration is likely to represent a stressful event. Ubiquitin is a small, (76 amino acids) highly conserved phylogenetically, protein and is present in all eukaryotes (Finley and Chau, 1991; Hochstrasser, 1996). Although ubiquitin occurs free in the cell, it is most commonly found covalently conjugated {{to a wide range of}} target proteins. This conjugation is a reversible post-translational modification, which has been implicated, in numerous biological processes. Ubiquitin plays important roles in a range of cellular functions including the cell cycle, DNA replication, DNA repair and signal transduction (Deshaise 1995; Muller and Schwartz 1995; King et al 1996). One important and well-known function of ubiquitination is to target proteins for rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome, a protease complex present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Arrigo et al 1988). In this ATP-dependent pathway, a protein is tagged with poly-ubiquitin chains via isopeptide bonds, which are formed between the carboxyl terminal glycine of ubiquitin molecules and the ε-amino groups of lysine residues in other ubiquitin molecules. This ubiquitinating reaction (Fig. 1) is catalysed by sequential actions of E 1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), E 2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and often E 3 (ubiquitin-ligase). When cells are exposed to heat shock, many aberrant proteins are produced and the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway (the ubiquitin-proteasome system) is believed to play a key role in rapid degradation of these abnormal proteins (Schwartz and Ciechanover 1999). In contrast, some proteins, such as the histones H 2 A and H 2 B, are ubiquitinated but not subsequently degraded. It is still unclear whether these ubiquitin molecules are attached to histones via the poly-ubiquitin chain or not. Thus, it is still uncertain why and how ubiquitinated histones are deubiquitinated in response to heat-shock, during chromosome condensation in the mitotic cell cycle, in apoptosis and during neuronal differentiation in PC 12 h cells (Bond et al 1988; Takada et al 1994; Marushige and Marushige 1995) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Proximal major limb amputations due to {{malignant}} tumors {{have become}} rare {{but are still}} a valuable treatment option in palliation {{and in some cases}} can even cure. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyse outcome in those patients, including the postoperative course, survival, pain, quality of life, and prosthesis usage. Methods Data of 45 consecutive patients was acquired from patient's charts and contact to patients, and general practitioners. Patients with interscapulothoracic amputation (n = 14), shoulder disarticulation (n = 13), hemipelvectomy (n = 3) or hip disarticulation (n = 15) were included. Results The rate of proximal major limb amputations in patients treated for sarcoma was 2. 3 % (37 out of 1597). Survival for all patients was 42. 9 % after one year and 12. 7 % after five years. Survival was significantly better in patients with complete tumor resections. Postoperative chemotherapy and radiation did not prolong survival. Eighteen percent of the patients with malignant disease developed local recurrence. In 44 %, postoperative complications were observed. Different modalities of postoperative pain management and the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the <b>amputation</b> had no significant influence on long-term pain assessment and quality of life. Eighty-seven percent suffered from phantom pain, 15. 6 % considered their quality of life worse than before the operation. Thirty-two percent of the patients who received a prosthesis used it regularly. Conclusion Proximal major limb amputations severely interfere with patients' body function and are the last, albeit valuable, option within the treatment concept of extremity malignancies or severe infections. Besides short survival, high complication rates, and postoperative pain, patients' quality of life can be improved for the time they have remaining. </p...|$|R
