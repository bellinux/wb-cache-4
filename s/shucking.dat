Not satisfied with the amount of money Wetch handed over, they placed a bag over his head and beat him. Though he escaped the ordeal with only minor injuries, he promised himself he would only make one more road trip to gather a stake, and then he would quit. He made that final trip and used the money to open up a pool room with partner David Wagner, Jimmy's Pro Billiards in Columbia Heights, Minnesota.

To store corn with short, loose <b>shucks</b> results in greatly increased loss. <b>Shucks</b> that {{extend beyond the}} tips of the ears and close tightly about the silks are weevil proof both in the field and in storage.

500|$|Grant has {{predominantly}} been {{a comedy}} (especially a romantic comedy) actor {{for almost all}} of his mainstream film career. He also never ventures to play characters who are not British.

[...] A majority of Grant's popular films in the 1990s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love, often with an American woman. In earlier films, Grant was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed Englishman for humorous effects, allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously. These performances were sometimes deemed overbearing, {{in the words of}} Washington Posts Rita Kempley, due to his [...] "comic overreactions—the mugging, the stuttering, the fluttering eyelids." [...] She added: [...] "He's got more tics than Benny Hill." [...] Grant's penchant for conveying his characters' feelings with mannerisms, rather than direct emotions, {{has been one of the}} foremost objections raised against his acting style. Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post once stated that, to be effective as a comic performer, he must get [...] "his jiving and <b>shucking</b> under control."

Preston Jones from Slant Magazine called it [...] "frustrating, uneven, and strained ... an interesting failure". Spin magazine's Charles Aaron called it [...] "a perplexing album", despite how it [...] "grasps for a distinctive sound, departing almost entirely from rap per se" [...] in favor of music from [...] "the jazz/jump blues from the film's '30s/40's demimonde, as well as shades of Prince's most fitfully eclectic periods".|$|E

2500|$|Before World War II, most maize in North America was {{harvested}} by hand. This {{involved a}} {{large numbers of}} workers and associated social events (husking or <b>shucking</b> bees). From the 1890s onward, some machinery became available to partially mechanize the processes, such as one- and two-row mechanical pickers (picking the ear, leaving the stover) and corn binders, which are reaper-binders designed specifically for maize (for example, [...] ). The latter produce sheaves that can be shocked. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested, which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of maize were often stored in corn cribs, and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Today corn cribs with whole ears, and corn binders, are less common because most modern farms harvest the grain from the field with a combine and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and snap rolls instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground, where it usually is left to become organic matter for the soil. The ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away, leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery. The combine separates out the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.|$|E
