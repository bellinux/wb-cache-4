40|$|The {{population}} <b>of</b> <b>ungulates</b> {{depends on}} the habitat factors and prey-predator interaction. This study aims to explore the habitat preference <b>of</b> <b>ungulates</b> and their relation with associated predators in the Bardia National Park, Nepal. The study {{was based on the}} transect survey and indirect observation <b>of</b> <b>ungulates.</b> Spotted deer recorded the highest density and blue bull recorded the lowest. Hog deer preferred mostly flood plains habitat and barking deer preferring mixed hardwood forest and tall grass flood plains. However, barking deer completely avoided the riverine forest and flood plain habitats. Swamp deer preferred Phata (grassland) and blue bull was recorded only in flood plains. The higher concentration of ungulates’ pellet groups were found in areas close to water sources. The study concluded that different habitat features influence the distribution and abundance <b>of</b> <b>ungulates.</b> The higher density of spotted deer and hog deer suggests these species as the major prey base to maintain viable populations of tigers in the park...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine taxonomic {{homogenization}} in ungulates globally and at the local scale in South Africa. Specifically, we aim to examine the roles of distance, scale, time, extinctions vs. introductions, and extralimital vs. extraregional introductions in the homogenization <b>of</b> <b>ungulate</b> biotas, and to determine pathways <b>of</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>ungulate</b> species globally and the proximate explanatory variables <b>of</b> <b>ungulate</b> introductions in South Africa. Location: Forty-one countries globally and three spatial resolutions in South Africa. Methods: Indigenous, extirpated and established introduced ungulate species data were obtained for countries globally, and at a quarter-degree grid-cell resolution in South Africa. Homogenization was calculated using Jaccard's index of similarity (JI) for countries globally and for three spatial resolutions in South Africa. Zoo holdings and transfer data from the International Species Information System database were used to investigate the relationship between non-indigenous ungulate species introductions and the number <b>of</b> non-indigenous <b>ungulate</b> species in zoos. Relationships between JI and species richness, and between numbers of introductions and several environmental and social factors were examined using generalized linear models. Results: Homogenization in ungulates was 2 % for countries globally and 8 % at the coarsest resolution in South Africa. Homogenization increased with increasing resolution and with time, but it decreased with increasing percentage change in species richness. Globally, introductions contributed more to homogenization than did extinctions. Within South Africa, extralimital introductions contributed more to the homogenization <b>of</b> <b>ungulate</b> assemblages than did extraregional ones, and ungulates were typically introduced to high-income areas with high human population and livestock densities. The same was not true in the past, when ungulates were introduced to ungulate species-poor areas. The number <b>of</b> non-indigenous <b>ungulate</b> species established in a country is significantly related to the number <b>of</b> non-indigenous <b>ungulate</b> species in zoos in the country, possibly owing to sales of surplus animals from zoos. Main conclusions: Ungulate faunas are homogenized at both the global scale and in South Africa, with extralimital introductions being of considerable significance regionally. In consequence, increasing attention will have to be given to the conservation consequences <b>of</b> <b>ungulate</b> translocations, both within particular geopolitical regions and across the globe. © 2008 The Authors.

40|$|Despite {{conceptual}} {{recognition that}} indirect effects initiated by large herbivores {{are likely to}} have profound impacts on ecological community structure and function, the existing literature on indirect effects focuses largely on the role of predators. As a result, we know neither the frequency and extent of herbivore-initiated indirect effects nor the mechanisms that regulate their strength. We examined the effects <b>of</b> <b>ungulates</b> on taxa (plants, arthropods, and an insectivorous lizard) representing several trophic levels, using a series of large, long-term, ungulate-exclusion plots that span a landscape-scale productivity gradient in an African savanna. At each of six sites, lizards, trees, and the numerically dominant order of arthropods (Coleoptera) were more abundant in the absence <b>of</b> <b>ungulates.</b> The effect <b>of</b> <b>ungulates</b> on arthropods was mediated by herbaceous vegetation cover. The effect on lizards was simultaneously mediated by both tree density (lizard microhabitat) and arthropod abundance (lizard food). The magnitudes of the experimental effects on all response variables (trees, arthropods, and lizards) were negatively correlated with two distinct measures of primary productivity. These results demonstrate strong cascading effects <b>of</b> <b>ungulates,</b> both trophic and nontrophic, and support the hypothesis that productivity regulates the strength of these effects. Hence, the strongest indirect effects (and thus, the greatest risks to ecosystem integrity after large mammals are extirpated) are likely to occur in low-productivity habitats...|$|R

Ungulate-vehicle collisions are a major road safety issue which causes considerable mortality among many species. It also leads to huge animal suffering and reduce the animal welfare. If several ungulate-vehicle collisions occur at the same site they will create a cluster <b>of</b> <b>ungulate</b> accidents. Those places represent high risk areas for human and animal safety. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the stability <b>of</b> clusters <b>of</b> <b>ungulate</b> accidents with moose, roe deer, fallow deer, red deer and wild boar from 2010 to 2015 to investigate if the clusters that have been stable and the stability of those clusters differ between the species.

Further, the purpose of this study was also to investigate whether the differences in ungulate social organization may contribute to the stability of the clusters.

40|$|Monitoring {{programmes}} {{and studies}} focused on secondary sexual characters (SSCs) {{depend on the}} accuracy of measurements. However, methods of measurements of SSC, such as horns <b>of</b> <b>ungulates,</b> vary throughout the literature. Thus, the accuracy of horn growth measurements as proxies of true horn growth and the comparability of results inferred from different horn growth measurements may be questionable. We used the horns of Iberian ibex Capra pyrenaica to compare horn growth measurements and to analyse reliability with true horn growth. Our results reveal that measurements used in previous studies differed substantially from true horn growth and volume estimated as a barrel appeared as the best proxy of annular segments of horns in the Iberian ibex. Horn growth measurements are not necessarily mutually comparable, just as classical measurements are not necessarily representative of true horn growth. We discuss the wider implications of these results and suggest that biological processes linked to horns <b>of</b> <b>ungulates</b> should be reappraised using improved and accurate measurements because horn growth pattern is {{a key factor in}} sustainable management and conservation plans <b>of</b> <b>ungulate</b> species around the world.

40|$|The {{current issue}} of Tropical Conservation Science is the first special issue {{published}} by TCS and it focuses on a very important group <b>of</b> mammals, the <b>ungulates,</b> in a megadiverse country in the Neotropics, Mexico [1]. The guest editors for this issue are Dr. Sonia Gallina and Dr. Salvador Mandujano, research scientists at the Instituto de Ecologia, A. C. in Mexico. Drs. Gallina and Mandujano took the initiative in proposing, organizing and assembling the special issue. All papers in this special issue went through a peer-review process. To place the special issue in perspective, the following comments may be relevant. According to the Smithsonian Institution there are about 257 recognized species <b>of</b> <b>ungulates</b> world-wide [2]. <b>Of</b> these, at least five species have gone extinct in the last 300 years due to anthropogenic pressures, and many other species are of critical conservation concern [2]. Ungulates account {{for the vast majority}} of large herbivores currently on earth and their native range includes all zoogeographic regions except Antarctica [3]. With human help, ungulates have expanded also into many geographical regions in the globe and in others, where they had become extinct, they have been reintroduced, e. g., the horse in the American continent [4, 5]. In the American continent there are 34 reported species <b>of</b> <b>ungulates,</b> representing 13 % <b>of</b> the <b>ungulate</b> species worldwide [6].
