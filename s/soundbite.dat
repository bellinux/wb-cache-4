Royal was criticised by French and international media by what was called 'mangling the French language' in a <b>soundbite</b> delivered on the Great Wall of China. She used the word bravitude instead of the word bravoure, which means bravery.|$|E

500|$|On {{his third}} day in Washington, Diệm was {{the keynote speaker}} and guest at a National Press Club lunch. He {{attacked}} Asian leaders who advocated neutralism, saying that [...] "Since communism is not neutral, we cannot be neutral". This impressed the media, who prominently noted Diệm's unequivocal stance in their reports. The Pulitzer Prize-winning Marguerite Higgins of the New York Herald Tribune said that [...] "it is a refreshingalmost startlingexperience to hear this Asian hero assert forthrightly: 'communism isn't neutral, therefore we cannot be neutral.'... He made himself unique among recent Asian visitors... by the decisiveness with which he publicly chose up sides with the United States and against the communists". In her critique, Higgins again criticized the stances of Nehru and Sukarno. Such was the impact of Diệm's <b>soundbite</b> that the AFV thereafter {{used it as a}} headline quote in their mailouts and campaigns.|$|E
500|$|The fifth track, [...] "Like the Angel", {{begins with}} {{strumming}} of the bass guitar, before transitioning into a [...] "poppy" [...] beat about unrequited love. [...] "Voices Off Camera" [...] {{is one of}} the more accessible songs on the album, with McIlrath singing in a softer voice. In contrast, [...] "Blood-Red, White, & Blue" [...] is described by Matthew Fiander of PopMatters as a [...] "musical tour de force" [...] and as a [...] "catchy song", with a moody breakdown. With it, McIlrath wanted to write a song that showcased the conflict of interests following the September 11 attacks, between overt patriotism, and war crimes in the name of God. The eighth track, [...] "Broken English", [...] "switches tempo constantly", and has motivational lyrics in the chorus. McIlrath describes [...] "Last Chance Blueprint" [...] as the band's [...] "escape song", while Fiander feels it is a [...] "stock get-out-of-town tune". It contains a <b>soundbite</b> from the 1999 film American Beauty.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2016, Black was the 'castaway' on Desert Island Discs. When {{asked about}} the Prime Minister's idea she sounded lukewarm, saying the real {{question}} was: [...] "How do you trigger the right response in people? Because lecturing people, bashing them on the head - on the whole, we know - doesn't get us there". Kirsty Young, the presenter, suggested that Black was [...] "somebody who might think that a simplistic political <b>soundbite</b> isn't even beginning to address the underlying issues of, culturally, what we're finding such a problem right now". Black replied: [...] "What I would say {{is that this is}} a hugely complex problem and not one thing alone will ever solve it".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, the media became more {{important}} in Congress's work. Analyst Michael Schudson suggested that greater publicity undermined the power of political parties and caused [...] "more roads to open up in Congress for individual representatives to influence decisions". Norman Ornstein suggested that media prominence led to {{a greater emphasis on}} the negative and sensational side of Congress, and referred to this as the tabloidization of media coverage. Others saw pressure to squeeze a political position into a thirty-second <b>soundbite.</b> A report characterized Congress in 2013 as being unproductive, gridlocked, and [...] "setting records for futility". In October 2013, with Congress unable to compromise, the government was shut down for several weeks and risked a serious default on debt payments, causing 60% of the public to say they would [...] "fire every member of Congress" [...] including their own representative. One report suggested Congress posed the [...] "biggest risk to the US economy" [...] because of its brinksmanship, [...] "down-to-the-wire budget and debt crises" [...] and [...] "indiscriminate spending cuts", resulting in slowed economic activity and keeping up to two million people unemployed. There has been increasing public dissatisfaction with Congress, with extremely low approval ratings which dropped to 5% in October 2013.|$|E
50|$|A multi-center {{clinical}} trial conducted in 2011 validated that <b>SoundBite</b> {{is safe and}} effective and provides substantial benefit for individuals with single-sided deafness (SSD). Trial participants wore <b>SoundBite</b> for 30 days, using the device an average of 8.2 hours per day. Based on the {{clinical trial}} results, <b>SoundBite</b> improves the ability of individuals with SSD to understand speech in an environment with background noise {{by an average of}} 25%. One-third of the trial participants found that the system improved their hearing ability by more than 30%. The results of this extensive clinical trial showed <b>SoundBite</b> to be as effective as surgically implanted bone conduction systems in improving the ability to understand speech in an environment with background noise.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, another multi-center {{clinical}} study confirmed previous findings that <b>SoundBite</b> is safe, effective, and provides significant benefit for patients. Study participants wore <b>SoundBite</b> for 6 month. Benefit was determined through a standard audiological questionnaire called the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB), and a patient survey. Results from the APHAB questionnaire showed patients had {{significant improvement in}} Ease of Communication, Reverberation, Background Noise, and Global Benefit. Additionally, the patient survey showed strong satisfaction with the device: 100% would recommend <b>SoundBite</b> to a friend or familty member with similar hearing loss.|$|E
