5|$|Other {{observations}} in Hurricanes Anita, David, Frederic, and Allen {{also discovered that}} tropical cyclones have very little <b>supercooled</b> <b>water</b> {{and a great deal}} of ice crystals. The reason that tropical cyclones have little <b>supercooled</b> <b>water</b> is that the updrafts within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing. As cloud seeding needed <b>supercooled</b> <b>water</b> to function, the lack of <b>supercooled</b> <b>water</b> meant that seeding would have no effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{was that the}} silver iodide would cause <b>supercooled</b> <b>water</b> in the storm to freeze, disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane. This led to the seeding of several Atlantic hurricanes. However, it was later shown that this {{hypothesis was}} incorrect. It was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough <b>supercooled</b> <b>water</b> for cloud seeding to be effective. Additionally, researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes. This finding called Stormfury's successes into question, as the changes reported now had a natural explanation.|$|E

For example, floods from Hurricane Kathleen devastated Ocotillo, California and killed several people. Precipitation other than rainfall is unusual in tropical cyclones, because of their weak updrafts and lack of <b>supercooled</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{continues the}} development of new instrumentation relevant to the advancement of cloud seeding technology and the analysis of data collected to better understand cloud seeding potential in winter orographic clouds. Instrumentation development included the state of construction of a NOAA type dual frequency radiometer for the continuous measurement of <b>supercooled</b> liquid <b>water</b> and the completion of an expendable balloon-borne system for measuring vertical profiles of <b>supercooled</b> liquid <b>water.</b> The analysis of data collected on the project was directed primarily at the interpretation of the vertical profiles of <b>supercooled</b> liquid <b>water</b> and vertical motion. Results indicate that sharp vertical gradients of <b>supercooled</b> liquid <b>water</b> often exist in winter orographic clouds. The relationships between measured <b>supercooled</b> liquid <b>water</b> and other variables strongly support previous findings that the precipitation augmentation potential of winter orographic clouds is substantial when the cloud top temperature is - 22 °C or warmer ad the cross-barrier wind speed (at mountaintop levels) is 8 m s - 1 or greater...|$|R

5|$|Lightning is an {{electrical}} discharge {{that occurs in}} a thunderstorm. It {{can be seen in}} the form of a bright streak (or bolt) from the sky. Lightning occurs when {{an electrical}} charge is built up within a cloud, due to static electricity generated by <b>supercooled</b> <b>water</b> droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level. When a large enough charge is built up, a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States {{government}} {{attempted to}} weaken hurricanes through Project Stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver iodide. It {{was thought that}} the seeding would cause <b>supercooled</b> <b>water</b> in the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds. The winds of Hurricane Debbie—a hurricane seeded in Project Stormfury—dropped as much as 31%, but Debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays. In an earlier episode in 1947, disaster struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville, Florida promptly changed its course after being seeded, and smashed into Savannah, Georgia. Because {{there was so much}} uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal government would not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10% chance of making landfall within 48 hours, greatly reducing the number of possible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes, casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts. Today, it is known that silver iodide seeding is not likely to have an effect because the amount of <b>supercooled</b> <b>water</b> in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.|$|E
5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens {{most often in}} clouds above freezing, and {{is also known as}} the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as <b>supercooled</b> <b>water</b> droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.|$|E
30|$|In {{the last}} decade, using {{nanoparticles}} as nucleating agents is the widespread and leading method that researchers have adopted {{to control the}} <b>supercooling</b> degrees of <b>water.</b> The commonly used nanoparticles are metal and metal oxide, such as TiO 2, Al 2 O 3, Cu, and CuO [3 – 6]. These nanoparticles are hydrophilic and can facilitate the formation of ice nuclei by decreasing the Gibbs free energy of nucleation. Other hydrophobic nanoparticles, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoplatelets, have also been used as nucleating agents by some researchers [7 – 9]. The reduction of <b>supercooling</b> degree of <b>water</b> is attributed to the high specific surface areas of nanoparticles, which can provide more nucleation sites and increase the nucleation probability at high temperatures. According to the literature, different nanoparticles have different nucleation effects; moreover, nanoparticles with high specific areas can eliminate the <b>supercooling</b> of <b>water,</b> whereas those nanoparticles with hydrophilicity not. For example, adding {{a small amount of}} graphene nanoplatelets (0.02  wt.%) can eliminate the <b>supercooling</b> of <b>water</b> [8], whereas a reduction of only 70.9 % in supercooling degree can be achieved by using TiO 2 nanoparticles (1.0  wt.%) [4]. Thus, increasing the number of foreign nucleation sites can be a better method to control the <b>supercooling</b> of <b>water,</b> compared with improving the hydrophilicity of nucleating agents.|$|R
40|$|Mixed-phase {{layer clouds}} are radiatively {{important}} and their correct representation in numerical {{models of the}} atmosphere is needed for both weather forecasts and climate prediction. In particular, midlevel mixed-phase layer clouds (altocumulus) are often poorly predicted. Here the representation of altocumulus cloud in five operational models and the ERA-Interim reanalysis is evaluated using ground-based remote sensors. All models are found to underestimate the <b>supercooled</b> liquid <b>water</b> content by at least a factor of 2. The models with the most sophisticated microphysics (separate prognostic variables for liquid and ice) had least supercooled liquid of all models, though they could simulate the correct liquid-over-ice structure of individual clouds. To investigate {{the reasons for the}} lack of predicted <b>supercooled</b> liquid <b>water,</b> a single-column model (EMPIRE) was developed incorporating the relevant physical processes for altocumulus cloud. The <b>supercooled</b> liquid <b>water</b> was found to be the most sensitive to factors that significantly affect the glaciation rate, including aspects of the ice microphysics formulation, as well as the model vertical resolution. Using observations to improve the ice particle size distribution formulation and the parametrization of ice cloud fraction also lead to a significant increase in <b>supercooled</b> liquid <b>water</b> in the simulated clouds. The study highlights the main parameterized processes that need careful attention in large-scale models in order to adequately represent the liquid phase in mixed-phase layer clouds. In Part 2, the reason for the sensitivity to vertical resolution is investigated and a new parameterization for models with coarse vertical resolution is proposed...|$|R

5|$|Jet stream-powered cirrus {{can grow}} {{long enough to}} stretch across continents while {{remaining}} only a few kilometers deep. When visible light interacts with the ice crystals in cirrus cloud, it produces optical phenomena such as sun dogs and halos. Cirrus is known to raise {{the temperature of the}} air beneath the main cloud layer by an average of 10°C (18°F). When the individual filaments become so extensive that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another, they form a sheet of high cloud called cirrostratus. Convection at high altitudes can produce another high-based genus called cirrocumulus, a pattern of small cloud tufts that contain droplets of <b>supercooled</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} often {{precursors}} of {{other types of}} cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapor, <b>supercooled</b> <b>water</b> droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus. (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|E
5|$|Snow {{refers to}} forms of ice {{crystals}} that precipitate {{from the atmosphere}} (usually from clouds) and undergo changes on the Earth's surface. It pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting <b>supercooled</b> <b>water</b> droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take {{on a variety of}} shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of homochiral domains in <b>supercooled</b> liquid <b>water</b> is presented using molecular dynamics simulations. An individual water molecule possesses neither a chiral center nor a twisted conformation {{that can cause}} spontaneous chiral resolution. However, an aggregation of water molecules will naturally {{give rise to a}} collective chirality. Such homochiral domains possess obvious topological and geometrical orders and are energetically more stable than the average. However, homochiral domains cannot grow into macroscopic homogeneous structures due to geometrical frustrations arising from their icosahedral local order. Homochiral domains are the major constituent of <b>supercooled</b> liquid <b>water</b> and the origin of heterogeneity in that substance, and are expected to be enhanced in low-density amorphous ice at lower temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Water is {{an unusual}} liquid. It expands upon freezing, has minima in its volume, heat capacity, and {{isothermal}} compressibility with temperature, and shows signs of a first-order phase transition when supercooled. These anomalies disappear at high pressures. We review a recent analytical theory that predicts water’s thermal properties and the main features of its phase diagram, including multiple crystalline phases and a fluid–fluid transition in the supercooled liquid. It also predicts a fragile-to-strong crossover in <b>supercooled</b> <b>water’s</b> temperature-dependent relaxation processes.

5000|$|One of {{the most}} serious {{problems}} that plants face is ice crystal formation in the cells, which results in tissue death.

5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent <b>supercooled</b> <b>water</b> droplets are all about the same size.|$|E

500|$|Furthermore, the hailstone’s speed {{depends on}} its {{position}} in the cloud’s updraft and its mass. [...] This determines the varying thicknesses of the layers of the hailstone. [...] The accretion rate of <b>supercooled</b> <b>water</b> droplets onto the hailstone depends on the relative velocities between these water droplets and the hailstone itself. This means that generally the larger hailstones will form some distance from the stronger updraft where they can pass more time growing. [...] As the hailstone grows it releases latent heat, which keeps its exterior in a liquid phase. Because it undergoes 'wet growth', the outer layer is sticky (i.e. more adhesive), so a single hailstone may grow by collision with other smaller hailstones, forming a larger entity with an irregular shape.|$|E
