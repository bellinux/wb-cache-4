30|$|To remain {{or become}} {{globally}} competitive, many countries have developed strategic national science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) policy frameworks. STEM-strong countries are diverse economically, politically, and socially. Their STEM policy frameworks include {{a variety of}} services and activities designed to address factors affecting underrepresented minority students’ interest, motivation, and skills in STEM (Hulme and De Wilde 2014). A common feature shared among these initiatives is an emphasis on making STEM more engaging, practical, and student-centered. The ultimate goal of these programs is to diversity the STEM profession by attracting historically underrepresented minorities (women, indigenous/ethnic/cultural groups) and sustain their persistence in <b>STEM</b> fields (<b>Christie</b> et al. 2017).|$|R
30|$|Cementless {{fixation}} {{has evolved}} {{to be the}} predominant technique in femoral revisions. The commonly used stems include: (1) extensively-coated cylindrical design; (2) proximally-coated cylindrical or anatomically-shaped designs; and (3) modular designs {{with a variety of}} combinations of proximal and/or distal fit. Most techniques require rigid fit in the femoral diaphysis. Paprosky et al. [4] reported their experience in 170 extensively porous-coated stems. These THAs were followed for a mean of 13  years. Overall stem survival at 15  years was 95 %. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated bony-stable stem fixation in 82 %, and fibrous-stable fixation in 14 % of the hips. Six femoral stems were re-revised due to loosening. Similar clinical efficacy and fixation durability have also been reported with modular <b>stem</b> designs. <b>Christie</b> et al. [5] reported on 129 revisions using the S-ROM stem (DePuy a Johnson & Johnson Company. Warsaw, IN). The mean follow-up was 6.2  years. Overall stem survival at 10  years was 98 %. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated bony-stable fixation of the stems in 92 %. Clinical efficacy was reflected in an increase of the Harris hip score from 47 (preoperative) to 87 (final follow-up). One femoral component underwent re-revision for mechanical loosening. Kwong et al. [6] reported on the short-term results of using the Link modular tapered stem (Waldemar Link GmbH & Co, Hamburg, Germany) in 143 revision THAs. The overall stem survival rate was 97 % at 5  years. Moreover, the mean Harris hip score at final follow-up was 92. A total of 4 femoral stems underwent re-revision, one for infection, one due to surgical error, and 2 due to mechanical component failure.|$|R

5000|$|Austrian ski guide Hannes Schneider {{developed}} the <b>stem</b> <b>christie.</b> Having perfected it by 1910 he promoted {{it as the}} mainstay of the Arlberg technique, which he called the [...] "Alpine System". It replaced the Telemark turn as the standard for descending on skis. The technique was widely used up until the late 1960s, when its use diminished {{in favor of the}} parallel turn. Skis with increasingly [...] "parabolic sidecut" [...] accelerated the obsolescence of the <b>stem</b> <b>Christie,</b> starting in the late 1990s, because of their improved turning characteristics over skis with minimal sidecut.|$|E

5000|$|... {{the stem}} or <b>stem</b> <b>Christie</b> turn is similar, but the skis are kept {{parallel}} {{when they are}} not being turned, and the ski {{on the outside of the}} turn is pushed away from the body to initiate the turn (stemming). This is sometimes known as the [...] "wedge Christie".|$|E
5000|$|Steuri {{also worked}} as a ski instructor. He {{instructed}} Hermann and Othmar Gurtner and Walter Amstutz in alpine driving technique and the [...] "classic" [...] snowplough turns Telemark, <b>stem</b> <b>Christie</b> and stem turn. In 1926 Steuri {{was president of the}} Grindelwald ski club. He gave ski lessons into the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|The {{parallel}} turn in alpine {{skiing is}} a method for turning which rolls the ski onto one edge, allowing it to bend into an arc. Thus bent, the ski follows the turn without sliding. It contrasts with earlier techniques such as the <b>stem</b> <b>Christie,</b> which slides the ski outward from the body ("stemming") to generate sideways force. Parallel turns generate much less friction and are more efficient both in maintaining speed and minimizing skier effort.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>stem</b> <b>christie</b> or [...] "wedge christie" [...] is a {{technique}} used in skiing for turning. The turn comprises three steps: 1. Forming a wedge by rotating the tail of one ski outwards {{at an angle to}} the direction of movement, which initiates a change in direction opposite to the stemmed ski. 2. Bringing the other ski parallel to the wedged ski. 3. Completing the turn with both skis parallel as they carve an arcing turn sliding sideways together.|$|E
50|$|A carve turn is a skiing term, used {{to refer}} to a turning {{technique}} in which the ski shifts to {{one side or the other}} on its edges. When edged, the sidecut geometry causes the ski to bend into an arc, and the ski naturally follows this arc shape to produce a turning motion. The carve is very efficient and allows the skier to maintain their speed, unlike older techniques like the <b>stem</b> <b>Christie</b> and parallel turns based on stemming which can create significant drag.|$|E
50|$|In 1939, Dick Durrance {{ordered a}} custom ski from Thor Groswold's factory in Denver with a 7 mm sidecut, and this became a new {{standard}} for slalom skis. During the winter of 1948/49, Jerry Hiatt and Thor's son Jerry decided to experiment with even bigger sidecuts. Taking a pair of the company's standard hickory Rocket skis, they cut away wood until they produced a 15 mm sidecut. When they tried them out, they found they turned quite easily {{in a series of}} rounded turns. But this was considered poor form in the era of the <b>stem</b> <b>Christie,</b> where good form was a series of sharp J-shaped turns, and the two abandoned the design.|$|E
