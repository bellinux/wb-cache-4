5|$|After the DPP {{nominated}} Hsu as the 2001 Tainan mayoral race candidate, protests led by {{supporters of}} then-incumbent mayor George Chang, {{who is also}} a member of the DPP, arose. The protesters called Hsu a betrayer of the party as he left the party in 1995. They <b>showed</b> <b>their</b> disapproval of the party's choice by burning their party membership cards.|$|E

5|$|Barcelona {{kicked the}} match off, but Manchester United <b>showed</b> <b>their</b> intent from the outset, forcing goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to concede a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further {{pressure}} on the attack resulted in Yaya Touré fouling Anderson within Cristiano Ronaldo's shooting range. Ronaldo fired the free kick directly at Valdés, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and Gerard Piqué did well to divert Park Ji-sung's follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting corner was cleared, but {{only as far as}} Wayne Rooney, whose snap-shot was wayward and went out for a goal kick.|$|E
5|$|Building for the 1984–85 campaign, Bremner signed former Leeds striker Aiden Butterworth and winger John Buckley (£25,000 from Partick Thistle). Doncaster {{won five}} of their opening seven games, {{and though they}} were unable to sustain a {{promotion}} push they <b>showed</b> <b>their</b> ability with a 1–0 win over eventual champions Bradford at Valley Parade on Boxing Day and a 1–0 FA Cup win over First Division side Queens Park Rangers on 5 January. Rovers finished the season in 14th place, some distance from the promotion and the relegation places.|$|E
5|$|During the heats, the Australian team of Brooks, Fasala, Delany and Stockwell <b>showed</b> <b>their</b> {{intention}} {{to deny the}} Americans the gold {{for the first time}} at Olympic level. Drawn alongside the Americans in the third and final heat, the Australians set a new Olympic record of 3m 19.94s. Brooks led off in the heat, setting a time of 50.36s, before Stockwell made up a deficit of 0.41s during the anchor leg to beat the hosts by 0.20s. Australia and the United States had stamped their authority on the event, qualifying almost four seconds faster than third-placed Sweden. However, the Americans had more speed in reserve, having rested 200m freestyle silver medalist Mike Heath and 100m freestyle gold medallist Rowdy Gaines, whereas Australia used its full-strength team.|$|E

5|$|Writing for American Humor, {{academic}} Robert G. Pielke {{observed that}} the sketch was a very well-done, and moving, reflection on NBC management's fealty to Nielsen ratings and profit. Pielke went on to analyze the sketch and characterized it {{as an example of}} Saturday Night Live resisting conformist authority. He commented that an injustice had been wrought by NBC the company, whereas the NBC executives who came to shut down Star Trek were simply pawns in the process. He posited that the U.S.S. Enterprise crew members were against cancelling the television program because their self-worth had become tied to it. Pielke noted that {{within the confines of the}} sketch's plot itself, as each crew member realized there was no option other than cancellation, they each <b>showed</b> <b>their</b> actual identity and humanity.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{exhibits}} {{included a}} {{science and technology}} exhibit by Great Britain, while Mexico and Peru focused on handicrafts, and Japan and India attempted to show both of these sides of their national cultures.

Other pavilions included one featuring Brazilian tea and coffee; a European Communities Pavilion from the then six countries of the European Economic Community; and a joint pavilion by those countries of Africa that had by then achieved independence. Sweden's exhibit included the story of the salvaging of a 17th-century man-of-war from Stockholm harbor, and San Marino's exhibit featured its postage stamps and pottery. Near the center of this was the DuPen Fountain featuring three sculptures by Seattle artist Everett DuPen.|$|E

5|$|However, the Rashtrakuta kings also patronized Hinduism's {{followers}} of the Shaiva, Vaishnava and Shakta faiths. Almost all of their inscriptions begin with an invocation to god Vishnu or god Shiva. The Sanjan inscriptions tell of King Amoghavarsha I sacrificing a finger from his left hand at the Lakshmi temple at Kolhapur to avert a calamity in his kingdom. King Dantidurga performed the Hiranyagarbha (horse sacrifice) and the Sanjan and Cambay plates of King Govinda IV mention Brahmins performing such rituals as Rajasuya, Vajapeya and Agnishtoma. An early copper plate grant of King Dantidurga (753) shows an image of god Shiva and the coins of his successor, King Krishna I (768), bear the legend Parama Maheshwara (another name for Shiva). The kings' titles such as Veeranarayana <b>showed</b> <b>their</b> Vaishnava leanings. Their flag had {{the sign of the}} Ganges and Yamuna rivers, perhaps copied from the Badami Chalukyas. The famous Kailasnatha temple at Ellora and other rock-cut caves attributed to them show that the Hinduism was flourishing. Their family deity was a goddess by name Latana (also known as Rashtrashyena, Manasa Vindyavasini) who took the form of a falcon to save the kingdom. They built temples with icons and ornamentation that satisfied the needs of different faiths. The temple at Salotgi was meant for {{followers of}} Shiva and Vishnu and the temple at Kargudri was meant for worshipers of Shiva, Vishnu and Bhaskara (Surya, the sun god).|$|E
5|$|Southampton {{returned}} to Britain {{within a few}} months of the battle, and Macnamara was appointed to command the 32-gun , initially on the Irish station. During his time there he captured the 10-gun French privateer Echange, and on 20 October 1799 came across a convoy of Spanish merchantmen escorted by five frigates and two brigs. Despite the enemy's numerical superiority Macnamara attacked and captured one of the frigates, but was forced to abandon his prize after the other Spanish frigates came to her defence. He also captured a merchant ship, and having taken her men off, burnt her. Cerberus sustained minor damage during the engagement, and had only four men wounded. The Admiralty <b>showed</b> <b>their</b> approval of Macnamara's actions by promoting his first lieutenant. Macnamara was then sent out to the West Indies, where he cruised off Jamaica and San Domingo until the Peace of Amiens. Cerberus was then paid off in February 1803, and Macnamara went ashore.|$|E
5|$|Thailand, which {{shared an}} 800-kilometer (500-mile) border with Kampuchea and has {{historically}} feared Vietnam's expansionism, demanded that Vietnam immediately remove its troops from Kampuchea so its people could elect a government free from foreign intervention. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore <b>showed</b> <b>their</b> support for Thailand's position. Furthermore, ASEAN viewed Vietnam’s invasion and subsequent occupation of Kampuchea, which received strong Soviet support, as an intolerable {{threat to the}} region’s security and stability. That view was shared by China, which {{went as far as}} accusing Vietnam of forcing Kampuchea into an Indochinese federation to serve as an outpost of Soviet global hegemony. The United States, which never maintained any form of diplomatic ties with the Khmer Rouge’s Democratic Kampuchea, showed strong support for the membership of their former enemy in the UN General Assembly, and echoed ASEAN's call for an immediate withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces from Kampuchea.|$|E

5|$|The {{second day}} started {{dramatically}} when Halcombe bowled {{from the opposite}} end and bowled the second over of the day, with Lonergan standing at square leg. His first ball was deemed to be legitimate but from then on there was a continuous call of no ball, for ten consecutive deliveries. Halcombe then substantially reduced his pace and completed the over after 18 balls. Although Bryant did not switch Halcombe {{to the other end}} in the first match, he did so on this occasion. Halcombe continued bowling and there were no further no ball calls. During the ten consecutive no balls, Lonergan had remained firm despite continuous heckling from a section of the crowd who <b>showed</b> <b>their</b> support of the bowler. Halcombe persevered and ended the innings with 3/61 from 20 overs. His action was much discussed, in particular his faster ball. The opening batsmen Rushforth and Atkinson played Halcombe in a diplomatic manner, making little effort to attack his bowling {{in the midst of the}} throwing calls.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara {{have been}} {{referred}} to as living fossils, which means they retain many basal characteristics from {{around the time of the}} squamate – rhynchocephalian split (220 MYA). However, taxonomic work on Sphenodontia has shown this group has undergone a variety of changes throughout the Mesozoic, and a March 2008 molecular study <b>showed</b> <b>their</b> rate of molecular evolution has been the fastest of any animal yet examined. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There was even a successful group of aquatic sphenodontians known as pleurosaurs, which differed markedly from living tuatara. Tuatara show cold weather adaptations that allow them to thrive on the islands of New Zealand; these adaptations may be unique to tuatara since their sphenodontian ancestors lived in the much warmer climates of the Mesozoic. For instance, Palaeopleurosaurus appears to have had a much shorter lifespan compared to the modern tuatara.|$|E
5|$|When all {{the ballots}} were counted, fewer than 2,000 votes {{separated}} Garfield and Hancock, the closest popular vote of any American presidential election before or since. The voters <b>showed</b> <b>their</b> {{interest in the}} election by turning out in record numbers; 78 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot, among largest percentages in American history. Each major party candidate earned just over 48 percent of the vote. Weaver won more than 3 percent, tripling the Greenback total of four years earlier. The other minor party candidates fared far worse, as Dow and Phelps earned 0.1 and 0.01 percent, respectively. The narrow victory carried over into the Congressional vote, as the Republicans won the House by a twelve-seat margin and the Senate was evenly divided. Garfield carried the crucial state of New York by 20,000 votes out of 1.1 million cast there. Other states were much closer; Hancock’s margin of victory in California was only 144 votes.|$|E

5|$|Martinengo {{had been}} ill {{for some time}} before his death and had left the music of San Marco in a fragile state. The choir had been {{neglected}} and the administration overlooked. When Monteverdi arrived to take up his post, his principal responsibility was to recruit, train, discipline and manage the musicians of San Marco (the capella), who amounted to about 30 singers and six instrumentalists; the numbers could be increased for major events. Among the recruits to the choir was Francesco Cavalli, who joined in 1616 {{at the age of}} 14; he was to remain connected with San Marco throughout his life, and was to develop a close association with Monteverdi. Monteverdi also sought to expand the repertory, including not only the traditional a cappella repertoire of Roman and Flemish composers, but also examples of the modern style which he favoured, including the use of continuo and other instruments. Apart from this he was of course expected to compose music for all the major feasts of the church. This included a new mass each year for Holy Cross Day and Christmas Eve, cantatas in honour of the Venetian Doge, and numerous other works (many of which are lost). Monteverdi was also free to obtain income by providing music for other Venetian churches and for other patrons, and was frequently commissioned to provide music for state banquets. The Procurators of San Marco, to whom Monteverdi was directly responsible, <b>showed</b> <b>their</b> satisfaction with his work in 1616 by raising his annual salary from 300 ducats to 400.|$|E
