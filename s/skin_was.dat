5|$|Despite {{not having}} a sting, the {{porcupine}} ray is capable of injuring humans with its many sharp thorns. It is reportedly bold and tolerant of being approached closely underwater. The tough, thorny skin of this ray, made into a form of leather called shagreen, had many historical uses. In particular, {{it was used to}} cover the hilts of various melee weapons, as its extremely rough texture prevented slippage during battle. For example, the Japanese deemed it the only species whose <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> acceptable for covering sword grips. The Malayans used it to cover shields. The <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> also used ornamentally, such as by the Chinese, who dyed it and ground down the thorns to yield a mottled pattern. The native inhabitants of Funafuti Atoll used dried portions of the ray's tail as a rasp-like tool.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} was eaten in the Scottish Islands from the Neolithic until the eighteenth century, and its {{thick layer of}} fat beneath the <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> used as a cure for sciatica.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{alternate}} outfits for Batman were revealed in August 2011, including suit designs {{worn by the}} character in The Dark Knight Returns, , the Bronze Age of Comics, , and Batman Beyond. The Batman: The Animated Series <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> initially only available to GameStop customers in the U.S. with a Power-Up Rewards Membership. A PlayStation 3-exclusive Sinestro Corps outfit was revealed in August 2011 that initially was only unlockable via a unique code obtained by purchasing the extended cut edition of the Warner Bros. film, Green Lantern on Blu-ray Disc.|$|E
50|$|The <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> baggy {{and loose}} giving the {{impression}} {{that it is too}} big for the animal. The <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> covered with small rough adjacent scales. The <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> also used in the tannery industry.|$|R
25|$|Dark <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> a {{naturally}} occurring human <b>skin</b> color that <b>is</b> rich in eumelanin pigments {{and having a}} dark color. People with relatively dark <b>skin</b> <b>are</b> referred to as brown, and those with very dark <b>skin</b> <b>are</b> {{often referred to as}} black, although this usage can be ambiguous in some countries where it is also used to specifically refer to different ethnic groups or populations.|$|R
50|$|Open <b>skinning</b> <b>is</b> {{a method}} where the <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> {{removed from the}} animal like a jacket. This method is {{generally}} used if the <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> going to be tanned immediately or frozen for storage. A skin removed by the open method {{can be used for}} wall hangings or rugs. Larger animals <b>are</b> often <b>skinned</b> using the open method.|$|R
5|$|Designed by {{visual effects}} artist Phil Tippett, Jabba the Hutt was {{inspired}} by the anatomy of several animal species. His body structure and reproductive processes were based on annelid worms, hairless animals that have no skeleton and are hermaphroditic. Jabba's head was modeled after that of a snake, complete with bulbous, slit-pupilled eyes and a mouth that opens wide enough to swallow large prey. His <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> given moist, amphibian qualities. Jabba's design would come to represent almost all members of the Hutt species in subsequent Star Wars fiction.|$|E
5|$|Several {{copies of}} his death mask were made and a replica of one is still held at Moyse's Hall Museum. Artefacts from the trial, {{some of which were}} in Corder's possession, are also held at the museum. Another replica death mask is kept in the dungeons of Norwich Castle. Corder's <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> tanned by surgeon George Creed and used to bind an account of the murder.|$|E
5|$|Taraborrelli {{stated that}} Jackson was {{diagnosed}} with lupus, that the vitiligo partially lightened his skin, and the lupus was in remission, and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight, which could have caused his lupus condition to recur. Jackson's autopsy did not confirm or refute the claim that he had lupus, but it did confirm that he had vitiligo. His <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> found to have reduced (though not absent) melanocytes, the cells active in skin pigmentation.|$|E
25|$|Groups {{of nerve}} {{terminals}} {{located in the}} different layers of the <b>skin</b> <b>are</b> categorized {{depending on whether the}} <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> hairy, nonhairy, or an exposed mucous membrane.|$|R
5000|$|Flaying, {{also known}} colloquially as <b>skinning,</b> <b>was</b> {{a method of}} slow and painful {{execution}} in which <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> removed from the body. Generally, an attempt is made to keep the removed portion of skin intact.|$|R
50|$|Shark <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> {{another example}} of antifouling, {{self-cleaning}} and low adhesion surfaces. This hydrophilic surface allows sharks to maneuvers fast in water. Shark <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> composed of periodically arranged diamond-shape dermal denticles, superimposed with triangular riblets.|$|R
5|$|Tesla {{noted the}} hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early {{investigation}} of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated {{in contact with the}} skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.|$|E
5|$|The Comet's thin metal <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> {{composed}} of advanced new alloys and was both riveted and chemically bonded, which saved weight {{and reduced the}} risk of fatigue cracks spreading from the rivets. The chemical bonding process was accomplished using a new adhesive, Redux, which was liberally used {{in the construction of}} the wings and the fuselage of the Comet; it also had the advantage of simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|The Magyars buried their dead, {{laying the}} {{deceased}} {{on their backs}} with the arms resting along their bodies or upon their pelvises. A deceased warrior's tomb always contained material connected with his horse. These are most frequently its skin, skull, and the lower legs; these were put into its master's grave, but occasionally only the harness was buried together with the warrior, or the horse's <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> stuffed with hay. The Magyars rolled the corpses in textiles or mats and placed silver plates on the eyes and the mouth.|$|E
50|$|A {{little over}} 90,000 tonnes of hides and <b>skins</b> <b>are</b> {{exported}} {{every year to}} Ethiopia, Turkey, Pakistan, India, China and Italy. Raw camel hides and sheep and goat <b>skin</b> <b>are</b> also dispatched to the United Arab Emirates.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Horned puffins on a Nunivak Island sea cliff, August 2008. Horned puffin <b>skins</b> <b>were</b> {{counted and}} sold in [...] "knots" [...] or bundles of six. Thirty-four <b>skins</b> <b>were</b> {{necessary}} for a man's parka and 28 for a woman's.|$|R
25|$|Oily <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> {{caused by}} over-active sebaceous glands, that produce a {{substance}} called sebum, a naturally healthy skin lubricant. When the skin produces excessive sebum, it becomes heavy and thick in texture. Oily <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> typified by shininess, blemishes and pimples. The oily-skin type {{is not necessarily}} bad, since such <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> less prone to wrinkling, or other signs of aging, because the oil helps to keep needed moisture locked into the epidermis (outermost layer of skin).|$|R
5|$|Toads {{have a more}} {{sinister}} reputation. It was believed in European folklore that they were associated with witches as their familiar spirits and had magical powers. The toxic secretions from their <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> used in brewing evil potions, but was also put to use to create magical cures for human and livestock ailments. They {{were associated with the}} devil; in John Milton's Paradise Lost, Satan was depicted as a toad pouring poison into Eve's ear.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egypt venerated the lioness (the fierce hunter) {{as their}} war deities and {{among those in}} the Egyptian pantheon are, Bast, Mafdet, Menhit, Pakhet, Sekhmet, Tefnut, and the Sphinx; The lion was a {{prominent}} symbol in ancient Mesopotamia (from Sumer up to Assyrian and Babylonian times), where it was strongly associated with kingship. The classic Babylonian lion motif, found as a statue, carved or painted on walls, {{is often referred to}} as the striding lion of Babylon. The Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal is a famous sequence of Assyrian palace reliefs from c. 640 BC, now in the British Museum. The Nemean lion was symbolic in Ancient Greece and Rome, represented as the constellation and zodiac sign Leo, and described in mythology, where its <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> borne by the hero Heracles.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} other AJ-2 was {{purchased}} and used as a water bomber before it was purchased in 1970 by Avco Lycoming for use as an engine testbed for the YF102 turbofan. The J33 turbojet had to be reinstalled and the aircraft required almost a year of maintenance {{before it could be}} flown to Avco Lycoming's home airfield at Stratford, Connecticut. The YF102, too fat to fully fit in the bomb bay, was mounted on a retractable mechanism that could be lowered below the aircraft for tests. The testing was conducted from January to July 1972. Another round of testing on the commercial derivative of the F102, the ALF 502, was performed between January 1979 and December 1980. In 1984, routine maintenance discovered several loose rivets on the spar and further examination showed that the <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> starting to separate from the spar. This damage was too uneconomical to repair so Avco Lycoming decided to donate the last surviving Savage to the National Museum of Naval Aviation. The AJ-2 was flown to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida on 9 May 1984.|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} focused on moso bamboo shoot skins (Phyllostachys pubescens), which have been {{traditionally}} used for packaging food. For example, bamboo shoot <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> used as a preservative container to maintain the quality of tea leaves in China and {{has been used to}} wrap rice balls and meats in Japan. Fukuoka prefecture is the major cultivation area of bamboo shoots in Japan. A lot of food and food ingredients are produced from bamboo shoots, and bamboo shoot <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> a large by product of food processing. These <b>skins</b> <b>are</b> often composted, but they decompose slowly, so most bamboo shoot <b>skins</b> <b>are</b> burned. It is essential to utilize bamboo shoot skins efficiently.|$|R

50|$|Dr Norman Orentreich {{holds that}} human <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> {{intuitively}} capable of renewing itself, although this capability weakens {{with the passage}} of age and environmental conditions. He believes that great <b>skin</b> can <b>be</b> created if the secrets of the natural <b>skin</b> development <b>are</b> unlocked.|$|R
5|$|Between {{the forward}} and rear {{bulkhead}} was the bomb bay, which was constructed with a double-frame to strengthen it for carrying the bomb load. The {{space between the}} bomb bay and rear bulkhead was used up by Funkgerät radio equipment and contained the dorsal and flexible casemate ventral gunner positions. The rear bulkhead contained a hatch which allowed access {{into the rest of}} the fuselage which was held together by a series of stringers. The wing was a two spar design. The fuselage was formed of stringers to which the fuselage <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> riveted. Internally the frames were fixed only to the stringers, which made for simpler construction at the cost of some rigidity.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} success of the fund drive, the {{pedestal}} was not completed until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel's iron framework was anchored to steel I-beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled. Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached. Due to the width of the pedestal, {{it was not possible to}} erect scaffolding, and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections. Nevertheless, no one died during the construction. Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch's balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships' pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch—which was covered with gold leaf—and placed the lights inside them. A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs. After the <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> completed, renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, co-designer of New York's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park, supervised a cleanup of Bedloe's Island in anticipation of the dedication.|$|E
5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
50|$|When the <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> {{exposed to}} UV-B light, {{cholesterol}} in the <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> transformed into vitamin D3. In general the skin {{does not need}} much UV-B energy to generate vitamin D3, and 15 minutes of strong sunshine every day is usually considered enough.|$|R
25|$|When rosé wine is {{the primary}} product, it is {{produced}} with the skin contact method. Black-skinned grapes are crushed and the <b>skins</b> <b>are</b> allowed to remain {{in contact with the}} juice for a short period, typically one to three days. The must is then pressed, and the <b>skins</b> <b>are</b> discarded rather than left in contact throughout fermentation (as with red wine making). The longer that the <b>skins</b> <b>are</b> left in contact with the juice, the more intense the color of the final wine.|$|R
50|$|In the {{traditional}} facelift, an incision {{is made in}} front of the ear extending up into the hairline. The incision curves around the bottom of the ear and then behind it, usually ending near the hairline {{on the back of the}} neck. After the <b>skin</b> incision <b>is</b> made, the <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> separated from the deeper tissues with a scalpel or scissors (also called undermining) over the cheeks and neck. At this point, the deeper tissues (SMAS, the fascial suspension system of the face) can be tightened with sutures, with or without removing some of the excess deeper tissues. The <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> then redraped, and the amount of excess <b>skin</b> to <b>be</b> removed is determined by the surgeon's judgement and experience. The excess <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> then removed, and the <b>skin</b> incisions <b>are</b> closed with sutures and staples.|$|R
5|$|Jackson's <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> a medium-brown color {{throughout}} his youth; however, {{starting in the}} mid 1980s, his skin gradually grew paler, which was partly due to vitiligo, but also widely considered {{to be due to}} skin bleaching and changing of his features to appear white. According to Jackson's biographer, J. Randy Taraborrelli, in 1984, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo, which Taraborrelli stated was sometimes considered by doctors to be a consequence of damage done by bleaching chemicals over the years. However, vitiligo is a rare non-contagious disease; the causes are not known, but a range of genetic, auto-immune, and environmental factors are suspected {{to play a role in}} this disease. Between 1% and 2% of the world population is considered to be affected. The depigmentation occurs in patches and affects all ethnic/racial groups equally.|$|E
5|$|Lighting and {{its effect}} on characters' <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> of {{particular}} importance to the Business Division 2 team, with a lot of work going into making sure shading and transparency fitted with each character's position in a scene in relation to its lighting. Previsualization was initially going to be done entirely in-house, but the team eventually decided to bring in The Third Floor, an external company specializing in previsualization. The Third Floor ended up handling around 40% of the work. The animation was also supposed to be handled in-house using the V-Ray software, but the team found it difficult to adapt the software to their needs. As Nozue wanted to use the experience and technology of Visual Works to create Kingsglaive, they decided to bring in experienced and dedicated outside help to handle V-Ray. This resulted in the cooperation with Digic Pictures, which included former staff from Square Enix's North American branch and were highly skilled in the creation of high-quality cutscenes. For procedural environmental elements such as falling rubble, they used the Houdini animation software.|$|E
5|$|One day at harvest time, {{according}} to William of Newburgh {{during the reign}} of King Stephen (1135–1154), the villagers of Woolpit discovered two children, a brother and sister, beside one of the wolf pits that gave the village its name. Their <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> green, they spoke an unknown language, and their clothing was unfamiliar. Ralph reports that the children were taken to the home of Richard de Calne. Ralph and William agree that the pair refused all food for several days until they came across some raw broad beans, which they consumed eagerly. The children gradually adapted to normal food and in time lost their green colour. The boy, who appeared to be the younger of the two, became sickly and died shortly after he and his sister were baptised.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skin</b> grafts <b>are</b> often {{employed}} after {{serious injuries}} {{when some of}} the body's <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> damaged. Surgical removal (excision or debridement) of the damaged <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> followed by <b>skin</b> grafting. The grafting serves two purposes: it can reduce the course of treatment needed (and time in the hospital), and it can improve the function and appearance of the area of the body which receives the skin graft.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{toughness}} and looseness {{of their}} <b>skin,</b> honey badgers <b>are</b> {{very difficult to}} kill with dogs. Their <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> hard to penetrate, and its looseness allows them to twist and turn on their attackers when held. The only safe grip on a honey badger is {{on the back of}} the neck. The <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> also tough enough to resist several machete blows. The only sure way of killing them quickly is through a blow to the skull with a club or a shot to the head with a gun, as their <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> almost impervious to arrows and spears.|$|R
