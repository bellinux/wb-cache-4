25|$|The {{relationship}} between Marlene and Naomi Olive worsened after {{the move to}} the United States, and their arguments began to erupt into domestic violence. Over time, Marlene Olive also developed resentment toward her father for siding with her mother in disputes and suspected him of informing police about her friends' drug activities. She shoplifted, stole her parents' credit cards, used and overdosed on drugs, ran away from home, and received stolen goods from burglaries committed by a boyfriend. <b>She</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> several friends about wanting to kill her parents and asked {{some of them to}} help, but the friends either did not take her seriously or decided not to get involved. At one point, she attempted to poison her mother herself by mixing large doses of prescription drugs into her mother's food, but the drugs made the food taste bitter, and Naomi refused to eat it.|$|E

25|$|Kanin {{longed to}} move to Los Angeles to get into {{pictures}} and her parents indulged her. Her father moved to California first to secure a job, then {{she and her mother}} packed everything and followed by train. Kanin spent her senior year at the University of Southern California where she became active in college radio. After graduating with a bachelor's degree, she wangled an interview with Sam Marx who thought she was much too young to hire; but her next interview was with story editor Bob Sparks at RKO who sent her to producer Al Lewis, who then hired her as a story editor at $75 a week. RKO released Lewis, but Sparks kept Fay on as scriptreader to write one-page summaries for $25 a week. Kanin proceeded to teach herself everything she could about the movie industry at RKO's expense. During the lunch hour, <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> anyone she happened to find – whether they were art directors, editors, or cinematographers.|$|E
500|$|A new visual for the song, {{directed}} by Sophia Peer, was shot on December 2 {{of that year}} in Franklin, Tennessee. Peer stated that she wanted the video to [...] "reflect" [...] the message she retained from the song—"you had to push yourself out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself". She began by brainstorming ideas for the visual, and <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Alexandra Young and the video's editor Winston Case, who suggested her the concept of breaking world records. Peer selected 30 records for the band to break, nonetheless, they reduced the number due to the short length of the video shoot. The records selected were picked to match [...] "different sections of the song" [...] and were based on other already-existent records.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{felt that}} {{recording}} an album without her group mates was [...] "liberating and therapeutic", {{coming into the}} studio and freely expressing her ideas with her collaborators. The dependency she developed with Destiny's Child, however, meant it was harder [...] "to be on [...] own creatively". As she wanted to grow as an artist Beyoncé contacted other artists {{with a view to}} forming a collaborative partnership. When the collective finished writing several songs, she printed copies of each and sent them to prospective guest artists. <b>She</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> them by phone for possible collaboration, eventually gaining their approval. Besides Jay-Z, Beyoncé was able to work with Jamaican artist Sean Paul, American rapper Missy Elliott, among others. In contrast, some artists sent copies of songs to Beyoncé, which were eventually produced. Additionally, Beyoncé also worked with Timbaland and Missy Elliott on a track titled [...] "Wrapped Around Me" [...] for the album. Eventually, however, for reasons unknown, the song failed to appear on the album.|$|E

500|$|Julianne Moore was Glatzer and Westmoreland's {{first choice}} for the lead role. Moore {{prepared}} for the role over four months, watching documentaries about Alzheimer's disease. She met with Elizabeth Gelfand Stearns, the head of Alzheimer's Association, and Mary Sano, the director of Alzheimer's disease research at Mount Sinai Hospital. Through Skype, <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> three women with early-onset Alzheimer's disease; she also visited {{a support group for}} women with Alzheimer's disease and a long-term care facility for Alzheimer's patients. She also undertook the cognitive testing used for diagnosing dementia with a neuropsychiatrist. Moore suggested Alec Baldwin to play Alice's husband, since they had previously worked together on the sitcom 30 Rock. Kate Bosworth was cast after she told Glatzer and Westmoreland [...] "how important and personal the subject matter was" [...] to her; she had family members with Alzheimer's disease and, after reading Genova's book, set out to become involved in the film adaptation.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the lines}} in the episode proved {{difficult}} for both fans and cast members to embrace. Fans did not readily accept that The Smoking Man was Mulder's father. Davis, who portrayed The Smoking Man, noted that fans {{did not believe the}} revelation because [...] "part of the mystique of it was that everybody had their own idea of what was going on." [...] The dialogue in the episode proved difficult for Anderson to present believably. She was troubled that her character was arguing against the existence of extraterrestrials, when in the previous episode her character had encountered an alien shipwreck. When <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Carter, she said that she did not [...] "know if [...] do this anymore" [...] because her character was arguing against information that had been confirmed in the first two parts of the episode. Carter explained that there must be conflict between Mulder and Scully for the show's [...] "believer versus skeptic" [...] dynamic to work properly.|$|E
500|$|The episode flashbacks to the {{previous}} developments of several storylines throughout the season, including the love triangle between Rick, Shane, and Lori. Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband's revelations, Lori was conflicted with several issues. [...] "All of that is going through Lori's mind. Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane. Her son {{was a part of}} it. They're all infected. Is her baby infected? We're out on the road, where is she going to give birth? What happens if the baby dies? What happens if she dies? All of these questions are going through her head. The thing that affects her most is that she played a role in Shane's death. She put those two men at odds, she whispered in Rick's ear and then <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Shane at the windmill. She realizes that this has been over her, and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane's death. So she can blame Rick for that, but she's horrified by her own culpability." ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{the diary}} of Valentina Chebotareva, a woman who nursed with Olga during World War I, Olga's [...] "golden Mitya" [...] was Dmitri Chakh-Bagov, a wounded soldier she cared for {{when she was a}} Red Cross nurse. Chebotareva wrote that Olga's love for him was [...] "pure, naive, without hope" [...] and that she tried to avoid {{revealing}} her feelings to the other nurses. <b>She</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him regularly on the telephone, was depressed when he left the hospital, and jumped about exuberantly when she received a message from him. Dmitri Chakh-Bagov adored Olga and talked of killing Rasputin for her if she only gave the word, because it was the duty of an officer to protect the imperial family even against their will. However, he also reportedly showed other officers the letters Olga had written to him when he was drunk. Another young man, Volodia Volkomski, appeared to have affection for her as well. [...] "(He) always has a smile or two for her", wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on December 16, 1916. Chebotareva also noted in her diary Olga's stated [...] "dreams of happiness: [...] "To get married, [...] always live in the countryside [...] winter and summer, [...] see only good people [...] no one official.” ...|$|E
500|$|The show {{began with}} a skit where a {{flamboyant}} master of ceremonies welcomed spectators to the Onyx Hotel. After this, he took an onyx and threw into the video screens, causing a virtual chandelier {{to fall into the}} floor. Spears briefly appeared in the screens, as her dancers descended to the stage. She entered standing on top of a small bus dressed in a black catsuit, where she performed [...] "Toxic". She descended to the stage for the breakdown and then performed [...] "Overprotected". She took a break to talk to the audience, before going into [...] "Boys", which featured the male dancers pushing her while she was standing in luggage carts. [...] "Showdown" [...] featured rainbow-colored lighting effects and was the last song of the first act. A video interlude followed featuring Spears and her friends outside a club. While she was leaving, she noticed a woman dressed in 1930s fashion. She followed her and the woman asked Spears to enter the [...] "Mystic Lounge". Spears reappeared wearing a frilly pink corset to perform [...] "...Baby One More Time". She performed [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] with a vintage microphone and joined by her background singers. Spears and her dancers performed [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy", which contained elements of Latin percussion. After this, <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the audience and usually referenced her wedding with childhood friend Jason Alexander. She also introduced her band before leaving the stage.|$|E

500|$|In {{the next}} section, {{there was a}} video {{interlude}} of Spears wearing a flowered-themed dress and entering the [...] "Mystic Garden". As the video ended, she appeared on-stage sitting at a leaf-covered piano. <b>She</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the audience before performing [...] "Everytime". Her dancers joined her to perform [...] "The Hook Up" [...] and a jungle inspired mix of [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U". The show continued with another video interlude featuring a spoof of paranormal-themed shows, [...] "The Onyx Zone", with the master of ceremonies doing a Rod Serling impression and introducing [...] "The Shadow Room". Spears reappeared sitting on a swing to perform [...] "Shadow". During the performance, Spears was lifted into the air above an M-shaped blue ribbon, with performers twirling in the fabric. The performance ended with Spears leaving the stage while the dancers performed to a ballet interlude in flesh colored costumes. The next section began with a video projection of two guards watching Spears in her room through security cameras. Spears appeared on a smaller stage wearing a white robe and performed [...] "Touch of My Hand" [...] in a transparent bathtub. During the performance, she took the robe off to reveal a nude body suit with crystals that resembled her [...] "Toxic" [...] music video outfit. She left the stage briefly to a wardrobe change and reappeared on the mini platform where she descended to the main stage on a pole, wearing pink lingerie and performed [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] on a bed {{with one of her}} male dancers. She then put on a white trench coat and performed [...] "Outrageous", the last song of the act.|$|E
2500|$|International film actress Natalie Portman joined FINCA as its [...] "Ambassador of Hope" [...] in 2003, {{following}} {{a meeting with}} Queen Rania. About the meeting, she explains, [...] "Because I'm Israeli and Queen Rania {{is probably the most}} high-profile Palestinian woman in the world, I had this dream of meeting with her and doing something that would promote peace and working together between Israeli and Palestinian women. <b>She</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me a lot about what she calls the 'hope gap' that exists between the one third of the world that has and the two thirds that do not. I wasn't even aware that two thirds of the world population are extremely poor, living on less than a dollar a day, and that 70 percent of those people are women and children. It's not something they teach you in school in the States". Since then, Portman has visited FINCA field projects in Mexico, Guatemala, Uganda, and Ecuador, and met with several members of Congress to argue for more government funding for microfinance ventures.|$|E
2500|$|In 1600, a {{woman named}} Maddalena Busetto of Valvasone made two {{depositions}} regarding the benandanti of Moruzzo village to Fra Francesco Cummo of Vicenza, the commissioner of the Inquisition in the dioceses of Aquileia and Concordia. Claiming {{that she wanted to}} unburden her conscience, Busetto informed the commissioner that she had visited [...] the village, where she met a friend whose child was injured. Seeking out the perpetrator of the injury, <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the old woman she believed to be guilty, Pascutta Agrigolante, who claimed that she was a benandante and knew witches. Busetto did not know what the benandanti were, so enquired further, to which Agrigolante obliged by providing her an account of the nocturnal journeys. Agrigolante also named several other benandante who lived locally, including the village priest and {{a woman named}} Narda Peresut. Busetto proceeded to seek out Peresut, who admitted to being a benandante but who stated that she performed her healing magic in Gao to avoid prosecution from the Inquisition. Busetto would inform the commissioner that she did not believe any of these claims, but while he agreed to investigate further, {{there is no evidence that}} he ever did. That same year, a self-professed benandante named Bastian Petricci of Percoto was also denounced to the Holy Office, although it is not recorded that they took any action on the issue.|$|E
