40|$|Connectivity {{throughout}} {{the life cycle}} of flatfish remains an open question, especially during the early life stages. Their effective management requires understanding of how spawning grounds and nurseries are connected and what processes influence larval retention and dispersal. The case of sole (Solea solea L.) is of particular interest because {{it is one of the}} most valuable commercial species in the North Sea, although stocks are chronically overexploited and variability in interannual recruitment is high. The transport of sole larvae from the spawning grounds to the nurseries is driven by hydrodynamic processes, but the final dispersal pattern and larval survival/abundance might be influenced by both behavioral and environmental factors. Therefore it is important to understand the relative impact of hydrodynamics, environment, behavior and ecophysiology on sole larval dispersal. Here we use a particle-tracking transport model coupled to a 3 D hydro-dynamic model of the North Sea to investigate interannual variability of the transport of sole larvae over a 12 -year period (1995 - 2006). A sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the relative impact of hydrodynamics, temperature and behavior on the recruitment dynamics to the nurseries. Four scenarios have been tested: (i) constant forcing of sea surface temperature during all years but varying meteorological forcing and river runoff, (ii) constant meteorological forcing during the whole period but varying sea surface temperature and river runoff, (iii) no vertical migration and (iv) an extended drift period (max. 30 days) before settlement if the larvae are not close to a suitable sediment type. Results suggest that year-to-year variability of larval supply to the nurseries is high, both in terms of abundance and larval source (balance between retention and dispersal). Sensitivity analysis shows that larval abundance at the end of the larval stage increases considerably if a <b>settling</b> <b>delay</b> is included. The impact of vertical migration on larval transport and the variations in larval retention at the nurseries due to varying meteorological conditions and sea surface temperature forcing are not spatially consistent...|$|E

40|$|Congestive {{heart failure}} is a severe chronic disease often {{associated}} with disorders that alter the mechanisms of excitation-contraction coupling that may result in an asynchronous left ventricular motion which may further impair {{the ability of the}} failing heart to eject blood. In recent years a therapeutic approach to resynchronize the ventricles cardiac resynchronization therapy, CRT has been performed {{through the use of a}} pacemaker device able to provide atrial-based biventricular stimulation. Atrial lead senses the spontaneous occurrence of cells depolarization and sends the information to the generator which, in turn, after a <b>settled</b> <b>delay</b> atrioventricular AV delay, sends electrical impulses to both ventricles to stimulate their synchronous contraction. Recent studies performed on heart rate behavior of chronically implanted patients at different epochs after implantation have shown that CRT can lead to sustained overall improvement of heart function with a reduction in morbidity and mortality. At this moment, however, there are no studies about CRT effects on spontaneous heart activity of chronically implanted patients. We performed an experimental study in which the electrocardiographic signal of five subjects under chronic CRT was recorded during the activity of the pacemaker programmed at different AV delays and under spontaneous cardiac activity after pacemaker deactivation. The different behavior of heart rate variability during pacemaker activity and after pacemaker deactivation suggested the hypothesis of a phase resetting mechanism induced by the pacemaker stimulus on the sinoatrial SA node, a phenomenon already known in literature for aggregate of cardiac cells, but still unexplored in vivo. The constraints imposed by the nature of our study in vivo tests made it impossible to plan an experiment to prove our hypothesis directly. We therefore considered the best attainable result would be to prove the accordance of our data to the conjecture through the use of models and physical considerations. We first used the data of literature on far-field effects of cardiac defibrillators to prove that the pacemaker impulses delivered to the two ventricles were able to induce modifications in membrane voltage at the level of the SA node. To simulate a phase resetting mechanism of the SA node, we used a Van der Pol modified model to allow the possibility of changing the refractory period and the firing frequency of the cells separately. With appropriate parameters of the model we reproduced phase response curves that can account for our experimental data. Furthermore, the simulated curves closely resemble the functional form proposed in literature for perturbed aggregate of cardiac cells. Despite the small sample of subjects investigated and the limited number of ECG recordings at different AV delays, we think we have proved the plausibility of the proposed conjecture. © 2007 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

They were designed to investigate the effects of initial expansion (up to 50 vol. % above loose packing) and aspect ratio on the dynamics of flow propagation and deposition, and to explore different scalings {{in order to determine the}} physical parameters governing these processes. The flows exhibit a similar behaviour to other types of transient granular flows, including three well defined propagation phases (acceleration, constant velocity, and stopping phases) and the progressive aggradation of a basal static layer during emplacement. The deposit aggradation velocity depends only on the initial powder expansion and is similar to that of a collapsing bed of the same powder, expanded by the same amount, under quasi-static, non-shearing conditions. At a given initial expansion, the maximum runout distance scales with the initial bed height h 0, the runout duration with (h 0 /g) 1 / 2 and the maximum velocity with (gh 0) 1 / 2.

40|$|OV SAAL Zuidtak Oost {{is a large}} {{construction}} site where BAM Rail expands rail capacity from two to four railway tracks over 8 kilometre. In {{order to have a}} safe work environment, BAM Rail is allowed to possess the railway tracks for variable durations. For OV SAAL Zuidtak Oost a 9 day-rail possession is scheduled for the beginning of August 2016. For these nine days, at four different connected {{construction site}}s rail related construction works are executed. A strict and complex planning schedule is needed to guarantee all construction works can be completed before the deadline. In preparation for rail possessions, Gantt-charts and time-distance diagrams are used to create the planning schedules. Gantt-charts consist of a chain of linked activities representing the different tasks the construction site managers have to execute. Problem statement The planning methods that are currently used provide insufficient overview over complex TVPs (‘TreinVrije Perioden’). Only very experienced planners have the knowledge to make and interpret these planning schedules. Users identify three missing aspects resulting in failure costs and inefficiencies: 9 ̆ 5 The currently used planning methods show no spatial overview {{of the state of the}} complete line system at each moment of time. 9 ̆ 5 No clashes between different operational activities can be detected. 9 ̆ 5 Construction logistics (working trains, heavy machinery) cannot be represented with the current methods. BAM Rail experiences failure costs and expensive operational inefficiencies by the application of Gantt-charts and time-distance diagrams for general rail projects. Many users indicate that a spatial representation of a Gantt-chart would be useful in eliminating risks and inefficiencies. Therefore, the objective of this research is described as follows: To design a planning visualization method which assists BAM Rail in enhancing insight into the state of a linear construction site over time. Apart from the design of a planning visualization method, this research presents several additional recommendations related to observed processes during rail related construction works. Current situation User interviews and site visits were conducted to perform an in-depth analysis of the current situation. After categorizing the users’ responses, six main causes of risks and inefficiencies were identified: 1. Absence of clash detection: some clashing activities and invalid state sequences are left unidentified in the planning phase, resulting in failure costs during the construction phase. 2. High project complexity: Gantt-charts become too complex to comprehend, resulting in experts making mistakes when creating planning schedules. 3. Missing project overview: no basic site overview is available, resulting in non-expert decision makers making wrong decisions. 4. The impossibility to perform a scenario analysis: this results in failure costs as no control measures and fall back scenarios can be quantitatively analysed. 5. The impossibility to show construction logistics real-time: train paths and machinery locations are unknown, resulting in failure costs when making operational decisions. 6. The impossibility to determine delay propagations real-time: measures to <b>settle</b> <b>delayed</b> activities cannot be quantitatively analysed real-time, resulting in failure costs when making operational decisions. A requirements analysis presents a set of requirements for a visualization method. The complete set of requirements spans a solution space for a high-level design. High-level design Stakeholder interviews and test runs resulted in insights in the desired model output. The desired model output has been used to create a platform-independent high-level design. The high-level design consists of a model architecture, software architecture, pseudo code and system specification for use in the implementation in a software package. An important aspect of the high-level design is clash detection. Five different types of clashes are identified. For all five an automatic clash detection module is required. Activities moving in time are included in the high-level design as well. Implementation The suitability for implementation of the high-level design has been evaluated for two software packages, Navisworks and ArcGIS. The four main categories of evaluation criteria are defined as functional criteria, project management criteria, user interface criteria and configuration criteria. Preliminary tests with both software packages formed the basis for the evaluation. ArcGIS outperformed Navisworks in three out of four main criteria. After a sensitivity analysis, it was decided to create a prototype of the high-level design in ArcGIS. During the process of generating and validating the desired user output in ArcGIS, several shortcomings of ArcGIS were detected. These shortcomings were sorted based on the main functional aspects of the visualization model. Software developer Esri Nederland BV has been consulted to confirm the identified shortcomings and asked for strategies to overcome these limitations. Several recommended adjustments for ArcGIS are presented to Esri before a fully functional model can be implemented. Esri estimated that an investment of [...] - and [...] are necessary to deliver a fully functional visualization model, satisfying all user requirements. Research conclusions The conclusions of this research answer the main research question of this research: How can BAM Rail get insight into the state of the construction works at a line construction site at each time step? Firstly, it can be concluded that failure costs are associated with the identified risks and inefficiencies. Providing an adequate insight into the state of the construction site system at each time step reduces the planning related risks and thus the failure costs. It can be concluded that the state of the construction works can be represented best by several aspects: 1. For each planned activity the location must be presented in a geospatial overview. Both static and dynamic activities must be included. 2. For each user-defined track section the state of that section must be presented in the geospatial overview. 3. Time and infrastructure constraints must be included in the geospatial overview. It is concluded that a planning visualization method is necessary to get insights into the state of the construction works of a line system for each time step. A module to automatically detect clashes is necessary to assist users in detecting the identified types of clashes. The high-level design included how the model architecture and software architecture of a planning visualization model should look like. By implementing a software package with these characteristics and structure, insights into the state of a construction site system can be provided. Esri’s ArcGIS is found to be most suitable for the implementation. The possibility to present activities and states as polygons matches with the desired user output. Furthermore, CAD drawings and aerial photos facilitate an overview on scale. Finally, intuitive navigation through ArcGIS is considered as user-friendly. Concluding, creating a planning visualization model in ArcGIS results in satisfying the user requirements– from planner to site manager – and thus solve the six main causes of risks and inefficiencies. Recommendations BAM Rail is advised to request an official proposal from Esri for a visualization method in ArcGIS. In addition, a BAM project team leading the implementation in ArcGIS should be formed. This team is responsible for monitoring the progress and deadlines, organizing test runs and defining milestones and showstoppers. Additional recommendations are presented. First, two recommendations for BAM Rail are presented. Then, recommendations for further research are presented. It is observed that the communication between the coordinating construction site manager (BCU) and construction site managers (‘uitvoerder’) during the construction works is done only by phone, once every 2 - 4 hours. Users consider these phone calls as inefficient for regular operations. Therefore it is recommended to investigate the implementation of an integrated mobile system for site managers to report the progress using an application on a mobile phone or tablet. Furthermore, it is recommended that a more thorough workplace inspection is executed before a TVP starts. Currently, it often occurs that physical obstacles or deviating situations are only discovered during the construction phase, resulting in a wrong initial state. When these deviations are discovered in an early phase, failure costs can be prevented. This research presents a visualization algorithm rather than an optimization algorithm. It is recommended to investigate the possibility of implementing an optimization algorithm to not only visualize planners’ decisions, but also making them. Two aspects must be changed when designing an optimization algorithm. First, the addition of a probabilistic activity duration instead of a deterministic activity duration must be added. Second, expressing the starting time of each activity in completion time of prior activities must be added. Finally, it is recommended to research the possibility of implementing resources in the model. By considering available working crew, machinery or costs, the use of these materials can be viewed at each moment in time. Also for the extra resources constraints can be defined. Resources can be implemented in the clash detection model as well. Transport, Infrastructure and LogisticsTransport & PlanningTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R
40|$|The Baltic Sea {{is one of}} {{the most}} human-impacted sea areas in the world and its {{ecosystems}} are exposed to a variety of stressors of anthropogenic origin. Large changes in the environmental conditions, species and communities of the Baltic Sea are predicted to occur due to global climate change, but the extent and magnitude of the future changes are challenging to estimate due to the multiple stressors simultaneously impacting the system. As an additional threat, future ocean acidification will play a role in modifying the environmental conditions, and these CO 2 -induced changes are predicted to be fast in the Baltic Sea. This is especially of concern for the species-poor, but functionally essential benthic communities where key species such as bivalve Macoma balthica live at the limits of their tolerance range, and are already regularly disturbed by environmental stressors such as hypoxia. Currently, only very limited knowledge about the effects of future ocean acidification exists for this species. The overall aim of my thesis was to develop an understanding of the effects of CO 2 increase on the vulnerability of Baltic Sea key species, and how this is related to other effects of climate change, e. g. an increase in bottom-water hypoxia. Specifically, I investigated how different life stages of the infaunal bivalve M. balthica could be affected by future ocean acidification. Survival, growth, behaviour and physiological responses were assessed in a combination of laboratory and mesocosm experiments by exposing different life stages of M. balthica to different pH levels over different time periods depending on the life stage in question. While some life stage-based differences in vulnerability and survival were found, the results indicate that reduced pH has a negative effect on all life stages. In larval M. balthica, even a slight pH decrease was found to cause significant negative changes during that delicate life stage, both by slowing growth and by decreasing survival. Other observed impacts included <b>delayed</b> <b>settling</b> of the post-larvae and increasing energetic demand of adult bivalves. The results suggest consistent negative effects at all life stages with potential major implications for the resilience of M. Balthica populations, which are currently under threat from a range of anthropogenic stressors such as increasing hypoxia. The kind of experimental studies conducted in this thesis are useful for pinpointing mechanisms, but they are always simplifications of reality, however, and are usually conducted over time scales that are short in relation to the time scales over which ocean acidification is affecting populations, communities and ecosystems. To fully understand and to be able to estimate how the complex ecosystems are about to change in the future, incorporating more of the biotic interactions, impacting stressors and relevant environmental conditions are needed for increasing the level of realism in the experiments...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{properties}} of concentrated suspensions {{are of interest}} to many industries. Mineral slurries at higher solids concentrations have shown some rheologically interesting characteristics such as shear thickening, the increase of viscosity of a multi-phase mixture with increasing shear rate. The general literature on the rheology of suspensions records the presence of yield stresses, shear thinning and normal stress differences. Little is said specifically about shear thickening behaviour except for colloidal suspensions. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the behaviour of coarse shear thickening suspensions and determine the causes of this phenomenon. The study intended to achieve the following objectives to; develop the appropriate techniques for rheometric studies of shear thickening suspensions; investigate the nature of particle-fluid interaction; develop a model of shear thickening behaviour as it occurs in non-colloidal suspensions and to develop a method of applying the rheology results to flows and flow geometries of practical relevance. The effects of wall slip dominate much of the literature of shear thickening materials. To investigate this aspect a significant portion of the experimental work examined the effect of shear thickening on torsional flow. The rheogram produced from parallel plate rheometry was reassessed as a non-controlled flow and a rheology model dependant analysis demonstrated that the effects of slip are considerably more problematic for shear thickening suspensions, particularly as wall slip is an increasing function of shear stress. As a consequence of the rheometric method described above it was observed that the rate of change of the first normal stress difference, N 1, with shear rate changes as shear thickening commences for non-colloidal suspensions. N 1 is initially negative and is increasingly negative at low shear rates. Additional rheometric analysis examined the transient effects in the behaviour of a non-colloidal shear thickening suspension. By employing large angle oscillating strain tests the strain required to initiate a shear thickening response was determined. Coherent back scattering of laser light experiments were able to show the change in orientation of the particles with respect to its rotation around the vorticity axis. After a viscosity minimum was reached the orientation became more random as particle rotation and lamina disruption occurred. This was considered to be the cause of the measured shear thickening. A model of shear thickening in concentrated, non-colloidal suspensions of non-spherical particles was developed. Based on hydrodynamic interaction in the Stokes flow regime, the flow of interstitial fluid subjected the adjacent particles to lubricating and Couette type forces, acting as a couple. When a series of force balances on a particle contained between two moving laminae are conducted as a time sequence, the particle orientation and motion can be observed. The model has qualitative agreement with several aspects of the experimentally observed behaviour of shear thickening suspensions, such as viscosity change with shear rate and concentration, and the first normal stress difference increasing with shear rate. Pipe line flow experiments were conducted on the model suspension. Particle settling produces unusual patterns in shear thickening suspensions, with an annulus of <b>delayed</b> <b>settling</b> near the wall...|$|R
