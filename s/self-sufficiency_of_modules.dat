40|$|During {{the autumn}} of 2014 a project called Bobygget was initiated. The purpose of the project is to {{establish}} a future residential area in Herrljunga, where a sustainable and environmentally compatible lifestyle is fundamental. The purpose with this bachelor thesis was to, in consultation with Herrljunga Elektriska, investigate to what extent Bobygget could be self-sufficient from solar energy. Through PV systems at rooftops connected to a shared battery, a given ratio between produced energy and consumption in the area could be acquired. Calculations and simulations resulted in the required amount of bought energy for Bobygget as well as the potential sold energy to the grid. On account of a limited budget, this report was based on three different scenarios with different economic presumptions. The economic presumption for each scenario determined the capacity of the battery, which {{had an impact on the}} grade <b>of</b> yearly <b>self-sufficiency.</b> The first scenario resulted in a battery capacity of 63. 2 kWh which gave a <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> 27 %. In the second scenario the battery had a capacity of 328 kWh which resulted in a <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> 50 %. Since the third scenario had an unlimited budget, the capacity of the battery was determined by 100 % utilization of the produced energy. Therefore the battery acquired a capacity of 58 000 kWh which gave a <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> 79 %. Consequently, Bobygget could not be completely self-sufficient by installing PV systems at rooftops regardless of budget and capacity of the battery. To be able to accomplish a <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> 100 % an alternative solution is necessary...|$|R

This thesis {{focuses on the}} importance of home care agencies and their influence on the <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> the clients in the home environment. The aim is to find out to what extent the nurses of the home care agencies intervene to help clients achieve self-sufficiency. To reach the aim of my work and gather information, I prepared questionnaires for clients of home care agencies and for professional public. The theoretical part focuses mainly on the clarifying of the term "home care" and also the client and his or her self-sufficiency. The practical part is based upon the findings of the questionnaires completed by the nurses of the home care agencies and the clients. Hereby it is also possible to prove the hypothesis, whether the nurses test the <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> their home care clients, if they utilise compensatory aids for the clients and also if they involve {{the other members of the}} clients´ families to support the clients´ self-sufficiency. On the basis of available information resources and available literature, I attempted to carry out a current analysis of the environment. The obtained data are evaluated and presented in charts...|$|R

The permanent occupancy of space will be a major goal of the space systems development in the 1980 's with the following main phases: (1) achievement of easy access to earth orbit by means of the Shuttle and Spacelab; (2) achievement of permanent occupancy (Space Stations); (3) <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> man in space. New techniques of space operation will become possible, using much larger, complicated satellites and simplified ground stations. Orbital assembly of large stations, using a permanent base in orbit, will enable practical utilization of space systems for everyday needs. Particular attention is given to the space solar power concept, involving the location in space of large satellite systems. Results of the studies on Manned Orbital Systems Concept (MOSC) and some future possibilities of Space Stations are analyzed...|$|R
