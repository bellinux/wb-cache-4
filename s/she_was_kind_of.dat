[...] He added that the additional camera lenses used by director Jerry Finnerman in that episode for close-ups of her quivering lip only [...] "served to emphasize the lack of character written into the character."

500|$|In {{addition}} to gameplay, {{she was also}} one of the first characters to have her backstory fleshed out. In an interview with PC Gamer, the game's creative director, Chris Metzen stated, [...] "Tracer [...] one of the first characters we really got to know. And while she wasn't particularly created to be a starring role, if you will, we felt on the team, the more we got to know her and play her, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> like this Spider-Man type character for us. She's so rad, and it feels good to leverage her in the front of story ideas." [...] Tracer has also been noted for being a peppy character, with Hardcore Gamers Kevin Dunsmore describing her as a [...] "spunky Brit [...] full of little quips as she zips around the battlefield". Kaplan described [...] "Tracer [...] cute and playful, and she's the type of person who does everything with a wink and a smile." [...] In an interview with PCGamesN, game designer Michael Chu stated that [...] "the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people. She is incredibly optimistic, she is incredibly bubbly - it's part of her hero persona. We love her, I think she is very much one of the main characters of the game [...] really carry the torch of what the game is all about: heroism." [...] To reflect her English origin, Tracer is voiced by English actress Cara Theobold.|$|E
500|$|Bell {{said that}} at first Anna was written plainer and more general. [...] "In {{the first draft of}} the script she was written more, in my opinion, prissy. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{specific}} and very girly," [...] which Bell didn't find appealing. She admitted that she had always {{wanted to be part of}} Disney animated feature, but she [...] "wanted to be a very specific type of princess", who [...] "was way more awkward than the normal princesses", not someone with too good postures or too well-spoken. As she was offered the role of Anna, she came up with a lot of suggestions for the directors. They were responsive and allowed the actress to mould the character the way she wanted, since they wanted the film to be truthful. Bell significantly made specific changes to Anna, including the infusion and incorporation of the actress' own personality to the character, [...] embodying a relatable heroine, which received full support from the directors. She called the scene where Anna first meets Hans is a [...] "typical Disney moment", as they come too close physically and find out that they both fall in love with each other. Bell wanted Anna's words to reflect what she herself would say in real life, which included some [...] "nonsensical rambling". [...] "I think I said, [...] "This is awkward. You're not awkward. Me, I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait—what?" [...] Words just spill out of her mouth too quickly and she has to backtrack." [...] Bell continued. Or the whole scene where she wakes up in the beginning with saliva all over the face, Bell [...] "wanted her to also have hair in her mouth", which took inspiration from her own real life. [...] "Sometimes I wake up like that. Then you have hair in your mouth, and you start coughing. The animators totally got what I was trying to do. It's cool, and way more fun when stuff is realistic like that, instead of the perfection of waking up with mascara on." [...] Anna's snorting and tripping over also drew inspirations from Bell's real life. Bell's recording sessions were also videotaped to assist in animating the character, and animators took into considerations even subtle things like the actress' biting her lip a lot. According to director Jennifer Lee, Anna is a bit flawed.|$|E

2500|$|In 1917, France {{had been}} badly {{shaken by the}} Great Mutinies of the French Army {{in the spring of}} 1917 {{following}} the failure of the Nivelle Offensive together with a huge strike wave, and at the time, many believed that France might simply collapse as a result of war exhaustion. In July 1917, a new government under Georges Clemenceau, aka [...] "le tigre", had come into power, utterly committed to winning the war. In this context, having one German spy for whom everything that went wrong with the war so far could be blamed was most convenient for the French government, making Mata Hari the perfect scapegoat, which explains why the case against her received maximum publicity in the French press, and led to her importance in the war being greatly exaggerated. The Canadian historian Wesley Wark stated in a 2014 interview that Mata Hari was never an important spy and just made a scapegoat for French military failures which she had nothing to do with, stating: [...] "They needed a scapegoat and she was a notable target for scapegoating". Likewise, the British historian Julie Wheelwright stated: [...] "She really did not pass on anything that you couldn’t find in the local newspapers in Spain". Wheelwright went on to describe Zelle as [...] "...an independent woman, a divorcee, a citizen of a neutral country, a courtesan and a dancer, which made her a perfect scapegoat for the French, who were then losing the war. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> held up as an example of what might happen if your morals were too loose”.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{absolutely}} right. One glance at Miss Nugent {{told me that}} the poor old boy had got the correct idea. I hardly know how to describe the impression she made on me. On the way to the Pic, Archie had told me that what first attracted him to her was {{the fact that she was}} so utterly unlike Mabel Doughnut; but that had not prepared me for what she really was. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> intense, if you know what I mean--kind of spiritual. She was perfectly pleasant, and drew me out about golf and all that sort of thing; but all the time I felt that she considered me an earthy worm whose loftier soul-essence had been carelessly left out of his composition at birth. She made me wish that I had never seen a musical comedy or danced on a supper table on New Year's Eve. And if that was the impression she made on me, you can understand why poor old Archie jibbed at the idea of bringing her Funny Slices, and pointing at the Doughnuts and saying, [...] "Me--I did it!" [...] The notion {{was absolutely}} out of the question. The shot wasn't on the board. I told Archie so directly we were alone.|$|E

She couldn't breed, and that was all that she was good for. She was stolen from this place, this green place that she's trying to go back to. But <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> embedded in Citadel for one thing, and when she couldn't deliver on that one thing, she was discarded - and she didn't die.

5000|$|The {{final scene}} of Sarah {{on the balcony}} was added at the studio's behest, {{with a view to}} leaving the film {{open-ended}} and allowing for possible sequels. Sarandon later expressed regret that this sequence seemed to make no sense {{in the context of the}} rest of the film: [...] "The thing that made the film interesting to me was this question of, 'Would you want to live forever if you were an addict?' But as the film progressed, the powers that be rewrote the ending and decided that I wouldn't die, so what was the point? All the rules that we'd spent the entire film delineating, that Miriam lived forever and was indestructible, and all the people that she transformed eventually died, and that I killed myself rather than be an addict ignored. Suddenly I was kind of living, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> half dying... Nobody knew what was going on, and I thought that was a shame." ...|$|E

She wrote exquisite chants of lament in Hawaiian, craved Hawaiian food when she was away from it, loved to fish, hike, ride and camp out (activities she kept {{up to the end}} of her life) and, throughout her life, took very seriously her role as a protector of the people’s welfare. In a way, she was a harbinger of things to come in terms of Hawaii’s multi-ethnic, multi-cultural society. You have to be impressed with her eclecticism — spiritually, emotionally and physically. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> our first renaissance queen." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Anna Torv {{called the}} episode's hotel scene her {{favorite}} of the show so far, explaining [...] "I loved shooting that {{because it was the}} first time that Olivia really inched her way into that dynamic of Peter and Walter. <b>She’s</b> <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> on the outside, and wrangling them constantly, but this gave me a glimpse into realizing everything is a little bit entwined, and building more of that emotional conflict between them.

5000|$|Music critic Mark Deming {{has noted}} that lyrically, [...] "I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better" [...] takes a sardonic view of romance, with Clark {{undecided}} about whether to break off {{a relationship with a}} woman who hasn't been entirely honest with him. The song dates from The Byrds' pre-fame residency at Ciro's nightclub in Los Angeles, as Clark explained during an interview: [...] "There was a girlfriend I had known at the time, when we were playing at Ciro's. It was a weird time in my life because everything was changing so fast and I knew we were becoming popular. This girl was a funny girl, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a strange little girl and she started bothering me a lot. And I just wrote the song, 'I'm gonna feel a whole lot better when you're gone,' and that's all it was, but I wrote the whole song within a few minutes." ...|$|E
50|$|John Flynn later recalled:I quit {{about two-thirds}} of the way through, because {{producer}} Schiller kept interfering with the production, changing my camera set-ups, changing the wardrobe. Schiller is a very bright guy, but he drove me up the wall with his constant meddling, to the point where I literally had my hands around his neck one day. So I left and Schiller brought in Jack Arnold to finish the picture. I shot all the footage with Richard Basehart, Catherine Hicks and John Ireland, who was terrific as director John Huston.I cast this picture very carefully. Sheree North was outstanding as Marilyn’s crazy mother. Jocelyn Brando (Marlon’s sister) had a small part as Marilyn’s grandmother, and she made the most of it. Catherine Hicks was good, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> an imitation of Marilyn Monroe. I begged Bonnie Bedelia to take the part of Marilyn, but she turned it down. She was a great actress and an absolute knockout back then. I thought Bonnie would have been brilliant as Marilyn. Even Schiller agreed to cast her, but Bonnie wouldn’t do it.|$|E

Meyers 2007 Parsons biography Twenty Thousand Roads, [...] "Gram played us each of the songs that he had ready...We took it from there. It was loose as far as formal arranging was concerned - we played what we thought was right for the song, and it all seemed to fall together...He was in good shape, Gram. There was a lot of energy going on in the studio for the whole of that album. Gram was bouncing all over the place and Emmy was bouncing around him. They were great, happy sessions." [...] In the 2004 documentary Fallen Angel, however, manager Phil Kaufman claims Parsons was still drinking like he had been during the recording of GP, [...] "but not as bad.
