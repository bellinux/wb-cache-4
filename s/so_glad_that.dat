500|$|... "The Day We Died" [...] has {{generally}} received positive reviews from television critics. Sam McPherson from TV Overmind graded the finale with an A, writing [...] "From a show {{known for its}} mindbending episodes came the most mindbending episode of all. 'The Day We Died'... not only reinvigorated the show's fantastic (but inevitably aging) premise, but gave the show a breath of life that has me waiting -- no, begging -- for the show's fourth season." [...] Though he wouldn't call the finale the best Fringe episode yet, McPherson referred to the season as {{the best of the}} three and [...] "probably the best season of television that's aired in recent years". Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker lauded the finale, commenting in his review's conclusion [...] "Consider about the whole arc of this season and tell me this wasn’t one of the most moving, thrilling, funny, inspiring chunks of television you’ve watched. The performances by Noble, Torv, and Jackson were extraordinarily adroit, never showy or merely clever. I was <b>so</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that,</b> by season’s end, Jackson/Peter had once again taken center-stage — a central importance — to a season that, by the nature of its design, needed to concentrate a lot on Walter(s) and Olivia(s)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Generally, {{the album}} {{consists}} of urban contemporary gospel music containing elements of R, neo-soul and traditional black gospel music, with inspirational lyrics about building, maintaining and appreciating {{a relationship with}} God which also encourage the listener that [...] "everything {{is going to work}} out fine".
