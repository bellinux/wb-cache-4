50|$|Because the 30-year-old {{facilities}} were {{in need of}} renovation, in 2009 work started on replacing and partially converting the yard.

In the course of renovation a secondary hump with <b>shorter</b> <b>sorting</b> and formation sidings (Nachordnungsgleisen) will be given up in favour of longer sorting sidings for the formation of long-distance trains. Reception and sorting sidings and their associated points will be replaced in sets and the hump technology will be upgraded to the latest state of the art as part of the renovation work on the whole yard. A total of 220 million euros is being invested in this work which should be completed by 2014.|$|R

40|$|A {{wide range}} of applications, most notably in {{comparative}} genomics, involve the computation of a <b>shortest</b> <b>sorting</b> sequence of operations for a given permutation, where the set of allowed operations is fixed beforehand. Such sequences are useful for instance when reconstructing potential scenarios of evolution between species, or when trying to assess their similarity. We revisit those problems by adding a new constraint on the sequences to be computed: they must avoid a given set of forbidden intermediates, which correspond to species that cannot exist because the mutations that {{would be involved in}} their creation are lethal. We initiate this study by focusing on the case where the only mutations that can occur are exchanges of any two elements in the permutations, and give a polynomial time algorithm for solving that problem when the permutation to sort is an involution...|$|R

50|$|The {{deposits}} of pyroclastic falls follow a well sorted and well bedded trend. They exhibit mantle bedding—the deposits directly overlie pre-existing topography {{and maintain a}} uniform thickness over relatively <b>short</b> distances. <b>Sorting</b> by size is more pronounced than pyroclastic surge or pyroclastic flows. Early settling of crystals and lithic fragments near an eruptive vent and of glassy fragments further away is a common trend witnessed during many eruptions. The St Vincent eruption in 1902 ejected a large eruption column which when settled near the vent contained 73% crystals, and ash deposited in Jamaica 1,600 km away consisted entirely of glass dust.|$|R

40|$|To {{deal with}} the {{conflicts}} between left-turn and through traffic streams and increase the discharge capacity, this paper addresses the pre-signal which is implemented at a signalized intersection. Such an intersection with pre-signal is termed as a tandem intersection. For the tandem intersection, phase swap sorting strategy is deemed as the most effective phasing scheme in view of some exclusive merits, such as easier compliance of drivers, and <b>shorter</b> <b>sorting</b> area. However, a major limitation of the phase swap sorting strategy is not considered in previous studies: if one or more vehicle is left at the sorting area after the signal light turns to red, {{the capacity of the}} approach would be dramatically dropped. Besides, previous signal control studies deal with a fixed timing plan that is not adaptive with the fluctuation of traffic flows. Therefore, to cope with these two gaps, this paper firstly takes an in-depth analysis of the traffic flow operations at the tandem intersection. Secondly, three groups of loop detectors are placed to obtain the real-time vehicle information for adaptive signalization. The lane selection behavior in the sorting area is considered to set the green time for intersection signals. With the objective of minimizing the vehicle delay, the signal control parameters are then optimized based on a dynamic programming method. Finally, numerical experiments show that average vehicle delay and maximum queue length can be reduced under all scenarios...|$|R

The next moment there appeared in the doorway a short, stout young man. There was an indescribable air of toughness about him, partly due to the fact that he wore his hair in a well-oiled fringe almost down to his eyebrows, which gave him the appearance of having no forehead at all. His eyes were small and set close together. His mouth was wide, his jaw prominent. Not, in <b>short,</b> the <b>sort</b> of man you would have picked out on sight as a model citizen.|$|R
