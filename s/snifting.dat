5|$|Construction of {{the delayed}} 1926 order for 20 K class {{locomotives}} began in 1928 after alteration to the U class specification. As {{a result of}} Harold Holcroft’s position as one of Maunsell’s assistants, the new-builds also displayed the Churchward GWR 4300 Class influence. The ideas applied to this class were already used on the N, N1 and K class rebuilds, including long-travel valves for fast running, Belpaire firebox and conical boilers, constructed at the North British Locomotive Works in Glasgow. The first of the production batch emerged from Brighton works in August 1928 and featured a tapered chimney and smokebox <b>snifting</b> valves, {{both of which were}} used on the K and N class locomotives.|$|E
5|$|The second {{batch of}} ten new-build U class {{locomotives}} was constructed between February and May 1931 when more obsolete locomotives were withdrawn from service. This brought {{the total of}} new-build locomotives to 30, and {{the total number of}} operational U class engines to 50. The new batch also featured detail differences {{from the rest of the}} class, such as the arrangement of the footsteps at the front of the locomotive, though continued to use the standard left-hand drive cab layout to improve the driver’s forward vision from the cab. Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933 to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring forward vision. The smokebox <b>snifting</b> valves applied to the class by Maunsell were removed by his successor Oliver Bulleid, who also fitted U1 class chimneys to improve the draughting.|$|E
5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. <b>Snifting</b> valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E

The {{results of the investigation}} indicated an increase in the rate of change of pitching-moment coefficient with lift coefficient at a L) a-cmconstant Mach number-E ~ through the transonic range that was attributed to a rearward <b>snift</b> of the wing-fuselage aerodynamic-center location at subsonic speeds and to a rapid decrease in dowmwash at supersonic speeds. At a Mach number of about 0. 95 a moderate decrease occurred in both the lift-curve slope and in the stabilizer effectiveness. The high angle of sweep was effective in delaying the drag rise at zero angle of attack up to a Mach number of about 0. 95. The curve of stabilizer incidence required for trim against Mach number had an unstable variation between a Maoh number of 0. 90 and 1. 20, but trim could be maintained throughout the Mach number range with a stabilizer deflection of only slightly more than 1 °...|$|R
5|$|The last {{modification}} of the class undertaken by Maunsell was the gradual introduction of small smoke deflector plates from 1934. These were fitted to improve driver visibility {{as a result of}} smoke deflection experiments made on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927. Maunsell retired from the Southern Railway in 1937 and his replacement was Oliver Bulleid. Despite making various modifications to the steam circuit on other Maunsell classes, Bulleid saw no reason to make such drastic alterations to the N1class. As a result, the final set of modifications made under Southern Railway ownership was made after the Second World War and included the removal of superfluous smokebox-mounted anti-vacuum <b>snifting</b> valves and the replacement of the wide-diameter N1 chimney with the U1 type to improve draughting on the prototype; the standard Nclass chimneys of the other five were also replaced. The class was well-used by British Railways over both Central and Eastern sections between 1948 and 1962 and justified the fitting of Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1959 alongside the Nclass.|$|E
25|$|The entire U1 {{class had}} smokebox <b>snifting</b> valves, a feature {{previously}} {{used on the}} other Maunsell moguls. The main batch saw the front steps relocated ahead of the cylinders, as opposed to behind on the A890 rebuild, which was another relic of its previous guise as a 2-6-4 tank locomotive. Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933, as {{with most of the}} locomotives designed by Maunsell. The smokebox <b>snifting</b> valves were removed by Oliver Bulleid {{by the end of the}} Second World War, although the U1 class chimney was used to improve draughting on the other Maunsell moguls.|$|E
500|$|In 1937, Maunsell's {{replacement}} Oliver Bulleid saw no need {{to improve}} draughting of the class, and spared them from trials with Lemaître multiple-jet blastpipes and wide-diameter chimneys. However, he had Maunsell's smokebox-mounted anti-vacuum <b>snifting</b> valves removed {{at the end of}} the Second World War in an effort to reduce maintenance. Bulleid also had eight new [...] tenders built specially for the left-hand drive locomotives. In 1947, No.1831 was given electric lighting and converted to oil-burning as part of government-backed fuel trials in anticipation of a post-war coal shortage, though it was reverted to coal-firing in December 1948.|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{spoke to}} my lady the knight[2] full of care, [...] "Let me have your advice in a weighty affair. This Hamilton's bawn, while it sticks {{in my hand}} I lose by the house what I get by the land; But how to dispose {{of it to the}} best bidder, For a barrack[6] or malt-house, we now must consider. [...] "First, let me suppose I make it a malt-house, Here I have {{computed}} the profit will fall t'us: There's nine hundred pounds for labour and grain, I increase it to twelve, so three hundred remain; A handsome addition for wine and good cheer, Three dishes a-day, and three hogsheads a-year; With a dozen large vessels my vault shall be stored; No little scrub joint shall come on my board; And you and the Dean no more shall combine To stint me at night to one bottle of wine; Nor shall I, for his humour, permit you to purloin A stone and a quarter of beef from my sir-loin. If I make it a barrack, the crown is my tenant; My dear, I have ponder'd again and again on't: In poundage and drawbacks I lose half my rent, Whatever they give me, I must be content, Or join with the court in every debate; And rather than that, I would lose my estate." [...] Thus ended the knight; thus began his meek wife: [...] "It must, and it shall be a barrack, my life. I'm grown a mere mopus; no company comes But a rabble of tenants, and rusty dull rums.[5] With parsons what lady can keep herself clean? I'm all over daub'd when I sit by the Dean. But if you will give us a barrack, my dear, The captain I'm sure will always come here; I then shall not value his deanship a straw, For the captain, I warrant, will keep him in awe; Or, should he pretend to be brisk and alert, Will tell him that chaplains should not be so pert; That men of his coat should be minding their prayers, And not among ladies to give themselves airs." [...] Thus argued my lady, but argued in vain; The knight his opinion resolved to maintain. [...] But Hannah,[6] who listen'd to all that was past, And could not endure so vulgar a taste, As soon as her ladyship call'd to be dress'd, Cried, [...] "Madam, why surely my master's possess'd, Sir Arthur the maltster! how fine it will sound! I'd rather the bawn were sunk under ground.

Dear madam, whene'er of a barrack I think, An I were to be hang'd, I can't sleep a wink: For if a new crotchet comes into my brain, I can't get it out, though I'd never so fain. I fancy already a barrack contrived At Hamilton's bawn, and the troop is arrived; Of this to be sure, Sir Arthur has warning, And waits on the captain betimes the next morning. [...] "Now see, when they meet, how their honours behave; 'Noble captain, your servant'--'Sir Arthur, your slave; You honour me much'--'The honour is mine.'-- ''Twas a sad rainy night'--'But the morning is fine.'-- 'Pray, how does my lady?'--'My wife's at your service.'-- 'I think I have seen her picture by Jervas.'-- 'Good-morrow, good captain'--'I'll wait on you down'-- 'You shan't stir a foot'--'You'll think me a clown.'-- 'For all the world, captain, not half an inch farther'-- 'You must be obey'd--Your servant, Sir Arthur!

Now, madam, observe how he marches in state: The man with the kettle-drum enters the gate: Dub, dub, adub, dub. The trumpeters follow. Tantara, tantara; while all the boys holla. See now comes the captain all daub'd with gold lace: O la! the sweet gentleman! look in his face; And see how he rides like a lord of the land, With the fine flaming sword that he holds in his hand; And his horse, the dear creter, it prances and rears; With ribbons in knots at its tail and its ears: At last comes the troop, by word of command, Drawn up in our court; when the captain cries, STAND! Your ladyship lifts up the sash to be seen, For sure I had dizen'd you out like a queen. The captain, to show he is proud of the favour, Looks up to your window, and cocks up his beaver; (His beaver is cock'd: pray, madam, mark that, For a captain of horse never takes off his hat, Because he has never a hand that is idle, For the right holds the sword, and the left holds the bridle;) Then flourishes thrice his sword in the air, As a compliment due to a lady so fair; (How I tremble to think of the blood it has spilt!) Then he lowers down the point, and kisses the hilt. Your ladyship smiles, and thus you begin: 'Pray, captain, be pleased to alight and walk in.' The captain salutes you with congee profound, And your ladyship curtseys half way to the ground.

To shorten my tale, (for I hate a long story,) The captain at dinner appears in his glory; The dean and the doctor[8] have humbled their pride, For the captain's entreated to sit by your side; And, because he's their betters, you carve for him first; The parsons for envy are ready to burst. The servants, amazed, are scarce ever able To keep off their eyes, as they wait at the table; And Molly and I have thrust in our nose, To peep at the captain in all his fine clo'es.

500|$|Maunsell and Holcroft {{completed}} {{plans for}} a new 3-cylinder locomotive in 1919. Designated N1, the new design was an attempt to increase the operational flexibility and power of the SECR 2-6-0 without substantially increasing axle loading. Holcroft's previous employment as an engineer involved with the GWR's 4300class meant that the N1 used the same Churchward features as the Nclass to aid standardisation and the manufacture of parts. These included the use of long-travel valves for free running at speed, right-hand drive in the cab and [...] driving wheels. The retention of the 2-6-0 wheel arrangement meant ample accommodation for the Nclass' tapered boiler with Belpaire firebox. As with the Nclass, detail design on the N1 was left to another of Maunsell's assistants, James Clayton, who brought functional Midland Railway influences to the design: the loading gauge-friendly shape of the cab, the tender and the large-diameter smokebox. The smokebox housed a large superheater, regulator valve and <b>snifting</b> (anti-vacuum) valves. [...] The N1 also retained Walschaerts valve gear on both outside cylinders.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he's {{making a}} snuffling noise. Great {{difference}} between snuffling and <b>snifting.</b> Not {{the same thing}} at all. I mean to say, when they snift they snift, and when they snuffle they--as it were--snuffle. That's how you can tell. If you ask ME"--he passed his hand over the dog's back. Percy uttered another cry. [...] "I know what's the matter with him." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{probable}} {{explanation for}} this diversity is that <b>snifting</b> valves were useful as long as steam temperatures were relatively low. As locomotive development proceeded, larger superheaters were fitted and steam temperatures increased. When the locomotive was coasting, the air passing from the superheater to the cylinders became so hot that it oxidised the cylinder oil and interfered with lubrication. At this point, most railways decided to abandon <b>snifting</b> valves.|$|E
50|$|A <b>snifting</b> valve (sometimes snifter valve) is an {{automatic}} anti-vacuum valve {{used in a}} steam locomotive when coasting. The word Snift imitates the sound made by the valve.|$|E
50|$|With {{somewhat}} different functions, <b>snifting</b> valves {{were also used}} in atmospheric steam engines and hydraulic rams. They are not generally used in later stationary steam engines, road engines, or marine engines.|$|E

50|$|The steam {{passing through}} the {{superheater}} elements cools their metal and prevents them from melting, but when the throttle closes this cooling effect is absent, and thus a damper closes in the smokebox {{to cut off the}} flow through the flues and prevent them being damaged. Some locomotives (particularly on the London and North Eastern Railway) were fitted with <b>snifting</b> valves which admitted air to the superheater when the locomotive was coasting (drifting). This kept the superheater elements cool and the cylinders warm. The <b>snifting</b> valve can be seen behind the chimney on many LNER locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The entire U1 {{class had}} smokebox <b>snifting</b> valves, a feature {{previously}} {{used on the}} other Maunsell moguls. The main batch saw the front steps relocated ahead of the cylinders, as opposed to behind on the A890 rebuild, which was another relic of its previous guise as a 2-6-4 tank locomotive. Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933, as {{with most of the}} locomotives designed by Maunsell.

5000|$|<b>Snifting</b> valve (not shown) [...] - [...] An anti-vacuum valve which permits air to {{be drawn}} through the {{superheater}} and cylinders which allows the engine to coast freely when the regulator is closed.|$|E
5000|$|UK railway {{companies}} did {{not agree}} {{on the merits of}} <b>snifting</b> valves. The London and North Eastern Railway used them very widely. The Southern Railway used them for a while but later removed them.|$|E
50|$|The <b>snifting</b> valves may {{be mounted}} {{directly}} on the cylinders or steam chests. The drawback of this arrangement is that they admit cold air which cools the cylinders and leads to condensation when the steam is turned on again.|$|E
50|$|A {{pressure}} relief valve was fitted to the cylinder covers and <b>snifting</b> valves were fitted to the steam chests. Lubrication of the cylinders and piston valves was {{by means of a}} Ritter six-piston oil press, which was arranged in the cab at the right hand side of the engine and actuated from the trailing crank pin.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{superheater}} is fitted, {{one or two}} <b>snifting</b> valves may {{be mounted}} on the [...] "wet" [...] side of the superheater header. This causes air to be drawn through the superheater and heated so that it keeps the cylinders warm. Different railways had different ideas about the merits of drawing air through the superheater elements when coasting.|$|E
50|$|When {{the driver}} {{shuts off the}} steam to the {{cylinders}} of a steam locomotive while it is in motion, the moving pistons could create a partial vacuum in the cylinders. This would give rise to two problems. Firstly, the pumping action would absorb energy and prevent the engine from coasting freely. Secondly, when the exhaust valve opened, soot and cinders from the smokebox could be sucked down the exhaust pipe and into the valve chest or cylinder, causing damage. (The exhaust {{is open to the}} smokebox because in normal running the exhaust steam is sent through the blastpipe to draw the fire and eject the combustion products from the chimney.) These problems are avoided by using <b>snifting</b> valves to allow air to be drawn into the cylinder. On railways which did not use <b>snifting</b> valves, drivers were instructed to keep the regulator slightly open when coasting to avoid the creation of a vacuum.|$|E
50|$|Further similar {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} on Class 5B no. 726 in September 1931, Class 16B no. 805 in July 1932, Class 16DA no. 876 in August 1932, Class 15CA no. 2852 in March 1933 and finally on Class 15A no. 1961. The results of these extended tests did not prove entirely satisfactory and all these engines were gradually refitted with standard piston valves and <b>snifting</b> valves.|$|E
50|$|The {{first such}} {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} on Class 16C no. 851. Further similar experiments were carried out on Class 16B no. 805 in July 1932, Class 16DA no. 876 in August 1932, Class 15CA no. 2852 in March 1933 and finally on Class 15A no. 1961. The results of these extended tests did not prove entirely satisfactory and all these engines were gradually refitted with standard piston valves and <b>snifting</b> valves.|$|E
50|$|Other visible {{differences}} are larger mechanical lubricators and external {{drive from the}} valve spindle, a vacuum ejector exhaust muffler {{just in front of}} the safety valves, pipes conveying exhaust and ejector steam to the ashpan for mixing with the primary air, the secondary air inlets in the firebox sides with spark arresting plates outside them, and the <b>snifting</b> and bypass valves which were removed and blanked off since the modified locomotive drifted in mid-gear with steam supplied from the drifting valve.|$|E
50|$|In 1937, Maunsell's {{replacement}} Oliver Bulleid saw no need {{to improve}} draughting of the class, and spared them from trials with Lemaître multiple-jet blastpipes and wide-diameter chimneys. However, he had Maunsell's smokebox-mounted anti-vacuum <b>snifting</b> valves removed {{at the end of}} the Second World War in an effort to reduce maintenance. Bulleid also had eight new 4000 imp gal tenders built specially for the left-hand drive locomotives. In 1947, No. 1831 was given electric lighting and converted to oil-burning as part of government-backed fuel trials in anticipation of a post-war coal shortage, though it was reverted to coal-firing in December 1948.|$|E
50|$|There were {{originally}} eight cams for forward motion and three for reverse, which gave {{a range of}} cut-offs from 15% to 85% in forward gear. The hand reversing screw spindle carried a disk, suitably notched with a locking device {{to ensure that the}} cam rollers would be in the centre of the selected cams under working conditions. During drifting, the reversing gear is placed in the neutral position where the exhaust valves are held fully open. These conditions were ideal for drifting and superior to any Walschaerts valve gear in admitting steam to the steam chests, even with cylinders equipped with by-pass valves, <b>snifting</b> valves and drifting valves.|$|E
50|$|Construction of {{the delayed}} 1926 order for 20 K class {{locomotives}} began in 1928 after alteration to the U class specification. As {{a result of}} Harold Holcroft’s position as one of Maunsell’s assistants, the new-builds also displayed the Churchward GWR 4300 Class influence. The ideas applied to this class were already used on the N, N1 and K class rebuilds, including long-travel valves for fast running, Belpaire firebox and conical boilers, constructed at the North British Locomotive Works in Glasgow. The first of the production batch emerged from Brighton works in August 1928 and featured a tapered chimney and smokebox <b>snifting</b> valves, {{both of which were}} used on the K and N class locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The second {{batch of}} ten new-build U class {{locomotives}} was constructed between February and May 1931 when more obsolete locomotives were withdrawn from service. This brought {{the total of}} new-build locomotives to 30, and {{the total number of}} operational U class engines to 50. The new batch also featured detail differences {{from the rest of the}} class, such as the arrangement of the footsteps at the front of the locomotive, though continued to use the standard left-hand drive cab layout to improve the driver’s forward vision from the cab. Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933 to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring forward vision. The smokebox <b>snifting</b> valves applied to the class by Maunsell were removed by his successor Oliver Bulleid, who also fitted U1 class chimneys to improve the draughting.|$|E
5000|$|Newcomen {{found that}} his first engine would stop working after a while, and {{eventually}} discovered that {{this was due to}} small amounts of air being admitted to the cylinder with the steam. Water usually contains some dissolved air, and boiling the water released this with the steam. This air could not be condensed by the water spray and gradually accumulated until the engine became [...] "wind logged". To prevent this a release valve called a [...] "snifting clack" [...] or snifter valve was added {{near the bottom of the}} cylinder. This opened briefly when steam was first admitted to and non-condensable gas was driven from the cylinder. Its name was derived from the noise it made when it operated to release the air and steam [...] "like a Man <b>snifting</b> with a Cold".|$|E
50|$|First engines {{had large}} steam domes, open cabs and C16 style tenders. Those built from 1938 onwards, commencing with N°858, had small steam domes, sedan cabs with welded tenders and also larger {{diameter}} (9+1/2 in) piston valves. The {{two types of}} boilers were occasionally interchanged at overhauls and by later years most of the old style ones had been replaced. The last 40 engines, N°961 to N°1000, were fitted with Timken roller bearings and painted brown. They acquired the nickname of Brown Bombers after American boxer Joe Louis. Those overhauled {{in the last years}} of steam operations were repainted black. A number of modifications were carried out over their life including the fitting of large mushroom air <b>snifting</b> valves. Several had additional sandboxes and/or rear headlights fitted at various times for working lines where no turning facilities were available.|$|E
50|$|The Trofimoff {{piston valve}} {{consisted}} of two fixed discs secured to the valve spindle, and two junk rings, each carrying a bull ring and four valve rings and both free to move longitudinally on the spindle. When the regulator is opened, steam forces the loose valve bodies against their respective fixed discs and they then act as units, similar to ordinary piston valves. When steam is shut off, the loose valve heads become detached from their respective discs and remain in their idle positions near {{the centre of the}} steam chest, while the valve spindle and fixed disks continue their reciprocating motion with the spindle sliding freely through the now stationary loose valve heads, and with the steam and exhaust ports now in communi&shy;ca&shy;tion. With both ends of the cylinders now in communication, the use of ordinary by-bass or <b>snifting</b> valves became unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. <b>Snifting</b> valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E
50|$|The last {{modification}} of the class undertaken by Maunsell was the gradual introduction of small smoke deflector plates from 1934. These were fitted to improve driver visibility {{as a result of}} smoke deflection experiments made on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927. Maunsell retired from the Southern Railway in 1937 and his replacement was Oliver Bulleid. Despite making various modifications to the steam circuit on other Maunsell classes, Bulleid saw no reason to make such drastic alterations to the N1 class. As a result, the final set of modifications made under Southern Railway ownership was made after the Second World War and included the removal of superfluous smokebox-mounted anti-vacuum <b>snifting</b> valves and the replacement of the wide-diameter N1 chimney with the U1 type to improve draughting on the prototype; the standard N class chimneys of the other five were also replaced. The class was well-used by British Railways over both Central and Eastern sections between 1948 and 1962 and justified the fitting of Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1959 alongside the N class.|$|E
