2500|$|Tynan's first {{marriage}} deteriorated {{to the point}} where he was living apart from Dundy, and they finally divorced in May 1964. In December 1962, he had met Kathleen Halton, the daughter of wartime CBC correspondent Matthew Halton and sister of contemporary CBC journalist David Halton. Tynan convinced her to leave her husband and live with him. On 30 June 1967, before a New York Justice of the Peace, Tynan married a six-month pregnant Halton, with Marlene Dietrich as witness. During the ceremony, Dietrich backed towards some doors to close them; the judge interrupted his oration, and without change in tone or pace said: [...] "And do you, Kenneth, take Kathleen for your lawful-wedded—I wouldn't <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> ass to an open door in this office lady—wife to have and to hold?" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} the train being pulled by Rocket {{approached}} on the other line. Rocket was being driven by Joseph Locke, George Stephenson's assistant and future eminent engineer in his own rights. A shout went up, [...] "An engine is approaching. Take care, gentlemen!" [...] The other disembarked passengers either climbed back into their seats, or stepped over the northern line and {{completely out of the}} way. A third option was available, to <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> back to the stationary coaches, as there was a four-foot gap between the lines, and even though the Duke's private carriage was wider that then standard carriage, it would have still been possible to stand between the stationary and the travelling train and remain safe. However, what unfolded was a calamitous series of events. Huskisson was known to be clumsy. He had endured a long list of problems from his regular trips and falls, and he had twice broken his arm and never fully recovered the use of it. Add to this, that he was only a few weeks post surgery and was there against his doctor's advice.|$|E

6000|$|... "There will be fighting. And you--oh, I saw {{into your}} eyes {{the other night}} when you <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> hands up. You would kill anybody, Russ. It's awful! But don't think me a baby. I can {{conceive}} what your work is, what a man you must be. I can love you and stick to you, too. But if you killed a blood relative of mine I {{would have to give}} you up. I'm a Southerner, Russ, and blood is thick. I scorn my uncle and I hate my cousin George. And I love you. But don't you kill one of my family, I--Oh, I beg of you go as far as you dare to avoid that!" ...|$|R

If they have no candle, fling the water at a venture--fire into the brown! Lest we forget, I'll collar Comrade Jellicoe's jug now and keep it handy. A couple of sheets would also not be amiss--we will enmesh the enemy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Daniel," [...] the {{messenger}} said, [...] "ye lose great honour, by my sooth! The fight began {{again this morning}} ere the dawn, and we have beaten their van and scattered their right wing. Only the main battle standeth fast. An we had your fresh men, we should tilt you them all into the river. What, sir knight! Will ye be the last? It <b>stands</b> not <b>with</b> <b>your</b> good credit." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} would, only you mustn't <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> arm round your partner {{in this way}} when you are done. You must seat and fan her, if she likes it," [...] said Rose, anxious to perfect a pupil who seemed so lamentably {{in need of a}} teacher.|$|E
6000|$|... "Attend now, my braves.

'We will re-quest you, sir, if you please,' said Buffum, laying {{hands on}} Mr Pogram {{as if he}} were taking his measure for a coat, 'to <b>stand</b> up <b>with</b> <b>your</b> back agin the wall right in the furthest corner, that there may be more room for our fellow citizens. If you could set your back right slap agin that curtain-peg, sir, keeping your left leg everlastingly behind the stove, we should be fixed quite slick.' ...|$|R

"Now," [...] said Jimmy, {{breaking}} off his thread at last, [...] "I guess you might go 'most anywhere if you <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> {{face to the}} folks who talk to you, and don't sit down too suddenly.

6000|$|De Vaux {{spoke in}} a whisper to the King. [...] "Were it not well, my liege, to send a page {{to the top of}} that sand-bank?

6000|$|... "Did you say, come up stairs?" [...] {{continued}} the voice outside. [...] "All right; I have no objection, if Mrs. Blyth hasn't."

5000|$|Charles Passy of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution {{gave it a}} {{negative}} review, writing: [...] "Instead of a fairy tale, we have a tale told without imagination. It's Cinderella gone stale." [...] Andrew Chase of Killer Movie Reviews, however, was more positive. Chase wrote: [...] "Leave reality at the concession <b>stand</b> along <b>with</b> <b>your</b> $20 for popcorn, candy and a large drink". Derek Adams of Time Out wrote: [...] "Talented individuals labour over the contrivances in this lightweight romance, and if the result's fluff, at least it's painless." ...|$|R

6000|$|He {{seized upon}} this allusion to say: [...] "I {{did not think}} of {{including}} Mr. Clarke, Mrs. Lambert. I think you and your daughter have both had too much of him.

60|$|It is Mrs. Higgins's at-home day. Nobody has yet arrived.

The windows are open, giving access to a balcony with flowers in pots.

It will be worse for you than it was for me, for there was I, labouring and toiling like a dumb beast, with my mind intent upon working the gun, and paying no heed to the roar and {{confusion}} around, scarce even noticing when one beside me was struck down. You will be up on the poop, having naught to do but to <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> hand on your sword hilt, and waiting to board an enemy or to drive back one who tries to board you. You will find that you will be well-nigh dazed and stupid with the din and uproar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] Walter said, [...] "I will go first, at {{any rate}} for a time. I must put one leg through the loop, and sit, as it were, while I fasten the one above, as I shall want both hands for the work. You will find it a good deal easier to <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> foot in the loop.

60|$|After the {{arrangement}} of goods and chattels, came dinner (the curry warmed up with a second course of fried onions)--then the slinging of our hammocks by the neat hands of the Brothers Dobbs--and then the practice {{of how to get}} into the hammocks, by Messrs. Migott and Jollins. No landsman who has not tried the experiment can form the faintest notion of the luxury of the sailor's swinging bed, or of the extraordinary difficulty of getting into it for the first time. The preliminary action is to <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> back against the middle of your hammock, and to hold by the edge of the canvas on either side. You then duck your head down, throw your heels up, turn round on your back, and let go with your hands, all at the same moment. If you succeed in doing this, you are in the most luxurious bed that the ingenuity of man has ever invented. If you fail, you measure your length on the floor. So much for hammocks.|$|E

[...] This was the actual commencement of the fight; for as the shot of Tom Coffin traveled, {{as he had}} intimated, {{very much in the}} same direction, their enemy found the sport becoming too hot to be endured in silence, and the report of the second gun from the Ariel was instantly followed by that of the whole broadside of the Alacrity. The shot of the cutter flew in a very good direction, but her guns were too light to give them efficiency at that distance; and as one or two were heard to strike against the bends of the schooner, and fall back, innocuously, into the water, the cockswain, whose good-humor became gradually restored as the combat thickened, remarked with his customary apathy: ...|$|R
60|$|If a mob is {{climbing}} the stairs thirsting for your blood, {{you do not want}} to <b>stand</b> upright <b>with</b> <b>your</b> arms stretched out, a good eighteen inches from the door, while you go over at some length the varied incidents leading up to the annoyance. If your desire were to act naturally you would push against that door for all you were worth, and yell for somebody to bring you a chest of drawers and a bedstead, and things like that, to pile up against it. If you were a king, and were giving a party, you would not want your guests to fix you up at the other end of the room and leave you there, with nobody to talk to but your own wife, while they turned their backs upon you, and had a long and complicated dance all to themselves. You would want to be in it; you would want to let them know that you were king.|$|R
