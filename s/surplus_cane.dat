5000|$|This {{sugar mill}} {{produces}} <b>surplus</b> <b>cane</b> molasses {{which some of}} it are used to aliment the smaller distilleries around the commune. The Jean LÃ©opold Dominique sugar mill in Darbonne has the capacity of producing 375,000 metric tons of sugar; {{it also has the}} output capacity of 22 megawatts (MW) of electricity. The sugarcane industry is closely followed by the banana industry and then grains such as maize, sorghum and rice. Legumes and foodstuffs such as sweet potatoes, cassava, beans, and yams complete this chain. A significant amount of fishing and farming is practiced throughout the coastal areas. Aviculture and apiculture farms have been rapidly expanding in recent years.|$|E
40|$|In {{sugarcane}} biorefineries, the lignocellulosic {{portion of}} the sugarcane biomass (i. e. bagasse and cane trash) {{can be used as}} fuel for electricity production and/or feedstock for second generation (2 G) ethanol. This study presents a techno-economic analysis of upgraded sugarcane biorefineries in Brazil, aiming at utilizing <b>surplus</b> bagasse and <b>cane</b> trash for electricity and/or ethanol production. The study investigates the trade-off on sugarcane biomass use for energy production: bioelectricity versus 2 G ethanol production. The BeWhere mixed integer and spatially explicit model is used for evaluating the choice of technological options. Different scenarios are developed to find the optimal utilization of sugarcane biomass. The study finds that energy prices, type of electricity substituted, biofuel support and carbon tax, investment costs, and conversion efficiencies are the major factors influencing the technological choice. At the existing market and technological conditions applied in the upgraded biorefineries, 300 PJy^ 12 G ethanol could be optimally produced and exported to the EU, which corresponds to 2. 5 % of total transport fuel demand in the EU. This study provides a methodological framework on how to optimize the alternative use of agricultural residues and industrial co-products for energy production in agro-industrie...|$|R
