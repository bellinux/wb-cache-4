25|$|As {{stated in}} Telcordia {{industry}} requirements document , {{there are two}} principal configurations for closures: butt closures and in-line closures. Butt closures permit cables to enter the closure from one end only. This design may also {{be referred to as}} a dome closure. These closures {{can be used in a}} variety of applications, including branch <b>splicing.</b> In-line <b>closures</b> provide for the entry of cables at both ends of the closure. They can be used in a variety of applications, including branch splicing and cable access. In-line closures can also be used in a butt configuration by restricting cable access to one end of the closure.|$|R
40|$|Background: Endoplasmic {{reticulum}} (ER) {{stress and}} {{activation of the}} unfolded protein response (UPR) play important roles in chronic intestinal inflammation. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal emergency in preterm infants and is characterized by acute intestinal inflammation and necrosis. The objective of the study is to investigate the role of ER stress and the UPR in NEC patients. Methods: Ileal tissues from NEC and control patients were obtained during surgical resection and/or at stoma <b>closure.</b> <b>Splicing</b> of XBP 1 was detected using PCR, and gene expression was quantified using qPCR and Western blot. Results: Splicing of XBP 1 was only detected in a subset of acute NEC (A-NEC) patients, and not in NEC patients who had undergone reanastomosis (R-NEC). The other ER stress and the UPR pathways, PERK and ATF 6, were not activated in NEC patients. A-NEC patients showing XBP 1 splicing (A-NEC-XBP 1 s) had increased mucosal expression of GRP 78, CHOP, IL 6 and IL 8. Similar results were obtained by inducing ER stress and the UPR in vitro. A-NEC-XBP 1 s patients showed altered T cell differentiation indicated by decreased mucosal expression of RORC, IL 17 A and FOXP 3. A-NEC-XBP 1 s patients additionally showed more severe morphological damage and a worse surgical outcome. Compared with A-NEC patients, R-NEC patients showed lower mucosal IL 6 and IL 8 expressio...|$|R
