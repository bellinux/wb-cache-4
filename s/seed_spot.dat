In 1921, M. F. Barrus of Cornell University {{demonstrated}} that bean anthracnose is seedborne. This information resulted in the widespread use of anthracnose-free seed and a subsequent decline in the occurrence of bean anthracnose in the United States. In bean-growing areas that receive frequent rainfall, however, such as central and western New York State, epidemics of the disease may develop. Production is reduced because of poor seed germination, poor seedling vigor, and low yields. Marketing losses are attributed to <b>seed</b> <b>spots</b> and blemishes, which lower their quality rating and salability. The disease is most common and severe on dry and snap beans (P. vulgaris) but may also affect lima bean (P. lunatus L.), scarlet runner bean (P. multiflorus Willd.), mung bean (P. aureus Roxb.), cowpea (Vigna sinensis Savi), and broad bean (Vicia faba L.) ...|$|R

Such mutations evidently occurred by transposition of I-R away from the R locus to a site where it was identifiable as a modifier. M-st may be such a transposed I-R. Analysis of mutations to R-sc during the second (sperm-forming) mitosis in pollen grains showed that some of the transposed I-R elements were linked with R, whereas others assorted independently.

Foram utilizadas 128 amostras de 5 g de sementes provenientes de ensaios conduzidos nos municípios paulistas de Jaboticabal e Pindorama, no ano agrícola de 1982 / 83, e compostos de 16 cultivares de arroz-de-sequeiro, com quatro repetições. Para {{calcular}} o índice de intensidade de infecção, cada amostra foi separada visualmente em quatro categorias: n 0 = sem manchas; n 1 = poucas manchas (até 5 %); n 2 = muitas manchas (6 - 25 %), e n 3 = extremamente manchadas (acima de 25 % da superfície com manchas). A mesma amostra foi separada em sementes com e sem manchas, independente da quantidade de manchas que cada semente apresentasse, calculando-se a porcentagem das manchadas. A comparação da análise da variância e da correlação entre ambas as avaliações revelou que o índice de intensidade de infecção, denominado pelos autores de índice de intensidade de manchas, proporcionou maior discriminação entre os tratamentos que a porcentagem de sementes manchadas, sugerindo-o para a avaliação quantitativa de manchas de sementes de arroz.

The objective of this experiment was to compare the percentage of <b>spotted</b> <b>seeds</b> with an index of infection intensity, which gives a more precise quantitative information about the extension of the seed surface area infected. For this comparison, 5 g-rice-seed samples from two field trials, carried out in Jaboticabal and Pindorama, in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, in 1982 / 83, were used. Each trial had the same 16 cultivars with four replications, totalizing 64 samples per site. Seeds of each sample were visually separated in one of four categories: n 0 = spotless seeds; n 1 = up to 5 % of the seed surface spotted; n 2 = from 6 to 25 % of seed surface spotted; and n 3 = over 25 % of the <b>seed</b> surface <b>spotted.</b> The number of seeds was counted in each category in order to calculate the index of infection intensity. The same seed samples were separated in two groups: <b>spotted</b> and spotless <b>seeds,</b> independently of the surface area attacked.
