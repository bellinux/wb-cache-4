30|$|Real street {{data were}} chosen to {{evaluate}} the energy consumption. The ICEV Smart belongs to cars {{with some of the}} highest deviations between certified and reality fuel consumption (up to 60 % [1]). We chose a mileage of 100, 000 km {{on the assumption that the}} first battery will be kept within this range. Also, fossil-fuelled Smarts, on the other hand, can be expected to drive between 60, 000 and 120, 000 km with the first engine according to our knowledge, which allows a comparison between the ICEV and the electric version over 100, 000 km. Operation emissions are both dominating the CO 2 life cycle of the fossil fuel-propelled Smart (column 1, Figure 2) as well as an electric Smart (column 2, Figure 2) if charged with German mean grid electricity. This is in accordance with the findings of Helms et al. [40] as well as Notter et al. [61]. Other studies report higher BEV CO 2 life cycle impacts during operation when charged with grid mix, e.g. Helms et al. [40] with approximately 20 t (mid-size car) and Held and Baumann [42] also with approximately 20 t (mini-class), however recalculated for 150, 000 to 171, 600 km of operation. Other differences will partly be due to a higher battery and car weight (Table 5). However, we calculated the direct CO 2 emissions due to fuel combustion (including fuel chain emissions) as well as indirect CO 2 emissions due to consumption of the German grid electricity (for details, <b>see</b> <b>explanatory</b> notes in <b>Figure</b> 2). Calculation of CO 2 -equivalents based on ecoinvent 2.2 database adds up to 9.4 t instead of 8.2 t for the operation phase of the electric Smart (column 2 in Figure 2).|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} model for isotropization and {{corresponding}} thermalization in a nucleon system created in the collision of two nuclei. The model {{is based on the}} assumption: during the fireball evolution, two-particle elastic and inelastic collisions give rise to the randomization of the nucleon-momentum transfer which is driven by a proper distribution. As a first approximation, we assume a homogeneous distribution where the values of the momentum transfer is bounded from above. These features have been shown to result in a smearing of the particle momenta about their initial values and, as a consequence, in their partial isotropization and thermalization. The nonequilibrium single-particle distribution function and single-particle spectrum which carry a memory about initial state of nuclei have been obtained.

In this study, we assessed the RD of the humerus as an additional landmark to identify the elbow rotation axis on fluoroscopy images. The technique is easy to use intraoperatively and does not require extra equipment. First, we showed that the in vivo RD corresponding to an optimal on-axis lateral fluoroscopic image averaged 45 %. We also showed that measurement of the optimal RD was robust, as evidenced by good interobserver agreement and high correlation between measurements for elbows in extension and flexion. Secondly, we showed that a 10 -min teaching program with <b>explanatory</b> <b>figures</b> {{about the use of}} the optimal RD (Figs.  1, 2) improved the surgical accuracy in determining the elbow rotation axis, albeit these improvements were small.|$|R

40|$|Intrinsically cold {{particle}} {{dark matter}} inevitably creates halos with sharp discontinuities in projected surface density {{caused by the}} projection of fold catastrophes onto the sky. In principle, these imperfections can be detected and measured with gravitational lensing through discontinuities in image magnification and image structure. Lens solutions are discussed for the most common universal classes of discontinuities. Edges caused by cold particles such as condensed axions and thermal WIMPs are very sharp, respectively about $ 10 ^{- 12 }$ and $ 10 ^{- 7 }$ of the halo scale. Their structure can be resolved by stellar and quasi-stellar sources which show sudden changes in brightness or even sudden disappearances (sometimes within hours) as edges are crossed. Images of extended objects such as edge-on galaxies or jets can show sudden bends at an edge, or stretched, parity-inverted reflection symmetry about a sharp line.

40|$|We {{consider}} a generic diffusion on the 1 D torus {{and give a}} simple representation formula for the large deviation rate functional of its invariant probability measure, {{in the limit of}} vanishing noise. Previously, this rate functional had been characterized by M. I. Freidlin and A. D. Wentzell as solution of a rather complex optimization problem. We discuss this last problem in full generality and show that it leads to our formula. We express the rate functional by means of a geometric transformation that, with a Maxwell-like construction, creates flat regions. We then consider piecewise deterministic Markov processes on the 1 D torus and show that the corresponding large deviation rate functional for the stationary distribution is obtained by applying the same transformation. Inspired by this, we prove a universality result showing that the transformation generates viscosity solution of stationary Hamilton [...] Jacobi equation associated to any Hamiltonian H satisfying suitable weak conditions.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{developing}} a new wedge anchorage to anchor prestressed CFRP rods, five different anchorage designs were manufactured. These designs have led to a constantly increased ultimate failure load of the prestressing system and an eventual load level above 95 % of the ultimate failure load of the rod was achieved. If 100 % efficiency is achieved the anchorage does not reduce the capacity of the system, but failure is then governed by the capacity of the rod itself, which is considered favourable and required by several guidelines. In the process seven different failure modes were identified: soft slip, power slip, cutting of fibres, crushing of rod, bending of fibres, frontal overload and intermediate rupture. In this paper the failure modes are discussed further. The failures are documented with <b>explanatory</b> <b>figures</b> and their backgrounds are found in the theory. Suggestions are given on how these failures can be avoided in theory and practice. From the experiences gained in the project, it is concluded that it is a challenging task to create a fully mechanical anchorage for CFRP tendons and that the failure margins are small between a successful and an unsuccesful anchorage system.

40|$|The Society of Jesus {{made great}} {{propaganda}} efforts throughout {{the seventeenth century}} and chose the images and the play as a privileged means to communicate and persuade. Athanasius Kircher, a key figure of the seventeenth century, he decided to dominate the wild nature of sound through Phonurgia Nova, which includes a gallery of powerful symbolic images for Baroque aesthetics. The essay, through the grant of the images from the Library of the Department of Mathematics "Guido Castelnuovo" Sapienza University of Rome, aims to understand, through the pictures offered by Kircher, the sound phenomenon and the spectacle that this produces.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the Sommerfeld enhancement to dark matter annihilation {{in the presence of a}}n excited state, where the interaction inducing the enhancement is purely off-diagonal, such as in models of exciting or inelastic dark matter. We derive a simple and accurate semi-analytic approximation for the s-wave enhancement, which is valid provided the mass splitting between the ground and excited states is not too large, and discuss the cutoff of the enhancement for large mass splittings. We reproduce previously derived results in the appropriate limits, and demonstrate excellent agreement with numerical calculations of the enhancement. We show that the presence of an excited state leads to generically larger values of the Sommerfeld enhancement, larger resonances, and shifting of the resonances to lower mediator masses. Furthermore, in the presence of a mass splitting the enhancement is no longer a monotonic function of velocity: the enhancement where the kinetic energy is close to that required to excite the higher state can be up to twice as large as the enhancement at zero velocity.
