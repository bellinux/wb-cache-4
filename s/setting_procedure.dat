50|$|The {{unanimous}} opinion by Justice Harlan {{noted that there}} was no allegation that the NGA was unconstitutional, so the only issue in the case involved the statutory interpretation of the NGA. The opinion stated that the provision in the NGA requiring the filing of rate schedules was not a rate <b>setting</b> <b>procedure,</b> but a prerequisite to the establishment of new rates. While the NGArequired a gas company to file new rates and contracts with the FPC, it did not authorize the abrogation of any contract in effect. The FPC could investigate rates in contracts, but contracts could be modified or rejected by the FPC only if the rate in the contract was found to be so low as to be harmful to third parties and not in the public interest. Thus, a gas company had no authority to unilaterally change a rate in a contract by filing a new rate schedule with the FPC.|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} {{consisting of}} young people with Behavioral/Emotional/Learning challenges typically experiences poorer outcomes related to employment, {{in part due to}} lower performance levels. Effective strategies, which {{have a positive impact on}} work performance for this population, are needed. Goal setting has been used to bring about behavior change, or increase 2 ̆ 7 motivation 2 ̆ 7, in many fields of study. Goal setting can be conceptualized as an establishing operation (EO), which increases the reinforcing value of goal achievement, and thereby increases the probability of the occurrence of behaviors related to reaching the goal, i. e., task completion. This study empirically examined the impact of a goal <b>setting</b> <b>procedure</b> on work-related behaviors through the use of a singlecase experimental design, to detect the individual results of the goal setting intervention, which included the manipulation of environmental events to explain behavior change, or 2 ̆ 7 motivation 2 ̆ 7. It was hypothesized that the goal <b>setting</b> <b>procedure</b> would have a positive impact on work performance for these young people with challenges in a work-type setting. Results showed that the goal <b>setting</b> <b>procedure</b> did have a positive impact on the work performance of both participants, especially when additional prompts were included in the goal <b>setting</b> <b>procedure.</b> Although goal setting may serve as an EO, the goal <b>setting</b> <b>procedure,</b> which included additional elements such as prompts and feedback, seemed to be more effective...|$|E

40|$|The Bookmark {{standard}} <b>setting</b> <b>procedure</b> {{was developed}} to address the perceived problems with the most popular method for setting cutscores, the Angoff procedure (Angoff, 1971). The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to review the Bookmark procedure and then evaluate it in terms of Berk’s (1986) criteria for evaluating standard-setting methods. Finally, {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the Bookmark procedure are critically examined and discussed. In conclusion, the strengths of the Bookmark method are that it (a) accommodates constructedresponse as well as selected-response test items; (b) efficiently accommodates multiple cutscores and multiple test forms; and (c) reduces cognitive complexity for panelists. Despite of unsolved issues like the choice and understanding of the response probability, the Bookmark method is a promising standard <b>setting</b> <b>procedure</b> with its own characteristics and advantages.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper {{is to provide a}} {{methodology}} aimed at improving the setting up of air-jet looms by clarifying the function which links different important variables involved in the <b>setting</b> <b>procedure</b> and by proposing a method to measure the quality of fabrics depending on the factor values. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed procedure is based on the use of a load sensor: the tension profile received from it is used to analyse the weft behaviour and, sometimes, to predict any quality problems. Because of the high number of variables influencing the set up, the factorial experiments have been used to develop the <b>setting</b> <b>procedure.</b> Numerical results have been analyzed by means of a regression analysis and an ANOVA analysis. Findings – Relationships among different variables and their influence {{on the quality of the}} fabric have been derived thanks to the use of a load sensor. Research limitations/implications – So far, the proposed procedure has been developed for air-jet looms and for a limited set of fabrics, but it could be adapted in other situations as well. Practical implications – Use of the proposed procedure allows practitioners to reduce cost and time of the setting up of air jet looms. High productivity of air jet looms could be thus better exploited also for producing small batches of products. Originality/value – The combination of the load sensor and the statistical analysis allowed the development of a systematic <b>setting</b> <b>procedure</b> for air-jet looms...|$|E
