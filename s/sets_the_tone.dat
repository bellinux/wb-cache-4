During the cocktail hour, guests arrive {{to walk on the}} red carpet, tour the year's special themed exhibition, and be seated before the dinner party that includes entertainment from the preeminent entertainers of the day. The theme not only <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> for the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold the theme of the year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, the theme is a bit befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 the theme may be far more challenging to one gender than the other.|$|E
25|$|The first Achewood strip ("Philippe is {{standing}} on it") was released on October 1, 2001. Onstad has stated in multiple interviews that he was inspired to launch the strip {{by the events of}} September 11, 2001. The strip <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> for future strips with its nonsensical humor and flat visual punchline. In this particular strip, Mr. Bear and Téodor are discussing Téodor's confusion over a drum machine. Mr. Bear informs Téodor that there is an instruction manual.

Over {{the following}} 60 years or so, he {{is involved in}} many of the major military conflicts of the 19th century — always in spite of his best efforts to evade his duty. He is often selected for especially dangerous jobs because of his heroic reputation. He meets many famous people, and survives some of the worst military disasters (the First Anglo-Afghan War, Charge of the Light Brigade, the Siege of Cawnpore, Battle of the Little Bighorn, Battle of Isandlwana), always coming out with more heroic laurels. The date of his last adventures seems to have been around 1900. He dies in 1915.|$|E
25|$|In the novel, {{the story}} of Max Havelaar, a Dutch colonial administrator, is told by two {{diametrically}} opposed characters: the hypocritical coffee merchant Droogstoppel, who intends to use Havelaar's manuscripts {{to write about the}} coffee trade, and the romantic German apprentice Stern, who takes over when Droogstoppel loses interest in the story. The opening chapter of the book nicely <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> of the satirical nature of what is to follow, with Droogstoppel articulating his pompous and mercenary world-view at length. At {{the very end of the}} novel Multatuli himself takes the pen and the book culminates in a vocal denunciation of Dutch colonial policies and a plea to the king of the Netherlands to intervene on behalf of his Indonesian subjects.|$|E

500|$|... "Chapter 1" [...] <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> for the environs of the series. According to David Carr the {{political}} environs have such [...] "marbleness" [...] that it belies the clandestine nature of political activities, {{including those of}} Underwood who says he is there to [...] "clear the pipes and keep the sludge moving". The fictional newspaper, The Washington Herald, is set with [...] "brutal" [...] lighting and drab furniture, {{in part because it}} was filmed at the real life Baltimore Sun offices. Carr uses several pejorative adjectives to describe Barnes' apartment including sad, grubby, dirty, dreary and humble but note that this implies that the digital revolution is dominated by people [...] "on laptops who have no furniture". Similarly, Underwood and his associates are nattily clad, Barnes shows a lack of fashion recognition.|$|E
500|$|West's {{performance}} on the song is notably intense, forcefully rapping lines such as [...] "we above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all / I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall."

The second verse is delivered by Jay-Z, who spends {{the majority of his}} verse deconstructing the hate that surrounds fame and poses the question, [...] "would you rather be underpaid or overrated?" [...] Jay-Z comments on how a career in the music industry creates many opponents. The third verse is delivered by Pusha T, who muses on cocaine dealing.|$|E
500|$|... "I Want You" [...] {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Michael Paoletta of Billboard stated, [...] "the retro-vibed song {{calls to mind}} the sparkly yet wistful soul of '60s-era girl groups" [...] while maintaining [...] "a contemporary reference". Paoletta considered its aura and [...] "girl-desires-boy theme" [...] to make the track a [...] "crossover gem". West's production was also praised, adding [...] "the opening drum downbeat immediately <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone.</b> That beat smoothly propels the song, accompanied by swirling string crescendos that are the perfect backdrop for Jackson's breathy vocals", concluding it to potentially have [...] "multiformat popularity." [...] Ernest Hardy of LA Weekly called it [...] "a retro affair" [...] with a classic [...] "girl-group arrangement", while a critique from Gashaus noted the song [...] "shimmers with some of Janet's former iridescent glow." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised its [...] "impossibly lithe basseline", calling it an electronic reconstruction of a 1970s soul ballad, also determined to be [...] "not only inventive, but brilliantly constructed." ...|$|E

Producer and musician Chip Douglas has stated that he based the guitar riff for the Monkees' 1967 hit [...] "Pleasant Valley Sunday" [...] on that of the Beatles' song. Neil Innes of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band (and later the Rutles) recalls being at Abbey Road Studios while the Beatles were recording [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] and his band were working on a 1920s vaudeville song titled [...] "My Brother Makes the Noises for the Talkies". Innes said he heard the Beatles playing back [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] at full volume and appreciated then, {{in the words of}} music journalist Robert Fontenot, [...] "just how far out of their league he was, creatively". Innes has since included his recollection of this episode in his stage show.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, {{he served}} as a co-executive {{producer}} on Family Guy and executive producer on American Dad! from 2008 until 2009. Appel wrote the Family Guy seventh season episode [...] "Family Gay". Appel co-created, alongside Mike Henry and Seth MacFarlane, the Family Guy spin-off The Cleveland Show, which they began discussing in 2007 and which premiered September 27, 2009. He and Henry serve as the show's executive producers and showrunners, handling the day-to-day operations, with limited involvement from MacFarlane. Henry and Appel conceived the show as [...] "more of a family show, a sweeter show" [...] than Family Guy. The show, which was picked up to air a first season consisting of 22 episodes, was picked up by Fox for a second season, consisting of 13 episodes, bringing the total number to 35 episodes. The announcement was made on May 3, 2009 before the first season even premiered. It was extended to a full second season. Appel signed a new three-year, seven figure deal with Fox to continue serving as showrunner on The Cleveland Show in 2010.

Colin Moriarty of IGN felt that it was {{appropriate}} in every situation, praising its ability to create emotion and involve players in the experience. GameTrailers found the soundtrack [...] "powerful", commenting on its appropriate use during gameplay, and GamesRadar's Brittany Vincent named it [...] "breathtaking". Jen Bosier of Forbes approved of the soundtrack's usage within the game, particularly praising the piano pieces. Jim Sterling of Destructoid favorably compared the soundtrack to Dragon Quest VIII, praising the orchestral qualities and [...] "sense of fun". Chris Scullion of Computer and Video Games wrote that the music ensures the game [...] "sounds as good as it looks". Robert Steinman of RPGFan felt that the music perfectly <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> of the game, stating that it is among [...] "some of the best work" [...] of video game music, and Jasmine Rea of VentureBeat found that the music [...] "enhances the overall Ghibli quality" [...] to the game. Eurogamer's Oli Welsh called the music [...] "a lush and romantic treat", though criticized the repetitiveness of the battle music. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku echoed similar remarks, heavily criticizing the battle music, but otherwise calling the music [...] "uncommonly gorgeous".|$|E

500|$|Upon release, {{the album}} was well {{received}} by reviewers. Sounds gave Join Hands a grade of 4.5 out of 5, with the reviewer, Pete Silverton, noting {{a change in the}} sound: [...] "The mix is different to the last album. Now there's a clarity which frames Sue's voice like it was a thing of treasure". Silverton also wrote that some of the songs have [...] "Siouxsie's voice double-tracked with devastating effect". Jon Savage, a Melody Maker reviewer, described the first track, [...] "Poppy Day", as a [...] "short, powerful evocation of the Great War graveyards in Flanders". He also wrote that [...] "Placebo Effect" [...] "has a stunning flanged guitar intro, chasing clinical lyrics covering some insertion or operation". About [...] "Icon", Savage wrote: [...] "The brilliantly reverbed guitar is a perfect foil for Siouxsie's soaring and, for once, emotional vocal." [...] Savage noted that the five songs of the first side [...] "rise and fall into another in a stunning segue". Similarly, Paul Morley [...] wrote in NME that [...] "Side one's five songs [...] are all addictive Banshees mini-dramas". Ronnie Gurr, a Record Mirror reviewer, also hailed the record, saying: [...] "Poppy Day establishes the band's perfect employ of atmospherics and <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> of all the tracks". [...] "Mother" [...] was compared to the soundtrack of an Alfred Hitchcock film, with Gurr noting that the [...] "track features a musical box, echoes menacing guitar grumblings and Siouxsie providing vocals that would befit any of Hitchcock's best matricides". Gurr concluded that with [...] "Severin's truly disturbing scratchings", Join Hands was a dangerous work that [...] "should be heard".|$|E
500|$|In 2005 Lancashire {{starred in}} The Rotters' Club as a {{housewife}} in 1970s Birmingham. Also in 2005 {{she appeared in}} the BBC television film Cherished as Angela Cannings, a British woman who was wrongfully convicted of killing her two baby sons. Lancashire was proud {{to be involved with}} the project, having greatly admired Cannings strength of character during her ordeal, and being able to relate to her sense of anguish as a parent. In December 2005, Lancashire returned to West End theatre, taking on the role of Miss Adelaide in the Donmar Warehouse production of Guys and Dolls at the Piccadilly Theatre. Lancashire was due to stay with the production until March 2006, but due to a severe chest infection made her last appearance on 4 January. In 2006 Lancashire accepted an invitation to write a short autobiographic entry in Who's Who, an establishment [...] "bible" [...] of influential figures judged to have {{had a significant impact on}} British life and culture. Lancashire's only television acting role in 2006 was as house-wife and cake-maker Elaine in the BBC comedy drama Angel Cake. In November she presented an episode of the Five documentary series Disappearing Britain in which she interviewed people with memories of Wakes Week holidays in Blackpool during the early 20th century. In February 2007 she made an appearance in the E4 teen drama series Skins. This was followed by a leading role in the BBC Two television drama Sex, the City and Me as solicitor Ruth Gilbert. In October, Lancashire appeared in her first feature film, David Nicholls' And When Did You Last See Your Father? in which she played aunt Beaty. In December, she played the supporting role of Mrs Corney in the BBC's 2007 adaption of Charles Dickens' 1838 novel Oliver Twist. Whilst ambivalent about the serial as a whole, The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon singled Lancashire out for praise stating that she [...] "really <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> for the cold, unfeeling world into which orphaned Oliver is born." ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> for the whole project".|$|E
