40|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>aluminium.</b> <b>alloy</b> {{castings}} {{generally have}} inferior ductility compared to primary alloy castings as the {{higher level of}} impurities form brittle intermetallic phases. It is possible to reduce the detrimental effect of impurities by grain refinement thus reducing the size of these brittle phases. However, these impurities may complicate the process of grain refinement. This work investigates the effect of Cu and impurities typically found in secondary alloys on the grain size of the primary aluminium-silicon alloy A 356. The addition of 3 wt% Cu to grain refined A 356 alloy {{had little or no}} effect on grain size. However, a combined addition of Cu plus Fe, Cr, Zn and Mn to A 356 to make a pseudo secondary 319 alloy significantly increased the gain size. When the impurity elements Fe, Cr, Mn and Zn were added individually, Fe and Cr were identified as the main elements responsible for the increased grain size...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} a {{comparative}} study of metallurgical characteristics of the different aluminium alloys gotten through recycling of recovered aluminium in Cameroon. A simple experimental device for the foundry of secondary aluminium blend, of very good quality built around a movable charcoal furnace is presented. It enables better energy efficiency, a better distribution of the heat around the crucible and indirectly assures good quality of the products obtained, while respecting the economic constraints and users' safety. Six refining methods are proposed {{by the addition of}} polyvinyl chloride (method A), coke rich in carbon CHS (method C), ammonium chloride NH 4 Cl (method E), manganese dioxide MnO (method T), acrylic nitrite (C 2 H 3 Cl) n (method P) and sodium chloride NaCl (method S). A critical analysis of the different recycling techniques is presented as well as a proposed process of melting and refining that enables the obtaining products with high degrees of purity. The results are then compared to the results obtained from the industrial methods of aluminium refining such as fractional crystallization (FC), granular filtration (GF) and dissolution in a metal solvent (DS). The later (DS) gives the rate of 6. 540 % of accumulated alloy elements and enables the best purification (93. 460 %), while the NaCl gives the lowest global rate of additive elements (9. 478 %), with the best purity index (90. 522 %) amount the proposed methods.

40|$|Al-Si alloys {{are very}} {{universal}} materials, comprising of from 85 % to 90 % of the aluminium cast parts produced for {{the automotive industry}} (e. g. various motor mounts, engine parts, cylinder heads, pistons, valve retainer, compressor parts, etc.). Production of primary Al- alloys belong to heavy source fouling of life environs.

Recycled (<b>secondary)</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> are made out of Al-scrap and workable Al-garbage by recycling. The automotive casts from <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> are heat treated for achieving better properties. Al-Si alloys contain more addition elements, that form various intermetallic phases in the structure. They usually contain a certain amount of Fe, Mn, Mg, and Zn that are present either unintentionally, or they are added deliberately to provide special material properties. These elements partly go into the solid solution in the matrix and partly form intermetallic particles during solidification which affect the mechanical properties.

40|$|Recycling play a {{key role}} on saving of natural {{resources}} and on reducing pollution. The recycling of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> is also cost-effective, since it reduce the material cost and creates a considerable energy-saving. The use of recycled Al alloys (usually called secondary) has improved in recent years also because of their comparable mechanical properties with primary <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> During the production of <b>secondary</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys,</b> the scrap are mixed regardless of their specific chemical composition, and then master alloys or pure elements are added to the molten metal. Furthermore, certain impurity elements are either difficult or expensive to remove, and their role in mechanical properties can be important. Due to the presence of these additional trace elements, a number of complex intermetallic phases can therefore form in multi-component Al-Si alloys. Mechanical and physical properties of alloys and castings are strongly related to sizes, morphologies and distribution of these intermetallic phases, which are in turn a function of alloy composition and cooling rate. The Al–Si based alloys are transversally used in different foundry processes. Among all the technologies, high-pressure die-casting (HPDC) represents the most common process to produce automotive components by secondary Al–Si alloys because it allows one to increase the production by lowering the cycle time and to obtain economically components with complex geometries and high quality surface. The effects of trace elements and intermetallics phases on features of aluminium castings are still not fully understood, especially when components are made by means of HPDC process. The motivation of the research presented in this doctoral thesis was, therefore, to fill this gap in knowledge. The study has aimed at understanding the influence of various trace elements on the microstructure and mechanical properties of <b>secondary</b> die-cast <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> and, in particular, on secondary AlSi 9 Cu 3 (Fe) die-cast alloys. A literature review and a sufficient background of previously reported results on the influence of trace elements on the features of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> as well as the formation of intermetallic phases were carried out. It was found that the mechanical and microstructural analysis generally referred to primary cast Al alloys with low concentration of trace elements outside of those studied. Furthermore the samples were usually produced on gravity die-cast, while some intermetallics phases were frequently observed in high-pressure die-casting, where higher cooling rates and different feeding conditions exist. Special attention has been given to: The effects of Bismuth addition on <b>secondary</b> die-cast <b>aluminium</b> alloys: Bismuth substitute the lead in free-cutting wrought Al alloys, and this is leading to a steady increase of Bi content in secondary Al alloys due to the recycling process. The nucleation temperature of primary Fe-rich intermetallic compounds, as function of Fe, Mn and Cr content and cooling rate: Fe-rich phases have a high specific gravity and tend to segregate to the bottom of aluminium melts and holding furnaces. These phases form primary solid particles, generally called sludge, thus reduce the effective capacity of the furnace. The influence of Fe, Mn and Cr addition, separately or in combination, on the microstructural and mechanical characteristics of <b>secondary</b> die-cast <b>aluminium</b> alloys: sludge crystals are hard and brittle compact inclusions which can compromise the machining operations, with a considerable effects on the cutting tool life, and even more degrade the mechanical and physical properties of the component. As recycling of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> becomes more common, sludge will be a problem of increasing importance due to the concentration of Fe, Mn and Cr in the scrap cycle...|$|R
40|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>aluminium</b> and <b>alloys</b> {{are getting}} wide {{acceptance}} world-wide since recycling process requires lower potential energy than primary aluminium production. The control of type {{and amount of}} trace elements during recycling operations can be either difficult and expensive. Furthermore, the role of trace elements in foundry metallurgy is not fully understood, {{even if it is}} sometimes a tool actually used to manipulate the microstructure of the alloys. Trace elements can be beneficial, as well as detrimental to the structure and properties of the alloy. Effects of Chromium and Bismuth additions to an AlSi 9 Cu 3 (Fe) secondary diecasting alloy on the microstructure and mechanical properties are investigated. The results indicate that the area fraction and the size of α-Alx(Fe,Mn,Cr) ySiz intermetallic compounds increases by increasing the Cr content, and this affects the ultimate tensile strength and the ductility of the alloy at the highest Cr level.
