25|$|Both {{of these}} EMFs, despite their {{apparently}} distinct origins, are {{described by the}} same equation, namely, the EMF is {{the rate of change}} of magnetic flux through the wire. (This is Faraday's law of induction, see below.) Einstein's special theory of relativity was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects. In fact, the electric and magnetic fields are different facets of the same electromagnetic field, and in moving from one inertial frame to another, the <b>solenoidal</b> vector field portion of the E-field can change {{in whole or in part}} to a B-field or vice versa.|$|E
500|$|In her post-war research, Wu {{continued}} to investigate beta decay. Enrico Fermi had published {{his theory of}} Beta decay in 1934, but an experiment by Luis Walter Alvarez had produced results at variance with the theory. Wu set out to repeat the experiment and verify the result. She suspected that {{the problem was that}} a thick and uneven film of copper(II) sulfate (...) was being used as a copper-64 beta ray source, which was causing the emitted electrons to lose energy. To get around this, she adapted an older form of spectrometer, a <b>solenoidal</b> spectrometer. She added detergent to the copper sulphate to produce a thin and even film. She was then able to demonstrate that the discrepancies observed were the result of experimental error; her results were consistent with Fermi's theory.|$|E

Here, {{the projections}} are accomplished by the orthogonality of the <b>solenoidal</b> and irrotational function spaces.

This result follows from the Helmholtz Theorem (also known as the fundamental theorem of vector calculus). The first equation is a pressureless governing equation for the velocity, while the second equation for the pressure is a functional of the velocity and is related to the pressure Poisson equation.|$|E
2500|$|The calorimeters are {{situated}} outside the <b>solenoidal</b> magnet {{that surrounds the}} Inner Detector. [...] Their purpose is to measure the energy from particles by absorbing it. [...] There are two basic calorimeter systems: an inner electromagnetic calorimeter and an outer hadronic calorimeter. [...] Both are sampling calorimeters; that is, they absorb energy in high-density metal and periodically sample {{the shape of the}} resulting particle shower, inferring the energy of the original particle from this measurement.|$|E
2500|$|Among the two larger detectors, STAR {{is aimed}} at the {{detection}} of hadrons with its system of time projection chambers covering a large solid angle and in a conventionally generated <b>solenoidal</b> magnetic field, while PHENIX is further specialized in detecting rare and electromagnetic particles, using a partial coverage detector system in a superconductively generated axial magnetic field. The smaller detectors have larger pseudorapidity coverage, PHOBOS has the largest pseudorapidity coverage of all detectors, and tailored for bulk particle multiplicity measurement, while BRAHMS is designed for momentum spectroscopy, in order to study the so-called [...] "small-x" [...] and saturation physics. There is an additional experiment, PP2PP (now part of STAR), investigating spin dependence in p+p scattering.|$|E
2500|$|Gauss's law for {{magnetism}} {{states that}} there are no [...] "magnetic charges" [...] (also called magnetic monopoles), analogous to electric charges. Instead, the magnetic field due to materials is generated by a configuration called a dipole. Magnetic dipoles are best represented as loops of current but resemble positive and negative 'magnetic charges', inseparably bound together, having no net 'magnetic charge'. In terms of field lines, this equation states that magnetic field lines neither begin nor end but make loops or extend to infinity and back. In other words, any magnetic field line that enters a given volume must somewhere exit that volume. Equivalent technical statements are that the sum total magnetic flux through any Gaussian surface is zero, or that the magnetic field is a <b>solenoidal</b> vector field.|$|E

50|$|<b>Solenoidal</b> has {{its origin}} in the Greek word for solenoid, which is σωληνοειδές (sōlēnoeidēs) meaning pipe-shaped, from σωλην (sōlēn) or pipe. In the present context of <b>solenoidal</b> it means {{constrained}} {{as if in a}} pipe, so with a fixed volume.|$|E
50|$|The <b>solenoidal</b> vector {{fields are}} those with div X = 0. It {{follows from the}} {{definition}} of the Lie derivative that the volume form is preserved under the flow of a <b>solenoidal</b> vector field. Thus <b>solenoidal</b> vector fields are precisely those that have volume-preserving flows. This fact is well-known, for instance, in fluid mechanics where the divergence of a velocity field measures the compressibility of a fluid, which in turn represents the extent to which volume is preserved along flows of the fluid.|$|E

50|$|DNA {{supercoiling}} {{is important}} for DNA packaging within all cells. Because the length of DNA can be thousands of times that of a cell, packaging this genetic material into the cell or nucleus (in eukaryotes) is a difficult feat. Supercoiling of DNA reduces the space and allows for DNA to be packaged. In prokaryotes, plectonemic supercoils are predominant, because of the circular chromosome and relatively small amount of genetic material. In eukaryotes, DNA supercoiling exists on many levels of both plectonemic and <b>solenoidal</b> supercoils, with the <b>solenoidal</b> supercoiling proving most effective in compacting the DNA. <b>Solenoidal</b> supercoiling is achieved with histones to form a 10 nm fiber. This fiber is further coiled into a 30 nm fiber, and further coiled upon itself numerous times more.|$|E
