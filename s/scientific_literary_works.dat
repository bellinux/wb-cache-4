40|$|To have a {{satisfactory}} distribution structure today {{is vital for}} companies in the industry of trade to remain competitive and achieve financial success. Especially in the fashion industry there are very high demands on the company's distribution- and marketing strategies to achieve financial success. The market for fashion and clothing products is extremely competitive and is dominated by large multinational actors. Globalization and outsourcing of production amongst other processes is further increasing the demands on the company's distribution technology. The report examines a small trading company active in the fashion industry that develops, imports, distributes and sells underwear made with organic cotton. In the current situation the company is {{in its early stages}} with relatively small sales volumes, but future plans include expansion both at domestic and international markets. The survey aims to give the company a deeper understanding of its current distribution strategy, as well as providing recommendations on distribution- and marketing strategies for both the present and the future. The analysis is based on relevant theories within the fields of logistics and marketing that are taken from several <b>scientific</b> <b>literary</b> <b>works</b> and articles, as well as empirical information gathered from a conducted interview with the Chief Executive officer (CEO), also responsible for the company’s daily operations. The methodology for the analysis and the recommendations made are based on a triangulation of the theoretical and empirical information gathering...|$|E

He wrote extensively about this subject, and, from 1827 onwards, he sustained a close friendship with Wordsworth who provided detailed critical analyses of Hamilton’s own poems. Influenced by these revealing exchanges, Hamilton identified poetical qualities in physical and mathematical treatises, and this article probes his views concerning these perceived interconnections with reference to other ‘Romantic’ scientists such as Humphry Davy. In particular, Hamilton’s striking claim that a text such as Joseph-Louis Lagrange’s Mécanique Analytique (1788) can be viewed as ‘a kind of scientific poem’ is assessed...|$|R

50|$|Criticism is {{considered}} rhetorical when {{it focuses on}} the way some types of discourse react to situational exigencies—problems or demands—and constraints.

Contemporary rhetorical criticism has maintained aspects of early neo-Aristotelian thinking through close reading, which attempts to explore the organization and stylistic structure of a rhetorical object. Using close textual analysis means rhetorical critics use the tools of classical rhetoric and literary analysis to evaluate the style and strategy used to communicate the argument.|$|R

50|$|Resistance to {{modernisation}} in Spain {{was expressed}} in the strong antagonism between the Francophiles and their opponents the :es:’’casticistas’’, who accused the Francophiles {{of all sorts of}} religious heterodoxy - Jansenism, Freemasonry, pantheism, freethinking, Voltairianism, agnosticism, atheism - as exemplified in the trial of Pablo de Olavide. Paradoxically, those among the clergy who became victims of persecution were the most scientifically educated group: the Jesuits, who were expelled from Spain in 1767, having been blamed for the Esquilache Riots. Their schools and libraries were closed down and their members dispersed, although many of them based themselves in Rome and continued to publish <b>scientific</b> and <b>literary</b> <b>works</b> in Spanish. The Piarists became the order most engaged with teaching outside the university, although at a much more elementary level - the Jesuits focussed on the social and intellectual élite. The Society of Jesus was re-introduced to Spain during the 19th century, was again suppressed during the Second Republic and was restored under Franco.

40|$|This {{article has}} the aim {{to show that}} there is a {{circularity}} of ideas shared by Mircea Eliade and Ioan Petru Culianu. Apart from the analysis of their <b>scientific</b> and <b>literary</b> <b>works,</b> the focus on their epistolary dialogues helps us identifying common beliefs and illustrates the process of writing books and articles by means of exchanging new and interesting ideas between the master Mircea Eliade and the disciple Ioan Petru Culianu. However, the master – disciple epistolary dialogue becomes an example that writers can follow whenever they want to realize monographs about Postmodernist writers. The article includes two main parts. On the one hand, there is the part concerning the analysis of the letters Mircea Eliade addressed to his disciple, the most relevant aspect being Mircea Eliade’s methodical optimism conveyed to his disciple by means of their correspondence, and on the other hand, there is another part regarding the analysis of the epistolary texts Ioan Petru Culianu addressed to his master and at this level, what is very important is Ioan Petru Culianu’s follow of the initiation labyrinthic path shaped by his master. Moreover, there are various methods used in this article, written in accordance with Ioan Petru Culianu’s interdisciplinary aim, because it includes a pragmasemantic approach, by means of pragmatic deductions, inductions and inferences adapted to the context, combined with references to anthropology, history of religions and literary world...|$|R
40|$|This {{literary}} {{analysis is}} {{viewed from the}} theory of social <b>literary</b> criticism. <b>Literary</b> <b>work</b> is the mirror of human life that reflects the kinds of human thoughts, feeling and behaviors. By <b>literary</b> <b>work,</b> people can interpret human creation into something that larger than life beyond imagination. In this study, the researcher looks that hundreds of social phenomena and problems; racism {{is the most common}} issues discussed by the sociologist, anthropologist, and every part of society. Racism is considered the most complex social problem which causes an endless conflict between the dominant group and the minority. Racism is also an interesting topic to be analyzed because racism is the commons problems with difficult solution to reduce and avoid it, and it becomes complicated problem in some aspects of our life, moreover in modern era. Studies concerning racism are widely elaborated in many references, <b>scientific</b> books, and <b>literary</b> <b>works.</b> One of the <b>literary</b> <b>works</b> which explores such phenomena is James Mc Bride’s Miracle at St Anna. Based on the background of the study above, the problems of my studies are the first is what are the racist treatments experienced by Blacks as portrayed in James Mc Bride’s Miracle at St Anna? And the second is to what extent does James Mc Bride’s Miracle at St Anna reflects the real condition of racist treatment to the Blacks by the Germany. To achieve the above objectives of the study, the researcher categorizes as literary criticism since the researcher conduct the interpretation and analysis on <b>literary</b> <b>work.</b> The researcher sees this <b>literary</b> <b>work</b> from two points of views, intrinsic and extrinsic than the researcher uses genetic structuralism theory in doing this analysis and connect directly to the phenomena at that time. Based on the researcher’s analysis, racism portrayed in the novel takes one main forms, i. e. racism form of rejection. Racist attitudes is caused by the motive of exploitation, domination and minorities group, cause of difference skin, quality of IQ, struggle of equality. And all the data that are found by the researcher reflect the real society and the condition of American and Germany World War II in Italy 1944...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to show the fact that there is a {{continuity}} of ideas between Mircea Eliade and Ioan Petru Culianu’s systems of thought. Mircea Eliade is fascinated with the power of active imagination, illustrated by myths and symbols which are typical of collective unconscious, because they have been used from the beginning of this world up to the contemporary world. However, we can find such representations in Mircea Eliade and Ioan Petru Culianu’s both <b>scientific</b> and <b>literary</b> <b>works.</b> The comparative interdisciplinary approach is used in this article. On the one hand, there is the comparison between Mircea Eliade and Ioan Petru Culianu’s systems of thought and on the other hand, the interdisciplinary approach arises from the connections established between various sciences, like: the history of religions, anthropology, philosophy and natural sciences. The similarities and differences between their systems of thought are illustrated in this article. Firstly, the description of Mircea Eliade’s scientific system includes the diachronic study of religious ideas and the emphasis on human active imagination as a mechanism of compensation for the ontological suffering. Secondly, the principles of the universal method belonging to Ioan Petru Culianu, the mythical and symbolic representations from the Romanian writer’s literary works: The Emerald Game and Hesperus are also illustrated in this article. Researchers in the philological field can use both the comparative interdisciplinary approach in their future activity and the premise of continuity between Mircea Eliade and his disciple’s systems of thought. Apart from the main approach and premise of this article, the original perspective is represented by the mythical and symbolic representations from Ioan Petru Culianu’s science fiction novel entitled Hesperus...|$|R
