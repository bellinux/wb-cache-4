50|$|Another {{source of}} error present in most interferograms {{is caused by the}} {{propagation}} of the waves through the atmosphere. If the wave travelled through a vacuum it should theoretically be possible (subject to sufficient accuracy of timing) to use the two-way travel-time of the wave in combination with the phase to calculate the exact distance to the ground. However, the velocity of the wave through the atmosphere is lower than the speed of light in a vacuum, and depends on air temperature, pressure and the partial pressure of water vapour. It is this unknown phase delay that prevents the integer number of wavelengths being calculated. If the atmosphere was horizontally homogeneous over the length scale of an interferogram and vertically over that of the topography then the effect would simply be a constant phase difference between the two images which, since phase difference is measured relative to other points in the interferogram, would not contribute to the signal. However, the atmosphere is laterally heterogeneous on length scales both larger and smaller than typical deformation signals. This <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> can appear completely unrelated to the surface features of the image, however, in other cases the atmospheric phase delay is caused by vertical inhomogeneity at low altitudes and this may result in fringes appearing to correspond with the topography.|$|E

The {{received}} signal {{may contain}} {{not only the}} desired signal and white noise but also some <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> and interference. The <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> may be generated by Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) due to its nonlinearity [79] or other intentional/unintentional transmitters. If the sensing antenna is near some electronic devices, the <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> generated by the devices can be strong in the received signal. For some sensing methods, such unwanted signals will be detected as signals rather than noise. This will increase the probability of false alarm. There are methods to mitigate the <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> at the device level [79]. Alternatively, signal processing techniques {{can be used to}} eliminate the impact of spurious signal/interference [53]. It is very difficult, if possible, to estimate the interference waveform or distribution because of its variation with time and location. Depending on situations, the interference power could be lower or higher than the noise power. If the interference power is much higher than the noise power, it is possible to estimate the interference first and subtract it from the received signal. However, since we usually intend to detect signal at very low SNR, the error of the interference estimation could be large enough (say, larger than the primary signal) such that the detection with the residue signal after the interference subtraction is still unreliable. If the interference power is low, it is hard to estimate it anyway. Hence, in general we cannot rely on the interference estimation and subtraction, especially for very low-power signal detection.|$|E
40|$|A {{well-known}} but {{poorly understood}} phenomenon in analog integrated circuits is RFI rectification, specifically as {{it occurs in}} op amps and in-amps. While amplifying very small signals these devices can rectify large-amplitude, out-of-band HF signals, i. e., RFI. As a result, dc errors appear at the output {{in addition to the}} desired signal. The undesired HF signals can enter sensitive analog circuits by various means. Conductors leading {{into and out of the}} circuit provide a path for interference coupling into a circuit. These conductors pick up noise through capacitive, inductive, or radiation coupling. The <b>spurious</b> <b>signals</b> appear at the amplifier inputs, along with the desired <b>signal.</b> The <b>spurious</b> <b>signals</b> can be several tens of mV in amplitude however, which causes problems. Simply stated, it cannot be assumed that a sensitive, lowbandwidth dc amplifier will always reject out-of-band <b>spurious</b> <b>signals.</b> While this would be the case for a simple linear low pass filter, op amp and in-amp devices actually rectify high-level HF signals, leading to non-linearities and anomalous offsets.

40|$|Background: Delusions of {{reference}} (DOR) are {{a group of}} highly prevalent psychotic symptoms. In DOR, patients experience attentional capture by certain otherwise neutral aspects in the environment, which were regarded as self-referential. Theoretically, aberrant salience {{as a result of}} excessive dopamine firing may lead to <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> detection in patients with DOR. We test the hypothesis that patients presenting with and DOR have increased false alarms in a visual and an auditory signal detection task, compared with patients not experiencing the symptom and with healthy controls. Methods: A total of 32 patients with first-episode schizophrenia (mean age 24. 3 ± 6. 9 years, 19 men) and 17 healthy controls (mean age 24. 7 ± 7. 7 years, 9 men) were recruited. Controls and patients were matched in age, sex and education. Patients were further divided into a DOR group (n= 15) and a non-DOR group (n= 17). DOR was assessed using the Ideas of Reference Interview Scale (IRIS). <b>Spurious</b> <b>signal</b> detection was tested using the randomized and sequential Contour Integration Test (Field, Hayes, and Hess 1993) for visual processing and the Babble Task (Hoffman et al, 2007) for auditory processing. Performance was compared between groups using ANOVA and post-Hoc analysis. Signal detection analyses were carried out to differentiate between genuine <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> detection and response bias. Relationship between IRIS scores and false alarm rates was explored. Results: <b>Spurious</b> <b>signal</b> detection was observed in both DOR groups and healthy controls in low signal-to-noise trials. In the Contour Integration Test, patients with DOR were more likely to detect spurious signals particularly when the stimuli were presented at a moderate signaltonoise ratio compared with the other two groups (p< 0. 01), with an effect size of 1. 11 (Cohen’s d). False alarms are correlated with DOR severity (r= 0. 39, p< 0. 01). All three groups demonstrated good sensitivity and conservative response in signal detection. A similar trend was seen in the Babble Task. Discussion: <b>Spurious</b> <b>signal</b> detection is a common phenomenon under noisy conditions, which can be elicited also in healthy subjects. In DOR, there appears to be increased <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> detection, at a moderate signal-to-noise ratio. This observation cannot be accounted for by a general decline in task performance or a more liberal response bias, suggesting genuine false detection of signals in patients with DOR.
