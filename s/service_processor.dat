40|$|Abstract — As {{stateful}} flow-aware {{services are}} becoming com-monplace, distributed router architectures have to quickly assign packets being forwarded to service-specialized processors in or-der to balance flow processing and state among them. Moreover, packets {{belonging to the}} same flow must be always assigned to the same CPU, even {{if some of the}} <b>service</b> <b>processors</b> become unavailable. This paper presents two novel Fast Robust Hashing algorithms for persistent Flow-to-CPU mapping, that require less hashing operations per packet than previous Robust Hash algorithms, thus being able to fulfill all the above requirements to implement flow-aware services at wire-speed.

Technological advancements have resulted in {{significant changes in the}} processor architecture of mobile phones; transforming the typical mobile phones of 1990 ’s to modern smart phones. The design and deployment of mobile processors over the years is largely affected by Communication, performance, and low-power operation. The transition from analog to digital telephony has resulted in mobile devices delivering a wide range of data services. To support these <b>services,</b> <b>processor</b> architecture has now become much more complex. Mobile processors are growing rapidly with each passing generation.

40|$|Naming is {{critical}} in distributed systems. Names identify files, <b>services,</b> <b>processors,</b> and users.

Existing naming techniques are derived from techniques used on centralized systems and are not sufficient for organizing the large number of objects that are becoming available. This dissertation presents the Virtual System Model, a new model for naming that helps users organize the information available in large systems. The Virtual System Model has four principal features: support for customizable name spaces, tools to help users construct name spaces, support for synonyms, and a m [...] ...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} {{distinguishing feature}} of the CS6400 which was not shared by the Sun SPARCcenter and SPARCserver was that each system was invariably equipped with an external System <b>Service</b> <b>Processor</b> (SSP) fitted with a JTAG interface to configure the internal bus control card, the other systems have a JTAG interface {{but it is not}} routinely used. While the CS6400 strictly only requires an SSP when the configuration changes, (e.g. a CPU card is pulled for maintenance) some derivative designs, in particular the Sun Enterprise 10000, are useless without their matching SSP.|$|E
