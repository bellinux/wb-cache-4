40|$|A {{system of}} {{surcharge}} load combined with vertical drains {{to speed up}} consolidation of soft soil by reducing the drainage path {{is one of the}} most efficient and economical ground improvement techniques. In the field, conventional theories including smear zone have been commonly employed to predict the radial consolidation behaviour induced by vertical drains in soft clay. One of the key parameters in conventional analysis is the use of mean coefficient of volume compressibility and soil permeability, which are often assumed to be constant. The effect of drain installation on the <b>soil</b> <b>compressibility</b> of the in situ clay structure is often ignored. Laboratory testing has shown that the <b>soil</b> <b>compressibility</b> and permeability can vary nonlinearly over a considerable range of applied surcharge pressure, and both these properties can be affected during the drain installation. This study presents a mathematical model of radial consolidation via vertical drains incorporating the variations of <b>soil</b> <b>compressibility</b> and permeability as well as highlighting the effects of drain installation on those parameters. The main differences between the proposed and conventional models are elucidated, in terms of stress history and preloading (surcharge) pressure. The effects of preconsolidation pressure and the magnitude of applied preloading are examined through the dissipation of average excess pore pressure and associated settlement. Supported by experimental observations, the proposed theory is validated with field data of a selected case study in the town of Ballina, New South Wales, Australia...|$|E

40|$|When a pile is {{installed}} in a layer of soft and compressible soil, the pile would be subjected to skin friction as the consequence of the relative settlements between the soil and the pile. Negative skin friction (NSF) is mobilized when soil settles more than the pile while positive skin friction (PSF) occurs vice versa. The location where NSF changes to PSF is called the neutral plane {{which is also the}} position where the relative movement is zero. This paper presents the results of a series of axis-symmetric coupled-consolidation finite element modeling of a wish-in-place pile embedded in a consolidating ground. Geometric non-linearity technique is adopted and the pile-soil interface is assumed to follow a bi-linear Coulomb type frictional behavior. Attempts have been made to study the effects of the <b>soil's</b> <b>compressibility,</b> pile head loading and pile end-bearing type on the development of skin friction and neutral plane with time. It is found that NSF is fully mobilized near the ground surface. In the case of floating piles, the neutral plane locates at about 65 % of the pile embedment length in long term regardless the <b>soil's</b> <b>compressibility.</b> The plane moves upward when a pile head loading is applied. The amount of dragload can be substantial compared to the pile head loading. 90 % of the neutral plane's final position is reached when only 50 % average degree of consolidation is complete, regardless the <b>soil's</b> <b>compressibility</b> and the magnitude of pile head load. For fixed-end piles, neutral plane always locates at the pile toe in long term. However, the position is not reached instantly when surcharge is placed in the case of loaded piles. © 2010 American Institute of Physics. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Compressibility of a soil mass is its {{susceptibility}} to decrease in volume under pressure and {{is indicated by}} soil characteristics like coefficient of compressibility, compression index and coefficient of consolidation. However, the determination of <b>soil</b> <b>compressibility</b> characteristics in the labs is a cumbersome and time consuming process, {{especially in the case}} of fine grained soils. In the present study, an attempt has been made to estimate compression index as a function of soil index properties. Soil samples were collected from different Indian hydropower projects. The collected samples were subjected to laboratory investigations for the determination of geotechnical parameters namely liquid limits, plastic limits and compression indices. Based on experimental results, correlations between the soil index properties (liquid limit & plasticity index) and compression index were evaluated. An empirical model was developed to estimate the compression index as a function of liquid limit and plasticity index. The model results were compared with the actual compression index values, as determined by laboratory tests, and were found to be in good agreement. The compression index values for the collected samples were also determined using the available models in literature, and the results indicate that the present model can predict the <b>soil</b> <b>compressibility</b> more accurately...|$|E
40|$|By {{incorporating}} the nonlinear variation of a <b>soil’s</b> <b>compressibility</b> and permeability {{during the process}} of consolidation, an analytical solution for the radial consolidation of vertical drains has been developed for a general time-variable loading. The general solution was verified for the cases of instantaneous loading and ramp loading. Detailed solutions were further derived for two special loading schemes: multistage loading and preloading– unloading–reloading. The nonlinear consolidation behavior of a vertical drain subjected to these two types of loading schemes was then investigated by a parametric study. The results show that the loading rate, the ratio of the compressibility index to the permeability index (CdCk) and the initial stress state have a significant influence on the consolidation rate. A smaller value of CdCk a larger initial stress, or a fast loading rate always leads to a rapid consolidation rate.

The compressibility behaviour of lime-treated organic clay with varying amounts of chloride salts was studied at different curing periods.

Failure, in terms of bearing capacity can occur when pavements are constructed over such soft soils. When road pavements, which are constructed over soft soils, are subjected to cyclic traffic loading (dynamic in nature), rapid deterioration of the base layer material and progressive permanent deformation of the surface will occur. This not only reduces the serviceability of the pavement structure but also its design life.

40|$|Abstract: A {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} with laboratory normal devices to investigate the engineering property of coal ash mixed with various clay contents. By analyzing experimental data, some conclusions were made: It is helpful to improve the compaction effect and significantly reduce the consumption of the water needed in engineering by mixing the clay into coal ash. The shear strength of coal ash decreased slightly with increase of clay content. The shear strength of coal ash mixed with the 30 % clay content is nearly {{equal to that of}} pure coal ash. With the increase of clay content, the coefficients of compressibility a 1 - 2 have a little irregularly growth. It always belongs to medium <b>compressibility</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R
40|$|In situ {{measurements}} of <b>soil</b> and rock <b>compressibility</b> through radioactive marker techniques (RMT) are here discussed. Compressibility {{is the main}} parameter governing compaction of sediments undergoing stress state variations, particularly when fluid withdrawal is considered. Numerical analyses of land subsidence phenomena from underground fluid extraction are strictly linked to the material parameters adopted, and consequently the results are strongly affected by the compressibility values used in the mathematical model. It is here proved {{that the presence of}} a fully cased hole generates perturbations of the deformations in a large area around the borehole, even accepting an elastic behaviour of the surrounding rocks. Additionally, elasto-plasticity is taken into account to further confirm the statement...|$|R
