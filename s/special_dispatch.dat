6000|$|Philip of Spain, {{the husband}} of her sister Mary, {{was the first of}} these suitors. He had seen Elizabeth a good deal in England during his {{residence}} there, and had even taken her part in her difficulties with Mary, and had exerted his influence to have her released from her confinement. As soon as Mary died and Elizabeth was proclaimed, one of her first acts was, as was very proper, to send an embassador to Flanders to inform the bereaved husband of his loss. It is a curious illustration of the degree and kind of affection that Philip had borne to his departed wife, that immediately on receiving intelligence of her death by Elizabeth's embassador, he sent a <b>special</b> <b>dispatch</b> to his own embassador in London to make a proposal to Elizabeth to take him for her husband! ...|$|E

5000|$|Seeking to {{cut costs}} during the Recession of 1937, the newspaper's {{management}} decided to consolidate its foreign coverage under Laurence Hills, who had been appointed editor of the Paris Herald by Frank Munsey in 1920 and kept the paper profitable. But Hills had fascist sympathies—the Paris Herald was alone among American newspapers in having [...] "ad columns sprout(ing) with swastikas and fasces—and {{was more interested in}} cutting costs than producing journalism. [...] "It is no longer the desire even to attempt to run parallel with The New York Times in <b>special</b> <b>dispatches</b> from Europe," [...] Hills wrote in a memo to the Herald Tribunes foreign bureaus in late 1937. [...] "Crisp cables of human interest or humorous type cables are greatly appreciated. Big beats in Europe these days are not very likely." [...] The policy effectively led the Herald Tribune to surrender the edge in foreign reporting to its rival.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the area}} of language-based {{security}} programs written in typed high-level languages need to be translated into those written in typed low-level languages. This work is not trivial when type dispatch constructs are involved which are implemented with tag mechanism. This paper proposes a new type that can deal with a <b>special</b> type <b>dispatch</b> construct occurring in interface invokation of Java. A low-level language with this type is able to efficiently implement interface invokation in Java. This implementation approach is adopted in a Just-In-Time compiler with a typed low-level language as certifying language...|$|R
5000|$|Today, some {{sections}} of the base’s asphalt runway are still visible, as are several concrete tie-down pads. On November 16th 2016 a live air strike bomb was unearthed during construction entangled in the roots of a tree {{in what is now}} known as Frenchtown. The location was near the boundaries of the old base. A <b>special</b> crew <b>dispatched</b> by The 325th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Flight out of Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida determined that the course of action was to detonate the bomb in place to neutralize it and did so safely.|$|R

She visited Washington Navy Yard for the Peace Jubilee of 14 May-30 June 1899; New York City for the George Dewey celebration of 26-29 September; and Alexandria, Virginia, for the city's sesquicentennial on 10 October. From 7 November 1899 - 2 February 1900, she cruised to Venezuela to survey {{the mouth of the}} Orinoco River. On 27-28 May 1900, Dolphin anchored off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia, with President William McKinley on board to observe a total solar eclipse. She departed Washington, D.C. on 11 January 1902 to survey the southeast coast of Santo Domingo, then carried the Chief of the Bureau of Equipment from Havana for a tour of inspection of the coaling stations in the West Indies. She returned to Washington on 6 May.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} {{companies}} of special caçadores (<b>special</b> forces) are <b>dispatched</b> from the Portuguese Metropole to Angola in June 1960, mainly {{due to the}} Congo Crisis.

As he spoke fluent Russian, however, after a while it was {{considered}} more appropriate to employ his capabilities not at the battlefront, but elsewhere. He was first sent to Iranian Azerbaijan on a special mission, then in 1916, to Denmark and Sweden. Between 1917 and 1918, during the revolution years in Russia, he was stationed in Saint Petersburg (then Petrograd) and later in Moscow {{as a member of the}} <b>special</b> commission <b>dispatched</b> for the exchange of Ottoman-Russian Prisoners of War.|$|R

5000|$|The 2200 lb Van Wagoner {{automobile}} {{was built}} at the Century Motor Vehicle Company's plant in Syracuse. It apparently did win the endurance race on Long Island. A <b>special</b> <b>dispatch</b> to The Herald said: [...] "Automobiles were raced on Long Island today. Gasoline and steam vehicles of every size and many horse powers ran over 100 mi of smooth but dusty roads within a square, the diagonal of which was less than 12 mi. The linear measurement of a 100 mi within this square was accomplished {{by a series of}} angles and curves as curious as the outline of a South Sea island. Within this tract of land and roadway track of many sharp and obtuse curves nearly 100 motor cars whizzed, snorted and cavorted." [...] The idea of the race was to prove the greatest touring capacity of the motors. It was a [...] "non-stop" [...] contest and any stops made were penalized. The winner was decided by figuring percentage on the time, the number of stops, if any, and the weight and class of the machine. The prizes were blue, red, yellow and white ribbons.|$|E

50|$|Thousands of Muscovites {{came out}} to defend the White House (the Russian Federation's {{parliament}} and Yeltsin's office), the symbolic seat of Russian sovereignty at the time. The organizers tried but ultimately failed to arrest Yeltsin, who rallied opposition to the coup with speech-making atop a tank. The <b>special</b> forces <b>dispatched</b> by the coup leaders took up positions near the White House, but members refused to storm the barricaded building. The coup leaders also neglected to jam foreign news broadcasts, so many Muscovites watched it unfold live on CNN. Even the isolated Gorbachev was able to stay abreast of developments by tuning into BBC World Service on a small transistor radio.|$|R
5000|$|In response, The State Department <b>dispatched</b> <b>special</b> envoy Richard Fairbanks, who [...] "spoke with diplomats, {{intelligence}} officers and arms industry officials" [...] in targeted Arab {{countries as well}} as South Korea, Italy, Spain and Portugal. The State Department successfully dissuaded American allies from selling American arms to Iran on the tenet, created by Iran's association with Hezbollah, that Iran sponsors terrorism.|$|R

In February 1416, a <b>special</b> envoy was <b>dispatched</b> to inform Jogaila that the queen was seriously ill. Despite the news, Jogaila did not hurry back to Kraków. He reached the capital city only in May and Anna died after a few days. She was buried in Wawel Cathedral.|$|R

Under enormous pressure from the US, Fonseca and Quintero were quickly apprehended, but Félix Gallardo still enjoyed political protection.|$|R
25|$|Irrespective {{of their}} status, the Communist government's {{response}} to the Kielce atrocities was rapid. <b>Special</b> investigators were <b>dispatched</b> and military tribunals formed. Activities of the local authorities were investigated. However, only the local commander of Milicja Obywatelska {{was found guilty of}} inaction. Nine direct participants of the pogrom were sentenced to death; three were given lengthy prison sentences. Debate in Poland continues today whether the murderers were leftists or rightists. Who inspired the killings is not agreed upon or known.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first run}} of the Pony Express was {{scheduled}} for April 3, 1860. The mail pouch bound for the west, carrying [...] "49 letters, 5 private telegrams, and some papers for San Francisco and intermediate points", had missed a train connection and the superintendent of the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad had to order a <b>special</b> locomotive <b>dispatched</b> to deliver the pouch to St. Joseph. The mail arrived two hours late and, {{after a number of}} speeches were recited, set off for Sacramento. It took seventy-five ponies to make the first trip from Missouri to California. Each major city along the way celebrated as the Pony Express rider passed through. On April 14, 1860, at about 1 a.m., the Pony Express from St. Joseph arrived in San Francisco. The east-bound rider left San Francisco April 3 and made it to St. Josephs on April 13. The Pony Express was active.|$|R

Investigators soon identified Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo and his two close associates, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo and Rafael Caro Quintero, as the primary suspects in the kidnapping.

50|$|First {{encountered}} on 23 June 1941, the T-34 outclassed {{the existing}} Panzer III and IV. At {{the insistence of}} General Heinz Guderian, a <b>special</b> Panzerkommision was <b>dispatched</b> to the Eastern Front to assess the T-34. Among {{the features of the}} Soviet tank considered most significant were the sloping armor, which gave much improved shot deflection and also increased the effective armor thickness against penetration, the wide track, which improved mobility over soft ground, and the 76.2 mm gun, which had good armor penetration and fired an effective high-explosive round.|$|R

50|$|While the {{province}} hasn't witnessed the outright {{fighting in the}} last few years that has affected provinces like Helmand, there is a constant low level of tribal violence, accompanied by criminal and Taliban activity. The last serious fighting in {{the province}} took place in 2004, amid reports that then-Governor Muhammad Ali Jalali was collaborating with Taliban forces, and that the Taliban had effectively annexed eastern portions of the province. Jalali and many of his allied officials, were replaced and U.S. <b>Special</b> Forces were <b>dispatched</b> to fight the Taliban while the Pakistani forces fought with the Taliban's allies in neighbouring South Waziristan.|$|R
5000|$|After the MPLA debacle at Catengue, the Cubans {{became very}} aware of the South African {{intervention}}. On 4 November Castro decided to begin an intervention on an unprecedented scale: [...] "Operation Carlota". The same day, a first airplane with 100 heavy weapon specialists, which the MPLA had requested in September, left for Brazzaville, arriving in Luanda on 7 November. On November 9 the first 100 men of a contingent of a 652-strong battalion of elite Special Forces were flown in. The 100 specialists and 88 men of the <b>special</b> forces were <b>dispatched</b> immediately to the nearby front at Kifangondo. They assisted 850 FAPLA, 200 Katangans and one Soviet advisor.|$|R
2500|$|The officially pursued German {{rearmament}} {{began in}} 1935 under Adolf Hitler, {{contrary to the}} provisions of the Treaty of Versailles [...] the foundation of the post-World War I international order. Unable to prevent Hitler's remilitarization of the Rhineland, both the United Kingdom and France also pursued rearmament. Meanwhile, the German territorial expansion into central Europe began in earnest with the Anschluss of Austria in March 1938. Poland <b>dispatched</b> <b>special</b> diversionary groups to the disputed Zaolzie (Czech Silesia) area in hope of expediting the breakup of Czechoslovakia and regaining the territory. The Munich Agreement of 30 September 1938 was followed by Germany's incorporation of the Sudetenland. Faced with the threat of a total annexation of Czechoslovakia, the Western Powers endorsed the German partition of the country.|$|R
