40|$|Abstract: The {{phenomenon}} of vapor blockage (vapor lock) on LPG hose {{is one of}} major causes of fires and explosions on the gas stove system. Vapor blockage {{is very easy to}} occur during the liquid phase of the LPG flow along the hose. One way to prevent the liquid phase flow of LPG to the hose of the gas stove is by adding a swirling nozzle on the regulator. Different from other type of nozzles, a swirling nozzle has a <b>swirling</b> <b>chamber</b> in it which can generate a vortex effect, so that the atomization process is better. This study is focused to experimentally investigate the <b>swirling</b> <b>chamber</b> volume relationship with the LPG mass flow rate, discharge coefficient (CD), flow coefficient (KD), Reynolds Number and the swirling flow number. Results of experiments showed that the volume of the <b>swirling</b> <b>chamber</b> in <b>swirling</b> nozzle gives effects on the LPG mass flow rate through the swirling nozzle. It can be confirmed that the larger of <b>swirling</b> <b>chamber</b> volume, the greater the mass flow rate through the swirling nozzle. The increase of mass flow rate causes the discharge coefficient (CD), flow coefficient (KD), the Reynolds number and flow number also increase.

40|$|Three {{devices for}} {{treating}} contaminated water using a cavitating vortex {{have been developed}} and tested. The first device uses stationary twin volute casings to generate cavitating vortices. Observation of the collisions among the opposing counter-rotating vortices revealed that their end portions whirl, that the vortices never collide head-on, and that they eventually separate into several small vortex strings. The second device is simply half of the first device. A single volute casing is used, and the vortex flow collides with a solid wall. The third device uses a centrifugal impeller and a circular <b>swirling</b> <b>chamber</b> to generate a cavitating vortex. A high absolute circumferential velocity at the impeller exit induces a strong vortex in the chamber. The vortex cavitation is smoother than {{in the first two}} devices, and the end portion of the vortex whirls {{in the same manner as}} that generated in the first device. Installation of an orifice at the exit of the <b>swirling</b> <b>chamber</b> reduced the diameter of the flow passage and thereby accelerated the rotating and axial flow velocities.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{reports the}} latest investigations about a miniaturized hybrid energy power source, compatible with thermal/electrical conversion, by a thermo-photovoltaic cell, and potentially useful for civil and space applications. The converter is a thermally-conductive emitting parallelepiped element {{and the basic}} idea is to heat up its emitting surfaces by means of combustion, occurred in <b>swirling</b> <b>chambers,</b> integrated inside the device, and/or by the sun, which may work simultaneously or alternatively to the combustion. The current upgrades consist in examining whether the device might fulfill specific design constraints, adopting hydrocarbons-feeding.

The project’s constraints are: 1) emitting surface dimensions fixed to 30 × 30 mm, 2) surface peak temperature T > 1000 K and the relative ∆T < 100 K (during the combustion mode), 3) the highest possible delivered power to the ambient, and 4) thermal efficiency greater than 20 % when works with solar energy. To this end, a 5 connected <b>swirling</b> <b>chambers</b> configuration (3 mm of diameter), with 500 W of injected chemical power, stoichiometric conditions and detailed chemistry, has been adopted.

5|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of sintered silicon nitride is in automobile industry as a material for engine parts.

In spark-ignition engines, silicon nitride is used for rocker arm pads for lower wear, turbocharger for lower inertia and less engine lag, and in exhaust gas control valves for increased acceleration. As examples of production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered silicon nitride turbochargers made annually.|$|R
50|$|Pressure-swirl {{spray nozzles}} are {{high-performance}} (small drop size) devices with one configuration shown. The stationary core induces a rotary fluid motion which causes the swirling of the fluid in the <b>swirl</b> <b>chamber.</b> A film is {{discharged from the}} perimeter of the outlet orifice producing a characteristic hollow cone spray pattern. Air or other surrounding gas is drawn inside the <b>swirl</b> <b>chamber</b> to form an air core within the swirling liquid. Many configurations of fluid inlets are used to produce this hollow cone pattern depending on the nozzle capacity and materials of construction. The uses of this nozzle include evaporative cooling and spray drying.|$|E
50|$|This {{spray pattern}} is a {{circular}} ring of liquid. The pattern {{is achieved by}} the use of an inlet orifice tangential to a cylindrical <b>swirl</b> <b>chamber</b> that is open at one end. The circular orifice exit has a diameter smaller than the <b>swirl</b> <b>chamber.</b> The whirling liquid results in a circular shape; the center of the ring is hollow.Hollow cone nozzles are best for applications requiring good atomization of liquids at low pressures or when quick heat transfer is needed. These nozzles also feature large and unobstructed flow passages, which provide a relatively high resistance to clogging. Hollow cone nozzles provide the smallest drop size distributions. The relative range of drop sizes tends to be narrower than other hydraulic styles.|$|E

40|$|This work reports results {{related to}} the “EU-FP 7 -HRC-Power” project aiming at {{developing}} micro-meso hybrid sources of power. One {{of the goals of}} the project is to achieve surface temperatures up to more than 1000 K, with a ∆T ≤ 100 K, in order to be compatible with a thermal/electrical conversion by thermo-photovoltaic cells. The authors investigate how to reach that goal adopting <b>swirling</b> <b>chambers</b> integrated in a thermally-conductive and emitting element. The converter consists of a small parallelepiped brick inside two separated <b>swirling</b> meso-combustion <b>chambers,</b> which heat up the parallelepiped, emitting material by the combustion of H 2 and air at ambient pressure. The overall dimension is of the order of cm. Nine combustion simulations have been carried out assuming detailed chemistry, several length/diameter ratios (Z/D = 3, 5 and 11) and equivalence ratios (0. 4, 0. 7 and 1); all are at 400 W of injected chemical power. Among the most important results are the converter surfaces temperatures, the heat loads, provided to the environment, and the chemical efficiency. The high chemical efficiency, h > 99. 9 %, is due to the relatively long average gas residence time coupled with the fairly good mixing due to the swirl motion and the impinging air/fuel jets that provide heat and radicals to the flame...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the leading edge has the most {{critical}} heat transfer area of a gas turbine blade. The highest heat transfer rates on the airfoil can always {{be found on the}} stagnation region of the leading edge. In order to further improve the gas turbine thermal efficiency the development of more advanced internal cooling configurations at leading edge is very necessary. As {{the state of the art}} leading edge cooling configuration a concave channel with multi inline jets has been widely used in most of the blades. However, this kind of configuration also generates strong spent flow, which shifts the impingement off the stagnation point and weakens the impingement heat transfer. In order to solve this problem a new internal cooling configuration using double <b>swirl</b> <b>chambers</b> in gas turbine leading edge has been developed and introduced in this paper. The double <b>swirl</b> <b>chambers</b> cooling (DSC) technology is introduced by the authors and contributes a significant enhancement of heat transfer due to the generation of two anti-rotated swirls. In DSC-cooling, the reattachment of the swirl flows always occurs in the middle of the chamber, which results in a linear impingement effect. Compared with the reference standard impingement cooling configuration this new cooling system provides a much more uniform heat transfer distribution in the chamber axial direction and also provides a much higher heat transfer rate. In this study, the influences of different geometrical parameters e. g. merging ratio of two cylinder channels, the jet inlet hole configurations and radius of blunt protuberances in DSC have been investigated numerically. The results show that in the DSC cooling system the jet inlet hole configurations have large influences on the thermal performance. The rectangular inlet holes, especially those with higher aspect ratios, show much better heat transfer enhancement than the round inlet holes. However, as the price for it the total pressure drop is increased. Using blunt protuberances instead of sharp edges in the DSC cooling can improve the heat transfer enhancement and reduce the total pressure drop...|$|R

50|$|It {{consists}} of a spherical chamber located in the cylinder head and separated from the engine cylinder by a tangential throat. About 50% of the air enters the <b>swirl</b> <b>chamber</b> during the compression stroke of the engine, producing a swirl.After combustion, the products return through the same throat to the main cylinder at much higher velocity. So more heat loss to walls of the passage takes place. This type of chamber finds application in engines in which fuel control and engine stability {{are more important than}} fuel economy. These are Ricardo chambers, named after the inventor, Sir Harry Ricardo.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the heat}} and {{pressure}} of combustion is applied to one specific point on the piston as it exits the precombustion chamber or <b>swirl</b> <b>chamber,</b> such engines are less suited to high specific power outputs (such as turbocharging or tuning) than direct injection diesels.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the performance of}} an atomizer coupled with a substrate which produces metal powder and spray forming materials simultaneous in the spray chamber. Ultra fine metal powders are produced from this process. The melt is atomized by a twin-fluid atomizer with internal mixing mechanisms. The molten spray injected from the <b>swirling</b> <b>chamber</b> of the atomizer is then impinged upon the substrate to form the two phase impinging flow. The deposition rate of the molten spray on the substrate {{is controlled by the}} diameter of the substrate, the height of the substrate ring and the distance of the substrate from the outlet of the atomizer. This in turn determines the powder production rate of the spraying processes. Experimental results indicate that the deposition rate of the spray forming material decreases as the distance between the substrate and the atomizer increases. For example, the deposition rate decreases from 48 % to 19 % as the substrate is placed at a distance from 20 cm to 40 cm. On the other hand, the metal powder production rate and its particle size increases as the substrate is placed far away from the atomizer. The production of metal powder with mean particle size as low as 3 μ m level has been achieved, a level which is not achievable by the conventional gas atomization processes...|$|R
25|$|Throughout the 1950s {{there was}} an {{increasing}} demand for a diesel-engined Land Rover. Diesel technology had improved, making small-capacity high-speed engines practical. Diesel power had also become prominent in industrial and agricultural uses throughout the world, and fleet users of Land Rovers were often in the situation where their Land Rovers were the only petrol-engined vehicles in their fleet, making spares, servicing and fuel supply more complex. The Rover Motor Company was in talks with Standard-Triumph in 1954, {{with the possibility of}} a merger. Standard were Britain's pioneers of road-going small diesel engines with the 20C engine fitted to Ferguson tractors and the Standard Vanguard car (Britain's first diesel car). Rover engineers were able to study Standard's diesel designs as part of these. The merger was called off, but Rover had gained vital experience and knowledge in developing small diesel engines. The result was a wet-liner 4-cylinder engine. Fuel injection equipment was from CAV, and the engine used Ricardo's Comet <b>swirl</b> <b>chambers,</b> but with Rover-developed dimples to produce quieter and smoother running. Heater plugs were fitted to each combustion chamber to improve starting. The engine was launched in the Land Rover in 1957. The vehicle had to have an extra 2inches let into the chassis in the engine bay to enable the new engine to fit. The engine's power output and speed range was close enough to the existing petrol engine to allow the same transmission unit to be used on all vehicles.|$|R

40|$|To {{provide an}} {{overview}} of {{the current state of the}} art of heat transfer augmentation schemes employed for internal cooling of turbine blades and components, results from an extensive literature review are presented with data from internal cooling channels, both with and without rotation. According to this survey, a very small number of existing investigations consider the use of combination devices for internal passage heat transfer augmentation. Examples are rib turbulators, pin fins, and dimples together, a combination of pin fins and dimples, and rib turbulators and pin fins in combination. The results of such studies are compared with data obtained prior to 2003 without rotation influences. Those data are comprised of heat transfer augmentation results for internal cooling channels, with rib turbulators, pin fins, dimpled surfaces, surfaces with protrusions, <b>swirl</b> <b>chambers,</b> or surface roughness. This comparison reveals that all of the new data, obtained since 2003, collect within the distribution of globally averaged data obtained from investigations conducted prior to 2003 (without rotation influences). The same conclusion in regard to data distributions is also reached in regard to globally averaged thermal performance parameters as they vary with friction factor ratio. These comparisons, made on the basis of such judgment criteria, lead to the conclusion that improvements in our ability to provide better spatially-averaged thermal protection have been minimal since 2003. When rotation is present, existing investigations provide little evidence of overall increases or decreases in overall thermal performance characteristics with rotation, at any value of rotation number, buoyancy parameter, density ratio, or Reynolds number. Comparisons between existing rotating channel experimental data and the results obtained prior to 2003, without rotation influences, also show that rotation has little effect on overall spatially-averaged thermal performance as a function of friction factor...|$|R
