50|$|John Clark Sheehan (23 September 1915 - 21 March 1992) was an American {{organic chemist}} whose work on {{synthetic}} penicillin led to tailor-made {{forms of the}} drug. After nine {{years of hard work}} at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.), he became the first to discover a practical method for synthesizing penicillin V. While achieving total synthesis, Sheehan also produced an intermediate compound, 6-aminopenicillanic acid, {{which turned out to be}} the foundation of hundreds of kinds of synthetic penicillin. Dr. Sheehan's research on synthetic penicillin paved the way for the development of customized forms of the lifesaving antibiotic that target specific bacteria. Over the four decades he worked at M.I.T., Sheehan came to hold over 30 patents, including the invention of ampicillin, a commonly used <b>semi-synthetic</b> <b>penicillin</b> that is taken orally rather than by injection.

40|$|Vancomycin and {{ampicillin}} resistance in clinical Enterococcus faecium strains has {{developed in the}} past decade. Failure to adhere to strict infection control {{to prevent the spread}} of these pathogens has been well established. New data implicate the use of specific classes of antimicrobial agents in the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

Control of VRE will require better understanding of the mechanisms by which different classes of drugs promote gastrointestinal colonization. Enterococci are important nosocomial pathogens (1, 2). Their emergence in the past two decades is in many respects attributable to their resistance to many commonly used antimicrobial agents (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, cephalosporins, clindamycin, the <b>semi-synthetic</b> <b>penicillins</b> nafcillin and oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) (3).

Penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0 · 1 μg or less of amoxycillin/ml.

Penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. The new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. After oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine.

50|$|Penicillin is {{actively}} excreted, and about 80% of a penicillin dose is cleared {{from the body}} within {{three to four hours}} of administration. Indeed, during the early penicillin era, the drug was so scarce and so highly valued that it became common to collect the urine from patients being treated, so that the penicillin in the urine could be isolated and reused. This was not a satisfactory solution, so researchers looked for a way to slow penicillin excretion. They hoped to find a molecule that could compete with penicillin for the organic acid transporter responsible for excretion, such that the transporter would preferentially excrete the competing molecule and the penicillin would be retained. The uricosuric agent probenecid proved to be suitable. When probenecid and penicillin are administered together, probenecid competitively inhibits the excretion of penicillin, increasing penicillin's concentration and prolonging its activity. Eventually, the advent of mass-production techniques and <b>semi-synthetic</b> <b>penicillins</b> resolved the supply issues, so this use of probenecid declined. Probenecid is still useful, however, for certain infections requiring particularly high concentrations of penicillins.|$|R

Penicillins have been used in the treatment of urinary infections since 1945, when Stewart first used benzylpenicillin G.

Recently amoxicillin, a <b>semi-synthetic</b> <b>penicillin</b> with an antibacterial spectrum similar to that of ampicillin, has become available.

The ester carbonyl vibration of the acyl-enzyme is ascribed {{to a small}} band between 1710 and 1720 cm- 1, whereas a much larger band at approx. 1640 cm- 1 is ascribed to a perturbation {{in the structure of}} the enzyme, which occurs on acylation. The protein perturbation has been interpreted as occurring in beta-sheet. The acyl-enzyme formed with benzylpenicillin shows the lowest ester carbonyl vibration frequency, which is interpreted to mean that the carbonyl oxygen is the most strongly hydrogen-bonded in the oxyanion hole of the antibiotics studied. The <b>semi-synthetic</b> <b>penicillin</b> cloxacillin is apparently less well organized in the active site and shows two partially overlapping ester carbonyl bands. The penicillin acyl-enzyme has been shown to deacylate more slowly than that formed with cloxacillin. This demonstrates that the natural benzylpenicillin forms a more optimized and better-bonded acyl-enzyme and that this in turn leads to the stabilization of the acyl-enzyme required for effective action in the inhibition of PBP 2 x. The energetics of hydrogen bonding in the several acyl-enzymes is discussed and comparison is made with carbonyl absorption frequencies of model ethyl esters in a range of organic solvents.

Multivariate calibration has been used to reduce times of analysis in multicomponent systems, and this is the approach of this work. Three multivariate calibration methods are compared for prediction of the concentrations of the components present in the enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin. UV spectra and their first-order derivatives were used as input data for the models. Results showed that all methods (SPA,PCR and PLS) had similar performances for this system.

Due to significant changes in microbial genetic ecology, {{as a result of}} indiscriminate use of anti-microbials, the spread of anti-microbial resistance is now a global problem. Materials and Methods: Out of 276 culture positive samples, 56 samples of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined and 10 different types of specimen were collected. Microbial sensitivity testing was done using disk diffusion test with Pseudomonas species NCTC 10662, as per CLSI guidelines. Results: The highest number of Pseudomonas infections was found in urine, followed by pus and sputum. Pseudomonas species demonstrated marked resistance against monotherapy of penicillins, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines and macrolides. Only combination drugs like Ticarcillin &#x 002 B; Clavulanic acid, Piperacillin &#x 002 B; Tazobactum, Cefoperazone &#x 002 B; Sulbactum, Cefotaxime &#x 002 B; Sulbactum, Ceftriaxome &#x 002 B; Sulbactum and monotherapy of amikacin showed higher sensitivity to Pseudomonas infections; however, the maximum sensitivity was shown by the Carbapenems.

Recovery was complete upon discontinuation of the drug. The clustering {{of these cases}} and the high incidence (5 of 5) of side effects are highly unusual, and suggest that the frequency of nafcillin reactions might be higher than previously suspected. It is assumed that all penicillinase-resistant <b>semi-synthetic</b> <b>penicillins</b> are equally effective in treating infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus [1, 2].

Of the major side effects, rash, urticaria, fever, allergic interstitial nephritis, hepatic toxicity, and hematologic toxicity {{in the form of}} reversible granulocytopenia have been commented upon in the literature [3 - 10]. Nafcillin, 6 -(2 -ethoxy-l-naphthalmido) penicillanic acid, has been preferred by some clinicians over methicillin and oxacillin, because its use may be associated with a lower incidence of side effects, particularly nephropathy [11]. Furthermore, in one study nafcillin offered better synergistic activity than other penicillinase-resistant penicillins with an aminoglycoside when tested against the enterococci [12]. This report describes an unusually high occurrence of untoward reactions due to nafcillin observed by us at Yale-New Haven Hospital. During the months of July and August of 1976, five patients, four of whom were seen and followed by the Infectious Disease Section, received high dose intravenous nafcillin for proven or presumed staphylococcal infections. All five subsequently developed various drug reactions, necessitating discontinuation of nafcillin in four of the patients. To the best of our knowledge, no other patient received nafcillin at our institution during this period...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in general practice. Six hundred and forty-seven infections of the {{respiratory}} tract. urinary tract and the skin and soft tissues in 646 patients were treated with oral Magnapen (250 mg ampicillin + 250 mg flucloxacillin) four times each day. An overall success rate of 94 % was achieved. The main side-effect was diarrhoea causing 2 · 5 % ofpatients to discontinue therapy. These results demonstrate the outstanding value of Magnapen in treating a wide variety of infections in general practice. differences of opinion exist with regard to the general level of usage. However, in patients suffering from bacterial infections of any reasonable severity, this is the treatment of choice. Persistent infection, particularly if recurrent, can at best be inconvenient, painful and result in time lost from work or school. At worst it can mean admission to hospital, long-standing disability or death. When a systemic antibiotic is to be given to a patient an agent should be chosen which has an appropriate spectrum of activity to cover all likely pathogens, good absorption giving high serum and tissue levels, freedom from side-effects, freedom from toxicity to vital organs and a presentation readily acceptable to the patient with a simple dosage regime. The <b>semi-synthetic</b> <b>penicillins</b> come close to the ideal when measured against these criteria. In general practice the choice is usually made before bacteriological results are available on the basis of clinical considerations. Magnapen (ampicillin 250 mg + fiucloxacillin 250 mg) offers a logical choice in patients where there is uncertainty about the likely pathogen or when 0300 - 0605 / 80 / 060417 - 07 $ 02 · 00 e Cambridge Medical Publications Limite...|$|R
40|$|The enzyme {{penicillin}} acylase (penicillin amidohydrolase EC 3. 5. 1. 11) catalyses the cleavage of the amide bond in the benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) side-chain to produce phenylacetic acid and 6 -aminopenicillanic acid (6 -APA). The enzyme {{is of great}} pharmaceutical importance, as the product 6 -APA is {{the starting point for}} the synthesis of many <b>semi-synthetic</b> <b>penicillin</b> antibiotics. Studies have shown that the enzyme is specific for hydrolysis of phenylacetamide derivatives, but is more tolerant of features {{in the rest of the}} substrate. It is this property that has led to many other applications for the enzyme, and greater knowledge of the enzyme's structure and specificity could facilitate engineering of the enzyme, enhancing its potential for chemical and industrial applications. An extensive study of the binding of a series of phenylacetic acid derivatives has been carried out. A measure of the relative degree of inhibition of the enzyme by each of the compounds has been obtained using a competitive inhibition assay, and the structures of a number of these complexes have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The structures reveal a clear rationale for the observed kinetic results, but show also that some of the ligands cause a conformational change within the binding pocket. This change can generally be understood in terms of the size and orientation of the ligand within the active site. The results reveal that ligand binding in {{penicillin acylase}} is facilitated by certain amino acid residues that can adopt two distinct, energetically favourable positions in order to accommodate a variety of compounds within the active site. The structures of these complexes provide evidence for conformational changes in the substrate-binding region that may act as a switch in the mechanism of autocatalytic processing of this enzyme. 9116...|$|E
40|$|The use of immobilized enzymes in the {{analytical}} determination of enzyme substrates, inhibitors and activators has been examined using, {{for the majority}} of the work, heat sensors to monitor the chemical reactions occurring. The sensitivity of determination of a wide range of enzyme substrates by such means has been substantially improved over similar, previous reported, work by optimization of a number of relevant parameters (particularly in the choice, and dimensions, of the enzyme support material). Reproducibility of the results in most cases appeared excellent, even over relatively long time periods. A brief study has also been conducted using other types of transducers. Novel techniques for {{the analytical}} determination of immobilized enzyme inhibitors and activators have been developed which, although undoubtedly capable of improvement, already show considerable promise. In particular, no reports occur in the literature concerning the use of immobilized enzymes for the quantitative determination of reversible enzyme inhibitors, or enzyme activators. Using these techniques, the determination of enzyme substrates such as penicillin G, urea, hydrogen peroxide, glucose, sucrose, lactose and uric acid have been accomplished, 0. 5 cm 3 of a 2 x 10 - 5 M solution often being analytically determinable. Enzyme inhibitors (such as Hg 2 +, Cu 2 +, caffeine and certain other alkaloids) and activators (such as Cu 2 + and Zn 2 +) have also been determined, in certain cases in concentrations as low as 10 - 6 - 10 - 7 mol dm- 3. Additionally, other uses of the combination of immobilized enzymes with thermal detection systems, such as the rapid determination of the overall enthalpies of hydrolysis of urea and penicillinase-sensitive semi-synthetic penicillins have been developed which yield rapid and highly reproducible measurements in an area where little or no data appears in the literature. A correlation has been established between the overall enthalpy of hydrolysis of a <b>semi-synthetic</b> <b>penicillin,</b> and the nature of the side-chain in the 6 -amino position of the penicillin. A strong correlation between the relative inhibitory powers of known anti-cholinesterase compounds on soluble and glass-immobilized cholinesterase enzymes has also been demonstrated, suggesting the possibility of using techniques described in this thesis as a rapid initial screening test for the pharmacological activity of new anti-cholinesterase drugs. <p...|$|E
40|$|Background:Background: Patients {{hospitalized with}} Staphylococcus aureus {{bacteraemia}} have an unacceptably high mortality rate. Literature available {{to date has}} shown that timely selection of the most appropriate antibacterial may reduce mortality. One tool that may help with this selection is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that distinguishes methicillin (meticillin) -resistant S. aureus (MRSA) from methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) in less than 1 hour. To date, no information is available evaluating {{the impact of this}} PCR technique on clinical or economic outcomes. Abstract: Objective:Objective: To evaluate the effect of a rapid PCR assay on mortality and economics compared with traditional empiric therapy, using a literature-derived model. Abstract: Methods:Methods: A literature search for peer-reviewed European (EU) and US publications regarding treatment regimens, outcomes and costs was conducted. Information detailing the rates of infection, as well as the specificity and sensitivity of a rapid PCR assay (Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture PCR™) were obtained from the peer-reviewed literature. Sensitivity analysis varied the prevalence rate of MRSA from 5 % to 80 %, while threshold analysis was applied to the cost of the PCR test. Hospital and testing resource consumption were valued with direct medical costs, adjusted to year 2009 values. Adjusted life-years were determined using US and WHO life tables. The cost-effectiveness ratio was defined as the cost per life-year saved. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated to determine the additional cost necessary to produce additional effectiveness. All analyses were performed using TreeAge Software (2008). Abstract: Results:Results: The mean mortality rates were 23 % for patients receiving empiric vancomycin subsequently switched to <b>semi-synthetic</b> <b>penicillin</b> (SSP) for MSSA, 36 % for patients receiving empiric vancomycin treatment for MRSA, 59 % for patients receiving empiric SSP subsequently switched to vancomycin for MRSA and 12 % for patients receiving empiric SSP for MSSA. Furthermore, with an MRSA prevalence of 30 %, the numbers of patients needed to test in order to save one life were 14 and 16 compared with empiric vancomycin and SSP, respectively. The absolute mortality difference for MRSA prevalence rates of 80 % and 5 % favoured the PCR testing group at 2 % and 10 %, respectively, compared with empiric vancomycin and 18 % and 1 %, respectively, compared with empiric SSP. In the EU, the cost-effectiveness ratios for empiric vancomycin- and SSP-treated patients were &U 20 AC; 695 and &U 20 AC; 687 per life-year saved, respectively, compared with &U 20 AC; 636 per life-year saved for rapid PCR testing. In the US, the cost-effectiveness ratio was $US 898 per life-year saved for empiric vancomycin and $US 820 per life-year saved for rapid PCR testing. ICERs demonstrated dominance of the PCR test in all instances. Threshold analysis revealed that PCR testing would be less costly overall, even at greatly inflated assay prices. Abstract: Conclusion:Conclusion: Rapid PCR testing for MRSA appears to have the potential to reduce mortality rates while being less costly than empiric therapy in the EU and US, across a wide range of MRSA prevalence rates and PCR test costs. cost-effectiveness, diagnostic-assays, methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-infections, treatment, staphylococcal-infections, treatment...|$|E
40|$|Penicillin acylase (penicillin amidohydrolase, EC 3. 5. 1. 11) {{is widely}} {{distributed}} among microorganisms, including bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungi. It {{is used on}} an industrial scale {{for the production of}} 6 -aminopenicillanic acid, the starting material for the synthesis of <b>semi-synthetic</b> <b>penicillins.</b> Its in vivo role remains unclear, however, and the observation that expression of the Escherichia coli enzyme in vivo is regulated by both temperature and phenylacetic acid has prompted speculation that the enzyme could be involved in the assimilation of aromatic compounds as carbon sources in the organism's free-living mode. The mature E. coli enzyme is a periplasmic 80 K heterodimer of A and B chains (209 and 566 amino acids, respectively) synthesized as a single cytoplasmic precursor containing a 26 -amino-acid signal sequence to direct export to the cytoplasm and a 54 -amino-acid spacer between the A and B chains which may influence the final folding of the chains. The N-terminal serine of the B chain reacts with phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, which is consistent with a catalytic role for the serine hydroxyl group. Modifying this serine to a cysteine inactivates the enzyme, whereas threonine, arginine or glycine substitution prevents in vivo processing of the enzyme, indicating that this must be an important recognition site for cleavage. Here we report the crystal structure of penicillin acylase at 1. 9 A resolution. Our analysis shows that the environment of the catalytically active N-terminal serine of the B chain contains no adjacent histidine equivalent to that found in the serine proteases. The nearest base to the hydroxyl of this serine is its own alpha-amino group, which may act by a new mechanism to endow the enzyme with its catalytic properties. 9116...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Penicillin G acylase of Escherichia coli (PGA Ec) is {{a commercially}} {{valuable}} enzyme for which efficient bacterial expression {{systems have been}} developed. The enzyme {{is used as a}} catalyst for the hydrolytic production of β-lactam nuclei or for the synthesis of <b>semi-synthetic</b> <b>penicillins</b> such as ampicillin, amoxicillin and cephalexin. To become a mature, periplasmic enzyme, the inactive prepropeptide of PGA has to undergo complex processing that begins in the cytoplasm (autocatalytic cleavage), continues at crossing the cytoplasmic membrane (signal sequence removing), and it is completed in the periplasm. Since there are reports on impressive cytosolic expression of bacterial proteins in Pichia, we have cloned the leader-less gene encoding PGA Ec in this host and studied yeast production capacity and enzyme authenticity. Results Leader-less pga gene encoding PGA Ec under the control of AOX 1 promoter was cloned in Pichia pastoris X- 33. The intracellular overproduction of heterologous PGA Ec (hPGA Ec) was evaluated in a stirred 10 litre bioreactor in high-cell density, fed batch cultures using different profiles of transient phases. Under optimal conditions, the average volumetric activity of 25900 U l - 1 was reached. The hPGA Ec was purified, characterized and compared with the wild-type PGA Ec. The α-subunit of the hPGA Ec formed in the cytosol was processed aberrantly resulting in two forms with C- terminuses extended to the spacer peptide. The enzyme exhibited modified traits: the activity of the purified enzyme was reduced to 49 %, the ratios of hydrolytic activities with cephalexin, phenylacetamide or 6 -nitro- 3 -phenylacetylamidobenzoic acid (NIPAB) to penicillin G increased and the enzyme showed a better synthesis/hydrolysis ratio for the synthesis of cephalexin. Conclusions Presented results provide useful data regarding fermentation strategy, intracellular biosynthetic potential, and consequences of the heterologous expression of PGA Ec in P. pastoris X- 33.
