On the other hand, let the poor labour to provide things honest in the sight of all men; and so, with diligence in their several employments, live soberly, righteously, and godlily in this present world, that they may obtain that glorious reward promised in the Gospel to the poor, I mean the kingdom of Heaven.|$|E
25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>our</b> father {{divided the}} kingdom between us, {{both you and}} I are held to share the land and its produce with our magnates, with whose help our forefathers possessed the lost land and repulsed the Arabs.

Frequently cited examples of Formosan languages are given below, but the list should not be considered exhaustive.|$|E

25|$|A {{proposition}} {{was made}} by me that <b>since</b> <b>our</b> books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the inquiries, it might be convenient {{for us to have}} them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.|$|E
25|$|On further reflection, the Meditator {{realizes that}} even simple {{things can be}} doubted. Omnipotent God could make even our {{conception}} of mathematics false. One might argue that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, <b>since</b> <b>our</b> imperfect senses {{would not have been}} created by a perfect being.|$|E
25|$|Allergic {{diseases}} {{are caused by}} inappropriate immunological responses to harmless antigens driven by a TH2-mediated immune response. Many bacteria and viruses elicit a TH1-mediated immune response, which down-regulates TH2 responses. The first proposed mechanism of action of the hygiene hypothesis was that insufficient stimulation of the TH1 arm {{of the immune system}} leads to an overactive TH2 arm, which in turn leads to allergic disease. In other words, individuals living in too sterile an environment are not exposed to enough pathogens to keep the immune system busy. <b>Since</b> <b>our</b> bodies evolved to deal with a certain level of such pathogens, when they are not exposed to this level, the immune system will attack harmless antigens and thus normally benign microbial objects—like pollen—will trigger an immune response.|$|E

25|$|A third {{argument}} for incompatibilism was formulated by Carl Ginet in the 1960s and has received much {{attention in the}} modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we {{have no control over}} {{the events of the past}} that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the consequences of them. <b>Since</b> <b>our</b> present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the consequence argument. Peter van Inwagen remarks that C. D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Suppose, to the contrary, {{that there}} is a function, f, on the natural numbers with f(n+1) an element of f(n) for each n. Define S = {f(n): n a natural number}, the range of f, which can be seen to be a set from the axiom schema of replacement. Applying the axiom of {{regularity}} to S, let B be an element of S which is disjoint from S. By the definition of S, B must be f(k) for some natural number k. However, we are given that f(k) contains f(k+1) which is also an element of S. So f(k+1) is in the intersection of f(k) and S. This contradicts {{the fact that they are}} disjoint sets. <b>Since</b> <b>our</b> supposition led to a contradiction, there must not be any such function, f.|$|E
25|$|In October 1980, {{the dozen}} or so {{erstwhile}} nuns held their first fundraiser, a bingo game and Salsa dance that was well-attended {{in large part because of}} the write-up in The San Francisco Chronicle by Herb Caen the same day, who printed their organization name, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. The benefit was for San Francisco's Metropolitan Community Church Cuban Refugee Program, and it netted $1,500 ($ in 2009). The Sisters began making regular appearances at Castro events that focused on sexual tolerance or provided a showcase for drag. They also developed a mission statement:The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence is a leading-edge Order of queer nuns. <b>Since</b> <b>our</b> first appearance in San Francisco on Easter Sunday, 1979, the Sisters have devoted ourselves to community service, ministry and outreach to those on the edges, and to promoting human rights, respect for diversity and spiritual enlightenment. We believe all people have a right to express their unique joy and beauty and we use humor and irreverent wit to expose the forces of bigotry, complacency and guilt that chain the human spirit.|$|E

500|$|Our Friends in the North {{has been}} invoked on several {{occasions}} as a comparison when similar drama programmes have been screened on British television.

McCartney recalled, [...] "We got better and better and other groups started coming to watch us.

[...] The song was often played by the group, once being played for 90 minutes non-stop, with group members walking off stage to wash and drink before returning. Sutcliffe wrote a letter to his mother saying, [...] "We have improved a thousand-fold <b>since</b> <b>our</b> arrival and Allan Williams, who is here at the moment, tells us that there is no group in Liverpool to touch us." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1976, Robert Christgau {{wrote an}} article titled [...] "Yes, There Is a Rock-Critic Establishment (But Is That Bad for Rock?)".

Christgau also concedes that [...] "Because we are all self-taught (of necessity, <b>since</b> <b>our</b> academy is as yet informal), even the best of our work has the faults of autodidacticism: eccentricity, incompleteness, self-indulgence. The worst of our work, meanwhile, has the faults of drivel. ... Yet I read on, as much from inclination as from duty, and find that a fair portion of what is bad, like some strains of 'bad' rock and roll, has the sloppy appeal of all open, democratic phenomena." [...] Christgau later accused Rolling Stone of promoting a [...] "boring rock-as-idealism myth" [...] and [...] "claiming suzerainty over the music ever since" [...] the magazine was founded in 1967.|$|E
