5|$|Kate Farrar {{was interviewed}} by {{investigators}} on October 26. She stated that on the night she had woken up to find the fire already burning. Seeing smoke <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> her room, she opened the bedroom door and called to her brother, then {{closed the door and}} placed the hang-up 9-1-1 call that alerted police. She then crawled out of her bedroom window to escape the fire.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, the {{construction}} process {{began with the}} sinking of the first caisson for the tower into the bedrock. In April, construction began on the foundation below the Chicago River. In July 2005, water from the river began <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> the building site, through crevices in a corner where the foundation wall meets the Wabash Avenue Bridge. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the water side. After several other failed attempts to correct the problem, they drove a steel plate next to the gap and filled the space between with concrete after digging it out.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt {{ordered the}} statue to be {{transferred}} to the National Park Service (NPS). In 1937, the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe's Island. With the Army's departure, the NPS began to transform the island into a park. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) demolished most of the old buildings, regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island, and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear. The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue, temporarily removing the rays from the statue's halo so their rusted supports could be replaced. Rusted cast-iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete; the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced, as well. Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> the pedestal. The statue was closed to the public from May until December 1938.|$|E

50|$|Although all {{water that}} enters pit {{workings}} originates from atmospheric precipitation, the miner distinguishes between surface water and groundwater. Surface water enters the pit through {{openings in the}} mine at {{the surface of the}} ground, such as tunnel portals or shaft entrances. During heavy rain, water <b>seeps</b> <b>into</b> the earth and forms ground water when it meets layers of impervious rock. Pit water is mainly interstitial water and groundwater that <b>seeps</b> <b>into</b> the mine workings.|$|R
5|$|The continual warring {{with the}} Cholas {{exhausted}} both empires, giving their subordinates {{the opportunity to}} rebel. In the decades after Vikramaditya VI's death in 1126, the empire steadily decreased in size as their powerful feudatories expanded in autonomy and territorial command. The time period between 1150 and 1200 saw many hard fought battles between the Chalukyas and their feudatories who were also at war with each other. By the time of Jagadhekamalla II, the Chalukyas had lost control of Vengi and his successor, Tailapa III, was defeated by the Kakatiya king Prola in 1149. Tailapa III was taken captive and later released bringing down {{the prestige of the}} Western Chalukyas. Seeing decadence and uncertainty <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> Chalukya rule, the Hoysalas and Seunas also encroached upon the empire. Hoysala Narasimha I defeated and killed Tailapa III but was unable to overcome the Kalachuris who were vying for control of the same region. In 1157 the Kalachuris of Kalyanis under Bijjala II captured Kalyani and occupied it for the next twenty years, forcing the Chalukyas to move their capital to Annigeri in the present day Dharwad district.|$|E
25|$|Generally, the {{environment}} of Matsu Islands is still good. The major source of pollution is from family and military households waste. There are however concerns that the continued lack of modern sewage facilities results in household waste <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> groundwater.|$|E
25|$|Lake Nyos is {{thermally}} stratified, with {{layers of}} warm, less dense water near the surface floating on the colder, denser water layers near the lake's bottom. Over long periods, carbon dioxide gas <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> the cold water at the lake's bottom is dissolved in great amounts.|$|E

25|$|Sinkholes are a {{consistent}} issue along highways in East Tennessee. One particularly problematic stretch is {{a section of}} I-40 between miles 365 and 367 in Loudon County, which is underlain by cavernous rock strata. In the 1970s and 1980s, TDOT employed numerous stabilization measures in this area, including backfilling existing sinkholes with limestone, collapsing potential sinkholes, and paving roadside ditches to prevent surface water from <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> the volatile soil.|$|E
25|$|As of 2013, about 400 {{metric tons}} per day of cooling water was being {{pumped into the}} reactors. Another 400 metric tons of {{groundwater}} was <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> the structure. Some 800 metric tons of water per day was removed for treatment, half of which was reused for cooling and half diverted to storage tanks. Ultimately the contaminated water, after treatment to remove radionuclides other than tritium, {{may have to be}} dumped into the Pacific. TEPCO intend to create an underground ice wall to reduce the rate contaminated groundwater reaches the sea.|$|E
25|$|Water {{pollution}} {{has also}} {{been found in the}} Santa Ana River and Cajon wash, and pollutants from the March Air Reserve Base and Stringfellow Acid Pits have contaminated groundwater in parts of Riverside County. In 1997, perchlorate, a chemical used to produce explosives, was discovered to be <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> the groundwater under Rialto in a plume that continues to grow. In 2007, the Rialto City council petitioned the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Superfund status to clean up the origin site. The sites comprising March Air Reserve Base, Norton Air Force Base and the Stringfellow Acid Pits have already been classified as EPA Superfund toxic waste sites.|$|E

25|$|Prior {{to human}} development, Flushing Meadows was {{originally}} a tidal marsh, with Flushing Creek receiving south-flowing waters from the tides of Flushing Bay. Although the lakes were built as freshwater lakes and dammed to mitigate tidal effects, flooding continues {{to effect the}} park. The lakes are also highly eutrophic, due to nutrients such as phosphorus from the former marshland <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> the water, leading {{to the death of}} fish in the lakes. The regular tidal action that would filter the lakes is prevented by the dam. In addition, the lakes are subject to pollution and storm runoff from the nearby highways, via pipes which feed into the lakes.|$|E
25|$|Fresh air {{for both}} the crew and engine was drawn into the tank via an 18m long rubber hose to which a float was {{attached}} to keep one end above the water’s surface. A radio antenna was also attached to the float to provide communication between the tank crew and the transport barge. The tank's engine was converted to be cooled with seawater, and the exhaust pipes were fitted with overpressure valves. Any water <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> the tank's hull could be expelled by an internal bilge pump. Navigation underwater was accomplished using a directional gyrocompass or by following instructions radioed from the transport barge.|$|E
25|$|The corium {{undergoes}} degradation. The Elephant's Foot, {{hard and}} strong shortly after its formation, is now cracked enough that a glue-treated wad easily separated its top 1–2 centimeter layer. The structure's shape itself is changed as the material slides down and settles. The corium temperature is now just slightly different from ambient, {{the material is}} therefore subject to both day-night temperature cycling and weathering by water. The heterogeneous nature of corium and different thermal expansion coefficients of the components causes material deterioration with thermal cycling. Large amounts of residual stresses were introduced during solidification due to the uncontrolled cooling rate. The water, <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> pores and microcracks and freezing there, the same process that creates potholes on roads, accelerates cracking.|$|E

25|$|The INA trials, {{the stories}} of Subhas Chandra Bose ("Netaji"), as well as {{the stories of}} INA's fight during the Siege of Imphal and in Burma were <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> the glaring public-eye at the time. These, {{received}} through the wireless sets and the media, fed discontent and ultimately inspired the sailors to strike. In Karachi, revolt broke out on board the Royal Indian Navy ship, HMIS Hindustan off Manora Island. The ship, as well as shore establishments were taken over by mutineers. Later, it spread to the HMIS Bahadur. A naval central strike committee was formed on 19 February 1946, led by M. S. Khan and Madan Singh. The next day, ratings from Castle and Fort Barracks in Bombay, joined in the revolt when rumours (which were untrue) spread that HMIS Talwars ratings had been fired upon.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{the wreck}} could not {{determine}} whether the escape hatch was workable from the inside. Analysts theorise that the men may have rejected risking the escape hatch {{even if it were}} operable, and would have preferred to wait for a submarine rescue ship to attach itself to the hatch. The sub was relatively close to shore {{and in the middle of}} a large naval exercise. The sailors had every reason to believe that rescue would arrive quickly. Using the escape trunk was risky. The sailors were in a compartment that was initially at surface atmosphere pressure, so they did not risk decompression sickness ('the bends') if they used the rescue hoods to ascend to the surface. But the Arctic water was extremely cold and they could not survive long in the water. Also, water was slowly <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> the ninth compartment, increasing the atmospheric pressure and thus the risk of decompression sickness and death when they ascended to the surface. In addition it was likely that some of the men were seriously injured and escape would have been very difficult for them.|$|E
500|$|Deakins {{cinematography}} was routinely praised, with The Hollywood Reporter {{calling it}} [...] "foreboding" [...] and [...] "well-crafted," [...] and Travers saying [...] "the everyday agonies of prison life are meticulously laid out ... {{you can almost}} feel the frustration and rage <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> {{the skin of the}} inmates". Gleiberman praised the choice of scenery, writing that the [...] "moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality" [...] that makes the film very realistic. The Hollywood Reporter said of Newman's score, [...] "at its best moments, alights with radiant textures and sprightly grace notes, nicely emblematic of the film's central them," [...] and Klady describing it as [...] "the right balance between the somber and the absurd".|$|E

500|$|On December 2, the {{trustees}} authorized subscriptions to be solicited and paid to Waller {{with a goal}} of $20,000. On May 20, 1863, the board met again and learned that $12,800 had been pledged and the board then set up a building committee of Waller, Hines, Moores, E.N. Cook, and Thomas Milton Gatch. It was mainly {{through the efforts of}} the Reverend Waller that the hall was built. Several designs were then considered for the new building, and on February 22, 1864, by a vote of 16 to 1 the board selected the final plan that called for a brick building with a stone foundation. The foundation was to rise to a level [...] above the ground to prevent moisture from the ground <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> the bricks.|$|E
500|$|Following the wall's construction, South Florida {{endured a}} drought {{severe enough to}} cause serious {{wildfires}} in 1939. The influx of humans had a detrimental effect on the plants and animals of the region when melaleuca trees (Melaleuca quinquenervia) were introduced to help with drainage, along with Australian pines brought in by developers as windbreaks. The region's timber was devastated for lumber supplies. [...] Alligators, birds, frogs, and fish were hunted on a large scale. Entire rookeries of wading birds were shot to collect their plumes, which were used in women's hats in the early 20th century. The largest impact people had on the region was the diversion of water away from the Everglades. Canals were deepened and widened, and water levels fell dramatically, causing chaos in food webs. Salt water replaced fresh water in the canals, and by 1997 scientists noticed that salt water was <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> the Biscayne Aquifer, South Florida's water source.|$|E
500|$|The {{effects of}} the Hoover Dike were seen immediately. An {{extended}} drought occurred in the 1930s, and with the wall preventing water leaving Lake Okeechobee and canals and ditches removing other water, the Everglades became parched. Peat turned to dust, and salty ocean water entered Miami's wells. When the city brought in an expert to investigate, he discovered that {{the water in the}} Everglades was the area's groundwater—here, it appeared on the surface. Draining the Everglades removed this groundwater, which was replaced by ocean water <b>seeping</b> <b>into</b> the area's wells. In 1939, [...] of Everglades burned, and the black clouds of peat and sawgrass fires hung over Miami. Underground peat fires burned roots of trees and plants without burning the plants in some places. Scientists who took soil samples before draining had not taken into account that the organic composition of peat and muck in the Everglades was mixed with bacteria that added little to the process of decomposition underwater because they were not mixed with oxygen. As soon as the water was drained and oxygen mixed with the soil, the bacteria began to break down the soil. In some places, homes had to be moved on to stilts and [...] of topsoil was lost.|$|E
50|$|The {{fluorescent}} penetrant {{is applied}} to the surface and allowed time to <b>seep</b> <b>into</b> flaws or defects in the material. The process of waiting for the penetrant to <b>seep</b> <b>into</b> flaws is called Dwell Time. Dwell time varies by material {{and the size of the}} indications that are intended to be identified but is generally less than 30 minutes. It requires much less time to penetrate larger flaws because the penetrant is able to soak in much faster. The opposite is true for smaller flaws/defects.|$|R

Mccall realizes that just as the alien programming <b>seeped</b> <b>into</b> A.S.M.O.D.S., so A.S.M.O.D.S. has <b>seeped</b> <b>into</b> the alien, arming it with a nationalistic impulse to destroy America's enemies.|$|R
