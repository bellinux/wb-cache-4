25|$|For {{the opening}} {{attack of the}} Battle of Amiens on 8 August 1918, 174 Bde was given the initial {{objective}} of capturing Malard Wood. 6th and 7th Londons led the assault, with 8th Bn in support. The attack proceeded well, but all three battalions became mixed up. After reorganiation on the first objective, the four companies of 7th Bn went forward and captured the ravine behind, and supplies were brought up by <b>supply</b> <b>tank</b> and dropped by aircraft. 173 Brigade {{had been unable to}} take their objective of Chipilly Eidge, so they took over the Malard Wood line to launch a second attack. On 9 August the 7th then made a hastily organised attack with tanks and American troops, which successfully cleared Chipilly Ridge and Gressaire Wood. Casualties had been heavy – over two days the 7th lost 300 men – but the results were excellent. After the Battle of Amiens, the battalion was reinforced with men from the Staffords and the Lincolns and began to train intensively for mobile warfare.|$|E

The academy's facilities include classrooms, a [...] water <b>supply</b> <b>tank,</b> a subway tunnel with tracks and two subway cars, a training course for engine drivers, a helicopter pad, a replica ship, and multiple buildings designed {{to simulate the}} different types of building construction encountered within the city limits.|$|E
2500|$|Flight 514 {{was over}} Usinsk, at an {{altitude}} of 10,600 m (FL 348) when the first signs of a problem were noticed at about 06:59 local time (02:59 UTC). Later, a complete loss of electrical systems occurred, which resulted in the loss of navigational systems and the loss of electric fuel pumps, leaving the aircraft with just [...] of usable fuel, enough for just 30 minutes flight. The loss of the electrically driven pumps prevented transfer of fuel from the wing tanks to the engine <b>supply</b> <b>tank</b> in the fuselage. At about 07:47, the emergency authorities at Izhma were informed that the aircraft may be making an emergency landing at the airport there. [...] Izhma Airport is a former airfield that is now used only for helicopters, and the [...] runway is closed and abandoned. The airfield, having closed to fixed-wing aircraft in 2003, was not marked on then-current [...] maps.|$|E

5000|$|As tank {{doctrine}} developed, {{the role}} of tanks started to be defined. Initially based on naval ideas, in late 1916 Captain Giffard Le Quesne Martel (later Major General Sir) proposed a tank army formed of Destroyer tanks, Battle tanks (of Heavy, Medium and Light types), Torpedo tanks (utilising large trench mortars), Engineer <b>tanks,</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>tanks</b> and Ambulance tanks ...|$|R

50|$|In July 1917, two Gun Carrier Companies {{were formed}} of 24 {{vehicles}} each. Probably {{none of them}} ever fired a shot. As breakthroughs never materialized the vehicles were ultimately only used as <b>supply</b> <b>tanks.</b> It was calculated a single tank had the same carrying capacity as 291 human porters. The first Gun Carrier Tanks arrived in France before the Third Battle of Ypres (31 July - 10 November 1917) and were attached to XVIII Corps. The gun carriers were first used at the Battle of Pilckem Ridge (31 July - 2 August 1917) {{and by the end}} of the year 44 were in France. The gun carriers moved 60-pounder guns and several hundred tons of ammunition. The gun carriers were rarely employed as mobile artillery but as <b>supply</b> <b>tanks</b> they had much greater capacity than converted Mk I and Mk IV tanks and were well-suited to the conditions of the Western Front and they would remain in constant use until the end of hostilities.|$|R
50|$|At lakes, fish ponds or gravel pits in the area, water {{take-off}} {{points were}} installed. In particularly endangered areas, special ponds were dug {{in order to}} provide rapid and efficient water collection by fire engines. Where there are no rivers for water collection, old heating oil tanks were used as water <b>supply</b> <b>tanks</b> each with between 20,000 and 100,000 litres of water in the ground.|$|R
50|$|The British <b>supplied</b> <b>tanks</b> to the USSR in {{the form}} of the Matilda, Valentine and Churchill {{infantry}} tanks. Soviet tank soldiers liked the Valentine for its reliability, cross country performance and low silhouette. The Soviet's opinion of the Matilda and Churchill was less favourable as a result of their weak 40-mm guns (without HE shells) and inability to operate in harsh rasputitsa, winter and offroad conditions.|$|R
50|$|Cleaning is {{accomplished}} by inserting a choke plug {{into one of the}} lines leading to the transfer pump, and sucking large volumes of water from a wash-water <b>supply</b> <b>tank</b> into the choked line. This choke plug is mounted on a rod, and is inserted into the line before cleaning, and pulled out for regular milking. Due to the choke, the water, which is sufficient to completely fill the pipe, is sucked up one side of the pipeline, over the high point joining the two pipeline sections, and then flows back to the receiver bowl and transfer pump through the unchoked line. The transfer pump is then used to move the cleaning solution from the receiver bowl back to the wash-water <b>supply</b> <b>tank</b> to restart the process.|$|E
5000|$|Under {{this system}} a {{water-tight}} growing bed, containing either clean gravel or coarse sand as the rooting medium, is periodically flooded {{for a short}} period (5 to 10 minutes) with a nutrient solution pumped from a <b>supply</b> <b>tank.</b> By placing the nutrient solution <b>supply</b> <b>tank</b> below the growing bed, the nutrient solution can drain back by gravity. This hydroponic growing system is little used today other than for hobby-type systems. The method is inefficient in its use of water and plant nutrient reagents. Root disease occurrence and nutrient element insufficiencies can occur with repeated use of the nutrient solution. Because it is a [...] "closed” system, the re-circulated nutrient solution will require reconstitution, filtering, and sterilization. Within the growing period, the nutrient solution may require replacement. The rooting medium will require washing to remove root debris and accumulated precipitates as well as sterilization before reuse.|$|E
50|$|For the small-farm pipeline, {{portable}} milkers are {{inserted into}} this cleaning loop usually by sucking the cleaning solution {{out of the}} wash <b>supply</b> <b>tank</b> through the milker claw and outputting from the milker hoses into the choked end of the line. When the water returns to the receiver bowl, the transfer pump returns the water back to the milker's water pickup tank.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of cryogenic fluid cooling {{in the environmental}} control system {{of the space shuttle}} was conducted. The technique for treating the cryogenic fluid storage and <b>supply</b> <b>tanks</b> and subsystems as integrated systems was developed. It was concluded that a basic incompatibility exists between the heat generated and the cryogen usage rate and cryogens cannot be used to absorb the generated heat. The use of radiators and accumulators to provide additional cooling capability is recommended...|$|R

In the event of an emergency, the air stair can be jettisoned. The aft lower lobe contains the maintenance console and mission specific equipment.|$|R
50|$|The 2007 John F.

50|$|The {{two-stroke}} Sonett II transmissions had a freewheel {{that could}} be engaged and disengaged while in motion via a pull handle down near the throttle pedal. The freewheel was required in the normal (non oil pump engines) SAAB two stroke engines {{but not in the}} Sonett since it had an automatic oiling system fed from a <b>supply</b> <b>tank</b> that obviated the need to add oil to the fuel.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} be better {{equipped}} for future forest fires, metalled tracks were built exclusively for fire engines. At lakes, fish ponds or gravel pits in the area, water take-off points were installed. In addition new water storage ponds for firefighting {{were built in the}} Südheide. Where there are no rivers for water collection, old heating oil tanks were used as water <b>supply</b> <b>tanks,</b> each with between 20,000 and 100,000 litres of water in the ground.|$|R
50|$|The {{former railway}} water supply pumping station {{was built in}} 1913 on a waterhole on Lagoon Creek at Caboolture. It was the third pump site drawing water from this source to <b>supply</b> <b>tanks</b> at the Caboolture railway station {{replenishing}} the stock of steam locomotives. The facility was developed in stages from {{the opening of the}} North Coast railway line until 1947 and its use was discontinued in 1968 when the use of steam locomotives on the line ceased.|$|R
5000|$|Pashan hill is {{the spur}} of Baner Hill, with an {{elevation}} of 660 m. The plantation drive also takes place here. It is a great spot of birdwatchers and for picnics.

50|$|A relief or {{safety valve}} on the {{discharge}} {{side of the}} positive displacement pump is therefore necessary. The relief valve can be internal or external. The pump manufacturer normally has the option to supply internal relief or safety valves. The internal valve is usually only used as a safety precaution. An external relief valve in the discharge line, with a return line back to the suction line or <b>supply</b> <b>tank</b> provides increased safety.|$|E
50|$|In {{this type}} of clock, water is run into a {{stationary}} vessel from a tank which is kept meniscus-full meaning that water rises over {{the top edge of}} the tank forming a convex meniscus and excess water is drained away. Since the depth of the water in the <b>supply</b> <b>tank</b> is constant, water is released at a constant rate; the depth of water in the receiving vessel is a measure of time.|$|E
5000|$|In 1982 International Military Services (IMS), {{a company}} wholly {{owned by the}} Ministry of Defence (MoD), was given {{permission}} to repair British-made Chieftain tanks captured by Iraq from Iran.
