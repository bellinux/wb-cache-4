40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} new {{extension}} of splicing systems, called multiple splicing systems, {{based on a}} kind of logic grammars. First, we introduce a class of Elementary formal systems, called simple H-form EFS, and show that its generative power is equivalent to the class of basic splicing systems (the original <b>Head's</b> <b>splicing</b> system) and is more adequate as a representation device for formal languages. Next, we gradually extend the simple class of EFSs and get a very natural extension of splicing systems, multiple splicing systems. We show that multiple splicing systems have universal computability...|$|R
40|$|KIF 3 A/B, a kinesin {{involved}} in intraflagellar transport and Golgi trafficking, is distinctive {{because it contains}} two nonidentical motor domains. Our hypothesis {{is that the two}} heads have distinct functional properties, which are tuned to maximize the performance of the wild-type heterodimer. To test this, we investigated the motility of wild-type KIF 3 A/B heterodimer and chimaeric KIF 3 A/A and KIF 3 B/B homodimers made by <b>splicing</b> the <b>head</b> of one subunit to the rod and tail of the other. The first result is that KIF 3 A/B is processive, consistent with its transport function in cells. Secondly, the KIF 3 B/B homodimer moves at twice the speed of the wild-type motor but has reduced processivity, suggesting a trade-off between speed and processivity. Third, the KIF 3 A/A homodimer moves fivefold slower than wild-type, demonstrating distinct functional differences between the two heads. The heterodimer speed cannot be accounted for by a sequential head model in which the two heads alternate along the microtubule with identical speeds as in the homodimers. Instead, the data are consistent with a coordinated head model in which detachment of the slow KIF 3 A head from the microtubule is accelerated roughly threefold by the KIF 3 B head...|$|R
40|$|A <b>Head</b> <b>splicing</b> system (H-system) {{consists}} of a finite set of strings (words) written over a finite alphabet, along with a finite set of rules that acts on the strings by iterated cutting and pasting to create a splicing language. Any interpretation that is aligned with Tom Head’s original idea {{is one in which}} the strings represent double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) and the rules represent the cutting and pasting action of restriction enzymes and ligase, respectively. A new way of writing the rule sets is adopted so as to make the biological interpretation transparent. This approach is used in a formal language- theoretic analysis of the hierarchy of certain classes of splicing systems, namely simple, semi-simple and semi-null splicing systems. The relations between such systems and their associated languages are given as theorems, corollaries and counter examples. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{splicing}} {{operation was}} introduced in 1987 by Head as a mathematical model of the recombination of DNA molecules {{under the influence of}} restriction and ligases enzymes. This operation allows us to define a computing (language generating) device, called a splicing system. Other variants of this original definition were also proposed by Paun and Pixton respectively. The computational power of splicing systems has been thoroughly investigated. Nevertheless, an interesting problem is still open, namely the characterization of the class of regular languages generated by finite splicing systems. In this paper, we will solve the problem for a special class of finite splicing systems, termed reflexive splicing systems, according to each of the definitions of splicing given by Paun and Pixton. This special class of systems contains, in perticular, finite <b>Head</b> <b>splicing</b> systems. The notion of a constant, given by Schützenberger, once again intervenes...|$|R

40|$|In {{search for}} a {{universal}} splicing system, {{in this paper we}} present a Post system universal for the class of Post systems, and we discuss its translation into an extended splicing system with multiplicity. We also discuss the complexity of the resulting universal splicing system, comparing our result with recent known results about the translation of universal Turing machines into splicing systems. 1 Introduction Since the possibility of molecular computing was shown by Adleman's pioneering work ([1]) which, in a test tube, experimentally solves a small instance of an NPcomplete problem, the theoretical formalization of such a new computing technology has been attracting much attention in computer science ([3][5][6][12][17]).

40|$|In this report, we {{document}} {{an unusual}} mode of tissue-enriched gene expression that is primarily mediated by alternative and inefficient splicing. We have analyzed posttranscriptional {{regulation of the}} Drosophila erect wing gene, which provides a vital neuronal function and {{is essential for the}} formation of certain muscles. Its predominant protein product, the 116 -kDa EWG protein, a putative transcriptional regulator, can provide all known erect wing-associated functions. Moreover, consistent with its function, the 116 -kDa protein is highly enriched in neurons and is also observed transiently in migrating myoblasts. In contrast to the protein distribution, we observed that erect wing transcripts are present in comparable levels in neuron-enriched heads and neuron-poor bodies of adult Drosophila. Our analyses shows that erect wing transcript consists of 10 exons and is alternatively spliced and that a subset of introns are inefficiently spliced. We also show that the 116 -kDa EWG protein-encoding <b>splice</b> isoform is <b>head</b> enriched. In contrast, bodies have lower levels of transcripts that can encode the 116 -kDa protein and greater amounts of unprocessed erect wing RNA. Thus, the enrichment of the 116 -kDa protein in heads is ensured by tissue-specific alternative and inefficient splicing and not by transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, this regulation is biologically important, as an increased level of the 116 -kDa protein outside the nervous system is lethal...|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} only three parts of a hockey stick ever named in the rules: the head, the handle, and the splice. Originally (until 2004) the handle was the part above the bottom end of the <b>splice</b> and the <b>head</b> was the part below the bottom end of the splice. Other terms in common use are [...] "grip", which refers to {{the part of the}} stick held, {{particularly}} that area held with two hands when hitting the ball. Most sticks have a round grip which is covered in a non-slip, sweat absorbent, fabric tape. The handle remains rounded on the reverse, back or right hand-side but becomes gradually flat on the [...] "face" [...] side and also becomes wider, changing from a diameter of approximately 30 mm to a flat width of approximately 46 mm (the permitted maximum was 2 in—now 51 mm). This flat area above the curve of the head is generally referred to as the [...] "shaft". The head of the stick is generally thought of as the curved part. The right side is called the face, the upturn the [...] "toe" [...] and the bend of the head where it joins the shaft the [...] "heel". In recent times using the edges of the stick (as well as the face side) to strike at the ball has been permitted and thus [...] "forehand edge stroke" [...] and [...] "reverse edge stroke" [...] will be found in rule terminology. Forehand and reverse stroke refers to the taking of these strokes, from the right or left hand side of the body respectively, as the stick may be used [...] "face up" [...] or [...] "face down" [...] to make an edge stroke, the two edges of the stick are not separately named but simply referred to as edges. Initially there were six rule requirements applying to the hockey stick: ...|$|R
40|$|How to {{tell the}} real from the fake We {{are living in a}} world where seeing is no longer believing – the {{technology}} that allows for digital media to be manipulated and distorted is developing at break-neck speeds. And at the same time our understanding of the technological, ethical, and legal implications is lagging behind. How is this technology affecting our society and how do we contend with the implications? Hany Farid describes the impact of digital tampering and the development of mathematical and computational algorithms to expose digital fakes. Wars have produced some of the most memorable and powerful photographs. From a mere snapshot in space and time, these photographs seem to capture the very essence of the suffering of thousands, Figure 1. For this reason, these images hold a unique place in documenting our collective history. For the past decade, Adnan Hajj, a renowned photographer, has produced striking war photographs from the on-going struggle in the Middle East. On August 7 th of this year, the Reuters news agency published one of Hajj’s photographs showing the remnants of an Israeli bombing of a Lebanese town, Figure 2. In the week that followed, hundreds of bloggers and nearly every major news organization reported that the photograph had been doctored with the addition of more smoke. The general consensus was one of outrage and anger – Hajj was accused of doctoring the image to exaggerate the impact of the Israeli shelling. The feeling was, given the sanctity of war photographs, that this manipulation was simply inexcusable. An embarrassed Reuters quickly retracted the photograph and removed from its archives nearly 1, 000 photographs contributed by Hajj. A period of soul searching followed. Photography lost its innocence many years ago. The nearly iconic portrait of the U. S. President Abraham Lincoln (circa 1860) was a fake, having been created by <b>splicing</b> together the <b>head</b> of Lincoln with the body of Southern politician John Calhoun, Figure 3. This fake was only the beginning of a long history of photographic trickery. In {{the early part of the}} 1900 s Stalin famously had his enemies air-brushed out of photographs...|$|R
40|$|Sexually {{reproducing}} organisms produce {{two very}} different phenotypes (males and females), by differential deployment of essentially the same gene content. This dimorphism provides an excellent model to study how transcriptomes are differentially regulated, {{which is one of}} the central problems of biology. The core sex determination pathway of Drosophila is a well described cascade of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, but knowledge of the downstream components is largely incomplete. High throughput technologies have provided great advances in understanding transcriptome regulation, but limits of the technology have lead to a focus on whole gene expression measurements, rather than post-transcriptional regulation. RNA-Seq experiments, in which transcripts are converted to cDNA and sequenced, allow the resolution and quantification of alternative transcript isoforms, potentially elucidating the post-transcriptional network. However, methods to analyze splicing are underdeveloped, and challenges in transcript assembly and quantification remain unresolved. This work describes the development of the Splicing Analysis Kit (Spanki) as a fast, open source, suite of tools that uses simulations based on real RNA-Seq data to characterize errors in a given dataset, and user tunable filters that minimize those errors. Spanki quantifies splicing differences in transcripts from the same loci within a sample, as well as between samples by using only those reads that directly assay splicing events (junction spanning reads). Despite the reliance on a fraction of the total data, sequencing depth typically generated in an RNA-Seq experiment is sufficient to identify differentially regulated splicing, and error profiles are superior. I demonstrate that this computational approach outperforms several commonly used approaches in an analysis of sex-differential <b>splicing</b> in Drosophila <b>heads.</b> Next I examine the effects of disrupting post-transcriptional regulation in Drosophila heads. I apply the Spanki software to analyze RNA-Seq data for mutant lines of two post-transcriptional regulators: Darkener of apricot (Doa) and found in neurons (fne). Doa, a serine-threonine kinase, regulates splicing by phosphorylating SR proteins, vital components of the splicing machinery. Found in neurons (fne) binds to transcripts and is involved in RNA metabolism. I demonstrate sex-differences in response to disruption of post-transcriptional regulation, and hypothesize that they are informative of sex-differentiation pathways. Finally, I examine the conservation of splicing regulation within the Drosophila lineage. I show that junction based splicing analysis is effective in making interspecific comparisons without the need for complete transcript models. I use these results to demonstrate the conservation of sex-differential splicing across 40 million years of evolution in 15 species in the Drosophila genus...|$|R
