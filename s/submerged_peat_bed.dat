40|$|The {{potential}} {{use of a}} <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> {{to treat}} the H- 12 Outfall discharge {{to bring it to}} new compliance limits was previously investigated and reported utilizing a 7 hour retention time. The influence of retention time (contact time) of water with peat moss on the removal of copper from the water was investigated under laboratory conditions using vertical flow peat moss columns. Reduction of the necessary retention time has a large influence on the design sizing of any <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> that would be constructed to treat the H- 12 discharge on a full scale basis. Retention times of 5 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour were tested to determine the copper removal by the peat columns using vertical flow. Water samples were collected after 4, 8, 12, and 16 water volumes had passed through the columns and analyzed for a suite of metals, with quantitative emphasis on copper. Laboratory results indicated that copper removal was very high at each of the 3 retention times tested, ranging from 99. 6 % removal at 5 and 3 hours to 98. 8 % removal at 1 hour. All these values are much lower that the new compliance limit for the outfall. The results also indicated that most divalent metals were removed to their normal reporting detection limit for the analytical methods used, including zinc. Lead levels in the H- 12 discharge used in this study were below PQL in all samples analyzed. While each of the retention times studied removed copper very well, there were indications that 1 hour is probably too short for an operational, long-term facility. At that retention time, there was about 6 % compaction of the peat in the column due to the water velocity, and this may affect long term hydraulic conductivity of the <b>peat</b> <b>bed.</b> At that retention time, copper concentration in the effluent was higher than the other times tested, although still very low. Because of the potential compacting and somewhat reduced removal efficiency at a 1 hour retention time, it would be prudent to design to at least a 3 hour retention time for water in any <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> system that is proposed for the H- 12 Outfall. A scope to design and install a pilot level study at H- 12 is currently under development. This study will be designed to examine some of the engineering issues that are of concern regarding the scaling of an actual <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> to treat the volumes of water that are typically discharged through the H- 12 Outfall.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation of late Holocene deposits on the Belgian coastal plain. The upper clastic deposits overlying the uppermost intercalated <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> were studied on the basis of lithology, radiocarbon dates and foraminiferal assemblages to determine why silting-up phases or <b>peat</b> <b>beds</b> are lacking, and to establish the evolution of the sedimentary environments as well as the age of the deposits. Two contrasting sites, in quite different locations and showing a different stratigraphy, were studied. It appears that the coastal evolution was not gradual and continuous, but characterised by short periods with high-energy conditions alternating with long periods where low-energy conditions and little sedimentation prevailed. The evolution is determined mainly by tidal channel activity. At about 3400 cal. yr BP, the peat was eroded in narrow zones by the main tidal channels and this until the landward limit of the plain. The peat was only partly flooded and mudflats fringed the channels. With time, new tributaries formed and the channel network progressively enlarged. The channels were rapidly filled, followed by a period of little sedimentation, which lasted at least until 1400 - 1200 cal. yr BP. The following channel activity is characterised by lateral sedimentation, rather than vertical erosion, together with increased sediment reworking. The mechanisms of coastal change in the late Holocene might be similar over the entire plain, but the timing of the changes is certainly not...|$|R

Because of the many controversies relating to these topics, the Belgian litera­ture has been reviewed. An initial rapid sea-level rise prior to ca. 7800 cal BP resulted in a rapid shift of the facies belts across the palaeovalley and was associated with rapid filling with no formation of intercalated <b>peat</b> <b>beds.</b> A deceleration in the rate of the sea-level rise with sufficient sediment supply produced rapid facies changes registered as frequent alternations of mud, peat and gyttja in the sedimentary sequence deposited between ca. 7800 and 6000 cal BP. The facies changes are determined by a sedimentological control related to the tidal channel and creek network, and not by sea-level fluctuations. Periods of peat growth lasted longer and the lateral extension became more wide­spread as deceleration of the sea-level rise and filling of the plain continued. This was associated with progradation of the shoreface from ca. 6000 cal BP onwards. Tidal conditions returned to the area from ca. 4000 cal BP onwards. This return was accompanied by erosion and landward migration of the shoreface and channel network.

Ammonia and dust levels were also measured to assess conditions in the stable. Ammonia was not detected or was at very low levels (< 0. 25 ppm) in the boxes in which peat was used as bedding; but its concentration was clearly higher (1. 5 – 7. 0 ppm) in stalls with wood shavings as bedding.

40|$|When {{chrysanthemum}} growers change {{soil for}} a soilless growing system they aim for labour cost reduction, quality and yield improvement and reduced emissions of nutrients. Because many attempts {{to come up}} with a viable soilless system failed, improvements and systemizations of the design process were examined. The design methodology chosen uses goal setting based on stakeholder engagement, systemised quantification of a set of conditions for the final system, and a systemised choice of competing systems and quantification of the properties of the competing systems. The set of conditions is assembled upon consultation of a wide variety of growers and experts in fields of plant protection, plant physiology, water management, substrate characteristics, economics and nutrition. The conditions and properties correspond to each other to the extent that both are based on the same measuring methods and expressed in the same units. Thus matches between conditions and properties can be scored. After the complete set of conditions and matching properties is scored, the average of the scores is taken as a measure for the suitability of the whole system. Because properties are quantified, the process is based on knowledge, and gaps in knowledge are identified. Favourable combinations of properties may be applied to systems lacking these properties in order to improve them. This design methodology was used to select and improve a set of 11 competing systems. The resulting 4 improved systems were built and used for growing in experiments. Systems included a soil bed, a sand <b>bed,</b> a <b>peat</b> <b>bed</b> and a cassette bed. The soil bed was a 70 cm deep bed of the original soil on a water impermeable foil with a drainage system.

50|$|In geology, a key bed (syn marker bed) is a {{relatively}} thin layer of sedimentary rock that is readily recognized {{on the basis of}} either its distinct physical characteristics or fossil content and can be mapped over a very large geographic area. As a result, a key bed is useful for correlating sequences of sedimentary rocks over a large area. Typically, key beds were created as the result of either instantaneous events or (geologically speaking) very short episodes of the widespread deposition of a specific types of sediment. As the result, key beds often can be used for both mapping and correlating sedimentary rocks and dating them. Volcanic ash beds (tonsteins and bentonite beds) and impact spherule beds, and specific megaturbidites are types of key beds created by instantaneous events.
