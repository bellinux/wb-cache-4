60|$|There {{lived in}} those days, round the corner--in Bishopsgate Street Without--one Brogley, <b>sworn</b> <b>broker</b> and appraiser, who kept a shop where every {{description}} of second-hand furniture was {{exhibited in the}} most uncomfortable aspect, and under circumstances and in combinations the most completely foreign to its purpose. Dozens of chairs hooked on to washing-stands, which with difficulty poised themselves {{on the shoulders of}} sideboards, which in their turn stood upon the wrong side of dining-tables, gymnastic with their legs upward on the tops of other dining-tables, were among its most reasonable arrangements. A banquet array of dish-covers, wine-glasses, and decanters was generally to be seen, spread forth upon the bosom of a four-post bedstead, for the entertainment of such genial company as half-a-dozen pokers, and a hall lamp. A set of window curtains with no windows belonging to them, would be seen gracefully draping a barricade of chests of drawers, loaded with little jars from chemists' shops; while a homeless hearthrug severed from its natural companion the fireside, braved the shrewd east wind in its adversity, and trembled in melancholy accord with the shrill complainings of a cabinet piano, wasting away, a string a day, and faintly resounding to the noises of the street in its jangling and distracted brain. Of motionless clocks that never stirred a finger, and seemed as incapable of being successfully wound up, as the pecuniary affairs of their former owners, there was always great choice in Mr Brogley's shop; and various looking-glasses, accidentally placed at compound interest of reflection and refraction, presented to the eye an eternal perspective of bankruptcy and ruin.|$|E
50|$|From 1995-2003 he was {{member of}} the Provincial Government of Friesland and {{delegate}} for economic affairs, tourism and agriculture. In that capacity, he initiated in 1999 The Frisian Lakes Project, an investment of 330 million euro’s in order to upgrade {{the quality of the}} Frisian Lakes and surrounding area. Previously from 1982-1989 he was chairman of the Liberal Group in the municipality Council of Opsterland and from 1988 -1995 chairman of the Liberal Group in the Provincial Government of Friesland.

50|$|After James Sharp's {{death in}} 1839, Granville Sharp led the firm, {{making it a}} new partnership, J. G. & G. A. Sharp, in 1842. They benefited from the Bank of England having finally opened its doors in 1840 to 'any <b>sworn</b> <b>broker</b> in the {{purchase}} and sale of gold bars'. A major change came in 1847, when Frederick Charles Wilkins joined the partnership, now Sharps & Wilkins. However, both Sharps died shortly afterwards (perhaps the reason for Wilkins joining {{if they were in}} poor health). The Sharps name, known in the City for over 60 years, was retained, although there has now been no family connection for over 150 years. The business was run by Frederick Wilkins, then his son and grandson, for the next 90 years. His immediate challenge was the gold rushes in California in 1849 and Australia in 1851.|$|E
5000|$|By its [...] "Kaufmannshantierung" [...] (merchant regulation) {{the senate}} granted all foreign merchants, {{including}} the Portuguese equal rights as to export, import and wholesale trade in 1612, while all crafts, {{dominated by the}} gilds, remained closed for foreigners. According to a [...] "rolla" [...] or list of that time, they numbered 125 adults, besides servants and children. From 1611 they possessed a cemetery in the neighbouring Holstein-Pinneberg city of Altona, which was used until 1871. In 1617 they obtained {{the right to choose}} four <b>sworn</b> <b>brokers</b> from among their own people as members of Bourse of Hamburg (Germany's first stock exchange); and later on this number was increased to fifteen. In the wake of the establishment of the Sephardic community also Ashkenazi Jews gained - since 1610 - for the first time access to the city, however, at first only as employees in Sephardic households or companies.|$|R
5000|$|A close {{equivalent}} to limited liability partnerships under Polish {{law is the}} spółka partnerska, where all partners are jointly and severely liable for partnership's debts apart from those arising from another partner's misconduct or negligence. This partnership type is only addressed to representatives of some [...] "high risk" [...] occupations, such as lawyers, medicine doctors, tax advisers, accountants, <b>brokers,</b> <b>sworn</b> translators etc.|$|R
40|$|National audienceHeir {{to a long}} {{tradition}} of interventionism applied by public authorities on the regulation of cattle supply markets in Paris, the Caisse de Poissy knew many ups and downs from the creation of the first <b>sworn</b> (or licensed) <b>brokers</b> in the sixteenth-century to the final suppression of the system by napoleon III in 1858. The authorities waver and dither over the opportuneness of upholding the system or not, depending on the priorities of the monarchical power and the pressures exerted by either the butchers or the cattle feeders. Created first and foremost to guarantee the settlement of accounts between butchers and cattle dealers, the fund is also a significant source of revenue for the City of Paris, which explains why the decisions made by the central authorities are not always in keeping with the municipality's interests. From start to finish, the fund is at the centre of a lively debate between free trade supporters and supporters of a system designed to guarantee the regular food supply of the capital. The interest of the debate lies in the evolution of its terms from the Old Regime to the Second Empire, particularly at times when the system was temporarily questioned or even suspended, notably under Turgot in 1825, during the 1791 Revolution, and under the Villèle Ministry in 1825. The arguments put forward by the butchers'unions in the eighteen- and nineteenth-centuries are evidence of the manipulative way this trade tackled the issue to justify the preservation of a corporatist privilege under the pretence of defending the public good. Héritière d'une longue tradition d'intervention des autorités publiques pour la régulation des marchés d'approvisionnement en bestiaux de Paris, la Caisse de Poissy connaît de nombreuses vicissitudes sous l'Ancien Régime, au gré des priorités du pouvoir monarchique et/ou municipal, et des pressions exercées tantôt par les bouchers tantôt par les herbagers. Créée avant tout pour garantir le paiement entre les bouchers et les marchands de bestiaux, la caisse est aussi une source de revenus non négligeable pour la Ville de Paris. Pendant toute son existence, la caisse est l'objet d'un vif débat entre les partisans de la liberté des échanges et ceux qui réclament le maintien d'un système qui est sensé garantir un approvisionnement régulier de la capitale. C'est l'évolution des termes de ce débat sur le long terme, depuis l'Ancien Régime jusqu'au Second Empire, qui est intéressante à suivre, notamment aux périodes où le système est provisoirement suspendu (1776, 1791, 1825) ...|$|R
