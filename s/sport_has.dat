5|$|<b>Sport</b> <b>has</b> {{been both}} {{one of the}} most unifying {{cultural}} forces in Northern England and, thanks to local rivalries such as the Lancashire–Yorkshire Roses rivalry, {{one of the most}} divisive. As huge numbers of people moved into recently-built cities with little cultural heritage, local sports teams offered the population a sense of place and identity that was otherwise absent.|$|E

5|$|Although {{not part}} of the {{official}} programme, curling was contested as a demonstration sport in 1932, 1988 and 1992. Curling was re-added as a demonstration event in 1988 because the Olympics were being held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where the <b>sport</b> <b>has</b> a strong following. In November 1992, the Nagano Winter Olympic Organizing Committee and IOC Coordination Committee reached an agreement to include curling in the official programme of the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. Both the men's and women's tournaments have been held at every Winter Olympics since.|$|E

5|$|Sporting {{competitions}} {{have always}} provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the {{players from the}} audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in stadium and auditorium design, {{as well as in}} recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and spectator <b>sport</b> <b>has</b> become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket. Their ultimate international competitions, the World Cup and test cricket, are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide. A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the Tour de France, unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.|$|E

5|$|Two {{forms of}} juldarigi, from Gijisi (Dangjin) and Yeongsang, are {{recognised}} as Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea. The Yeongsan ceremony is held {{later in the}} year than elsewhere, having been moved from the lunar festival to March 1 in the mid-twentieth century (to commemorate the March 1st Movement). In 2009, a special ₩20000 coin was minted in South Korea commemorating the Yeongsan juldarigi. In Gijisi, where the <b>sport</b> <b>has</b> been practiced for at least 500 years, the traditional East/West divide is replaced with a division of teams into upriver and downriver. The centipede-like shape of the rope is said to resemble {{the way in which the}} villages of the region are arranged. Gijisi is also home to a museum devoted to the practice of juldarigi.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no Olympic competition, there are the World Gliding Championships. The first event {{was held at the}} Samedan in 1948. Since World War II it has been held every two years. There are now six classes open to both sexes, plus three classes for women and two junior classes. The latest {{worldwide}} statistics for 2011 indicate that Germany, the sport's birthplace, is still a center of the gliding world: it accounted for 27percent of the world's glider pilots, and the three major glider manufacturers are still based there. However the meteorological conditions that allow soaring are common and the <b>sport</b> <b>has</b> been taken up in many countries. At the last count there were over 111,000 active civilian glider pilots and 32,920 gliders, plus an unknown number of military cadets and aircraft. Clubs actively seek new members by giving trial flights, which are also a useful source of revenue for them.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, the Government of the Cook Islands {{identified}} {{the lack of}} funding for sport facilities as a key reason why the nation has not succeeded at international competitions. It believed that investing in sporting infrastructure would enable the nation to be more globally competitive. Netball was not recognised as an Olympic sport until 1995. While official recognition as an Olympic sport {{did not mean that}} it was played at the Olympics, it did mean that the national association and the Cook Islands government could then access Olympic funding to help cover costs for facilities, travel, coaching, umpire training and other grass roots development efforts. The Cook Islands Netball Association is the governing body for the sport in the Cook Islands, and historically, the <b>sport</b> <b>has</b> been administered by women. Most netball courts are owned by the local village or club. With the exception of National Auditorium, all courts are outside. In 1990, the Cook Islands Netball Association had 15 clubs affiliated with it, all based in the southern islands group, including Ngatangia/Matavera, Avatiu/Nikao, Arorangi, Titikaveka, Takuvaine, Tupapa, Outer Islands.|$|E
