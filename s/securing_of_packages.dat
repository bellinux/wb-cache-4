40|$|Package {{managers}} are a privileged, centralized mechanism for software update and {{are essential to}} the security of modern computers. This work studies the security <b>of</b> ten popular <b>package</b> managers. These package managers use different mechanisms to provide security including signatures embedded in the package, signatures on metadata detached from the packages, or a signature on the root metadata (a file that contains the <b>secure</b> hashes <b>of</b> the <b>package</b> metadata). The security models used by these package {{managers are}} compared and contrasted. The threat model used to evaluate security in this paper is an attacker that controls a mirror (a copy of the main repository’s contents for a distribution). We demonstrate that it is trivial for an attacker to control an official mirror for a popula...|$|R
40|$|Data {{analyses}} in {{the life}} sciences are moving from tools run on a personal computer to services run on large computing platforms. This creates a need to package tools and dependencies for easy installation, configuration and deployment on distributed platforms. In addition, for secure execution {{there is a need}} for process isolation on a shared platform. Existing virtual machine and container technologies are often more complex than traditional Unix utilities, like chroot, and often require root privileges in order to set up or use. This is especially challenging on HPC systems where users typically do not have root access. We therefore present nsroot, a lightweight Linux namespaces based process isolation tool. It allows restricting the runtime environment of data analysis tools that may not have been designed with security as a top priority, in order to reduce the risk and consequences of security breaches, without requiring any special privileges. The codebase of nsroot is small, and it provides a command line interface similar to chroot. It can be used on all Linux kernels that implement user namespaces. In addition, we propose combining nsroot with the AppImage format for <b>secure</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>packaged</b> applications. nsroot is open sourced and available at: [URL]...|$|R

The VCPD Riot Squad is {{no match for the}} ECM's munitions, prompting Rage and Smarty to help the disadvantaged riot squad. Once Rage and Smarty spot Brand in the building, a chase ensues, but after Rage and Smarty endure the interference as they make {{their way out of the}} building, Gale interrupts them once again. Rage and Smarty survive Gale and pursue the bank robbers, ultimately being pushed towards the subway where Brand is hiding. The ultimate battle between the Virtua Cops and Brand ensues. Throughout the bank campaign, Janet receives disturbing information that the reason for the ECM's bank robbery was to retrieve a <b>secured</b> <b>package</b> <b>of</b> dinosaur genes.|$|R
