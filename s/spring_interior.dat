25|$|Suspension on the 1965 models was redesigned. Replacing {{the former}} leaf-spring rear {{suspension}} {{was a new}} three-link system, with coil <b>springs.</b> <b>Interiors</b> featured a new instrument panel and two-way key system were introduced. The introduction of two keys was for valet parking, in that the rounded head key would only open the trunk or locked glove compartment, while the squared head key would unlock the doors and the ignition.|$|R

50|$|The 135 m2 stage, with {{optional}} 51 m2 extension {{is designed}} to accommodate up to 45-65 musicians, making it well suited to chamber music and other small ensemble music. To eliminate noise from the nearby Southbank Boulevard cars and trams, it is surrounded by 250mm of concrete, mounted on 38 steel <b>springs.</b> The <b>interior</b> is lined with Hoop Pine plywood and {{is designed to}} give ideal bass response for cello and low brass.|$|R
60|$|The Prince {{rose from}} the table, and {{pressing}} {{with his right hand}} on part of the wall, the door of a small closet <b>sprung</b> open; the <b>interior</b> was lined with crimson velvet. He took out of it a cushion of the same regal material, on which reposed, in solitary magnificence, a golden coronet of antique workmanship.|$|R
50|$|The {{design is}} simple and {{impressive}} in scale: 134 ft in length with aisles both to the nave and chancel, a southwest porch and a baptistery under the northwest tower. Southowram stone with Meanwood dressings {{was used for the}} exterior, Harehills stone for the interior. The column supports for the nave arcades are of Park <b>Spring</b> stone. The <b>interior</b> walls are of ashlar stonework.|$|R
25|$|However, the House's {{original}} use {{was short}} – {{no more than}} seven years – before the English Civil War began in 1642 and swept away the court culture from which it <b>sprang.</b> Of its <b>interiors,</b> three ceilings and some wall decorations survive in part, but no interior remains in its original state. This process began as early as 1662, when masons removed a niche and term figures and a chimneypiece.|$|R
50|$|During the Mohave War, Camp Colorado, later renamed Fort Mohave was {{established}} {{on the east}} bank of the Colorado at the crossing and a ferry operated there thereafter, serving traffic on the Mojave Road, the government supply route from Los Angeles that terminated at Fort Mohave.

In 1928, the brand name Artifort is introduced, which combines Art and Comfort. Artifort’s breakthrough came in the 1930s when the company started to use Epeda <b>interior</b> <b>springing.</b> The springing is woven from one single steel wire which increases comfort, is more sustainable and saves production time.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} variants; those built to Diagram 126 for the Midland, Scottish, and Eastern / North Eastern regions had six seats per {{compartment}} in 2nd class, with fold-up arm-rests which folded into the seat-back, while those built to Diagram 128 for the Southern and Western regions, with their heavy commuter loadings into London, had eight seats in each 2nd class compartment, and no arm-rests. 2nd class seating {{was of the}} <b>interior</b> <b>sprung</b> bench type.|$|R
50|$|Its name {{originated}} from {{the existence of}} an abundance of <b>springs</b> in its <b>interior,</b> many of which became known since 1838. At that time, the famed Terceirense historian Francisco Ferreira Drummond was local representative in Vila de São Sebastião, and he investigated the stories about the Furna do Cabrito and Furna d'Água in order to provide fresh potable water to the region. At that time, it was decided that Furna do Cabrito would be a source of water, but not the Furna d'Água, since {{it would be difficult to}} capture the waters of this spring.|$|R

Seating was of the <b>interior</b> <b>sprung</b> bench type. Over time, some SKs and BSKs were re-allocated from other regions to the Western, who tended to try to stitch the arm-rests in the up position.|$|R
60|$|Early {{the next}} morning (for he was early awake after an uncomfortable night upon the floor) he saw cause to adopt a {{different}} explanation. The blinds rose, one after another, {{by means of a}} <b>spring</b> in the <b>interior,</b> and disclosed steel shutters such as we see on the front of shops; these in their turn were rolled up by a similar contrivance; and for the space of about an hour the chambers were left open to the morning air. At the end of that time Mr. Vandeleur, with his own hand, once more closed the shutters and replaced the blinds from within.|$|R

In 1929 Pérez Concha and Espinel Hector Mendoza founded the first commercial advertising agency in Guayaquil, and it worked for several years until they had to close it down due to the severe economic crisis of the 1930s.|$|R
40|$|Giant marsupials, reptiles, and flightless birds once {{inhabited}} Australia (see {{the first}} figure). But 23 of the 24 genera of these megafauna {{disappeared in the}} late Pleistocene (~ 125 to ~ 12 thousand years ago). Most Australian megafauna appear to have survived until 51 to 40 thousand years ago, with human impact by hunting or vegetation change proposed as the extinction drivers (1 – 4). Yet, one site has stood out as an anomaly: Cuddie <b>Springs</b> in <b>interior</b> New South Wales. Persistent claims have been made that this site contains megafauna fossils associated with stone tools in sediments deposited 40 to 30 thousand years ago (5 – 7), thus indicating prolonged overlap between people and megafauna. These claims have been challenged (2, 8) based on concerns about possible reworking of fossils from older deposits. To resolve this conundrum, Grün et al. (9) have now directly dated the fossils themselves. The results provide no evidence for the late survival of megafauna at the site. Richard G. Roberts and Barry W. Broo...|$|R
50|$|The {{bottling}} {{house is}} also a single story wood frame structure, built in 1929 after the previous building on the site was destroyed by fire. It is architecturally unremarkable, with similar proportions to the <b>spring</b> house. Its <b>interior</b> is largely unfinished, with exposed ceiling rafters and wall joists. The {{southern part of the}} building is taken up by a 900 usgal L tank, lined in granite, with an overflow catchbasin and troughs at which the filling operation took place. At {{the north end of the}} building is a room in which the filled bottles were capped, labelled and packaged for shipping. Much of the original early 20th-century equipment used in these processes remains.|$|R
50|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} July 14, 2003 and continued until August 14, 2003. Most scenes were shot {{in and around}} Sand <b>Springs,</b> Oklahoma. Most <b>interior</b> scenes were shot at Zepper Studios facility, then in Sand Springs. All water scenes were shot at Keystone Lake. The entire shooting schedule was faced with the hottest days recorded for the area in decades. Temperatures rose as high as 118 degrees, which was devastating to the schedule. With 115+ degree weather outdoors, some of the interior scenes were shot in temperatures that approached 125 degrees on the set. At one point, Marina Sirtis suffered heat stroke on the set which resulted in certain scenes being cancelled.|$|R
5000|$|The hollow {{part of the}} {{interior}} box encloses five rayon balls (similar to cotton balls) which are {{in contact with the}} wick. The bottom of this is covered by a piece of felt approximately 1/4 of an inch thick. Printed {{on the bottom of the}} felt (in modern Zippos, not on older models [...] ) are the words, [...] "LIFT TO FILL," [...] to indicate one must lift the felt away from the [...] "cotton" [...] in order to refuel it. The fuel, light petroleum distillate or synthetic isoparaffinic hydrocarbon (commonly referred to as lighter fluid or naphtha), is poured into the rayon balls (sometimes called the [...] "cotton," [...] or the [...] "batting"), which absorbs it. It also contains a tube that holds a short, cylindrical flint. The tube has an <b>interior</b> <b>spring</b> and exterior cap-screw that keeps the flint in constant contact with the exterior flint-wheel. Spinning this rough-surfaced wheel against flint results in a spark that ignites the fluid in the wick.|$|R

2500|$|In 1887, {{the bank}} {{purchased}} {{a plot of}} land along the St. George Avenue (present-day Gediminas Avenue). It measured 702 square Russian fathoms (one Russian fathom is about [...] ). The bank held an architectural competition {{for the design of}} its headquarters and received 17 submissions. The chosen design by architect Vikentijus Gorskis, who was also an employee of the bank, was for a two-floor building with a basement symmetrically designed in the neoclassical and neorenaissance style. The construction started in fall 1889 and was completed by <b>spring</b> 1891. The <b>interior</b> boasted a rich decor, which was restored to its original state in 1994–1997. The building was shared with the Vilnius Private Commercial Bank, established in 1873. In 1910, the building was expended by adding two avant-corps in the inner yard. At the same time, the building was connected with a newly built concert hall (present-day Lithuanian National Drama Theatre) and a residential building creating a complex architectural assemble. In 1928, the vestibule was reconstructed to include revolving door and a white marble dual staircase. In the Lithuanian SSR, the building was used by the Gosbank (State Bank of the Soviet Union) and has served as the headquarters of the Bank of Lithuania since Lithuania's declaration of independence in 1990.|$|R
40|$|Several abrupt climate events {{during the}} Holocene, {{including}} the widely documented oscillation at 8. 2 thousand years before present (ka), {{are attributed to}} changes in the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation. Additional mechanisms, such as interactions between atmospheric circulation, ice-sheet dynamics, and the influence of solar irradiance, also have been proposed to explain abrupt climatic events, but evidence remains elusive. This study presents evidence from multi-proxy analyses on the Holocene sediments of Eleanor Lake, interior British Columbia. Climatic inferences from our decadal-resolution record of biogenic silica (BSi) abundance are supported by changes in diatom and pollen assemblages from the same core and correlations with existing regional climate records. The BSi record reveals abrupt and persistent climatic shifts at 10. 2, 9. 3, and 8. 5 ka, the latter two of which are coeval with major collapses of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The record also reveals a short-term cooling at 8. 2 ka that is distinct from the 8. 5 ka event and similar in magnitude to several other late-Holocene coolings. BSi is correlated with solar-irradiance indices (r = 0. 43 – 0. 61), but the correlation is opposite in sign to that expected from direct solar forcing and weakens after 8 ka. Possible mechanisms causing the abrupt and persistent climate changes of the early Holocene include 1) sudden losses of ice and proglacial lake extent, causing a shift in the meridional structure of atmospheric circulation, 2) a possible link between solar minima and El Niño-like conditions that are correlated with warm <b>spring</b> temperature in <b>interior</b> British Columbia, and 3) the influence of solar irradiance variability on the position of the polar jet, possibly via effects on the strength of the glacial anticyclone. ...|$|R
60|$|Houses {{are only}} meant {{to eat and}} sleep in. The rest of life is lived at full length in the {{verandah}}. When traffic is brisk three whole teams will pass that verandah in one day, and {{it is necessary to}} exchange news about the weather and the prospects for oats. When oats are in there will be slack time on the farm, and the farmers will seriously think of doing the hundred things that they have let slide during the summer. They will undertake this and that, 'when they get around to it.' The phrase translated is the exact equivalent to the mañana of the Spaniard, the kul hojaiga of Upper India, the yuroshii of the Japanese, and the long drawled taihod of the Maori. The only person who 'gets around' in this weather is the summer boarder--the refugee from the burning cities of the Plain, and she is generally a woman. She walks, and botanizes, and kodaks, and strips the bark off the white birch to make blue-ribboned waste-paper baskets, and the farmer regards her with wonder. More does he wonder still at the city clerk in a blazer, who has two weeks' holiday in the year and, apparently, unlimited money, which he earns in the easiest possible way by 'sitting at a desk and writing,' The farmer's wife sees the fashions of the summer boarder, and between them man and woman get a notion of the beauties of city life for which their children may live to blame them. The blazer and the town-made gown are innocent recruiting sergeants for the city brigades; and since one man's profession is ever a mystery to his fellow, blazer and gown believe that the farmer must be happy and content. A summer resort is one of the thousand windows whence to watch the thousand aspects of life in the Atlantic States. Remember that between June and September it is the desire of all who can {{to get away from the}} big cities--not on account of wantonness, as people leave London--but because of actual heat. So they get away in their millions with their millions--the wives of the rich men for five clear months, the others for as long as they can; and, like drawing like, they make communities set by set, breed by breed, division by division, over the length and breadth of the land--from Maine and the upper reaches of the Saguenay, through the mountains and hot <b>springs</b> of half-a-dozen <b>interior</b> States, out and away to Sitka in steamers. Then they spend money on hotel bills, among ten thousand farms, on private companies who lease and stock land for sporting purposes, on yachts and canoes, bicycles, rods, châlets, cottages, reading circles, camps, tents, and all the luxuries they know. But the luxury of rest most of them do not know; and the telephone and telegraph are faithfully dragged after them, lest their men-folk should for a moment forget the ball and chain at foot.|$|R
40|$|Research was {{undertaken}} {{to determine how}} the understory vegetation of Hamilton urban forests compares with reference old-growth forests in rural locations, identify causes for differences, and develop methods to enhance species diversity. Understory vegetation was measured in five rural old-growth forests and compared with 20 urban forests, categorised into four age groups, to assess differences in richness, composition and density. Environmental profiling quantified soil type, nutrient levels, pH, moisture content, understory light transmittance, temperature and vapour pressure deficit of selected forests to identify variation across the forest categories and determine if environmental conditions were the chief cause for vegetative differences. Three native species (Melicytus micranthus, Hedycarya arborea and Coprosma arborea), absent from or less abundant in urban forests, were reintroduced into forest sites to assess their growth, survival and potential for becoming a prominent component in Hamilton City forests. Urban forests displayed reduced native understory diversity comprising only 61. 5 % of the native understory species found in the rural old-growth forests. Native understory species richness and density decreased from the rural old-growth forest category to the youngest urban forest group. Rural old-growth forests averaged 7. 96 species and 41. 28 stems per 50 m² compared to 2. 68 species and 8. 20 stems per 50 m² in the youngest urban forests. The exotic understory stem density trend was reverse. Reduced understory diversity in second-growth and urban forests is widely reported overseas but has not been quantified in New Zealand previously. Soil nutrients and acidity increased from the youngest to the oldest urban forest category. Light transmittance into the understory decreased with forest age from 18. 43 % in the youngest urban forest group to 4. 17 % in the rural old-growth forest category during winter and spring. Buffering patterns were evident in rural oldgrowth forests with higher temperatures and vapour pressure deficits outside the forests by as much as 3 ºC and 0. 3 kPa respectively during the day, compared to the forest interior. Similar patterns were evident in urban forests during <b>spring</b> but the <b>interior</b> temperatures and vapour pressure deficits were not as low, compared to the rural forests. Environmental profiling proved there were significant differences in environmental conditions between the forest categories and that these were within the range of values reported elsewhere in New Zealand. Survival and growth rates between 77. 8 to 100 % and 2. 7 to 12. 1 cm respectively, for the three translocated species over the measured seven months were on par with other New Zealand trials and suggest the selected species can grow and establish viable populations within urban forests. The reintroduction success further indicates that the reduced diversity of urban forests is likely to result from the effects of fragmentation and isolation and urban pressures. Active reintroduction of missing or less abundant native understory species is the best method to improve diversity in Hamilton urban forests. The species experimented with should be included in forest enrichment planting plans as early as 5 to 15 years. Management plans should address active removal of exotic species including methods for manipulation of developing vegetation to favour enhancement of native understory diversity in urban forests...|$|R
