40|$|Presented are {{results from}} trans-limb scans of the 4. 67 -micron (2143 cm- 1) {{fundamental}} rotation-vibration CO lines. The scan sequences {{were used to}} produce 2 -D maps of the CO emission above the solar limb. The data were collected on 08 August 2002 at the McMath-Pierce solar telescope using the infrared spectrometer, a 256 x 256 InSb array detector and an image stabilizing system - the predecessor to the telescope's current prototype adaptive optics system. The spectrograph slit was oriented parallel to the solar limb to minimize scattered photospheric light into the spectrograph for spectra taken above the limb. The image stabilizer was used to accurately step the solar limb in 0. 149 arcsecond increments across the 0. 5 arcsecond slit. Although the image stabilizer canceled image motion in the axis parallel to the solar limb, seeing still distorted and degraded the limb image. Scan sequences were taken at the solar south polar limb to avoid possible active regions in the mid-latitudes. Frame selection techniques were used to construct <b>spectroheliogram</b> images from the best seeing spectral frames resulting in 2 -D images approaching 1 arcsecond resolution. Continuum images were subtracted from CO line center grams resulting in images that clearly show both bright and dark structures in the CO that extend into the above-limb emission.

Cross limb measurements indicate that the strongest of the CO lines extend to roughly 500 km (0. 7 arcseconds) above the solar limb consistent with earlier studies...|$|E
40|$|Various {{observatories}} {{around the}} globe started regular full-disk imaging of the solar atmosphere in the Ca II K line since {{the early decades of}} the 20 th century. The archives made by these observations have the potential of providing far more detailed information on solar magnetism than just the sunspot number and area records to which most studies of solar activity and irradiance changes are restricted. We evaluate the image contents of three Ca II K <b>spectroheliogram</b> time-series, specifically those obtained by the digitization of the Arcetri, Kodaikanal, and Mt Wilson photographic archives. We describe the main problems afflicting these data and analyze their quality by expressing the image contents through several quantities. We compare the results obtained with those for similar present-day observations taken with the Meudon spectroheliograph and with the Rome-PSPT. We show that historic data suffer from stronger geometrical distortions and photometric uncertainties than similar present-day observations. The latter uncertainties mostly originate from the photographic calibration of the original data and from stray-light effects. We also show that the image contents of the three analyzed series vary in time. These variations are probably due to instrument changes and aging of the spectrographs used, as well as changes of the observing programs. Our results imply that the main challenge for the analysis of historic data is their accurate photometric calibration. This problem must be solved before they can provide reliable information about solar magnetism and activity over the last century. Moreover, inter-calibration of results obtained from independent time-series is required to reliably trace changes of solar properties with time from the analysis of such data.

40|$|The Multi-Spectral Solar Telescope Array (MSSTA) is {{a rocket}} borne solar {{observatory}} {{designed to address}} {{a wide range of}} scientific questions relating to two aspects of the structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere: (1) The heating and dynamics of chromospheric and coronal structures including spicules, coronal loops, bright points, and planes; {{and the role of the}} fine scale structure of the chromospheric network in the transport of mass and energy between these structures, and (2) The large scale structures of the corona, including the interface of prominences and filaments with material at coronal temperatures, the transition region structure of coronal holes and plumes, and their relationship to the solar wind. In order to address these fundamental scientific problems, the observational objective of the MSSTA is to obtain a set of high resolution spectroheliograms with the following properties: (1) Sufficiently broad spectral coverage and accurate photometry to allow modeling of structures covering the full range of temperatures observed in non-flaring chromosphere/corona, 10 (exp 4) K to 10 (exp 7) K; (2) Sufficient spectral resolution (lambda / delta lambda approx. 30 - 100) in each <b>spectroheliogram</b> to allow isolation of the emission from lines excited over a narrow range of temperatures; (3) To address objective (a), spatial resolution sufficient to resolve structures on the sun on a scale of 100 - 200 km (0. 1 - 0. 3 arc seconds); to address objective (b), images of the full disk and inner corona with resolution at least 1. 0 arc second, and high sensitivity images of the extended corona (to approx. 3 - 4 solar radii above the limb) with resolution of approx. 3 arc seconds; for both objectives (c), direct measurements of the coronal magnetic field.

Certain differences between the individual plage indices appear to be caused mainly by differences in the spectral passbands used.

40|$|A coronal funnel model, {{developed}} by D. Rabin, was tested against a calibrated <b>spectroheliogram</b> {{recorded in the}} 170 - 1 75 A bandpass. This image was recorded on board a sounding-rocket experiment flown on 1994 November 3, called the Multi-Spectral Solar Telescope Array II (MSSTA II). MSSTA, a joint project of Stanford University, the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory' is an observing platform composed {{of a set of}} normal-incidence, multilayer-coated optics designed to obtain narrow-bandpass, high-resolution images (1 sec. - 3 sec.) at selected far-ultraviolet (FUV), extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), and soft X-ray wavelengths (44 - 1550 A). Using full disk images centered at 1550 A (C IV) and 173 A (Fe IX/X), the funnel model, which is based on coronal back-heating, was tested against the data incorporating observed constraints on global coverage and measured flux. Found was a class of funnel models that could account for the quiescent, globally diffuse and unresolved emission seen in the 171 - 175 A bandpass, where the funnels are assumed to be rooted in the C IV supergranular network. These models, when incorporated with the CHIANTI spectral code, suggest that this emission is mostly of upper transition region origin and primarily composed of Fe IX plasma. The funnels are found to have constrictions, Gamma approx. 6 - 20, which is in good agreement with the observations. Further, the fitted models simultaneously satisfy global areal constraints seen in both images; namely,that a global network of funnels must cover approx. 700 - 95 % of the total solar surface area seen in the 171 - 175 A image, and a 5 % of the disk area seen in the 1550 A bandpass. These findings support the configuration of the EUV magnetic network as suggested by Reeves et al. and put forth in more detail by Gabriel.
