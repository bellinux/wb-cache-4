Restrooms, a kitchen, and a cafe occupied the wings.|$|E
5|$|Augustine consecrated Justus as {{a bishop}} in 604, over a {{province}} including the Kentish town of Rochester. The historian Nicholas Brooks {{argues that the}} choice of Rochester was probably not {{because it had been}} a Roman-era bishopric, but rather because of its importance in the politics of the time. Although the town was small, with just one street, it was at the junction of Watling <b>Street</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> estuary of the Medway, and was thus a fortified town. Because Justus was probably not a monk (he was not called that by Bede), his cathedral clergy was very likely non-monastic too.|$|E

During the electrification of the line in 1957–60 the station was equipped with a bay platform for passenger trains, {{to allow it to}} accommodate both through services to and from Baker <b>Street</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Chalfont& Latimer–Chesham shuttle simultaneously.
