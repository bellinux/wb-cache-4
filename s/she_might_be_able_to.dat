5|$|Taylor {{was named}} to the Aussie Belles that was going to the 2012 Summer Paralympics. That the team {{qualified}} for the Games came as a surprise, as the Australian Paralympic Committee had been working on player development with an idea of the team qualifying for the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and an Australian team had not participated since the 2000 Summer Paralympics, when they earned an automatic selection as hosts, and the team finished last in the competition. Going into the Paralympics, her team was ranked eighth in the world. The Australian Paralympic Committee had chosen to work on her development as a goalball player with the idea that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> qualify for and win a medal at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. Taylor debuted the national team's Paralympic uniform on 1 May 2012 at the Sydney Overseas Passenger Terminal on day two of the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia Spring/Summer 2012/13. In the 2012 Summer Paralympics tournament, the Belles played games against Japan, Canada, the United States and Sweden. They lost every game, and did not advance to the finals.|$|E

25|$|Tunny rendezvoused with Skate on 23 June {{to depart}} the Sea of Japan. She {{remained}} off Hokkaidō {{for two days}} on the chance that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> aid Bonefish, missing since her request to make a daylight submerged patrol of Toyama Wan some days earlier. On 27 June, Tunny discontinued her vigil; proceeded via the Kuril Islands and Midway Island; and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 6 July.|$|E

25|$|The title {{character}} of Babette was initially offered to Catherine Deneuve. Deneuve {{was interested in}} the part but was concerned because she had been criticized in her past attempts to depart from her usual sophisticated woman roles. While Deneuve deliberated for a day, Axel met with French actress Stéphane Audran. Axel remembered Audran from her roles in Claude Chabrol's films Violette Nozière (1978) and Poulet au vinaigre (1985). When Axel asked Chabrol (her former husband) about Audran's suitability, Chabol said Audran was the archetype of Babette. Axel gave the script to Audran, told her that Deneuve was contemplating the role, and asked her if <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> respond before the next day. Audran called two hours later and said she wanted the role. The following day, Deneuve declined and Audran was officially cast.|$|E
25|$|Before the war, Zelle had {{performed}} as Mata Hari {{several times before}} the Crown Prince Wilhelm, eldest son of Kaiser Wilhelm II and nominally a senior German general on the Western Front. The Deuxième Bureau believed <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> obtain information by seducing the Crown Prince for military secrets. In fact, his involvement was minimal and it was German government propaganda that promoted {{the image of the}} Crown Prince as a great warrior, the worthy successor to the august Hohenzollern monarchs who had made Prussia strong and powerful. They wanted to avoid publicizing that the man expected to be the next Kaiser was a playboy noted for womanizing, partying, and indulging in alcohol, who spent another portion of his time intriguing with far right-wing politicians, with the intent to have his father declared insane and deposed.|$|E

6000|$|But {{when she}} found herself alone with him; when she looked into his face, and saw how handsome, how noble, how good it was--good in its {{inherent}} manliness and bravery--she could not but long that this feud should be over, and that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> once more to welcome him as her friend. If only he would give up this frantic passion, this futile, wicked, senseless attempt to make them all wretched by an insane marriage, {{would it not be}} sweet again to make some effort to rescue him from the evil ways into which he had fallen? ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{mathematical}} psychology, antimatroids {{have been}} used to describe feasible states of knowledge of a human learner. Each element of the antimatroid represents a concept that is to be understood by the learner, or a class of problems that he or <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> solve correctly, and the sets of elements that form the antimatroid represent possible sets of concepts that could be understood by a single person. The axioms defining an antimatroid may be phrased informally as stating that learning one concept can never prevent the learner from learning another concept, and that any feasible state of knowledge can be reached by learning a single concept at a time. The task of a knowledge assessment system is to infer the set of concepts known by a given learner by analyzing his or her responses to a small and well-chosen set of problems. In this context antimatroids have also been called [...] "learning spaces" [...] and [...] "well-graded knowledge spaces".|$|E

60|$|He little {{knew how}} sublime, in its {{unconscious}} effrontery, his question was! She tried to compose herself, that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> present comprehensively to his finite masculine mind the ache of today.|$|E
50|$|While in college, Padilla was {{diagnosed}} with Hodgkins Lymphoma and underwent several rounds of chemotherapy and radiation. During this time, Padilla <b>was</b> told that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> never <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to sing again because the radiation could harm her vocal cords. But she would not give up her dream.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} sad, {{because it was}} {{necessary}} that some decision should be made as to the future residence of Mrs. Trevelyan and of Nora. Emily had declared that nothing should induce {{her to go to}} the Islands with her father and mother unless her boy went with her. Since her journey to Casalunga she had also expressed her unwillingness to leave her husband. Her heart had been greatly softened towards him, and she had declared that where he remained, there would she remain,--as near to him as circumstances would admit. It <b>might</b> <b>be</b> that at last her care would be necessary for his comfort. He supplied her with means of living, and she would use these means as well as <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> in his service.|$|R
60|$|De Stancy {{bowed and}} {{departed}} in a glow of triumph; satisfied, notwithstanding her frigidity, {{that he had}} compassed his immediate aim, which <b>was</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to dismiss from her thoughts him and his persevering desire for the shadow of her face during the next four-and-twenty-hours. And his confidence was well founded: she could not.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{shall we}} do with this old crone?" [...] Beorn said. [...] "It would never do to risk her giving an alarm, and though she looks feeble <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get down to Porthwyn." ...|$|E

60|$|She grubbed in {{the garden}} and green-house, and learned hard botanical names that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> talk {{intelligently}} upon subjects that interested her comrade. Then, as autumn ended out-of-door work, she tried to make home more comfortable and attractive than ever.|$|E
60|$|Here was an opportunity. Christie {{resolved}} to profit by it. She did not {{doubt that the}} young fellow had already passed her sister on the trail, but, from bashfulness, had not dared to approach her. By inviting his confidence, she would doubtless draw something from him that would deny or corroborate her father's opinion of his sentiments. If he was really in love with Jessie, she would learn what reasons he had for expecting a serious culmination of his suit, and perhaps <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> delicately to open {{his eyes to the}} truth. If, as she believed, it was only a boyish fancy, she would laugh him out of it with that camaraderie which had always existed between them. A half motherly sympathy, albeit born quite as much from a contemplation of his beautiful yearning eyes as from his interesting position, lightened the smile with which she greeted him.|$|R
60|$|He put {{the child}} into bed wrapped {{as she was}} in the shawl, for the sheets would be cold. Then he <b>was</b> afraid that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to move her arms, so he {{loosened}} her. The black eyes opened, rested on him vacantly, sank shut again. He covered her up. The last little quiver from the sobbing shook her breathing.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{poor woman}} {{that had been a}} kind of a {{dependent}} upon our family, and whom I had often, among the rest of the relations, been very kind to; my maid put it into my head one morning to send to this poor woman, and to see whether <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to help in this dreadful case.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{took it for}} the night," [...] {{said his}} wife hurriedly. [...] "Poor thing, what with the others being ill she’s ’ad a dreadful time, and she said if I’d take Charlie for a few—for a night, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get some sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! that is {{more than}} I can tell," [...] the sailor replied. [...] "Methinks 'twill blow from the west. In that case, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> make her way along the shore; she might run into port for shelter; she might be blown out to sea." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Channing {{walked on}} in silence. She must help Constance, but Constance was not easily helped. When school reopened, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> do {{something}} worthwhile for the girl, but just {{now the only}} thing to do was to put her {{in the way of a}} pleasant vacation.|$|E
60|$|She {{knew nothing}} about it. He {{carefully}} explained the method by which a moderate sum of money <b>might</b> <b>be</b> made to purchase a sufficient income for life. She offered no objection, when he proposed to write to his lawyer in London for the necessary particulars. But when {{he asked her to}} tell him what the sum <b>was</b> of which <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> still <b>able</b> to dispose, Iris hesitated, and made no reply.|$|R
50|$|Affliction {{finally took}} hold of Emily Gilmour, the disease sure of its prey, {{no matter how long}} it would be in {{securing}} it. Six weeks before the end came they talked over spiritual things, lest later <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to speak of them. In simple, childlike faith, on September 19, 1885, she died and the eleven years of happy married life were brought to an end.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the NYCB’s Balanchine ’s 50th Anniversary Celebration, Ansanelli had {{a severe}} foot injury, sidelining her for two years and almost ending her career. In Roslyn Sulcas’ New York Times article, Saturday, June 6, 2002, “A Young Survivor in an Unforgiving World”, it was {{described}} that after multiple prognosis’s and diagnosis’s she was told many times that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to dance again. During that period she completed high school.|$|R
60|$|Fergus {{remained}} {{three months}} at home. Thirza was {{delighted with the}} country, and the affection shown by the people to Fergus; and studied diligently to learn the language, that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> communicate personally with them, and above all with Mrs. Drummond, to whom she speedily became much attached.|$|E
60|$|Harold {{looked at}} her and felt that if he had {{anything}} to say the time had come for him to say it, and that she had brought him here in order that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> listen undisturbed. So he began again, and told her that he loved her dearly.|$|E
60|$|To {{this the}} prince agreed, and they {{consulted}} together over a plan by which <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> make her escape and return with him into Persia. And {{as the first}} step, she was to dress herself with care, and receive the Sultan with civility when he visited her next morning.|$|E
60|$|Wickham, Lydia, {{were all}} forgotten. Jane was beyond {{competition}} her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger sisters {{soon began to}} make interest with her for objects of happiness which <b>she</b> <b>might</b> in future <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to dispense.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} {{they came to the}} pine-trees Miriam was getting very eager and very tense. Her bush <b>might</b> <b>be</b> gone. <b>She</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to find it; and she wanted it so much. Almost passionately she wanted to be with him when he stood before the flowers. They {{were going to have a}} communion together--{{something}} that thrilled her, something holy. He was walking beside her in silence. They were very near to each other. She trembled, and he listened, vaguely anxious.|$|R
5000|$|Nessarose and Elphaba {{are almost}} {{diametrically}} opposite {{in terms of}} personality. Elphaba is an atheist, who does not even believe in a soul, and Nessarose ends up provoking her sister's ire by constantly praying for Elphaba's soul. Nevertheless, Nessarose pleads with Elphaba {{to stay with her}} in the East and help her rule Munchkinland, and although Elphaba spurns and abandons her younger sister, she later regrets it when Nessarose is destroyed (wondering whether <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to save Nessie had she herself been there).|$|R
