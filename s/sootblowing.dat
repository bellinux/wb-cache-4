40|$|Coal-fired {{units are}} {{increasingly}} expected {{to operate at}} varying loads while simultaneously dealing with various operational influences as well as fuel variations. Maintaining unit load availability while managing adverse effects of various operational issues such as, flue gas temperature excursions at the SCR inlet, high steam temperatures and the like presents significant challenges. Dynamic adjustment of <b>sootblowing</b> activities and different operational parameters is required to effectively control slagging, fouling and achieve reliability in unit operation. Closed-loop optimizers aim to reduce ongoing manual adjustments by control operators and provide consistency in unit operation. Such optimizers are typically computer software-based and work by interfacing an algorithmic and/or artificial intelligence based decision making system to plant control system [1]. KCP&L {{is in the process}} of implementing Siemens SPPA-P 3000 combustion and <b>sootblowing</b> optimizers at several Units. The <b>Sootblowing</b> Optimizer solution determines the need for <b>sootblowing</b> based on dynamic plant operating conditions, equipment availability and plant operational drivers. The system then generates sootblower activation signals for propagation in a closed-loop manner to the existing sootblower control system at ‘optimal ’ times. SPPA-P 3000 <b>Sootblowing</b> Optimizer has been successfully installed at Hawthorn Unit 5, a 594 -MW, wall-fired boiler, firing 100 percent Powder River Basin coal.

40|$|Renewable {{energy sources}} are {{essential}} paths towards sustainable development and CO 2 emission reduction. For example, the European Union {{has set the}} target of achieving 22 % of electricity generation from renewable sources by 2010. However, the extensive use of this energy source is being avoided by some technical problems as fouling and slagging in the surfaces of boiler heat exchangers. Although these phenomena were extensively studied in the last decades in order to optimize the behaviour of large coal power boilers, a simple, general and effective method for fouling control has not been developed. For biomass boilers, the feedstock variability {{and the presence of}} new components in ash chemistry increase the fouling influence in boiler performance. In particular, heat transfer is widely affected and the boiler capacity becomes dramatically reduced. Unfortunately, the classical approach of regular <b>sootblowing</b> cycles becomes clearly insufficient for them. Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides new means to undertake this problem. This paper illustrates a methodology based on Neural Networks (NNs) and Fuzzy-Logic Expert Systems to select the moment for activating <b>sootblowing</b> in an industrial biomass boiler. The main aim is to minimize the boiler energy and efficiency losses with a proper <b>sootblowing</b> activation. Although the NN type used in this work is well-known and the Hybrid Systems had been extensively used in the last decade, the excellent results obtained in the use of AI in industrial biomass boilers control with regard to previous approaches makes this work a novelty...|$|E
40|$|A unique {{test program}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate flue gas-side fouling and cleaning performance characteristics of a heat exchanger tube bundle for application in coal-fired environments. The test bundle contained helically finned tubes in a staggered arrangement. Air sootblowers were installed upstream and downstream of the test bundle to evaluate cleaning effectiveness during the fouling test. The bundle was installed in the outlet flue of a coal-fired test boiler to simulate flue gas and friable flyash conditions of a pulverized-coal-fired utility or industrial boiler. Thermal and hydraulic performance characteristics were measured {{to determine the effects}} of fouling and sootblower cleaning on bundle heat transfer and pressure drop. Results showed that ash deposits were controllable by <b>sootblowing</b> and that the bundle did not plug. The maximum fouling factor depended on <b>sootblowing</b> frequency, and there was no measurable increase in bundle pressure drop. Fouling-factor data were correlated against time, bundle geometry, and flue gas conditions for the two coals tested.

40|$|Boiler {{combustion}} dynamics change continuously due {{to several}} factors including coal quality, boiler loading, ambient conditions, changes in slag/soot deposits and {{the condition of}} plant equipment. NO{sub x} formation, Particulate Matter (PM) emissions, and boiler thermal performance are directly affected by the <b>sootblowing</b> practices on a unit. As part of its Power Plant Improvement Initiative program, the US DOE is providing cofunding (DE-FC 26 - 02 NT 41425) and NETL is the managing agency for this project at Tampa Electric's Big Bend Station. This program serves to co-fund projects that {{have the potential to}} increase thermal efficiency and reduce emissions from coal-fired utility boilers. A review of the Big Bend units helped identify intelligent <b>sootblowing</b> as a suitable application to achieve the desired objectives. The existing sootblower control philosophy uses sequential schemes, whose frequency is either dictated by the control room operator or is timed based. The intent of this project is to implement a neural network based intelligent soot-blowing system, in conjunction with state-of-the-art controls and instrumentation, to optimize the operation of a utility boiler and systematically control boiler fouling. Utilizing unique, online, adaptive technology, operation of the sootblowers can be dynamically controlled based on real-time events and conditions within the boiler. This could be an extremely cost-effective technology, which has the ability to be readily and easily adapted to virtually any pulverized coal fired boiler. Through unique on-line adaptive technology, Neural Network-based systems optimize the boiler operation by accommodating equipment performance changes due to wear and maintenance activities, adjusting to fluctuations in fuel quality, and improving operating flexibility. The system dynamically adjusts combustion setpoints and bias settings in closed-loop supervisory control to simultaneously reduce {sub x} emissions and improve heat rate around the clock...|$|E
40|$|Combustion Specialists, Inc. {{has just}} {{completed}} a project designed to develop the capability to monitor and control the formation of deposits {{on the outside of}} boiler tubes inside an operating kraft recovery furnace. This project, which was carried out in the period from April 1, 2001 to January 31, 2003, was funded by the Department of Energy's Inventions and Innovations program. The primary objectives of the project included the development and demonstration of the ability to produce clear images of deposits throughout the convective sections of operating recovery boilers using newly developed infrared imaging technology, to demonstrate the automated detection and quantification of these deposits using custom designed image processing software developed as part of the project, and to demonstrate the feasibility of all technical elements required for a commercial ''smart'' <b>sootblowing</b> control system based on direct feedback from automated imaging of deposits in real-time. All of the individual tasks have been completed and all objectives have been substantially achieved. Imaging of deposits throughout the convective sections of several recovery boilers has been demonstrated, a design for a combined sootblower/deposit inspection probe has been developed and a detailed heat transfer analysis carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of this design, an improved infrared imager which can be sufficiently miniaturized for this application has been identified, automated deposit detection software has been developed and demonstrated, a detailed design for all the necessary communications and control interfaces has been developed, and a test has been carried out in a glass furnace to demonstrate the applicability of the infrared imaging sensor in that environment.

40|$|Acousticlean Sonic Sootblowers, or 'horns' are low frequency, {{high energy}} {{acoustical}} devices which offer a low-cost approach to cleaning {{many areas of}} the boiler and its associated equipment. The horns are presently in use and/or are being evaluated at more than 50 sites in the U. S., and at many more in Europe, where the technology originated. This paper describes five industrial applications of the horns to solve operating problems in varied industries. The applications discussed include utilization in pulp mill hog fuel boilers to substantially reduce steam lancing requirements; use in recovery boiler precipitators to reduce salt cake buildups; maintenance of clean economizer sections in oil field steam generators; waste fuel boilers; and precipitator dust minimization in smelting operations.

40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{performed}} {{to determine the effects}} of blending eastern bituminous coals with western subbituminous coals on utility boiler operation. Relative to the baseline bituminous coal, the testing reported here indicated that there were significant impacts to boiler performance due to the blending of the eastern and western coals. Results indicated that fuel blending can be used to adequately control flue gas emissions of both SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} at the expense of reduced milling efficiency, increased <b>sootblowing</b> in the high-temperature and low-temperature regions of the boiler and, to a lesser extent, decreased collection efficiency for an electrostatic precipitator. The higher reactivity of the subbituminous coal increased the overall combustion efficiency, which may tend to decrease the impact of milling efficiency losses. The extent of these impacts was directly related to the percentage of subbituminous coal in the blends. At the lowest blend ratios of subbituminous coal, the impacts were greatly reduced...|$|E
40|$|Removal of fireside {{deposits}} {{from the}} heat transfer tubes in kraft recovery boilers is carried out by <b>sootblowing</b> and occasionally "chill-and- blow" practices. During chill-and-blow, black liquor flow is reduced to rapidly cool the deposits. Thermal stresses generated in the deposit {{as a result of}} thermal shock can effectively weaken the deposit, facilitating its cleaning. For this study, we investigated the mechanical weakening effect of thermal stresses generated by the transient temperature gradients. We quantified the mechanical weakening effect due to thermal shock by measuring the decrease in biaxial flexure strength of a preheated sodium chloride disk at various quenching times and surface heat transfer coefficients. We observed that the mechanical weakening occured by transient thermal stresses as well as crack propagation. Approximately 35 % loss in biaxial flexure strength could be achieved at heat transfer coefficients above 3. 3 · 103 W/m 2 K, and at quenching durations above 40 s...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] PU for CHE, 1999. Lethabo Power Station burns {{a unique}} low grade coal with low {{volatile}} content. This merits the optimisation {{of the total}} combustion air quantity with efficiency as main criterion to produce an air flowsteam flow curve {{as a function of}} load as well as coal quality. This project demonstrates the optimisation exercise of the unit as a whole, including the boiler as well as the turbine (a 600 MW turbo-alternator set), therefore producing optimum air flow quantities different to the conventional wisdom. Ninety tests were performed with varying total air flow, at five loads ranging from full load to lowest load with three different coal qualities. The application of the Station Thermal Efficiency Program (STEP) as optimising tool employs a simultaneous direct and indirect calculation method (opposed to the traditional indirect only methods and programs). The test results were used to customise the targets of the STEP program for Lethabo as well as to introduce new philosophies in the formulae. The expected trend of higher unit efficiencies with resulting improved total emissions were confirmed. In the process operational enhancements such as new milling plant settings and <b>sootblowing</b> philosophies were also confirmed to contribute to the improved efficiencies. The findings were operationally implemented which included statutory procedurisation. Doctora...|$|E
40|$|Cost {{effective}} {{generation of}} electricity {{is vital to the}} economic growth and stability of this nation. To accomplish this goal a balanced portfolio of fuel sources must be maintained and established which not only addresses the cost of conversion of these energy sources to electricity, but also does so in an efficient and environmentally sound manner. Conversion of coal as an energy source to produce steam for a variety of systems has been a cornerstone of modern industry. However, the use of coal in combustion systems has traditionally produced unacceptable levels of gaseous and particulate emissions, albeit that recent combustion, removal and mitigation techniques have drastically reduced these levels. With the combustion of coal there is always the formation and deposition of ash and slag within the boilers. This adversely affects the rate at which heat is transferred to the working fluid, which in the case of electric generators is water/steam. The fouling of the boiler leads to poor efficiencies {{due to the fact that}} heat which could normally be transferred to the working fluid remains in the flue gas stream and exits to the environment without beneficial use. This loss in efficiency translates to higher consumption of fuel for equivalent levels of electric generation; hence more gaseous emissions are also produced. Another less obvious problem exists with fouling of various sections of the boiler creating intense peak temperatures within and around the combustion zone. Total nitrogen oxides (NOx) generation is primarily a function of both ''fuel'' and ''thermal'' NOx production. Fuel NOx which generally comprises 20 %- 40 % of the total NOx generated is predominantly influenced by the levels of oxygen present, while thermal NOx which comprises the balance is a function of temperature. As the fouling of the boiler increases and the rate of heat transfer decreases, peak temperatures increase as does the thermal NOx production. Due to the composition of coal, particulate matter is also a by-product of coal combustion. Modern day utility boilers are usually fitted with electrostatic precipitators to aid in the collection of particulate matter. Although extremely efficient, these devices are sensitive to rapid changes in inlet mass concentration as well as total mass loading. Traditionally, utility boilers are equipped with devices known as sootblowers, which use, steam, water or air to dislodge and clean the surfaces within the boiler and are operated based upon established rule or operator's judgment. Poor <b>sootblowing</b> regimes can influence particulate mass loading to the electrostatic precipitators. The project applied a neural network intelligent <b>sootblowing</b> system in conjunction with state-of-the-art controls and instruments to optimize the operation of a utility boiler and systematically control boiler slagging/fouling. This optimization process targeted reduction of NOx of 30 %, improved efficiency of 2 % and a reduction in opacity of 5 %. The neural network system proved to be a non-invasive system which can readily be adapted to virtually any utility boiler. Specific conclusions from this neural network application are listed below. These conclusions should be used in conjunction with the specific details provided in the technical discussions of this report to develop a thorough understanding of the process...|$|E

The CZD-FGD system, installed at Pennsylvania Electric Company`s (Penelec`s) Seward Power Station, was designed to remove 50 % of the SO{sub 2 } from one-half of Unit No. 5 `s flue gas when the boiler is fired with 1. 5 % sulfur coal.

40|$|Design {{work has}} been {{completed}} for a Gas Reburning-Sorbent Injection (GR-SI) system to reduce emissions of NO{sub x} and SO{sub 2 } from a wall fired unit at Central Illinois Light Company`s Edwards Station Unit 1, located in Bartonville, Illinois. The goal {{of the project was}} to reduce emissions of NO{sub x} by 60 %, from the as found baseline of 0. 98 lb/MBtu and to reduce emissions of SO{sub 2 } by 50 %. Since the unit currently fires a blend of high sulfur Illinois coal and low sulfur Kentucky coal to meet an SO{sub 2 } limit of 1. 8 lb/MBtu, the goal at this site was amended to meeting this limit while increasing the fraction of high sulfur coal to 57 % from the current 15 % level. GR-SI requires injection of natural gas into the furnace {{at the level of the}} top burner row, creating a fuel-rich zone in which NO{sub x} formed in the coal zone is reduced to N{sub 2 }. Recycled flue gas is used to increase the reburning fuel jet momentum, resulting in enhanced mixing. Recycled flue gas is also used to cool the top row of burners which would not be in service during GR operation. Dry hydrated lime sorbent is injected into the upper furnace to react with SO{sub 2 }, forming solid CaSO{sub 4 } and CaSO{sub 3 }, which are collected by the ESP. The system was designed to inject sorbent at a rate corresponding to a calcium (sorbent) to sulfur (coal) molar ratio of 2. 0. The SI system design was optimized with respect to gas temperature, injection air flow rate, and sorbent dispersion. Sorbent injection air flow is equal to 3 % of the combustion air. The design includes modifications of the ESP, <b>sootblowing,</b> and ash handling systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermochemical}} equilibrium calculations {{indicate that}} at the temperature of a propane [...] air flame, some volatilization of uranium, plutonium, technetium, and cesium will occur. The expected concentrations of plutonium, technetium, and cesium in the flame will be very low {{because of the small}} maximum concentration of these elements in the projected feed materials for the first 30 -day test. The quantities volatilized can generally be decreased by operating the flame in a fuel-rich mode, although this will lead to greater carbon monoxide production, which may be more objectionable. The concentrations of chlorine and fluorine, at least at the maximum levels in the projected Vortec feed, are not projected to greatly influence the vaporization rates. Therefore, blending to reduce the concentrations of those elements would most likely not be effective in reducing metal vaporization. Most of the elements vaporized condense by the time the gas cools to 2000 F. These elements would condense either on surfaces near the front of the heat recuperator or on entrained particulates or homogeneously as relatively pure submicron particles. Cesium would be expected to condense at the lower temperatures near the rear of the recuperator, although the expected maximum concentration in the Vortec feed material is extremely low so it should be greatly diluted by other particulates. The elements that condense on other entrained particles will form enriched surface coatings. Particles larger than 10 {micro}m or so will be collected in the scrubber. Smaller particles, especially the submicron particles formed from homogeneous nucleation, should be largely collected in the HEPA filter. Deposits formed in the heat recuperator can normally be handled via <b>sootblowing.</b> To reduce handling problems, we suggest that the recuperator be oriented vertically so that the deposits blown off of the heat exchanger fall directly into the molten glass. The large size of the deposits should help to reduce the rate of revaporization, allowing the volatile elements to be removed with the glass. The volatile elements that do not deposit on system surfaces will be concentrated in the smaller particles. Therefore, the HEPA ash will be greatly enriched in these elements. If the HEPA filter is itself sent to a melter, the elements may revaporize and multiply the problems related to metal vaporization significantly. Therefore, the HEPA filters should be disposed of without high-temperature processing. Also, to reduce the formation of these very small particles, it is helpful to include in the feed larger particles to act as condensation nuclei that can then be collected in the scrubber. This can be accomplished by using feed materials with a fraction consisting of particles small enough {{that they will not be}} collected in the cyclone in the melter, but large enough that they will easily be collected by the scrubber. This is one advantage that firing bituminous coal has over gas firing; it provides a source of ash particles of the right size range to serve as nucleation sites, but large enough (depending on the coal) so that they can usually be collected efficiently in the scrubber system...|$|E
40|$|This project {{encompassed}} the design, development, {{and demonstration}} of integrated online optimization systems at Dynegy Midwest Generation's Baldwin Energy Complex (BEC) located in Baldwin, Illinois. The overall project {{objective was to}} improve coal-based generation's emission profile, efficiency, maintenance requirements and plant asset life {{in order to enhance}} the long-term viability of the United States abundant coal resources. Five separate but integrated optimization products were developed, addressing combustion, <b>sootblowing,</b> SCR operations, overall unit thermal performance, and plant-wide availability optimization. Optimization results are inherently unit-specific and cannot be known for a particular generating unit in advance. However, NeuCo believed that the following were reasonable targets for the completed, integrated set of products: Furnace NOx reduction improvement by 5 %, Heat rate improvement by 1. 5 %, Increase of annual Available MWh by 1. 5 %, Commensurate reductions in greenhouse gases, mercury, and particulates; and Commensurate increases in profitability from lower costs, improved reliability, and greater commercial availability. The goal during Phase I was to establish each system and demonstrate their integration in unified plant optimization. Efforts during Phase I focused on: (1) developing, deploying, integrating, and testing prototypes for each of the five products; (2) identifying and addressing issues required for the products to integrate with plant operations; and (3) systematically collecting and assimilating feedback to improve subsequent product releases. As described in the Phase II continuation application NeuCo successfully achieved the goal for Phase I. The goal of Phase II was to improve upon the products installed and tested in Phase I and to quantify the benefits of the integrated system. As this report documents, NeuCo has also successfully achieved the goal for Phase II. The overall results of the project, compared with the project goals, are: (1) NOx Reduction: The 5 % target for NOx reduction was exceeded with average CEMS and SCR Inlet (furnace) NOx reduction of between 12 % and 14 %. (2) Heat Rate Improvement: The optimization systems delivered an average heat rate improvement of between 0. 67 % and 0. 7 %. This falls short of the 1. 5 % heat rate improvement target largely because Cyclone Stability (availability) and CEMS and SCR Inlet NOx were prioritized over heat rate in the event they needed to be traded-off with one another. A different prioritization of objectives could have driven a different balance, thereby meeting the target of 1. 5 % improvement. There were also several factors that could have been masking greater heat rate improvements such as the decrease in fuel density {{over the course of the}} project and the impact of actions taken as a result of advice provided by the optimizers that are difficult to quantify. (3) Increased Annual Available MWh: Although difficult to measure precisely, the target of increasing available MWh's by 1. 5 % was met by providing prioritized alerts and knowledge-based diagnostics for a wide array of plant equipment and process anomalies; helping the plant to move from high sulfur, high Btu Illinois coal to PRB and run that fuel at low stoichiometries without derates; and improved management of cyclone flame quality as well as improved vigilance with respect to cyclone conditions which avoided some degree of temporary de-rate due to cyclone slag build up. (4) Commensurate Reductions in Greenhouse Gases, Mercury, and Particulates: Reductions in all three of these indices can be associated directly with the optimization leverage observed in the heat rate and NOx reductions. (5) Commensurate Increases in Profitability from Lower Costs, Improved Reliability, and Greater Commercial Availability: Commensurate improvements in costs, reliability and availability resulted from the previously described benefits. Also playing a role were the sustained operation of the cyclones while using more available, less expensive but off-design fuel; more effective catalytic reduction of NOx; and the reduced time required to discover, prioritize and diagnose plant equipment issues. The total annual dollar value of the benefits associated with the products installed, refined, and commercialized at BEC are estimated to range from $ 1. 8 to $ 3. 2 million dollars per-unit, and $ 7. 2 to $ 8. 1 million dollars per year plant-wide depending on whether CO{sub 2 } benefits are included. In summary, the NeuCo project at BEC was successfully completed and has demonstrated that advanced optimization technologies can play an important role in improving the environmental footprint of coal-based power generation while achieving other important operating objectives...|$|E
