40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the formation of}} slug flow in horizontal pipes. We found that a slug {{is characterized by the}} memory of the turbulent stresses that formed it. However, the history of other turbulent fluctuations downstream the pipe is destroyed by passing slugs, preventing the formation of new slugs during and after their passage. As a result, the frequency of slug formation downstream the pipe is reduced. A probabilistic model is provided by making use of integral scales of turbulence in pipe flow and probabilistic effects of the properties of slug formation along the pipe. The model can act as a fundamental <b>scientific</b> <b>guideline</b> towards the design of gas-liquid horizontal pipe flow. Predictions by the model were compared with slug frequency measurements found in literature. The agreement between the predictions and the measurements supports the idea that the turbulent fluctuations at the interface are responsible for the formation of slugs...|$|R

50|$|Since {{his early}} childhood, Rami Ollaik was {{introduced}} to beekeeping through his father. He joined the American University in Beirut (AUB) to study agriculture, the field closest to beekeeping at the time. His first scientific approach to the bee world was his MS thesis dealing with economic and marketing modeling of apiculture in Lebanon. Afterwards in 1998, he started conducting applied research on local honeybees, as well as imported strains, {{in order to assess}} their productivity and adaptivity to local production conditions and thus arrive at a superior stock. While pursuing his doctorate studies at the University of Florida, Ollaik expanded his expertise and exposure to the international practices related to bees and beekeeping. Rami’s passion for bees led him to carry on his father’s work of developing the beekeeping industry all over Lebanon through teaching, research and extension services at AUB. Ollaik was the first to introduce beekeeping into the curriculum of AUB’s Faculty of Agriculture & Food Sciences, designed Lebanon’s first beekeepers calendar, improved local beekeeping cultural practices along modern scientific lines, focused on integrated pest management systems and added <b>scientific</b> <b>guidelines</b> to honey production and marketing. He organized at AUB the first and second national scientific conferences for the improvement and modernization of beekeeping practices.|$|E

5000|$|Specifically {{targeting}} depression, Schulberg, Raue, & Rollman (2002) reviewed 12 {{randomized controlled}} trials (RCT’s) that examined evidence-based treatments for major depression (interpersonal psychotherapy & cognitive-behavior therapy) and problem-solving therapy, compared to usual care by PCP’s (i.e. antidepressant medication, drug placebo, or unspecified control). The authors concluded that evidence-based psychotherapies adapted {{for the primary}} care setting are comparable to pharmacotherapy alone and superior to PCP’s usual care. The use of brief evidence-based psychotherapies, such as those reviewed by Schulberg et al., 2002, are fundamental within the PCBH model. The PCBH model emphasizes a problem-focused and functional-contextual approach to assessment and treatment of behavioral health and mental disorders. Wolf and Hopko’s (2008) recent review of treatments for depression in primary care concluded that adaptations of CBT for depression in primary care are [...] "probably efficacious." [...] Research also shows that providing basic training in CBT to PCPs {{is not enough to}} produce robust clinical outcomes (King et al., 2002); highlighting the importance of the BHC’s integrated role in primary care. With respect to the impact of behavioral health consultation on pharmacological treatment of major and minor depression, compared to usual care Katon et al. (1995) found improved medication adherence, increased patient satisfaction with treatment, and overall greater improvements in mood over time for major depression. Inclusion of a behavioral health professional in the treatment of depression in primary care improves outcomes, patient and physician satisfaction, and costs less than usual care. The PCBH model prioritizes the usage of treatment algorithms based on <b>scientific</b> <b>guidelines</b> that include pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. [...] This approach seeks to ensure that patients receive the safest and most effective treatments available.|$|E

40|$|The German Aerospace Center and the University of Applied Sciences Bremen are {{developing}} the nanosatellite ’AISat’ for in-orbit ship tracking. It {{is scheduled for}} launch in autumn 2012 as secondary payload on an Indian ’PSLV’ launcher system. The thesis deals {{with the development of}} the mission operations plan of the satellite for the early mission phases {{as well as for the}} future scientific use of the satellite. The main challenge is the dynamic of the satellite system due to the high orbital velocity of the spacecraft, which leads to strongly changing power conditions as well as strong reduction of the duration of possible communication opportunities. An approach for mission scheduling, which is based on two mathematical models, is used. Both models are developed to predict all properties of the satellite, which are relevant for mission scheduling: An analytic model for easy mission scheduling and a non-linear simulation model, which allows more accurate prediction of the satellite behaviour and is used to verify the operation schedule. The main achievements of the thesis are the command list for autonomous satellite operations during early mission phases, the operation plan to perform the commissioning phase as well as a <b>scientific</b> <b>guideline</b> for the routine mission operations, which will directly influence the mission operations manual for the actual operations starting in autumn 2012. A secondary achievement is the development of a simulation model of the satellite, which will support the operator during critical mission phases. Additionally an approach for providing information concerning the capabilities and constraints of the spacecraft was developed. The results are tables, which allow analysing the power and data handling capabilities in respect to certain mission schedules very fast and intuitive, hence allowing much more efficient mission operations planning...|$|R
