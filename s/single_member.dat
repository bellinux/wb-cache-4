America should only be ruled by the natives when there is no longer a Spaniard there. If even a <b>single</b> <b>member</b> of the Central Junta of Seville were to land on our shores, we should receive him as the Sovereign.|$|E

5|$|The {{most recent}} {{substantial}} {{revision of the}} election law came in February 2015, and was partially upheld by the Constitutional Court in September 2015. An element of preferential voting was introduced by letting voters choose not only {{for a list of}} candidates, but also a <b>single</b> <b>member</b> of the same list. If the percentage of votes for a candidate exceeds 10%, they are elected as if it was an open list system. The list ranking is maintained for those candidates that do not meet this quota.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} d'Hondt {{formula is}} applied to the vote (except for the twelfth constituency in which national minority representatives are elected), with a five-percent election threshold in each constituency. Since 2015, the parliamentary elections have an element of preferential voting by letting voters choose not only for a list of candidates, but also a <b>single</b> <b>member</b> of the same list.

The GRC scheme was brought into existence on 1 June 1988 by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1988 and the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 1988.|$|E
5|$|Under the Northwest Territories Act 1880 the {{district}} was mandated at its inception {{to return a}} <b>single</b> <b>member</b> to the Northwest Territories Legislature under the First Past the Post electoral system.

A <b>single</b> <b>member</b> of the party had fashioned a small canoe from canvas and willow, and the survivors had been obliged to cross the river one at a time using the makeshift canoe.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution further {{provides}} for the composition of a parliament which encompasses members of parliament (MPs) elected through <b>Single</b> <b>Member</b> Constituencies and Group Representation Constituencies, Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs). MPs are representatives of the electorate and have the role of raising concerns that the people may have. The Government's view is that representative democracy is better understood as regarding political parties rather than individual MPs as the fundamental element in the political system. While the judiciary is not a direct manifestation {{of the concept of}} representative democracy, it serves as a check on the Government and the legislature by ensuring that their powers are exercised within the limits established by the Constitution, such as the fundamental liberties in Part IV.|$|E
5|$|The GRC scheme {{came into}} effect on 1 June 1988. Prior to that date, all {{constituencies}} were <b>Single</b> <b>Member</b> Constituencies (SMCs). Now, the Parliamentary Elections Act (Cap. 218, 2008 Rev. Ed.) ("PEA") states {{that there must}} be at least eight SMCs, and the number of MPs to be returned by all GRCs cannot be {{less than a quarter of}} the total number of MPs. Within those parameters the total number of SMCs and GRCs in Singapore and their boundaries are not fixed but are decided by the Cabinet, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee.|$|E
50|$|Some {{residents}} {{reported being}} pressured to vote, or for whom to vote.

5|$|The {{legislative}} branch {{consists of the}} Gyeongju City Council, with 21 members as of 2009. The present City Council was formed from the merger of the old Gyeongju City Council with the Wolseong County Council in 1991. Most subdivisions of Gyeongju elect a <b>single</b> <b>member</b> to represent them in the Council, but Angang-eup is represented by two members because of its large population, {{and two of the}} representatives serve combined districts composed of two dong. Like the mayor, the council members were last elected in 2006, except for a small number elected in more recent by-elections.|$|E
5|$|The series {{travels to}} various churches and congregations {{to have a}} single, unsuspecting member of the church {{presented}} with potential suitors. Each episode begins at the setting of a church service, with host Natalie Grant appearing to introduce the show. A <b>single</b> <b>member</b> of the congregation is introduced {{to his or her}} surprise, while members of the congregation then nominate other single members of the congregation as suitors. The number of suitors is immediately narrowed down to four; they are the top three as voted by the congregation and a fourth chosen by the pastor or minister.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of {{constituencies}} (electoral divisions) in Singapore: <b>Single</b> <b>Member</b> Constituencies (SMCs) and Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). In SMCs candidates vie individually for parliamentary seats, whereas in GRCs the contest is between teams of candidates. Under the GRC scheme, which came into effect on 1 June 1988, the Government may, having regard to the number of voters in a particular constituency, advise the President to declare it to be a GRC and designate it as a constituency in which {{at least one of the}} candidates is from the Malay community, or from the Indian or some other minority community in Singapore. Each team in a GRC may have between three and six candidates.|$|E
