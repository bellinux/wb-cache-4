There the decoupling of the individual supply voltages on the circuit board is difficult to realize due to parasitic inductances of the supply lines. A <b>standard</b> <b>solution</b> with conventional ceramic capacitors requires the parallel use of many conventional MLCC chips with different capacitance values. Here X2Y capacitors are able to replace up to five equal-sized ceramic capacitors on the PCB. However, this particular type of ceramic capacitor is patented, so these components are still comparatively expensive.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>standard</b> <b>solution</b> to the {{measurement}} {{problem is the}} [...] "Orthodox" [...] or [...] "Cophenhagen" [...] interpretation, which claims that the wave function collapses {{as the result of}} a measurement by an observer or apparatus external to the quantum system. An alternative interpretation, the Many-worlds Interpretation, was first described by Hugh Everett in 1957 (where it was called the relative state interpretation, the name Many-worlds was coined by Bryce Seligman DeWitt starting in the 1960s and finalized in the 70s). His formalism of quantum mechanics denied that a measurement requires a wave collapse, instead suggesting that all that is truly necessary of a measurement is that a quantum connection is formed between the particle, the measuring device, and the observer.|$|E

50|$|To {{determine}} {{the amount of}} water in the sample, analysis must first be performed using either back or direct titration.

The back-titration method is similar, but involves the addition of an excess of the reagent. This excess is then consumed by adding a known amount of a <b>standard</b> <b>solution</b> with known water content. The result reflects the water content of the sample and the <b>standard</b> <b>solution.</b> Since the amount of water in the <b>standard</b> <b>solution</b> is known, the difference reflects the water content of the sample.|$|E
