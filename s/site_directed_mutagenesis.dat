40|$|Introduction Phospholipase Cb 1 (PLC-β 1) is a {{key player}} in the {{regulation}} of nuclear inositol lipid signaling and {{of a wide range of}} cellular functions, such as proliferation and differentiation (1, 2, 3). PLCb 1 signaling depends on the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate and the formation of the second messengers diacylglycerol and Inositol tris-phosphate which activate canonical protein kinase C (cPKC) isoforms. Here we describe a proteomic approach to find out a potential effector of nuclear PLC-b 1 dependent signaling during insulin stimulated myogenic differentiation. Methods Nuclear lysates obtained from insulin induced C 2 C 12 myoblasts were immunoprecipitated with anti-phospho-substrate cPKC antibody. Proteins, stained with Comassie blue, were excised, digested and subsequently analysed in LC-MS/MS. For peptide sequence searching, the mass spectra were processed and analyzed using the Mascot MS/MS ion search program with the NCBI database. Western blotting, GST-pull down and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to study the interaction between eEF 1 A 2 and cPKCs. <b>Site</b> <b>direct</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> was performed to confirm the phosphorylated motif recognized by the antibody. Immunofluorescence analysis, GFP-tagged eEF 1 A 2 vector and subcellular fractionation were performed to study nuclear localization and relative distribution of eEF 1 A 2. Results We have previously shown that PLC-β 1 is greatly increased at the nuclear level during insulin-induced myoblasts differentiation and that this nuclear localization is essential for induction of differentiation. Thus, nuclear proteins of insulin stimulated C 2 C 12 myoblasts, were immunoprecipitated with an anti-phospho-substrate cPKC antibody. After Electrophoretic gel separation of proteins immunoprecipitated, several molecules were identified by LC-MS/MS. Among these most relevant and unexpected was eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha 2 (eEF 1 A 2). We found that eEF 1 A 2 is phosphorylated by PKCb 1 and that these two molecules coimmunolocalized at the nucleolar level. eEF 1 A 2 could be phosphorylated in many sites among which both threonine and serine residues. By <b>site</b> <b>direct</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> we demonstrated that it is the serine residue of the motif recognized by the antibody that is specifically phosphorylated by PKCb 1. The silencing of PLCb 1 gives rise to a reduction of expression and phosphorylation levels of eEF 1 A 2 indicating this molecule as a target of nuclear PLCb 1 regulatory network during myoblasts differentiation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDownregulation of {{multiple}} cell cycle-regulatory molecules is a dominant event in TGF-β 1 -mediated growth inhibition of human carcinoma cells. It {{is known that}} KLF 10 mimics the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects that TGF-β 1 has on epithelial cell growth {{and the growth of}} various tumor cells; based on these findings it is considered as a tumor suppressor. KLF 10 protein expression is tightly associated with cell cycle-dependent events. However, the regulatory mechanism and its biological meaning have not been identified. In this study, we have demonstrated that KLF 10 is a substrate of CDK 2 /cyclin E and can be phosphorylated. We also have shown that KLF 10 efficiently binds to CDK 2, while binding much less to CDK 4, and displaying no binding to Cdk 6. Using mass spectrometry, <b>site</b> <b>direct</b> <b>mutagenesis,</b> in vitro kinase assays and depletion assays, we have established that CDK 2 phosphorylates Ser 206, which subsequently affects the steady state level of KLF 10 in cells. Our studies have also proved that CDK 2 up-regulates the protein level of KLF 10 through reducing its association with SIAH 1, a KLF 10 E 3 -ubiqutin ligase involved in proteasomal degradation. Taken all together, these findings indicate that CDK 2 -dependent phosphorylation regulates KLF 10 stability and that this affects the role of KLF 10 in cell...|$|R

50|$|Site-directed {{mutagenesis}} can {{be useful}} for many different reasons. A single base pair replacement, could change a codon, and thus replace an amino acid in a protein. This is useful for studying the way certain proteins behave. It is also useful because enzymes can be purposefully manipulated by changing certain amino acids. If an amino acid is changed that is {{in close proximity to}} the active site, the kinetic parameters may change drastically, or the enzyme might behave in a different way. Another application of <b>site</b> <b>directed</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> is exchanging an amino acid residue far from the active site with a lysine residue or cysteine residue. These amino acids make it easier to covalently bond the enzyme to a solid surface, which allows for enzyme re-use and use of enzymes in continuous processes. Sometimes, amino acids with non-natural functional groups (such as ketones and azides) are added to proteins These additions may be for ease of bioconjugation, or to study the effects of amino acid changes on the form and function of the proteins.

Interestingly it has been found that NCX 3 mRNA and protein are both reduced after stroke. However, the mechanism by which stroke-induced ncx 3 gene reduction is still unclear. Notably, in the last decades it has been found that histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibition by regulating specific neuroprotective genes ameliorates the neurodegeneration that occurs in brain ischemia. Interestingly, we found that neurons treated with Trichostatin A (TSA), a pan HDACs inhibitor (HDACi), and MC 1568, a class II HDACs inhibitor, significantly increased ncx 3 promoter activity, whereas MS- 275 (class I HDACs inhibitor) had no significant effect. Notably, among the HDACs class II A, we found that when the HDAC 4 and HDAC 5 isoforms were overexpressed by construct transfection or knocked-down by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection, NCX 3 mRNA and protein levels were downregulated or increased, respectively. Moreover, experiments of <b>site</b> <b>direct</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> of DREAM (downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator) consensus sequence on ncx 3 promoter in MC 1568 treated neurons, corroborated that NCX 3 downregulation induced by HDACs is achieved by DREAM. Notably, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated that HDAC 4 and HDAC 5 binding on ncx 3 promoter was significantly increased after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Our findings identify a new epigenetic regulatory mechanism that controls NCX 3 gene transcription and demonstrated that HDAC class II A inhibition, by blocking HDAC 4 and HDAC 5 and modulating the acetylation of ncx 3 gene promoter sequence, could be a new therapeutic strategy in stroke treatment...|$|R
40|$|STAT 3 is {{a latent}} {{transcription}} factor that promotes cell survival and proliferation {{and is often}} constitutively active in cancers. Although many reports provide evidence that STAT 3 is a direct target of oxidative stress, its redox regulation is poorly understood. Under oxidative conditions STAT 3 activity can be modulated by S-glutathionylation, a reversible redox modification of cysteine residues. This suggests the possible cross-talk between phosphorylation and glutathionylation and points out that STAT 3 is susceptible to redox regulation. Recently, we reported that decreasing the GSH content in different cell lines induces inhibition of STAT 3 activity through the reversible oxidation of thiol groups. In the present work, we demonstrate that GSH/diamide treatment induces S-glutathionylation of STAT 3 in the recombinant purified form. This effect was completely reversed by treatment with the reducing agent dithiothreitol, indicating that S-glutathionylation of STAT 3 was related to formation of protein-mixed disulfides. Moreover, addition of the bulky negatively charged GSH moiety impairs JAK 2 -mediated STAT 3 phosphorylation, very likely interfering with tyrosine accessibility and thus affecting protein structure and function. Mass mapping analysis identifies two glutathionylated cysteine residues, Cys 328 and Cys 542, within the DNA-binding domain and the linker domain, respectively. <b>Site</b> <b>direct</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> and in vitro kinase assay confirm the importance of both cysteine residues in the complex redox regulatory mechanism of STAT 3.

40|$|AbstractKLF 10 is now {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the Krüppel-like transcription factor family and acts as a tumor suppressor. Although KLF 10 is originally named as TGF-β-inducible early gene- 1 and mimicking the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β in various carcinoma cells, the transcriptional upregulatory function of KLF 10 has been described for a variety of cytokines and in many diseases. Through in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation assays, we identified that KLF 10 is a phosphorylated protein in cells. Using yeast-two hybrid screening and <b>site</b> <b>direct</b> <b>mutagenesis,</b> we also identified PIN 1 as a novel KLF 10 associated protein. PIN 1 is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase enzyme belonging to the parvulin family, which specifically recognizes phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro containing substrates. Through protein–protein interaction assays, we showed that the Pro-directed Ser/Thr-Pro motif at Thr- 93 in the KLF 10 N-terminal region is essential for the interaction between KLF 10 and PIN 1. More importantly, PIN 1 interacts with KLF 10 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and this interaction promotes KLF 10 protein degradation in cells. Therefore, KLF 10 shows shorter protein stability compared with mutant KLF 10 that lacks PIN 1 binding ability after cycloheximide treatments. The reversely correlated expression profile between KLF 10 and PIN 1 as observed in cell lines was also shown in clinic pancreatic cancer specimen. Using in vitro kinase assays and depletion assays, we were able to show that RAF- 1 phosphorylates the Thr- 93 of KLF 10 and affects the KLF 10 expression level in cells. Thus these findings as a whole indicate that RAF- 1 phosphorylation and PIN 1 isomerization together regulate KLF 10 stability and further affect the role of KLF 10 in tumor progression...|$|R

Systematic mutagenesis study on Lys 209 of amylase AMY 121 revealed that all of the nineteen substitution mutants on the 209 th site led to stability loss compared with wild type enzyme, indicating the crucial role of residue Lys 209 in protein structural stabilizing.

50|$|<b>Site</b> <b>directed</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> is a {{valuable}} technique that allows for the replacement of a single base in an oligonucleotide or gene.

The same technique can be used to create a gene insertion or deletion.

The Kunkel's method, {{on account of}} its cost effectiveness and simplicity, is preferred by many a scientist. However, a general drawback of this method is the high background due to persistence of the parent template resulting in low efficiency of mutagenesis. In this report, we describe a modification of the Kunkel's method {{to increase the efficiency}} of selecting against the wild type strand: We have used Sequenase for the extension reaction, and introduced an in vitro UDG step to enhance the biological selection against the parent strand. Consequently, the efficiency of the modified method is enhanced to allow screening of the mutants directly by DNA sequencing. A step by step single tube protocol which is over in less than three hours makes it a method of choice for efficient and cost-effective <b>site</b> <b>directed</b> <b>mutagenesis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Sequence {{analysis}} of Candida rugosa lipase 1 (LIP 1) predicts {{the presence of}} three N-linked glycosylation sites at asparagine 291, 314, 351. To investigate the relevance of sugar chains in the activation and stabilization of LIP 1, we <b>directed</b> <b>site</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> to replace the above mentioned asparagine with glutamine residues. Comparison of the activity of mutants {{with that of the}} wild-type (wt) lipase indicates that both 314 and 351 Asn to Gln substitutions influence, although at a different extent, the enzyme activity both in hydrolysis and esterification reactions, but they do not alter the enzyme water activity profiles in organic solvents or temperature stability. Introduction of Gln to replace Asn 351 is likely to disrupt a stabilizing interaction between the sugar chain and residues of the inner side of the lid in the enzyme active conformation. The effect of deglycosylation at position 314 is more difficult to explain and might suggest a more general role of the sugar moiety for the structural stability of lipase 1. Conversely, Asn 291 Gln substitution does not affect the lipolytic or the esterase activity of the mutant that behaves essentially as the wt enzyme. This observation supports the hypothesis that changes in activity of Asn 314 Gln and Asn 351 Gln mutants are specifically due to deglycosylation...|$|R
