25|$|The reactor is {{equipped}} with a fuel rod leak detector. A <b>scintillation</b> <b>counter</b> detector, sensitive to energies of short-lived fission products, is mounted on a special dolly and moved over the outlets of the fuel channels, issuing an alert if increased radioactivity is detected in the steam-water flow.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{airborne}} detectors to prospect for radioactive minerals was first proposed by G.C. Ridland, a geophysicist working at Port Radium in 1943. In 1947, the earliest recorded trial {{of airborne}} radiation detectors (ionization chambers and Geiger counters) {{was conducted by}} Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited. (a Canadian Crown Corporation since sold to become Cameco Corporation). The first patent for a portable gamma-ray spectrometer was filed by Professors Pringle, Roulston & Brownell of the University of Manitoba in 1949, {{the same year as}} they tested the first portable <b>scintillation</b> <b>counter</b> on the ground and in the air in northern Saskatchewan.|$|E
50|$|Several {{products}} {{have been introduced}} in the market utilising <b>scintillation</b> <b>counters</b> for detection of potentially dangerous gamma-emitting materials during transport. These include <b>scintillation</b> <b>counters</b> designed for freight terminals, border security, ports, weigh bridge applications, scrap metal yards and contamination monitoring of nuclear waste. There are variants of <b>scintillation</b> <b>counters</b> mounted on pick-up trucks and helicopters for rapid response {{in case of a}} security situation due to dirty bombs or radioactive waste. Hand-held units are also commonly used.|$|R

25|$|Scintillation {{counters}} {{consist of}} a scintillating crystal (typically of sodium iodide doped with thallium) attached to a photomultiplier. The crystal produces a group of scintillations for each photon absorbed, the number being proportional to the photon energy. This translates into a pulse from the photomultiplier of voltage proportional to the photon energy. The crystal must be protected with a relatively thick aluminium/beryllium foil window, which limits {{the use of the}} detector to wavelengths below 0.25nm. Scintillation counters are often connected in series with a gas flow proportional counter: the latter is provided with an outlet window opposite the inlet, to which the <b>scintillation</b> <b>counter</b> is attached. This arrangement is particularly used in sequential spectrometers.|$|E
25|$|Balloon flights {{can carry}} {{instruments}} to altitudes {{of up to}} 40km above sea level, where they are above as much as 99.997% of the Earth's atmosphere. Unlike a rocket where data are collected during a brief few minutes, balloons are able to stay aloft for much longer. However, even at such altitudes, much of the X-ray spectrum is still absorbed. X-rays with energies less than 35 keV (5,600 aJ) cannot reach balloons. On July 21, 1964, the Crab Nebula supernova remnant was discovered to be a hard X-ray (15 – 60 keV) source by a <b>scintillation</b> <b>counter</b> flown on a balloon launched from Palestine, Texas, USA. This was likely the first balloon-based detection of X-rays from a discrete cosmic X-ray source.|$|E
500|$|For {{both the}} gas {{proportional}} counter and liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>counter,</b> what is measured {{is the number}} of beta particles detected in a given time period. Since the mass of the sample is known, this can be converted to a standard measure of activity in units of either counts per minute per gram of carbon (cpm/g C), or becquerels per kg (Bq/kg C, in SI units). Each measuring device is also used to measure the activity of a blank sample– a sample prepared from carbon old enough to have no activity. This provides a value for the background radiation, which must be subtracted from the measured activity of the sample being dated to get the activity attributable solely to that sample's [...] In addition, a sample with a standard activity is measured, to provide a baseline for comparison.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the decade}} from 1950 to 1960, Ney's cosmic ray {{research}} {{shifted away from}} cloud chambers toward emulsions. [...] However, his graduate students used counter controlled cloud chambers to make significant advances in electronic instrumentation for the detection and analysis of cosmic rays. [...] Specifically, in 1954, John Linsley used a cloud chamber triggered by a cherenkov detector to study the charge distribution of heavy nuclei, and in 1955, Frank McDonald used one triggered by a <b>scintillation</b> <b>counter</b> for a similar purpose. [...] Later, McDonald combined these two electronic detectors into a balloon instrument {{that served as a}} prototype for devices carried on many spacecraft.|$|E
2500|$|Under Principal Samuel Curran, internationally {{respected}} nuclear physicist (and {{inventor of}} the <b>scintillation</b> <b>counter),</b> the Royal College gained University Status, receiving its Royal Charter to become The University of Strathclyde in 1964, merging with the Scottish College of Commerce at the same time. [...] Contrary to popular belief, The University of Strathclyde was not created {{as a result of}} the Robbins Report – the decision to grant the Royal College university status had been made earlier in the 1960s but delayed as a result of Robbins Report. [...] The University of Strathclyde was the UK's first technological university reflecting its history, teaching and research excellence in technological education. [...] In 1993, the University incorporated Jordanhill College of Education.|$|E
2500|$|The {{voltage pulse}} {{produced}} by the detector (or by the photomultiplier in a <b>scintillation</b> <b>counter)</b> is shaped by a multichannel analyzer (MCA). The multichannel analyzer takes the very small voltage signal {{produced by the}} detector, reshapes it into a Gaussian or trapezoidal shape, and converts that signal into a digital signal. In some systems, the analog-to-digital conversion is performed before the peak is reshaped. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) also sorts the pulses by their height. ADCs have specific numbers of [...] "bins" [...] into which the pulses can be sorted; these bins represent the channels in the spectrum. The number of channels can be changed in most modern gamma spectroscopy systems by modifying software or hardware settings. The number of channels is typically a power of two; common values include 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, or 16384 channels. The choice of number of channels depends on {{the resolution of the}} system and the energy range being studied.|$|E

2500|$|Sets {{of surface}} {{measurements}} are important data to meteorologists. They give {{a snapshot of}} a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a weather station, a ship or a weather buoy. The measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables. Usually, temperature, pressure, wind measurements, and humidity are the variables that are measured by a thermometer, barometer, anemometer, and hygrometer, respectively. Professional stations may also include air quality sensors (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, dust, and smoke), ceilometer (cloud ceiling), falling precipitation sensor, [...] flood sensor, lightning sensor, microphone (explosions, sonic booms, thunder), pyranometer/pyrheliometer/spectroradiometer (IR/Vis/UV photodiodes), rain gauge/snow gauge, <b>scintillation</b> <b>counter</b> (background radiation, fallout, radon), seismometer (earthquakes and tremors), transmissometer (visibility), and a GPS clock for data logging. Upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting. The most widely used technique is launches of radiosondes. Supplementing the radiosondes a network of aircraft collection is organized by the World Meteorological Organization.|$|E

One of the essential elements of this upgrade is the upgrade of the Muon detector system. The Muon detector system consists of the Central Muon Detector and the Forward Muon Detector. The Central Muon Detector consists of three detector systems: the Proportional Drift Tube (PDT) chambers which were used in Run I, the B- and C-layer <b>Scintillation</b> <b>Counters,</b> and new the A-layer <b>Scintillation</b> <b>Counters.</b> The Forward Muon Detector consists of the Mini-Drift Tubes (MDTs) and the <b>Scintillation</b> Pixel <b>Counters.</b> There are three layers, designated A, B, C, of the Muon detector system. The A-layer is closest to the interaction region and a toroid magnet is located between the A- and B-layers.
