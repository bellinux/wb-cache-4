ICT spread human intellectual possibilities and with that they contributed a lot in developing of our civilization but there are some questions: is it <b>our</b> <b>life</b> in this Information Age better, nicer and easier? Are we more <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> work and <b>life?</b> Are we safer thanks to the usage of ICT?

Themes of the software and hardware programming were “game” and “robot”, respectively. We adopted a beginner’s programming environment Scratch as a common education support tool of software and hardware. Furthermore, educational robot mbot, programmable by the Scratch, is employed for the hardware programming. First, students enjoyed programming their games with the Scratch. Then, they studied how to program the robot easily with the same environment.

If we sadly lose a job in the current climate, then pragmatic considerations of security and income can vie with thoughts of a really different future. If we have a background in research then we have many advantages as we consider other options. This case study demonstrates how desk research and on the spot, face to face exploration were combined in one instance to reach a clear decision about the future. It demonstrates how many angles need to be considered before setting up your own business – or not...|$|R

40|$|In our thesis {{we focused}} on {{developing}} a solution {{that allows us to}} browse actual financial information on the internet easily. We have developed a web portal, which gathers financial information from the social network Twitter. We have also implemented algorithms for searching and filtering the news, and for ranking those messages. The ranking system helps us to distinguish between news that include useful information and those who do not. Besides those two main functionalities our portal also has mechanics for commenting existing messages, posting new messages and follow interesting posters or stocks. We tested the usefulness of our system at the problem of monthly foreign exchange trading. We were <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> results. The portal proved as a good and useful solution to the aforementioned problems...|$|R
