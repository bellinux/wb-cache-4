40|$|BACKGROUND: Scanning laser {{polarimetry}} is a {{tool for}} measuring the retinal nerve fiber layer: both its cross-sectional surface (polarimetric data analysis) and its thickness (mean sector values). METHODS: Two observers examined 56 normal volunteers twice by means of scanning laser polarimetry (Nerve Fiber Analyzer type 1, software version 1. 6). Measurements of the retinal nerve fiber layer were carried out in four equal <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> around the optic nerve head. The measured values <b>of</b> the <b>sectors</b> and the calculated ratios among them were used for statistical analysis. Interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility were analyzed following a balanced random three-way cross classification with interactions. Interobserver reproducibility {{was defined as the}} part of variance not influenced by the observers. Intraobserver reproducibility was defined as the part of variance not influenced by the time. RESULTS: For repeated measurements of the retinal nerve fiber layer, better intraobserver than interobserver reproducibility was found (0. 57 - 0. 79 vs 0. 11 - 0. 44). The interobserver reproducibility was improved (0. 24 - 0. 65) in comparison to the intraobserver reproducibility (0. 32 - 0. 68) by calculating the ratios of the measured values. CONCLUSION: The instrument is clinically useful only if used by the same observer. If measurements are performed by different observers the ratios of the measurements must be used. Further development in the apparatus is needed to improve interobserver reproducibility...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBacteriorhodopsin (BR) and {{specific}} lipid molecules self-assemble into a quasi two-dimensional lattice structure {{known as the}} purple membrane (PM). In the PM, BR molecules exist in a trimeric form with lipid molecules present in the space enclosed by each trimeric unit and in the inter-trimer space. These trimeric units, which have a roughly circular cross-section, are arranged in hexagonal patterns with long-ranged crystalline order. In this work, we investigate the self-assembly of BR in the PM via Monte Carlo simulations <b>of</b> <b>a</b> two-dimensional model <b>of</b> the membrane and proteins. The protein molecules are modeled as 120 ° <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> and the lipid molecules enter into the model through effective protein-protein interactions. The sectors cannot overlap with each other, {{and in addition to}} this excluded volume interaction there are site-site attractive interactions between specific points of the proteins to mimic interactions between helices on the proteins and lipid-induced interactions. At low values of the attractive well depth, the proteins are found in the monomeric form at all concentrations. At moderate and high values of the attractive well depth, trimers are formed as the concentration increases, and with a further increase in concentration the trimers organize into a hexagonal lattice. The interactions between the proteins and those induced by the intra-trimer lipids play an equally important role in the formation of trimers and the lattice. The lipids in the inter-trimer space cause the trimers to orient in a specific direction in the hexagonal crystal lattice...|$|R
40|$|The {{article by}} Wing et al. (1) {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} calculating the relative intensity of radioactive fallout between <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> drawn around the accident at Three Mile Island. The partition derived from wind and weather data allowed <b>a</b> comparison <b>of</b> ratios of radiation exposure between sectors with cancer incidence ratios and bypassed much of the uncertainty involved in calculating actual doses. The results indicated that higher fallout was correlated with higher cancer incidence. Considering that the average levels of radioactivity in each sector were low, this {{could be interpreted as}} evidence for a proportional carcinogenic response to low doses of ionizing radiation. There is, however, a simpler way to interpret the same set of data. Wing et al. (1) reported that some of the people exposed to the fallout from the accident showed signs of acute radiation damage. They also reported that ground measurements of radioactivity were not adequate to show the details of distribution of the fallout or the resulting doses to individuals. We are free to infer that the fallout was patchy, that some of the residents were exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation, and that the data of Wing et al. (1) show <b>a</b> correlation <b>of</b> the frequency of high exposure "hits " on people in each sector with the <b>sector's</b> share <b>of</b> the region's radioactive burden. In this view, increases in cancer incidence were simply correlated with the number of people hit by high doses of ionizing radiation. This interpretation is consistent with the conclusions drawn by Raabe et al. (2) from data on radium dial painters, the data set that offers the most precise readings of both individual radiation doses and carcinogenic effects in humans. It is also consistent with the patchy distribution of radioactive fallout from explosions often observed at th...|$|R

50|$|Radial stubs are a planar {{component}} {{that consists of}} a <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> rather than a constant-width line. They are used with planar transmission lines when a low impedance stub is required. Low characteristic impedance lines require a wide line.

50|$|In 1667, Gregory issued his Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura, {{in which}} he showed how {{the areas of the}} circle and {{hyperbola}} could be obtained in the form of infinite convergent series. This work contains a remarkable geometrical proposition to the effect that the ratio of the area of any arbitrary <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> to that of the inscribed or circumscribed regular polygons is not expressible by a finite number of terms. Hence he inferred that the quadrature of the circle was impossible; this was accepted by Montucla, but it is not conclusive, for it is conceivable that some particular sector might be squared, and this particular sector might be the whole circle. Nevertheless Gregory was effectively among the first to speculate about the existence of what are now termed transcendental numbers. In addition the first proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus and the discovery of the Taylor series can both be attributed to him.|$|E

30|$|The {{premise of}} feature point {{description}} {{is the main}} direction calibration of feature points. Make <b>a</b> circular neighborhood <b>of</b> <b>a</b> certain size centered on the feature point and use the Haar wavelet template to process the image in the neighborhood to make the Haar wavelet response in each direction of x and y. Then, use <b>a</b> <b>sector</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> certain size to make <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> around the selected feature point, calculate {{the sum of the}} Haar wavelet response vectors for all points on the image when the sector is at any angle, and find the largest value of the Haar wavelet response vector. The one that corresponds to this direction is the main direction of the feature point. After defining the main direction, you can build the description vector in the main direction. Centering on the selected feature point, a square neighborhood with a certain length and a side length is used, and the main direction of the determined feature point is set as the direction of the y-axis of the neighborhood of the square. Divide the square neighborhood into multiple sub-regions, use dx and dy to represent the Haar wavelet response in the x and y directions in each sub-region, and sum the dx, dy, |dx||dy| in each sub-region. Get a four-dimensional vector V(∑dx,[*]∑dy,[*][*]∑[*]|[*]dx|[*],[*][*]∑[*]|[*]dy|[*]).
