Its establishment was seen as putting a limit on possible dictatorial measures in legislation, which is especially important in a one-party dominated Parliament like Singapore's.

2500|$|Dacre became {{chairman}} of the PCC's Editors' Code of Practice Committee in April 2008. On 9 November 2008, Dacre gave {{a speech to the}} Society of Editors in which he was critical of the emerging pressures for privacy laws following the conclusion of the Max Mosley libel case against the News of the World and Mr Justice Eady's closing remarks. According to Dacre, Eady had [...] "effectively ruled that it was perfectly acceptable for" [...] Mosley [...] "to pay five women £2,500 to take part in acts of unimaginable sexual depravity with him" [...] which is [...] "the very abrogation of civilised behaviour of which the law {{is supposed to be the}} safeguard". <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> want [...] "to force a privacy law", the bill would need to go through the parliamentary stages, [...] "withstand public scrutiny and win a series of votes", Dacre said. [...] "Now, thanks to the wretched Human Rights Act, one judge with a subjective and highly relativist moral sense can do the same with a stroke of his pen". Referring to a case in 2006 where Eady had blocked the publication of a married man's account of his wife's seduction by a prominent figure involved in sport, Dacre said [...] "the judge - in an unashamed reversal of centuries of moral and social thinking - placed the rights of the adulterer above society’s age-old belief that adultery should be condemned". If newspapers, which [...] "devote considerable space" [...] to [...] "public affairs, don't have the freedom to write about scandal, I doubt whether they will retain their mass circulations with the obvious worrying implications for the democratic process".|$|E

6000|$|I will {{allude to}} a charge made against {{one member of}} the cabinet, because the {{circumstances}} of the case were all acknowledged and proved. This gentleman employed his wife's brother-in-law to buy ships, and the agent so employed pocketed about 20,000l. by the transaction in six months. The excuse made was that this profit was in accordance with the usual practice of the ship-dealing trade, and that it was paid by the owners who sold, and not by the government which bought. But in so vast an agency the ordinary rate of profit on such business became an enormous sum; and the gentleman who made the plea must surely have understood that that 20,000l. was in fact paid by the government. It is the purchaser, and not the seller, who in fact pays all such fees. The question is this: <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> have paid so vast a sum for one man's work for six months? And if so, was it well that that sum should go into the pocket of a near relative of the minister whose special business it was to protect the government? ...|$|E

60|$|This {{battle is}} also memorable {{as being the}} {{occasion}} of the first public appearance of Mr. John Dunn, now the most important chief in Zululand, and, be it understood, the unknown quantity in all future transactions in that country. At that time Dunn was a retainer of Umbelazi's, and fought on his side in the Tugela battle. After the fight, however, he went over to Cetywayo and became his man. From that time till the outbreak of the Zulu war he remained in Zululand as adviser to Cetywayo, agent for the Natal Government, and purveyor of firearms to the nation at large. As soon as Cetywayo got into trouble with the Imperial Government, Dunn, like a prudent man, deserted him and came over to us. In reward Sir Garnet Wolseley advanced him to the most important chieftainship in Zululand, which he hopes to make a stepping-stone to the vacant throne. His advice was largely followed by Sir Garnet in the bestowal of the other chieftainships, and was naturally not quite disinterested. He has already publicly announced his intention of resisting the return of the king, his old master, by force of arms, <b>should</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> attempt to reinstate him.|$|E
