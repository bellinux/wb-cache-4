5|$|In a {{retrospective}} Virtual Console review, IGN's Lucas M. Thomas commended the gameplay depth and the detailed visual presentation. He acknowledged the difficulty, even on easy, but praised {{the game as}} one of the best examples of the niche <b>shooting</b> <b>gallery</b> genre. Mat Allen of Nintendo Life found the game to be an excellent example of what the Virtual Console is for: providing gamers chances to experience quality games that were overlooked in their time. He highlighted the release as providing a cheap option to play a game which has become an expensive collector's item.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 28 games {{distributed}} on 11 different game cards were released for the Magnavox Odyssey. 13 games were {{included with the}} console—a set of 12 in America and {{a different set of}} 10 in other countries—with 6 others available for purchase either individually for US$5.49 or in a pack for US$24.99; the additional games primarily used the same game cards with different screen overlays and instructions. Another game, Percepts, was available for free to players that sent in a survey card. A light gun accessory, <b>Shooting</b> <b>Gallery,</b> was available for purchase, and included four games on two cards that used the rifle. A final four games were released for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Don Emry. The games do not enforce game rules or keep track of score; that is left up to the players.|$|E
5|$|Many {{visitors}} {{arriving on}} the steamers {{never left the}} pier and Birnbeck Island which between them housed the cafe, pavilion, amusements and funfair. These were destroyed by fire on 26 December 1897 and replaced by the present buildings, although these have been altered over the years. The attractions included Mutoscopes, a <b>shooting</b> <b>gallery,</b> merry-go-round, park swings, a theatre of wonders and a licensed bar. In 1891 a telephone was installed only {{six months after the}} first one was installed in the town. In 1909, the amusement area was expanded by an extension on iron supports along {{the south side of the}} island. However, this was not built to the proper specifications so was demolished in 1912; a larger concrete platform was added in its place in 1932.|$|E

5|$|Wild Guns is a <b>shooting</b> <b>gallery</b> {{game with}} an American Wild West setting along with sci-fi and steampunk influences. The {{gameplay}} combines elements from third-person shooters and light gun {{games in a}} similar fashion to Blood Bros. and Cabal. There are six levels, each with two stages, followed by a mini-boss, and a third stage with a final boss. Single player and cooperative modes are available, as well as target practice allowing two players to compete to achieve the highest score. The story follows a young woman named Annie seeking revenge against the Kid family for abducting and killing her family. She seeks help from renowned space bounty hunter Clint. Although Clint says he doesn't need Annie's assistance, she insists, claiming she has a personal vendetta against the Kid family and is a skilled shooter.|$|E
5|$|The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) in NOLF was significantly advanced {{at the time}} of the game's release. Enemy AI can react to eleven different stimuli, including hearing the player's footsteps or weapon firing, seeing the player's footprints in the snow, or hearing an ally scream in pain. The AI can try and investigate the source of these stimuli, by following the footprints for example, and can sound alarms or call for backup. During combat, the AI finds cover positions, and, to some extent, can also use its environment for protection, such as flipping over a table and hiding behind it. After advancing AI technology in their subsequent games, Monolith likened the way NOLFs AIs pop randomly in and out of cover to a <b>shooting</b> <b>gallery.</b> Groups of AI guards make use of a group logic when investigating and combating the player. For example, one guard might start firing at the player, while another runs and calls for backup. The game's AI includes friendly and enemy humans, as well as dogs, sharks, and helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} the machine, and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, <b>Shooting</b> <b>Gallery,</b> and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|E

25|$|Sin and Punishment is a rail shooter and <b>shooting</b> <b>gallery</b> {{video game}} co-developed by Treasure and Nintendo.

Scientists develop a new species to raise as food, but the creatures revolt and war breaks out. The player takes on the roles of Saki and Airan as they fight to save Earth from destruction. The game employs a unique Nintendo 64 controller layout, utilizing both the D-pad and control stick. This control scheme allows the player to strafe, jump, and dodge around the screen while simultaneously aiming the targeting reticle. The player must shoot at enemies and projectiles while also dodging attacks to survive and progress through the game.|$|E

25|$|Sin and Punishment is an arcade-style rail shooter and <b>shooting</b> <b>gallery</b> video game. The player {{character}} is controlled from a behind-the-back perspective, and can strafe left and right, double-jump, and perform a roll dodge. The character progresses forward through the level automatically {{due to the}} rail shooter format which drew comparisons from critics to the Panzer Dragoon series, Star Fox series, and Space Harrier. A targeting reticle is used to aim shots on enemies and projectiles and has two modes that the player can freely alternate between, a lock-on mode and a free aiming mode. The lock-on mode will auto-lock onto visible targets, and the player can quickly move the reticle between targets. Alternatively, the free aiming mode gives the player full control of the reticle and a more powerful shot. The player {{character is}} also armed with a sword {{which can be used}} to damage or destroy nearby enemies, and redirect projectiles back at the enemies. The character can be controlled by a single player, or cooperatively between two players. In cooperative mode, one player controls the movement while the other is responsible for firing duties.|$|E
25|$|August began explosively for D.C. United, with United {{defeating}} visitors Real Salt Lake {{in a wild}} 6–4 <b>shooting</b> <b>gallery</b> of a game. As {{they did}} the previous weekend at home, United surrendered an extremely early goal, {{this time in the}} second minute. Once again, United also soon gave up another goal, falling behind 2–0 before rallying to victory. Rolfe scored unassisted from about 7 yards before halftime. Chris Rolfe tied the score in the second half, on a penalty kick that set off an incredible spree of goals. Five minutes after Rolfe's penalty kick evened the score, Taylor Kemp put the home team in front with a prodigious one-time strike on a loose ball from about 25 yards. The visitors evened the score only 3 minutes later with a header for goal on a free kick taken by Javier Morales. The tie score lasted about a minute, as Fabian Espindola was credited with a goal as he stretched to try and connect with a loose rebound, following a shot by Alvaro Saborio. RSL defender Justen Glad attempted to clear the loose ball off the line, but his attempted clearance hit Espindola's outstretched leg and the ball crossed the line before the defense could react. Once again, United failed to protect the lead, as RSL's Morales again picked apart the defense and earned his second assist within 6 minutes. This time, the tie score lasted for 11 minutes as Kemp served in a cross after a short corner kick, with Perry Kitchen getting {{on the end of the}} cross, heading it for the game-winning goal, in the 79th minute. Six minutes later, Nick DeLeon knifed through the RSL defense and blasted a long-range shot for an unassisted goal, capping off the 6-4 win. The six goals scored by United were the most the team had scored since a game in 2004, tying the team's all-time record mark. The combined 10 goals were also the most in any MLS game since 2004, a total that had been exceeded only once in league history. The win put D.C. United back on top of the Supporters Shield standings. Several teams held games in hand and the chance to catch United in that race, but only FC Dallas had earned more points per game played.|$|E
