John's political work and ideology had a strong influence on Josephine, as did the religious teaching she received from her mother; the family background and the circles in which she moved formed a strong <b>social</b> <b>conscience</b> and a staunch religious faith.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{grew up in}} a well-to-do and {{politically}} connected progressive family which helped develop in her a strong <b>social</b> <b>conscience</b> and firmly held religious ideals. She married George Butler, an Anglican divine and schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a bannister. The death was a turning point for Josephine, and she focused her feelings on helping others, starting with the inhabitants of a local workhouse. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases—particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy—through the forced medical examination of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Josephine also formed the International Abolitionist Federation, a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent.|$|E

Her father was an Irish {{immigrant}} and officer in the Victorian Garrison Artillery. Jacob, born at Cork, Ireland, on 10 March 1839 of Polish, Jewish and Irish stock, arrived in Victoria in 1858 and settled initially at Portland.

On 3 June 1868 he married Isabella (1849-1916), eldest daughter of Scottish-born squatter Samuel Proudfoot Hawkins. Her mother was a suffragist, a teetotaller and worked for social reform.

40|$|Many early critics found affinities between William Blake and Emily Dickinson {{in their}} radical {{disruption}} of poetic language, their penchant for gnomic utterance, and their cryptic imagery that hinted at a complex private mythology, {{all of which}} contributed to a view of Blake and Dickinson as mystics or poet-prophets with a message accessible only to initiates. Later twentieth-century scholarship, however, turned toward a closer investigation of the cultural milieu in which Dickinson and Blake produced their poetry—in particular, {{their relationship to the}} Protestant hymn tradition exemplified by Isaac Watts. Scholars have examined the ways in which Dickinson and Blake individually appropriated this tradition only to subvert it, but none has undertaken a synoptic examination of works in which both writers perform this subversion. Since {{there is no evidence of}} Dickinson having read Blake, the point of inquiry into the relationship between his writings and hers is to examine the ways in which their common sources—the Protestant hymnodists—inform both their poetics and their <b>social</b> <b>consciences.</b> Setting texts by Blake and Dickinson alongside those of Watts allows for an assessment of congruences and divergences in the ways in which these poems and their authors challenge the theological, educational, and stylistic hegemonies the hymn tradition advanced...|$|R
25|$|Using his <b>social</b> <b>conscience,</b> Brandeis {{became a}} leader of the Progressive movement, and used the law as the {{instrument}} for social change. From 1897 to 1916, he was in the thick of multiple reform crusades. He fought in Boston to secure honest traction franchises and in 1907 launched a six-year fight to prevent banker J. P. Morgan from monopolizing New England's railroads. After an exposé of insurance fraud in 1906, he devised the Massachusetts plan to protect small wage-earners through savings bank life insurance. He supported the conservation movement and in 1910 emerged as the chief figure in the Pinchot-Ballinger investigation.|$|E

A leading advocate of reform for mental illness was Dorothea Dix, a Massachusetts woman who made an intensive study of the conditions that the mentally ill were kept in. Dix's report to the Massachusetts state legislature along with the development of the Kirkbride Plan helped to alleviate the miserable conditions for many of the mentally ill. Although these facilities often fell short of their intended purpose, reformers continued to follow Dix's advocacy and call for increased study and treatment of mental illness.|$|E
25|$|Nagai {{and another}} playwright, Hisashi Inoue, have {{similarities}} in their approaches because they both aim {{to write about}} ordinary people going through extraordinary situations. Both playwrights also write differently compared to other playwrights in their own generation — such as Toshiki Okada and Oriza Hirata. The clear and logical structure of Nagai's plays makes it naturalistic The characters are caught in some predicament and the motor for the play's theatricality is how the characters are liberated from the predicament. Nagai's plays are easily accessible to Western audiences because her works are both traditionally Japanese while also being very universal at the same time. Another playwright, Yōji Sakate, also resembles Nagai because the motivation behind his dramas is his <b>social</b> <b>conscience.</b> Sakate and Nagai both combine elements of Shingeki and Angura.|$|E
40|$|History has {{revealed}} {{that there is a}} never-ending evolution of theories or models of corporate governance. One of the reasons is due to the very essence of <b>social</b> <b>consciences</b> that is minimal and profit making took center stage. All over the world, companies are trying to instill the sense of governance into their corporate structure. With the surge of capitalism, corporation became stronger while governments all over the world had to succumb to its manipulations and dominance. Hence, this article is a review of literature on the range of theories in corporate governance. The fundamental theories in corporate governance began with the agency theory, expanded into stewardship theory and stakeholder theory and evolved to resource dependency theory, transaction cost theory, political theory and ethics related theories such as business ethics theory, virtue ethics theory, feminists ethics theory, discourse theory and postmodernism ethics theory. However, these theories address the cause and effect of variables, such as the configuration of board members, audit committee, independent directors and the role of top management and their social relationships rather than its regulatory frameworks. Hence, it is suggested that a combination of various theories is best to describe an effective and good governance practice rather than theorizing corporate governance based on a single theory...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to Peter Berger’s and Thomas Luckmann’s theory of the {{construction}} of reality in the context of social practices transformation in the risk society. According to this theory, daily routine appears to be the basis of social reality that is interpreted {{as the result of the}} interaction processes. The article considers the fundamental procedures of the social reality construction - institutionalization and legitimization; such an analysis proves the famous sociologists idea that the daily routine is the foundation of social world. However, while analyzing daily routine practices we can see that the habitual behavior patterns are changing and new types of action are developing in the situation of the unstable and unpredictable crisis society. In the contemporary world, the habitual rational logic that we traditionally followed in everyday life to organize our behavior does not fulfill its functions. As a result, a special type of <b>social</b> <b>consciences</b> named catastrophic thinking is developing.

25|$|In the United States two photographers got {{involved}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century in favor of people on the margins of society, Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine. For them the camera was an instrument of accusation against social injustice. In 1890 Riis documented the living conditions of the unemployed and homeless in New York ("How the Other Half Lives"). He was also interested in the fate of immigrants, many of whom lived in extreme poverty in the New York slums. Riis clearly takes sides for the people he photographed and appeals to the <b>social</b> <b>conscience</b> of society. In 1908 the National Child Labor Committee hired Hine, a sociology professor who advocated photography as an educational medium, to document child labor in American industry. In the early 20th century Hine would publish thousands of photographs designed to pull at the nation's heartstrings. Child Labor was widespread in the U.S. in the early 20th century. Hine equally drew attention to the situation of immigrants. The work of Riis and Hine had political influence. Riis' commitment to the people in the Mulberry Bend neighborhood led to its demolition. The building of schools and educational programs can also be attributed to Riis. Hine's work culminated in a law against child labor, the Keating-Owen Act of 1916, which was repealed shortly after the entry of the U.S. into the First World War.|$|E
25|$|Koechlin {{was born}} in Paris, and was the {{youngest}} child of a large family. His mother's family came from Alsace and he identified with that region; his maternal grandfather had been the noted philanthropist and textile manufacturer Jean Dollfus, and Koechlin inherited his strongly developed <b>social</b> <b>conscience.</b> His father {{died when he was}} 14. Though he was early interested in music his family wanted him to become an engineer. He entered the École Polytechnique in 1887 but the following year was diagnosed with tuberculosis and had to spend six months recuperating in Algeria. He had to repeat his first year at the École and graduated with only mediocre grades. After a struggle with his family and private lessons with Charles Lefebvre he entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1890 studying first with Antoine Taudou for harmony. In 1892 he started studying with Massenet for composition, André Gedalge for fugue and counterpoint, and Louis Bourgault-Ducoudray for musical history. His fellow-pupils included George Enescu, Ernest Le Grand, Reynaldo Hahn, Max d'Ollone, Henri Rabaud, and Florent Schmitt. From 1896 he was a pupil of Gabriel Fauré, where his fellow-pupils now included Ravel and Jean Roger-Ducasse. Fauré had a major influence on Koechlin; in fact Koechlin wrote the first Fauré biography (1927), a work which is still of value. In 1898 a grateful Koechlin orchestrated the popular suite from Fauré's Pelléas et Mélisande and in 1900 assisted Fauré in the production of the huge open-air drama Promethée.|$|E
40|$|A {{recurring}} theme at the SALT conference was {{the view that}} students come to law school full of fervor to further social justice and law reform, and leave with no other interest than to practice in prestigious law firms and become rich.

Although I agree that the legal profession as a whole has failed in its responsibilities to society, I do not agree that the cause of that failure {{is to be found in}} legal education. Certainly law school did not have that effect on those of us who attended the conference to voice our dismay over the state of our profession. Somehow we survived the law school experience with <b>social</b> <b>consciences</b> intact; indeed, with the benefit of our rigorous training in lawyering skills, we are now able to deal more effectively with what we believe to be injustices in society.

40|$|Through {{in-depth}} qualitative {{interviews with}} five {{current or former}} members of a midwestern National Organization for Women (NOW) chapter, this thesis explores four related research questions regarding: growth of feminist consciousness; how feminist ideology affects the evolution of social networks, and vice versa; the impact of intersecting social hierarchies; and feminism as a force for bonding and bridging social capital in the local community context. Analytical tools include feminist methodology, the articulation model, an understanding of intersecting social hierarchies, and grounded theory. Participants each explained their gradual identification with feminism differently {{as a result of}} specific life experiences, although common elements, like religious upbringing and family dynamics, emerged. Growing feminist consciousness both supported creation of and caused breaks in social networks. Likewise, prior social networks had a mixed impact on development of feminist consciousness. All five women display strong <b>social</b> <b>consciences,</b> attend to community relationships, and value networks, both formal and informal. At the same time, each woman’s different social position regarding race, class, sexuality, and religion shaped her views about feminism and relationships. These women do think of their social networks as social capital. In fact, these interviews highlight the potentially recursive relationship between feminist consciousness and social capital. At the same time, they reveal the limitations implicit in the economic model of social capital. As perhaps the only qualitative, individual-level examination of social capital in women-dominated activities, this study enriches our theoretical understanding of the concept while elucidating the community contributions of feminists in a mid-sized midwestern city...|$|R

The earth and all systems related to, and contained within it can be regarded as a finite system in which the different components interact and depend on one another. It is through the recognition of this interdependence and the dire situation thereof that a movement towards renewable energy and ultimately survival has been awakened. A movement powered by numerous commissions and associations working tirelessly to decrease environmental impacts and to improve the lives of all people living on the planet Earth. The current research investigates the Green Building Design Movement and how it contributes to a safer and healthier work and global environment. The current research not only investigates the background of the movement and reveals it as a multi facetted approach stemming from the depletion of existing energy sources and <b>social</b> <b>consciences,</b> but also provides insight to the direction which Green Design and future technological advancements are moving From the conclusions contained in this study the reader will gain a better understanding of the technology, processes and development phases used in Green Building design and how these contribute to lower emissions, lower energy consumption and a more responsible habitation of Earth and its finite systems. In conclusion, the author employs a product and alternative energy source discussion, along with a case study to practically illustrate how the knowledge gained can be applied to optimize a building and the systems within it, while reducing energy consumption and the environmental impact of the building...|$|R
