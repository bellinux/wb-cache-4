50|$|Short fiber {{reinforced}} composites {{are used}} increasingly as a structural material {{because they provide}} superior mechanical properties and can be easily produced by the rapid, low-cost injection molding process, by extrusion and with <b>spray-up</b> <b>technique.</b> An important issue for short fiber thermoplastic composites is void formation and growth during production processes. It {{has been shown that}} voids tend to nucleate at fiber ends, and their content depends on processing conditions, fiber concentration, and fiber length. For example, in an injection molding process bubble growth is suppressed by cooling the material under pressure. Density measurements confirm a much lower void content (-1%) in the injection-molded samples in comparison with the extrudates. Another factor playing an important role in void formation is the cooling rate. While the melt is cooled external surface layers solidify first. These layers restrain the contraction of material within the melt. This leads to internal voiding. As a result, slower cooling rates decrease void content in the composite. Finally, {{it is interesting to note}} that in an extruded structure, longer fibers result in higher void contents. This unexpected behaviour is due to the overcoming of other factors like viscosity, extrusion pressure and shear rate, which make the analysis on this phenomenon very complicated.|$|E
