The transient conjugation of Atg8 to the autophagosomal membrane through a ubiquitin-like conjugation <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for autophagy in eukaryotes. Even though there are homologues in animals (see for example GABARAP, GABARAPL1, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B, MAP1LC3B2, and MAP1LC3C), this article mainly focuses on its role in lower eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae.|$|E

5000|$|The {{presence}} of a nervous <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for an animal {{to be able to}} experience nociception or pain. However, other physiological capacities are also required such as opioid sensitivity and central modulation of responses by analgesics. [...] Enkephalin and α-endorphin-like substances have been found in earthworms. Injections of naloxone (an opioid antagonist) inhibit the escape responses of earthworms. This indicates that opioid substances play a role in sensory modulation, similar to that found in many vertebrates.|$|E
50|$|One {{study found}} that, {{relative}} to typically developing children, high-functioning autistic children showed reduced mirror neuron {{activity in the}} brain's inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis) while imitating and observing emotional expressions. EEG evidence revealed that there was significantly greater mu suppression in the sensorimotor cortex of autistic individuals. Activity in this area was inversely related to symptom severity in the social domain, suggesting that a dysfunctional mirror neuron system may underlie social and communication deficits observed in autism, including impaired theory of mind and empathy. The mirror neuron <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for emotional empathy.|$|E

50|$|Volcker was {{appointed}} by President Barack Obama as {{the chair of the}} President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board on February 6, 2009. President Obama created the board to advise the Obama Administration on economic recovery matters. Volcker argued vigorously that since a functioning commercial banking <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> to the stability of the entire financial system, for banks to engage in high-risk speculation created an unacceptable level of systemic risk. He also argued that the vast increase in the use of derivatives, designed to mitigate risk in the system, had produced exactly the opposite effect.|$|E
50|$|Structure and form: Importantly, this is {{not just}} the macro scale {{propagation}} of random micro vibrations from one system to another. The global geometric structure of the <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential.</b> The total energy transferred from the flute to the string matters far less than the patterns it takes in transit. That is, the amplitude of the coupled note is irrelevant, what matters is its frequency. Notes that have a higher or lower frequency than the resonant frequency of the string {{will not be able to}} do morphodynamic work.|$|E
50|$|Having a planar ring <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for {{maximizing the}} overlap between the p orbitals {{which make up}} the {{conjugated}} π system. This explains why being a planar, cyclic molecule is a key characteristic of both aromatic and antiaromatic molecules. However, in reality, {{it is difficult to}} determine whether or not a molecule is completely conjugated simply by looking at its structure: sometimes molecules can distort in order to relieve strain and this distortion has the potential to disrupt the conjugation. Thus, additional efforts must be taken in order to determine whether or not a certain molecule is genuinely antiaromatic.|$|E
