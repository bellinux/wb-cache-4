Within four test runs on different machines nearly all tested packages resistes the young larvae of Plodia interpunctella. The packages with peeltop system of VG Nicolaus were as the only water and pressure tight and insect proof.

40|$|Introduction Nowadays, {{guidelines}} {{for the management of}} HBV infection in Italy, recommend using vaccines but the screening test among non-vaccinated people is useful to detect people that have a clear presence of the virus without symptoms of the disease. Thanks to the screening test, people infected with HBV are administered traditional therapy in order to stop the progression to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These diseases cause the decrease of Qol and cause a high consumption of resources for the health system. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a strategy (test strategy) involving the administration of the screening test to patients at risk and the treatment of the infected according to the protocol therapy. This programme is compared with a strategy (no test strategy) which does not include a screening and treats patients affected by cirrhosis or HCC. Methods We created a Markov model following the natural history of the disease and considering the antigen HBeAg to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the test strategy. The analysis was carried out considering a third-party payer perspective. The time horizon considered was 40 cycles of one year. Patients who resulted positive to the test were administered either interferon treatment; or lamivudine or adefovir or entecavir or tenofovir, consistently with the Italian guidelines. Treatments were administered to patients included in the no-test arm after cirrhosis symptoms or HCC. Results The results of the base case analysis show that patients following the test strategy compared with patients of the no-test approach cost [euro] 17, 179 /QALY. The Monte Carlo simulation based on a probabilistic sensitivity analysis points out that in 95 % of the scenarios assumed, the cost per QALY would be under a hypothetical threshold of [euro] 40, 000 which is the amount that international {{guidelines for}} decision makers are likely to consider sustainable for a health system.

This cross-sectional and descriptive study included eighty-eight patients with the IHIV- 1 pattern, 100 patients in the PCG, and 100 people in a healthy control group (HCG). Neopterin and sCD 14 levels were determined by competitive and sandwich ELISA methods, respectively. Mean neopterin and sCD 14 levels among those with the IHIV- 1 pattern were significantly lower than among the PCG (p < 0. 001 and p = 0. 001, respectively), but they were similiar to those in the HCG (p = 0. 57 and p = 0. 66, respectively. Mean neopterin and sCD 14 levels among the PCG were found to be significantly higher than among those with the IHIV- 1 pattern (p < 0. 001 and p = 0. 001, respectively) and among those in the HCG (p = 0. 001, p < 0. 001, respectively). Neopterin did not have adequate predictive value for identifying those in the PCG (area under the curve [AUC] = 0. 534; 95 % CI, 0. 463 - 0. 605; p = 0. 4256); sCD 14 also had poor predictive value but high specificity (100 %) for identifying those in the PCG (AUC = 0. 627; 95 % CI, 0. 556 - 0. 694; p = 0. 0036). While low levels of these two biomarkers were detected among those with the IHIV- 1 pattern, they were found in high levels among those in the PCG. These two markers obviously cannot be used as a <b>sceening</b> test because they have low sensitivies. Taken together, we suggest that neopterin and sCD 14 may be helpful because they both have high specificity (92 %- 100 %) as indirect non-specific markers for predicting the immune activation status of individuals, whether or not they have true positive HIV- 1...|$|R
40|$|At {{every age}} the acute abdomen is a {{potential}} deathly disease. It is dreaded and associated with a high morbidity and mortality among vlbw imfants too. Except congenital malformations, the most common causes for acute abdomen in vlbw infants are NEC, FIP, meconium disease and volvulus. Other causes are rare. In this single center study we analysed all vlbw infants, born between 1. 1. 1995 and 31. 12. 2004 in the Charité- Universitätsmedizin Berlin, developing an acute abdomen in their first hospitalisation. Newborns with congenital intestinal malformations were excluded. Especially we payed attention in perinatal and perioperative differences among the chidren suffering the various diseases. Moreover we <b>sceened</b> perinatal, pre- or postoperative factors which could hint to the direct postoperativ outcome. We noticed that NEC occurred significant later than the other diseases (median 2 oth day of life). Besides the preoperative inflammtory laboratory parameters leads to the underlying disease: With NEC the preoperative CRP is moderately elevated, while Il- 6 is massively increased. This is an indication for a high acuity of NEC. With FIP it is the opposite - the preoperative CRP is more and the Il- 6 less increased. As expected with meconium disease and volvulus the CRP is in normal range, {{because it is a}} matter of non-inflammatory origin. With NEC the preoperative blood-lactate is often heavily elevated. Few data were available, so we had to refrain from the calculation of significance. During the survey for a postoperative positive outcome, that means no further laparotomy or just a projected re-intervention (normally for stoma closure), we found the following beneficial prognostic facts: 5 -minute APGAR > 5, beginning of the illness on the first day of life or after the second week of like and moderate elevation of Il- 6 < 400 ng/dl. Indications for a negative outcome in terms of one or more relaparotomies or lethal consequence seems to be age of gestation 40. 0 °C. Infants with a complicated growth had significantly more frequent an acidosis with a blood-pH, in the mean of 7. 252. Among the postoperative data the development of a capillary leak syndrome is a significant predictor for a lethal outcome. 70. 6 % of the deceased children had this postoperative complication. The prevention of the acute abdomen is important, because despite the medical progress it is still associated with a high rate of complication. In literature only studies for the prevention of NEC can be found. Presumably NEC develops in an interaction of a dysfunction of intestinal motility, bacterial imbalance in gut lumen and intestinal ischemia.

Animals were continuously monitored {{for the evaluation of}} blood pressure, blood gases, heart rate, and intracranial pressure. Analysis of malondialdehyde (MDA) as an index of lipid peroxidation, ascorbic acid, high-energy phosphates, nicotinic coenzymes, oxypurines, and nucleosides was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on neutralized perchloric acid extract of the whole brain. Data showed that MDA, undetectable in control, sham-operated rats, was already present within 1 minute of trauma (1. 77 nmol/g wet weight; SD = 0. 29) and reached maximal values by 2 hours (72. 26 nmol/l w. w.; SD = 11. 26), showing a progressive slow decrease thereafter. In contrast, ATP, GTP, and nicotinic coenzyme (NAD and NADP) concentrations showed significant reduction only by the second hour postinjury. Maximal decrease of the ATP and GTP concentrations were <b>sceen</b> at 6 hours postinjury, whereas NAD and NADP concentrations showed maximum decline by 15 hours. Values recorded in mechanically ventilated rats did not differ significantly from those obtained in spontaneously breathing animals. These findings, supported by the absence of blood gas and blood pressure changes in the spontaneously breathing rats, strongly support the premise that biochemical changes (primarily lipid peroxidation) are not caused by secondary ischemic-hypoxic phenomena but rather are triggered by these forces acting on the brain at the time of impact. In addition, these results suggest that depression of energy metabolism might be caused by peroxidation of the mitochondrial membrane with a consequent alteration of the main mitochondrial function-that is, the energy supply...|$|E

The first major problem discussed here is that ordinary relative error used for this criterion is not suitable {{because it has a}} bound in the case of under-estimation and no bound in the case of overestimation. We propose use of a new relative error called balanced relative error {{as the basis for the}} criterion and introduce seven evaluation criteria for software estimation models. The second major problem is that the ordinary least-squares method used for calculation of parameter values of a software estimation model is neither consistent with the criteria nor robust enough, which means that the solution is easily distorted by outliers. We propose a new consistent and robust method called the least-squares of inverted balanced relative errors (LIRS) and demonstrates its superiority to the ordinary least-squares method by use of five actual data sets. Through the analysis of these five data sets with LIRS, we show the importance of consistent data collection and development standarization to develop a good software sizing model. We compare goodness of fit between the sizing model based on the number of screens, forms, and files, and the sizing model based on the number of data elements for each of them. Based on this comparison, the validity of the number of data elements as independent variables for a sizing model is examined. Moreover, the validity of increasing the number of independent variables is examined...|$|R
40|$|Methicillin {{resistant}} S. aureus (MRSA) is {{a versatile}} and dangerous humanâ€™s pathogen {{and is a}} common cause of nosocomial and community acquired infections. S. aureus causes several types of infections such as bacteremia, folliculitis, sepsis, mastitis, meningitis and toxic shock syndrome and staphylococcal pneumonia. S. aureus has developed resistance to the antibiotic â€˜methicillinâ€™ and continued spread of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains poses a significant risk to patients and contributes to a substantial financial burden on healthcare resources. HA-MRSA isolates usually belong to six lineages (CC 1, CC 5, CC 8, CC 22, CC 30 and CC 45) out of ten dominant clonal complexes (CCs) or lineages. Various methods have been employed to identify and characterize S. aureus strains. Phenotypic techniques {{have been replaced by}} more robust and accurate molecular techniques. The commonly used molecular techniques are Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), Multilocus variable number of Tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), Restriction modification tests (RM), multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and spa typing. Present work focuses on genotyping of clinical MRSA isolates from three tertiary care hospital located in â€œRawalpindi/Islamabadâ€�, in order to examine the types and phylogenetic relationship of the isolates. In order to gain the understanding of the distribution of MRSA clones in Pakistan, where unregulated antibiotic use is widespread and distributions of MRSA is supposed to be high, an epidemiological relationships between 123 methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, isolated between 2006 and 2008 from three tertiary care hospitals of Rawalpinidi and Islamabad, were examined using MLVA scheme, combined with RM typing, PVL <b>sceening,</b> STAR element analysis, spa typing and MLST to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of the Pakistani MRSA isolates. Six loci (clfA, clfB, sdrC, sdrD, spa and sspa) were used in a multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). A total of 63 MTs/haplotypes were obtained by MLVA. Analysis of restriction modification (RM) genes detected, an RM 3 type, associated with CC 8, in most strains and an RM 1 type, associated with CC 30, in only two strains. On further typing of selected strains by Spa typing and MLST, {{it was found that the}} RM 3 /CC 8 isolates were ST 113 -t 064, ST 113 -t 451 or ST 239, with one of four spa types, whilst the RM 1 /CC 30 isolates were ST 30 -t 021. Analysis of STAR element of these strains for three loci showed their close resemblance; only the strains belonging to CC 30 showed no STAR motif in gapR upstream region, confirming their genetic homology to other CC 30 strains. Furthermore, the ST 30 strains were also found positive for PVL gene. The present genotypic study showed that in Pakistan, the isolates belonging to clonal complex eight (CC 8) are dominant in clinical settings. They belong to ST 239, ST 113 or ST 8. The other clonal complex found was CC 30 with presence of PVL gene and isolates belong to ST 30. The use of MLVA in resource poor laboratories as a rapid and robust method for grouping noscomial MRSA isolates into clusters for identification of localized outbreaks is quite fruitful and MLVA may also provide an understanding of the evolutionary processes as changes in the number of repeats at different loci, may be indicative of which loci are prone to natural selection resulting in higher levels of variation, thus VNTRs serve as evolutionary clock for investigating an outbreaks and transmission events. In this study, we observed more variation in clfA and clfB than in sdrC, sdrD, spa and sspa. We also found that a change in repeat number was not necessarily gradual but may have occurred as a result of large jumps. Some isolates with significant differences in repeat numbers at single locus but being identical numbers in all other loci. Further evidence is provided by the spa typing results, i. e. with a loss of four repeats resulting in a shift from t 987 to t 030 and a two repeat difference changed t 021 to t 275. These large jumps might be due to deletions or insertions mediated by recombination or as result of deletions due to slip-strand impairing during DNA replication. Thus MRSA infections have become a challenge across the globe. The MRSA isolates which were once endemic to Europe and America, Africa has now been reported from Asia and thus suggesting that the MRSA isolates which once was endemic to a certain geographical area are no more confined to those boundaries. More over the pandemic spread of one type of MRSA clone across the globe is the result of antibiotic resistance. Therefore a joint global effort will be effective for the control of MRSA infection. Although this study was carried out on limited number of isolated but it is quite useful to strengthen the MRSA data in Pakistan and to develop the genetic profile of MRSA in Pakistan and then to link it globally. This study also helped to under stand that, although there are only two lineages in these hospitals as in most of other Asian countries but there is a diversity at subspecies level as some of the isolates assumed a specific genetic profile as they evolved locally after they were imported to this regio...|$|R
40|$|Objetivos: avaliar o desempenho da citologia oncÃtica convencional e da captura de hÃbridos II na detecÃÃo de lesÃes cervicais neoplÃsicas e prÃ-neoplÃsicas. Sujeitos e MÃtodos: foram recrutadas aleatoriamente 1685 mulheres, da demanda espontÃnea de postos de saÃde da rede pÃblica, em cinco municÃpios do estado do CearÃ. As pacientes, apÃs assinarem termo de consentimento, responderam a um questionÃrio prÃ-elaborado e, a seguir, foram submetidas Ã coleta de {{material}} para CO, CH II e Ã realizaÃÃo de colposcopia, que, sendo positiva, levou Ã imediata biÃpsia dirigida das Ãreas anormais. Os dados foram digitados no programa Microsoft Excel 2000 e analisados no SPSS-for Windows, versÃo 10. 0. O desempenho da CO e CH II foram calculados atravÃs da sensibilidade, especificidade, dos valores preditivos positivo e negativo e dos respectivos intervalos de confianÃa de 95 %. Considerou-se, para anÃlise, como padrÃo ouro negativo, o resultado da colposcopia negativo ou resultado negativo no exame histopatolÃgico e, como padrÃo ouro positivo, o resultado positivo do histopatolÃgico. Avaliaram-se dois pontos de corte distintos: qualquer achado prÃ-neoplÃsico e neoplÃsico do colo uterino e achados de lesÃes intra-epiteliais de alto grau ou cÃncer. Resultados: 56 mulheres (3, 4 %) apresentaram atipias celulares na CO, sendo a CH II positiva em 315 (19 %). Embora 337 (20, 32 %) mulheres tenham sido positivas em um dos testes, somente 19 (1, 1 %) foram positivas nos dois. Entre as 150 que tiveram colposcopia positiva somente em 53 foram encontradas lesÃes no exame histopatolÃgico, sendo a prevalÃncia estimada de 3, 2 % para qualquer lesÃo e de 0, 4 % para lesÃes de alto grau/cÃncer. Considerando o ponto de corte o achado de qualquer lesÃo prÃ-neoplÃsica ou neoplÃsicas, a sensibilidade encontrada para a CO e a CH II foi de 30, 2 % e de 71, 7 %, respectivamente. A especificidade dos testes mencionados foi de 97, 5 % e de 82, 7 %. O VPP e VPN da CO foram de 28, 6 % e de 97, 7 %, respectivamente. JÃ o VPP e VPN da CH foram 12, 1 % e 98, 9 %. Considerando o ponto de corte lesÃes de alto grau ou cÃncer, temos: sensibilidade e especificidade da CO de 28, 6 % e de 99, 9 %, enquanto os VPP e VPN foram de 54, 8 % e de 99, 7 %, respectivamente. A CH II alcanÃou 100 % de sensibilidade e 81, 3 % de especificidade. Os VPP e VPN ficaram em 2, 2 % e 100 %. ConclusÃo: o teste de detecÃÃo do DNA-HPV pela CH II foi mais sensÃvel, porÃm menos especÃfico que a CO. Quando associado Ã CO, melhora significativamente a detecÃÃo das lesÃes cervicais, principalmente as de alto grau e cÃncer. Para este grupo de lesÃes, a CH II isolada apresentou melhor especificidade sem perda da sensibilidade, mostrando-se um bom teste para o rastreamento primÃrio. Objective: {{to compare}} the usual Pap smear (Papanicolaou) and the Hybrid Capture II tests in detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in women of Ceara State. Subjects and Methods: 1685 women were enrolled from routine practice in five municipalities of the main CearÃ State Health Regions. The whole study was explained to the volunteers, who accepted to participate by signing an informed consent form. The study procedures included filling a questionaire and a cervical sample collection, done by a physician, for cytology and HPV-DNA Hybrid Capture, followed by a complete colposcopic evaluation with directed biopsy if necessary. Data were analyzed in Statistical Package for Social Sciences - SPSS - for Windows 10. 0. The accuracy of both tests â Pap smear and Hybrid Capture II - was evaluated by using the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and the respective 95 % confidence intervals. The negative colposcopic examination or negative histological result were considered gold standard for negative results. Positive histological results were considered gold standard for positive results. Results: 56 women (3, 4 %) had abnormal pap smear. Hybrid Capture tests were positive in 315 women (19 %). Despite 337 (20, 32 %) tests had positive results {{for one of the}} two tests, only 19 (1, 1 %) were positive in both tests. Lesions were detected in 53 women among those 150 considered positive in colposcopic examination. The prevalence for any lesion was estimated in 3, 2 % and for high grade lesions and cancer in 0, 4 %. Using the cut-off point as the finding of any cervical lesion, the sensitivity of pap smear and HC II was 30, 2 % and 71, 7 %, respectively. The specificity for pap smear and HC II was 97, 5 % and 82, 7 %, respectively. The positive and negative predictive value for pap smear was 28, 6 % and 97, 7 %, respectively. The positive and negative predictive value for HC II was 12, 1 % and 98, 9 %, respectively. By using the cut-off value as high grade cervical lesions and cancer, the sensitivity and specificity for pap smear were 28, 6 % and 99, 9 %, respectively, and the positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the same test were 54, 8 % and 99, 7 %. The sensitivity and specificity for HC II were 100 % and 81, 3 %, respectively, as well as 2, 2 % and 100 % for positive and negative predictive value. Conclusions: hybrid Capture II test was more sensitive than pap smear, however Hybrid Capture II test was less specific than pap smear. When both tests were used together for detecting cervical lesions the results improved significantly, mainly high grade lesion and cancer. For this group of lesions, HC II alone, presented better specificity, without loss of the sensitivity, apparently itâs a good test for primary <b>sceening...</b>|$|R
