40|$|Robust and {{efficient}} synchronizers are keys elements to ensure good gear shift in heavy vehicles. In {{order to improve}} existing as well as develop new synchronizers, efficient simulation tools are needed. In this contribution, a mechanical system with 5 degrees of freedom modelling a generic synchronizer consisting of engaging <b>sleeve,</b> synchronizer <b>ring</b> and gearwheel are considered. Due {{to the design of}} the different components and their interactions the synchronizing process is described in terms of different steps or phases; presynchronization, main synchronization, blocker transition and engagement. The four main phases are further divided into sub-phases. To study the whole process in a unified manner, Constrained Lagrangian Formalism (CLF) {{turns out to be a}} suitable method in which the interactions between components (<b>sleeve,</b> synchronizer <b>ring</b> and gearwheel) are described by unilateral or/and bilateral constraints imposed on generalized coordinates of the system during different phases. Using CLF a mathematical model of a generic synchronizer is developed and represented by the system of differential-algebraic equations. Kinematics and kinetics of the generic synchronizer are modelled for each sub-phase. The sleeve is considered as a master and the gearwheel is considered as a slave. The statement of the dynamics problem for a generic synchronizer is given and the numerical algorithm is implemented in Matlab for solving the differential-algebraic equations resulting from CLF. The generic synchronizer computational model is adapted to available experimental setup and validated using obtained measurement data. Sensitivity of the synchronization time is studied varying the cone angle, coefficient of dry friction and sleeve force.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess glucose {{homeostasis}} {{and weight loss}} in morbidly obese patients undergoing Silastic® <b>ring</b> <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomy. METHODS: This was a prospective clinical study. Thirty-three female patients with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 42. 33 ± 1. 50 kg/m² (range: 40 - 45 kg/m²), {{a mean age of}} 36. 7 ± 9. 4 years and a mean waist circumference of 118. 7 ± 5. 98 cm were included in this study. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was observed in 11 patients (33. 3 %), and glucose intolerance was observed in 4 patients (12. 1 %). Mean plasma fasting glucose levels were 109. 77 ± 44. 19 mg/dl (75 - 320) in the preoperative period. All Silastic® <b>ring</b> <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomy procedures were performed by the same surgical team using the same anesthetic technique. The patients were monitored for at least 12 months after surgery. RESULTS: The mean weight of the patients decreased from 107. 69 ± 6. 57 kg to 70. 52 ± 9. 36 kg (p < 0. 001), the mean BMI decreased to 27. 4 ± 2. 42 kg/m² (p < 0. 001), and the mean waist circumference decreased to 89. 87 cm ± 6. 66 (p < 0. 001) in the postoperative period. Excess BMI loss was 86. 5 ± 14. 2 %. Fasting glucose levels were reduced to 80. 94 ± 6. 3 mg/dl (p < 0. 001). Remission of diabetes and glucose intolerance was observed in all patients.

40|$|Abstract. Cast {{iron and}} steel rolls used in the {{continuous}} pickling line must be changed frequently because the continuous acid wash equipment induces wear on the roll surface in a short period. The damage portions are usually repaired by using the flame spray coating. Recently, ceramics materials are planed to be introduced to prevent the damage because of their high abrasion and corrosion resistances. In this study new roll structure is considered where a ceramics sleeve is connected with steel shafts at both ends by shrink fitting. Here, the ceramics sleeve may provide a longer lifetime and reduces the cost for the maintenance. However, attention should {{be paid to the}} maximum tensile stresses appearing between the ceramics <b>sleeve,</b> spacer <b>rings</b> and steel shafts because the fracture toughness, plasticity and fatigue strengths of ceramics are extremely lower than the values of steel. In this study, finite element method analysis is applied to the new structure, and the maximum tensile stress and stress amplitude have been investigated with varying the dimensions of the structure. Fatigue strengths of ceramics are also considered under several geometrical conditions...|$|R

A synchronizer mechanism as {{a key component of}} a transmission system must be able to prevent transmission gears from shocking, reduce the noise and it has a great impact on driving comfort and transmission efficiency. Gear shifting improvement with respect to smooth, quick and energy efficient synchronizer’s performance is still an important issue for automotive industry. A synchronization process comprises several phases within which presynchronization, main synchronization, pre-engagement and engagement phases can be recognized. Aiming an understanding of internal dynamics and existing possibilities for optimization of synchronization processes in transmission systems during the main synchronization phase an engineering model of a generic synchronizer mechanism is proposed. The synchronizer mechanism is modeled by a contacting triple-body system consisting of the selector <b>sleeve,</b> the blocker <b>ring</b> and the gearwheel. The algorithm has developed to solve the direct dynamics synchronization problem for the generic synchronizer mechanism. By using the developed algorithm the rotational motion of the contacting triple-body system and the synchronizing torques between contacting interfaces are determined for given vehicle resistance torque, the drag torque, and the control torque applied to the selector sleeve that all together satisfy the equations of motion and guarantee synchronization of the rotational speeds of the <b>sleeve,</b> the blocker <b>ring</b> and the gearwheel for the final time. It is shown that the solution to the direct dynamics synchronization problem for the generic synchronizer mechanism is not unique and it allows formulation different optimization problems. Mathematical statement of multi-objective Pareto optimal control problem for synchronizer mechanism is given. Within the proposed model of the generic synchronizer mechanism the time-comfort Pareto optimal control problem is considered. Assuming that the resistance torque on the synchronizer owing to the vehicle inertia, the drag torque, and the synchronizing torques at the contacting interfaces are substantially constant during the main phase of a synchronization process, the solution to the time-comfort Pareto optimal control problem has been obtained. It was shown that there exist the external control torque (or shift force) applied to the selector sleeve such that the synchronization of rotational speeds of the <b>sleeve,</b> the blocker <b>ring</b> and the gearwheel is guaranteed and the synchronization process is optimal both with respect to minimal possible synchronization time as well as lowest possible inertial load acting on the synchronizer mechanism. Analysis of the obtained Pareto solution is presented...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{promoted}} {{the concept that}} rectus muscles pass through connective tissue pulleys located near the equator of the eye and act, in effect, as the muscle origins. Orbital muscle fibres (facing bone) terminate in pulleys, permitting adjustment of their position independent of the global fibres responsible for rotating the eye. The structure of pulleys (or muscle sleeves) and the passage taken by their muscle fibre insertions are unclear, and a detailed description is presented here together with {{a review of the}} active pulley hypothesis. Segments including the full width of single muscles were removed from the full orbital contents of dissection room cadavers and fresh perfusion-fixed rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys and prepared for light microscopy. Thin longitudinal sections were cut as facets from resin-embedded tissue blocks and montages assembled. Interrupted serial sections of selected regions of both species and ultrathin sections of monkey material were prepared for light and electron microscopy, respectively. Slender tendons leave the orbital surface of rectus muscles at intervals, aggregating and entering sleeves in humans and monkey; less frequently, tendons pass from the global surface to sleeves or insert directly in the posterior fascia bulbi. The orbital sides of <b>sleeve</b> <b>rings</b> are continuous with the fascial canopy of the globe and are 5 – 6 times as thick as the global sides; sleeve structure differs in the four recti. Medial rectus sleeves are the thickest, and contain smooth muscle, whereas little or none is present in the other rectus sleeves. Superior rectus sleeves are variable in structure and relatively insubstantial. A narrow interval separates muscles from the surrounding connective tissue equatorially in some preparations, consistent with a capacity to slide, but the tissues are contiguous in others, especially in monkey material. The structural organization of sleeves and their tendons, together with other presented factors, is inconsistent with a facility for the separate adjustment of sleeve position. The results favour the theory that sleeve tendons have just one role, to counter the viscoelastic resistance of global fascia – ocular and sleeve muscle fibres acting in unison. Whether the fragile sleeve structure can meet the physical demands of pulleys is questionable; but otherwise the veracity of the pulley hypothesis cannot be assessed from the structural relations of muscles and fascia bulbi reported...|$|R

40|$|Historically, {{cryogenic}} pumps {{used for}} propellant loading at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and other NASA Centers have a bellows mechanical seal and oil bath ball bearings, {{both of which}} can be problematic and require high maintenance. Because of the extremely low temperatures, the mechanical seals are made of special materials and design, have wearing surfaces, are subject to improper installation, and commonly are a potential leak path. The ball bearings are non-precision bearings [ABEC- 1 (Annular Bearing Engineering Council) ] and are lubricated using LOX compatible oil. This oil is compatible with the propellant to prevent explosions, but does not have good lubricating properties. Due to the poor lubricity, it has been a goal of the KSC cryogenics community for the last 15 years to develop a magnetically coupled pump, which would eliminate these two potential issues. A number of projects have been attempted, but none of the pumps was a success. An off-the-shelf magnetically coupled pump (typically used with corrosive fluids) was procured that has been used for hypergolic service at KSC. The KSC Cryogenics Test Lab (CTL) operated the pump in cryogenic LN 2 as received to determine a baseline for modifications required. The pump bushing, bearings, and thrust rings failed, and the pump would not flow liquid (this is a typical failure mode that was experienced in the previous attempts). Using the knowledge gained over the years designing and building cryogenic pumps, the CTL determined alternative materials that would be suitable for use under the pump design conditions. The CTL procured alternative materials for the bearings (bronze, aluminum bronze, and glass filled PTFE) and machined new bearing bushings, <b>sleeves,</b> and thrust <b>rings.</b> The designed clearances among the bushings, <b>sleeves,</b> thrust <b>rings,</b> case, and case cover were altered once again using experience gained from previous cryogenic pump rebuilds and designs. The alternative material parts were assembled into the pump, and the pump was successfully operated meeting all expected operating parameters. Unique pump sub-assembly parts were designed and manufactured by the CTL using specialized materials determined to be superior for cryogenic thermal applications under the pump design conditions. This work is a proof-of-concept/proof-of-operation of the pump only. Other known internal design modifications to the pump should be accomplished for the long-term use of the pump. An upscaled version of this pump, which is under development and testing at the CTL, can be used either for current or future vehicle loading or for vehicle replenishment. Scaling of this pump can be easily accomplished...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary vein (PV) sleeves, {{composed}} of cardiomyocytes, play certain roles in arrhythmogenesis.
