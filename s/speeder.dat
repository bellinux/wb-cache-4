5|$|Players {{are rewarded}} with cash for {{attaining}} high speeds, placing highly in races and obtaining the Flip-Score power-up. Cash {{can be used}} in between races to upgrade their <b>speeder</b> by purchasing new parts. Parts are split into four categories - chassis, cooler, engine and front shield, with each affecting the <b>speeder</b> in different ways. Some tracks may favour a particular set-up over others.|$|E
5|$|Heat {{levels on}} the <b>speeder</b> must be monitored, as {{although}} there are no set top speeds for the vehicles, they can explode if allowed to overheat. Heat builds up from acceleration and from collisions. To counteract this, the player may activate the onboard cooler, however, this will slow the vehicle down. Designated cooling strips along the track and the Ice power-up can cool the vehicle without a speed penalty, allowing the player to continue accelerating.|$|E
5|$|While at Hampshire, Smith {{formed the}} band Heatmiser with classmate Neil Gust. After Smith {{graduated}} from Hampshire, the band added drummer Tony Lash and bassist Brandt Peterson and began performing around Portland in 1992. The group released the albums Dead Air (1993) and Cop and <b>Speeder</b> (1994) {{as well as}} the Yellow No. 5 EP (1994) on Frontier Records. They were then signed to Virgin Records to release what became their final album, Mic City Sons (1996).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Speeders</b> Fight Back (TruTV network, 2008-09) is both {{dependent}} on and spun {{off from the}} reality legal series <b>Speeders,</b> which was also aired on TruTV. <b>Speeders</b> Fight Back is a program that saw offending motorists from the <b>Speeders</b> program challenge the officers that pulled them over in court. Said individuals used visual aids, alibis, emotional and offbeat excuses {{to get out of}} their traffic tickets. (See also the television court series Traffic Court, listed in above section).|$|R

5|$|Set in 2090, {{the game}} is centred on a fictional extreme racing sport known as Ballistics, a {{descendant}} of Formula One. The player takes {{the role of a}} Ballistic's pilot, racing hoverbikes called speeders through the inside of tubes which form the courses. The speeders are magnetically attached to the race surface, allowing the player 360 degrees of movement along the left/right axis. The player can detach the <b>speeder</b> from the track and navigate down the center in order to avoid track obstacles and to acquire the power-ups exclusively located there. Players must try to follow the outside of each curve, as hitting the inside of a curve at speed could lead to an involuntary detachment, leading to a loss of control and seconds dropped in securing reattachment.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads-up display}} {{features}} a health meter, a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons. The player can control five craft: X-wing, A-wing, Y-wing, snowspeeder and V-wing. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, {{as well as}} varying degrees of speed and maneuverability. The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available craft. Levels set on non-atmospheric moons expose the player's craft to space; thus disallowing the <b>Speeder</b> and V-Wing (which are repulsorcraft) from being used; but as on other levels, the craft is vertically confined. Nine bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses improve a craft's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft {{for the remainder of}} the game.|$|E

30|$|We found a {{substantive}} gap between subjective and objective data regarding traffic violations, {{but they were}} also significantly correlated. The demographic variables, including gender, failed to distinguish between frequent and non-frequent <b>speeders,</b> while attitudinal variables succeeded. Frequent <b>speeders</b> required a significantly higher potential reward, as well as a higher fine to motivate behavioral changes.|$|R

5|$|<b>Speeders</b> have a boost meter, {{showing how}} much fuel is {{available}} for the onboard speed boost. Although the boost provides greater speeds and acceleration than the standard throttle, it also increases the <b>speeder's</b> heat levels. Designated booster load zones along the track replenish the meter, and a super boost power-up is available which doubles the potency of the boost.|$|R

25|$|A Steadicam rig was {{employed}} {{during the filming}} of Return of the Jedi, in conjunction with two gyroscopes for extra stabilization, to film the background plates for the <b>speeder</b> bike chase. Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown operated the shot, walking through a redwood forest, running the camera at one frame per second. When projected at 24 frames per second, it {{gave the impression of}} flying through the air at perilous speeds.|$|E
25|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{is able to}} pilot various space craft, {{including}} the Millennium Falcon, to help the Rebel Alliance defeat the Galactic Empire's forces. Other space ships that can be piloted in the game include a <b>speeder</b> bike from the film Return of the Jedi, an X-wing, and a landspeeder. They are used in either close range battles or high-speed flying action. The fast landspeeder, for example, is used in a level in which the player has to finish a race before the time runs out. The weapons and protective shields on the space ships can be upgraded.|$|E
50|$|Crossminton can {{be played}} outside and inside, the court can be painted or pegged off. There is even the {{possibility}} to use a portable court. Crossminton played in the dark is called Blackminton.

25|$|Gameplay in Battlefront is conquest-based. Each faction has {{a finite}} amount of reinforcements, and each is given {{control of a}} set number of command posts in a given level. The object is to either {{eliminate}} enemy forces or capture and hold all command posts simultaneously for 20 seconds. Several ground and air vehicles {{are available on the}} battlefield. These range from the hulking AT-AT to the fast <b>speeder</b> bike and vary based on the level. There are more than 25 vehicles in-game. Some larger vehicles also function as mobile command posts, which cannot be captured, but are lost if the vehicle is destroyed. In addition, some maps have indigenous forces. These can be neutral to both factions, such as Jawas, hostile to one faction, such as Wookies, or hostile to both factions, such as Tusken Raiders. Command posts belonging to hostile natives can also be captured to minimize their presence.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the [...] that {{emphasizes}} space combat simulation, Rogue Squadron is a fast-paced, arcade-style action game. Each of the game's sixteen levels introduces mission objectives {{that must be}} completed to progress to the next level. These objectives are divided into four categories: search and destroy, reconnaissance, rescue, and protect. Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of TIE fighters. Ground defenses are more varied and include three different walkers, laser and missile turrets, tanks, probe droids, shuttles, stormtroopers and <b>speeder</b> bikes.|$|E
500|$|Battle for Naboo {{includes}} {{a number of}} unlockable secrets. The player can unlock three bonus levels: [...] "Trade Federation Secrets", [...] "Coruscant Encounter" [...] and [...] "Dark Side". These levels are made available when the player obtains all bronze, silver or gold medals, respectively, on every level. Alternatively, they can be unlocked via password. Several craft are also available when unlocked. The Sith Infiltrator, a Swamp <b>Speeder</b> and an AAT may be selected when the player enters the correct passwords or achieves all gold or platinum medals, respectively, on all levels. A TIE fighter and a playable model of a 1969 Buick Electra 225 based on a car owned by the game's sound designer, Rudolph Stember, can be unlocked via password only.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the aliens, other visual effects were required for the speeders, the alien spaceship, its interior, environment re-creations, and the head-up display for Jake's arm gauntlet. For {{the invasion of the}} town of Absolution, both practical laser lighting and fire effects were utilized, along with practical ships and effects enhancements. ILM artists had to enhance the initial look of the alien [...] "bolos", the cables used to abduct people, with renderings such as extra lights, after viewers thought the studio had failed to [...] "paint out" [...] the cables in the film’s first trailer. For a scene in which Jake and Ella ride on a <b>speeder,</b> the actors were filming on a practical mock-up against bluescreen; they were digitally replaced in wider shots.|$|E
500|$|The film's novelization {{was written}} by Matthew Stover. It {{includes}} much more dialogue than the film, including: a conversation between Count Dooku and Darth Sidious, where the reader learns Palpatine lied to Dooku about what the Empire would truly be; a conversation between Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi where Obi-Wan expresses self-doubt about whether he is the right Jedi to battle General Grievous; and a conversation between Anakin and Palpatine in which Palpatine promises to give Anakin anything he wants—whether it be a new <b>speeder</b> or the star system Corellia. The novel includes many minor details. For example, during the Battle of Coruscant, Anakin's callsign is Red 5, a reference to Luke's callsign in the climactic battle of A New Hope, {{and one of the}} Republic capital ships is commanded by Lieutenant Commander Lorth Needa, who becomes Captain Needa in The Empire Strikes Back. There are also references to the [...] comic book series, such as the Battle of Jabiim (Volume 3). In addition to this, the siege of the Jedi Temple is much more violent and far more graphically explained than the cinematic version.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935 <b>Speeder</b> {{came into}} the {{ownership}} of [...] Puget Sound Navigation Co. when PSN acquired Kitsap County Transportation Co. and the entire KCTC fleet.

[...] In 1942, <b>Speeder</b> was acquired by Boles Harbor Island Ferries. [...] The cabins of the vessel were cut down and the vessel was then and placed on a route running shipyard workers from downtown Seattle to the yards on Harbor Island. [...] Master of the vessel in this service was Joe D. Williamson, who later became known as a prominent maritime photographer.
