40|$|Designing a {{building}} is a complex task involving specialists from different domains. The current method of overlaying 2 D Independent <b>Services</b> <b>Drawings</b> (ISD) to identify collisions between building services and structural framing is prone to errors, causing ad-hoc rework, and reduced headroom and maintainability issues. While solutions to resolve collisions spatially in software exist, {{most of them are}} based on tessellated mesh representations approximating the geometry of the design objects. This approach is memory and computation-intensive. Furthermore, it can neither identify all possible clashes nor solve clashes reliably. This paper outlines a clash identification and resolution approach based on the original design parameters of the objects which requires less computations, is more accurate, and can identify all object collisions. It allows the extension to automatic resolution. This approach has been implemented in a prototype system based on Revit MEP 2009. A case study is shown here to illustrate its feasibility. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R

The dimensions are taken from the <b>service</b> kit <b>drawings,</b> assumptions and also using vernier calipers. The main idea of this project is to develop 2 -D drawings and convert them to 3 D by using computer aided software (CAD), Pro-E Wildfire 4. 0. Other goals were to design core cavity extraction of forging component for machining and also generate NC codes for machining process. Pro-E, a very advanced CAD software, helps to improve the Design with ease, do the Design, Drawing, NC code generation and Manufacturing process in one place which helps to reduce time and cost. It {{has the ability to}} interface with the CNC machine to directly run the machining process with less effort. Cosmos Works is being used for Finite Element Analysis. The main idea of this design is it can be easily altered for any vehicle with respect to its conditions...|$|R

The <b>service</b> completed construction <b>drawings</b> for architecture firms {{that were not}} able to handle the sudden influx of projects. He then went on to work for Defense Construction Limited, a government organization formed in 1951 with the mandate to expedite construction of military projects due to the Korean War. From there, he obtained a position with the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, a government organization established in 1946 to deal with post-war housing shortages. CMHC transferred Bemi to Ottawa where he continued to practice for the remainder of his career.|$|R

Method: This is a qualitative research, which presents the perspectives of 17 teachers from nine occupational therapy courses {{in the state of}} São Paulo. Results:We categorized subjects associated to the study objective and present two categories: theoretical orientation - which includes the study of the referential Alma Ata (1978); Health Reform; critical understanding of the Unified Health System, the PHC and the profession specificity in this field involving understanding of the devices used by the teams occupational therapist and their working tools, social vulnerability understanding, everyday life and institutional context involving services and their management. The Practice Scenarios has been identified a plurality of <b>services</b> and <b>drawings</b> management where theoretical activities practices are developed, pointed out the difficulty of conducting training for this professional field. Moreover, the absence of workers on PHC hinders health care and also impairs the students training from different professional areas. Conclusion: The professional category must value since training, the learning of new care technologies compatible with their knowledge and occupational therapeutic resources towards the population’s access to different practices for comprehensive health care, including the care of occupational therapy in PHC...|$|R

A contracting company, Bintang Mulia Persada engaged in the development or construction projects, including in the areas of: chartering of buildings, construction in the planning and execution, architectural services, interior design <b>services</b> and <b>drawings.</b> The company was established since February 6, 1999. Measurement of revenue must be done by looking at fair value compensation accepted or acceptable. Total revenue arising from a transaction is usually determined by agreement between the company and the purchaser or user of the asset. Disclosure of revenue which are recognized by companies in development projects Bangil District Court in 2009 was Rp. 286. 857 million, while the realization of the reported costs in development projects Bangil District Court in 2009 in accordance with the Fee Schedule which made the company is Rp. 318 730 million.

40|$|Under central planning, {{services}} industries {{were generally}} neglected. Marxist thinking {{emphasized the importance}} of tangible (material) inputs as determinants of economic development, and classified employment in the services sector as unproductive. Since 1990, the services sector has grown rapidly in the countries of Central-Eastern Europe Region. Foreign investment, especially foreign direct investment (FDI), has {{played an important role in}} this process. But there are some important differences between goods and services trade. While much of trade theory has developed around the trading of goods, less theoretical and empirical work has focused on trade in services. While some <b>services</b> (architectural <b>drawings,</b> consultant reports etc.) are tangible, visible, and storable and are thus like many other goods, many services require direct interaction between producers and consumers. This proximity requirement means that for many services, factors of production (labor and capital) must be mobile for international transactions to occur. For this reason, the real barriers to increased trade in services are not simply tariffs, but rather, beyond those at the border. Clearly removing barriers to trade in fundamental services such as transportation, communications, information processing etc. will help to facilitate economy-wide gains. Nevertheless services themselves are becoming increasingly tradable as a result of the greater mobility of people and developments in information, computer, and telecommunications industries. The purpose of this paper is to analyse main factors influencing services trade. services trade, technological, progress, services liberalization, domestic policies...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} an empirical investigation revealing the critical obstacles {{to the adoption}} of a uniform pricing mechanism for building services from the perspective of industry practitioners. A total of 157 questionnaires conducted on quantity surveyors (N= 75), mechanical engineers (N= 39) and electrical engineers (N= 43) were collected and used for the study. T -test statistics was run to identify ten significant factors from a list of fourteen factors identified. Relative importance indices were computed for each factor from the perspectives of the practitioners so as to determine the most critical obstructive factors. The result shows that the five most important obstructive factors in order of significance are: (1) difficulty in the interpretation of the Standard Method of Measurement by design consultants (2) the late involvement of building services design consultants (3) quantity surveyors' insufficient skill in mechanical and electrical <b>services</b> technology (4) <b>drawings</b> of <b>services</b> are often not ready for billing at the tender stage and (5) the lack of a generally accepted Standard Method of Measurement for mechanical and electrical services...|$|R
