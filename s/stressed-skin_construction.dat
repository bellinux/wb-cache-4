25|$|The Don was {{designed}} to meet Air Ministry Specification T.6/36 for a multi-role trainer and was a single-engined monoplane of wooden <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction.</b> The DH.93 Don {{was intended to be}} a trainer for pilots and radio operators, and as a gunnery trainer, the gunnery requirement involved the mounting of a dorsal gun turret. Student pilot and instructor sat side by side up front, while accommodation for a trainee WT (radio) operator and the turret gunner was behind in the cabin.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction,</b> Reggiane introduced several advanced features on the Re.2000, such as a modern structure, which was considerably more advanced than the ones used in Macchi's and other Italian fighters of the time, along with an elliptical wing profile. Overall, the design possessed greater aerodynamic sophistication in comparison to other Italian rivals rivals such as the Fiat G.50 and Macchi C.200. The Re.2000 was furnished with retractable landing gear; the main gear retracted via the Curtiss method, the wheels rotating around to face flat within the wheel wells when retracted. The atypical fairing covered the landing gear's actuation mechanism, while the legs incorporated hydraulic shock absorbers and drag struts to effective absorb loads; pneumatic brakes were also fitted. The tail wheel was both retractable and steerable.|$|E

50|$|The Gamma was {{a further}} {{development}} of the successful Northrop Alpha and shared its predecessor's aerodynamic innovations with wing fillets and multicellular <b>stressed-skin</b> wing <b>construction.</b> Like late Alphas, the fixed landing gear was covered in distinctive aerodynamic spats, and the aircraft introduced a fully enclosed cockpit.|$|R
50|$|The SAM-5 was a {{cantilever}} high-wing monoplane with fixed conventional {{landing gear}} and an enclosed cabin for a pilot and four passengers. The first prototype was built using <b>stressed-skin</b> light alloy <b>construction</b> but it had problems {{with the quality of}} workmanship in what was an unfamiliar material. The second-prototype SAM-5bis was built using plywood and fabric and had wing bracing and a more slender fuselage. After testing 37 production aircraft were built and they were delivered from 1937 as air ambulances with room for three patients and an attendant.|$|R
25|$|The Fairey Battle was a {{single-engine}} monoplane light bomber, {{powered by}} a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. Production aircraft were progressively powered by various models of the Merlin engine, such as the Merlin I, II, III and V. The Battle had a relatively clean design, having adopted a slim oval-shaped fuselage which was manufactured in two separate sections. The forward section, {{in front of the}} cockpit, relied mainly upon a steel tubular structure to support the weight of the nose-mounted engine; the rear section was of a metal monocoque structure comprised hoop frames and Z-section stringers which was built on jigs. The structure of the aircraft involved several innovations and firsts for Fairey, it had the distinction of being the company's first low-wing monoplane; it also was the first implementation of a light-alloy <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction</b> to be produced by the firm.|$|E
500|$|Under the plan, on 12 July 1938, the Air Ministry {{bought a}} site {{consisting}} of farm fields and a sewage works next to Castle Bromwich Aerodrome in Birmingham. This shadow factory would supplement Supermarine's original factories in Southampton {{in building the}} Spitfire. The Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory (CBAF) ordered the most modern machine tools then available, which were being installed two months after work started on the site. Although Morris Motors under Lord Nuffield (an expert in mass motor-vehicle construction) at first managed and equipped the factory, it was funded by government money. When the project was first discussed {{it was estimated that}} the factory would be built for £2,000,000, however, by the beginning of 1939 this cost had doubled to over £4,000,000. The Spitfire's <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction</b> required precision engineering skills and techniques outside the experience of the local labour force, which took some time to train. However, even as the first Spitfires were being built in June 1940, the factory was still incomplete, and there were numerous problems with the factory management, which ignored tooling and drawings provided by Supermarine in favour of tools and drawings of its own designs, and with the workforce which, while not completely stopping production, continually threatened strikes or [...] "slow downs" [...] until their demands for higher than average pay rates were met.|$|E
2500|$|Czechoslovakia {{chose the}} MB.200 {{as part of}} a {{modernisation}} program for its air force of the [...] mid-1930s. [...] Although at the rate of aircraft development at that time, the MB.200 would quickly become obsolete, the Czechoslovakians needed a quick solution involving the license production of a proven design, as their own aircraft industry did not have sufficient development experience with such a large aircraft, or with all-metal airframes and <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction,</b> placing an initial order for 74 aircraft. After some delays, both Aero and Avia began license-production in 1937, with [...] a total of about 124 built. Czechoslovakian MB.200s were basically similar to their French counterparts, with differences in defensive armament and other equipment.|$|E
2500|$|The fleet {{was ordered}} by the British Transport Commission as direct {{comparison}} with British Rail Class 40, and were not actually wanted by the Western Region, who preferred their production fleet of D800 Warships. [...] The D600s {{were the result of}} power politics within the BTC and the WR: the former was unwilling to sanction radical, <b>stressed-skin</b> lightweight <b>construction</b> locomotives at the time, while the latter was equally insistent {{that at least some of}} the new Type 4 power range locomotives on order be equipped with hydraulic transmission. [...] They were much heavier than production Warships (almost [...] compared to [...] ) and can be regarded as standard 1950s British design diesel locomotives that just happened to contain two lightweight, high-revving diesel engines coupled to hydraulic transmissions rather than one large, slow-revving diesel engine and electrical generator set. [...] For this reason they were practically obsolete in design terms before they had left the drawing board.|$|R
50|$|There is however, {{controversy}} and doubt regarding this story. It {{did not appear}} until 1958, and no reference to {{it has been found}} in contemporary sources. It has since been established that von Brauchitsch had raced a streamlined silver SSKL on the AVUS in 1932, which was called a Silver Arrow in live radio coverage. Also, in 1934, both Mercedes and Auto Union had entered the Avusrennen with silver cars. The next big event was the 1934 Eifelrennen, but as few cars complying to the new rules were ready, it was held for Formule Libre, so weight was still not a race-critical issue at that time. By the 1930s, modern <b>stressed-skin</b> aircraft fuselage <b>construction</b> was already using polished and unpainted aluminium panels for streamlining and to save weight. Also the wealthy motor-racing fraternity would have been aware that in heraldry, white and silver are the same colour, or 'tincture', described as 'Argent'; (similarly yellow and gold are both called 'Or').|$|R
2500|$|When Jack Northrop {{set up the}} Northrop Corporation as a {{joint venture}} with the Douglas Aircraft Company in 1932, he set out to design two closely related single-engined {{aircraft}} as the new company's first products: a mailplane/record-breaking aircraft, which was designated the Gamma, and a passenger transport, the Delta. [...] The Delta was a low-winged monoplane, with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. It was of all-metal, <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction,</b> with streamlining spats covering the main landing gear. [...] While the Delta's wings were common with those of the Gamma, it had a new, wider fuselage, which seated the pilot in an enclosed cockpit immediately behind the engine, and had accommodation for eight passengers in a cabin behind the pilot.|$|E
2500|$|Design of the Loire-Nieuport 10 {{started in}} 1937, with the {{resultant}} aircraft being a twin-engined monoplane of all-metal <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction</b> with inverted gull (or W-shaped) wings.

50|$|Like GM's over-the-road buses, {{including}} the Greyhound Scenicruiser, the air-sprung New Look {{did not have}} a traditional ladder frame. Instead it used an airplane-like <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction</b> in which an aluminum riveted skin supported the weight of the bus. The wooden floor kept the bus's shape. The engine cradle was hung off the back of the roof. As a result, the GM New Look weighed significantly less than competitors' city buses.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. Navy's ZMC-2 {{was one of}} the few {{airships}} to {{be constructed}} in the late 1920s. An all-metal airship was not a completely new idea; the first metal-skinned rigid airship was completed by David Schwarz in the 1890s. The constructors of the ZMC-2, however, developed a system of framework integrated with <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction</b> that presaged both the pressurized fuselage construction utilised decades later in commercial airliners, and even elements of American lunar rockets, such as the Saturn V launch vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The Beardmore Inflexible of 1928 had a {{wingspan}} of 157 ft and an all up {{weight of}} 37,000 lbs. However it was underpowered {{for such a}} heavy aircraft.

50|$|The Blenheim {{was one of}} {{the first}} British {{aircraft}} to feature an all-metal <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction,</b> retractable landing gear, flaps, a powered gun turret and variable-pitch propellers. The design of the Blenheim proved to be readily adaptable, and was modified to serve in roles such as an interim long-range fighter and as a night fighter, pending the availability of a more advanced fighter derivative of the Blenheim, the Beaufighter. A more capable bomber derivative, the Beaufort, was also developed, being both larger and heavier than the Blenheim.|$|E

50|$|As part of {{its efforts}} {{to get back into}} {{aircraft}} manufacturing following the war, Breda commissioned Mario Pittoni to develop a twin-engine medium transport designated the Breda-Pittoni B.P.471. The prototype first flew in 1950. It was an all-metal twin-engine monoplane of <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction.</b> It had a retractable tricycle undercarriage and wings were of an inverted-gull configuration, this allowed the main landing gear to be short and light. The cabin had room for 18-passengers or freight. The company proposed many uses for the aircraft including a civil airliner and freighter, military navigation trainer or utility freighter. With no interest from buyers the prototype was operated by the Italian Air Ministry as a staff transport.|$|E

50|$|The YF-17 was {{primarily}} constructed of aluminum, in conventional semi-monocoque <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction,</b> though over 900 lb (408 kg) of its structure were graphite/epoxy composite. The small nose contained a simple ranging radar. The cockpit sported an ejection seat inclined at 18°, a bubble canopy, and a head-up display (HUD). The thin wings carried no fuel, and {{in areas such}} as the leading and trailing edge and the LERX, were composed of a Nomex honeycomb core with composite facesheets. The rear of the aircraft featured twin all-moving stabilators of aluminum over a honeycomb core, and twin vertical stabilizers of a conventional construction. Like the wings, the leading and trailing edges were constructed of composite facesheets over honeycomb core. A composite speedbrake was located above and between the engines.|$|E
50|$|Powered by a Bristol Mercury radial engine, the Type 133 was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane and was {{the first}} aircraft intended for RAF service with a retractable undercariage. It was also the first Bristol aircraft to use <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction</b> for the wings, using recently invented Alclad sheets. The wings were of constant chord out to rounded tips and of cranked, or inverted gull wing, form, with negative dihedral in the centre section and positive dihedral beyond. The fabric-covered ailerons extended over the whole of the outer wing and could be lowered symmetrically (drooped) in lieu of traditional flaps. The horizontal tail was of quite high aspect ratio and aluminium-covered, carrying horn-balanced, fabric-covered elevators. The rudder was similarly horn-balanced and fabric-covered.|$|E
50|$|The Galeb {{is powered}} by a single Armstrong Siddeley Viper II Mark 22/6 {{turbojet}} engine, capable of providing up to 2,500lb of thrust. According to Flight International, the Viper engine provides the aircraft to perform rapid and stall-free acceleration under all conditions. The Galeb has a simple structure, using conventional <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction</b> using frames and bulkheads. The rear fuselage, which attaches to the main fuselage of the aircraft just behind the cockpit canopy, enables a high level of accessibility to the engine and the surrounding section; the forward fuselage contains to the tandem cockpit, integral center-section, and most systems. Tail unit pick-up points are present on the rear fuselage bulkhead. The Galeb features an all-metal straight wing, complete with tip tanks; the landing gear retracts into the wings rather than the fuselage.|$|E
5000|$|The NBL-built D800s {{differed}} mechanically {{from the}} Swindon-built batch: the Swindon locomotives used Maybach engines connected to Mekydro hydraulic transmissions whereas the NBL-built examples used MAN engines and Voith transmissions. NBL had entered into an {{arrangement with the}} German company MAN AG in the early 1950s to market MAN's engine designs in the UK: NBL were anxious to enter the diesel locomotive market, especially once {{it became apparent that}} British Railways would be seeking large quantities of such locomotives when the [...] "Modernisation Plan" [...] was announced. MAN were equally keen to obtain a slice of the UK market for themselves.

50|$|The Dewoitine HD.730 was {{designed}} by Emile Dewoitine's team at the Société nationale des constructions aéronautiques du Midi (SNCAM), which was formed in 1937 when Dewoitine's Société Aéronautique Française was nationalised, {{in order to meet}} a French Navy requirement for a light catapult-launched observation aircraft, with two prototypes ordered in 1938. It was a low-wing monoplane of all-metal <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction.</b> It was fitted with an inverted gull-wing, which folded immediately outboard of the twin floats to aid storage onboard ship, and it had twin tail fins. The two-man crew or pilot and observer sat in tandem under an enclosed canopy. The observer was armed with a single flexibly mounted machine gun and a fixed machine gun was operated by the pilot. It was powered by a single 164 kW (220 hp) Renault 6Q inverted six-cylinder air-cooled piston engine driving a two-blade propeller.|$|E

5000|$|The Arsenal-Delanne 10-C2 two-seat fighter, {{designed}} by Maurice Delanne and {{built by the}} Arsenal de l'Aéronautique, was of so-called Nenadovich biplane or tandem wing configuration, the tandem-mounted wings providing a continuous slot effect and offering exceptional center of gravity range. The fighter was of all metal <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction,</b> which used a sandwich technique, with a smooth dural skin welded to a corrugated sheet. Pilot and gunner sat in tandem under a single canopy {{at the rear of}} the fuselage, which was level with the rear wing, which carried twin tailplanes. This arrangement gave the gunner a clear field of fire for his planned armament of two 7.5 mm machine guns, which was to be supplemented by a 20 mm cannon firing through the propellor hub and two more machine guns in the wing. The aircraft was fitted with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage and was powered by a single [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs 12-cylinder liquid-cooled engine.|$|E
50|$|A typical air yacht of {{the early}} 1920s was the Kirkham Air Yacht, built {{to the order of}} Harold Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt {{intended}} it for transport between his business offices in New York and the family estate at Newport, Rhode Island. Like the contemporary Loening Flying Yacht, it included an enclosed passenger cabin for four with an open pilot's cockpit ahead. Both were of the most modern construction, as monoplanes with duralumin <b>stressed-skin</b> <b>construction.</b> A difference was that the Loening used a war-surplus Liberty engine whilst the Kirkham had the latest, and more powerful, British Napier Lion. Both were flying boats, able to land on any expanse of open water, which was available to the rich at both New York and their seaside country homes. The journey to Newport could be made in around two hours, three times faster than by train and still twice as fast as the journey by car today. As public airfields developed in this decade, later aircraft became amphibians, making them more flexible about their destinations.|$|E
