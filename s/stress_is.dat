5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull <b>stress</b> <b>is</b> concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E

30|$|The complex {{geological}} conditions. The south {{wing rail}} roadway passes through several strata, including mudstone, san-mudstone, fine sandstone, and coal seam.

The maximum principal <b>stresses</b> <b>are</b> 19 and 18.52  MPa respectively; while the minimum principal <b>stresses</b> <b>are</b> 9.12 and 8.63  MPa; the intermediate principal <b>stresses</b> <b>are</b> 16.25 and 15.67  MPa, respectively.

The axial direction of the roadway is approximately perpendicular to the maximum horizontal principal stress direction. This situation is unfavorable for the roadway maintenance.|$|R
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of {{pearl millet}} to soil water deficits {{at different times}} of growth was determined in field experiments conducted over 2 years. Grain yields and yield components were expressed as ratios of stressed to non-stressed treatments. Where water deficit was imposed earlier in crop growth and then relieved, the time of termination of stress from flowering determined the extent of grain yield loss. Water stress relieved at anthesis or early grain filling had little adverse effect on the grain yield because additional tillers produced panicles. This response by tillers was less evident and grain yields were more severely reduced when water <b>stress</b> <b>was</b> not relieved until after flowering. When <b>stress</b> <b>was</b> imposed late in crop growth and not relieved, the time of initiation of <b>stress</b> <b>was</b> directly related to the extent of loss in grain yield.

5|$|While all the {{reaction}} mechanisms {{of these species}} within the body are not yet fully understood, {{one of the most}} reactive products of oxidative <b>stress</b> <b>is</b> the hydroxyl radical (·OH), which can initiate a damaging chain reaction of lipid peroxidation in the unsaturated lipids within cell membranes. High concentrations of oxygen also increase the formation of other free radicals, such as nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and trioxidane, which harm DNA and other biomolecules. Although the body has many antioxidant systems such as glutathione that guard against oxidative stress, these systems are eventually overwhelmed at very high concentrations of free oxygen, and the rate of cell damage exceeds the capacity of the systems that prevent or repair it. Cell damage and cell death then result.|$|E
5|$|In Quenya, the {{stressing}} of a syllable is {{predictable and}} non-phonemic (i.e. {{the meaning of}} a word never changes depending on the stress), but it is partly determined by syllable weight. Words of two syllables are stressed on the first syllable. In words of three or more syllables, the <b>stress</b> <b>is</b> on the penultimate syllable if this is heavy, otherwise on the antepenultimate syllable, i.e. the third-to-last syllable. In Quenya, heavy syllables are syllables that contain either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a cluster of two consonants (ll, ld, mm, ss, etc.). Certain combinations of consonants, e.g. ny, ry, are also regarded as heavy. Medially hy and hw are long consonants in Parmaquesta (not colloquially in Tarquesta) and a vowel before them is held to constitute a metrically long syllable. Quenya has also a secondary accent. The placement of stress and the distinction between heavy and light syllables is important in Quenya verse.|$|E
5|$|The finger {{bones of}} bats {{are much more}} {{flexible}} than those of other mammals, owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of minerals, such as calcium, near their tips. The elongation of bat digits, a key feature required for wing development, {{is due to the}} upregulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps). During embryonic development, the gene controlling Bmp signaling, Bmp2, is subjected to increased expression in bat forelimbs—resulting in the extension of the manual digits. This crucial genetic alteration helps create the specialized limbs required for volant locomotion. The relative proportion of extant bat forelimb digits compared with those of Eocene fossil bats have no significant differences in relative digit proportion, suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over 50 million years. During flight, the bones take on bending and shearing stress; and the bending stresses felt are smaller than terrestrial mammals, however the shearing <b>stress</b> <b>is</b> larger. The wing bones of bats have a slightly lower breaking stress point than those of birds.|$|E

Knowledge of the induced residual <b>stresses</b> <b>is</b> important as they affect the beneficial bridging effect of the strap.

5|$|Traditional desert farming {{systems have}} long been {{established}} in North Africa, irrigation being {{the key to success}} in an area where water <b>stress</b> <b>is</b> a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include drip irrigation, the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further crop production preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of erosion. It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated into the soil {{in the vicinity of the}} plants. A study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions. A field trial in the Sonoran Desert which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the nitrogen fixing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially successful.|$|E
