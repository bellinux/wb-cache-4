40|$|The {{implementation}} of site-specific land drainage system designs is usually disregarded by landowners {{in favour of}} locally established ‘standard practice’ land drainage designs. This {{is due to a}} number of factors such as a limited understanding of soil–water interactions, lack of facilities for the measurement of soil’s physical or hydrological parameters and perceived time wastage and high costs. Hence {{there is a need for}} a site-specific drainage system design methodology that does not rely on inaccessible, time-consuming and/or expensive measurements of soil physical or hydrological properties. This requires a standardised process for deciphering the drainage characteristics of a given soil in the field. As an initial step, a new visual soil assessment method, referred to as visual drainage assessment (VDA), is presented whereby an approximation of the permeability of specific soil horizons is made using seven indicators (water <b>seepage,</b> <b>pan</b> layers, texture, porosity, consistence, stone content and root development) to provide a basis for the design of a site-specific drainage system. Across six poorly drained sites (1. 3 ha to 2. 6 ha in size) in south-west Ireland a VDA-based design was compared with (i) an ideal design (utilising soil physical measurements to elucidate soil hydraulic parameters) and (ii) a standard design (0. 8 m deep drains at a 15 m spacing) by model estimate of water table control and rainfall recharge/drain discharge capacity. The VDA method, unlike standard design equivalents, provided a good approximation of an ideal (from measured hydrological properties) design and prescribed an equivalent land drainage system in the field. Mean modelled rainfall recharge/drain discharge capacity for the VDA (13. 3 mm/day) and ideal (12. 0 mm/day) designs were significantly higher (P < 0. 001, s. e. 1. 42 mm/day) than for the standard designs (0. 5 mm/day), when assuming a design minimum water table depth of 0. 45 m. peer-reviewe...|$|E
