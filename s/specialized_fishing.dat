40|$|The {{development}} of specialized and commercial fishing {{activity in the}} island archipelago of Lofoten and Vestera°len in northern Norway is a critical foundation from which to understand the subsequent spread of commercial fishing across the north Atlantic region during the medieval and early modern period. One little understood aspect of this development {{is the relationship between}} medieval commercial fishing stations (fiskevaer) and earlier fishing activity. In this article, cultural sediment deposits at Langenesværet, Vestera°len, Northern Norway provide an opportunity to examine this relationship and its implications for current historical models of fishing development in northern Norway and the north Atlantic region. Conventional and AMS radiocarbon dating techniques are used to establish a chronology for the deposits, while activities associated with the sediments are characterized using thin-section micromorphology supported by proton induced X-ray emission spectrometry (PIXE). The results suggest that the site commenced formation as early as ca. 3000 B. C. and that the site was first used for <b>specialized</b> <b>fishing</b> activity from the early centuries A. D. The medieval commercial fiskevaer settlement at Langenesværet was introduced to an area that had a longstanding tradition of specialised fishing activity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the techno-functional study of a tool with a smooth end, typologically classifiable as spatula, made from a red deer {{metatarsal}} recovered at the early Mesolithic rock-shelter GalgenbÃ¼hel/Dos de la Forca. The site {{is located in the}} middle Adige Valley at Salurn/Salorno (South Tyrol â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Northern Italy) and was dwelled by Sauveterrian hunter-gatherer-fisher-communities from the mid- 9 th to the mid- 8 th millennium cal. BC. Subsistence was based on the exploitation of wetland and valley bottom resources including an intense and at times <b>specialized</b> <b>fishing</b> activity. The identification of a probable harpoon fragment among the few but well preserved bone and antler artefacts detected at the site could in fact be part of fishing equipment. The main goal {{of this study was to}} recognize the specific use of the tool with a smooth end by means of use-wear analysis. It is quite difficult, indeed, to establish a specific function for this kind of tools as their morphological characters make them suitable for various tasks. A dedicated experimental program was developed to this scope, which involved manufacture and use of spatula replicas for different activities: fish scaling, beading fish heads, working tanned skin, net making, sewing reeds and working birch bark. The implementation of the experimental activity was also aimed at testing tool functionality in the course of the various tasks. The comparison between archaeological and experimental use-wear seems to indicate that the bone tool from GalgenbÃ¼hel was used as a needle for working vegetal material. On the other hand our experiments revealed a high functionality of this kind of tool also in beading fish heads, working tanned hide and bending birch bark...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} the New England Otter Trawl Fishery between 1982 and 1998 {{and the potential}} economic impacts of regulations on the Northeastern Multispecies Groundfish Fishery (MGF). ^ The study uses primary data collected by the author and secondary data obtained from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). This research required extensive econometric analysis of both value landed and cost data. The landed value {{is influenced by the}} vessel 2 ̆ 7 s physical characteristics, port of landing, seasonal choices of fishing gear-species combinations, days at sea and distance from shore, and the captain 2 ̆ 7 s skill (also referred to as the “skipper effect”). The vessel-cost model is composed of several equations, each corresponding to one of the following annual cost items: Trip Expenses - Other Variable Costs - Indivisible Operating Costs - 5 year Overhaul - Depreciation and Interests - Crew Benefits and Crew Bonuses. The estimated equations are used to synthesize an economic model of vessel behavior, which can be used to examine the economic consequences of alternative scenarios. ^ This model was used to examine the impacts of selected regulations on the fishing industry. The results indicate differential impacts, which affect larger vessels (especially above 90 feet). The statistics show that some vessels modify their fishing habits by re-targeting their catch to different species and/or by changing how far they are willing to go fishing. These changes affected essentially geographic and seasonal effort distribution for both large and small trawlers. Larger vessels are fishing more inshore than before and for less valuable species thus bringing more pressure on inshore fish stocks. The results also shed light on the relative efficiency of large and small vessels, although they suggest that the issue is ill phrased!—small (50 to 60 ft) vessels appear more efficient than larger vessels when both are operating near shore. However, smaller vessels are not sufficiently seaworthy to compete with larger (3 ̆e 80 ft) vessels in offshore environments. This finding is pertinent to concerns often expressed about the survival of small vessels under an individual transferable quota (ITQ) regime. ^ These results also confirm the findings by Griffith and Dyer (1996) who concluded that recent regulations especially affected communities relying on <b>specialized</b> <b>fishing</b> fleets with larger than average vessels. ^ Finally {{it was found that the}} method of data collection which started in 1994 (i. e. the use of the fishers logbook in lieu of the port agents and dealers 2 ̆ 7 data) was inadequate in capturing the value landed because it recorded landings at the docks before being priced by a dealer. As a consequence, the lack of systematic ex-vessel price data after 1993 required matching the logbook information with the already shrinking dealer information to estimate an ex-vessel price by species, month and port. This structural change in the data series confounds the effects of regulatory changes and stock declines. ...|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} and the theoretical literature both point to stock sustainability {{and the protection of}} marine biodiversity as important fisheries management issues. Decision-support tools are increasingly required to operationalize the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. These tools need to integrate (i) ecological and socio-economic drivers of changes in fisheries and ecosystems; (ii) complex dynamics; (iii) deal with various sources of uncertainty; and (iv) incorporate multiple, rather than single objectives. The stochastic co-viability approach addresses the trade-offs associated with balancing ecological, economic and social objectives throughout time, and takes into account the complexity and uncertainty of the dynamic interactions which characterize exploited ecosystems and biodiversity. This thesis proposes an application of this co-viability approach to the sustainable management of mixed fisheries, using two contrasting case studies: the French Bay of Biscay (BoB) demersal mixed fishery and the Australian Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF). Both fisheries entail direct and indirect impacts on mixed species communities while also generating large economic returns. Their sustainability is therefore a major societal concern. A dynamic bio-economic modelling approach is used to capture the key biological and economic processes governing these fisheries, combining age- (BoB) or size- (NPF) structured models of multiple species with recruitment uncertainty, and multiple fleets (BoB) or fishing strategies (NPF). Economic uncertainties relating to input and output prices are also considered. The bioeconomic models are used to investigate how the fisheries can operate within a set of constraints relating to the preservation of Spawning Stock Biomasses (BoB) or Spawning Stock Size Indices (NPF) of a set of key target species, maintenance of the economic profitability of various fleets (BoB) or the fishery as a whole (NPF), and limitation of fishing impacts on the broader biodiversity (NPF), under a range of alternative scenarios and management strategies. Results suggest that under a status quo strategy both fisheries can be considered as biologically sustainable, while socio-economically (and ecologically in the NPF case) at risk. Despite very different management contexts and objectives, viable management strategies suggest a {{reduction in the number of}} vessels in both cases. The BoB simulations allow comparison of the trade-offs associated with different allocations of this decrease across fleets. Notably, co-viability management strategies entail a more equitable allocation of effort reductions compared to strategies aiming at maximizing economic yield. In the NPF, species catch diversification strategies are shown to perform well in controlling the levels of economic risk, by contrast with more <b>specialized</b> <b>fishing</b> strategies. Furthermore analyses emphasize the importance to the fishing industry of balancing global economic performance with inter-annual economic variability. Promising future developments based on this research involve the incorporation of a broader set of objectives including social dimensions, as well as the integration of ecological interactions, to better address the needs of ecosystem-based approaches to the sustainable harvesting of marine biodiversity. L’objectif général de la thèse est de modéliser les principaux processus biologiques et économiques régissant des pêcheries multi-espèces et multi-flottilles afin de proposer des stratégies viables pour la gestion durable de ces pêcheries mixtes, dans un contexte stochastique et multiobjectif. Plus spécifiquement, cette thèse utilise des analyses de co-viabilité stochastique pour étudier les arbitrages entre des objectifs contradictoires de gestion (conservation, et viabilité économique et sociale) des pêcheries mixtes. Deux pêcheries mixtes sont analysées dans cette thèse : la pêcherie française mixte démersale du golfe de Gascogne et la pêcherie crevettière australienne du Nord (NPF). Ces deux pêcheries sont multi-espèces, et utilisent des stratégies multiples de pêche, induisant des impacts directs et indirects sur les écosystèmes. Cette thèse propose une application de la co-viabilité stochastique à ces deux cas, en prenant en compte leur histoire, leur contexte socio-politique et les différences dans les stratégies et objectifs de gestion. Les résultats suggèrent que le status quo peut être considéré comme une stratégie biologiquement durable mais socio économiquement à risque dans les deux pêcheries (ainsi qu’à risque écologique dans le cas de la pêcherie australienne). Les simulations réalisées pour le golfe de Gascogne permettent de comparer les arbitrages associés à différentes réductions de capacités par flottille et de montrer qu’il existe des solutions de gestion permettant la co-viabilité du système (viabilité biologique des différentes espèces considérées et viabilité socio-économique des flottilles) contrairement à des stratégies de gestion mono-spécifiques ou basées sur la maximisation de la rente. Dans la pêcherie crevettière australienne, l’analyse montre que les stratégies de diversification permettent de limiter le risque économique contrairement aux stratégies plus spécialisées...|$|E
40|$|Angling for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) is {{a popular}} {{recreational}} activity and provides income for Norwegian landowners holding fishing rights. Abundance and distribution of salmon have however declined markedly during the last 30 years. The recreational salmon fishery is a highly interesting meeting place for natural resources management, delegation of rights and responsibilities, and economic development in rural areas. Landowners are key actors in this regard by having {{a wide range of}} roles being farm owners, holders of fishing rights, suppliers of angling, tourist hosts, owners and managers of salmon habitat, and comanagers of salmon stocks through statuary river owner organizations. Landowners have limited angling tourism resources, and share salmon management responsibilities, making collective-action by the landowner group important. The recreational salmon fishery which both salmon and landowners are parts of {{can be viewed as a}} social-ecological system where there is reciprocity between salmon as a resource and landowners regarding angling tourism,management and conservation of salmon stocks. The main objectives of the thesis were 1) to identify constraints and 2) make recommendations about management of salmon stocks and development of angling tourism in Norway with an emphasis on private small scale landowners. Secondary objectives were to: a) reveal landowners’ objectives and which variables influence these objectives; b) analyze landowners’ profit efficiency; c) analyze risk sources in angling tourism and landowners’ risk management strategies; d) identify different types of landowners, their priority of management actions to strengthen salmon stocks and attitudes to river owner organizations’ work. The objectives were addressed through a study of the recreational salmon fishery in four major salmon rivers in the Trondheim fjord region of mid-Norway. Empirical results were based on a postal questionnaire survey sent landowners in the Gaula, Orkla, Stjørdal and Verdal rivers. Data analyses included use of multiple regressions, factor analysis, binary logistic regression, cluster analysis, and a stochastic profit frontier function. The study revealed a heterogeneous landowner group regarding quality of the fishing rights, farm and landowner characteristics, and objectives about the fishing right. Heterogeneity is generally a problem for cooperation and coordination. Several distinct landowner types were identified: the passive owner, the recreationist, the multiobjective owner, and the economist. Marginalization of angling income reduces profit efficiency in supply of angling tourism. The ongoing trend with more landowners taking off-farm work or not living on the farm may lead to future landowners emphasizing the recreational function of the fishing right and other farm resources rather than the business function. Thereby, profit efficiency would decrease and less fishing could be available for anglers and have consequences for rural tourism. Policies should therefore facilitate development of <b>specialized</b> <b>fishing</b> tourism enterprises by making it easier to rent and acquire fishing rights. Thus could be done by e. g. legislating a minimum period for lease of rights. Mandatory organization of landowners in river owner organizations and introducing a minimum size for beats could also reduce some of the problems caused by heterogeneity in the landowner group. Reduced angling season and changes in strength of salmon runs salmon were seen as having the largest impact on future income from salmon angling tourism. Measures to strengthen salmon stocks might therefore be the most important measure to promote angling tourism, as this ensures that angling can take place and reduces landowners’ investment risk. Landowners used a multiple of strategies to secure household income. Salmon related strategies were least important probably because of the overall limited profit from angling (average NOK 30, 000 per landowner), and the top risk sources being beyond individual landowner control. Reduce problems from salmon farming and stop the spread of the Gyrodactylus salaris (Malmberg) parasite were seen as the biggest threats to salmon stocks. The river owner organizations have little influence over unfavorable conditions in the ocean. Landowners could maximize natural smolt production in the rivers to mitigate these effects and show that they take their share of salmon conservation. Management of habitat and regulation of the fishery to ensure enough spawners are key issues. The high priority of stocking and low priority of catch and release show the apparently irrationality of landowners in prioritizing management actions to secure stocks. This demonstrates a need for knowledge building in the landowner group and for improved communication between scientists, government, river owner organizations and landowners about the effects of stocking and other management actions. The many landowners being negative to the net fishery lease might be due to a lack of information from the river owner organization but also the unfamiliarity with paying for conservation, a concept being new for landowners that historically may have taken salmon for granted. The results from this study might be useful also for understanding how landowners view other natural resources on their farm and the effects on resource management, conservation and economic development...|$|E
