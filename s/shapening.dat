40|$|The {{number and}} {{distribution}} of habitable planets in the Milky Way {{is one of the}} foremost problems of contemporary astrobiological research. We investigate the effects of applying general neocatastrophic paradigm to the evolution of the Galactic Habitable Zone. In this paper, we investigate the limits of simple, 1 -dimensional astrobiological models, and consider the role of regulation mechanisms in <b>shapening</b> the "astrobiological landscape". We show that the transition from predominantly gradualist to predominantly (neo) catastrophist history of our Galaxy leads to the build-up of large-scale correlations between habitable sites, offering possible keys to such important problems as Carter's "anthropic" argument and Fermi's paradox. In addition, we consider the possibilities for extending the present class of models into spatially realistic 3 -dimensional case via probabilistic cellular automata...|$|E
40|$|Factors of {{embryonic}} polarization in Clava multicornis and Obelia loveni and cellular mechanisms {{of growth and}} morphogenesis of vegetal generation mainly in Obelia loveni and Dynamena pumila were studied. Morphological axis of embryo {{was found to be}} not determined irreversibly up to morula stage. Unequal distribution of mitotic divisions was demonstrated to be a main cause of embryo elongation. No definite relations were registered between shape and/or growth rate of vegetal rudiments and the characteristics of proliferative processes. Using time-lapse methods, a pulsatory character of growth and <b>shapening</b> was revealed. Growth pulsations are underlined by periodical contractions-extensions of densely packed cells of ecto- and entoderm. Some modes of behaviour of a system, composed by contractile, densely packed cells, are formulated. A number of normal and experimentally modified morphogenetic processes in Hydrozoa may be regarded as direct consequences of the properties of such systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this study}} we give an a posteriori error {{analysis}} on the WENO schemes for the nonlinear scalar conservation laws. This analysis {{is based on the}} new concept of numerical smoothness, with some new error analysis mechanisms developed for the finite difference and finite volume discretizations. The local error estimate is of optimal order in space and time. The global error estimate grows linearly in time, because of the direct application of the L 1 contraction between entropy solutions in the error propagation analysis. As a beginning, we only deal with smooth solutions in this paper. Within the same error propagation framework, when we deal with piecewise smooth solutions later, we only need to work on estimating the local error where smoothness is lost. The smoothness indicators not only serve the purpose of local error estimation, but also serve as a monitor on both the possible numerical instability and the expected solution <b>shapening.</b> 1...|$|E

By all the dimensions, attemting to perform a challenging and specific transformation, this nation-state {{was a part of}} the world which was slipping through the World War and experiencing a great economic crisis at the same time. This study deals with the First Five-Year Industrial Plan (FFYIP) with its prepatory and implementary phases. FFYIP can be evaluated as for either as a plan emerged by the result of the compulsory conditions or as an enterprise consciously and voluntarily., Implemented between the years of 1934 – 1938 that had been <b>shapened</b> by the periodical influences, FFYIP is an important plan carrying the socio-political dimension. This plan had been a pioneering one on the road of Turkey‟s industrialization, development and construction of self-confidency. The Plan, which would have affect the following economic policy-making processes hadn‟t appeared in a short-term and it had been observed that the Plan had been effective on the previous experiment and knowledge. By this reason, the study begins with a brief deal on the pre-Republican period and pays attention to the Republican happenings, then. The specialist committees from the USSR and the USA had made observations about FFYIP in Turkey. The main axis of FFYIP had been <b>shapened</b> by the specialists on economics from the USSR and apart from the own resources, the Soviet and English aids had been the important material supports...|$|R

Further, God to Moses strongly affirms it, in that he commands, That for the firstborn, in whom the rest were included, an offering should be offered, by {{that they were a}} month old (Exo 13:13; 34:20). God seems therefore, by this word, to look back to the transgression of our first parents, by whom sin came into our natures; and by so doing he not only intimateth, yea, promiseth a pardon to personal miscarriages; but assureth us, That neither them, nor yet our inward pollutions, shall destroy us, because of the rest that he found before in Christ (Rom 5).|$|R

But when a creature pretending to reason could be capable of such enormities, he dreaded lest the corruption of that faculty might be worse than brutality itself.

50|$|Studies {{employing}} a plectin knockout mouse have {{shed light on}} the functions of plectin. Pups died 2-3 days after birth, and these mice exhibited marked skin abnormalities, including degeneration of keratinocytes. Skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues were also significantly affected. Cardiac intercalated discs were disintegrated and sarcomeres were irregularly <b>shapen,</b> and intracellular accumulation of aberrant isolated myofibrillar bundles and Z-disc components was also observed. Expression of vinculin in muscle cells was strikingly down-regulated. Through the use of gold-immunoelectron microscopy, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence experiments plectin has been found to associate with all three major components of the cytoskeleton. In muscle, plectin binds to the periphery of Z-discs, and along with the intermediate filament protein desmin, may form lateral linkages among neighboring Z-discs. This interaction between plectin and desmin intermediate filaments also appears to faclitate the close association of myofibrils and mitochondria, both at Z-discs and along the remainder the sarcomere. Plectin also functions to link cytoskeleton to intercellular junctions, such as desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, which link intermediate filament networks between cells. Plectin has been revealed to localize to the desmosomes and in vitro studies have shown that it can form bridges between the desmosome protein, desmoplakin and intermediate filaments. In hemidesmosomes plectin has been shown to interact with the integrin β4 subunits of the hemidesmosome plaque and function in a clamp-like manner to link the intermediate filament cytokeratin to the junction.|$|R

Meanwhile, though Aditi is a personage so floating and nebulous, she figures in fairly definite form in a certain myth. The Rig-Veda (x. 72, 8) tells us the tale of the birth of her sons, the Adityas. [...] "Eight sons were there of Aditi, born of her womb. To the gods went she with seven; Martanda threw she away." [...] The Satapatha Brahmana throws a good deal of light on her conduct. Aditi had eight sons; but there are only seven gods whom men call Adityas. The eighth she bore a shapeless lump, of the dimensions of a man, as broad as long, say some. The Adityas then trimmed this ugly duckling of the family into human shape, and an elephant sprang from the waste pieces which they threw away; therefore an elephant partakes of the nature of man.
