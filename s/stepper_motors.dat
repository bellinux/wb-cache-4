40|$|<b>Stepper</b> <b>motor</b> is an {{electromechanical}} actuator {{widely used}} as positioning device {{due to its}} small size, reliable and relatively low maintenance cost. Furthermore, the permanent-magnet <b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> gives better torque/weight ratio than the DC motor. However, the control problem of the <b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> is complex due to the nonlinearities, the load torque perturbation, and the parameter uncertainties.

As the TEM can operate over a wide range of magnifications, the stage must simultaneously be highly resistant to mechanical drift, with drift requirements as low as a few nm/minute while being able to move several μm/minute, with repositioning accuracy on the order of nanometers. Earlier designs of TEM accomplished this with a complex set of mechanical downgearing devices, allowing the operator to finely control the motion of the stage by several rotating rods.

As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it [...] "steps"—starts and then quickly stops again—from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time.|$|E
2500|$|The 1948 Citroen 2CV was {{launched}} in France with a manual headlamp leveling system, controlled by the driver with a knob through a mechanical rod linkage. This allowed the driver to adjust the vertical aim of the headlamps {{to compensate for the}} passenger and cargo load in the vehicle. In 1954, Cibié introduced an automatic headlamp leveling system linked to the vehicle's suspension system to keep the headlamps correctly aimed regardless of vehicle load, without driver intervention. The first vehicle to be so equipped was the Panhard Dyna Z. Beginning in the 1970s, Germany and some other European countries began requiring remote-control headlamp leveling systems that permit the driver to lower the lamps' aim by means of a dashboard control lever or knob if the rear of the vehicle is weighted down with passengers or cargo, which would tend to raise the lamps' aim angle and create glare. Such systems typically use <b>stepper</b> <b>motors</b> at the headlamp and a rotary switch on the dash marked [...] "0", [...] "1", [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] for different beam heights, [...] "0" [...] being the [...] "normal" [...] (and highest) position for when the car is lightly loaded.|$|E
