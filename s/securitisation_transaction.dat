The first chapter focuses on securitisation, with a particular focus on securitisation of SME loans. In doing so it evaluates the costs and benefits associated with securitisation, as well as securitised assets and the products of securitisation. The following part describes the mechanism of both a true sale and a synthetic securitisation.

40|$|M. Comm. The {{securitisation}} industry {{started in}} the early 1970 s in the United States when securities, backed by pools of home loans, were issued for the first time. During the 1980 s, securities supported by other types of financial assets such as auto loans and credit card receivables were issued. Since then, securitisation has expanded rapidly into many countries, including South Africa. The first <b>securitisation</b> <b>transaction</b> in South Africa was a securitisation of home loans in 1989, but very few securitisations came to the market after that. In December 2001 the South African Reserve Bank amended the securitisation regulations, which had been in existence since 1992. This created greater certainty for arrangers and investors, and from 2002, the South African securitisation market has grown quickly, driven by frequent securitisation issues by banks. Securitisation is attractive for banks, {{because it is an}} additional funding source and allows for the matching of the maturity of a bank’s assets and liabilities. Another reason for the attractiveness of securitisation for banks {{is that it is a}} mechanism for managing the regulatory capital that a bank is required to hold. In a <b>securitisation</b> <b>transaction,</b> a loan originator such as a bank sells loans on its balance sheet to an independent company, which issues asset-backed securities to fund the acquisition of loans. Provided the transaction complies with the securitisation regulations, the transaction will result in the bank having to hold less regulatory capital compared to a situation where it had not securitised the loans. This “regulatory capital arbitrage” has been a major factor in banks’ securitising loans. Regulatory capital arbitrage is possible because of the relatively simplistic manner in which the Basel I capital adequacy guidelines calculate the regulatory capital a bank is required to hold. Given the worldwide growth of the securitisation industry, regulators have become increasingly concerned that banks may not be holding adequate capital as a buffer for the economic risks to which banks are exposed. The Bank for International Settlements, through its Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, has therefore devised a new set of capital adequacy guidelines to replace the Basel I guidelines. The aim of the new Basel II framework is to achieve a greater alignment of regulatory capital with economic risks and to improve risk management practices in banks. Although the Basel Committee cannot enforce its recommendations, it is expected that most regulators throughout the world will adopt the Basel II framework. It is generally expected that the implementation of Basel II will have a substantial impact on banks’ securitisation activities, especially to the extent that securitisation has been used for regulatory capital arbitrage purposes...|$|E
40|$|Preface. Securitisation deals {{have come}} into focus during the recent years due to the {{challenges}} in their assessments and {{their role in the}} recent credit crises. These deals are created by the pooling of assets and the tranching of liabilities. The later are backed by the collateral pools. Tranching makes it possible to create liabilities of a variety of seniorities and risk-return profiles. The assessment of a securitisation deal is based on qualitative and quantitative assessments of the risks inherent in the transaction and how well the structure manages to mitigate these risks. Example of risks related to the performance of a transaction are credit risk, prepayment risk, market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk, operational risk and legal risk. In the light of the recent credit crisis, model risk and parameter uncertainty have come in focus. Model risk refers {{to the fact that the}} outcome of the assessment of a <b>securitisation</b> <b>transaction</b> can be influenced by the choice of the model used to derive defaults and prepayments. The uncertainties in the parameter values used as input to these models add to the uncertainty of the output of the assessment. The aim of this report is to give an overview of recent performed research on model risk and parameter sensitivity of asset backed securities ratings. The outline of the text is as follows. 3 In Chapter 1, an introduction to asset-backed securities (ABSs) is given. We describe, for example, key securitisation parties, structural characteristics and credit enhancements. The cashflow modelling of ABS deals can be divided into two parts: (1) the modelling of the cash collections from the asset pool and the distribution of these collections to the note holders, discussed in Chapter 2, and (2) the modelling of defaults and prepayments. Deterministic models to generate default and prepayment scenarios are presented in Chapter 3; a collection of stochastic models is presented in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, two of the major rating agencies quantitative methodologies for ABS rating are discussed. Next, the model risk in rating ABSs is discussed and we elaborate on the parameter sensitivity of ABS ratings. More precisely, in Chapter 6 we look at how the choice of default model influences the ratings of an ABS structure. We illustrate this using a two tranche ABS. Furthermore, we also investigate the influence of changing some of the input parameters one at a time. A more systematic parameter sensitivity analysis is presented in Chapter 7. In this chapter we introduce global sensitivity analysis techniques, which allow us to systematically analyse how the uncertainty in each input parameter’s value contributes to the uncertainty of the expected loss and the expected average life of the notes and hence the rating. The report concludes with an summary of the findings in Chapter 8...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Securitisation {{entails a}} process whereby an entity, {{known as an}} originator, {{packages}} its income producing assets, for example mortgage cash flow, and sells them to a bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle (“the SPV”) by converting these assets into liquid marketable securities. To complete the process of securitisation, the securities are sold to investors. This must be distinguished from where the originator merely transfers {{the risks associated with}} the assets, which process is known as “synthetic securitization”. The present discussion only considers traditional securitisation, where the assets are sold and transferred wholly to the SPV. It further only considers securitisation by banks or banking institutions. In recent years the practice of securitisation has come under the spotlight in South African courts. The legitimacy of the process has been questioned and the courts have been called upon to establish if the <b>securitisation</b> <b>transactions</b> are valid. <b>Securitisation</b> will be held to be invalid in South African law if the debtor would be burdened more than he would have been had the transaction not taken place or where securitisation would deprive the debtor of defences that he would have had against the originator. This discussion considers these two instances. It further considers the merits of the mentioned court challenges against the theoretical background provided of the legal transfer of assets by cession, which is employed when the assets are transferred from the originator to the SPV.

40|$|Since the {{political}} changes in Eastern Europe took place, banks {{in this region}} have experienced a significant reorganization in structure, core activities and business understanding. These changes {{have led to the}} development of banking entities which are flexible, open to the new banking perspectives and react promptly to market changes. However, extensively growing Central and Eastern European (“CEE”) markets require financial sources to meet the increasing demand for core banking intermediation. In order to maintain future growth banks will search for funding instruments which allow them to grow without having a balance sheet effect. In this respect structured finance (especially asset securitisation) may be a solution for these banks and also for other institutions looking for diversified funding sources or credit risk mitigants. It is expected that trend to use securitisation structures will gain on importance due to the decrease in the availability of core funding instrument which are currently deposits. CEE banks’ customers are becoming more aware of possibilities on how to allocate their capital efficiently therefore conventional banking and battle for traditional funding sources will become more expensive. Although, recent market turbulences have significantly reduced the demand for structured finance products in developed economies, the role of these instruments will not lose on importance in the future. The growing sophistication of CEE banking industry will force banks to create products which enable them to attract liquidity by more advanced means. Covered bonds, ECB repurchase agreements and privately placed <b>securitisation</b> <b>transactions</b> can give flexibility towards active balance sheet management in the times of significant liquidity problems.

40|$|In {{the first}} chapter we {{introduce}} securitisations and discuss {{the current state of}} structured finance in Europe; we also explore the main trends in securitisations and future prospects. Next, we provide a general introduction to the theoretical and empirical literature concerning securitisations and structured finance more generally: we discuss theoretical hypotheses concerning different rationales for structured credit and explore the empirical literature on the topic. In the second chapter, we look at financial contracts determining implicit boundaries of a firm. In the spirit of the incomplete contract theory, we analyse optimal allocations of control in financial contracts involving limits on managerial discretion and legal separation of assets. Our model explores the interplay between different groups of creditors and managers in a symmetric information environment. The results display optimality conditions for different contracts from asset-backed securities through project finance to debt with covenants vis-a-vis a standard debt contract. In the third chapter, we provide the first systematic testing of the theories of tranching. We find support for asymmetric information and market segmentation explanations for tranching and present evidence on how such different rationales influence the structuring process in practice. We also investigate the impact of tranching on the price of securities at the issue level. In the fourth chapter, we investigate determinants of launch spreads in <b>securitisation</b> <b>transactions.</b> First, we develop a reduced-form pricing model of tranches across different transaction types and test it. We document the importance of credit ratings for prices of structured securities. Next, we test for the effect of tranching on pricing of individual securities. Finally, we develop a simultaneous equations supply and demand model with endogenous structuring to further investigate the effects of structuring on prices at launch. In the fifth chapter, we investigate returns to equity around securitisation dates, and explore how different factors influence the size and the direction of the potential effects. We find significant, positive, and consistent abnormal returns to equity on the pricing date, over longer event windows, and over the period immediately prior to the issue date. We find support for the theory that equity holders in well-capitalised banks and firms with low gearing benefit from securitisations. Furthermore, we show that more developed securitisation markets, larger issuers, and banks in particular all benefit from securitisations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Securitisation {{has been}} viewed as a key bank funding, risk {{management}} and performance improvement tool {{over the last two}} decades. However, the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 has shown that engagement in securitisation might create significant financial problems for banks and consequently lead to widespread problems in the financial sector. This, therefore, has underlined the importance of understanding banks’ securitisation activities, the benefits and risks inherent, and the consequences for the financial system. This thesis comprises empirical research on the effects of securitisation on banks. The work is presented in three essays. The first essay investigates whether banks improve their performance through the use of the securitisation market by applying a propensity score matching approach. Specifically, we attempt to assess whether the access to the securitisation market led to lower cost of funding, less credit risk exposure, and higher profitability. Using US commercial bank data from 2001 to 2008, we first test these hypotheses using univariate analysis and find that securitising banks are, on average, more profitable institutions, with higher credit risk exposure, and higher cost of funding. However, the propensity score matching analysis does not provide evidence to suggest that securitisation had a significant impact upon bank performance. In other words, the analysis shows that securitisers would have had comparable cost of funding, credit risk, and profitability had they remained non-securitising. This evidence leads us to conclude that securitisation does not seem to outperform alternative funding, risk management, and profitability improvement techniques used by non-securitising banks that have ex-ante similar characteristics to those securitising. The second essay investigates the impact of securitisation on the credit-risk taking behaviour of banks. Using US bank holding company data from 2001 to 2007, we find that banks with a greater balance of outstanding securitised assets choose asset portfolios of lower credit risk. Examining securitisations by the type of underlying assets, we find that the negative relationship between outstanding securitisation and risk taking is primarily driven by securitisations of mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and other consumer loans. Securitisations of all other types of assets, on the other hand, seem to have no significant impact on bank credit-risk taking behaviour. We attribute these results to the recourse commonly provided in <b>securitisation</b> <b>transactions,</b> as it might alter the risk-taking appetite of the issuing banks across asset classes. Therefore, we conclude that the net impact of securitisation on the riskiness of issuing banks, and consequently on the soundness of the banking system, is ambiguous and will depend on the structure of transactions. In particular, it will depend on the relative magnitude of credit support provided by banks. The third essay examines the relationship between banks’ off-balance sheet securitisation structures and insolvency risk, with a particular focus on credit and liquidity support provided by these banks. Additionally, it examines the risk effect of credit-enhancing facilities and liquidity commitments provided by banks to securitisation structures of other institutions. Using US bank holding company data for the period from 2002 to 2007, we first find that credit enhancements provided by originating banks in their securitisation structures have a significant positive effect on insolvency risk of the banks. Second, examining credit enhancements by the form of underlying facility, we find that among credit-enhancing interest-only strips, subordinated securities, and standby letters of credit, the latter have the greatest positive association with bank insolvency risk. In contrast, liquidity provisions are found to have a significant risk-reducing effect. Finally, examining credit and liquidity support provided by banks to third-party securitisation structures, we find that credit enhancing third-party securitisations reduces insolvency risk of the banks, while liquidity provisions are found to be highly positively associated with their insolvency. Summarising the main findings, the first essay finds no evidence of significant causal effects of securitisation on performance of securitising banks. The second essay finds evidence to suggest that outstanding securitisation has a negative impact on the credit-risk taking behaviour of banks; while the third essay finds that the interests retained by banks in connection to securitised assets significantly increase their insolvency risk. This shows that the net risk transfer for originating banks through securitisation might be ambiguous; however banks do account for the retained exposure to the securitised assets reducing credit risk taking. Taken together, the evidence from the three studies suggests that banks predominantly use securitisation for financing purposes rather than as a risk management or performance improvement mechanism. This research contributes to {{a deeper understanding of the}} motives for and consequent implications of securitisation and provides valuable findings for the ongoing discussion of how to redesign the securitisation model and to reform the supervision and regulation of banks’ engagement in securitisation activities in response to the recent financial crisis.

40|$|Saudi Arabia {{is moving}} towards a "free market" economy. This policy shift is {{consistent}} with the prevailing developmental views of the major international financial and economic institutions and of the major industrialised nations (which will form a given assumption for this thesis). A companion policy assumption fostered today by the international financial institutions and major industrialised nations is that essential to a sound market economy is a viable rule-based legal infrastructure that incorporates a substantive and procedural "rule of law" orientation. The recent economic legal reforms being undertaken by Saudi Arabia involve both enhancements and modifications to the basic Islamic law framework required under the Saudi Constitution to help facilitate the growing domestic demands of the Saudi economy and society and the de facto introduction of "modern" Western-based practices, approaches and techniques respecting commercial and financial transactions. That would be more attractive to foreign investors and financiers. While such reforms should make a positive contribution {{to the development of the}} desired market-based system, the overall effectiveness of these new reforms, as argued in this volume, may be adversely impacted or impeded by the existing de facto duality created by these reforms. This existing de facto duality is exemplified by having Islamic law (i. e., Shari 'a) as the paramount and primary legal system and, within this overall system, the separate, enactment of other positive laws related to the commercial, banking and financial sectors (i. e., "a system within a system"). This thesis argues that this current Saudi notion of legal duality needs to be re- evaluated and an internal reconciliation needs to be effected to avoid any negative implications on the functionality of the financial system and on the effectiveness of financial transactions such as, merely by way of selective example used in this volume, <b>securitisations</b> and secured <b>transactions,</b> which are important elements in a "modern" market-based economy. To this effect, Saudi Arabia may consider the advisability of further dualising the Saudi financial system whereby the "Western - based" component of the Saudi financial system is not functioning within an Islamic Shari 'a system but alongside an Islamic financial system (i. e., a system alongside a system) as is the case in a successful emerging economy such as Malaysia.
