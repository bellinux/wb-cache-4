25|$|A {{number of}} reforms were also {{carried out to}} the armed forces, as characterised by a {{reduction}} in basic military training from 18 to 15 months, a reorganisation of education and training, and personnel and procurement procedures. Education for the troops was improved, a personnel reshuffle of top management in the Bundeswehr was carried out, academic education was mandated for officers beyond their basic military training, and a new recruiting policy for Bundeswehr personnel was introduced {{with the intention of}} building an army that reflected West Germany’s pluralistic society. Defense Minister Helmut Schmidt led the development of the first Joint <b>Service</b> <b>Regulation</b> ZDv 10/1 (Assistance for Innere Fuehrung, classified: restricted), which revitalized the concept of Innere Fuehrung while also affirming the value of the “citizen in uniform.” According to one study, {{as a result of this}} reform, “a strong civil mindset displaced the formerly dominant military mindset,” and forced the Bundeswehr’s elder generation to accept a new type of soldier envisioned by Schmidt. In addition, the Federal Cost of Moving Act increased the relocation allowance (with effect from 1 November 1973), with the basic allowances raised by DM 50 and DM 100 respectively, while extra allowances for families were raised to a uniform amount of 125 DM.|$|E

Garland wrote that the panel had erred in failing to [...] "weigh the public interest in protecting the reporter's sources against the private interest in compelling disclosure" [...] and that this [...] "undermined the Founders' intention to protect the press 'so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people.'" [...] In Initiative & Referendum Institute v.

2500|$|Justice White {{also makes}} mention of how {{important}} the O'Brien Test was in deciding this case. The O’Brien Test being a tool of the court established in United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968) that determines whether governmental regulation involving symbolic speech can be justified. The restrictions of time, place, and manner can be allowed if they are (a) narrowly tailored (b) serve a substantial governmental interest and (c) there are alternative channels to communicate the information."Contrary to {{the conclusion of the}} Court of Appeals, the foregoing analysis demonstrates that the Park <b>Service</b> <b>regulation</b> is sustainable under the four-factor standard of United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), for validating a regulation of expressive conduct, which, in the last analysis is little, if any, different from the standard applied to time, place, or manner restrictions. Justice White also makes clear that {{in the view of the}} majority the act of sleeping holds little value in being considered an act of expression. [...] "In the first place, we seriously doubt that the First Amendment requires the Park Service to permit a demonstration in Lafayette Park and the Mall involving a 24-hour vigil and the erection of tents to accommodate 150 people. Furthermore, although we have assumed for present purposes that the sleeping banned in this case would have an expressive element, it is evident that its major value to this demonstration would be facilitative" ...|$|E
