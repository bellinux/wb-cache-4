He served as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force from 1963 to 1968. He worked as an obstetrician-gynecologist from the 1960s to the 1980s. He became the first Representative in history to serve concurrently with a <b>son</b> <b>or</b> daughter in the Senate when his son, Rand Paul, was elected to the U.S. Senate from Kentucky in 2010.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Oxford, Hogg {{was sent}} to York to serve a legal apprenticeship. Timothy Shelley was furious when he learned of the expulsion, but John Hogg was not minded to {{discipline}} his <b>son</b> <b>or</b> to forbid him from associating with Percy Shelley. Prudentia Hogg, who was an Evangelical Christian, was shocked when she learned that her son was promoting atheism. She was further angered when she learned that her son had become a vegetarian, a decision that she attributed to Shelley's corrupting influence.|$|E
5|$|Oslac is said by the Historia Eliensis to {{have had}} a son named Thorth, that is, Thored. His {{successor}} was indeed a man named Thored, {{but it is not clear}} whether this was Thored Oslac's <b>son</b> <b>or</b> Thored son of Gunner; historians tend to favour the idea that Thored the successor was son of Gunner.|$|E
5|$|Rædwald's <b>son</b> (<b>or</b> stepson) Sigeberht renewed Christian rule in East Anglia after {{returning}} as a Christian from exile in Gaul (into which Rædwald had driven him). His assumption of power may have involved a military conquest. His reign {{was devoted to}} the conversion of his people, {{the establishment of the}} see of Dommoc as the bishopric of Felix of Burgundy, the creation of a school of letters, the endowment of a monastery for Fursey and the building of the first monastery of Beodricesworth (Bury St Edmunds), all accomplished within about four years.|$|E

5|$|The film also explores father-son relationships, {{not only}} between Michael Sullivan and his son, but between Sullivan and his boss, John Rooney, and between Rooney and Connor. Sullivan {{simultaneously}} idolizes and fears Rooney, and Sullivan's son {{feels the same}} about his own father. Rooney's son, Connor, has none of Sullivan's redeeming qualities, and Rooney is conflicted about whom to protect: his biological <b>son</b> <b>or</b> his surrogate son. Connor is jealous of his father's relationship with Sullivan, which fuels his actions, ultimately causing a domino effect that drives the film.|$|E
5|$|Tvrtko I left {{at least}} one son, Tvrtko II, whose {{legitimacy}} is debated, and who was a minor and apparently not considered fit to succeed his father. Dabiša, a relative (possibly illegitimate half-brother) exiled by Tvrtko I {{for his part in}} the 1366 rebellion and reconciled with him in 1390, was elected king instead. Ostoja, the next king, may have been Tvrtko I's illegitimate <b>son</b> (<b>or</b> more likely another illegitimate half-brother).|$|E
5|$|Women {{were usually}} {{identified}} as victims during the independence wars since {{the women of}} Latin America were forced to sacrifice for the cause. The ideals of womanhood meant that women must sacrifice what the situation required such as a mother sacrificing her <b>son</b> <b>or</b> a virgin knowing she might be sacrificing motherhood or marriage due {{to the loss of}} many young men. This view meant that women were meant to contribute to independence in a supportive role while leaving the combat and politics {{in the hands of the}} men.|$|E

5|$|Beyond {{the obvious}} honour, the award also carries a cash {{allowance}} for those under {{the rank of}} lieutenant (or the appropriate service equivalent), {{and in some cases}} a cash award. Upon the death of the recipient, the pension is transferred to the widow until her death or remarriage. In the case of a posthumous recipient who is a bachelor, the allowance is paid to his father or mother. In the case of the award being conferred posthumously on a widower, the allowance is to be paid to his <b>son</b> <b>or</b> unmarried daughter. A monthly stipend of 10,000 rupees is given the awardee. The award amount and pension benefits are exempted from income tax. In addition, different ministries under the Central Government have various awards for PVC winners.|$|E
5|$|By the 1030s Malcolm's sons, {{if he had}} any, were dead. The only {{evidence}} that {{he did have a}} <b>son</b> <b>or</b> sons is in Rodulfus Glaber's chronicle where Cnut is said to have stood as godfather to a son of Malcolm. His grandson Thorfinn would have been unlikely to be accepted as king by the Scots, and he chose the sons of his other daughter, Bethóc, who was married to Crínán, lay abbot of Dunkeld, and perhaps Mormaer of Atholl. It may be no more than coincidence, but in 1027 the Irish annals had reported the burning of Dunkeld, although no mention is made of the circumstances. Malcolm's chosen heir, and the first tánaise ríg certainly known in Scotland, was Duncan.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Phokas, the {{rebellion}} collapsed, and Xiphias was arrested and forced to become a monk. Released from the threat to his rear, Basil II swiftly and decisively defeated George I, and imposed his terms on him. The other supporters of the uprising were imprisoned and released in 1025, after {{the death of}} Basil II and the succession of his younger brother, Constantine VIII. In 1026, however, Constantine VIII accused the last surviving member of the once great family, Bardas Phokas (possibly a <b>son</b> <b>or</b> nephew of Nikephoros Barytrachelos), of plotting against the throne, and had him blinded.|$|E

5|$|In 1221, Jacques de Vitry, Bishop of Acre, {{returned}} from the disastrous Fifth Crusade with good news: King David of India, the <b>son</b> <b>or</b> grandson of Prester John, had mobilized his armies against the Saracens. He had already conquered Persia, then under the Khwarezmian Empire's control, and was moving on towards Baghdad as well. This descendant of the great king who had defeated the Seljuks in 1141 planned to reconquer and rebuild Jerusalem. Controversial Soviet historian and ethnologist Lev Gumilev speculated that the much reduced crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Levant resuscitated this legend {{in order to raise}} Christian hopes and to persuade European monarchs who had lost interest by that time in getting involved in costly crusades in a distant region that was far removed from their own states and affairs.|$|E
5|$|The {{aforesaid}} {{kings of}} Bǫglunga sǫgur most likely refer to Rǫgnvaldr and his son, Guðrøðr (died 1231), {{although it is}} not impossible that the king 'Rǫgnvaldr' in this source may instead refer to Ragnall, and that the king 'Guðrøðr' in it may actually refer to Rǫgnvaldr himself, since the latter's father was named Guðrøðr. Whatever the case, the events depicted in Bǫglunga sǫgur appear to show that, in the wake of destructive Norwegian activity in the Isles, which may have been some sort of officially sanctioned punishment from Scandinavia, Rǫgnvaldr and his <b>son</b> (<b>or</b> instead perhaps Ragnall and Rǫgnvaldr) travelled to Norway where they rendered homage to the Norwegian king, and made compensation for unpaid taxes.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{marked the}} end of Bryennios's revolt, {{although}} Nikephoros Basilakes gathered up much of Bryennios's defeated army and attempted to claim the throne for himself. He too was defeated by Alexios Komnenos, who then proceeded to expel the Pechenegs from Thrace. The elder Bryennios was blinded on Botaneiates's orders, but the emperor later took pity on him and restored him his titles and his fortune. After Alexios Komnenos seized the throne himself in 1081, Bryennios was further honoured with high dignities. He even held command during Alexios's campaigns against the Pechenegs, and defended Adrianople from a rebel attack in 1095. His <b>son</b> <b>or</b> grandson, Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger, was married to Alexios's daughter Anna Komnene. He became a prominent general of Alexios's reign, eventually raised to the rank of Caesar, and a historian.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{studies of}} the mummy were first thought to reveal {{a man in his}} 50s, but {{subsequent}} examinations have shown that he was instead likely to have been in his mid-30s when he died. The identity of this mummy (Cairo Museum catalog n° 61057) was called into question in 1980 by the published results of Dr. James Harris, a professor of orthodontics, and Egyptologist Edward Wente. Harris had been allowed to take x-rays of all of the supposed royal mummies at the Cairo Museum. While history records Ahmose I as being the <b>son</b> <b>or</b> possibly the grandson of Seqenenre Tao, the craniofacial morphology of the two mummies are quite different. It is also {{different from that of the}} female mummy identified as Ahmes-Nefertari, thought to be his sister. These inconsistencies, and the fact that this mummy was not posed with arms crossed over chest, as was the fashion of the period for male royal mummies, led them to conclude that this was likely not a royal mummy, leaving the identity of Ahmose I unknown.|$|E
5|$|Alucard {{appears in}} , {{a chapter of}} the Lords of Shadow reboot series. It is {{revealed}} that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, conceived before Gabriel {{was turned into a}} vampire and became the dark lord Dracula. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land. After infiltrating the castle, Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room, where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his <b>son,</b> <b>or</b> telling Dracula his name. Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort, in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.|$|E
