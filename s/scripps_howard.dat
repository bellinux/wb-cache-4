5|$|The {{media have}} been criticized for {{focusing}} more on the First Lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions. She said after the 2008 election that she would like to focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families. In 2008 U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and <b>Scripps</b> <b>Howard</b> columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance, and has stated that Obama is miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.|$|E
5|$|On Veterans Day from 2001–2004, the American Broadcasting Company aired {{the film}} uncut and with limited {{commercial}} interruption. The network airings {{were given a}} TV-MA rating, as the violent battle scenes and the profanity were left intact. The 2004 airing was marred by pre-emptions in many markets because of the language, in the backlash of Super Bowl XXXVIII's halftime show controversy. However, critics and veterans' {{groups such as the}} American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars assailed those stations and their owners, including Hearst-Argyle Television (owner of 12 ABC affiliates); <b>Scripps</b> <b>Howard</b> Broadcasting (owner of six); and Belo (owner of four) for putting profits ahead of programming and honoring those who gave their lives at wartime, saying the stations made more money running their own programming instead of being paid by the network to carry the film, especially during a sweeps period.|$|E

500|$|... "Black and Blue" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, with critics particularly {{praising the}} performance of Andre Braugher. David P. Kalat, author of Homicide: Life on the Street – The Unofficial Companion, praised the script of [...] "Black and Blue", writing: [...] "Yoshimura has written some of the series' most memorable installments, but the scene of Pembleton extracting a 'confession' from an innocent man {{is one of his}} greatest achievements." [...] Kalat also complimented the performance by Margulies, who he said [...] "exhibits the same charm and charisma that made her a star on ER". Kinney Littlefield of The Orange County Register praised Braugher, particularly during the [...] "excruciating" [...] interrogation scene, and wrote, [...] "Unbelievably, 'Black and Blue' didn't earn Braugher an Emmy nomination." [...] Greg Paeth of <b>Scripps</b> <b>Howard</b> News Service called it an [...] "exceptional cop drama" [...] and complimented the dramatic tension between Pembleton and Gee.

500|$|Five {{months after}} the episode aired, Bill Clinton, who served as {{president}} of the United States at the time, held the first ever White House conference on Mental Health. <b>Scripps</b> <b>Howard</b> News Service columnist Deroy Murdock mentioned the timeliness of the conference in connection with the episode as being an instance of The Simpsons [...] "clairvoyantly predict the news".

5000|$|Estlow {{began his}} career as a {{reporter}} with the Rocky Mountain News and worked his way up to Business Manager for the Rocky's owners, Scripps-Howard (formerly the E.W. Scripps Company), a position he held from 1971 to 1976. In 1976, Edward Estlow became the first CEO at Scripps-Howard who was not from the <b>Scripps</b> or <b>Howard</b> families. Estlow had become general business manager at Scripps-Howard in 1971. Under his leadership, the Scripps-Howard Company bought 90 percent of the Media Investment Company, so that employees could own shares in the diversified E.W. Scripps Company. Also under his leadership, Scripps oversaw several joint operating agreements, which Estlow viewed as [...] "a matter of circumstance" [...] related to declining profits in the newspaper industry. Estlow argued that newspapers with separate editorial staffs but shared advertising departments would benefit from raised advertising rates. Speaking of the 1978 joint operating agreement entered into by The Cincinnati Post and The Cincinnati Enquirer, Estlow noted, [...] "When a community is unwilling to support two newspaper plants, we take a hard look at the joint venture option," [...] a position that people at the Post and Enquirer argued was a better alternative than the closing of the Post altogether [...] Also while he was CEO, the company spun off UPI, which had been originally established by E.W. Scripps, selling it to Media News Corporation. He retired from Scripps in 1985.|$|R
500|$|... "Stop" [...] was {{generally}} well received by music critics. For Sylvia Patterson of the NME, {{the song is}} an [...] "obscenely catchy Motown swinger", she added that it is [...] "the proper pop genius destined to be number one until Japan falls into the sea". Rolling Stone magazine's David Wild called it [...] "a retro, Supremes-lite confection that's as undeniable as it is unoriginal." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly characterised it as a [...] "delicious re-creation of Motown-era bop packed with skipping-down-the-street good vibrations". Larry Flick of Billboard magazine said that it has [...] "a bouncy, Supremes-like retro vibe", and called its hook [...] "irresistible". Flick also praised the David Morales remix of the song, calling it [...] "a vibrant, time-sensitive disco ditty", while <b>Howard</b> <b>Scripps</b> from The Press of Atlantic City called it [...] "an obvious girl-group ditty", and added that it [...] "is another potential hit". Conversely, {{in a review of}} Spiceworld, Andy Gill of The Independent, called the album a [...] "perky but charmless parade of pop pastiches", and described [...] "Stop" [...] as a [...] "pseudo-Motown stomp".|$|R
500|$|Associated Press writer Scott Williams {{praised the}} series as unique: [...] "It had superb writing, a gifted cast that created complex, fully {{realized}} characters, a unique visual style, and stories of compelling power and intensity." [...] Knight Ridder Newspapers television writer Mike Duffy praised {{what he called}} the show's witty writing, stylish visuals and superb acting, and declared it the best police drama since Hill Street Blues. The <b>Scripps</b> <b>Howard</b> News Service called Homicide [...] "the best new drama of the season", and The Buffalo News writer Alan Pergament ranked it among the ten best television shows of 1993. Eric Kohanik of The Hamilton Spectator called it [...] "the best new series of the midseason", and praised it for not resorting to [...] "silly car chases [...] blazing guns". Not all reviews were positive. James Endrst, television columnist for The Hartford Courant, felt the series was over-hyped and said [...] "seen it, done it, been there before" [...] of the filming techniques otherwise being praised as cutting edge. In writing about [...] "Gone for Goode", Time reviewer Richard Zoglin praised the [...] "strong cast" [...] and said he appreciated the lack of violence, but said, [...] "the characters are too pat, their conflicts too predictable", particularly the rookie character Bayliss.|$|E
