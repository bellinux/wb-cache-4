50|$|Video {{memory was}} {{allocated}} from 0x7FFF downwards as necessary, from 1 KB (Teletext mode 7) to 20 KB (modes 0-2). With only 32 KB RAM available, the video memory could eat a very sizable amount of memory. <b>Shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> is a 20 KB block of RAM that sits {{outside of the}} real address space, accessed via operating system calls. When the framebuffer is running from <b>Shadow</b> <b>RAM,</b> the memory normally used for video is free for program use. <b>Shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> is activated by setting the most-significant bit of the memory mode number. For example, to use mode 1 with <b>shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> enabled, request mode 129 (128 + 1).|$|E
50|$|QEMM 7.0x loads {{itself to}} <b>shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> by default.|$|E
50|$|The 82C495XLC {{incorporated}} the additional memory controller and <b>shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> support.|$|E
5000|$|The {{screen memory}} {{occupies}} {{the space between}} $200 and $3FF. In addition to the standard 8 bits of screen RAM, there was an additional single bit <b>RAM</b> <b>shadowing</b> the $200 to $300 space. This was configured as a 9th bit write-only plane, and {{was used by the}} Microtan 65 for rudimentary, or [...] "chunky", graphics. Setting the 9th bit displayed a Minitel type block graphic.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an analysis to calculate the cumulative, effective atomic oxygen (AO) flux impinging on short-duration EVA tethers used to secure panel NOD 1 /C 2 - 02 and panel LAB/C 2 - 03. <b>Shadowing</b> from the <b>ram</b> reduces the AO flux on much of the Node 1 panel. On the Lab panel, the tethers are essentially in the ram flux. Table 1 summarizes the results of the analysis for Node 1 and the US Lab panels...|$|R
5000|$|This {{problem is}} solved for some {{registers}} by Operating System [...] "Shadow" [...] registers implemented in regular RAM that mirror {{the values of}} hardware registers. During the Vertical Blank the Operating System copies the <b>Shadow</b> registers in <b>RAM</b> for Write registers to the corresponding hardware register, and updates Shadow values for Read registers from the hardware accordingly. Therefore, writes to hardware registers which have corresponding shadow registers will be overwritten by {{the value of the}} Shadow registers during the next vertical blank.|$|R
5000|$|... 82C235 - Single Chip AT (SCAT) - Released in 1989, {{compatible}} with PC/AT. Supported LIM EMS 4.0, up to 16 MB memory and <b>Shadow</b> <b>RAM.</b>|$|E
50|$|Improved Pentium {{support with}} DigiSpeech Portable Sound {{parallel}} port sound card. QEMM 7.5 no longer loads itself to <b>shadow</b> <b>RAM.</b> Optimize now properly detects hardware on system with network card.|$|E
50|$|This {{version is}} for the BBC Model B+, {{essentially}} the same as MOS 1.20 except with the addition of support for the sideways and <b>shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> present on the B+.|$|E
5000|$|Bit 2: Set to 1 {{to enable}} fast, though less {{accurate}} Potentiometer scanning. Fast Pot scanning increments the counter on every cycle and returns a usable result within two scan lines. The Operating System uses the slow Pot Scanning which increments the counter once every 114 cycles (scan line) taking a frame (1/60th second) {{to produce a}} result. The OS reads the Pot values during the its Vertical Blank Interrupt (VBI) and copies the result to the potentiometer <b>Shadow</b> registers in <b>RAM.</b> It then resets POTGO for the next read during the next VBI.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> {{was fitted}} as {{standard}} on the [...] "Model B+" [...] BBC Micro and on the BBC Master series, but was an optional, third-party extra feature on the [...] "Model A" [...] and [...] "Model B" [...] BBC Micro systems.|$|E
50|$|By {{switching}} between {{main and}} shadow memory on alternate frames, double-buffered video could be used. Acorn provided a demonstration program in BASIC showing scrolling cloud animation {{with and without}} double buffering. The video game Firetrack would also use double buffering if <b>shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> was present.|$|E
5000|$|The memory {{interface}} of AMD K8 CPUs supports [...] "Extended fixed-range MTRR Type-Field Encodings" [...] {{which allows}} one to specify whether accesses to certain address ranges are executed by accessing RAM through the Direct Connect Architecture or by executing memory-mapped I/O. This allows, for example, <b>shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> to be implemented by copying ROM contents into RAM.|$|E
50|$|On the BBC Micro version, it {{automatically}} detects sideways RAM expansion if present, which allows more detailed graphics on the levels, without any {{changes to the}} underlying gameplay. Innovative use of colour makes the 8-colour palette of the BBC look much broader. The scrolling is smooth and flicker-free, and {{there is very little}} noticeable slowing, even when many enemies are displayed at once. If <b>shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> is present, the graphics are double buffered.|$|E
50|$|Among BBS {{software}} {{available in}} its day, Blue Board was notable {{in that it}} made creative use of the computer's limited RAM space, including the <b>shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> behind its ROMs, to store frequently-referenced data such as usernames, passwords, and message headers. This allowed the BBS to bypass the C-64's notoriously slow floppy disk system for many functions. The text of the message bases was kept on floppy disk in random access mode, bypassing the performance limitations of the 1541 floppy disk drive's file system. In addition, the entire BBS program was written in 6510 assembly code, further improving both speed and memory efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|Noisia have {{released}} music on major drum & bass labels such as TeeBee's Subtitles, Goldie's Metalheadz, Rob Playford's Moving <b>Shadow,</b> <b>RAM</b> Records, Virus Recordings, Hospital Records, and Renegade Hardware. The Dutch collective has also received extensive airplay on BBC Radio 1. Eventually Robbie Williams showed interest {{in working with}} Noisia, asking them to remix his cover of Manu Chao's [...] "Bongo Bong and Je Ne T'aime Plus", which they turned into a house track released on the major record label EMI. The Noisia remix of Moby's [...] "Alice" [...] has also been released to critical acclaim.|$|E
50|$|A {{development}} of the Turbo Board, the Master RAM Board duplicated the Turbo Board functionality and added a further option of running the micro with 32 kB of <b>shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> {{in addition to the}} ordinary 32 kB — giving 64 kB total. Some clever program counter catches meant that the ordinary system ROMs and any software using the OS calls could function without significant modification, making substantially more memory available for BASIC, View, Viewsheet and almost every other business application. By providing extra storage this modification also allowed some games and applications intended for the BBC Micro to function on the Electron despite the lack of a native Mode 7.|$|E
50|$|InterWord was a {{menu-driven}} WYSIWYG wordprocessor {{which allowed}} 80-column editing (screen modes 0 or 3, {{with the latter}} taking less screen memory but displaying fewer lines on the screen), {{as well as a}} non-standard 106-column view using custom fonts. 40- and 53-column views were also available if a larger font was required or to reduce screen memory footprint, and the display would scroll horizontally when narrower than the printed page. InterWord could not use the extra-low-memory teletext mode except for its main menu, and recommended that the machine have <b>Shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> (like the BBC Master) so that screen memory would not be an issue.|$|E
50|$|As {{a common}} example, the BIOS in typical {{personal}} computers often has an option called “use shadow BIOS” or similar. When enabled, functions relying {{on data from}} the BIOS’s ROM will instead use DRAM locations (most can also toggle shadowing of video card ROM or other ROM sections). Depending on the system, this may not result in increased performance, and may cause incompatibilities. For example, some hardware may be inaccessible to the operating system if <b>shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> is used. On some systems the benefit may be hypothetical because the BIOS is not used after booting in favor of direct hardware access. Free memory is reduced {{by the size of}} the shadowed ROMs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} Silicon Oxide Nitride Oxide Semiconductor (SONOS) {{nonvolatile memory}} development at Sandia National Laboratories. A 256 K EEPROM nonvolatile memory and a 2 K nonvolatile <b>shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> are under development using an n-channel SONOS memory technology. The technology has 1. 2 {micro}m minimum features in a twin well design using shallow trench isolation...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for injecting errors into a FDDI {{token ring}} network is disclosed. The error injection scheme operates by fooling a FORMAC into thinking it sent a real frame of data. This {{is done by}} using two RAM buffers. The RAM buffer normally accessed by the RBC/DPC becomes a <b>SHADOW</b> <b>RAM</b> during error injection operation. A dummy frame is loaded into the <b>shadow</b> <b>RAM</b> in order to fool the FORMAC. This data is just like the data {{that would be used}} if sending a normal frame, with the restriction that it must be shorter than the error injection data. The other buffer, the error injection RAM, contains the error injection frame. The error injection data is sent out to the media by switching a multiplexor. When the FORMAC is done transmitting the data, the multiplexor is switched back to the normal mode. Thus, the FORMAC is unaware of what happened and the token ring remains operational...|$|E
