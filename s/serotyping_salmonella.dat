A survey was attempted {{to verify the}} presence of these microorganisms in birds of prey (i. e. Accipitriformes, Falconiformes, Strigiformes) reared for falconry in Veneto region (Italy). Seventy-four individuals were tested for Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. Cloacal swabs were collected and analysed by microbiological procedures in order to identify the presence of the two bacteria. Multiplex PCR (Campylobacter spp.) and <b>serotyping</b> (<b>Salmonella</b> spp.) were used to identify isolates. Six C. jejuni and 1 S.

40|$|Serotyping is {{the most}} {{fundamental}} approach in epidemiological surveillance and outbreak investigations for Salmonella. Many multiplex PCR assays have been reported for <b>serotyping</b> <b>Salmonella</b> based on O and H antigens. The {{aim of this study}} was to apply and improve the approach in differentiation and <b>serotyping</b> <b>Salmonella</b> enterica strains by combination of sequential multiplex PCRs targeting the O, H and Vi antigens of Salmonella, and this achieved by working on 126 strains. All the strains were purified on BSA and produced black colonies of Salmonella. The strains were confirmed by PCR amplification gene that targets the hilA. 122 of 126 strains produced the expected band size of 789 bp. A multiplex PCR (MPCR) for serogrouping targets O and Vi antigens was applied on the 122 strains: 28. 7 % (C 2, n= 35), 27. 1 % (B, n= 33), 22. 9 % (D, n= 29), 17. 2 % (E, n= 21), 1. 64 % (C 1, n= 2), and 1. 64 % (A, n= 2). Eight of the Salmonella strains from group D have the Vi antigen. A multiplex PCR for serotyping targets H 1 antigens was applied on the tested strains, and were Ha, Hb, and Hd antigens detected in 19 of 122 strains. S. Paratyphi A and S. Typhi correctly are identified by MPCR for H 1 antigens. The percentage of the strains were produced flagella antigens (H 1; a, b, and d) was 18. 1 % while the percentage of non-expressed strains was 81. 9 %. Therefore, due to the limited information provided by H 1 MPCR assay, additional primers for flagella antigens (both H 1 and H 2) were used. The optimization was carried out on the new primers by adjusting the concentration of buffer, time and denaturation and annealing temperature. The optimized PCR for H serotyping detected the expected amplicons of H 1 and H 2 antigens and further confirmation was done by DNA sequencing. The overall of multiplex PCRs of O and H results correctly serotyped 94 of 122 strains (77 %). The most frequent serovars encountered were S. Weltevrerden, S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, S. Hadar and S. Typhi. Application of DNA based serogrouping and serotyping found to be robust, quick methods for differentiation of common Salmonella enterica...|$|E
40|$|Salmonella enterica {{is highly}} {{polymorphic}} for the O antigen, a surface polysaccharide that {{is subject to}} intense selection by the host immune system.

30|$|Flagella confer {{motility}} to Salmonella {{and have}} been employed {{as one of the}} main antigenic determinants used for <b>serotyping</b> <b>Salmonella</b> isolates. The external body of the flagellum is mainly constituted by an homopolymer of flagellin, organized in an helicoidal distribution, presenting an exposed central domain that is highly variable among the different serovars and conserved N and C-terminal regions that are responsible for the polymerization of flagellin to form the flagellum (Ramos et al. 2004). The variability of the central domain of flagellin is reflected in the high number of serovars described for the Salmonella genus. Traditionally, serotyping was conducted using polyclonal antisera that were generated by inoculation with the desired strain and adsorbed with a set of related strains to increase the specificity of the resulting antiserum (Gray et al. 1974). In the case of H antigen, preparation of specific antiserum was facilitated by the use of purified flagellin for immunization (Ibrahim et al. 1985 a), although the presence of conserved regions in the molecule among different serovars originated possible cross-reactions depending on the procedure used for antiserum generation (Ibrahim et al. 1985 b). Upon the widespread use of techniques for monoclonal antibody (MAb) generation, several MAbs for strain serotyping have been described (Sojka et al. 2001; de Vries et al. 1998; Rementeria et al. 2009; Iankov et al. 2002). The availability of strain-specific MAbs for serotyping provides many advantages, such as using a molecularly defined homogeneous reagent that can be produced in high scale and basically without restrictions of quantity (Nelson et al. 2000).|$|E

Seven EQAS iterations were conducted between 2000 and 2007. In each iteration, participating laboratories submitted serotyping results for eight Salmonella isolates. A total of 249 laboratories in 96 countries participated {{in at least one}} EQAS iteration. A total of 756 reports were received from the participating laboratories during the seven EQAS iterations. Cumulatively, 76 % of participating laboratories submitted data for all eight strains, and 82 % of strains were correctly serotyped. In each iteration, 84 % to 96 % of the laboratories correctly serotyped the Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis isolate that was included as an internal quality control strain. Regional differences in performance were observed, with laboratories in Central Asia and the Middle East performing less well overall than those in other regions. Errors that resulted in incorrect serovar identification were typically caused by difficulties in the detection of the phase two flagellar antigen or in differentiation within antigen complexes; some of these errors are likely related {{to the quality of the}} antisera available. The results from the WHO Global Salm-Surv EQAS, the largest of its kind in the world, show that most laboratories worldwide are capable of correctly <b>serotyping</b> <b>Salmonella</b> species.

40|$|The Kauffmann-White {{scheme for}} <b>serotyping</b> <b>Salmonella</b> recognizes 46 somatic (O) antigen groups, which {{together}} with detection of the flagellar (H) antigens {{form the basis}} for serotype identification. Although serotyping has become an invaluable typing method for epidemiological investigations of Salmonella, it does have some practical limitations. We have been characterizing the genes required for O and H antigen biosynthesis with the goal of developing a DNA-based system for the determination of serotype in Salmonella. The majority of the enzymes involved in O antigen biosynthesis are encoded by the rfb gene cluster. We report the sequencing of the rfb region from S. enterica serotype Sundsvall (serogroup O: 6, 14). The S. enterica serotype Sundsvall rfb region is 8. 4 kb in length and comprises six open reading frames. When compared with other previously characterized rfb regions, the serogroup O: 6, 14 sequence is most related to serogroup C 1. On the basis of DNA sequence similarity, we identified two genes from the mannose biosynthetic pathway, two mannosyl transferase genes, the O unit flippase gene and, possibly, the O antigen polymerase. The whole cluster is derived from a low-G+C-content organism. Comparative sequencing of an additional serogroup O: 6, 14 isolate (S. enterica serotype Carrau) revealed a highly homologous sequence, suggesting that O antigen factors O: 24 and O: 25 (additional O factors associated with serogroup O: 6, 14) are encoded outside the rfb gene cluster. We developed a serogroup O: 6, 14 -specific PCR assay based on a region of the putative wzx (O antigen flippase) gene.

40|$|Non-Typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) {{species are}} {{important}} food-borne pathogens. Although acute gastroenteritis {{is the most}} common clinical symptom, complications can occur resulting in bacteraemia with or without focal infections. Food products, especially food of animal origin such as poultry are associated with the transmission to humans. In Africa, NTS are among {{the most common cause of}} bloodstream infections in children younger than 5 years. Epidemiological data on NTS are lacking in Africa both for human and animal infections. Therefore, a study providing a better understanding of the factors that lead to the emergence of NTS is a prerequisite for the design of improved intervention strategies to control these pathogens. The aim of this thesis was to study the epidemiology of NTS pathogens in humans and animals in The Gambia and Senegal. Chapter 1 reviews the current status of knowledge on NTS infections in Africa with focus on The Gambia and Senegal. It also provides the background against which these studies were conducted. Chapter 2 describes the prevalence of NTS along the poultry production chain in Casamance, Senegal. Fifty seven randomly selected broiler farms, 42 street restaurants and 285 chicken carcasses were studied. The following farm prevalences were reported: 35. 1, 38. 6 and 29. 8 % in chicken faeces, on carcass skin, and in muscles, respectively. NTS were found in chicken meat servings of 14. 3 % of the 42 street restaurants and in 40. 4 % of the 285 chicken carcasses examined. The most prevalent serotypes among the eighteen identified were Salmonella Brancaster (57. 9 %), Salmonella Goelzau (10. 7 %), Salmonella Kentucky (8. 4 %), and Salmonella Hadar (7. 3 %). The following serotypes were for the first time identified in Senegal: Salmonella Bandia, Salmonella Bessi, Salmonella Brunei, Salmonella Hull, Salmonella Istanbul, Salmonella Javiana, Salmonella Magherafelt, Salmonella Molade, Salmonella oxford, Salmonella Poona, Salmonella Rubislaw, Salmonella Tamale, Salmonella Zanzibar and Salmonella Goelzau. The prevalence of NTS on skin and in muscle was significantly associated with the detection of Salmonella in feces (P≤ 0. 001). The high levels of contamination of skin and muscle can be attributed to poor hygiene at the farm level and the non-hygienic handling of chicken carcass meat during and after slaughtering. This conclusion is supported by the fact that some serotypes are present both on the farm (as found in feces) and in carcasses (on skin and meat). Food can also become contaminated through environmental contact, because hygienic measures applied in the restaurants are poor. A large proportion of our isolates (77. 7 %) were resistant to two or more antibiotics commonly used in Senegalese veterinary practices and in human medicine (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, trimethoprim, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and spectinomycin). The high prevalence of Salmonella in broilers in Casamance and the level of antibiotic resistance are of concern and constitute a real threat to public health. Chapter 3 reports on the molecular characterization of 261 NTS serotypes isolated in poultry and poultry products in Senegal using consecutively RAPD and MLST. These techniques have provided details on the genetic diversity among the serotypes. Twenty distinct profiles were generated by the RAPD assay, the latter corresponding to the eighteen strains obtained after <b>serotyping.</b> <b>Salmonella</b> Kentucky showed two distinct profiles; this distinction was later confirmed by MLST. The MLST assay revealed genetic diversity resulting in 19 clones of which 16 were new and have never been reported anywhere in the world. The three known clones, namely Salmonella Kentucky ST 198 previously reported in Senegal, Salmonella Agona ST 13 and Salmonella Istanbul ST 33 were isolated in many countries from both human and animal sources. This shows that these clones are geographically widely distributed and are circulating in a wide range of hosts. However, one new clone of multi-resistant Salmonella Kentucky was found. This study provided us with new insights into the genetic diversity on NTS in Senegal. Molecular tools remain essential to study the epidemiology of NTS by tracking the sources of infection and/or contamination. These same techniques were used to study the animal to human transmission in The Gambia in the next chapter. In chapter 4, eight diarrheic children with confirmed salmonellosis and 6 healthy carriers were traced back to their compounds and Salmonella identified from the domestic animals (poultry, sheep and goat) living in close contact in the same compound. The most common serotypes identified were Salmonella Colindale in humans (21. 42 %) and Salmonella Poona in animals (14. 28 %). Among the animals, poultry carried the highest proportion of Salmonella (66. 7 %). In fact, poultry are considered as the most common asymptomatic carriers of Salmonella. However, serotypes in humans were different from those in animals except in one case where Salmonella Moualine was simultaneously found in chicken and a diarrheic child but in different compounds. After proceeding MLST on all isolates, we found that those two Salmonella Moualine were distinct but genetically very close because they differed at only one locus sucA. The similarity matrix of the strains revealed close genetic relatedness among Salmonella serotypes. There was at least 80 % similarity and the majority varied between 98 % and 100 %. This showed the stability of Salmonella clones which are not subject to high genetic variability. There was therefore no indication of clonal groups which are adapted to a specific host because the genetic tree did reveal that all lineages contained isolates of mixed origin (human and animal). The association between salmonellosis and other diseases, most often malaria, in our study shows the role of opportunistic infections and malaria in NTS infections. Almost all serotypes were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. This is due to the fact that antibiotics are not yet commonly used by of the rural population in The Gambia for treatment of NTS infections as well in humans as in the animal production system. Our results do not support the hypothesis that humans and animals in close contact in the same household carry genotypically similar Salmonella serotypes. Nevertheless these findings have stirred up the problem of the transmission of NTS in Africa and have highlighted the poultry population as playing a pivotal role of healthy carriers in the epidemiology of NTS. Based on this study, we suggest other areas to be investigated such as the environment and human-to-human transmission. Little is known on the molecular epidemiology of NTS particularly with respect to their virulence genes. Therefore, to assess their occurrence and contribution to disease in humans and animals in The Gambia and Senegal, we screened all serotypes isolated from humans, animals and food in both countries (chapter 5). A total number of 185 NTS was tested by PCR for the presence of 12 virulence genes. Among these genes, 10 belong to the five described Salmonella Pathogenicity islands thought to be implicated in Salmonella pathogenesis; and the other two genes are carried by plasmids. All genes were present at a level of more than 70 % except sopE and pefA which were observed in 33 % and 44 % of the isolates, respectively. The most prevalent gene was invA (95. 5 %) which is an invasion gene conserved within the Salmonella genus. It has been widely used to diagnose Salmonella in humans and animals. However, the sopE gene associated with outbreaks in human and animals was present in all serotypes isolated in humans with diarrhoea except one. Interestingly, Salmonella Istanbul and Salmonella Javiana isolated from chicken serving restaurants carried all the virulence genes of the five pathogenicity islands. There was a significant association between some virulence genes (sopB, sopE and pipD) and resistance to certain antibiotics namely amoxicillin, ticarcillin, trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, trimethoprim, spectinomycin, streptomycin, sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin. This association shows that resistance might increase the virulence of NTS during infection. These findings showed that all strains of Salmonella isolated from humans and animals are potentially pathogenic. This is very worrying because the most virulent serotypes were also the most frequently detected in food and in animals, and caused diarrhoea in immuno-compromised children. Furthermore, virulence and resistance are intrinsically linked and the presence of the virulence genes sopB and pefA is likely to increase the resistance to a series of antibiotics (trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, trimethoprim and sulfonamides) ...|$|E

Subsequent laboratory and epidemiological investigations established that an outbreak of human disease caused by this organism was occurring across Canada and was associated with pet treats for dogs produced from processed pig ears. Laboratory investigations using phage typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) established that isolates of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> infantis from pig ear pet treats and humans exposed to pig ear pet treats comprised a well-defined subset of all isolates analysed. Of the 53 subtypes of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> infantis obtained {{around the time of}} the outbreak as defined by PFGE and phage typing, only 6 subtypes were associated with both human infection and isolation from pig ears. Together with information from epidemiological studies, these investigations established pig ear pet treats as the cause of the <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> infantis outbreak. The results are consistent with a model in which contaminated pig ear pet treats constitute a long-term, continuing vehicle for infection of the human population rather than causing temporally delimited point-source outbreaks. During the course of this outbreak, several other <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> were also isolated from pet treats, suggesting these products may be an important source of enteric infection in both humans and dogs. Though isolates of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> other than <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> infantis from pet treats were also subjected to PFGE and phage typing, no link with human disease could be definitively established, and the contribution of pig ear pet treats to human disease remains unclear.

40|$|One hundred fifty-three {{wild boars}} {{shot in the}} canton of Geneva, Switzerland, were studied for the {{occurrence}} of foodborne pathogens. Tonsils and fecal samples of the animals were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay, and cultural methods. The detection rate of Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, stx-positive Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes was 12 %, 35 %, 20 %, 9 %, and 17 %, respectively, when tonsil samples were studied. Only Y. enterocolitica (5 %) and L. monocytogenes (1 %) were detected in fecal samples. None of the samples was positive for Campylobacter spp. Females (71 %) and young animals (61 %) carried more frequently one or more pathogens than males (53 %) and older ones (44 %). In total, 8 Salmonella spp., 14 Y. enterocolitica, 4 Y. pseudotuberculosis, and 26 L. monocytogenes strains were further characterized. Most of the Salmonella spp. strains were of <b>serotype</b> <b>Salmonella</b> Enteritidis (75 %) followed by <b>serotypes</b> <b>Salmonella</b> Stourbridge (13 %) and Salmonella Veneziana (13 %). L. monocytogenes strains belonged to serotypes 1 / 2 a (42 %), 1 / 2 b (19 %), and 4 b (38 %).

40|$|Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) {{is a major}} {{virulence}} factor {{present in}} the outer membrane of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) from Salmonella show high immunogenicity and provide protection against Salmonella infection, and truncated LPS alters the outer membrane composition of the cell wall. In our previous study, we demonstrated that Salmonella mutants carrying truncated LPS failed to induce strong immune responses and cross-reaction to other enteric bacteria, due to their high attenuation and low colonization in the host. Therefore, we plan to investigate whether outer membrane proteins from Salmonella mutants with truncated LPS resulting {{from a series of}} nonpolar mutations, including ∆waaC 12, ∆waaF 15, ∆waaG 42, ∆rfaH 49, ∆waaI 43, ∆waaJ 44, ∆waaL 46, ∆wbaP 45 and ∆wzy- 48, affect immunogenicity and provide protection against diverse Salmonella challenge. In this study, the immunogenicity and cross-protection efficiency of purified OMPs from all mutants were investigated to explore a potential OMP vaccine to protect against homologous or heterologous <b>serotype</b> <b>Salmonella</b> challenge. The results demonstrated that OMPs from three Salmonella mutants (∆waaC 12, ∆waaJ 44 and ∆waaL 46) induced higher immune responses and provided good protection against homologous S. Typhimurium. The OMPs from these three mutants were also selected to determine the cross-protective efficacy against homologous and heterologous <b>serotype</b> <b>Salmonella.</b> Our results indicated that the mutant ∆waaC 12 can elicit higher cross-reactivity and can provide good protection against S.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of food-borne salmonellosis due to <b>Salmonella</b> enterica <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden {{is reported to}} be on the increase in Malaysia. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping method was used to assess the extent of genetic diversity and clonality of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden strains from humans and the environment. PFGE of XbaI-digested chromosomal DNA from 95 strains of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden gave 39 distinct profiles {{with a wide range of}} Dice coefficients (0. 27 to 1. 00), indicating that PFGE is very discriminative and that multiple clones of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden exist among clinical and environmental isolates. Strains of one dominant pulsotype (pulsotype X 1 /X 2) appeared to be endemic in this region, as they were consistently recovered from humans with salmonellosis between 1996 and 2001 and from raw vegetables. In addition, the sharing of similar PFGE profiles among isolates from humans, vegetables, and beef provides indirect evidence of the possible transmission of salmonellosis from contaminated raw vegetables and meat to humans. Furthermore, the recurrence of PFGE profile X 21 among isolates found in samples of vegetables from one wet market indicated the persistence of this clone. The environment in the wet markets may represent a major source of cross-contamination of vegetables with <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden. Antibiotic sensitivity tests showed that the clinical isolates of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden remained drug sensitive but that the vegetable isolates were resistant to at least two antibiotics.

40|$|The stationary-phase-inducible sigma factor, σS (RpoS), is {{the master}} {{regulator}} of the general stress response in Salmonella and is required for virulence in mice. rpoS mutants can frequently be isolated from highly passaged laboratory strains of Salmonella. We examined the rpoS status of 116 human clinical isolates of Salmonella, including 41 <b>Salmonella</b> enterica <b>serotype</b> Typhi strains isolated from blood, 38 S. enterica serotype Typhimurium strains isolated from blood, and 37 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium strains isolated from feces. We examined the abilities of these strains to produce the σS protein, to express RpoS-dependent catalase activity, and to resist to oxidative stress in the stationary phase of growth. We also carried out complementation experiments with a cloned wild-type rpoS gene. Our results showed that 15 of the 41 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhi isolates were defective in RpoS. We sequenced the rpoS allele of 12 strains. This led to identification of small insertions, deletions, and point mutations resulting in premature stop codons or affecting regions 1 and 2 of σS, showing that the rpoS mutations are not clonal. Thus, mutant rpoS alleles {{can be found in}} freshly isolated clinical strains of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhi, and they may affect virulence properties. Interestingly however, no rpoS mutants were found among the 75 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium isolates. Strains that differed in catalase activity and resistance to hydrogen peroxide were found, but the differences were not linked to the rpoS status. This suggests that <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium rpoS mutants are counterselected because rpoS plays a role in the pathogenesis of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium in humans or in the transmission cycle of the disease...|$|R

In addition to sef, fim, saf, and tcf, which had been described previously in serotype Typhi, we identified eight new putative chaperone-usher-dependent fimbrial operons, which were termed bcf, sta, stb, ste, std, stc, stg, and sth. Hybridization analysis performed with 16 strains of Salmonella reference collection C and 22 strains of Salmonella reference collection B showed that all eight putative fimbrial operons of serotype Typhi were also present in a number of nontyphoidal <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes.</b> Thus, a simple correlation between host range and the presence of a single fimbrial operon seems at present unlikely.

Therefore rapid, sensitive and cost efficient detection of Salmonella spp. is indispensable within microbiology labs. To amalgamate single tube isolate identification with Salmonella typing, we developed the high-throughput Universal Probe <b>Salmonella</b> <b>Serotyping</b> (UPSS) technique based on nano liter PCR. In comparison to the classical approach, where O- and H-antisera are applied, the UPSS relies on specific gene content amplification of Salmonella spp. by a universal TaqMan assay for all markers and identification of the specific amplicon pattern. To enable high-throughput technology we employed a chip format containing 1024 wells loaded by an automated liquid-handling system which allowed us to perform TaqMan PCR reactions in volumes of 100 nL per well.
