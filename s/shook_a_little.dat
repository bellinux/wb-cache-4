60|$|This {{reassured}} Bostil, and {{he resumed}} his chair. But his hand <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|E
60|$|Arnold {{found it}} quite {{impossible}} to answer her lightly. The fingers, indeed, which held {{the receiver to}} his ear, were <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{can tell}} you something,' said the lady, 'Riza <b>shakes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> He is too fond of first-fruits. His {{nomination}} will not be popular.' ...|$|R
60|$|The amazed Martha {{could only}} chafe the hands, and note sorrowfully the frightful {{changes in the}} face of her friend. The weirdly calm, slow voice began to <b>shake</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|Stephen {{took up the}} Standard. In {{spite of}} his self-control, his hand <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|E
60|$|Again the {{tell-tale}} color {{flickered in}} her face; then it vanished, {{and her voice}} <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|E
60|$|Alfreton's eyes glistened, and {{his hand}} <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> as he touched the rim of Winston's goblet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't quite know--to-morrow, perhaps. I wonder, Belle," [...] he went on, {{his voice}} <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> [...] "if {{you will always}} think as badly of me as you do now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you want}} to be very careful," [...] remarked Codfish, his voice <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> [...] "The ink will be sure to spoil some things, not to mention the bad tomatoes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sidney {{is still}} unconscious," [...] she announced, her voice <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> [...] "The doctors seem hopeful--but oh! Sir Henry, it is terrible {{to see him}} lying there just {{as though he were}} dead!" ...|$|R
60|$|Tuppence {{pulled herself}} {{together}} with an effort. Her voice <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> but she spoke out bravely.|$|E

60|$|They now unfastened Ravonino {{from the}} pole, and found, to their great joy, {{that he was}} yet alive, though {{considerably}} <b>shaken.</b> <b>A</b> <b>little</b> rice-soup, however, and a night's rest, put him all right again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Brimstone and gall,' thundered Hook, 'what cozening is here?' His {{face had}} gone black with rage, {{but he saw}} that they {{believed}} their words, and he was startled. 'Lads,' he said, <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> 'I gave no such order.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do as I tell you," [...] he ordered. [...] "If there's one of {{you here}} opens his lips about this, he leaves my service to-morrow. Not a dollar of pension, mind," [...] he added, his voice <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|Something of her mistress's {{agitation}} {{seemed to}} have become communicated to Lenora. Her voice <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> as {{she stepped into the}} elevator.|$|E
60|$|Winston turned, and {{a curious}} smile crept {{into his face}} as he laid a lean hand that <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> on the toilet table.|$|E
6000|$|Anderson {{turned away}} {{a little and}} ran {{his hand over the}} papers on his desk. Did she only imagine that his hand <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|It was unaccountable, but {{he almost}} fancied {{that he saw}} this new thing pass from her face, leaving her pale and tremulous. She looked away again and busied herself with the tea-caddy, but the fingers which held the spoon were <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|He put {{his hand}} up and brushed at an {{imaginary}} something before his eyes. Then he loomed over her, and that hand, now <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> reached out for her veil. Before he could touch it, however, she swept it back, revealing her face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Brimstone and gall," [...] thundered Hook, [...] "what cozening [cheating] {{is going}} on here!"

60|$|Her {{eyes were}} soft {{and her voice}} <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> as she leaned towards him. Something in his {{helplessness}} had kindled the protective spirit in her.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Flint {{went to the}} lamp, {{unrolled}} {{the ball}} of telegrams, seized one and crossed the room quickly, {{and held it out}} to her. His hand <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{reached and}} <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> iron bell. In shuffled a small Negro girl about twelve, barefoot, not very tidy, glowering {{at me with}} thumb in mouth and bulging eyes.|$|E
60|$|He {{stretched}} his arms out, glanced at them, <b>shook</b> them <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{had already}} written out Ruth's history," [...] Arnold said, his voice <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> [...] "He had written {{it out in}} pencil {{on a couple of}} sheets of foolscap. He gave them to me to bring away with me. I read them coming up. I am here now to repeat their purport to you." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went downstairs}} again {{to put out}} the lights in the dining-room. I noticed as I passed the {{sideboard}} that I was still <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> So I took a small drink of whisky--though as a rule I never care to take more than one drink--unless when I am sitting talking as we are here.|$|R
6000|$|Appleby made a last effort, but {{his voice}} <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> as he said, “This is not your business, Harper. You can’t do {{anything}} for me. Don’t be a fool!” ...|$|E
60|$|Ennison's voice <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> They {{were his}} friends, and they {{recognized}} his unusual earnestness. Drummond, {{who had been}} about to speak, refrained. Cheveney walked away with a shrug of the shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, Jane, I {{always knew}} we'd {{get a look}} at them hosses again--I shore knew," [...] Lassiter was saying in the same old, cool, {{careless}} drawl. But his clawlike hands <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|E
60|$|At {{the words}} her graceful shape was <b>shaken</b> with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gust of silent laughter.|$|R
60|$|The German lifted two heavy fists {{to heaven}} and <b>shook</b> them <b>a</b> <b>little</b> without <b>a</b> word.|$|R
60|$|He relapsed into silence, and {{continued}} to gaze at the opposite wall just above the bowed and sombre head of the woman. They saw plainly the family likeness that had haunted them in the dead man. Then his old shoulders began to heave and <b>shake</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> {{as if he were}} choking, but his face did not alter.|$|R
