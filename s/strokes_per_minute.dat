25|$|A forging press, {{often just}} called a press, {{is used for}} press forging. There are two main types: {{mechanical}} and hydraulic presses. Mechanical presses function by using cams, cranks and/or toggles to produce a preset (a predetermined force at a certain location in the stroke) and reproducible stroke. Due {{to the nature of}} this type of system, different forces are available at different stroke positions. Mechanical presses are faster than their hydraulic counterparts (up to 50 <b>strokes</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute).</b> Their capacities range from 3 to 160 MN (300 to 18,000 short tons-force). Hydraulic presses use fluid pressure and a piston to generate force. The advantages of a hydraulic press over a mechanical press are its flexibility and greater capacity. The disadvantages include a slower, larger, and costlier machine to operate.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} meant to acquaint the sheet metal worker with the {{numerous}} possibilities that stretch forming offers as an economical supplementary and alternative process as compared to deep drawing. A number of cost saving effects {{can be achieved by}} suitably designed multi-purpose tooling. In addition to the higher precision of the shape and the higher stability of stretch formed components it is above all the saving in sheet material for the component, the simpler tool design and the lesser expenditure for test runs that help reduce production costs. Modern stretch forming technologies do not need separate (mostly hydraulic) clamping devices so that the process can be used on widely varying types of presses. It is also suitable, as will be illustrated by the solutions discussed, for use on multi-station presses and press lines.

40|$|When {{skeletal}} muscle is inadequately stimulated for cardiac assistance, {{the result is}} often a loss of muscular function accompanied by atrophy, fatty degeneration and fibrosis. It was consequently of interest to find the stimulation patterns required to train {{skeletal muscle}} ventricles against a load in order to minimise damage and failure.

40|$|A {{modified}} rinsing {{method for}} the in situ technique {{was developed to}} separate, isolate and characterise the soluble (S), the insoluble washout (W–S) and the non-washout fractions (D 1 U) within one procedure. For non-incubated bags (t 50 h), this method was compared with the conventional, Combined Fractionation (CF) method that measures the D 1 U and S fractions in separate steps and subsequently calculates the W–S fraction. The modified method was based on rinsing of nylon bags in a closed vessel containing a buffer solution (pH 6. 2) during 1 h, where shaking speeds of 40, 100, and 160 <b>strokes</b> <b>per</b> <b>minutes</b> (spm) were evaluated, and tested for six feed ingredients (faba beans, maize, oats, peas, soya beans and wheat) and four forages (two ryegrass silages and two maize silages). The average recoveries as {{the sum of all}} fractions were 0. 97260. 041 for N and 0. 99060. 050 for starch (mean 6 s. d.). The mean W–S fraction increased with increasing shaking speed and varied between 0. 017 (N) and 0. 083 (starch) at 40 spm and 0. 078 (N) and 0. 303 (starch) at 160 spm, respectively. For ryegrass silages, the W–S fraction was absent at all shaking speeds, but was present in the CF method. The modified method, in particular at 40 and 100 spm, reduced the loss of small particles during rinsing, resulting in lower W–S and higher D 1 U fractions for N and starch compared with the CF method. For soya beans and ryegrass silage, the modified method reduced the S fraction of N compared with the CF method. The results obtained at 160 spm showed the best comparison with those from the CF method. The W–S fraction of the feedstuff obtained at 160 spm contained mainly particles smaller than 40 mm (0. 90860. 086). In most feedstuff, starch was the most abundant chemical component in the W–S fraction and its content (726675 g/kg DM) was higher than in the D 1 U fraction (4056177 g/kg DM). Alkaline-soluble proteins were the dominant N-containing components in the W–S fraction of dry feed ingredients and its relative content (0. 7960. 18 of total N in W–S) was higher than in the D 1 U fraction (0. 5960. 07 of total N in D 1 U) for all feedstuff except maize.

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this study}} is to report on the use of {{cervical}} stimulation as monotherapy to reduce swelling and normalize the size of limbs in two children with lymphedema of all four extremities. Case Presentation. One child also had hemifacial edema. In both cases, the mothers were trained to perform cervical stimulation under professional supervision. The cases of two girls, one of eight months and the other of six months, with primary congenital lymphedema are described. Outcome. After clinical diagnosis, the patients started treatment with cervical stimulation three times per week. The mothers were trained in cervical stimulation and, when the therapy team was confident about the mothers’ ability to perform the technique, the children began to be treated at home. The Godoy & Godoy cervical stimulation technique consists of around 20 to 30 light <b>stroking</b> movements <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> in the cervical region which stimulate the lymphatics. Perimetric measurements were made of the feet, legs, and the hands. Only two points (3 and 6 [*]cm) along the dorsum of the feet and hands and points at 5 [*]cm intervals up the legs starting at the ankle were considered. Today, the children are 5 and 6 years of age, without edema and with a normal life, without limitations, except with respect to precautions against injuries to the limbs and against infections particularly erysipelas. Conclusion. Cervical Lymphatic Therapy as monotherapy is an option in the treatment of primary congenital lymphedema...|$|R
