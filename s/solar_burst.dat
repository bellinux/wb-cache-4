A pair of unusually large solar flares early March 7, 2012 generated a Coronal Mass Ejection that was expected to reach Earth around midday March 8. In this case we focused on the second explosion of solar flare. It is found that the indication of signal potentially drives Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a series of}} studies investigating <b>solar</b> radio <b>burst</b> effects on Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers along with supporting instrumentation and analysis techniques. <b>Solar</b> radio <b>bursts</b> are a space weather phenomenon with its origins at the sun. Although <b>solar</b> radio <b>bursts</b> have been widely studied since the 1960 s and have been known to cause notable problems for radio communication systems such as cell phone networks (Lanzerotti et al., 1999) their impact on GPS was underestimated and largely ignored by the community. Recent large <b>solar</b> radio <b>burst</b> events in conjunction with accurate carrier-to-noise measurements from GPS receivers has allowed for the first precise qualitative and quantitative analysis of their impact. To the receiver, a <b>solar</b> radio <b>burst</b> is a wide-band radio interference source that causes an effective decrease in the received carrier-to-noise ratio. The analysis of moderate events on 7 September 2005 allowed for the prediction that larger <b>solar</b> radio <b>bursts</b> would present a significant challenge to GPS availability as soon as the next solar maximum in 2011 - 2012 (Cerruti et al., 2006). The future came sooner than expected when the record setting <b>solar</b> radio <b>burst</b> of 6 December 2006 caused wide-spread outages of GPS receivers. The event exceeded 1, 000, 000 SFU, was about ten times larger than any previously reported event, and was all the more surprising since the <b>solar</b> radio <b>bursts</b> occurred near <b>solar</b> minimum. These events had a drastic impact on several critical GPS systems utilized by the scientific community, the Federal Aviation Administration, oil-rig operations, orbiting satellites, and surveying. The size of the December 2006 bursts strongly suggests that the historical record may be inaccurate and raises the possibility for even more intense <b>solar</b> radio <b>bursts</b> during the next solar maximum that will significantly impact the operation of GPS receivers.

The value of frequency drift was used as the main idea in this auto classify algorithm because it can easily implemented using MATLAB.

Auto calculation of frequency drift burst on spectra was obtained from two parts which are frequency axis (df) and time axis (dt). The results of the frequency drift implementation in classification algorithm show that the algorithm developed gave almost similar determination as in manual detection.

We choose an intriguing type II radio burst with a velocity of 1193 kms- 1 that occurred on 2012 November 13 at 2 : 04 : 20 UT. In this case, the study of solar radio burst type III is of paramount importance {{because of the fact that}} it helps to gain an insight of generation mechanisms of solar flare and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) phenomena. Here, we have got a reasonably clear idea of the various forms under which the type III continuum emission may appear and potentially form a type II burst.

This phenomenon is very interesting to be tackled and study. How the burst suddenly broken is still ongoing research seems the event is very rare and hard to be proved.

Pre- and post-flare phases have a minimum time scale of 256 ms and a maximum between 1 to 8 s.
