She once stated to an interviewer that {{she would like to}} become a doctor, though later her father encouraged her to become a politician instead. Ziauddin referred to his daughter as <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> special, allowing her to stay up at night and talk about politics after her two brothers had been sent to bed.|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetry}} {{on earth}} mirrors the symmetric perfection of heaven. The purpose {{of art at}} this time—in architecture, the visual arts, and music—was not to create <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> new, but to reflect this divine perfection, {{and in this way}} to praise God. We find such a symmetric outline in many pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach,19 but only in a few cases is this outline as consequent as in the B Minor Mass. The parts Kyrie, Gloria and Credo are all designed with choral sections as the outer movements, framing an intimate center of theological significance.|$|E

25|$|The {{first edition}} of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, {{published}} in 1822, consisted of 200 copies only. Those were not sold, however, but {{at the expense of}} Halbertsma presented to acquaintances of his all over Friesland. In that way he awoke among his public a desire for more reading-matter of this nature. These stories and poems were in fact <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> different from what the readers were used to, not only as to what language they were witten in, but also and especially concerning their informal style. The copies of the booklet often were shared around through entire networks of family and friends, and not seldom the stories and poems were transcribed by hand before the booklet was given back or passed on.|$|E
25|$|However, the Meditator {{realizes that}} he is often {{convinced}} when he is dreaming that he is sensing real objects. He feels certain that he is awake and sitting by the fire, but reflects that often he has dreamed this very sort of thing and been wholly convinced by it. Though his present sensations may be dream images, he suggests that even dream images are drawn from waking experience, much like paintings in that respect. Even when a painter creates an imaginary creature, like a mermaid, the composite parts are drawn from real things—women and fish, {{in the case of}} a mermaid. And even when a painter creates <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> new, at least the colors in the painting are drawn from real experience. Thus, the Meditator concludes, though he can doubt composite things, he cannot doubt the simple and universal parts from which they are constructed like shape, quantity, size, time, etc. While we can doubt studies based on composite things, like medicine, astronomy, or physics, he concludes that we cannot doubt studies based on simple things, like arithmetic and geometry.|$|E

500|$|The iceberg {{theory has}} been termed the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway {{believed}} a writer could convey an object or concept while writing about <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> different. In [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] he elaborates on the mundane activities Nick carries out. The story is filled with seemingly trivial detail: Nick gathers grasshoppers, brews coffee, catches and loses a large trout. In this climactic event, however, the excitement and tension becomes so strong that Nick betrays his inner thoughts and he takes a break.|$|E
500|$|Scientology {{accounts}} {{say that}} he [...] "studied nuclear physics at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., before he started his studies about the mind, spirit and life" [...] and Hubbard himself stated that he [...] "set out to find out from nuclear physics {{a knowledge of the}} physical universe, <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> lacking in Asian philosophy".

500|$|Overall, reviewers saw Flow {{as being}} more akin to an art piece than a game. Navarro called it an [...] "arty piece of gaming", and complimentarily said that it had the [...] "vibe of an art-school project". Leadbetter {{believed}} that it was more of an experiment than a traditional game, and described it as a [...] "trippy ornament". Freeman called it the PlayStation 3's [...] "first art-house title". Roper summarized Flow as [...] "not so much a game as it is an experience", and Mitchell claimed that it [...] "tries to do <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> unique and experimental, and on that level, it succeeds".|$|E

500|$|McCartney's bass, {{placed in}} front of the mix, is an ingenious {{counterpoint}} that takes him all over the fretboard ... At the chorus, for example, while Lennon and McCartney harmonize in fourths on a melody with a slightly Middle Eastern tinge, McCartney first points up the song's droning character by hammering on a high G (approached with a quick slide from the F natural just below it), playing it steadily on the beat for twenty successive beats. [...] The next time the chorus comes around, though, he plays <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> different, a slightly syncopated descending three-note pattern that almost seems to evoke the falling rain.|$|E
500|$|That {{is not to}} say his operas did {{not come}} as great innovations. What sounds to a modern {{listener}} as derivative of the bel canto, his first major success, Nabucco, came as a <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> new. Never before had opera been so harmonically complex and direct. No longer was there the empty vocal display of the bel canto period composers. Granted, there is a significant amount of vocal fireworks, but they exist for the purpose of drama, not to show off singers. Aside from this, his use of the chorus was entirely new. Before Nabucco, an opera's chorus was limited to be only a background voice, another instrument. In Nabucco, this is abolished; he uses the chorus as character, to show the suffering and consensus of the people. The famous [...] "Va, pensiero" [...] is an example of this.|$|E
500|$|One account {{published}} by the Church of Scientology says that Hubbard theorized that [...] "the world of subatomic particles might possibly provide {{a clue to the}} human thought process" [...] and he was [...] "concerned {{for the safety of the}} world, recognising that if man were to handle the atom sanely for the greatest benefit, he would first have to learn to handle himself." [...] He enrolled on a nuclear physics course [...] "to synthesise and test all knowledge for what was observable, workable and could truly help solve man's problems." [...] Another profile calls him [...] "a product of the atomic age" [...] and describes how his classmates dreamed of unlocking the energy of the atom, while Hubbard himself sought to [...] "discover the basic equations of life force, simply, to him, another kind of energy." [...] Hubbard stated that he [...] "set out to find out from nuclear physics a knowledge of the physical universe, <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> lacking in Asian philosophy." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{has also}} been {{acclaimed}} by modern-day film historians and critics, and has often been included in lists {{of the most prominent}} experimental films. Brian Taves called it a [...] "landmark" [...] of avant-garde film, and said: [...] "A Hollywood Extra was <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> new, in both style and substance; more than any other American film, it initiated the avant-garde in this country." [...] Film historian William Moritz called it [...] "a genuine little masterpiece", and [...] "perhaps the most famous American experimental film of the 1920s". Hye Seung Chung, a film professor at Colorado State University, called the film an [...] "early American avant-garde masterpiece" [...] and described Florey as [...] "one of the most undeservingly neglected B film auteurs". David E. James called it the [...] "prototypical 20th-century avant-garde film", and wrote that A Hollywood Extras successful commercial distribution indicates experimental films were acceptable among a popular audience during its time period, [...] "rather than only an elite or mandarin audience". Director and author Lewis Jacobs wrote: [...] "Its style, broad and impressionistic, disclosed a remarkable sensitivity and resourcefulness in the use of props, painting, camera, and editing." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Scott instead {{contacted}} Lindelof {{and asked}} him to review Spaihts's script. Within the hour, a messenger delivered the script to Lindelof and informed him that he would wait outside to return it as soon as Lindelof had finished reading it. Lindelof was unaware of what Scott and the producers liked about the existing script, and informed them that he found the general concept appealing, but that the story relied too heavily on elements of the Alien films, such as the Alien creatures' life-cycle. As a direct prequel to Alien, the story was shaped to lead into that film's story, and to recreate the familiar cues of that series, and Scott wanted to avoid repeating his previous accomplishments. Lindelof said, [...] "If the ending to [...] is just going to be the room that John Hurt walks into that's full of [...] eggs , there's nothing interesting in that, because we know where it's going to end. Good stories, you don't know where they're going to end." [...] "A true prequel should essentially precede the events of the original film, but be about <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> different, feature different characters, have an entirely different theme, although it takes place in that same world." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to being Lovecraft's personal favourite of his short stories, critics generally consider [...] "The Colour Out of Space" [...] {{one of his best}} works, and the first with his trademark blending of science fiction and horror. Lovecraft scholar Donald R. Burleson referred to the tale as [...] "one of his stylistically and conceptually finest short stories." [...] Joshi praises the work as one of Lovecraft's best and most frightening, particularly for the vagueness of the description of the story's eponymous horror. He also lauded the work as Lovecraft's most successful attempt to create <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> outside of the human experience, as the creature's motive (if any) is unknown and it is impossible to discern whether or not the [...] "colour" [...] is emotional, moral, or even conscious. His only criticism is that it is [...] "just a little too long". The text of [...] "The Colour Out of Space", like many of Lovecraft's works, has fallen into public domain and can be accessed in several compilations of the author's work, {{as well as on the}} Internet. It also had a strong influence on Brian Aldiss's The Saliva Tree, which has been seen as a rewriting of Lovecraft's tale. In 1984, the novel The Color Out of Time by Michael Shea was published as a sequel to the original novelette.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, {{the video}} {{received}} positive response from critics. James Montgomery of MTV News {{said that the}} video [...] "is undoubtedly indebted to {{the past few decades}} of pop-cultural history...yet, once again, he's managed to create <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> new, too". He added that, [...] "thanks to Pinto's wattage, [...] "Gorilla" [...] goes to heights — and depths — Mars has never visited before". Billboards Jason Lipshutz found Mars supporting [...] "a more R-rated side" [...] in the video, calling the cameos by Freida Pinto and Luis Guzman unforgettable. Carl Williot of the website's Idolator thought that the new video maintained the [...] "sweaty nightclub vibe" [...] style from the previous video [...] "Locked Out of Heaven". Additionally, she felt there is a story centered on Isabella, the new dancer, and Mars, which obviously upset [...] "the club’s veteran strippers". The Times of India newspaper considered the video {{one of the most controversial}} of 2013 because of [...] "Freida Pinto strip act". Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly opined that [...] "Bruno Mars is getting real" [...] since the video was set on a strip club and featured Freida Pinto striping, licking guitars and getting intimate with Mars. Lauren Kreisler of Official Charts Company praised the video concept and concluded that it was [...] "racy as you might have expected". The video for [...] "Gorilla" [...] broke the 1 million views mark in just over an hour in 2013 on the exclusive Facebook program premiere, [...] "#NowPlaying".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Phantom Phorce was generally positive with Uncut {{stating that the}} album features an [...] "inspired overhaul" [...] of tracks from Phantom Power, the Western Mail describing the record as a [...] "mind-bending collection that radically re-works each track from the original record to create <b>something</b> <b>entirely</b> different, but equally appealing" [...] and musicOMH calling it [...] "an innovative and thoroughly enjoyable set of remixes". Some reviews {{pointed out that the}} album compares favourably with other remix albums with The Guardian calling Phantom Phorce [...] "stimulating and often rather beautiful, bucking the trend set by most other self-indulgent and pointless remix albums" [...] and the NME stating that [...] "hearing a rock band get the remix treatment is usually a mildly diverting experience rather than a life-changing one. So it's an extremely pleasant surprise to be faced with a whole album of the buggers ... and be thoroughly entertained." [...] Q stated that the commentary by 'Kurt Stern' {{was one of the best}} features of the album and The Times expressed surprise that these [...] "'amusing interludes' between tracks are actually funny", however Pitchfork Media found that 'Stern' [...] "gets in the way more than he helps" [...] and claimed that, by the time the listener had heard the full album he or she would [...] "likely consider redubbing it without [...] contributions". Reviewing Phantom Phorce for DiSCORDER magazine, Jordie Yow called it [...] "good, but not exceptional" [...] and claimed that the remixes simply made him want to listen to the original versions of the tracks while website Angry Ape was scathing, calling the album a [...] "bland & uninspiring package to put you off remixes for life" [...] and suggested that it was merely a [...] "cash-in" [...] by the band.|$|E
