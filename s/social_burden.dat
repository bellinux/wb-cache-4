60|$|There {{is nothing}} new in this: it is how {{children}} have always had and must always have their needs satisfied. The parent has to play the part of Aladdin's djinn; and many a parent has sunk beneath the burden of this service. All the novelty we need is to organize it so that instead of the individual child fastening like a parasite on its own particular parents, the whole body of children should be thrown not only upon the whole body of parents, but upon the celibates and childless as well, whose present exemption from a full share in the <b>social</b> <b>burden</b> of children is obviously unjust and unwholesome. Today {{it is easy to}} find a widow who has at great cost to herself in pain, danger, and disablement, borne six or eight children. In the same town you will find rich bachelors and old maids, and married couples with no children or with families voluntarily limited to two or three. The eight children do not belong to the woman in any real or legal sense. When she has reared them they pass away from her into the community as independent persons, marrying strangers, working for strangers, spending on the community the life that has been built up at her expense. No more monstrous injustice could be imagined than that the burden of rearing the children should fall on her alone and not on the celibates and the selfish as well.|$|E

[...] He felt stupidly annoyed and was ashamed of his annoyance, as he could have {{assigned}} no reason for it. It didn't grow less for the moment from his seeing Gabriel Nash approach Julia, introduced by Nick Dormer. He gave place to {{the two young men}} with some alacrity, for he had a sense of being put in the wrong in respect to their specimen by Nash's very presence. He remembered how it had been a part of their bargain, as it were, that he should present that gentleman to his sister. He was not sorry to be relieved of the office by Nick, and he even tacitly and ironically wished his kinsman's friend joy of a colloquy with Mrs. Dallow. Sherringham's life was spent with people, he was used to people, and both as host and as guest he carried the <b>social</b> <b>burden</b> in general lightly. He could observe, especially in the former capacity, without uneasiness and take the temperature without anxiety. But at present his company oppressed him; he felt worried and that he showed it--which was the thing in the world he had ever held least an honour to a gentleman dedicated to diplomacy. He was vexed with the levity that had made him call his roomful together on so poor a pretext, and yet was vexed with the stupidity that made the witnesses so evidently find the pretext sufficient. He inwardly groaned at the delusion under which he had saddled himself with the Tragic Muse--a tragic muse who was strident and pert--and yet wished his visitors would go away and leave him alone with her.|$|E

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) {{is closely}} {{associated}} with aging, but its underlying mechanism is unclear. Recent publications were reviewed to elucidate the connection between aging and OA. With increasing OA incidence, more senior people are facing heavy financial and <b>social</b> <b>burdens.</b> Age-related OA pathogenesis is not well understood. Recently, it has been realized that age-related changes in other tissues besides articular cartilage may also contribute to OA development. Many factors including senescence-related secretory phenotypes, chondrocytes’ low reactivity to growth factors, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, and abnormal accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) may all play key roles in the pathogenesis of age-related OA. Lately, epigenetic regulation of gene expression was recognized for its impact on age-related OA pathogenesis. Up to now, {{few studies have been}} reported about the role of miRNA and long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in age-related OA. Research focusing on this area may provide valuable insights into OA pathogenesis. OA-induced financial and <b>social</b> <b>burdens</b> have become an increasingly severe threat to older population. Age-related changes in noncartilage tissue should be incorporated in the understanding of OA development. Growing attention on oxidative stress and epigenetics will provide more important clues for the better understanding of the age-related OA...|$|R

50|$|Although most Afghans live {{in refugee}} camps near the Pakistan-Afghan border and have little contact with Pakistani society and culture, some travel to nearby cities for work or other purposes. The {{population}} of Pakistan was about 180 million in 2012, making it the world's sixth-most-populous country. Due to political unrest in Pakistan, energy crises, unemployment and strained relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, Afghan immigrants are viewed as an additional economic and <b>social</b> <b>burden</b> on Pakistan. With the Pakistani population, Afghan refugees were affected by the 2005 earthquake and 2010 floods.|$|E

Autoimmunity is the most widely accepted hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of nonsegmental vitiligo.

The importance of these criticisms rests on judging the functional adequacy of alternative networks regarding these aspects.

50|$|Siirala calls therapy the new, sharing {{transfer}} of <b>social</b> <b>burden.</b> The so-called transference of psychoanalysis is seen {{not only as}} projecting feelings to the therapist, but also as the sharing of this burden. Thus 'in order to be creative, the therapist must identify himself with the patient, share his sufferings so that he attains his goal'. This may also cause some pain to the therapist, but can {{at the same time}} make things happen that are at first sight impossible. Epistemologically Siirala stresses that therapist must keep all possibilities open, and not hang on to some preconceived theory like the oedipal theory of psychoanalysis.|$|E

50|$|The {{university}} was {{the starting point}} of the 1981 Kosovo student protests. Although the authorities again blamed the protests on nationalist radicals, contributing factors included Kosovo's cultural isolation within Yugoslavia and its endemic poverty, which resulted in the province having the highest ratio of both students and illiterates in Yugoslavia. At the same time the university system contributed to unemployment, with highly educated and resentful Albanians becoming prime recruits for nationalist sentiment. In addition, the Serb and Montenegrin population of Kosovo increasingly resented the economic and <b>social</b> <b>burden</b> incurred by the university's student population. By 1981, the University of Pristina had 20,000 students - one in ten of the city's total population.|$|E
