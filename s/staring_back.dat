25|$|As the new king, Wiglaf gives Beowulf a Norse funeral. Grendel's mother appears {{and gives}} Beowulf a final kiss before his burning ship sinks into the sea. Wiglaf sees the golden horn washed by {{the waves of}} the sea in the sand while Grendel's mother floats in the sea, looking at him seductively. The movie ends ambiguously with Wiglaf holding the horn and <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> at her, leaving his fate unknown.|$|E
25|$|Yellowcard {{promoted}} Paper Walls nonstop {{after its}} release and started touring {{to support the}} album. The group supported Blue October during the band's United States 2007 fall tour and also supported Linkin Park in Japan in November/December 2007. While touring for Paper Walls, Peter Mosely announced in a Myspace blog message {{that he would be}} leaving Yellowcard to pursue other endeavors, moving back to Jacksonville and rejoining his old band. Josh Portman from the bands Near Miss and <b>Staring</b> <b>Back</b> took over on bass until the reformation of Yellowcard in 2010, upon which Sean O'Donnell of Reeve Oliver became the bass player.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Susan {{developed}} retrograde amnesia. The storyline saw Susan slip on some spilt {{milk and}} sustain a minor head injury. After {{she goes to}} sleep, she wakes up and has lost three decades of her life. Woodburne told Inside Soap's Jason Herbison that Susan believes the year is 1972 and the night before was her sixteenth birthday, where she drank too much champagne. She does not recognise her house and thinks she passed out and ended up somewhere else. Susan's family {{take her to the}} hospital, where she is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia. Karl becomes determined to tell her the truth about her condition, while her nephew, Darcy (Mark Raffety), insists they treat her [...] "with kid gloves." [...] Woodburne revealed [...] "Susan keeps asking when she's going to be allowed home to see her parents, and eventually Karl breaks the news - her parents are long dead and she's actually 45, not 16 as she believes. And on top of that, Karl is her husband!" [...] Susan turns to her daughter Libby – who she believes is her sister Carmel (Kirsty Child) – for comfort. But when Libby confirms what Karl has told her, Susan leaves the hospital. Susan spots some students in Seventies clothes and she follows them to a Seventies themed party at Erinsborough High. However, the students recognise Susan as their principal, which distresses her. Susan ends up in the bathroom and she sees herself in the mirror {{for the first time since}} the accident, and is shocked to see a middle-aged woman <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> at her.|$|E
60|$|My {{stricken}} employer {{was lying}} on his <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> at the ceiling, and our entrance did not at first cause him to change this position.|$|R
6000|$|I am not mad: I am black. [...] I see you {{staring in}} my face-- [...] I know you <b>staring,</b> {{shrinking}} <b>back,</b> [...] Ye are {{born of the}} Washington-race, [...] And this land is the free America, [...] And this mark on my wrist--(I prove what I say) [...] Ropes tied me up here to the flogging-place.|$|R
60|$|The {{traveller}} {{recalled his}} eyes from the waste into which they had been <b>staring,</b> and fell <b>back</b> a step or so under the abruptness, and perhaps the chance appropriateness, of the question.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the months}} following, many {{problems}} had arisen between the bandmates. Ryan Key has made many comments since then stating, [...] "The fame went to our heads." [...] After months of increasing tension stemming from Ben Harper's increased involvement with his indie label Takeover Records, Harper {{was removed from}} Yellowcard. He was replaced by Ryan Mendez from the band <b>Staring</b> <b>Back.</b> After leaving Yellowcard, Harper joined Amber Pacific as a touring guitarist. Harper left the band when the group returned to the studio, with Rick Hanson assuming the permanent guitarist role. Harper {{is now in the}} band HeyMike! and runs Takeover Records in California.|$|E
2500|$|Early in the evening, the {{disguised}} Loki and Thor {{meet with}} Þrymr and the assembled jötnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of mead. Þrymr finds the behaviour {{at odds with}} his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before Þrymr and appearing as a [...] "very shrewd maid", makes the excuse that [...] "Freyja's" [...] behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. Þrymr then lifts [...] "Freyja's" [...] veil and wants to kiss [...] "her" [...] until catching the terrifying eyes <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because [...] "Freyja" [...] had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.|$|E
2500|$|The Bene Gesserit {{become the}} {{consumers}} of Idaho gholas in Heretics of Dune (1984) and Chapterhouse Dune (1985). [...] However, the gholas are repeatedly assassinated after several years, and the Sisterhood suspect the Tleilaxu. Not knowing exactly what purpose Idaho will serve, the Bene Gesserit {{believe that the}} Tleilaxu are using the gholas to control the timing of his release upon the universe, implying some Tleilaxu purpose {{in addition to their}} own. [...] The current ghola survives such an attempt and Miles Teg is able to restore the memories of Duncan Idaho to the ghola, but Duncan can feel that the Tleilaxu planted something else in his mind. When Murbella, an Honored Matre, tries to sexually bond Idaho, he entraps and enslaves her, revealing the Tleilaxu purpose: To conquer the Honored Matres by using a better version of their own sexual techniques. When Murbella tries to bond Duncan, the Tleilaxu's plan comes to fruition, and he becomes aware of the memories of all the other Idaho gholas, though he is also imprinted to her. It is later determined that the Tleilaxu had mixed the cells from almost all of the Idaho gholas to make this one. Idaho and Murbella are confined to a no-ship on Chapterhouse. [...] There, Idaho trains young men {{to go out into the}} universe and enslave Honored Matres. [...] Duncan also inherits an awkward prescient vision, wherein he sees an old man and woman <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> at him. Duncan restores the memories of the Miles Teg ghola, and escapes in the no-ship, evading the trap set for him by the strange couple.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Kemp sat in silence, <b>staring</b> at the <b>back</b> of the {{headless}} figure at the window. Then he started, {{struck by a}} thought, rose, took the Invisible Man's arm, and turned {{him away from the}} outlook.|$|R
60|$|Dennin's {{hands were}} {{released}} {{long enough for}} him to sign the document. Then a silence fell in the room. Hans was restless, and Edith felt uncomfortable. Dennin lay on his <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> straight up at the moss- chinked roof.|$|R
60|$|But Mr. Conant did not explain. He sat {{bolt upright}} on his seat, <b>staring</b> at the <b>back</b> of Bub's head, {{for the rest}} of the journey. Mary Louise noticed that his fingers {{constantly}} fumbled with the locket on his watch chain.|$|R
60|$|Evan {{was still}} <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> curiously at the beaming and bearded {{creature}} behind him.|$|E
60|$|She gave {{an audible}} gasp, {{and looked at}} me so fearfully that I fell silent, <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> at her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sufferin' Moses!" [...] ejaculated the {{astonished}} major, <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> {{into her}} twinkling eyes, [...] "if this kapes on, we'll be millionaires, Patsy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] said Flambeau, as {{the priest}} put his cigar {{in his mouth}} again and leaned <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> at the roof, [...] "suppose {{somebody}} else did use the scissors. Why should somebody else, cutting pieces off his sermon paper, make Quinton commit suicide?" ...|$|R
60|$|Some seconds he {{remained}} on his <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> at the whitewashed ceiling {{and listening to}} the patter of the rain against his window. Then, as his mind gathered up the threads of recollection, he leapt from his bed and made haste to assume a garment or two.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{all went}} on with our work as ’ard as we knew ’ow. The skipper {{was talking to the}} mate about ’is injuries, and saying unkind things about Germans, when he give a sort of a shout and {{staggered}} <b>back</b> <b>staring.</b> We just looked round, and there was them two blackamoors coming slowly towards us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Run, ye fools!" [...] he shouted. But {{we stood}} still, with yearning eyes <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> through the frantic forms for a sight of Tom's.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned and}} stared at Martin, and Martin, <b>staring</b> <b>back,</b> noted the puffed and {{discolored}} face, handsome and weak, and {{knew that he had}} been making a night of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "That isn't {{the way to}} put it," [...] remarked Chubbins, <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> {{into the}} eyes of the squirrel. [...] "You should ask how we {{children}} happened to have birds' bodies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perfectly, {{as you do}} the picture-book. Well, there I was lying, Miss Baker, with {{my little}} eyes wide open. It is {{astonishing}} how much babies see, though people never calculate on their having eyes at all. I was lying on my <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> at the mantelpiece, on which my mother had left her key-basket." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{even if it}} wasn't," [...] said Stalky, flat on his <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> {{into the}} blue. [...] "Even suppose we were miles out of bounds, no one could get at us through this wuzzy, unless he knew the tunnel. Isn't this better than lyin' up just behind the Coll.--in a blue funk every time we had a smoke? Isn't your Uncle Stalky--?" ...|$|R
60|$|Should he tell Ghibba? Should he wait? And {{while he}} was {{fretting}} in doubt whether or no, there came a sharp, short yelp, and suddenly out of the thorn-trees skipped a Mountain-mulgar, and came scampering helter-skelter over the frozen snow, yelping and chattering as he ran. Following close behind him lumbered Thumb, who hobbled a little way, then stopped and turned <b>back,</b> <b>staring.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him over her spectacles. He was <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> at her, unswerving. She met his eyes for a moment, then took off her glasses. He was white. The male was up in him, dominant. She {{did not want to see}} him too clearly.|$|E
60|$|All {{the hope}} {{remaining}} {{in her life}} was in that question, was in {{her face as she}} searched mine with a terrible scrutiny. And never had I known such an ordeal. It seemed as if I could not answer, and as I stood <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> at her a smile was forced to her lips.|$|E
60|$|But {{the prince}} saw the {{reflections}} {{of all the}} others, and then made the discovery that the forms of the Ki and the High Ki had become invisible. No one except himself appeared to be standing in the great hall of the Red Rogue's castle! Yet grouped within the glass were the likenesses of all his friends, {{as well as those}} of Lady Seseley and her companions; and all were <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> at him earnestly, as if imploring him to save them.|$|E
60|$|They fell <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> and uttering {{expressions}} of rough {{wonder at the}} advance of the lady in her glistening silk, but as she knelt down by the poor creature, held her on her arm, bathed her face with scent on her own handkerchief, and held to her lips the champagne that Raymond poured out, {{there was a kind}} of hoarse cheer.|$|R
60|$|The exhibit {{was lying}} on his <b>back</b> <b>staring</b> at {{the roof of the}} berth. By lying {{absolutely}} still and forcing himself to think of purely inland scenes and objects he had contrived to reduce the green in his complexion to a mere tinge. But it would be paltering with the truth to say that he felt debonair. He received Sam with a wan austerity.|$|R
60|$|And so we {{will leave}} them. In about half an hour, when the short {{twilight}} was becoming dusk, Mrs. Woodward returned, and found Norman standing alone on the hearthrug before the fireplace. Gertrude was away, and he {{was leaning against the}} mantelpiece, with his hands behind his <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> at vacancy; but oh! with such an aspect of dull, speechless agony in his face.|$|R
60|$|Like two frightened rabbits they {{crouched}} {{under the}} fir, <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> with wild round eyes over the trail, fearing every instant {{to see the}} savage pack {{break out of the}} woods and come howling after them. But only the single big wolf appeared, trotting quietly along in their footsteps. Within bowshot he stopped with head raised, looking, listening intently. Then, as if he had seen them in their hiding, he turned aside, circled widely to the left, and entered the woods far below.|$|E
60|$|She {{slowed the}} car down to fifteen an hour. For {{the first time}} she began to watch the road behind her. In a few minutes a moving spot showed in the dust three miles back. Oh, naturally; he would still be behind her. Only---- If she stopped, just to look at the scenery, he would go on ahead of her. She stopped for a moment--for a time too brief to {{indicate}} that anything had gone wrong with her car. <b>Staring</b> <b>back</b> she saw that the bug stopped also, and she fancied that Milt was out standing beside it, peering with his palm over his eyes--a spy, unnatural and disturbing in the wide peace.|$|E
60|$|Godwin gave {{a sigh of}} relief. If Masouda had {{appointed}} to meet her uncle the Arab, at least she must be safe. So it was no voice of hers which seemed to whisper {{his name in the}} darkness of the night when terror had ahold of him--terror, born perhaps of all that he had endured and the shadow of death through which he had so lately passed. Then he looked up, to find Wulf <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> at the woman behind him, and reproved him, saying that he must keep to the spirit of the bargain as well as to the letter, and that if he might not speak he must not look either.|$|E
60|$|He {{lay on his}} <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> {{straight}} up at one single star that rocked mistily through a thinning of cloud-stuff overhead. The old ache was in his throat, the old harsh dryness in mouth and eyes. And he knew--what no other man knew--why {{he was in the}} Solomons, skipper of the teak-built yacht Arangi, running niggers, risking his head, and drinking more Scotch whiskey than was good for any man.|$|R
60|$|So Peter scampered over to {{the tall}} pine in which was Blacky's old nest. As he sat with his head tipped <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> up at it, it struck him that that nest didn't look so old, after all. In fact, {{it looked as if}} it had {{recently}} been fixed up quite like new. He was wondering about this and trying to guess what it meant, when Blacky himself alighted close to the edge of it.|$|R
60|$|It was Obergatz; {{the curse}} {{had told her}} that. From below came no further sound. Had she, then, killed him? She prayed so--with all her heart she prayed it. To be freed from the menace of this loathsome {{creature}} were relief indeed. During all {{the balance of the}} night she lay there awake, listening. Below her, she imagined, she could see the dead man with his hideous face bathed in the cold light of the moon--lying there upon his <b>back</b> <b>staring</b> up at her.|$|R
