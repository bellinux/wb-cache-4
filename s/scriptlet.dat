40|$|International audienceThis article {{presents}} {{an outline of}} a script theory of guidance for computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). With its four types of components of internal and external scripts (play, scene, role, and <b>scriptlet)</b> and seven principles, this theory addresses the question how CSCL practices are shaped by dynamically re-configured internal collaboration scripts of the participating learners. Furthermore, it explains how internal collaboration scripts develop through participation in CSCL practices. It {{emphasizes the importance of}} active application of subject matter knowledge in CSCL practices, and it prioritizes transactive over non-transactive forms of knowledge application in order to facilitate learning. Further, the theory explains how external collaboration scripts modify CSCL practices and how they influence the development of internal collaboration scripts. The principles specify an optimal scaffolding level for external collaboration scripts and allow for the formulation of hypotheses about the fading of external collaboration scripts. Finally, the article points towards conceptual challenges and future research questions...|$|E

50|$|Over the years, the {{expression}} language has evolved {{to include more}} advanced functionality and it {{was included in the}} JSP 2.0 specification. Scripting was made easier for web-content designers who have little or practically no knowledge of the core Java Language. This scripting language made JSP a scripting language in the true sense. Before EL, JSP consisted of some special tags like <b>scriptlets,</b> expressions etc. within which Java code was written explicitly. With EL the web-content designer needs only to know how to make proper calls to core Java methods.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Medical Data and Picture Exchange {{platform}} (MDPE), as a teleradiology system, {{facilitates the}} exchange of digital medical imaging data among authorized users. It features extensive support of the DICOM standard including networking functions. Since MDPE is designed as a web service, security and confidentiality of data and communication pose an outstanding challenge. To comply with demands of German laws and authorities, a generic data security concept considered as “best practice ” in German health telematics was adapted to the specific demands of MDPE. The concept features strict logical and physical separation of diagnostic and identity data and thus an all-encompassing pseudonymization throughout the system. Hence, data may only be merged at authorized clients. MDPE’s solution of merging data from separate sources within a web browser avoids technically questionable techniques such as deliberate cross-site scripting. Instead, data is merged dynamically by JavaScriptlets running in the user’s browser. These <b>scriptlets</b> are provided by one server, while content and method calls are generated by another server. Additionally, MDPE uses encrypted temporary IDs for communication and merging of data...|$|R
30|$|The HTML 5 {{specification}} introduced Web Storage, a {{new state}} management mechanism for the Web [18]. The standard supports session storage and persistent storage, both indexed by origin. A storage object is a simple associative array. Although stored objects are governed by the same origin policy, they can participate in cross-domain data sharing {{through the use of}} another HTML 5 mechanism, Web Messaging[19]. Web Messaging is a JavaScript API for data exchange between browser windows. The communicating parties (<b>scriptlets)</b> may belong to different origins; they themselves make the decision whether to send (receive) a message based on the recipient’s (sender’s) origin. The significant advantage of the Web Storage/Web Messaging combination is its acceptance by the market. (Although [18, 19] are only draft specifications, they have been implemented by all major browsers [6].) It requires careful client-side coding, however. Although both senders and recipients are encouraged to check each other’s origins [20], in practice this is done inconsistently. For example, Hanna et al. [21] discovered that two of the most popular users of Web Messaging, Facebook Connect and Google Friend Connect, perform these checks only sporadically; the authors were able to compromise message integrity and confidentiality of both protocols. Our approach, on the other hand, does not require any coding; it abstracts security decisions into a small set of simple data structures (channel and authorization certificates) that lend themselves to efficient unified management by Web sites.|$|R
