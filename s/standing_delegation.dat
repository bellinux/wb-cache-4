40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{contribution}} that the European Parliament’s <b>standing</b> committees, <b>delegations</b> and inter-parliamentary assemblies make as diplomatic actors in the post-Lisbon Treaty period. These three types of bodies and institutions are grouped together, because in practice they work in complementary ways. The committees play a coordinating role, the delegations act as ‘embassies on the move’ and {{the participation of the}} European Parliament in inter-parliamentary assemblies represents the clearest institutional sign of the European Parliament’s external action. The {{article focuses on}} a case study: the involvement of the European Parliament in the EU’s partnership with the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of countries (ACP) through the Development Committee (DEVE), the competent European Parliament delegation, and the activities within the Joint Parliamentary Assembly. The article aims to analyse whether and how the European Parliament is able to play a distinctive diplomatic role through its <b>standing</b> committees, <b>delegations</b> and inter-parliamentary assemblies...|$|R

5000|$|Hallam visited Israel {{several times}} with this <b>standing</b> <b>delegation.</b> He {{made it clear}} that his top {{priority}} would be to encourage peace and trade. “Building trade links is a good investment because when the peace process is complete there are ambitious Israeli and Arab plans for the Jordan Basin to become an economic powerhouse for the entire region”. [...] His continued interest in Israel resurfaced in 2010 when the Methodist Church of which Hallam is a member and accredited local preacher published a report that Hallam considered to be unfair and misleading.|$|E
50|$|Following the election, a {{task force}} {{composed}} {{of a number of}} councillors, controllers, and citizen representatives was established to make recommendations on governance. The task force held numerous meetings and public hearings. On the basis of its deliberations, it recommended that the board of control be abolished and its functions assumed by a combination of <b>standing</b> committees, <b>delegation</b> to staff and citizen groups and Committee of the Whole. The recommendations were placed before a public participation meeting and subsequently adopted by council in a vote of 14 to 5. Consequently, positions for Board of Control were not on the 2010 municipal ballot.|$|R

Bečić received the forty-eighth position on the Radical Party list; the party won twenty-three seats, and Bečić was again included {{as part of its}} parliamentary delegation.

5000|$|McLaughlin {{believed}} his {{mission was to}} make Native Americans self-sufficient by encouraging them to assimilate, to become educated according to Western standards and to adopt white/Anglo-American culture, including subsistence farming. Local climate and geographic conditions made such style of agriculture difficult in the Dakotas, as allotments proved to be too small. In 1888, he and other agents accompanied a large delegation of chiefs from the six Sioux reservations to Washington, DC to meet with Bureau of Indian Affairs officials to discuss the Dawes Act. A photograph of McLaughlin and the <b>Standing</b> Rock <b>delegation,</b> including the noted chief Sitting Bull and interpreter Louis Primeau, along with US Commissioners, US Indian Agents, interpreters and many Sioux chiefs, was taken {{on the front steps}} of the capital in 1888. The leaders were meeting to discuss implementation of the Dawes Act at the Great Sioux Reservation, then consisting of 22 million acres. The act called for distributing the reservation's communal lands as allotments to heads of individual households. The government intended for the Lakota to adopt subsistence-style farming on the European-American model and give up their nomadic hunting lifestyle. Under the legislation, the government would declare remaining lands after allotment as [...] "surplus," [...] to be made available for sale to non-Lakota people.|$|R
50|$|Pro-reform politicians, such as Motilal Nehru, {{were caught}} off guard when the {{organized}} women's association met with leaders to ask for their support in the bill. The all-India women's association pressured politicians for their support in the bill, <b>standing</b> outside their <b>delegations</b> holding placards and shouting slogans such as 'if you oppose Sarda's bill, the world will laugh at you'. It was also this group who pushed for, and eventually succeeded in having Gandhi address the evils of child marriage in his speeches. Victory for the bill can be credited to the women's association, who presented the act {{as a means for}} India to demonstrate its commitment to modernity. Women in India were now challenging the double standards set in place by ancient shastras. Declaring they would begin to make their own laws, free of male influence, the women's organization brought liberal feminism to a forefront.|$|R
40|$|Problem: Process {{analysis}} and staff interviews revealed several barriers to appropriate adult vaccination. <b>Standing</b> <b>delegation</b> {{orders for the}} administration of both flu and Pneumovax vaccines have been utilized for many years. Surveying the staff, however, revealed that few knew about the standing orders and even fewer were comfortable using them. Most staff was unaware of Pneumovax administration year round. Evidence: Pneumonia mortality rate is a staggering 5 - 36 percent in adults and 18 - 60 percent in the elderly (Zimmerman, Tabbrah, & Norwalk 2005). It is undeniably important that qualifying patients are vaccinated. Strategy: A multidisciplinary group was organized {{to look at these}} issues. From this group an algorithmic form was developed making it easy to evaluate the patient’s need for the vaccination. Documentation was made available to report refusal, contraindication or a vaccine given outside the hospital network. A round report was developed so an overview of the entire unit and immunization needs could be identified...|$|E
