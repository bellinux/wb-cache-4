A few steps up from the yard is the Back House where against the wall are six Washbacks, two holding 6,000 gallons and four holding 3,500 gallons; also a Miller's Refrigerator and the Wash Charger with a capacity of 3,500 gallons.

The heat of the shearer ranging arm comes mainly from the <b>gears,</b> bearings and <b>stirring</b> oil by <b>gears.</b> There are four main ways of heat dissipation for the shearer ranging arm: convective heat transfer between the ranging arm shell and air flow; heat removal by the cooling water of the ranging arms; heat absorption by the lube oil of the ranging arm; radial heat transfer between ranging arm and its connection devices.|$|R
