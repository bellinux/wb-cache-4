50|$|The Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry {{of western}} Colorado yields {{one of the}} most diverse Upper Jurassic {{vertebrate}} assemblages in the world. This fossil assemblage was deposited within a poorly sorted <b>sandstone</b> <b>bed</b> that is stratigraphically situated in the lower portion of the upper Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation. The bone accumulation, consisting of thousands of bones, was the consequence of two cataclysmic events, a drought, and flash flood. In the Dry Mesa area, a severe drought resulted in the mass mortality of dinosaurs and other vertebrates. These animals were attracted to a remnant water hole of the dry Lake T'oo'dichi' lake bed where they died of starvation and dehydration. This mass mortality produced a considerable accumulation of disarticulated vertebrate remains. Subsequently, a short-lived flash flood traversed the dry lake beds. The quarry <b>sandstone</b> <b>bed</b> is a 2 meter thick, 121 meter wide, very poorly sorted pebble-rich sublitharenite. The channel sandstone shows abundant trough cross-stratification and a possible antidune bedform composed of gravel and sand which indicates flow velocities as high as 200 cm/s (5 miles/hour). Measured bone volumes can be equated to flow velocities. These calculated bone volume velocities are in agreement with flow velocities determined from grain size and bedforms. The river flow direction, based upon bedform orientations and bone elongation statistics, was to the east-northeast. Geologic and taphonomic characteristics indicate a short transport distance for the bone accumulation (Richmond and Morris, 1999).|$|E
50|$|Abydosaurus {{is based}} on DINO 16488, a nearly {{complete}} skull and lower jaws with the first four neck vertebrae. Abundant skull and postcranial bones were found at the same site, including partial skulls from three additional individuals, a partial hip and associated tail vertebrae, a shoulder blade, an upper arm bone, and hand bones. These fossils were found in a <b>sandstone</b> <b>bed</b> {{at the base of}} the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation, near the old visitor center of Dinosaur National Monument. Zircons from mudstones beneath the bone-bearing sandstone indicate the age of the sandstone and the its contained bones is less than 104.46 ± 0.95 million years, in the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous.|$|E
50|$|Dr. James W. Gidley (1930) {{originally}} {{interpreted the}} Smithsonian fossiliferous red <b>sandstone</b> <b>bed</b> {{to have been}} deposited in a bog or water hole. Death of the animals, he thought, {{was the result of}} attrition. C. L. Gazin (1934) agreed with Gidley’s depositional interpretation, but suggested the bog may have trapped the animals. Basing their conclusions on historical information, photographs, and collection samples, Akersten and Thompson (1992) proposed the fossil accumulation {{was the result of a}} single flood event, which trapped and killed the horses, then transported their carcasses. They concluded that deposition and burial of the carcasses occurred during subsequent flooding events. Basing his interpretation on historical information and photographs coupled with a population configuration of ancient horse herds, G. McDonald (1996) suggested the horses were killed in a single catastrophic flood event.|$|E

50|$|The {{base of the}} Hastings Beds and the Ashdown Formation {{is taken}} {{at the top of}} the Greys Limestones Member of the Purbeck Beds, {{although}} this boundary is not currently exposed anywhere in the Weald. The top of the Ashdown Formation is marked as the top of a massive <b>sandstone</b> <b>bed</b> known as the Top Ashdown Sandstone. This is overlain by an easily identified very coarse grained sandstone known as the Top Ashdown Pebble Bed, which is considered to be part of the overlying Wadhurst Clay Formation. The Top Ashdown Sandstone is the most persistent marker horizon in Early Cretaceous strata throughout the region. It comprises a fine to medium grained sandstone ranging in thickness from 1.2m to 8m. Other marker beds can be found throughout the formation including the Cliff End Sandstone and the Lee Ness Sandstone.|$|E
50|$|Langcliffe Pot is a solutional cave formed within {{rocks of}} the Yoredale Series of the Pendlian and Brigantian substages of the Mississippian epoch of the Carboniferous period. The Yoredale Group {{consists}} {{of a number of}} cyclothems, with sequences of sandstones, shales and thin coals separating limestones into well-defined beds separated by aquicludes. The upper part of the cave is formed {{at the base of the}} Middle Limestone and the passages run down dip towards the south-east, floored by sandstone. In Boireau Falls Chamber the stream cuts through the 50 cm <b>sandstone</b> <b>bed,</b> and then through 4 m of shale into the Simonstone Limestone. Nemesis Pitch drops straight through this, and the Gassson Series is formed totally within the Hardraw Limestone. The resurgence at Black Keld, some 174 m below the lowest point of Langcliffe Pot, lies in the Great Scar Limestone.|$|E

The park {{is the home}} of Cumberland Falls, {{sometimes}} called the Little Niagara, the Niagara of the South or the Great Falls and is the only venue in the Western Hemisphere where a moonbow or lunar rainbow is regularly visible on a clear night with a full moon. On average the falls, which flow over a resistant <b>sandstone</b> <b>bed,</b> are 68 feet (21 m) high and 125 feet (38 m) wide, with an average water flow of [...] per second (100 m³/s).Trails winding downstream from the park {{on either side of the}} river lead to the smaller Angel Falls and Dog Slaughter Falls. Angel Falls is located 1.5 mi from the park on the McCreary County side and Dog Slaughter Falls is located 3.5 mi from the park on the Whitley County side. The Below the Falls section of the river includes a five-mile (8 km) long class 2-3 run that is ideal for families and beginner stage white water rafters and kayakers.|$|E
40|$|The {{subsurface}} of the West European gas province contains up {{to several}} hundred meters thick continuous Upper Rotliegend and Lower Triassic mud rock sequences which have to date been labelled as nonreservoir ‘waste zone’. The mud rock formed as fluvial floodplain deposits in a semi-arid climate. The sequences contain thin-bedded porous and permeable <b>sandstone</b> <b>beds</b> of crevasse-splay origin. A core study of Triassic deposits in the West Netherlands Basin shows that the <b>sandstone</b> <b>beds</b> are nested in up to 2 -m-thick sand-prone heterolithic stacks with net-to-gross up to 0. 5. Because of the heterolithic nature and small bed thickness the sand-prone intervals are not detected by the gamma-ray log. An outcrop analogue study of fluvial sediments in the Altiplano Basin of Bolivia shows that the crevasse-splay sediments amalgamate laterally to extensive sand sheets with surface areas of several square kilometres. Combination of the core and outcrop study suggests that the nested <b>sandstone</b> <b>beds</b> may constitute secondary plays with economically interesting gas reservoir volumes that may help postpone the end of field-life in mature production areas.
