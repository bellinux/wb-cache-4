40|$|In this paper, {{the local}} {{asymptotic}} estimation for the supremum of a random walk and its applications are presented. The summands of the random walk have common long-tailed and generalized strong <b>subexponential</b> <b>distribution.</b> This distribution {{class and the}} corresponding generalized local <b>subexponential</b> <b>distribution</b> class are two new distribution classes with some good properties. Further, some long-tailed distributions with intuitive and concrete forms are found, which show that {{the intersection of the}} two above-mentioned distribution classes with long-tailed distribution class properly contain the strong <b>subexponential</b> <b>distribution</b> class and the locally <b>subexponential</b> <b>distribution</b> class, respectively.

X(T) where {X(t) } is a {{stochastic}} process with a linear drift and satisfying some regularity conditions like a {{central limit theorem}} and a large deviations principle, and T is an independent r. v. with a <b>subexponential</b> <b>distribution.</b> We find that the tail of X(T) is sensitive {{to whether or not}} T has a heavier or lighter tail than a Weibull distribution with tail. This leads to two distinct cases, heavy tailed and moderately heavy tailed, but also some results for the classical light-tailed case are given. The results are applied via distributional Little's law to establish tail asymptotics for steady-state queue length in GI/GI/ 1 queues with subexponential service times.
