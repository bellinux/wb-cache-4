50|$|Thera variata, the <b>spruce</b> <b>carpet,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is found {{throughout}} Europe, North Asia and Japan. The common name <b>spruce</b> <b>carpet</b> is also used when referring to Thera britannica.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>spruce</b> <b>carpet</b> (Thera britannica) is {{a species}} of moth. It is a double-brooded species, meaning it has two broods in one year. Its wings are colored with {{different}} shades of gray, but the spring brood tends to have more brown colors.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{faunistic}} survey of Macrolepidoptera in Loučany (foothills of the Šumava Mts, Czech Republic). The research, involving different capture methods, proceeded from April to November 2015 on given transect and several other habitats. Based on the results (including partial data from 2013 and {{the last two decades}} of the 20 th century), an inventory of identified species of Macrolepidoptera was made. Altogether 205 species from 16 families were found in Loučany. The most important species are for example the Black-veined White (Aporia crataegi), High Brown Fritillary (Argynnis adippe), Pearl-bordered Fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), Purple Emperor (Apatura iris), <b>Spruce</b> <b>Carpet</b> (Thera britannica) and Sandy Carpet (Perizoma affinitata). The environmental parameters of experimental sites were noticed during research and the habitat preferences of species were analysed using specialized literature. Altogether 186 species (90, 7 % of all identified species) are linked to some kind of woodland habitat. To support present biodiversity of the community of Macrolepidoptera, it is necessary to practice a suitable woodland management, conserving mosaicity and open canopy. Key words: Lepidoptera, species diversity, Czech Republic, Klatovy area, conservation, woodland managemen...|$|E
50|$|There {{are places}} that are seldom travelled, {{especially}} southeast of Sand Lake, west of Crooked Lake, and north of the Middle Branch of the Oswegatchie River. A large <b>Carpet</b> <b>Spruce</b> swamp exists in this area, intermixed with blowdown and rocks. The Middle Branch of the Oswegatchie, west of Willy's Lake and north of a private inholding at Bear Pond is not canoeable.|$|R
