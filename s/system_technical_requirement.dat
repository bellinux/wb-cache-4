50|$|Modern Military Operations often employ {{commercial}} satellites {{to fulfill}} theater capacity requirements. However, as modern military warfare is highly asymmetric and mobile, military units desire a SATCOM-on-the-move system. Currently, military units procure this capability from SOTM vendors such as EM Solutions, Alico Systems, Boeing, Gilat Satellite Networks, Comtech Mobile, Datapath, General Dynamics, iDirect, Inmarsat (BGAN), L3, Raytheon, Exelis or ViaSat. Comparison between these systems is difficult {{due to the}} differences between the technologies and service offerings. Military procurements might benefit from a common set of system requirements from which to evaluate different systems and product offerings. This article presents a survey of the SOTM market, product offerings, and technologies. It concludes with a summary of <b>system</b> <b>technical</b> <b>requirements</b> and drivers for the operation of MILSATCOM-on-the-Move over commercial satellite systems.|$|R

This system was developed by Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems and Global Services and L- 3 Communications Telemetry-West as part of the Range Standardization and Automation (RSA) IIA program. Requirements included real-time simultaneous acquisition of 16 PCM streams at rates of up to 30 M bits per second; real-time processing; and data display on workstations connected over a gigabit Ethernet network. This system is designed for range safety and needs to be fault-tolerant while maintaining 100 percent data availability {{in the event of a}} single failure during an operation. The development of such a system demanded a rigorous Systems Engineering approach to ensure the successful upgrade and deployment onto the range infrastructure.

30|$|Our {{simulation}} {{results support the}} current situation in Tasmania. The current position for Tasmania is that the minimum demand can be as low as 900  MW, Basslink may be importing up to 478  MW and wind can contribute up to 308  MW. Under these conditions, there is little room left for synchronous generation. If the minimum <b>system</b> <b>technical</b> <b>requirements</b> for ROCOF and FCAS availability cannot be met within the central dispatch process, AEMO’s constraints will limit Basslink flow and/or wind farm output so that more on-island synchronous generation is provided. Tasmania has currently around 1470  MWs of synchronous condenser capability comprising of 14 hydro units, 3 open cycle gas turbine (OCGT) units and 2 local synchronous condensers installed at Musselroe wind farm [12]. System constraints can be alleviated by dispatching selected hydro generators in synchronous condenser mode. Inertia addition and contingency reduction can reduce fast FCAS requirements. However, under the existing rules, AEMO {{does not have a}} mechanism to dispatch this service and the service is provided by Hydro Tasmania on a voluntary basis. The cost of energy used to operate in this mode, along with the associated operation and maintenance costs, is ignored by the market.|$|R

40|$|Modern {{industrial}} automatic {{machines and}} robotic cells {{are equipped with}} highly complex human-machine interfaces (HMIs) that often prevent human operators from an effective use of the automatic systems. In particular, this applies to vulnerable users, such as those with low experience or education level, the elderly and the disabled. To tackle this issue, it becomes necessary to design user-oriented HMIs, which adapt to the capabilities and skills of users, thus compensating their limitations and taking full advantage of their knowledge. In this paper, we propose a methodological approach {{to the design of}} complex adaptive human-machine systems that might be inclusive of all users, in particular the vulnerable ones.

The study was based on the perspectives {{of students enrolled in}} a fully online program at a small community college in western Maine. They were interviewed individually to find out: (a) what are the perceptions of participants toward the materials presented in the orientation after completing their first semester; (b) what aspects of the orientation resonate most with participants when it comes to completing a course (nature of online learning, how to use course management <b>system,</b> <b>technical</b> <b>requirements</b> or learning skills and motivation). Besides the interviews, data was collected from the college’s learning management system. The results of the study show that participants were satisfied with the content of the orientation; however, more information pertaining to specific aspects of the learning management system should be included for additional satisfaction. Participants requested additional information concerning navigating courses, turning in assignments, and posting on discussion boards. The information provided in the interviews was consistent with the theory presented by Rovai’s (2003) persistence model. Participants’ perceptions fell into tow categories, personal and technical. These results were consistent with the current literature pertaining to online courses, orientations, and persistence. The results and findings of this study add to the body of knowledge concerning what materials in an orientation program are most effective in helping students complete online courses. The participants in this study perceived information about the use of the learning management system to be most important.
