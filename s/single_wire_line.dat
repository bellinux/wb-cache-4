Coaxial tapers at the wire ends adapt the wave impedance to the 50 amp; 1049139; impedance of coaxial cables, sources and receivers. But for guiding the electromagnetic wave, the Goubau Line relies on the realistic boundary conditions imposed by an insulated wire instead of using a coaxial shield.

The analysis is based on the solution of the corresponding space-time Hallen integral equation and it is carried out directly in the time domain. The influence of a two media configuration is taken into account via the space time reflection coefficient arising from the modified image theory. The corresponding integral equation is handled via the time domain Galerkin-Bubnov variant of the boundary element method (GB-BEM).

5000|$|... ==Power supply == The ideal {{warning light}} {{must be able}} to power itself while clamped to a <b>single</b> <b>wire</b> of the <b>line.</b> Lights may be powered either from the {{electric}} field surrounding the energized wire, or the magnetic field produced by current through the wire. The first approach takes advantage of the high electric potential gradient between conductors, but a strong enough capacitive coupling is requested to allow capacitive extraction of the power required from the warning light. This means that long conductors must be suspended parallel to the line using glass/ceramic isolators: in fact several meters of suspended conductor are generally required, total length being inversely proportional to the line voltage. The second approach is based on Faraday's law of induction involving magnetic flux flowing through a circuit which powers the warning light.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{establishes}} comprehensive {{methodology for}} characterization of metallic nanowires (NWs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), {{and evaluation of}} their performance for interconnect applications at microwave/ mm-wave/THz frequencies. The research {{focus is on the}} development of modeling and measurement methods to determine constitutive material parameters, i. e. conductivity, and contact resistance of platinum (Pt) NWs, {{as well as on the}} development of modeling approaches to evaluate characteristic parameters for antennas, nano-coaxial <b>lines,</b> and <b>single</b> <b>wire</b> transmission <b>lines</b> composed of CNTs. Applicability of traditional two-port measurements is investigated for accurate determination of material parameters for Pt NWs over a broad frequency range. Two test-setups are developed. First, several configurations with directly contacted Pt NWs to a host coplanar waveguide (CPW) structure are designed and realized to determine the conductivity and contact resistance. Full-wave finite element and circuit models are used to determine the two parameters by fitting simulations to measurements. It is found that the single measurement setup with direct contacts cannot determine the two parameters simultaneously. To solve this problem, two approaches based on transmission line and lumped element models for Pt NWs are developed. Both approaches employ a set of two NWs with different lengths. The feasibility of both approaches is thoroughly studied and relevant conclusions are made. An approach based on lumped element models is validated experimentally, and it is shown that the contact resistance and conductivity of 300 nm diameter Pt NWs are about 50 W and 0. 013 sbulk, respectively. In the second setup, the capacitive coupling contact between the Pt NWs and the CPW structure is exploited to determine the NW’s conductivity. Two variations of this setup, specifically in-slot and on-dielectric configurations, are developed. Full-wave finite-element models are utilized to demonstrate suitability of the two configurations and to determine the conductivity of Pt NWs by fitting to measurements. Structural and elemental analyses of fabricated devices are conducted to assess fabrication and measurement issues. Full-wave modeling for individual CNTs and CNT bundles is performed by the use of method of moments and finite element method codes in order to CNTs as antennas, nano-coaxial <b>lines,</b> and <b>single</b> <b>wire</b> transmission <b>lines.</b> Characteristic parameters, such as impedance, gain, efficiency, and line loss for each interconnect are evaluated and compared to those of their copper-based counterparts. Results show better performance of CNTs over conventional metals at microwave frequencies. The extension of modeling and metrology for semiconducting NWs and CNTs, and the study of graphene at microwave frequencies are proposed as directions for future work...|$|R

This paper analyses {{one of the key}} issues: protection of the network, by ascertaining the impact of rotary DG inclusion on existing protection system of SWER (<b>single</b> <b>wire</b> earth return) <b>lines</b> and the DG sensitivity during faults. The analysis is carried out by estimating fault-sensitivity for the worst-case situation, determining the DG impact on the existing protection scheme, and comparing the network situation with and without DG during the fault. A model of arc voltage is used to represent a fault on a SWER scheme. The size of DG is selected based on the SWER capacity and SWER load. The study is conducted on an example SWER system by considering the SWER lines with and without DG and faults on the SWER backbone and laterals, and simulation results are reported. In every case studied, the fault current from the DG significantly exceeded the DG rating and the DG would have tripped. Thus the system reverts to the case with no DG. Even if DG did not trip, the fault current from the source would be largely independent of the DG, and thus the original feeder protection would continue to provide the same quality of performance. Hence, net sensitivity and existing protection system will not be adversely affected by DG inclusion in SWER lines...|$|R
