5|$|<b>Sperm</b> <b>competition</b> and {{chemicals}} introduced to females through mating {{have a negative}} effect on females and their lifespan. In males, production of the spermatophore, sperm, and secondary chemicals reduces their lifespan. As the number of copulations increase, the rate of mortality also increases in both sexes.|$|E
5|$|Promiscuity, {{in which}} {{both males and females}} mate with {{multiple}} partners, also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females give birth to litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased <b>sperm</b> <b>competition</b> and males tend to have larger testicles. In the Cape ground squirrel, the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length. Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{is often}} aerial and often {{involves}} pheromones. Butterflies then {{land on the}} ground or on a perch to mate. Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may last from minutes to hours. Simple photoreceptor cells located at the genitals are important for this and other adult behaviours. The male passes a spermatophore to the female; to reduce <b>sperm</b> <b>competition,</b> he may cover her with his scent, or in some species such as the Apollos (Parnassius) plugs her genital opening to prevent her from mating again.|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{into the}} {{evolution}} of reproductive barriers have traditionally focused on closely related species, and the prevalence of conspecific sperm precedence. The effectiveness of conspecific sperm precedence at limiting gene exchange between species suggests that gametic isolation {{is an important component}} of reproductive isolation. However, there is a paucity of tests for evidence of sperm precedence during the earlier stages of divergence, for example among isolated populations. Here, we sourced individuals from two allopatric populations of house mice (Mus domesticus) and performed competitive in vitro fertilisation assays to test for conpopulation sperm precedence specifically at the gametic level. We found that ova population origin did not influence the outcome of the <b>sperm</b> <b>competitions,</b> and thus provide no evidence of conpopulation or heteropopulation sperm precedence. Instead, we found that males from a population that had evolved under a high level of postcopulatory sexual selection consistently outcompeted males from a population that had evolved under a relatively lower level of postcopulatory sexual selection. We standardised the number of motile sperm of each competitor across the replicate assays. Our data therefore show that competitive fertilizing success was directly attributable to differences in sperm fertilizing competence...|$|R
50|$|Interestingly, remating {{shortly after}} {{copulation}} {{is impossible for}} these grasshoppers. The act of copulation prompts a physiological and behavioral response in females termed “secondary defense”. During secondary defense, the female will respond to male attempts at copulation with strong, directed kicks of the hindlegs, which will deter the males and make forced mating impossible since the female may be almost {{twice as large as}} the male. This is actually advantageous for the male, as it protects his <b>sperm</b> from <b>competition</b> with other males before the pair's eggs are laid. This stage may last 3 to 4 days.|$|R

5|$|Lemurs lack any shared {{traits that}} make them stand out from all other primates. Different types of lemurs have evolved unique {{combinations}} of unusual traits to cope with Madagascar's harsh, seasonal climate. These traits can include seasonal fat storage, hypometabolism (including torpor and hibernation), small group sizes, low encephalization (relative brain size), cathemerality (activity both day and night), and strict breeding seasons. Extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding are also thought to {{have given rise to}} three other relatively common lemur traits: female social dominance, sexual monomorphism, and male–male competition for mates involving low levels of agonism, such as <b>sperm</b> <b>competition.</b>|$|E
5|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} is {{considered}} overall sexually monomorphic, but seasonally fluctuating sexual dimorphism {{in terms of}} body mass has been recorded. While the body mass of both sexes fluctuates over the year {{as a function of}} food availability, being highest in the rainy season, the differing behavioral repertoires of the sexes lead to sex-specific patterns in this fluctuation. For example, male body mass increases prior to the mating season due to a substantial increase in testes volume that likely enhances the males' success in <b>sperm</b> <b>competition.</b>|$|E
5|$|The king grows only {{slightly}} larger after initial mating {{and continues to}} mate with the queen for life (a termite queen can live between 30 to 50years); this {{is very different from}} ant colonies, in which a queen mates once with the male(s) and stores the gametes for life, as the male ants die shortly after mating. If a queen is absent, a termite king produces pheromones which encourage the development of replacement termite queens. As the queen and king are monogamous, <b>sperm</b> <b>competition</b> does not occur.|$|E
40|$|Competition among gametes for {{fertilization}} imposes strong selection. For external fertilizers, this selective pressure {{extends to}} eggs for which spawning conditions {{can range from}} <b>sperm</b> limitation (<b>competition</b> among eggs) to sexual conflict (overabundance of competing sperm toxic to eggs). Yet existing fertilization models ignore dynamics that can alter the functional nature of gamete interactions. These factors include attraction of sperm to eggs, egg crowding effects or other nonlinearities in per capita rates of sperm-egg interaction. Such processes potentially allow egg concentrations to drastically affect viable fertilization probabilities. I experimentally tested whether such egg effects occur using the urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and parameterized a newly derived model of fertilization dynamics and existing models modified to include such interactions. The experiments revealed that at low sperm concentrations, eggs compete for sperm while at high sperm concentrations eggs cooperatively reduce abnormal fertilization (a proxy for polyspermy). I show that these observations are consistent with declines in the per capita rate at which sperm and eggs interact as eggs increase in density. The results suggest a fitness trade-off of egg release during spawning: as sperm range from scarce to superabundant, interactions among eggs transition from highly competitive to cooperative in terms of viable fertilization probabilities.

40|$|Abstract: Little {{is known}} about the effect on {{spermiogenesis}} induced by microcystin-leucine arginine (MC-LR), even though such data are very important to better elucidate reproductive health. In the current work, with the aid of nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as an animal model, we investigated the defects on spermiogenesis induced by MC-LR. Our results showed that MC-LR exposure induced sperm morphology abnormality and caused severe defects of sperm activation, trans-activation, <b>sperm</b> behavior and <b>competition.</b> Additionally, the expression levels of spe- 15 were significantly decreased in C. elegans exposed to MC-LR lower than 16. 0 μg/L, while the expression levels of spe- 10 and fer- 1 could be significantly lowered in C. elegans even exposed to 1. 0 μg/L of MC-LR. Therefore, the present study reveals that MC-LR can induce adverse effects on spermiogenesis, and those defects of sperm functions may be induced by the decreases of spe- 10, spe- 15 and fer- 1 gene expressions in C. elegans...|$|R
40|$|Females are {{typically}} considered the “choosier ” sex, however males may express {{a great deal}} choice under certain circumstances (<b>sperm</b> limitation and <b>competition,</b> parental investment, and resource limitation, etc.). Despite the strong effects of predation risk observed on female choice, {{few studies have examined}} to role of risk on shaping male mate choice. Herein we reviewed the literature on male mate choice and predation risk. We then presented the results of a study of the effects of varying levels of predation risk on the male mate choice in sailfin mollies (Poecilia latipinna). The presence of a predator (at both high and low levels of predation risk) had no affect on the overall levels of male receptivity. Predation risk also did not affect the degree to which males preferred to associate with a conspecific female over a heterospecific, sexual parasite, the amazon molly (Poecilia formosa). In the absence of predation risk, however, males did show a significant preference for displaying to amazon mollies. This preference was extinguished at both levels of predation risk. These results indicate that, if anything, the presence of predation risk makes males less choosy about which female they choose to court...|$|R
5|$|Males within Palaeognathae (with the {{exception}} of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with {{the exception}} of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to <b>sperm</b> <b>competition.</b> When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.|$|E
5|$|Among harem-holding species, {{the adult}} females mate only with their harem stallion, while in other species, mating is more {{promiscuous}} and the males have larger testes for <b>sperm</b> <b>competition.</b> Estrous in female equines lasts 5–10 days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing muscus, and a swollen, everted labia. In addition, estrous females will stand with their hind legs spread {{and raise their}} tails when {{in the presence of}} a male. Males assess the female's reproductive state with the flehmen response and the female will solicit mating by backing in. Length of gestation varies by species, it is roughly 11 to 13 months, and most mares will come into estrus again within a few days after foaling, depending on conditions. Usually, only a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour. Within a few weeks, foals will attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for 8–13 months. Species in arid habitats, like the Grévy's zebra, have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sperm</b> <b>competition</b> theory: Testosterone {{levels are}} shown to {{increase}} {{as a response to}} previously neutral stimuli when conditioned to become sexual in male rats. This reaction engages penile reflexes (such as erection and ejaculation) that aid in <b>sperm</b> <b>competition</b> when more than one male is present in mating encounters, allowing for more production of successful sperm and a higher chance of reproduction.|$|E
40|$|In {{structured}} populations, {{competition for}} reproductive opportunities should be relaxed among related males. The few tests of this prediction often neglect {{the fact that}} sexual selection acts through multiple mechanisms, {{both before and after}} mating. We performed experiments to study the role of within-group male relatedness across pre- and postcopulatory mechanisms of sexual selection in social groups of red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, in which two related males and one unrelated male competed over females unrelated to all the males. We confirm theoretical expectations that, after controlling for male social status, competition over mating was reduced among related males. However, this effect was contrasted by other sexual selection mechanisms. First, females biased male mating in favor of the unrelated male, and might also favor his inseminations after mating. Second, males invested more -rather than fewer- <b>sperm</b> in postcopulatory <b>competition</b> with relatives. A number of factors may contribute to explain this counterintuitive pattern of sperm allocation, including trade-offs between male investment in pre- vs postcopulatory competition, differences in the relative relatedness of pre- vs. postcopulatory competitors, and female bias in sperm utilization in response to male relatedness. Collectively, these results reveal that within-group male relatedness may have contrasting effects in different mechanisms of sexual selection...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn parasitoids, {{the size}} of the adult is {{influenced}} by the size and quality of the host in which it develops. Body size is generally positively correlated with several adult fitness proxies (fecundity, longevity, and mating capacity). The initial resources available to an individual can influence gamete production (sperm and oocytes), and the number and quality of gametes produced directly influence the expected fitness of both males and females. Gamete production in relation to adult body size was quantified in Trichogramma euproctidis (Girault) (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae), a short-lived egg parasitoid of lepidopteran species. To avoid host quality variation, male and female parasitoids of different body sizes were produced using superparasitism by allowing mated and virgin female parasitoids to oviposit on Trichoplusia ni Hu¨bner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) eggs. Seminal vesicles and ovaries of their offspring were dissected to count oocytes and to measure sperm length and oocytes volume. Tibia length was also measured to estimate body size. The number of oocytes, volume of oocytes, maternal investment index [= (number of oocytes * mean volume of oocytes) ⁄ 10 000] and sperm length were all significantly positively correlated to body size. These results show that initial resources acquired during larval stage induce phenotypic plasticity in gamete production in both male and female T. euproctidis. Whereas number of sperm and oocytes can influence the fitness of males and females through increased mating capacity and fecundity, variation in gamete size (sperm length and oocyte volume) could also affect the fitness of an individual through <b>sperm</b> and larval <b>competition...</b>|$|R
40|$|Male birds {{confront a}} trade off between {{increasing}} the number of offspring they sire and providing parental care. This behavioral tradeoff may be manifested as variation in testis size: larger testes, producing more sperm and testosterone, are advantageous for <b>sperm</b> and mating <b>competition,</b> thus ensuring paternity, yet high levels of plasma testosterone also inhibit parental care. There is good evidence that relative testis size is greater in species in which males compete more intensely to fertilize females, but it remains unclear whether, in turn, smaller testes prevail in species with greater levels of paternal care. Cuckoos provide an opportunity to test for an effect of paternal care on testis size because of the diversity of breeding systems in this family: parasitic species lack parental care altogether, whereas some coucals (Centropodinae) show exclusively or predominantly male care. In addition, coucals have a reduced left testis, which Ligon (1997) suggested may promote male care. We tested the idea that species with more paternal care have smaller testes in a phylogenetic analysis of 18 parasitic and 15 nonparasitic species and, specifically, quantified the reduction of the mass of the left testis in the Pheasant Coucal (Centropus phasianinus). Contrary to expectation, nesting cuckoos had larger testes than parasitic species and coucals compensated the reduction of the left testis by an increase of the right. These findings suggest that plasma testosterone is regulated independently of testis size and paternal care is not associated with testis size in cuckoos.

40|$|AbstractMammalian {{fertilization}} is {{a complex}} multi-step process mediated by different molecules present on both gametes. Epididymal protein CRISP 1, {{a member of the}} Cysteine-RIch Secretory Protein (CRISP) family, was identified by our laboratory and postulated to participate in both sperm–zona pellucida (ZP) interaction and gamete fusion by binding to egg-complementary sites. To elucidate the functional role of CRISP 1 in vivo, we disrupted the Crisp 1 gene and evaluated the effect on animal fertility and several sperm parameters. Male and female Crisp 1 −/− animals exhibited no differences in fertility compared to controls. Sperm motility and the ability to undergo a spontaneous or progesterone-induced acrosome reaction were neither affected in Crisp 1 −/− mice. However, the level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation was clearly lower in mutant sperm than in controls. In vitro fertilization assays showed that Crisp 1 −/− sperm also exhibited a significantly reduced ability to penetrate both ZP-intact and ZP-free eggs. Moreover, when ZP-free eggs were simultaneously inseminated with Crisp 1 +/+ and Crisp 1 −/− <b>sperm</b> in a <b>competition</b> assay, the mutant sperm exhibited a greater disadvantage in their fusion ability. Finally, the finding that the fusion ability of Crisp 1 −/− sperm was further inhibited by the presence of CRISP 1 or CRISP 2 during gamete co-incubation, supports that another CRISP cooperates with CRISP 1 during fertilization and might compensate for its lack in the mutant mice. Together, these results indicate that CRISP proteins are players in the mammalian fertilization process. To our knowledge this is the first knockout mice generated for a CRISP protein. The information obtained might have important functional implications for other members of the widely distributed and evolutionarily conserved CRISP family...|$|R
40|$|Drosophila melanogaster male {{accessory}} gland proteins (Acps) {{that are}} transferred in the ejaculate with <b>sperm</b> mediate post–mating <b>competition</b> for fertilizations between males. The actions of Acps include effects on oviposition and ovulation, receptivity and sperm storage. Two Acps that modulate egg production are Acp 26 Aa (ovulin) and Acp 70 A (the sex peptide). Acp 26 Aa acts {{specifically on the}} process of ovulation (the release of mature eggs from the ovaries), which is initiated 1. 5 h after mating. In contrast, sperm storage can take as long as 6 – 9 h to complete. Initial ovulations after matings by virgin females will therefore occur before all sperm are fully stored and the extra eggs initially laid as a result of Acp 26 Aa transfer are expected to be inefficiently fertilized. Acp 26 Aa–mediated release of existing eggs should not cause a significant energetic cost or lead to a decrease in female lifespan assuming, as seems likely, that the energetic cost of egg laying comes from de novo egg synthesis (oogenesis) rather than from ovulation. We tested these predictions using Acp 26 Aa 1 mutant males that lack Acp 26 Aa but are normal for other Acps and Acp 26 Aa 2 males that transfer a truncated but fully functional Acp 26 Aa protein. Females mating with Acp 26 Aa 2 (truncation) males that received functional Acp 26 Aa produced significantly more eggs following their first matings than did mates of Acp 26 Aa 1 (null) males. However, as predicted above, these extra eggs, which were laid as a result of Acp 26 Aa transfer to virgin females, showed significantly lower egg hatchability. Control experiments indicated that this lower hatchability was due to lower rates of fertilization at early post–mating times. There was no drop in egg hatchability in subsequent non–virgin matings. In addition, as predicted above, females that did or did not receive Acp 26 Aa did not differ in survival, lifetime fecundity or lifetime progeny, indicating that Acp 26 Aa transfer does not represent a significant energetic cost for females and does not contribute to the survival cost of mating. Acp 26 Aa appears to remove a block to oogenesis by causing the clearing out of existing mature eggs and, thus, indirectly allowing oogenesis to be initiated immediately after mating. The results show that subtle processes coordinate the stimulation of egg production and sperm storage in mating pairs...|$|R
25|$|Others {{have argued}} that the {{practice}} of traumatic insemination may have been an adaptation for males to circumvent female resistance to mating to eliminate courtship time, allowing one male to inseminate many mates when contact between them is brief; or that it evolved as a new development in the <b>sperm</b> <b>competition</b> as a means to deposit sperm as close to the ovaries as possible.|$|E
25|$|In organisms, sexual {{selection}} extends past differential reproduction to affect sperm composition, <b>sperm</b> <b>competition,</b> and ejaculate size. Males of C. lectularius allocate 12% of their sperm and 19% of their seminal fluid per mating. Due to these findings, Reinhard et. al proposed that multiple mating {{is limited by}} seminal fluid and not sperm. After measuring ejaculate volume, mating rate and estimating sperm density, Reinhardt et al. showed that mating could be limited by seminal fluid. Despite these advances, the cost difference between ejaculate-dose dependence and mating frequency dependence have not been explored.|$|E
25|$|Human mate {{guarding}} {{refers to}} behaviours employed by {{both males and}} females with the aim of maintaining reproductive opportunities and sexual access to a mate. It involves discouraging the current mate from abandoning the relationship whilst also warding off intrasexual (same sex) rivals. It has been observed in nonhuman animals, such as baboons (see <b>sperm</b> <b>competition),</b> as well as humans. Sexual jealousy {{is one of the main}} causes of mate guarding behaviour. Both males and females use different strategies to retain a mate and there is evidence that suggests resistance to mate guarding also exists.|$|E
25|$|A female jewel spider can {{mate with}} {{multiple}} males during a single reproductive cycle. If given the chance, the female will still readily mate with other males shortly after a successful mating. To prevent <b>sperm</b> <b>competition,</b> the successful male will defend the female shortly {{before and after}} mating. It actively drives away other rival males until the female enters a refractory period and ceases to be receptive to further matings. This usually happens an hour to a day after a successful mating, during which the female will herself aggressively attack and drive away all courting males.|$|E
25|$|When {{queen cell}} {{construction}} begins in late August to early September, {{it is in}} the male’s best interest to mate with a queen and produce a gyne. Similar wasp species illustrate workers that help their own kin or harm nonrelatives from growing as a gyne. Thus, reproductive competition occurs so that the genes of specific subfamilies can be passed on and survive. However, no evidence of reproductive competition exists within V. maculifrons colonies. Although a second male may occasionally attempt to grasp a queen immediately after copulation with another male, postcopulatory <b>sperm</b> <b>competition</b> is not common. In addition, reproductive skew among males is low.|$|E
25|$|During high {{outbreak}} densities, some males, called “hangers,” {{change their}} copulation behavior. They do not attach physically to the branch while mating, which {{allows them to}} mate longer and counteract their mate’s efforts to reject them. This behavior increases the percentage of eggs they fertilize as they delay their mated female from remating and reduce number of potential mates the female can have. This hanging behavior does not appear at low population densities, presumably {{because it is more}} energetically costly and more conspicuous, since it can attract more males that can potentially interfere in the copulation process. As a result, males only exhibit this behavior when they are trying to prolong mating to reduce <b>sperm</b> <b>competition.</b>|$|E
25|$|Males of V. maculifrons tend to form loose aggregations, {{resembling}} leks, during mating. In one area, hundreds {{to thousands}} of males patrol prominent trees and bushes by constantly flying around them. Males typically patrol large areas randomly, rather than limiting to a few trees. If a male sees a female while patrolling, he flies closer to the female in a zigzag fashion and stops on a nearby leaf. This then allows the male to climb onto the female’s gaster from behind. Other males {{do not try to}} approach an ongoing copulation, but a male might try to copulate immediately after. If a second mating occurs, <b>sperm</b> <b>competition</b> may favor the second male. As a result, males can prevent competition from another male by elongating copulation.|$|E
25|$|Many reptile species also {{demonstrate}} polyandry, {{especially among}} members of the tortoise family (Testudinidae). Through polyandry and long-term sperm storage, recent studies have found evidence for the ability of female tortoises to produce clutches of eggs that demonstrate multiple paternity. Predictably, these hatchlings showed an increase in genetic variability compared to those sired by a single male. Potential for multiple paternity within a clutch is primarily a result of sperm storage across reproductive cycles, since studies have confirmed the presence of multiple males' sperm in the female tortoise reproductive tract simultaneously. As a result of clutches with greater variation in paternal genes and increased <b>sperm</b> <b>competition,</b> females can maximize both the genetic quality and number of offspring. Multiple paternities within a single clutch is therefore considered an effective strategy to increase the reproductive success and fitness of female tortoises.|$|E
25|$|For humans, {{sexuality}} {{has important}} social functions: it creates physical intimacy, bonds and hierarchies among individuals, besides ensuring biological reproduction. Sexual desire or libido, is {{experienced as a}} bodily urge, often accompanied by strong emotions such as love, ecstasy and jealousy. The significance of sexuality in the human species is reflected {{in a number of}} physical features among them hidden ovulation, the evolution of external scrotum and penis suggesting <b>sperm</b> <b>competition,</b> the absence of an os penis, permanent secondary sexual characteristics and the forming of pair bonds based on sexual attraction as a common social structure. Contrary to other primates that often advertise estrus through visible signs, human females do not have a distinct or visible signs of ovulation, plus they experience sexual desire outside of their fertile periods. These adaptations indicate that the meaning of sexuality in humans is similar to that found in the bonobo, and that the complex human sexual behavior has a long evolutionary history.|$|E
25|$|Populations of {{salamanders}} tend to {{be heavily}} male-biased, which results in a higher number of males vying {{for access to the}} lesser number of females. Males will use different tactics {{in an effort to keep}} other males away from the female of interest and ensure their own paternity and reproductive success, such as sexual defense, which is used to steal other males spermatophore, which may have already deposited into the female, and sexual interference, when a male pushes the female away from another courting male, such as sperm capping, whereby a competing male lays his spermatophore directly on top of those previously deposited by another male. Females also participate in sexual interference: a rival female places herself between the courting male and the female he is courting, and attempts to engage the male in their own courtship dance, a tactic for avoiding <b>sperm</b> <b>competition.</b> The male removes the sperm from a female who had mated with a previous male: many species of salamanders will remove the spermatophore from the previous male and insert his own; thus, ensuring his paternity.|$|E
25|$|When {{males are}} fully mature {{they leave their}} webs {{to search for a}} {{suitable}} female, often using web characteristics to identify potential mates. Females are most likely to mate directly after their final molt at the beginning of adulthood and later in adulthood when they are feeding. There are often multiple males attempting to court the same female and thus competition for territory on the web occurs but is rarely physical as smaller males surrender area to larger ones. When males approach females they are often feeding, allowing the males to get closer without an aggressive response and also meaning the female is not moving. On approach the male makes himself known by tapping on a web strand to ensure the female is amenable before proceeding to mate. When met with aggression males will stop approaching and remain in the same location until the female relaxes or they retreat. Females engage in multiple mating but there is no benefit to the offspring as a result of this, however the energy cost of repelling a male is higher than that of allowing him to copulate. As a result of this <b>sperm</b> <b>competition</b> occurs through males altering the duration of mating as well as the frequency, longer mating is proportional to a greater likelihood of success. Sexual cannibalism is uncommon in Nephila as a result of male mating behaviours. By copulating when females are immobile after molting or inactive due to feeding the males increase their chances of survival. Males also approach {{on the opposite side of}} the web to the female making it more difficult to be caught. Sexual cannibalism does still occur and generally is more common in larger males and from older females.|$|E

An alternative to the <b>sperm</b> <b>competition</b> function is that genital mutilation might allow males to more rapidly escape and avoid being cannibalized after mating, although this function is thought to be unlikely in Unicorn since there are no significant size differences between sexes, and cannibalism is more common when females are much larger than males.
