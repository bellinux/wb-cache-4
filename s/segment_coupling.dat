40|$|Previously it was {{suggested}} that the reason for the superior performance, in terms of both reactivity and avoidance of loss of configuration in peptide coupling observed for 7 -HOAt over HOBt or 4 -HOAt was due to the involvement of a cyclic transition state at the stage of the key intermediate, the active ester [J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1993, 115, 4397]. Synthesis of the two remaining isomers, the 5 - and the 6 -compounds, and examination of the reactivity of all four isomers has added further evidence in support of this theory. For example, upon conversion to the corresponding active esters, it was found that in reactions with amines, the 7 -derivative stands out as being the most reactive. Similarly when used as additive for <b>segment</b> <b>coupling</b> {{in the presence of a}} carbodiimide only the 7 -isomer provides for low-racemization coupling whereas the 4 -, 5 - and 6 -HOAt derivatives show results which are similar to those of HOBt. Finally in the case of a reaction for which neighboring group effects are not pertinent, such as S N 2 displacement on the methyl group of the four isomeric O-methyl ethers, the order of reactivity appears to parallel the pKa data with the 4 -isomer being more reactive than the 7 -isomer. ...|$|E

40|$|Chronic HBV {{infection}} {{is the leading}} cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Synthetic peptides derived from the N-terminus of the large HBV envelope protein (L-protein) have been shown to efficiently block HBV entry. Myr-HBVpreS/ 2 - 78, the parent compound of these drugs, inhibits human HBV infection in vitro and in vivo. An efficient synthesis is required, as these peptides constitute a novel class of anti HBV drugs. Consequently, the solid phase synthesis of the N-terminal 77 amino acids of the viral L-protein was studied in detail. The peptide was N-terminally myristoylated to resemble the natural, postranslationally modified protein. The synthesis was monitored using the Fmoc cleavage pattern of the solid phase synthesis on a standard peptide synthesizer and by LC-MS analyses of the arising side products. “Difficult sequences” in the positions 42 - 47 of the peptide sequence complicate the efficient synthesis of the 77 -mer peptide HBVpreS/ 2 - 78. Attempts were undertaken to optimize the synthesis by heating, double coupling or the use of pseudoproline dipeptides. HPLC-MS analyses showed that the efficiency of the synthesis could be increased best by temperature elevation. This resulted in a higher purity of the crude product after solid phase synthesis. It was possible to minimize the occurrence of side products due to the positive effects related to higher reaction temperature.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} between gaze control, body <b>segment</b> <b>coupling,</b> and foot pressure patterns during walking, and discusses the resulting implications for both modern humans and our evolution. One of the major changes thought to underlie the transition between Australopithecus and Homo is the decoupling {{of the head and}} shoulders, and trunk and hips. The independent rotation of these segments enables greater control of the torque and free moments resulting from leg swing, and is considered key in the control of bipedal locomotion. Fossil evidence of semicircular canal morphology (Spoor et al., 1994) also indicates congruent changes in the vestibular system, which alongside the ability to track moving objects with clarity using smooth pursuit eye movements, are likely to have been fundamental to sensory integration and prioritisation during locomotion. This research therefore assesses how the increased neurological demands of active visual tracking in environments of varying visual complexity, and the artificial recoupling of body segments, impact on foot pressure variability during locomotion in modern man. The results demonstrate that foot pressure variability appears unaffected by larger levels of background visual clutter when tracking using smooth pursuit eye movements - variability appears to be higher in very low levels of visual clutter when there is a relative absence of visual referents. This variability was found to further increase when undertaking a secondary auditory task whilst compared to visual tracking alone. When considering the effects of experimental recoupling of body segments, an increase in foot pressure variability was also observed when compared to natural unrestricted walking, with increased arm and leg swing appearing to compensate for reduced hip and shoulder rotations. These changes in foot pressure variability indicate less consistent gait patterns, and suggest the utilisation of postural correction mechanisms, such as the lateral ankle strategy, to remain stable. The normal ageing process, and resulting joint stiffness and visual, vestibular, and cognitive decline, may be expected to exacerbate such variability increasing the likelihood of falls. This research therefore not only contributes to the understanding of potential locomotor strategies in early hominins, but also has significant implications {{for the safety of the}} elderly and infirm during locomotion, particularly with respect to the built environment...|$|E
40|$|Research {{into the}} {{modelling}} {{and analysis of}} microstrip patch antenna {{have been reported in}} many studies. These include Transmission Line Modelling, Cavity Modelling, Coplanar Multiport Modelling and Full wave Modelling. Since the electromagnetic field elements are time harmonic, the phasor-form of the Maxwell field equations is used. In this thesis results are presented of the research that has been carried out into the segmental approach for the analysis of the microwave patch antennas. The segmental approach includes the "Segmentation" and the "Desegmentation" methods. In the segmentation method two distinct structural forms have been identified, cascade and shunt types. In the cascade type all consecutive segment elements share a common boundary, while for the shunt type, all appended segment elements have no common boundary. In the case of the shunt type structure a generalised input impedance matrix formula, for any number of appended segment elements, has been obtained. For the desegmentation method a generalised input impedance for any number of deleted segment elements, has been obtained. The above research studies have been applied in the design of a circular polarised two corner deleted square patch microstrip antenna with a single feed. For this structure the design involves both square and triangular patch geometries. The overall patch geometry for circular polarised is determined using perturbation analysis to determine the size of the deleted triangular segment elements. New computationally efficient impedance coupling expressions for the interconnecting port impedances on a rectangle, and, on a right angled isosceles triangle shaped antenna patch have been derived. In the determination of the input impedance of the overall antenna structure the coupling impedances constitute the elements of the individual <b>segment</b> <b>coupling</b> matrices. The matrices are used in a general multiport matrix circuit analysis to obtain the input impedance formula. It is established that, where applicable, the desegmentation method is computationally more efficient than the segmentation method. The new results obtained have been applied to the design of a corner deleted square patch antenna, and, the design procedure is fully described. The computer program implementation evaluates the perturbation quantity, and, the antenna input impedance. The structural properties of the coupling matrices, which are used for efficient computation, are described in detail. All the results from the above work show close agreement with full-wave software simulation and practical results. SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH ACHIEVEMENTS: Both segmentation and desegmentation methods have been studied and {{it has been shown that}} the desegmentation approach, when applicable, is in general significantly more computationally efficient. In the segmentation method two structural forms, cascade and shunt have been identified. In the latter case a new generalised input impedance matrix formula has been obtained for any number of appended segment elements.

New computationally efficient expressions for the coupling impedances have been derived and used in test applications. New computationally efficient expressions for the offset input impedance of a linear polarised rectangular patch, and, an isosceles right-angled triangular patch have been derived and experimentally verified.

40|$|Since loss of {{configuration}} at the {{carboxylic acid}} residue during peptide coupling {{remains one of}} the most challenging problems in peptide synthesis whether one is concerned with stepwise or convergent synthesis, a main focus of the present work was to find an approach to overcome this difficulty. A first attempt involved an examination of the Fm group as a backbone protectant for two reasons. First, since the Fm group 43 precludes oxazolone formation it was expected that Fm amino acids could be substituted for Fmoc acids in stepwise solid phase syntheses while eliminating any chance for loss of configuration. Second, if an Fm group were introduced at the C-terminal position of a peptide segment it was expected that such segments would undergo coupling with the N-terminal amino group of a second segment without loss of chirality. Initial attention was paid to this aspect of the convergent approach to peptide synthesis. An appropriate segment was synthesized and some tests were conducted which showed loss of configuration to be minimal. Unfortunately however it was found that the synthesis of the appropriate Fm-backbone protected peptides proved to be difficult because of the large size of the Fm residue. This problem led to an examination of methods to overcome these slow coupling reactions. One of the methods examined involved the synthesis of the indazole analog 194 of HOAt 84 since it was expected that removal of one of the triazole N-atoms should allow the corresponding HATU-like uronium/guanidinium coupling species to be more efficient in directing the coupling process. A method for the synthesis of 7 -aza-N-hydroxyindazole 208 was developed and the structure of the new compound established by normal methods which included a definitive X-ray structural analysis. Unfortunately it proved to be impossible to convert 208 into a stand-alone analog of HATU 99 and when 208 was used as an additive results were not encouraging. Therefore we abandoned the possible use of 208 and spent time on the development of some theoretically interesting pyrazine analogs of HOAt. Unfortunately these materials proved difficult to synthesize and this line of attack was dropped. At the time of this development we were engaged in trying to develop optimized synthetic routes to O-HAPyU 241 a reagent more effective than either N-HAPyU 242 or N-HATU 48 for coupling reactions, but which was only available in very low yield via standard methods. One of the methods examined involved study of the very fast reaction between the potassium salt of HOAt and the chlorouronium salt BTCFH 248. In this reaction the initially formed species is O-HAPyU 241 but this compound rapidly undergoes base-catalysed isomerization to the less reactive N-HAPyU 242. By working quickly it was hoped to be able to isolate the more reactive O-isomer. While carrying out these studies it occurred to us that this might be a general technique for optimizing other ordinary coupling reactions which involve the use of O-HATU 99 b and O-HBTU 99 a. All such O-substituted reagents are sensitive to reaction conditions and are quickly isomerized to the corresponding N-isomers. Thus the superior properties of the O-derivatives are lost. By generating these O-forms in situ we hoped for better results. In fact we were pleasantly surprised to find that precisely such results were observed. Indeed when tested on our standard models for examining the loss of chirality in <b>segment</b> <b>coupling</b> the new methods were remarkably more efficient than the standard techniques. For example in one case leading to a tripeptide 212 via [2 + 1] coupling the older technique always gave 5 - 10 % of the LDL-isomer whereas our newer method can achieve this coupling with absolutely no loss of configuration. Several models were examined, even some extremely difficult ones and in all cases significant improvements were observed. These methods were also applied to solid phase syntheses of longer peptides and here again the results were superior. Thus we believe the new method represents a remarkable, even astonishing, improvement over previously described methods. ...|$|E

40|$|Backbone N-methylation is {{becoming}} an increasingly important tool in peptide drug design, and has been widely used to optimize the activity and selectivity of peptide ligands {{as a result of}} conformational modulation. However, no systematic research has been conducted on modifying the peptide backbone with other N-alkyl substituents. The present doctoral thesis is aimed at introducing novel N-substituents into peptides, and comparing the conformational and biological properties of the resulting N-substituted peptides with those of their N-Me homologues. In a first project, we studied the effect of replacing backbone N-Me groups by an N-triethylene glycol (N-TEG) chain on hydrophobicity and conformation. For that, we chose Sansalvamide A peptide as a model, and we incorporated N-Me and N-TEG amino acids at the different positions of its cyclopentapeptide structure. We found that Fmoc-protected amino acids bearing the N-TEG group [i. e. N-CH 2 CH 2 (OCH 2 CH 2) 2 OCH 3] can be easily prepared in solution, and they are straightforward to incorporate into a resin-bound peptide. The acylation of N-TEG amines can be achieved in solid-phase by activating the following amino acid with triphosgene. In this way, N-TEG peptides are accessible by the same synthetic repertoire as that already established for N-Me peptides. Comparison of NMR data of our N-TEG vs. N-Me analogs gives evidence of similar conformational preferences for those peptides with the same N-alkylation pattern. Furthermore, comparison of their chromatographic retention parameters indicates that the incorporation of an N-TEG chain into a peptide provides a higher hydrophobicity than an N-Me group. In a second study, we chose Cilengitide as model peptide, and we replaced its backbone N-Me group by various N-oligoethylene glycol (N-OEG) chains of increasing size: namely N-OEG 2, N-OEG 11, and N-OEG 23, which are respectively composed of 2, 11 and 23 ethylene oxide monomer units. The N-OEG 2 cyclopeptide analog was straightforward to synthesize in solid-phase, using the same methodology as for the N-TEG analogs of Sansalvamide A peptide. The syntheses of the N-OEG 11 and N-OEG 23 cyclopeptides are hampered due to the increased steric hindrance exerted by the N-substituent, and could only be achieved by <b>segment</b> <b>coupling,</b> which takes place with epimerization and thus requires extensive product purification. The different N-OEG cyclopeptide analogs and the parent peptide were compared with respect to biological activity and lipophilicity. The N-OEG 2 analog displayed the same capacity as Cilengitide to inhibit integrin-mediated adhesion of HUVEC and DAOY cells to their ligands vitronectin and fibrinogen. The N-OEG 11 and N-OEG 23 analogs also inhibited cell adhesion, though with less potency. Thus, replacement of the backbone N-Me group of Cilengitide by a short N-OEG chain provides a more lipophilic analog with a similar biological activity. Upon increasing the size of the N-OEG chain, lipophilicity is enhanced, but synthetic yields drop and the longer polymer chains may impede receptor binding. On the basis of our finding that N-alkyl chains exert similar conformational constraints as a backbone N-Me group when incorporated into a cyclic peptide, we studied the N-(4 -azidobutyl) group as a linker to permit conjugation in peptides that lack derivatizable groups (i. e. N-terminus, C-terminus, and side-chain functionalities). We developed a robust strategy for the introduction of this linker into a peptide using standard solid-phase peptide synthesis techniques. With this methodology, we synthesized an analog of Cilengitide in which its backbone N-Me group was replaced by the N-(4 -azidobutyl) group. This N-(4 -azidobutylated) analog was used to prepare several conjugates with a polydisperse PEG chain (2 KDa), showing that our linker allows conjugation either via click chemistry or -after azide reduction- via acylation or reductive alkylation. This linker is orthogonal to protecting groups and resins commonly used in peptide chemistry, and chemically inert {{to a wide range of}} functionalities. NMR data indicated that Cilengitide and its N-(4 -azidobutylated) analog have the same backbone conformation. Therefore, substitution of a backbone N-Me group by the N-(4 -azidobutyl) linker is a valuable strategy to provide a reactive site for the attachment of molecules whilst preserving the original peptide sequence and conformation. In summary, we have found that peptides bearing larger N-substituents than an N-Me group can be easily synthesized, but difficulties arise upon increasing the size of N-alkyl group. For Sansalvamide A peptide and Cilengitide, replacement of a backbone N-Me group by a short N-OEG chain resulted in analogs with similar biological activity and conformational features. This concept was then employed for the design of the N-(4 -azidobutyl) linker, which allows bioorthogonal conjugation of a desired molecule with minimal perturbation of a target peptide structure. Considering the high abundance of N-Me groups in biologically active peptides, we contend that modification at this position is a feasible alternative to introduce chemical diversity or alter pharmacologically important parameters when modification at any other position of the peptide is not wished or possible. En química medicinal, la N-metilació de l’esquelet peptídic s’ha utilitzat àmpliament per a imposar restriccions conformacionals en pèptids i així optimitzar la seva activitat i selectivitat. D’altra banda, la introducció de grups N-Me en pèptids d’interès terapèutic també és una estratègia per a millorar la seva biodisponibilitat, ja que els pèptids N-metilats són més hidrofòbics, més resistents al trencament proteolític, i -en general- més permeables a través de les membranes biològiques. No obstant, s’han descrit molts pocs exemples en els quals s’hagi modificat l’esquelet peptídic amb d’altres grups N-alquil. Això es pot atribuir a la dificultat d’acilar residus N-alquilats amb grups més grans que N-Me, degut al major impediment estèric. L’objectiu principal de la present tesi ha estat explorar la viabilitat sintètica d’introduir nous N-substituents en pèptids, i comparar les propietats d’aquests nous pèptids N-substituïts amb les dels seus homòlegs N-metilats. En aquesta tesi demostrem que els pèptids modificats amb una cadena de N-trietilenglicol (N-TEG) es poden preparar amb mètodes ja establerts per a la síntesi de pèptids N-metilats. En incrementar la llargada de la cadena de N-oligoetilenglicol (N-OEG), l’acoblament sobre el residu N-alquilat no és viable en fase sòlida, però es pot aconseguir solució utilitzant un clorur d’àcid. Per a dos ciclopèptids model, vam sintetitzar diversos N-OEG anàlegs, i vam trobar que la introducció del grup N-OEG augmenta la hidrofobicitat de forma proporcional a la llargada de la cadena. També vam trobar que el reemplaçament del grup N-Me present en aquests pèptids per una cadena curta de N-OEG provoca una mínima pertorbació de la seva conformació i activitat biològica. En base aquesta observació, vam estudiar el grup N-(4 -azidobutil) com a linker per a permetre la conjugació en pèptids que no poseeixen grups funcionals derivatitzables. Demostrem que el grup N-(4 -azidobutil) es pot introduir en un pèptid utilitzant mètodes estàndard de síntesi en fase sòlida, i que la substitució d’un grup N-Me present en un pèptid pel nostre linker no altera la conformació del pèptid. També demostrem que grup N-(4 -azidobutil) permet la conjugació mitjançant diverses transformacions químiques. Es tracta d’un linker ortogonal a la majoria de grups protectors emprats en síntesi de pèptids, i químicament inert a una gran varietat de grups funcionals. En conclusió, la modificació de l’esquelet peptídic amb d’altres N-substituents més grans que N-Me és factible, però sorgeixen dificultats sintètiques en incrementar el tamany del grup N-alquil. Considerant que el grup N-Me es troba present en nombrosos pèptids biològicament actius, la seva substitució per d’altres entitats químiques és una alternativa viable per a introduir diversitat estructural o alterar propietats farmacològiques importants quan no és possible o no interessa modificar d’altres posicions d’un pèptid...|$|E

This program {{is capable of}} analyzing any specified RTG design under {{a wide range of}} transient as well as steady-state operating conditions. The feasibility of a new concept for the design of segmented (or single-phase) thermoelectric couples was demonstrated. A SiGe-PbTe <b>segmented</b> <b>couple</b> involving pressure contacted junctions at the intermediate- and hot-junction temperatures was successfully encapsulated in a hermetically sealed bellows enclosure. This bellows-encapsulated couple was operated between a hot- and cold-junction temperature of 1200 K and 450 K, respectively, with a measured energy conversion efficiency of 7. 6 + or -. 5 per cent. An experimental study of selected sublimation barrier schemes revealed that a significant reduction in the sublimation rate of p-type PbTe could be achieved by using multiple layers of SiO 2 fibers.

In an ADS basic research program supported by Chinese government, a long-pulse intense-beam RFQ accelerator will be built at IHEP, Beijing, as the means to master the key technology in a CW RFQ. At present we have finished the design of the RFQ with pulse beam current of 50 mA, output energy of 3. 5 MeV and length of 4. 7 m with two <b>segments</b> <b>coupled</b> by a resonant coupling cell.

40|$|Eph {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases (RTKs) mediate numerous developmental processes. Their {{activity is}} regulated by auto-phosphorylation on two tyrosines within the juxtamembrane segment (JMS) immediately N-terminal to the kinase domain (KD). Here, we probe the molecular details of Eph kinase activation through mutational analysis, X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy on auto-inhibited and active EphB 2 and EphA 4 fragments. We {{show that a}} Tyr 750 Ala gain-of-function mutation in the KD and JMS phosphorylation independently induce disorder of the JMS and its dissociation from the KD. Our X-ray analyses demonstrate that this occurs without major conformational changes to the KD and with only partial ordering of the KD activation segment. However, conformational exchange for helix αC in the N-terminal KD lobe and for the activation <b>segment,</b> <b>coupled</b> with increased inter-lobe dynamics, is observed upon kinase activation in our NMR analyses. Overall, our results suggest that a change in inter-lobe dynamics and the sampling of catalytically competent conformations for helix αC and the activation segment rather than a transition to a static active conformation underlies Eph RTK activation...|$|R

40|$|Forces {{acting on}} the S 4 {{segments}} of the channel, the voltage-sensing structures, are analyzed. The conformational change in the Na channel is modeled as a helix-coil transition in the four S 4 <b>segments,</b> <b>coupled</b> to the membrane voltage by electrical forces. In the model, repulsions between like charges make the S 4 segment unstable, but field-dependent forces hold it in an alpha-helix configuration at resting potential. At threshold depolarization, the S 4 helices cooperatively expand into random coils, breaking the hydrogen bonds connecting adjacent loops of the alpha helices. Exposed electron pairs left on the carbonyl oxygens constitute sites at which cations can bind selectively. The first hydrogen bond to break is at the channel exterior, then the second breaks, and so on in a zipper-like motion along the entire segment. The Na+ ions hop from one site to the next until all H bonds are broken and all sites are filled with ions. This completes the pathway over which the permeant ions move through the channel, driven by the electrochemical potential difference across the membrane. This microscopic mechanism {{is consistent with the}} thermodynamic explanation of ion-channel gating previously formulated as the ferroelectric-superionic transition hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the thermal breakage of a tethered polymer chain of discrete <b>segments</b> <b>coupled</b> by Morse potentials under constant tensile stress. The chain dynamics {{at the onset}} of fracture is studied analytically by Kramers-Langer multidimensional theory and by extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations in 1 D- and 3 D-space. Comparison with simulation data in one- and three dimensions demonstrates that the Kramers-Langer theory provides good qualitative description of the process of bond-scission as caused by a collective unstable mode. We derive distributions of the probability for scission over the successive bonds along the chain which reveal the influence of chain ends on rupture in good agreement with theory. The breakage time distribution of an individual bond is found to follow an exponential law as predicted by theory. Special attention is focused on the recombination (self-healing) of broken bonds. Theoretically derived expressions for the recombination time and distance distributions comply with MD observations and indicate that the energy barrier position crossing is not a good criterion for true rupture. It is shown that the fraction of self-healing bonds increases with rising temperature and friction. Comment: 25 pages, 13 picture...|$|R
