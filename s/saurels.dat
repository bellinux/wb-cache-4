5000|$|Jack {{mackerels}} or <b>saurels</b> are marine {{fish in the}} Trachurus genus of {{the family}} Carangidae. The name of the genus derives from the Greek words trachys ("rough") and oura ("tail"). Some species, such as T. murphyi, are harvested in purse seine nets, and overfishing (harvesting beyond sustainable levels) has sometimes occurred.|$|E

40|$|Steamdistillation of Japanese <b>saurel</b> Trachurus and {{examination}} of the distillate vapor revealed that hydrogen sulfide was detected, and that in amine fraction the contents of amines, especially trimethylamine, in fatty acid fradtion the amounts of the unconfirmed fatty acid and in carbonyl fraction the contents of propion aldehyde and C_ 6 aldehyde increased, accompanying lowering of freshness of Japanese <b>saurel</b> by using gas chromatographic technique. The existence of butyric and valeric acids in acid fraction could not be found.

40|$|In the {{previous}} report it was clarified that the vapor {{phase in the}} distillate of Japanese <b>saurel</b> contained hydrogen sulfide and methanthiol, the amine fraction in the condensed phase contained monomethylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine, the fatty acid fraction contained acetic, propionic, butyric, and caprylic acids by using gas chromatographic technique, and the carbonyl fraction contained hexanal. The present study was undertaken to clarify {{the difference in the}} amounts of each volatile fatty acid in Japanese sauel and cuttle fish accompanying lowering of freshness by using gas chromatography. The total amounts of volatile amines and fatty acids increased accompanying lowering of freshness in both Japanese <b>saurel</b> and cuttle fish. In Japanese <b>saurel</b> each amount of acetic, propionic, butyric and caproic acids increased, in cuttle fish the contents of butyric and isovaleric acids also increased, accompanying lowering of freshness.

50|$|Besides just {{rewarding}} Carignan-Salières officers {{by granting}} them seigneurial tenures, the tenure properties served an ulterior purpose.

It was believed that the men of the Carignan-Salières would be the colonists best suited to defend the territories of New France, therefore many of them were given properties on the Richelieu river and other areas prone to attack. These Seigneurs would sub grant land to the men of their companies in order to create an even more thoroughly reinforced zone. <b>Saurel's</b> land would later be known as Sorel-Tracy in Quebec, while Contrecœur's property would later become a region named after himself.|$|R
