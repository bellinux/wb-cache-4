500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want our response to send out the very strong message that this isn't a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> or a token punishment.|$|E

[...] Leslie enjoys herself at the party and, when the beer runs out and the party is about to end, she keeps it going by {{retrieving}} the wine and cheese from the gift basket.

[...] Later, however, she learns April has placed a drunken video of herself drinking the rest of the wine on the site, even though she is only 19. [...] Ron tells Leslie an ethics board has called for a disciplinary hearing with Leslie. [...] Leslie apologizes to the board and defends April, accepting responsibility for the video. [...] As the questions from the board continue, Ron angrily defends Leslie, insisting, [...] "Leslie has never broken a rule in her life, to the point that it's annoying." [...] He abruptly ends the meeting and insists they will have to go through him to give Leslie anything more than a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{fact that}} one man had managed to disrupt {{so much of the}} nation's capital and hold federal law {{enforcement}} officers at bay for two days raised many concerns over the vulnerability of Washington to future terrorist attacks, especially coming mere months after the Beltway sniper attacks and coinciding with the build-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Many criticized the authorities for their passive handling of Watson, as he was even left alone to sleep aboard his tractor during the two-day standoff. Washington Times columnist Tony Blankley wrote that [...] "on the eve of a multi-billion dollar, high-technology war, our security perimeter has been penetrated and downtown traffic has come to a standstill. ... The Park Police should just drag Dwight and his John Deere out of <b>the</b> pond, <b>slap</b> him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> and get ready for the real enemies in our midst."
