40|$|Supply-side <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>reforms</b> {{intended}} to increase employment and delay benefit claiming among older individuals may be frustrated by age discrimination. We test for policy complementarities between these reforms and demand-side efforts to deter age discrimination, specifically studying whether stronger state-level age discrimination protections enhanced {{the impact of}} the 1983 <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>reforms</b> that increased the Full Retirement Age (FRA) and reduced benefits. The evidence indicates that, for older individuals for whom early retirement benefits fell and the FRA increased, stronger state age discrimination protections were associated with delayed benefit claiming and increases in employment, with benefit claiming pushed from 65 to the new FRA, and increased employment after age 62 and age 65 that is then curtailed at the new FRA. ...|$|R
40|$|Before 1982 Mexico’s {{welfare state}} regime was a limited {{conservative}} one that put pri-ority on the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> of organized labor. But following the country’s debt crisis in 1982, this regime {{changed to a}} hybrid liberal model.

This paper examines the characteristics and the policy making of the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>reforms</b> in the 1990 s. The results suggest that underlying these reforms was the restruc-turing {{of the economy and}} the need to cope with the cost of this restructuring. The paper also points out that one of the main factors making possible the rapid execution of the reforms were the weakened political clout of the officialist labor unions due to their steady breakdown during the 1990 s and the increase in the monopolistic power of the state vis-à-vis the position of labor during the negotiations on <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>reforms.</b> I...|$|R

25|$|In April 2006, Erdoğan {{unveiled}} a <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>reform</b> package {{demanded by the}} International Monetary Fund under a loan deal. The move, which Erdoğan {{called one of the}} most radical reforms ever, was passed with fierce opposition. Turkey's three social security bodies were united under one roof, bringing equal health services and retirement benefits for members of all three bodies. The previous system had been criticized for reserving the best healthcare for civil servants and relegating others to wait in long queues. Under the second bill, everyone under the age of 18 years was entitled to free health services, irrespective of whether they pay premiums to any social security organization. The bill also envisages a gradual increase in the retirement age: starting from 2036, the retirement age will increase to 65 by 2048 for both women and men.|$|E
25|$|Critics of Social Security {{claim that}} it gives a low rate of return, {{compared}} to what is obtained through private retirement accounts. For example, critics point out that under the Social Security laws as they existed at that time, several thousand employees of Galveston County, Texas were allowed {{to opt out of}} the Social Security program in the early 1980s, and have their money placed in a private retirement plan instead. While employees who earned $50,000 per year would have collected $1,302 per month in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $6,843 per month. While employees who earned $20,000 per year would have collected $775 per month in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $2,740 per month, at interest rates prevailing in 1996. While some advocates of privatization of Social Security point to the Galveston pension plan as a model for <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>reform,</b> critics point to a GAO report to the House Ways and Means Committee, which indicates that, for low and middle income employees, particularly those with shorter work histories, the outcome may be less favorable.|$|E
25|$|The Deferre Law {{reduced the}} powers of the prefect, set up elected {{regional}} councils, and increased {{the powers of}} local government. The security court was abolished, and measures were introduced to control police harassment. Legal aid was extended, legislation was introduced which effectively combated discrimination against homosexuals, and the traditional powers of the juge d’instruction in the preparation of criminal cases was reduced. The Quillot Law of 1982 provided renters with additional rights in housing matters, while an audiovisual law passed that same year brought an end to the state monopoly of audiovisual broadcasting and established a High Authority to guarantee the independence of public television channels. Laws were passed in 1982 to reform higher education to make the academy more responsive {{to the needs of the}} state. High security wings in prisons were abolished, while <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>reform</b> increased workers’ representation on the bodies that oversaw the management of the social security schemes. In order to make the elite political academy (the ENA) accessible to a wider section of the population, a special entry pathway was established for those who had held trade union or political office. A new health care policy was implemented, which included the abolition of private beds in hospitals, reform of medical training, modernisation of facilities, and the election of the heads of medical services by the entire staff, rather than just by doctors, as had previously been the case. The Mauroy Government also withdrew a ministerial circular issued by the previous government that limited initiatives by regional councils, while a grant was created for the purpose of subsidizing local cultural projects and activities.|$|E
40|$|The {{aging of}} the {{population}} shakes the public finance of pay- as-you-go <b>social</b> <b>security</b> systems.

Allowing for a one-shot budget deficit, earmarked to accommodate the cost of the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>reforms,</b> is shown to facilitate the political-economy transition from a national to a private pension system. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the trends in labor force {{participation}} and transitions to benefit programs of older workers {{in relation to}} health trends as well as recent <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>reforms.</b> Our preliminary conclusions are pessimistic regarding the effect of health improvements on the labor market attachment of older workers since we show that despite the large improvements in the mortality rates among older individuals in Spain, the employment rates of individuals older than fifty-five remain lower than the ones observed in the late 1970 s. Some caution should remain in our conclusions as the evidence on health trends is inconclusive. Regarding the effect of <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>reforms,</b> we find that both the 1997 and the 2002 reform decreased the stock into old-age benefits {{at the cost of}} an increased share of the participation into disability. Finally, we find that there was {{a significant increase in the}} outflow from employment into disability after the 2002 reform. ...|$|R
