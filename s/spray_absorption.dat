40|$|AbstractSpray columns can {{potentially}} be utilized for absorbing CO 2 from large point {{sources such as}} flue gas exhausted by power plants. Low gas phase pressure drop, {{and the lack of}} internals which are susceptible to corrosion, make spray columns well suited for aqueous amine absorption. Design practices for spray columns are highly empirical and application specific. There is a paucity of data on absorption of CO 2 in aqueous amine sprays. Mass transfer data for CO 2 -amine systems is required for robust design of spray columns. Further, the absorption efficiency of sprays is greatly influenced by the surface area of drops, which in turn depends on the droplet size distribution. However, experimental data for droplet size distributions inside aqueous amine sprays is non-existent. Measurement of droplet size distributions is critical in providing a fundamental insight into <b>spray</b> <b>absorption.</b> This work presents molar flux data coupled with droplet size distribution data for CO 2 absorption into Monoethanolamine (MEA) spray. Both the molar flux measurements and the droplet size measurements are made inside a 0. 2 m glass column. The droplet size distributions are measured using a Phase Doppler Interferometer (PDI). Further, a novel method is utilized to quantify the available surface area from the droplet size distribution measurements. The effect of MEA concentration on molar flux, droplet size, and surface area is presented...|$|E
40|$|Osteoporosis {{treatment}} with PTH 1 - 34 injections significantly reduces {{the incidence of}} bone fracture. Potential further reductions in fracture rate should be observed through nasal spray delivery to address the poor compliance associated with patient dislike of repeated PTH 1 - 34 subcutaneous injections. In vitro human osteoblast-like Saos- 2 cell intracellular cAMP levels were used to define PTH 1 - 34 nasal spray formulation bioactivity. The chemically synthesised PTH 1 - 34 had an EC 50 of 0. 76 nM. Absorption enhancers polyethylene glycol (15) -hydroxystearate (Solutol® HS 15), poloxamer 407, chitosan or sodium hyaluronate did not diminish the bioactivity of PTH 1 - 34 within an in vitro cell culture model (p> 0. 05). We also demonstrated {{the effectiveness of the}} transmucosal absorption enhancer Solutol® HS 15 in a nasal spray formulation using a preclinical pharmacokinetic model. In Sprague-Dawley rats without the absorption enhancer the uptake of PTH 1 - 34 into the blood via intranasal delivery produced a Cmax of 2. 1 ± 0. 5 ng/ml compared to 13. 7 ± 1. 6 ng/ml with Solutol® HS 15 enhancer (p= 0. 016) and a Cmax 14. 8 ± 8 ng/ml in subcutaneous injections. Together these data illustrate that the nasal spray formulation bioactivity in vitro is not affected by the nasal <b>spray</b> <b>absorption</b> enhancers investigated, and the Solutol® HS 15 nasal spray formulation had an equivalent pharmacokinetic profile to subcutaneous injection in the rat model. The Solutol® HS 15 formulation therefore demonstrated potential as a PTH 1 - 34 nasal spray formulation for the treatment of osteoporosis...|$|E

However, to accomplish either of these, an increase in both power consumed and operating cost is required. In addition, the physical size of the spray tower will limit the amount of liquid and the size of droplets that can be used.|$|R

As THC/CBD spray is {{indicated}} for MS and potentially advanced cancer pain, the likelihood is high that patients would be receiving different concomitant medications. As such, drug-drug interactions could occur which affect the bioavailability of THC/CBD <b>spray</b> through <b>absorption,</b> metabolism or disposition. In turn this could affect the treatment and adverse events (AEs) experienced by the patient (Chen & Raymond 2006). In some incidences, AEs experienced due to drug-drug interactions can be life-threatening, therefore understanding the mechanisms of these interactions is important so that dosing and safety information can be adjusted accordingly.|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of electrically altering the droplet size distribution and injection cone angle of gas turbine fuel injectors has been investigated. The work {{was carried out}} both in a combustor rig incorporating a T- 56 combustor liner/nozzle and in a non-burning <b>spray</b> optical <b>absorption</b> apparatus into each of which a high voltage electrode could be introduced. Several electrode designs were investigated {{in an effort to}} minimize flameholding and subsequent electrical shot circuiting. Fuels investigated included JP- 4, the design fuel, JET-A, JP- 5, and Diesel Fuel Number 2. Results of the optical experiments indicated reductions in the Sauter Mean Diameter of 7. 7 percent.

40|$|AbstractA {{computer}} model characterizing {{the performance of}} a <b>spray</b> tower oxygen <b>absorption</b> system was developed based on finite difference mass transfer calculations. Performance was assessed in terms of oxygen utilization, transfer efficiency, and economy. Pilot scale tests verified model assumptions and performance predictions. Simulation runs indicated spray tower head and oxygen feed requirements for desired changes in dissolved oxygen (DO) exceeded those required for packed column equipment. Spray tower performance was improved by increasing hydraulic loading from 35 to 85 kg m− 2 s− 1 and by increasing tower height from 1 · 25 to 2 · 50 m. The effluent DO concentration that minimized variable costs of oxygen transfer was lower in the spray tower than in the packed tower, indicating clean water use of the spray tower will be limited to moderate effluent DO requirement applications (DO < 20 mg l− 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine the absorption rates of refrigerant vapour in an aqueous lithium bromide flat-fan sheet for use in absorption air-conditioning systems. The solution flow rates tested ranged from 0. 023 to 0. 054 Â kg/s (84 - 194 Â kg/h), with pressure losses in the injection nozzle of from 40 to 250 Â kPa. The effect of the mass flow rate on both solution residence time and the sheet deformation rate was also analyzed in absorption chambers of a pre-defined length, along with {{the effect of the}} sub-cooling temperature on the amount of vapour absorbed. The downstream evolution of approach to equilibrium factor F was quantified. The mass transfer coefficient values were found to be over 3 Â xÂ  10 - 4 Â m/s. In absorption chambers 100 Â mm long, over 0. 8 Â g/sÂ l of vapour were absorbed per chamber absorption volume. Moreover, about 600 Â g of vapour were absorbed per kJ of solution flow work.

40|$|Abstract. The {{electrostatic}} jet flow {{has been}} widely employed to crop-dusting, painting, fuel spray and combustion, electrostatic painting, dust particles and flue gas removal. In order to investigate the convolution flow structure near the nozzle, discuss the effects of electrostatic voltages on convolution flow form, development and the aggrandizement of droplets mass transfer. PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) was employed to measure and analyze the convolution flow near the nozzle under different voltages, and the velocity vectors and streamlines were gained. Experiment and analysis indicate that convolution flow structure has been existed in electrostatic jet flow brim and the main jet flow section change is inconspicuous with voltages adding; Electrical filed intensity has been enhanced and the droplets convolution flow was picked up with the electrostatic voltages adding. The convolution flow structure could quicken the gas mix into the main jet flow, and enhanced the droplets absorbency. I.

40|$|Characterisation of {{exposure}} levels {{is an essential}} requirement of health risk assessment; however for water exposures other than drinking, few quantitative exposure data exist. Thus, regulatory agencies must use estimates to formulate policy on treatment requirements for non-potable recycled water. We adapted {{the use of the}} swimming pool chemical cyanuric acid as a tracer of recreational water ingestion to permit detection of small water volumes inadvertently ingested from spray exposures. By using solutions of 700 e 1000 mg/L cyanuric acid in an experimental spray exposure scenario, we were able to quantify inadvertent water ingestion in almost 70 % of participants undertaking a 10 min car wash activity using a high pressure <b>spray</b> device. Skin <b>absorption</b> was demonstrated to be negligible under the experimental conditions, and the measured ingestion volumes ranged from 0. 06 to 3. 79 mL. This method could be applied to a range of non-potable water use activities to generate exposure data for risk assessment processes. The availability of such empirical measurements will provide greater assurance to regulatory agencies and industry that potential health risks from exposure to non-potable water supplies are well understood and adequately managed to protect public health...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación SciELOAn ionic {{exchange}} {{high resolution}} liquid chromatography (IE-HPLC) method for determination of cations and anions in interstitial water of sediments, affluent and effluent of dams is proposed in this paper. Cations: Na+, Ca 2 +, K+, and Mg 2 + and anions: Cl-, CO 32 -, NO 3 - and SO 42 - were analyzing by IE-HPLC method. Optimized analytical conditions were validated {{in terms of}} accuracy, recovery and detection limit. The method of flame <b>spray</b> atomic <b>absorption</b> spectrophotometer (AAS) {{was used as an}} additional method for the determination of Ca and Mg. It must be indicated that cations may be analyzed by several analytical methods such as AAS, ICP, etc., but there are not enough methods to analyze anions; IE-HPLC methods are good alternative to determine these ions. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine ions in interstitial water in the affluent and effluent of the Chilean dams Cogotí, Corrales, La Paloma, Rapel and Recoleta in order to determine if the water is suitable for irrigation or human consumption and estimate the effect of dams on water quality. The results indicate that the highest concentrations observed were for the cations: Ca 2 + (mean 43. 5 mgL- 1), Na+ (mean 16. 4 mgL- 1), Mg 2 + (mean 12. 6 mgL- 1), and K+ (mean 2. 3 mgL- 1). The highest concentration of anions was found for CO 32 - (mean 55. 9 mgL- 1); the concentrations of SO 42 -, Cl- and NO 3 - reached 59. 3 mgL- 1, 12. 8 mgL- 1 and 27. 0 mgL- 1, respectively. The results indicate that although the origin of soluble salts is lithogenic, the high concentrations of these salts found in some places indicate anthropogenic effect, either by direct or indirect discharges or by diffuse pollution. These high concentrations may be significant, considering that these waters are used mainly for irrigation, which would affect the quality of agricultural soils irrigated with this moderately saline water...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLow {{durability}} and compressive strength of adobe blocks leads to frequent maintenance problem associated with rural house wall construction. This forms {{the main reason}} of abandonment of vernacular mud housing building technology in rural areas today. The present paper presents an attempt to improve upon the low durability of adobe blocks by addition of natural reinforcement of Grewia Optiva and Pinus Roxburghii which otherwise are treated as waste material in rural areas. Experimental investigations were carried out for cylindrical and cubical stabilized and unstabilized soil samples. Durability tests conducted included wetting and drying test, water absorption and expansion test, sponge water <b>absorption</b> test, <b>spray</b> test, total <b>absorption</b> test, and water strength coefficient tests carried out as per Indian standards and international research. Results indicated that durability of stabilized soil samples increases by 72 % and 68 % for fibers of Grewia Optiva and Pinus Roxburghii as compared with unstabilized soil samples. The results recommend that fibers of Grewia Optiva and Pinus Roxburghii can be advantageously added in adobe blocks for improving durability. This would propagate durable mud housing {{on a large scale}} thereby reducing housing shortage especially in developing countries, economizing use of natural resources, reducing energy consumption during manufacturing of modern construction materials and most importantly provide sustainable way of living...|$|R
40|$|Donald R Taylor Comprehensive Pain Care PC, Marietta, GA, USA Abstract: Breakthrough {{cancer pain}} (BTCP) {{is defined as}} a {{transient}} exacerbation of pain that arises in patients with otherwise controlled persistent pain. BTCP typically has a rapid onset and relatively short duration, but it causes a significant amount of physical and psychological distress for patients. Several rapid-onset fentanyl formulations have been introduced in the USA to replace traditional oral opioids for the treatment of BTCP: a transmucosal lozenge, a sublingual orally disintegrating tablet, a buccal tablet, a buccal soluble film, a pectin nasal spray and, the newest formulation to enter the market, a sublingual spray. This article reviews the six rapid-onset formulations of fentanyl approved in the USA for the management of BTCP with emphasis on describing the published literature on fentanyl sublingual spray. The different fentanyl formulations vary in pharmacokinetic properties and ease of use, but all have a rapid onset and a relatively short duration of analgesia. Fentanyl sublingual <b>spray</b> has demonstrated <b>absorption</b> within 5 minutes of administration, with fentanyl plasma concentrations increasing over the first 30 minutes and remaining elevated for 60 – 90 minutes in pharmacokinetic studies in healthy subjects. Fentanyl sublingual spray shows linear dose proportionality, and changes in the temperature or acidity of the oral cavity do not alter its pharmacokinetic properties. In patients with BTCP, statistically significant pain relief is measurable at 5 minutes after administration of fentanyl sublingual spray, when compared with placebo, with significant pain relief lasting at least 60 minutes after administration. Adverse events are typical of opioid treatment and are considered mild to moderate in intensity. In summary, fentanyl sublingual spray provides rapid onset of analgesia and is a tolerable and effective treatment for BTCP.
