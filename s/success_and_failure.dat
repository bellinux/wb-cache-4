5|$|The Tower of Babble: Sins, Secrets and Successes {{inside the}} CBC is a Canadian non-fiction book written by Richard Stursberg. The {{book is a}} memoir {{detailing}} Stursberg's experience as the vice-president in charge of English services at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) between October 2004 and August 2010. Stursberg was recruited by CBC president Robert Rabinovitch who understood and supported Stursberg's intention to move the CBC's focus more towards producing popular content with <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> defined {{by the number of}} people who watch, rather than awards or critical praise. The book covers a range of topics relating to CBC, including acquiring popular shows, like Little Mosque on the Prairie and Heartland, for CBC Television, modernizing news coverage at CBC News, adjustments to CBC Radio, and CBC Sports losing broadcasting rights to its competitors.|$|E

25|$|With these colonies came vital {{manpower}} – a {{large number}} of African colonial troops, who would form the nucleus of de Gaulle's army. From July to November 1940, the FFF would engage in fighting with troops loyal to Vichy France in Africa, with <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> on both sides.|$|E
25|$|Each {{agency would}} also be reduced to having only one CIO in the agency, who is then {{responsible}} for the <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> of all IT projects in that agency. The bill would also require {{the federal government to}} make use of private sector best practices. The bill was intended to reduce IT procurement related waste. It passed the House in a voice vote on February 25, 2014. In December 2014 it was passed as a section of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} ego {{depletion}} {{do not appear}} to be a product of mood or arousal. In most studies, mood and arousal has not been found to differ between participants who exerted self-control and those who did not. Likewise, mood and arousal was not related to final self-control performance. The same is true for more specific mood items, such as frustration, irritation, annoyance, boredom, or interest as well. Feedback about <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> of the self-control efforts does not appear to affect performance. In short, the decline in self-control performance after exerting self-control appears to be directly related to the amount of self-control exerted and cannot be easily explained by other, well-established psychological processes.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} {{striking}} regional variations in food security. Although food insecurity {{can be difficult}} to measure, 45% of elementary and secondary students in Maine qualify for free or reduced-price school lunch; by some measures Maine has been declared the most food-insecure of the New England states. Transportation challenges and distance are common barriers to families in rural areas who seek food assistance. Social stigma is another important consideration, and for children, sensitively administering in-school programs can make the difference between <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure.</b> For instance, when John Woods, co-founder of Full Plates, Full Potential, learned that embarrassed students were shying away from the free breakfasts being distributed at a school he was working with, he made arrangements to provide breakfast free of charge to all of the students there.|$|E
25|$|Book 3 {{relates the}} history of Babylon from Nabonassaros to Antiochus I (presumably). Again, {{it is likely that}} he used king-lists, though it is not known which ones he used. The Mesopotamian {{documents}} known as King-List A (one copy from the 6th or 5th centuries BC) and Chronicle 1 (3 copies with one confidently dated to 500 BC) are usually suggested as the ones he used, due to the synchronicity between those and his History (though there are some differences). A large part of his history around the time of Naboukhodonosoros (Nebuchadnezzar II, 604562 BC) and Nabonnedos (Nabonidus, 556539 BC) survives. Here we see his interpretation of history for the first time, moralising about the <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> of kings based on their moral conduct. This is similar to another Babylonian history, Chronicle of Nabonidus (as well as to the Hebrew Bible), and differs from the rationalistic accounts of other Greek historians like Thucydides.|$|E

500|$|No. 36001 was {{immediately}} put into service trials using empty passenger carriage {{stock in the}} south-east of England. The official trial records kept at Brighton works reported varying degrees of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> on the runs undertaken. However, {{the results of the}} trials as reported to British Railways headquarters at Marylebone were [...] "conspicuous by the absence of praise" [...] for the strengths of the Leader, namely the boiler, braking system and total adhesion provided by the two bogies. Several theories have been put forward regarding this state of affairs, the most plausible being that the more conservative members of the railway workforce at Brighton and the Railway Executive felt that the Leader was too revolutionary and were keen to maintain the status quo.|$|E
500|$|Kosar, {{who wanted}} to play for Cleveland because his family lived {{in a suburb of}} nearby Youngstown, Ohio, signed a five-year {{contract}} worth nearly $6 million in 1985 and was immediately embraced by the Browns organization and the team's fans. [...] "It's not an everyday occurrence that somebody wants to play in Cleveland", Modell said. [...] "This has lent such an aura to Bernie." [...] Kosar saw his first action in the fifth week of the 1985 season against the New England Patriots, when he substituted before halftime for Gary Danielson, a 34-year-old veteran who the Browns had acquired in the offseason from the Lions. Kosar fumbled his first-ever NFL snap, but rebounded and led the team to a 24–20 win. A mix of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> followed, but Kosar progressed a bit more each Sunday and led the team to an 8–8 record. Two young running backs, Earnest Byner and Kevin Mack, complemented Kosar's aerial attack with more than 1,000yards rushing each.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the first}} seven episodes of the season {{revolved}} around the characters organizing a harvest festival, which had previously been a Pawnee tradition before it ended. The storyline stemmed from serious budget problems facing Pawnee and the major cuts threatened to the parks department, which prompts Leslie to bring the harvest festival back and stake {{the future of the}} entire department on its <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure.</b> The festival served as a device to bring all the characters together working toward a common goal, similar to efforts to turn a construction pit into a park during the first two seasons. Schur said the harvest festival story arc was written in part because the first six episodes were written and filmed early, so the writing staff felt having one concise storyline to tie them together kept the show focused. Schur also said the writers were fatigued from working on six third-season episodes immediately after the second season, so the harvest festival story arc helped [...] "organize our tired, end-of-the-year brains".|$|E
500|$|Mukerji {{has been}} {{described}} by the critics {{as one of the most}} accomplished actresses of Bollywood. As part of a career analysis, Sukanya Verma noted that Mukerji made a [...] "rather unconventional debut in films" [...] (she played a rape victim in Raja Ki Aayegi Baarat), and after a few years of oscillating between <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure,</b> she [...] "achieved the status of a star, performer and showgirl". Indo-Asian News Service reported that during her initial years in the industry, Mukerji was referred to as the successful Kajol's poor cousin and was written off by the critics for being [...] "plump" [...] and [...] "short". Raja Sen added that despite the odds being against her, Mukerji [...] "slogged her way with grit" [...] and emerged as [...] "the most powerful leading lady in Bollywood". Film critic Baradwaj Rangan of the New Sunday Express writes that Mukerji's unusual [...] "sandpaper-scratchy, I'm-recovering-from-a-bad-cold" [...] voice sets her apart from her contemporaries and The Times of India has credited her for breaking the [...] "fairness myth" [...] of Bollywood.|$|E
500|$|Sullivan's only grand opera, Ivanhoe, {{based on}} Walter Scott's novel, opened at Carte's new Royal English Opera House on 31 January 1891. Sullivan {{completed}} the score {{too late to}} meet Carte's planned production date, and costs mounted; Sullivan was required to pay Carte a contractual penalty of £3,000 for his delay. The production lasted for 155 consecutive performances, an unprecedented run for a serious opera, and earned good notices for its music. Afterwards, Carte was unable to fill the new opera house with other opera productions, however, and Ivanhoe was blamed {{for the failure of}} the opera house. The opera passed into obscurity after a touring revival in 1894–95. The episode was, as the critic Herman Klein observed, [...] "the strangest comingling of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> ever chronicled in the history of British lyric enterprise!" [...] Sullivan did not seriously consider writing grand opera again. Later in 1891, Sullivan composed music for Tennyson's The Foresters, which ran well at Daly's Theatre in New York in 1892, but failed in London the following year.|$|E

500|$|Although Primus was {{a regular}} member of Perrin's team {{at the end of}} the 2004–05 season and captained the side on {{occasions}} during pre-season, he rarely featured until Perrin's sacking in November. The return of Harry Redknapp, who had been won over by his performances and was now one of his biggest admirers, to Portsmouth lead to Primus' immediate return to the side, and he was ever present in the side that achieved Premiership survival in the last 10 games of the season. Primus remained a regular in the Portsmouth defence for the 2006–07 season, partnering England international Sol Campbell in the centre of defence, and Redknapp hailed him as the unofficial Player of the Season; the official winner of the award was David James. He failed to make an appearance in 2007–08 due to a career threatening knee injury. He was treated with surgery performed by Dr. Richard Steadman who is known to have saved the careers of many footballers, including Alan Shearer and Ronaldo. After the operation, Primus commented [...] "The difference between <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> is what you do afterwards in your rehabilitation, not necessarily the actual operation." [...] Despite his injury, he still managed to earn a new one-year deal at Portsmouth in May 2008.|$|E
