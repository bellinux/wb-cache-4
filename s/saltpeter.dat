5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to a manufacturer of <b>saltpeter</b> (an essential component of gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, <b>saltpeter</b> was in great demand in France. <b>Saltpeter</b> produced from French nitre beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. He noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.|$|E
5|$|In the fire's {{first two}} hours, it reached a large {{multi-story}} warehouse occupied by Crocker & Warren on Broad Street, where a large quantity of combustible <b>saltpeter</b> was stored.|$|E
5|$|The Arabs {{acquired}} {{knowledge of}} gunpowder {{some time after}} 1240, but before 1280, by which time had written, in Arabic, recipes for gunpowder, instructions for the purification of <b>saltpeter,</b> and descriptions of gunpowder incendiaries.|$|E
5|$|Bat dung, {{a type of}} guano, is rich in nitrates and is mined from caves for use as fertilizer. During the U.S. Civil War, <b>saltpeter</b> was {{collected}} from caves to make gunpowder; {{it was thought that}} this was bat guano, but most of the nitrate comes from nitrifying bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Bengal was an {{affluent}} region with a Bengali Muslim majority and Bengali Hindu minority, and was globally dominant in {{industries such as}} textile manufacturing and shipbuilding. The capital Dhaka had an estimated 80,000 skilled textile weavers. It was an exporter of silk and cotton textiles, steel, <b>saltpeter,</b> and agricultural and industrial produce.|$|E
5|$|Long {{took the}} lead in {{preparing}} the explosives, telling his followers that his experience as a fortuneteller, mystic and natural healer made him an expert. The bombs were made from cannon shot, carbon, sulphur and <b>saltpeter,</b> which were then wrapped together.|$|E
5|$|According to the Scottish {{physician}} Francis Buchanan {{who visited}} Mangalore in 1801, Mangalore {{was a rich}} and prosperous port with flourishing trading activity. Rice was the grand article of export, and was exported to Muscat, Bombay, Goa and Malabar. Supari or Betel-nut was exported to Bombay, Surat and Kutch. Pepper and Sandalwood were exported to Bombay. Turmeric was exported to Muscat, Kutch, Surat and Bombay, along with Cassia Cinnamon, Sugar, Iron, <b>Saltpeter,</b> Ginger, Coir and Timber.|$|E
5|$|The Great New York City Fire of 1845 {{broke out}} on July 19, 1845. The fire started in a whale oil and candle {{manufacturing}} establishment and quickly {{spread to other}} wooden structures in New York City the neighborhood. It reached a warehouse on Broad Street where combustible <b>saltpeter</b> was stored and caused a massive explosion that spread the fire even farther.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was debated in the days immediately following the fire. Public speculation led {{to the arrest of}} Crocker and Warren, the occupants of the warehouse. The Daily-Tribune reported that the explosions could not have occurred without the presence of gunpowder in addition to the <b>saltpeter,</b> and thus they were suspected of possessing gunpowder, which would have led to a murder charge. However, later inquiry released Crocker and Warren of all charges as no evidence of gunpowder was discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} of the Jin {{were armed}} with fire lances. The fire lance was a spear, with {{a tube of}} gunpowder attached to it. The mixture contained, besides the gunpowder ingredients of sulfur, charcoal, and <b>saltpeter,</b> ground porcelain and iron filings. The flame that shot from the lance reached a distance of three meters. The heated tinder that ignited the weapon was stored in a small iron box toted by the Jurchen soldiers in battle. Once the gunpowder was consumed, the fire lance could be wielded like a normal spear, or replenished by a new tube filled with gunpowder.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of San Martín repeated {{some of the}} ideas outlined in the Operations plan, drafted by Mariano Moreno {{at the beginning of the}} war. A combination of incentives, confiscations and planned economy allowed the country to provision the army: gunpowder, pieces of artillery, mules and horses, food, military clothing, etc. Mining increased, with increased extraction of lead, copper, <b>saltpeter,</b> sulfur and borax, which had several usages and improved local finances. Hundreds of women wove clothing used by the soldiers. Father José Luis Beltrán headed a military factory of 700 men, which produced rifles and horseshoes. San Martín stayed on good terms with both the {{government of}} Buenos Aires and the provincial caudillos, without fully allying with either one. He was able to receive provisions from both. He considered that the war of independence took priority over the civil wars.|$|E
25|$|<b>Saltpeter</b> {{was known}} to the Chinese by the mid-1st century AD and was {{primarily}} produced in the provinces of Sichuan, Shanxi, and Shandong. There is strong evidence {{of the use of}} <b>saltpeter</b> and sulfur in various medicinal combinations. A Chinese alchemical text dated 492 noted <b>saltpeter</b> burnt with a purple flame, providing a practical and reliable means of distinguishing it from other inorganic salts, thus enabling alchemists to evaluate and compare purification techniques; the earliest Latin accounts of <b>saltpeter</b> purification are dated after 1200.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} ghost towns {{throughout}} Latin America were once mining camps or lumber mills, {{such as the}} many <b>saltpeter</b> mining camps that prospered in Chile {{from the end of}} the <b>Saltpeter</b> War until the invention of synthetic <b>saltpeter</b> during World War I. Some of these towns, such as the Humberstone and Santa Laura <b>Saltpeter</b> Works in the Atacama Desert, have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Another former mining town, Real de Catorce in Mexico, has been used as a backdrop for Hollywood movies such as The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), The Mexican (2001), and Bandidas (2006).|$|E
25|$|By the 16th century, Indians were {{manufacturing}} {{a diverse}} variety of firearms; large guns in particular, became visible in Tanjore, Dacca, Bijapur and Murshidabad. Guns made of bronze were recovered from Calicut (1504) and Diu (1533). Gujarāt supplied Europe <b>saltpeter</b> {{for use in}} gunpowder warfare during the 17th century. Bengal and Mālwa participated in <b>saltpeter</b> production. The Dutch, French, Portuguese, and English used Chhapra as a center of <b>saltpeter</b> refining.|$|E
25|$|In {{partnership}} with Valentine Simon, various other individuals would own the land through the War of 1812, when Mammoth Cave's <b>saltpeter</b> reserves became significant {{due to the}} British blockade of United States's ports. The blockade starved the American military of <b>saltpeter</b> and therefore gunpowder. As a result, the domestic price of <b>saltpeter</b> rose and production based on nitrates extracted from caves such as Mammoth Cave became more lucrative.|$|E
25|$|In India, guns made {{of bronze}} were {{recovered}} from Calicut (1504) and Diu (1533). By the 17th century, Indians were manufacturing a diverse variety of firearms; large guns in particular, became visible in Tanjore, Dacca, Bijapur and Murshidabad. Gujarāt supplied Europe <b>saltpeter</b> {{for use in}} gunpowder warfare during the 17th century. Bengal and Mālwa participated in <b>saltpeter</b> production.

25|$|The Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan {{is known}} to have {{introduced}} much more advanced matchlocks, their designs were a combination of Ottoman and Mughal designs. Shah Jahan also countered the British and other Europeans in his province of Gujarāt, which supplied Europe <b>saltpeter</b> for use in gunpowder warfare during the 17th century. Bengal and Mālwa participated in <b>saltpeter</b> production. The Dutch, French, Portuguese, and English used Chhapra as a center of <b>saltpeter</b> refining.|$|E
25|$|Wanu (Hispanicized guano) is a Quechua {{word for}} fertilizer. Potassium nitrate (ordinary <b>saltpeter)</b> and sodium nitrate (Chile <b>saltpeter)</b> are {{nitrogen-containing}} compounds collectively {{referred to as}} salpeter, saltpetre, salitre, caliche, or nitrate. They are used as fertilizer with also other important uses.|$|E
25|$|French war {{powder in}} 1879 used the ratio 75% <b>saltpeter,</b> 12.5% {{charcoal}}, 12.5% sulfur. English war powder in 1879 used the ratio 75% <b>saltpeter,</b> 15% charcoal, 10% sulfur. The British Congreve rockets used 62.4% <b>saltpeter,</b> 23.2% charcoal and 14.4% sulfur, but the British Mark VII gunpowder {{was changed to}} 65% <b>saltpeter,</b> 20% charcoal and 15% sulfur. The explanation for the wide variety in formulation relates to usage. Powder used for rocketry can use a slower burn rate since it accelerates the projectile for a much longer time—whereas powders for weapons such as flintlocks, cap-locks, or matchlocks need a higher burn rate to accelerate the projectile in a much shorter distance. Cannons usually used lower burn rate powders, because most would burst with higher burn rate powders.|$|E
25|$|Hasan al-Rammah also {{describes}} the purifying of <b>saltpeter</b> using the chemical processes of solution and crystallization. This {{was the first}} clear method for the purification of <b>saltpeter.</b> The earliest torpedo was also first described in 1270 by Hasan al-Rammah in The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War Devices, which illustrated a torpedo running with a rocket system filled with explosive materials and having three firing points.|$|E
25|$|At {{least as}} far back as 1845, Chilean <b>saltpeter</b> {{deposits}} were exploited in Chile and California, USA.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the United States Civil War, the claimants were {{subjects}} of the Queen of Great Britain, but had been residents within the United States prior and during the war. In December, 1861, the claimants began to manufacture <b>saltpeter,</b> an ingredient of gunpowder, in Santa Cave, a cave 7 miles (11.25km) southwest of Scottsboro, Alabama. During the war, the <b>saltpeter</b> was sold to the Confederate States of America military.|$|E
25|$|After the {{adoption}} of gunpowder, municipal outhouses became {{an important source of}} raw material for the making of <b>saltpeter</b> in European countries.|$|E
25|$|During the American Civil War, British India was {{the main}} source for <b>saltpeter</b> for the {{manufacture}} of gunpowder for the Union armies. This supply was threatened by the British government during the Trent Affair, when Union naval forces stopped a British ship, the RMS Trent, and removed two Confederate diplomats. The British government responded in part by halting all exports of <b>saltpeter</b> to the United States, threatening their gunpowder manufacturing resources. Shortly thereafter, the situation was resolved and the Confederate diplomats were released.|$|E
25|$|Gunpowder, {{also known}} as black powder to {{distinguish}} it from modern smokeless gunpowder, is the earliest known chemical explosive. It consists of a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate (<b>saltpeter).</b> The sulfur and charcoal act as fuels while the <b>saltpeter</b> is an oxidizer. Because of its incendiary properties {{and the amount of}} heat and gas volume that it generates, gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms, rockets, fireworks, and as a blasting powder in quarrying, mining, and road building.|$|E

25|$|The land {{containing}} {{this historic}} entrance was first surveyed and registered in 1798 {{under the name}} of Valentine Simons. Simons began exploiting Mammoth Cave for its <b>saltpeter</b> reserves.|$|E
25|$|It {{occurs as}} a mineral niter {{and is a}} natural solid source of nitrogen. Potassium nitrate {{is one of several}} {{nitrogen-containing}} compounds collectively referred to as <b>saltpeter</b> or saltpetre.|$|E
25|$|Deposits {{of sodium}} nitrate (NaNO3) (Chilean <b>saltpeter)</b> {{are also found}} in the Atacama desert in Chile {{and was one of the}} {{original}} (1830) nitrogen-rich fertilizers used. It is still mined for fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|Black powder {{made with}} less-expensive and more {{plentiful}} sodium nitrate (in appropriate proportions) works just as well, and previous equations apply, with sodium instead of potassium. However, {{it is more}} hygroscopic than powders made from potassium nitrate—popularly known as <b>saltpeter.</b> Because corned black powder grains made with <b>saltpeter</b> are less affected by moisture in the air, they can be stored unsealed without degradation by humidity. Muzzleloaders {{have been known to}} fire after hanging on a wall for decades in a loaded state, provided they remained dry. By contrast, black powder made with sodium nitrate must be kept sealed to remain stable.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{nitric acid}} was {{produced}} by combining sulfuric acid with nitrates such as <b>saltpeter.</b> In modern times this is reversed: nitrates are produced from nitric acid produced via the Ostwald process.|$|E
25|$|Scheele's {{study of}} the gas not yet named oxygen was {{prompted}} by a complaint by Torbern Olof Bergman, a professor at Upsala University who would eventually become Scheele's friend. Bergman informed Scheele that the <b>saltpeter</b> he had purchased from Scheele's employer, after long heating, produced red vapors (now known to be nitrogen dioxide) when it {{came into contact with}} acetic acid. Scheele's quick explanation was that the <b>saltpeter</b> had absorbed phlogiston with the heat (had been reduced to nitrite, in modern terms) and gave off a new phlogisticated gas as an active principle when combined with an acid (even a weak acid).|$|E
25|$|During the American Revolutionary War, {{a number}} of caves were mined for <b>saltpeter</b> to make {{gunpowder}} when supplies from Europe were embargoed. Abigail Adams, reputedly also made gunpowder at her family farm in Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|During this time, European {{manufacturers}} {{also began}} regularly purifying <b>saltpeter,</b> using wood ashes containing potassium carbonate to precipitate calcium from their dung liquor, and using ox blood, alum, and slices of turnip {{to clarify the}} solution.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the logical}} follow through is sound, the corning {{hypothesis}} has been refuted for two reasons. One, the powder makers were probably {{more worried about}} spoilage than the effect of corned gunpowder on guns, and two, corning as a practice had existed in China since the 1370s. In Europe corning arose {{as a response to}} the difficulty of obtaining pure <b>saltpeter,</b> specifically <b>saltpeter</b> consisting of potassium nitrate, rather than sodium nitrate or calcium nitrate, the latter two of which absorb water vapor more readily than potassium nitrate. Thus corning was an imperative to producing reliable weaponized gunpowder. Supposedly this was much less problematic in Asia, where pure <b>saltpeter</b> was more readily available and easily manufactured. In China gunpowder corning had been practiced since the 1370s for the purpose of strengthening the explosive power of mines, since gunpowder corns provided more space required for a rapid combustion. Corned powder might also have been used in guns based on a record of a fire-tube shooting a projectile 457 meters, a feet probably only possible with the aid of corned powder at the time.|$|E
25|$|Although the Haber {{process is}} mainly {{used to produce}} {{fertilizer}} today, during World War I it provided Germany with a source of ammonia {{for the production of}} explosives, compensating for the Allied trade blockade on Chilean <b>saltpeter.</b>|$|E
