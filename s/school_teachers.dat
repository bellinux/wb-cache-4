40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to make clear the {{structure}} of teacher behaviors in physical education class in junior high schools and to examine the effect of the subject matter on those behaviors. The subjects were 29 physical education classes instructed by 29 teachers in junior high <b>schools.</b> The <b>teacher</b> behaviors in those classes were observed by the systematic observation instrumentation. Main findings were as follows. 1) Major teacher behaviors in physical education class in junior high schools were management, instruction, monitoring, interaction. Though Siedentop, D reported 3 behaviors excluding interaction as the major behaviors, we could recognize that interaction behavior took the same rate as other behaviors. 2) There were significant differences between junior high <b>school</b> <b>teacher's</b> behavior and elementaly <b>school</b> <b>teacher's</b> behavior. Especially, the amount of time spent for management and corrective feedback of junior high <b>school</b> <b>teacher's</b> behavior were more than elementaly <b>school</b> <b>teacher's</b> behavior. But the amount of time spent for question, acceptance and positive feedback of junior high <b>school</b> <b>teacher's</b> behavior were lower than elementary <b>school</b> <b>teacher's</b> behavior. 3) The result of teacher's behavior was affected by subject matters. The more amount of time was spent for management on Track and field and Gymnastics than on Ball game. The more amount of time was spent for direct instruction on Gymnastics than on Track and field and Ball game...|$|R

5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard English spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.|$|E

To help elementary <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> further their studies, Soeman took part in establishing a private junior high school in 1953.

Minister of Education Mohammad Yamin attended the opening ceremony, where Soeman compared the situation in Riau to that of Aceh and North Sumatra and declared that the people of Riau had been treated like stepchildren. He called for Yamin to send government teachers to support Setia Dharma. Though Yamin objected to Soeman's rhetoric and did not send any teachers to Setia Dharma, he did arrange for a state senior high school to be opened in Riau.|$|E
