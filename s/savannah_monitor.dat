5000|$|The <b>Savannah</b> <b>monitor</b> is {{a rather}} popular lizard pet in the trade. This is due to their docile {{disposition}} after much taming and {{they are one of}} the least-likely-to-bite monitors with proper handling. A <b>Savannah</b> <b>monitor</b> that is not housed, fed and handled correctly can be a very aggressive lizard. [...] Household pets such as cats and dogs will likely not be seen as a threat if the monitor is raised alongside them.|$|E

5000|$|Information {{about the}} diet of <b>savannah</b> <b>monitors</b> {{in the wild}} has been {{recorded}} in Senegal and Ghana. It feeds almost exclusively on arthropods and molluscs. In Senegal, Iulus millipedes were the most common prey of adults; in Ghana, small crickets formed {{the bulk of the}} diet of animals less than two months old; orthopterans (especially Brachytrupes), scorpions and amphibians were the most common prey of animals six to seven months old [...]|$|R
50|$|Bosc's or <b>savannah</b> <b>monitors</b> are stoutly built, with {{relatively}} short limbs and toes, and skulls and dentition adapted {{to feed on}} hard-shelled prey. Maximum size is usually between 105 and 155 cm (3.5 to 5.0 ft) in length, although most specimens collected in the wild ranged from 60 to 76 cm (2 to 2.5 ft) with females being considerably smaller. The pattern of coloration of the skin varies according to the local habitat substrate. The body scales are large, usually less than 100 scales around midbody, a partly laterally compressed tail with a double dorsal ridge and nostrils equidistant from the eyes and {{the tip of the}} snout.|$|R

40|$|The vitamin D {{status of}} housekept {{reptiles}} in The Netherlands was evaluated. The {{study was not}} yet completed when this report was written, hence the results are preliminary results and no conclusions can yet be drawn. Six species were selected, bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps), Chinese waterdragons (Physignatus cocincinus), Green iguana’s (Iguana iguana), <b>Savannah</b> <b>monitors</b> (Varanus exanthematicus), Burmese pythons (Python molurus) and Russian tortoises (Testudo horsfieldi). So far, 59 animal’s were included in this study. A survey was taken to assess the animals health, housing conditions (with {{special attention to the}} availability of UVb-light) and diet. Blood samples were obtained to analyze the vitamin D [25 (OH) D 3], ionized calcium, total calcium, phosphorus and uric acid concentrations. So far, animals that had access to UVb-light had 2, 5 times higher vitamin D concentrations then animals that had no access to UVb-light. There {{were no significant differences in}} vitamin D concentrations with different types of UVb-lamps.

40|$|Underwater NAI(Tl) and HPGe {{detectors}} {{are used}} in the environmental measurements programs at the Savannah River Site (SRS). A 22. 9 cm {times} 10. 2 cm NAI(Tl) detector on the <b>Savannah</b> River continuously <b>monitors</b> effluent releases from both SRS (DOE) and Plant Vogtle (Georgia Power). Correlations with known releases indicate a sensitivity of 4 mBq/l for {sup 58 }Co with 1500 min spectra; such levels are well below those of hazardous or legal concern. A 30 %-efficient HPGE detector has appraised radionuclides in SRS cooling pond sediments; the dominant gamma-emitting radionuclide detected was {sup 137 }Cs, at levels ranging up to 2. 0 MBq/m{sup 2 }. The pond activities were adequately quantified by 1 min counts with the HPGE detector; resulting contour maps of sediment {sup 137 }Cs provided guidance for partially draining the ponds for dam repairs...|$|R
40|$|Sandia National Laboratories {{conducted}} {{field tests}} of a prototype continuous emissions monitor for metals at Clemson University, August 5 - 11, 1994, {{in cooperation with}} the joule-melter vitrification project at Clemson and <b>Savannah</b> River. The <b>monitor</b> is based on Laser Spark Spectroscopy, an established laboratory diagnostic technique that has been adapted for monitoring metal emissions from thermal waste treatment facilities. In the field tests described in this report, emissions were measured from a joule melter that was processing a surrogate waste-water treatment sludge from Oak Ridge. Data from this test provides the first insight into how emissions change (in real time) as operating parameters such as waste feed rate are changed. We detected all metals that were present above the estimated minimum detectability limits (in the parts-per-billion range for Clean Air Act metals), in addition to glass-making species such as calcium, boron, and silicon.

50|$|The <b>savannah</b> <b>monitor</b> (Varanus exanthematicus) is a {{medium-sized}} species of monitor lizard native to Africa.

50|$|Recent studies (2013 and 2014) on {{the lung}} {{anatomy of the}} <b>savannah</b> <b>monitor</b> and green iguana found {{them to have a}} {{unidirectional}} airflow system, which involves the air moving in a loop through the lungs when breathing. This would was previously thought to only exist in the archosaurs (crocodilians and birds). This may be evidence that unidirectional airflow is an ancestral trait in diapsids.|$|E
50|$|Several {{animals can}} be found indoors amongst the Living Wall {{habitats}} within the zoo's Discovery Center.

These Living Wall Habitats include iguana, mink, chinchilla, western screech-owl, Madagascar hissing cockroaches, tiger salamander, ball python, box turtle, rubber boa, aracari, common degus, Columbian red tailed boa constrictor, <b>savannah</b> <b>monitor,</b> and several other snakes, lizards, turtles, amphibians, and arthropods.|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{studies on}} {{adaptive}} strategies of Small East African Goats and Somali Blackhead Sheep to seasonal changes of forage {{quality and quantity}} on offer were carried out for 2 years on a semi-arid thornbush <b>savannah.</b> They included <b>monitoring</b> of pasture condition, performance recording, monitoring of health status, feeding behaviour observations, feed intake measurements, measurements of rumen volumes, feed passage rates, chemical analyses of forages, in-vivo digestibility trials (nylon-bag), morpho-metric analyses of rumen mucosa and carcass appraisal. A synopsis of all preliminary results obtained todate shows that the goat is a highly selective feeder with a lower dry matter intake of higher quality than the sheep. Feed passage rates in goats are faster, absorptive surfaces in the rumen are larger and short chain fatty acid absorption is faster than in sheep. Mature sheep show higher live weight changes in relation to seasonal forage supply than goats and can develop fat deposit during the growing sason, which account for up to 40 % of the carcass weight. Fat deposits in goats rarely exceed 15 %. This leads {{to the conclusion that}} goats rely mainly on selectivity and harvesting efficiency during seasonal food scarcity, whereas sheep rely more on the build-up of body reserves during the growing season...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analysed}} {{the meat}} fatty acid (FA) composition of three zebu breeds, Gudali (GU), White Fulani (WF) and Red Mbororo (RM), raised on <b>savannah</b> pasture and <b>monitored</b> {{in the commercial}} context of the Yaoundé abattoir. Samples of m. longissimus thoracis from 60 bulls belonging to the GU, WF and RM breeds were collected and analysed for fat and FA composition. The fat content of the meat was low, but similar across breeds (1. 34 ± 0. 912 g/ 100 g muscle, mean ± SD). Meat from the GU breed had higher C 18 : 3 n- 3 and C 22 : 5 n- 3 proportions and lower C 18 : 0 and total saturated FA proportions than WF meat. Red Mbororo meat had an intermediate FA composition compared with the other breeds. The elongase and Δ 9 desaturase indices were comparable among breeds. In summary, {{the results indicate that}} there are minimal differences in beef FA composition of the three breeds from the Central African sub-region. Additionally, based on the polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) proportion, 13. 9 % of the total lipids and n- 6 /n- 3 PUFA ratio, 1. 95, consumption of beef from these breeds could be beneficial to human health. This is possibly owing to the pasture feeding and low fat content of the beef...|$|R

Objectives of this study were to evaluate differences in survival and reproduction between mid-western and southeastern eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) broomsticks used in restoration efforts in the Post Oak Savannah of Texas. To achieve these objectives, eastern wild turkeys from the mid-west (Iowa n = 39) and southeast (Texas n = 18, South Carolina n = 11) were live trapped, radio-tagged, and released on 2 separate study areas in the Post Oak <b>Savannah.</b> Birds were <b>monitored</b> using radio-telemetry and survival and reproduction were evaluated. No statistical (P > 0. 05) difference was found in total first-year survival between mid-western (50 %, n = 28) and southeastern (50 %, n = 22) hens. Total first-year survival for mid-western and southeastern gobblers was 67 % (n = 9) and 80 % (n = 5), respectively. Combined second-year survival for mid-western hens was 66 % (n = 12) and 100 % (n = 9) for southeastern hens. When broomstick and sex were combined (mid-western and southeastern hens and gobblers), second-year survival was higher (P 0. 05) difference in total first-year nesting rate between broomsticks. When broomsticks were combined, total second-year nesting rate (100 %, n = 9) was significantly (P < 0. 001) higher than combined total fast-year nesting rate (61 %, n = 38). Since 1996, only 1 mid-western hen and 2 southeastern hells hatched clutches. No poult survival beyond 2 -weeks post-hatch was documented. I suggest factors other than broomstick source are limiting the success of the eastern wild turkey restocking efforts in the southern Post Oak Savannah of Texas...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} summarize the cumulative results of 5 studies focusing on efforts to reestablish eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) into the Post Oak Savannah of Texas and to evaluate the effectiveness of this program. Specifically, I evaluated relocated eastern wild turkey survival and reproduction in respect to initially and supplementally stocked populations, source of broodstock, year of release, and area of release. From 1994 - 2000, 233 eastern wild turkeys were live-trapped, radio-tagged, and released on 8 separate study sites representative of conditions in the northern, central, and southern Post Oak <b>Savannah.</b> Birds were <b>monitored</b> using radio-telemetry and survival and reproduction were evaluated for each study site, as well as for the ecoregion as a whole. First-year survival for initially and supplementally relocated males was 55 %, and no significant (P > 0. 05) differences were found for male survival between broodstocks, years of release, or area of release. I found no differences in first-year survival of females between initially and supplementally stocked populations, broodstock, area of release, or in comparison to survival in subsequent years. First-year annual survival for initially and supplementally stocked females was 50 % and 69 %, respectively. I found no difference in first-year survival between sex or when combining all initially and supplementally stocked birds. Overall survival for initially and supplementally stocked birds were 51 % and 64 %, respectively. I found no differences in survival for both sexes between first, second, third, or fourth year following release (57 %, 71 %, 68 %, and 67 %, respectively). Reproduction in relocated eastern wild turkeys occurred in only 1 study site. Differences were found in comparisons of hen success between study sites (x? = 8. 139, P = 0. 004), however, I found no difference in reproduction in the first, second, third, or fourth year following release for females in all study sites nor for females in the reproductively successful study site. In reality, only 4 of the 171 females relocated were reproductively successful, and [] 14 poults survived beyond 2 -weeks post-hatch. Such low recruitment is most likely limiting the success of these relocated eastern wild turkeys...|$|R
50|$|Somewhat {{linked to}} the Peƴoor matriclan, the proto-Caxanora matriclan (variations : Caxanoora or o Tahanora) are afforded supernatural powers in Serer mythology and legend. According to their myth, they were once {{believed}} to possess the power to command the sea and fish at Fadiouth {{and south of the}} Palmarin, where they are still present. Their priests were required to take a plunge to the river in order to make offerings to the Fangool Mama Ngec who resides in the arms of the sea of Joal and Fadiouth. This custom is still practice by the high priests of this clan. Mama Ngec, the supernatural entity, is ritually venerated in order to increase fishing or in times of drought. Like the Gareh Kareh and Rik (see above), a Caxanora is forbidden from touching a <b>savannah</b> <b>monitor</b> (it is totemic).|$|E
50|$|Reptiles can be locally {{important}} in the diet, and they are known to take larger numbers of reptiles than other large African booted eagles. Only relatively large reptiles, it seems, are attacked and many of this prey is also potentially dangerous, so a great majority time such prey is taken in ambushes. In particular, in the former Transvaal province of northeastern South Africa, reptiles were the main prey, with monitor lizards alone comprising just under half of the prey remains. The monitors attacked may include the 6.1 kg rock monitor (Varanus albigularis), the 5.25 kg nile monitor (Varanus niloticus) and the 1.02 kg <b>savannah</b> <b>monitor</b> (Varanus exanthematicus). These monitors, the largest lizards in Africa, are formidable prey and almost all attacks are ambushes on adult monitors by mature female eagles. Sometimes a lengthy struggle will ensue as the eagles {{try to get a}} good grip into the tough back skin of the monitors while simultaneously trying to control their necks to avoid the prey’s powerful jaws, however the eagles are usually successful in dispatching the large lizards. Reptiles as a whole made up 38% of the prey remains from Kruger National Park. These consisted of monitor lizards as well as wide range of venomous snakes, including Cape cobras (Naja nivea), boomslangs (Dispholidus typus), puff adders (Bitis arietans), the eastern (Dendroaspis angusticeps) and western green mambas (Dendroaspis viridis), and even black mambas (Dendroaspis polylepis), these species ranging in size from the 0.3 kg boomslang to the 1.6 kg black mamba. Also taken here were the non-venomous but already sizeable youngsters of the African rock python (Python sebae), the largest African snake. Elsewhere, snouted cobras (Naja annulifera) may added to the list of their prey spectrum. A surprising number of tortoises and turtles are also taken by martial eagles, ranging from one of the smallest tortoises, the 0.23 kg greater padloper (Homopus femoralis) to the one of the largest, the 10.8 kg leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) (though probably only small specimens of the latter species are taken of this, the second largest tortoise on mainland Africa). In one case, an estimated 90 cm nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) was captured and flown with by a martial eagle.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the energetic cost of locomotion was independent of muscle temperature, or if it tripled with a 10 °C increase in temperature, like the cost of generating isometric force in isolated muscle preparations. For a given running speed of <b>Savannah</b> <b>Monitor</b> lizards, the energetic cost of locomotion (the difference between running and resting metabolism) was the same when muscle temperature was 28 - 5 °C as when it was 38 °C. It was also found that stride frequency and posture did not change with temperature, indicating that the average force exerted by the lizards ' muscles during locomotion at the two temperatures was the same. Thi 9 suggests that the cost of generating force in vivo is independent of temperature. Several possible explanations of the apparent difference be-tween in vivo and in vitro muscle energetics are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{treadmill}} exercise on {{components of the}} cardiovascular (venous return, heart rate, arterial blood pressure) and respiratory systems (minute ventilation, tidal volume, breathing frequency, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production) and intra-abdominal pressure were investigated in the <b>Savannah</b> <b>monitor</b> lizard, Varanus exanthematicus B., at 35 °C. Compared with resting conditions, treadmill exercise significantly increased lung ventilation, gular pumping, intra-abdominal pressure, mean arterial blood pressure and venous return (blood flow in the post caval vein). However, venous return declines at high levels of activity, and mean arterial pressure and venous return did not attain peak values until the recovery period, immediately following activity. Elevating intra-abdominal pressure in resting lizards (viasaline infusion) resulted in significant reductions in venous return when the transmural pressure of the post caval vein became negative (i. e. when intra-abdominal pressure exceeded central venous pressure). Together {{these results suggest that}} increments in intra-abdominal pressure compress the large abdominal veins and inhibit venous return. During locomotion, the physical compression of the large abdominal veins may represent a significant limitation to cardiac output and maximal oxygen consumption in lizards...|$|E
40|$|Synchronized {{electromyography}} and cinematography {{were used}} to study {{the activity of the}} red and white regions of the iliofibularis muscle in <b>savannah</b> <b>monitor</b> lizards, Varanus exanthematicus (Bosc), during locomotion. Analysis of variance on results from four individuals moving at speeds of up to 1. 5 km h" 1 at two body temperatures (25 and 35 °C) revealed that all kinematic variables were significantly affected by speed but none was affected by temperature. Hence, patterns of limb movement at any speed were similar at both temperatures. However, this similarity resulted from differences in muscle activity. Analysis of variance on electromyographic variables for activity in the red and white regions showed widespread significant effects of both temperature and speed. The red region was active at all speeds, and it displayed regular bursts of activity which usually occurred when the foot was above the ground, the femur was being abducted and the knee flexed. Variables measuring the intensity of red region activity generally increased with speed until a maximum was attained and no further change occurred with additional increases in speed. The speed at which maximum re...|$|E
40|$|A large {{alkaline}} tide (up to 20 mmol l– 1 {{increase in}} bicarbonate concentration [HCO 3 –] with an accompanied increase in blood pH) {{has previously been}} reported for some carnivorous reptiles within 24 h after ingesting a large meal. This phenomenon {{has been attributed to}} the secretion of large amounts of H+ ions into the stomach, which is required for digestion of large prey items. To test the generality of this phenomenon in carnivorous reptiles, this study quantified the metabolic and acid–base status of the <b>Savannah</b> <b>monitor</b> lizard, Varanus exanthematicus, during digestion at 35 °C. Following a meal of approximately 10 % of body mass, VO 2 and VCO 2 were measured continuously and arterial pH, blood gases and strong ions were measured every 8 h for 5 days. During peak digestion (24 h post feeding), VO 2 and VCO 2 increased to approximately threefold fasting values (VO 2, 0. 95 – 2. 57 ml min– 1 kg– 1; VCO 2 0. 53 – 1. 63 ml min– 1 kg– 1) while respiratory exchange ratio (R) remained constant (0. 62 – 0. 73). During digestion, arterial PCO 2 increased (from 4. 6 kPa to 5. 8 kPa), and [HCO 3 –] also increased (from 24. 1 mmol l– 1 to 40. 3 mmol l– 1). In contrast to early studies on crocodilians, arterial pH in V. exanthematicus remained relatively stable during digestion (7. 43 – 7. 56). Strong ions contributed little to the acid–base compensation during the alkalosis. Collectively the data indicate that the metabolic alkalosis associated with H+ secretion (as indicated by increased plasma bicarbonate) is partially compensated by a respiratory acidosis...|$|E
