50|$|In the {{semiconductor}} industry sputtering is used to etch the target. <b>Sputter</b> <b>etching</b> is chosen in cases where {{a high degree of}} etching anisotropy is needed and selectivity is not a concern. One major drawback of this technique is wafer damage.|$|E
50|$|Ion milling, or <b>sputter</b> <b>etching,</b> uses lower pressures, {{often as}} low as 10−4 Torr (10 mPa). It bombards the wafer with {{energetic}} ions of noble gases, often Ar+, which knock atoms from the substrate by transferring momentum. Because the etching is performed by ions, which approach the wafer approximately from one direction, this process is highly anisotropic. On the other hand, it tends to display poor selectivity. Reactive-ion etching (RIE) operates under conditions intermediate between sputter and plasma etching (between 10-3 and 10−1 Torr). Deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) modifies the RIE technique to produce deep, narrow features.|$|E

Molecular dynamics simulations provide insight {{in some of these}} processes, subject to the accessible time and length scales, and the availability of suitable force fields. In this introductory tutorial-style review, we aim to describe the current capabilities and limitations of molecular dynamics simulations in this field, restricting ourselves to low-temperature non-thermal plasmas. Attention is paid to the simulation of the various fundamental processes occurring, including <b>sputtering,</b> <b>etching,</b> implantation and deposition, as well as to what extent the basic plasma components can be accounted for, including, electric, ions, photons.

40|$|For {{many high}} rate PVD {{processes}} an adequate pre-treatment is necessary immediately before the deposition. Because the high deposition rate of some PVD techniques (e. g. electron beam (EB) evaporation) enable {{a very high}} throughput, the pre-treatment {{must be carried out}} with an adequate speed. The <b>sputter</b> <b>etching</b> in a magnetron discharge where the substrate serves as a cathode (target) seems to be a very promising pre-treatment technique for this purpose. This technique is especially suitable for flat, electrically conducting substrates like metal strips and sheets. Because of arc problems in direct current (DC) magnetron discharges due to insulating layers on the cathode surface experiments were carried out using discharges in the medium frequency (MF) range (10 [...] . 100 kHz). During the magnetron <b>sputter</b> <b>etching</b> the light emitted by the etching plasma was investigated by optical emission spectroscopy (OES). After the magnetron <b>sputter</b> <b>etching</b> the substrate surface was investigated by optical glow discharge emission spectroscopy (GDOES). Using a MF pulsed magnetron discharge for <b>sputter</b> <b>etching</b> the damage caused by cathode arcs on the substrate surface could be significantly diminished.

Simultaneous coating and sputtering stimulates high rates of diffusion and forms an interfacial region of graded composition responsible for good adhesion. To obtain such coatings on components far industrial applications, the design and construction Of an ion plater with a 24 " (O. 6 rn) diameter chamber were investigated and modifications of the electron beam gun were proposed. A 12 " (O. 3 m) diameter ion plater was designed and constructed. The equipment was used to develop surfaces for solar energy applications. The conditions to give extended surfaces by <b>sputter</b> <b>etching</b> were studied. Austenitic stainless steel was sputter etched at 20 and 30 mTorr working pressure and at 3, 4 and 5 kV. Uniform etching was achieved by redesigning the specimen holder to give a uniform electrostatic field over the surfaces of the specimens. Surface protrusions were observed after <b>sputter</b> <b>etching.</b> They were caused by the sputter process and were independent of grain boundaries, surface contaminants and inclusions. The sputtering rate of stainless steel was highly dependent on the background pressure which should be kept below 10 - 5 Torr. <b>Sputter</b> <b>etching</b> improved the performance of stainless steel used as a solar selective surface.

On the other hand, planar channel waveguides, such as slab waveguides, ridge waveguides and slot waveguides, are typically fabricated by various processing approaches, e. g., deposition, <b>sputtering,</b> <b>etching,</b> lithography and so on, at relatively low temperatures. Compact microstructured planar waveguide devices play important roles in various technical areas including telecoms application, sensing, and biomedical diagnostics and imaging. In comparison with planar waveguides, optical fibers have numerous advantages, e. g., long length, low cost per unit length due to the high yield, and low propagation loss.

40|$|Abstract. Reactive {{ion etching}} of barium {{strontium}} titanate (BST) thin films using an SF 6 /Ar plasma has been studied. BST surfaces {{before and after}} etching were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to investigate the reaction ion etching mechanism, and chemical reactions had occurred between the F plasma and the Ba, Sr and Ti metal species. Fluorides of these metals were formed and some remained on the surface during the etching process. Ti can be removed completely by chemical reaction because the TiF 4 by-product is volatile. Minor quantities of Ti-F could still be detected by narrow scan X-ray photoelectron spectra, which {{was thought to be}} present in metal-oxy-fluoride(Metal-O-F). These species were investigated from O 1 s spectra, and a fluoride-rich surface was formed during etching because the high boiling point BaF 2 and SrF 2 residues are hard to remove. The etching rate was limited to 14. 28 nm/min.

40|$|Atomic {{mixing and}} {{preferential}} sputtering impose a depth resolution {{limit on the}} use of sputter sectioning to measure the composition of metal–semiconductor interfaces. Experimental evidence obtained with the Pt–Si system is used to demonstrate ion‐induced atomic mixing and then its effect on <b>sputter</b> <b>etching</b> and depth profiling. Starting with discrete layer structures, a relatively low ion dose (≳ 3 × 10 ^(15) cm^(− 2)) first produced a mixed surface layer with thickness comparable to the ion range. Higher ion doses then result in successive <b>sputter</b> <b>etching</b> and continual atomic mixing over a constant surface layer thickness.

40|$|The {{formation}} of arrays of vertically aligned nanotips on a moderately heated (up to 500 degrees C) Si surface exposed to reactive low-temperature radio frequency (RF) Ar+H(2) plasmas is studied. It is {{demonstrated that the}} nanotip surface density, aspect ratio and height dispersion strongly depend on the substrate temperature, discharge power, and gas composition. It is shown that nanotips with aspect ratios from 2. 0 to 4. 0 can only be produced at a higher RF power density (41. 7 mW cm(- 3)) and a hydrogen content of about 60 %, and that larger aspect ratios can be achieved at substrate temperatures of about 300 degrees C. The use of higher (up to 500 degrees C) temperatures leads to a decrease of the aspect ratio but promotes the {{formation of}} more uniform arrays with the height dispersion decreasing to 1. 5. At lower (approximately 20 mW cm(- 3)) RF power density, only semispherical nanodots can be produced. Based on these experimental results, a nanotip formation scenario is proposed suggesting that <b>sputtering,</b> <b>etching,</b> hydrogen termination, and atom/radical re-deposition are the main concurrent mechanisms for the nanostructure formation.
