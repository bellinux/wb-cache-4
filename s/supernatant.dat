25|$|If {{the protein}} of {{interest}} is not secreted by the organism into the surrounding solution, {{the first step of}} each purification process is the disruption of the cells containing the protein. Depending on how fragile the protein is and how stable the cells are, one could, for instance, use one of the following methods: i) repeated freezing and thawing, ii) sonication, iii) homogenization by high pressure (French press), iv) homogenization by grinding (bead mill), and v) permeabilization by detergents (e.g. Triton X-100) and/or enzymes (e.g. lysozyme).

25|$|In Tamil Nadu, a plain rice porridge, or {{the thick}} <b>supernatant</b> water from overcooked rice, {{is known as}} kanji. Kanji or Congee is also {{prepared}} with different grains available {{in different parts of}} Tamil Nadu, for example minor millet or pearl millet, finger millet, broken wheat, maize.The people of Kerala also call this preparation of rice in a watery state kanji, and it is eaten as a porridge with green lentils or chutney. Kanji is prepared with rice or ragi. Nuts and spices are added to the kanji depending on the economic status or health requirements. Rice kanji is prepared by boiling rice in large amounts of water. To this preparation, either milk and sugar (usually jaggery) or curd (yoghurt) and salt are added. Ragi kanji is prepared by drying ragi sprouts in shade, and then grinding them into a smooth powder. This powder is added to water and cooked. Milk and brown sugar are added to this cooked preparation for taste. Ragi kanji can be given to infants after six months. Another kanji preparation uses jevvarisi (sago in English, sabudana in Hindi) in kanji. Sago is dry roasted and powdered with/ without sugar. Powdered sago is boiled in water until cooked. This is eaten by all ages from adults to infants as young as three months.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} a possible action of human mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) <b>supernatants</b> on rosette formation between T lymphocytes and sheep red blood cells. The <b>supernatants</b> of MLC between unrelated donors A and B were compared to the <b>supernatants</b> of A or B lymphocytes cultured alone for periods between 1 hr and 4 days. Lymphocytes of a third unrelated donor C were incubated at 37 °C with the various <b>supernatants,</b> and rosette formation was measured by both the active T-rosette assay and the total T-rosette assay. It was found that <b>supernatants</b> of MLC increased the percentage of active rosettes (TEa) compared to A or B <b>supernatants.</b> There was no increase in the total T rosettes (TEt). The effect was detectable when lymphocytes were cultured for only 1 hr. At Day 4, the TEa were 24. 1 ± 7. 6 % for A <b>supernatants,</b> 24. 2 ± 7. 1 % for B <b>supernatants,</b> and 36. 8 ± 8. 5 % for AB <b>supernatants</b> (MLC). The TEt were, respectively, 66. 6 ± 4. 0, 65. 0 ± 4. 4, and 66. 0 ± 1. 8 %. Cycloheximide and mitomycin treatment of A and B lymphocytes abolished the rosetting property of MLC <b>supernatants.</b> Heat also destroyed this property. It is concluded that MLC <b>supernatants</b> contain a factor termed the rosetting factor (RF), actively synthesized by lmyphocytes, which is capable of acting on a subpopulation of T lymphocytes. This factor may be of importance in immune competence in view of the known correlation of TEa with cellular immunity. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Antibiotics release {{inflammatory}} fragments, such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PG), {{from the}} cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus. In this study, we exposed S. aureus cultures {{to a number}} of β-lactam antibiotics (imipenem, flucloxacillin, and cefamandole) and protein synthesis-inhibiting antibiotics (erythromycin, clindamycin, and gentamicin) and investigated whether <b>supernatants</b> of these cultures differ in their capacity to stimulate endothelial cells (EC). After 24 h of incubation, endothelial adhesiveness for leukocytes, surface expression of various adhesion molecules, and secretion of the chemokines interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) were measured. <b>Supernatants</b> of β-lactam-exposed cultures (designated β-lactam <b>supernatants)</b> enhanced the adhesiveness of EC for granulocytes, whereas those of protein synthesis-inhibiting antibiotic-exposed cultures (designated protein synthesis-inhibitor <b>supernatants)</b> did not. This hyperadhesiveness coincided with a higher intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 expression {{on the surface of the}} stimulated EC. In addition, EC stimulated with β-lactam <b>supernatants</b> secreted significantly higher concentrations of the chemokines IL- 8 and MCP- 1 than those stimulated with protein synthesis-inhibitor <b>supernatants.</b> The finding that the concentrations of LTA and PG in β-lactam <b>supernatants</b> were much higher than those in protein synthesis-inhibitor <b>supernatants</b> suggests that the observed differences in stimulatory effect between these <b>supernatants</b> are a result of differences in the release of cell wall fragments, although the presence of other stimulatory factors in the <b>supernatants</b> cannot be excluded. In conclusion, our results argue for a release of LTA and PG from S. aureus after exposure to β-lactam antibiotics that enhances the development of a systemic inflammatory response by stimulating EC such that adhesiveness for granulocytes is increased and large amounts of IL- 8 and MCP- 1 are secreted...|$|R

500|$|Stable carbenes {{are very}} reactive, {{and so the}} minimum amount of {{handling}} is desirable using air-free techniques. However, provided rigorously dry, relatively non-acidic and air-free materials are used, stable carbenes are reasonably robust to handling per se. By way of example, a stable carbene prepared from potassium hydride can be filtered through a dry celite pad to remove excess KH (and resulting salts) from the reaction. On a relatively small scale, a suspension containing a stable carbene in solution can be allowed to settle and the <b>supernatant</b> solution pushed through a dried membrane syringe filter. Stable carbenes are readily soluble in non-polar solvents such as hexane, and so typically recrystallisation of stable carbenes can be difficult, due to the unavailability of suitable non-acidic polar solvents. Air-free sublimation as shown right {{can be an effective}} method of purification, although temperatures below 60°C under high vacuum are preferable as these carbenes are relatively volatile and also could begin to decompose at these higher temperatures. Indeed, sublimation in some cases can give single crystals suitable for X-ray analysis. However, strong complexation to metal ions like lithium will in most cases prevent sublimation.|$|E
