50|$|Hot rolling is a {{metalworking}} {{process that}} occurs above the recrystallization {{temperature of the}} material. After the grains deform during processing, they recrystallize, which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening. The starting material is usually large pieces of metal, like semi-finished casting products, such as slabs, blooms, and billets. If these products came from a continuous casting operation the products are usually fed directly into the rolling mills at the proper temperature. In smaller operations the material starts at room temperature and must be heated. This is done in a gas- or oil-fired <b>soaking</b> <b>pit</b> for larger workpieces and for smaller workpieces induction heating is used. As the material is worked the temperature must be monitored {{to make sure it}} remains above the recrystallization temperature. To maintain a safety factor a finishing temperature is defined above the recrystallization temperature; this is usually 50 to 100 °C (90 to 180 °F) above the recrystallization temperature. If the temperature does drop below this temperature the material must be re-heated before more hot rolling.|$|E
40|$|Model {{predictions}} of the thermal and stress evolution in steel ingots, combined with a metallurgical study, have confirmed the mechanism of formation of off-comer panel cracks. The cracks are gener-ated initially in the subsurface of the ingot {{during the early stages}} of reheating in the <b>soaking</b> <b>pit.</b> The volume change associated with ~/-c ~ transformation {{plays a major role in}} the generation of the tensile stresses as in the case of the mid-face panel cracks. Early in the reheating, a subsurface two-phase zone of c ~ and 3 /contracts within a surrounding field of austenite and is placed in tension. Crack formation is enhanced by the precipitation of AIN which embrittles the steel. The subsurface cracks subsequently may penetrate to the surface of the ingot immediately upon its withdrawal from the <b>soaking</b> <b>pit</b> owing to the generation of surface tensile stresses caused by rapid cooling of the in-got surface. Measures to minimize formation of off-corner panel cracks, therefore, include reducing air cooling time (prior to charging ingots to the <b>soaking</b> <b>pit)</b> to prevent 3 ~-c ~ transformation, reheating the ingots slowly in an initially cold <b>soaking</b> <b>pit</b> to reduce the tensile stresses, increasing the air cooling time substantially to force the cracks farther from the surface, and minimizing soaking times and temperatures.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{correlation}} between segregation of carbide forming elements (vanadium) and void initiation and propagation in low-alloyed Cr-Mo steels. The internal defects are created during blooms straightening in radial type of casting machine due to strain deformation field in the temperature range characteristic for vanadium nitride, carbide or carbonitride precipitation. Based on the statistical analysis (1097 continuously cast blooms) of three low-alloyed Cr-Mo steel variants with different vanadium content, we conclude that the void occurence is strongly associated {{with the level of}} vanadium content. The experiments performed by means of microstructural, fractographic investigations and microchemical point analysis proved that preffered areas for void initiation are interdendritic segregations in the core of bloom. We observed vanadium carbide precipitates that are situated close to the cracks, whereas the content of vanadium was 7, 5 times more then in an average smelt composition. The further development of defects is connected with fast heating up to the austenization temperature in <b>soaking</b> <b>pit.</b> Our results confirm that marked decrease of defects can be achieved by optimization of production process, i. e. optimized casting speed, steel overheat above the liquidus temperature and/or application of M-EMS...|$|E
40|$|The Babcock & Wilcox Company (B&W) has {{completed}} {{a program to}} design, construct, install, and field test a ceramic-based high-temperature burner-duct-recuperator (HTBDR) in an industrial setting. The unit was capable of operating in corrosive, high temperature (2250 oF) flue gas streams. The HTBDR was successfully tested in a steel <b>soaking</b> <b>pit</b> at B&W's Tubular Products Division in Koppel, Pennsylvania. The ceramic stage consisted of 50 bayonet style ceramic tube-in-tube assemblies supported by an insulated metallic tubesheet and sealed with a ceramic fiber product. The heat exchanger was designed to take maximum advantage of radiation heat transfer, minimize pressure drops on both the air and flue sides, and minimize thermal stresses and fouling. Modeling of the bayonet assemblies determined the outer-to-inner tube spacing to optimize the air-side pressure drop and heat transfer within the tubes. During the 1400 hour operation prior to plant closing, the ceramic stage performed well with no material related problems or air-to-flue leakage. Maximum preheat air produced was 1425 ?F with a flue gas temperature of 2250 oF. Measured fuel savings of 17 - 24 % were obtained over the previous recuperated (metallic heat exchanger) system. This projects a savings of 41 % for an unrecuperated furnace. A simple payback analysis indicated acceptable payback for installation in unrecuperated furnaces but unacceptable payback for recuperated furnaces at today's low gas prices. ...|$|E
40|$|Operating {{conditions}} of the furnaces has the major effect {{on the quality of}} steel during steel production process. Furnaces also are the biggest energy consumer in the whole production process  which make them a center of concern, {{in order to get to}} the most optimized condition through both energy and quality aspects. <b>Soaking</b> <b>pit</b> furnaces are for heating steel ingots before rolling, in order to provide convenient conditions for ingots for further procedures. These batch furnaces are characterized by heat and temperature conditions that vary in time. The structure permits rapid heating of the metal inside the furnace, since heat is supplied over the entire surface of the ingot. One serious problem that these furnaces might contain is the existence of non-uniform temperature gradient inside the chamber that causes different temperature distribution on the ingots surface which leads to a bad surface quality of them, considering further rolling process. As the first step through obtaining the best temperature gradient inside the chamber, is to ensure the exact temperature condition in the current running procedure. In here as the first step through the problem solving of these furnaces, temperature profile, radiation profile and other effective parameters are investigated with the aid of CFD software. The simulation is done by ICEM and FLUENT programs for geometry and mesh designing, and modeling in respect. Modeling is based on four main steps:         I.             Modeling of the furnace chamber geometry and applying appropriate mesh style with ICEM       II.             Modeling the chamber with fluent, and taking the results (case 0)     III.             Modeling of six cases with different excess air, in order to investigate the best λ magnitude     IV.             Modeling of six cases with different burner capacities in order to investigate its affection on combustion parameter...|$|E

40|$|Cities in the {{developing}} countries have multiple modes of human and animal waste treatment and disposal that finally decide the overall impact on the urban ecosystem, and these have been studied {{for the city of}} Bangalore. Four modes are found, namely underground sewage systems, decentralized <b>soak</b> <b>pits</b> and septic tanks, open defecation and a miniscule effort at composting. The extent of N released per unit area is high, ranging between 0. 44 and 1. 4 t $ha^{- 1 }$ of the urban landscape. In this study the N release and outflow have been estimated. The N entering or flowing in the lithosphere,hydrosphere and in wastewater streams forms the major component. The pool size has first been determined. The size and movement through these pools were estimated with a view to determine the state of the N cycle {{and if there is a}} cause for alarm in similar cities in other developing countries. N contribution from human waste (excreta and urine) forms the singlelargest influx and sewage flowing out of the city forms the single largest efflux of N pool.

40|$|In most {{integrated}} works, ingots {{are used}} as an intermediate form during the production of steel. These ingots, produced by pouring molten steel into molds, are too large {{to be used as}} input for the finishing mills which produce steel products. Hence, more manageable forms (blooms, billets and slabs) are rolled from the ingots by primary mills. The necessity of having uniformly hot steel, provided by a battery of <b>soaking</b> <b>pits,</b> limits the production capacity of any primary mill. At times there is no hot steel and the mill comes into "nothing hot" delays. It is desirable to reduce these delays to a minimum through proper management of the system. One way of doing so is to properly control the charging into the <b>soaking</b> <b>pits</b> of ingots from the queue which builds up there. The paper investigates the properties of this problem which can be considered in two parts. Firstly, when there are ingots of various temperatures in the queue, which should be charged when space becomes available in the pits? Secondly, if space becomes available when there are no hot ingots in the queue, should the empty pit be kept idle waiting for more to arrive or should it be charged with cold ingots which though readily available require considerably longer to prepare for rolling? There is the possibility of inserted idle time. A model is made of the ingot queue-soaking pit-rolling mill system. The properties of the optimal control policy for the ingot queue are investigated using Markov programming. Results are presented which illustrate its complex state dependent nature. ...|$|R
