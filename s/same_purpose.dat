5|$|The {{streams of}} the Peak District have been dammed to provide {{headwater}} for numerous water driven mills; weirs {{have been built}} across the rivers for the <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{is added}} to many food products, {{including}} breakfast cereals, {{as a source of}} zinc, a necessary nutrient. (Zinc sulfate is also used for the <b>same</b> <b>purpose.)</b> Some prepackaged foods also include trace amounts of ZnO even if it is not intended as a nutrient.|$|E
5|$|A man {{was sent}} to New York to receive payment for the stock, but Grey had {{forgotten}} that he had ever stopped at Martha's Vineyard. Colonel Beriah Norton made two special trips to London for the <b>same</b> <b>purpose,</b> and at one time {{he was given a}} hearing in Parliament. Very little was accomplished in these two trips to England.|$|E
50|$|The {{previous}} Companies Act 1913 was {{in practice}} for the <b>same</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Addition {{of boron}} nitride to silicon nitride {{ceramics}} improves the thermal shock {{resistance of the}} resulting material. For the <b>same</b> <b>purpose,</b> BN is added also to silicon nitride-alumina and titanium nitride-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and zirconia, borosilicate glasses, glass ceramics, enamels, and composite ceramics with titanium boride-boron nitride, titanium boride-aluminium nitride-boron nitride, and silicon carbide-boron nitride composition.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars {{are also}} {{affected}} by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and {{only a small percentage}} of the butterfly eggs laid ever reach adulthood. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis has been used in sprays to reduce damage to crops by the caterpillars of the large white butterfly, and the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has proved effective for the <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even in Turkey {{a system}} of weights similar to the European apothecaries' system {{was used for the}} <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b> For medical {{purposes}} the tcheky (approx. 320g) was divided in 100 drachms, and the drachm in (16 killos or) 64 grains. This is close to the classical Greek weight system, where a mina (corresponding roughly to a Roman libra) was also divided into 100 drachms.|$|E

50|$|The wood is valuable, {{similar to}} that of other white oaks, and used for the <b>same</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|R
5|$|I {{might have}} adduced for this <b>same</b> <b>purpose</b> the {{differences}} between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.|$|E
5|$|Matthias convoked the Diet to make {{preparations}} for an anti-Ottoman campaign in 1466. For the <b>same</b> <b>purpose,</b> he received subsidies from Pope Paul II. However, Matthias had realized that no substantial aid {{could be expected}} from the Christian powers and tacitly gave up his anti-Ottoman foreign policy. He did not invade Ottoman territory and the Ottomans did not make major incursions into Hungary, implying that he signed a peace treaty with Mehmed II's envoy who arrived in Hungary in 1465.|$|E
5|$|Metal borides {{are used}} for coating tools through {{chemical}} vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition. Implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys, through ion implantation or ion beam deposition, results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness. Laser alloying has also been successfully used for the <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b> These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools, and their (treated) surfaces have similar properties {{to those of the}} bulk boride.|$|E

50|$|Although related (due {{to being}} used for the <b>same</b> <b>purposes),</b> {{transparent}} colors and alpha channels are techniques which do not involve the image pixel mixage by binary masking.|$|R
5|$|Opinions {{criticizing the}} site rapidly spread {{throughout}} the blogosphere around early 2007. Schlafly appeared on radio programs Today on BBC Radio 4 and All Things Considered on NPR to discuss the site around that time. In May 2008, Schlafly {{and one of his}} homeschooled students appeared on the CBC program The Hour for the <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Crusades {{also led}} to the {{introduction}} of machicolations into Western architecture. Until the 13thcentury, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed the <b>same</b> <b>purpose</b> as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the East long before the arrival of the Crusaders, and perhaps as early as {{the first half of the}} 8thcentury in Syria.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of occupational debris like ceramic sherds over the bones was {{not unique to}} the site but common in chambered tombs from southern England. On {{the basis of an}} example discovered at Kit's Coty House, Ashbee thought it apparent that the contents of the Coldrum's chamber would have been compartmentalised by medial slabs, which served the <b>same</b> <b>purpose</b> as the side chambers of West Kennet and Wayland's Smithy.|$|E
50|$|In cooking, the {{bilberry}} {{fruit is}} commonly used for the <b>same</b> <b>purposes</b> as the American blueberry such as pies, cakes, jams, muffins, cookies, sauces, syrups, juices, and candies.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} a crooked knife was {{apparently}} inspired by the incisors of a beaver, which in earlier times were mounted in a handle and used for the <b>same</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A captive {{helicopter}} is {{a helicopter}} which is {{tethered to the}} ground with a rope, as with a captive balloon. Captive helicopters can be used for the <b>same</b> <b>purposes</b> as captive balloons.|$|R
5|$|These {{statistics}} do {{not include}} results from the Allsvenskan play-offs (held between 1982 and 1990), but those from Mästerskapsserien (held in 1991 and 1992) are included. The Allsvenskan play-off round was held in cup format {{at the end of}} the league season to decide the national champions, while Mästerskapsserien was an additional league stage with the <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
5|$|A castle {{here could}} guard {{several of the}} main {{strategic}} routes and form part {{of a network of}} strongholds of the Norman kingdom, in the former Danish Mercia, roughly the area today referred to as the East Midlands, to control the country internally. Also it was a centre from which troops could be sent to repel Scandinavian landings anywhere on the coast from the Trent to the Welland, to a large extent, by using the roads which the Romans had constructed for the <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Armies facing {{service in}} {{different}} theatres may need several different camouflage uniforms. Separate issues of temperate/jungle and desert camouflage uniforms are common. Patterns can {{to some extent}} be adapted to different terrains by adding means of fastening pieces of vegetation to the uniform. Helmets often have netting covers; some jackets have small loops for the <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b> Being able to find appropriate camouflage vegetation or in other ways modify the issued battle uniform to suit the local terrain is an important skill for infantry soldiers.|$|E
50|$|Tonarigumi {{were also}} {{organized}} in territories occupied by Japan, including Manchukuo, Mengjiang, and the Wang Jingwei Government, {{and later in}} occupied territories of Southeast Asia (Such as the Indonesian RT/RW system) with the <b>same</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nettle stems {{contain a}} bast fibre {{that has been}} {{traditionally}} used for the <b>same</b> <b>purposes</b> as linen and is produced by a similar retting process. Unlike cotton, nettles grow easily without pesticides. The fibres are coarser, however.|$|R
50|$|The 1AESS tape drives had {{approximately}} {{four times}} {{the density of the}} original ones in 1ESS, and were used for some of the <b>same</b> <b>purposes</b> as in other mainframe computers, including program updates and loading special programs.|$|R
5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is similar}} to most other visual novels for the PC, with the {{controls}} limited to the mouse and the only interactions being clicking to forward the game's narrative or to choose between multiple plot choices. The keyboard {{can also be used}} instead of the mouse, with the 'enter' key serving the <b>same</b> <b>purpose</b> as clicking. The save button can be employed at any point during the game, which also features several pages of save slots, allowing gameplay to be easily picked up from prior to a choice the player made. An arrow button in the upper right corner also allows the player to skip dialogue and interactions they have already experienced.|$|E
5|$|Longleat Estate has fenced off a {{large part}} of its land and has {{introduced}} goats, as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the gorge until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release a flock of sheep on its side of the gorge for the <b>same</b> <b>purpose,</b> but will first consult local residents and interested parties on whether to fence off the gorge or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. There is already a small flock of feral Soay sheep in the gorge.|$|E
50|$|Although related (due to {{they are}} used for the <b>same</b> <b>purposes),</b> image bit masks and alpha {{channels}} are techniques which not involve the use of palettes nor transparent color at all, but off-image added extra binary data layers.|$|R
25|$|Creatine {{is sold in}} {{a variety}} of forms, {{including}} creatine monohydrate and creatine ethyl ester, amongst others. Though all types of creatine are sold for the <b>same</b> <b>purposes,</b> there are subtle differences between them, such as price and necessary dosage.|$|R
50|$|Campbell's 2014 {{decision}} {{is similar to}} the 2011 decision by Mark Davies, Bishop of Shrewsbury, to entrust the then-closed landmark Church of St Peter, Paul and Philomena's, New Brighton to the Institute of Christ the King for the <b>same</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|R
