MethodsThe sample in this retrospective study was obtained from the records of the university hospital, patients who had to undergo ankylosis treatment by alloplastic or autogenous graft between March 2001 and October 2005. Pre- and post-operative assessment included a throughout history and physical examination to determine the cause of ankylosis, the Maximum mouth opening (MMO), etiology and type of ankylosis, recurrence rate and presence of facial nerve paralysis. ResultsThe mean MMO in the pre-operative period was 9. 6 mm (0 mm to 17 mm) and in the post-operative period it was of 31. 33 mm (14 mm to 41 mm), there was no facial nerve paralysis and there was recurrence in just one case.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new NURBS {{modeling}} technique, called NURBS fusion and present a complete algorithm for NURBS fusion.

The <b>surface</b> <b>fusion</b> algorithm performs in three steps. First, surface/surface intersection is computed by a subdivision based algorithm, which gives intersecting point pairs in parameter domains. Second, base surfaces are trimmed “excessively” along intersection curves to eliminate the intersected parts and make gaps that will be filled by the auxiliary connection surfaces. Finally, bicubic B-spline auxiliary surfaces are constructed to connect the base surfaces in a smooth fashion. Our algorithm is concise, fast, and it produces low degree NURBS results compatible with most data-exchange standards...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMyoblast fusion is {{essential}} for the formation and regeneration of skeletal muscle. In a genetic screen for regulators of muscle development in Drosophila, we discovered a gene encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, called loner, which is required for myoblast fusion. Loner localizes to subcellular sites of fusion and acts downstream of cell <b>surface</b> <b>fusion</b> receptors by recruiting the small GTPase ARF 6 and stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange. Accordingly, a dominant-negative ARF 6 disrupts myoblast fusion in Drosophila embryos and in mammalian myoblasts in culture, mimicking the fusion defects caused by loss of Loner. Loner and ARF 6, which also control the proper membrane localization of another small GTPase, Rac, are key components of a cellular apparatus required for myoblast fusion and muscle development. In muscle cells, this fusigenic mechanism is coupled to fusion receptors; in other fusion-competent cell types it may be triggered by different upstream signals...|$|E

When cells are incubated with cellulose-bound SCF-CBDCex, activated receptors and SCF-CBDCex co-localize on the cellulose matrix.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework of}} surface modeling from multi-view range and color images. The input to the algorithms are pairs of triangle meshes and color images, and each pair is obtained by a single-view scanning. In the proposed framework, the triangle meshes from raw data are first processed by the novel surface denoising algorithm based on area decreasing flow, which avoids the difficulty in curvature estimation of mean curvature flow. The proposed adaptive triangle mesh smoothing algorithm is based on crease edge strength of each vertex and uses tensor voting of the normal vector field inside a geodesic window. Surfaces from multiple views are then integrated into a single 3 D model. Two integration approaches are discussed, {{which are based on}} mesh zippering and implicit <b>surface</b> <b>fusion,</b> respectively. Color images are incorporated to generate textured models.

The coinjection of Th 1 -type cytokine-expressing plasmids (gamma interferon, interleukin- 2, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) mostly abolished protection and boosting of MSP 119 -specific antibodies.
