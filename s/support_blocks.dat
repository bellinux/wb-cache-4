50|$|More recently, {{with the}} {{invention}} of the Wood-Mizer in 1982, portable bandsaw mills represented a dramatic shift in design. Unlike traditional mills, they used a thin-kerf blade of the type used on a band saw rather than a circular blade, which reduced weight and cost, and reduced the size and weight of the bearings and <b>support</b> <b>blocks.</b> The smaller kerf on these blades dramatically increased the yield from a given log. Use of band blades also allowed for a different design where the head, consisting of the blade and a power source, moves back and forth while the log remains stationary. This is in contrast to traditional mills where the log moves on a trolley while the blade remains fixed. Aside from the original Wood-Mizer company, many companies now manufacture and sell personal and portable sawmills.|$|E

40|$|As {{dairy farming}} {{businesses}} expand and {{the push for}} productivity improvement continues there is increasing pressure to maximise milksolids production from the milking platform. A consequence of this production drive {{is the need for}} off-farm grazing for replacement stock and cows during winter.

40|$|In recent years, verandas {{have become}} {{increasingly}} larger and are more often built separately from the main building. The lateral stability has hence become a problem. This research investigates a concept to ensure it without any visual adaptations for the user. The concept uses <b>support</b> <b>blocks</b> ensuring a uniformly distributed pressure zone contributing to a redistribution of the horizontal load in the window’s plane and an increase of the whole system’s stiffness. One window is mainly composed of a glass matrix surrounded by an aluminum frame. Internally to the frame, connecting elements made of aluminum are used. In the present research, {{on the basis of}} tests, the stiffness of the various parts composing one window was evaluated. These tests firstly consisted of separate tests on the connection elements (both T- and corner-connections) and on the <b>support</b> <b>blocks.</b> The aluminum frame that surrounds the glass will exert a major influence on the stiffness of the whole. Therefore, in a second step, full frames were tested. Both empty frames and frames filled with aluminum and glass were tested.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the design}} and {{fabrication}} of the main components for the W 7 -X stellarator a number of technical challenges and severe problems had to be overcome {{many of which are}} considered relevant for other machines of similar size and complexity. Massive supporting structures are used to sustain the large electromagnetic loads. Finite element analyses (FEA) were used to design the main support structures. However, when the original FEA models were improved and refined, structural weaknesses showed up requiring reinforcement after components had already been fabricated. Some highly loaded elements are qualified by testing of instrumented prototypes. This proved to be very important to find and eradicate weaknesses. The coils for W 7 -X {{have been the subject of}} considerable delivery delays due to a variety of problems. In addition to the reinforcement of the coil <b>support</b> <b>blocks</b> on the non-planar coils, refined FEA showed that the planar coils undergo excessive outof-plane bending. This has been corrected by additional shear pins to stiffen the casings. In an early stage it was decided that all 70 coils for W 7 -X should be cold tested. The cold tests have shown that of all the coils tested thus far the specified superconductive behaviour was according to specification. However, a number of faults have been found. These include cold leaks, poor performance of instrumentation, some of which is considered important for machine operation, as well as electrical insulation faults. After cool-down and warm-up in a test cryostat all coils are tested under Paschen conditions. Initially many non-planar coils did not pass this test. After returning to the factory detailed investigations have been carried out, repair procedures have been qualified and applied. Loss of time may partially be compensated by accelerating the assembly of the machine through the use of parallel assembly lines. 1...|$|E
40|$|Traditional dairy {{wintering}} {{practice in}} the lower South Island of New Zealand has been to graze brassica crops in situ. This practice has been under increasing scrutiny from local Regional Councils due to the relatively high nitrogen (N) leaching losses from this component of the whole farm system. Alternative wintering options to reduce N leaching losses that are currently available to farmers (such as barns and permanent wintering pads) are high cost and involve a large capital investment. In this work a new wintering system (termed a ‘portable pad’) was developed for use on <b>support</b> <b>blocks</b> (which can be located many kilometres from the milking platform) as an interim measure for reducing N leaching losses that is low cost and low input. This system is designed as a mitigation strategy that is available for use immediately while research investigates more permanent solutions. This system is a hybrid of the traditional crop grazing system and an off-paddock system, where effluent is captured. It makes use {{of the advantages of}} each of the original systems utilising the low cost feed source of the brassica crops, grazed in situ, while also utilising the benefits of duration controlled grazing with its associated effluent capture and irrigation at low rates. The aim of the research was to generate whole system N leaching loss values {{for each of the three}} farm systems investigated (crop wintering, deep-litter wintering barn, and portable pad). Field and laboratory research was conducted to fill identified knowledge gaps such that system N loss values could be estimated. OVERSEER Nutrient Budget software tool was used in conjunction with measured and modelled (APSIM) data to simulate whole farm N leaching loss values for the three farm systems investigated. Nitrogen leaching losses from the portable pad and barn systems were between 5 and 26 % and between 13 and 26 % lower, respectively, than the crop wintering system...|$|E
40|$|The Amethyst hydro {{project was}} {{proposed}} on the West Coast of New Zealand as {{an answer to}} the increasing demand for power in the area. A previous hydro project in the area was deemed unviable to reopen so the current project was proposed. The scheme involves diverting water from the Amethyst Ravine down through penstocks in a 1040 m tunnel and out to a powerhouse on the floodplain of the Wanganui River. The tunnel section of the scheme is the focus of this thesis. It has been excavated using drill and blast methods and is horseshoe shaped, with 3. 5 x 3. 5 m dimensions. The tunnel was excavated into Haast Schist through its whole alignment, although the portal section was driven into debris flow material. The tunnel alignment and outflow portal is approximately 2 km Southeast of the Alpine Fault, the right lateral thrusting surface expression of a tectonically complex and major plate boundary. The Amethyst Ravine at the intake portal is fault controlled, and this continuing regional tectonic regime has {{had an impact on the}} engineering strength of the rockmass through the orientation of defects. The rock is highly metamorphosed (gneissic in places) and is cut through with a number of large shears. Scanline mapping of the tunnel was completed along with re-logging of some core and data collection of all records kept during tunneling. Structural analysis was undertaken, along with looking at groundwater flow data over the length of the tunnel, in order to break the tunnel up into domains of similar rock characteristics and investigate the rockmass strength of the tunnel from first principles. A structural model, hydrological model and rockmass model were assembled, each showing the change in characteristics over the length of the tunnel. The data was then modeled using the 3 DEC numerical modelling software. It was found that the shear zones form major structural controls on the rockmass, and schistosity changes drastically to either side of these zones. Schistosity in general steepens in dip up the tunnel and dip direction becomes increasingly parallel to the tunnel alignment. Water is linked to shear position, and a few major incursions of water (up to 205 l/s) can be linked to large (1. 6 m thick) shear zones. Modeling illustrated that the tunnel is most likely to deform through the invert, with movement also capable of occurring in the right rib above the springline and to a lesser extent in the left rib below the springline. This is due to the angle of schistosity and the interaction of joints, which act as cut off planes. The original support classes for tunnel construction were based on Barton’s Q-system, but due to complicated interactions between shears, foliations and joint sets, the designed support classes have been inadequate in places, leading to increased cost due to the use of supplementary support. Modeling has shown that the halos of bolts are insufficient due to the > 1 m spacing, which fails to <b>support</b> <b>blocks</b> which can be smaller than this in places due to the close spacing of the schistosity. It is recommended that a more broad support type be used in place of discreet solutions such as rock bolts, in order to most efficiently optimize the support classes and most effectively support the rock mass...|$|E
