40|$|A LOX/LH 2 high/variable {{mixture ratio}} booster upper stage is described. The engine has high thrust-weight ratio as a booster and high {{specific}} impulse as an upper stage engine. Operation at high mixture ratio utilizes the propellants at high bulk density. The engine may use multiple turbopump-preburners for higher thrust ratings. The engine uses the full flow cycle to obtain minimum turbine inlet temperatures for a given chamber pressure and to avoid interpropellant shaft seals and other single point failure modes. A portion of the liquid hydrogen is used to regeneratively cool the thrust chamber assembly. The warmed hydrogen coolant is then used to drive the fuel boost turbopump. All propellants arrive at the gas-gas injector ready to burn. Shear mixing of the parallel flowing high velocity, low density fuel-rich gases with the high density, low velocity oxidizer-rich gases provides complete combustion with a modest chamber volume. Combustion stability is assured by the injection of the heated fuel-rich gases and the comparatively low volume ratio of the propellants before and after combustion. The high area ratio nozzle skirt is fitted with a low area ratio nozzle <b>skirt</b> <b>insert</b> for optimum low altitude performance. The overall engine characteristics make it a candidate for ALS, Shuttle-C, LRB, and SSTO applications...|$|E

60|$|And now purple {{is being}} worn. You notice {{it on the}} streets. Of course other colors are quite stylish as well--in fact, I saw a lovely thing {{the other day in}} olive green albatross, with a triple-lapped flounce <b>skirt</b> trimmed with <b>insert</b> squares of silk, and a draped fichu of lace opening over a shirred vest and double puff sleeves with a lace band holding two {{gathered}} frills--but you see lots of purple too. Oh, yes, you do; just take a walk down Twenty-third street any afternoon.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{establishing}} a particular chronological priority issue in the convoluted history of artificial cornea. According to existing records, the first keratoprosthesis made from polyurethane was developed by Caldwell and Jacob-Labarre in the late 1980 s. This paper demonstrates that in fact the first polyurethane keratoprosthesis was proposed and designed in 1985 by Lawrence Hirst, an Australian ophthalmologist then working in St Louis, USA. The first prototype was manufactured in January 1986 by Thermedics Inc according to Dr Hirst 2 ̆ 7 s instructions from Tecoflex, a transparent polyurethane developed by the same company. This keratoprosthesis, which also had a porous <b>skirt,</b> was <b>inserted</b> intralamellarly in a monkey cornea and followed up clinically for about 3 months. There were no significant postoperative complications, and the histology of the explant indicated proper biointegration of the prosthetic skirt within the host stromal tissue. Because of a delay {{in the manufacture of}} further prototypes and to Dr Hirst 2 ̆ 7 s decision to return to Australia, the project was eventually abandoned. As no report was published on this development, the present paper is entirely based on original documents held in Dr Hirst 2 ̆ 7 s archives...|$|R
