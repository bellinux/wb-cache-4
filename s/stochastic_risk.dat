50|$|It is {{difficult}} to compare the <b>stochastic</b> <b>risk</b> from localised exposures of {{different parts of the}} body (e.g. a chest x-ray compared to a CT scan of the head), or to compare exposures of the same body part but with different exposure patterns (e.g. a cardiac CT scan with a cardiac nuclear medicine scan). One way to avoid this problem is to simply average out a localised dose over the whole body. The problem of this approach is that the <b>stochastic</b> <b>risk</b> of cancer induction varies from one tissue to another.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} found that for <b>stochastic</b> {{radiation}} <b>risk</b> (defined as probability of cancer induction and genetic effects) consideration must be given to the type of radiation and the sensitivity of the irradiated tissues, which requires the use of modifying factors.

50|$|Equivalent dose HT is {{used for}} {{assessing}} <b>stochastic</b> health <b>risk</b> due to external radiation fields that penetrate uniformly through the whole body. However it needs further corrections when the field is applied only to part(s) of the body, or non-uniformly to measure the overall <b>stochastic</b> health <b>risk</b> to the body. To enable this a further dose quantity called effective dose must be used {{to take into account}} the varying sensitivity of different organs and tissues to radiation.|$|R
50|$|To {{represent}} <b>stochastic</b> <b>risk</b> {{the equivalent}} dose H T and effective dose E are used, and appropriate dose factors and coefficients {{are used to}} calculate these from the absorbed dose.

50|$|Radiation {{increases}} the risk of cancer and other stochastic effects at any dose. The International Commission on Radiological Protection maintains a model of these risks as a function of absorbed dose and other factors. That model calculates an effective radiation dose, measured units of rem, which is more representative of the <b>stochastic</b> <b>risk</b> than the absorbed dose in rad. In most power plant scenarios, where the radiation environment is dominated by gamma or x rays applied uniformly to the whole body, 1 rad of absorbed dose gives 1 rem of effective dose. In other situations, the effective dose in rem might be thirty times higher or thousands of time lower than the absorbed dose in rad.|$|E

50|$|The {{fundamental}} quantity is the {{absorbed dose}} (D), which {{is defined as}} the mean energy imparted ionising radiation (dE) per unit mass (dm) of material (D = dE/dm) The SI unit of absorbed dose is the gray (Gy) defined as one joule per kilogram. Absorbed dose, as a point measurement, is suitable for describing localised (i.e. partial organ) exposures such as tumour dose in radiotherapy. It may be used to estimate <b>stochastic</b> <b>risk</b> provided the amount and type of tissue involved is stated. Localised diagnostic dose levels are typically in the 0-50 mGy range. At a dose of 1 milligray (mGy) of photon radiation, each cell nucleus is crossed by an average of 1 liberated electron track.|$|E
50|$|There {{is concern}} {{that use of}} {{antibiotics}} in swine is leading {{to an increase in}} resistant bacteria. The reason for concern is that these resistant bacteria could lead to food-borne illness that is less responsive to treatment. Many proponents of the ban cite the “precautionary principle” of public health, which states if there is evidence of harm, the method in question should be avoided. Risk assessment studies have explored the possibility of harm more objectively through causal pathways and model building. These studies show a very small risk of failure of medical treatment due to resistant bacteria caused by the feeding of STA to livestock. For example, a <b>stochastic</b> <b>risk</b> assessment done in 2008 showed that the risk of consequences from an infection with drug resistant Campylobacteriosis was approximately 1 in 82 million.|$|E

The pricing model incorporates three essential {{ingredients in the}} pricing of defaultable bonds: stochastic interest rate, <b>stochastic</b> default <b>risk,</b> and call provision. Both the stochastic interest rate and the <b>stochastic</b> default <b>risk</b> are modeled as a square-root diffusion process. The default risk process is allowed to be correlated with the default-free term structure. The call provision is modeled as a constraint {{on the value of}} the bond in the finite difference scheme.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} "Option Prices in a Model with <b>Stochastic</b> Disaster <b>Risk,</b> " co-authored with Jessica Wachter, studies the {{consistency}} between the rare disaster mechanism and options data. In contrast to past work {{based on an}} iid setup, we find that a model with <b>stochastic</b> disaster <b>risk</b> can explain average implied volatilities well, despite being calibrated to consumption and aggregate market data alone. Furthermore, we extend the <b>stochastic</b> disaster <b>risk</b> model to a two-factor model and show that it can match variation in the level and slope of implied volatilities, {{as well as the}} average implied volatility curves. The second chapter "Do Rare Events Explain CDX Tranche Spreads?, " also co-authored with Jessica Wachter, investigates the rare disaster mechanism based on the data on the CDX index and its tranches. Senior tranches are essentially deep out-of-the-money options because they do not incur any losses until a large number of investment-grade firms default. Using the two-factor stochastic disaster model, we jointly explain the spreads on each CDX tranche, as well as prices on put options and the aggregate market. This paper demonstrates the importance of beliefs about rare disasters and shows a basic consistency in these beliefs across different asset markets.

Excess cancer risks have been observed in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors and in many medically and occupationally exposed groups. In general, the relative risks among Japanese survivors of atomic-bomb explosions are greater than those among comparable subsets in studies of medically exposed individuals. Cell sterilization largely accounts for the discrepancy in relative risks between these two populations, although other factors may contribute, such as the generally higher underlying cancer risks in the medical series than in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. Risks among occupationally exposed groups such as nuclear workforces and underground miners are generally consistent with those observed in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors...|$|R
