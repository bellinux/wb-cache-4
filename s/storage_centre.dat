The prisoners were engaged in cleanup and mine removal. After the departure of the prisoners the fort was transferred to the customs service, who used it as a <b>storage</b> <b>centre</b> for seized goods. A customs officer and his family lived at the fort. The fort went back to the army in 1955, which began excavations to recover the remains of those killed in 1940. A ceremony of re-interment was held in August 1955, attended by the widow of General Janssen. The fort was then abandoned for twenty years. In 1978 a local organization was formed to preserve the fort as a center for military reserve functions. By 1990 the fort had been made habitable.|$|E

The experimental ensemble of InAs dots show random telegraph noise (RTN) with tuneable relative amplitude-up to 150 %-in well defined temperature and source-drain applied voltage ranges. Our numerical simulation {{indicates that the}} RTN signature correlates with a very low number of quantum dots acting as effective charge <b>storage</b> <b>centres</b> in the structure for a given applied voltage. The modulation in relative amplitude variation can thus be associated to the altered electrostatic potential profile around such centres and enhanced carrier scattering provided by a charged dot.

The capability of the discussed multi-scale approach is demonstrated by establishing {{a link between the}} threshold voltage variability and current-voltage characteristics with various oxidation states of the POMs. The presented simulation framework and methodology can be applied not only to the POM based flash cell but they are also transferrable to the flash cells based on alternative molecules used as a storage media...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of calcium co-doping on the optical {{properties of the}} x-ray storage phosphor BaFBr: Eu 2 +, is determined by photo- stimulated luminescence techniques. It is found that the incorporation of calcium into the lattice results in a broadening of the photo- stimulation peak due to a calcium induced FA(Br, Ca 2 +) -centre with stimulation maxima at 540 and 680 nm. The optical cross-sections for the photo- stimulated process are determined by utilizing stimulation light with linearly increasing intensity. Furthermore, it is shown that the sensitivity for x-rays, i. e. the number of <b>storage</b> <b>centres</b> formed during x-ray exposure, increases up to a doping level of 1 mol% while it drops rapidly at higher calcium concentrations...|$|R

40|$|The {{geographic}} location of cloud data <b>storage</b> <b>centres</b> {{is an important}} issue for many organisations and individuals due to various regulations that require data and operations to reside in specific {{geographic location}}s. Thus, cloud users may {{want to be sure that}} their stored data have not been relocated into unknown geographic regions that may compromise the security of their stored data. Albeshri et al. (2012) combined proof of storage (POS) protocols with distance-bounding protocols to address this problem. However, their scheme involves unnecessary delay when utilising typical POS schemes due to computational overhead at the server side. The aim of this paper is to improve the basic GeoProof protocol by reducing the computation overhead at the server side. We show how this can maintain the same level of security while achieving more accurate geographic assurance...|$|R

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{has emerged}} as a major ICT trend and has been acknowledged as a key theme of industry by prominent ICT organisations. However, one of the major challenges that face the cloud computing concept and its global acceptance is how to secure and protect the data that is the property of the user. The geographic location of cloud data <b>storage</b> <b>centres</b> is an important issue for many organisations and individuals due to the regulations and laws that require data and operations to reside in specific geographic locations. Thus, data owners may need to ensure that their cloud providers do not compromise the SLA contract and move their data into another geographic location. This paper introduces an architecture for a new approach for geographic location assurance, which combines the proof of storage protocol (POS) and the distance-bounding protocol. This allows the client to check where their stored data is located, without relying on the word of the cloud provider. This architecture aims to achieve better security and more flexible geographic assurance within the environment of cloud computing...|$|R
