5|$|Gandhi's {{experiment}} with abstinence went beyond sex, and extended to food. He consulted the Jain scholar Rajchandra, whom he fondly called Raychandbhai. Rajchandra advised him that milk stimulated sexual passion. Gandhi began abstaining from cow's milk in 1912, {{and did so}} even when doctors advised him to consume milk. According to Sankar Ghose, Tagore described Gandhi as someone who did not abhor <b>sex</b> <b>or</b> women, but considered sexual life as inconsistent with his moral goals.|$|E
5|$|Hindu mythology {{has many}} {{examples}} of deities changing gender, manifesting as different genders at different times, or combining to form androgynous or hermaphroditic beings. Gods change <b>sex</b> <b>or</b> manifest as an Avatar {{of the opposite sex}} in order to facilitate sexual congress. Non-divine beings also undergo sex-changes through the actions of the gods, as the result of curses or blessings, or as the natural outcome of reincarnation.|$|E

5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with <b>sex,</b> <b>or</b> irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E
5|$|Thaddeus Stevens, a Republican {{congressman from}} Pennsylvania and ardent abolitionist, agreed that voting rights should be {{universal}}.

5|$|The hollow {{crest of}} Hypacrosaurus most likely had social functions, {{such as a}} visual signal {{allowing}} individuals to identify <b>sex</b> <b>or</b> species, and providing a resonating chamber for making noises.

5|$|Abstinence-only sex {{education}} does not reduce teenage pregnancy. Teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education, {{as compared with}} comprehensive {{sex education}}. Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal <b>sex</b> <b>or</b> deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the disease include not having <b>sex</b> <b>or</b> having few sexual {{partners}} and using condoms. Screening women at risk for chlamydial infection followed by treatment decreases the risk of PID. If the diagnosis is suspected, treatment is typically advised. Treating a woman's sexual partners should also occur. In those with mild or moderate symptoms a single injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone along with two weeks of doxycycline and possibly metronidazole by mouth is recommended. For {{those who do not}} improve after three days or who have severe disease intravenous antibiotics should be used.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental {{rights for}} Indians {{have also been}} aimed at {{overturning}} the inequalities of pre-independence social practices.

They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour (a crime). They also protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions. They are covered in Part III (Articles 12 to 35) of Indian constitution.|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected <b>sex</b> <b>or</b> intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E

Special provisions may be made for the advancements of any socially or educationally backward class or scheduled castes or scheduled tribes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors. Some viruses that infect animals, {{including}} humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct transmission is more common. Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected <b>sex</b> <b>or</b> contaminated hypodermic needles. It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.|$|E

5|$|Western jackdaws {{practice}} active food sharing– {{where the}} initiative {{for the transfer}} lies with the donor– {{with a number of}} individuals, regardless of <b>sex</b> <b>or</b> kinship. They also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food. The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship. Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species, including chimpanzees. The function of this behaviour is not fully understood, though it {{has been found to be}} detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism, reciprocity and harassment avoidance. It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement.|$|E
5|$|All post-1638 depictions {{appear to}} be based on earlier images, around the time reports {{mentioning}} dodos became rarer. Differences in the depictions led authors such as Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans and Masauji Hachisuka to speculate about sexual dimorphism, ontogenic traits, seasonal variation, and even the existence of different species, but these theories are not accepted today. Because details such as markings of the beak, the form of the tail feathers, and colouration vary from account to account, it is impossible to determine the exact morphology of these features, whether they signal age or <b>sex,</b> <b>or</b> if they even reflect reality. Dodo specialist Julian Hume argued that the nostrils of the living dodo would have been slits, as seen in the Gelderland, Cornelis Saftleven, Crocker Art Gallery, and Ustad Mansur images. According to this claim, the gaping nostrils often seen in paintings indicate that taxidermy specimens were used as models. Most depictions show that the wings were held in an extended position, unlike flighted pigeons, but similar to ratites such as the ostrich and kiwi.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes have {{prominent}} horn-like structures called ossicones, {{which are}} formed from ossified cartilage, covered in skin and fused to the skull at the parietal bones. Being vascularized, the ossicones {{may have a}} role in thermoregulation, and are also used in combat between males. Appearance is a reliable guide to the <b>sex</b> <b>or</b> age of a giraffe: the ossicones of females and young are thin and display tufts of hair on top, whereas those of adult males end in knobs and tend to be bald on top. Also, a median lump, which is more prominent in males, emerges {{at the front of the}} skull. Males develop calcium deposits that form bumps on their skulls as they age. A giraffe's skull is lightened by multiple sinuses. However, as males age, their skulls become heavier and more club-like, helping them become more dominant in combat. The upper jaw has a grooved palate and lacks front teeth. The giraffe's molars have a rough surface.|$|E

5|$|Counseling {{about sex}} and {{sexuality}} by medical professionals, psychologists, social workers, and nurses {{is a part of}} most SCI rehabilitation programs. Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are psychotherapy, peer mentorship, and social activities; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem. Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in <b>sex,</b> <b>or</b> advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia.|$|E
5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite <b>sex,</b> <b>or</b> the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E
