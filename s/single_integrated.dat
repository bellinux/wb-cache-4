5|$|Operationally, RAF Bomber Command and the U.S. Strategic Air Command cooperated in the <b>Single</b> <b>Integrated</b> Operational Plan (SIOP) {{to ensure}} {{coverage}} of all major Soviet targets from 1958, 108 aircraft of the RAF's V-Bombers were assigned targets under SIOP {{by the end}} of 1959. From 1962 onwards, two jets in every major RAF base were armed with nuclear weapons and on standby permanently under the principle of Quick Reaction Alert (QRA). Vulcans on QRA standby were to be airborne within four minutes of receiving an alert, as this was identified as the amount of time between warning of a USSR nuclear strike being launched and it arriving in Britain. The closest the Vulcan came to taking part in potential nuclear conflict was during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, where Bomber Command was moved to Alert Condition 3, an increased state of preparedness from normal operations; however, it stood down in early November.|$|E

40|$|Leaf {{reflectance}} and transmittance spectra are {{urgently needed}} in interpretation of remote sensing data and modeling energy budgets of vegetation. The measurement methods should be fast to operate and preferably portable to enable quick collection of spectral databases and in situ measurements. At the same time, the collected spectra must be comparable across measurement campaigns. We compared three different methods for acquiring leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra. These were a <b>single</b> <b>integrating</b> sphere (ASD RTS- 3 ZC), a small double integrating sphere (Ocean Optics SpectroClip-TR), and a leaf clip (PP Systems UNI 501 Mini Leaf Clip). With all methods, an ASD FieldSpec 4 spectrometer {{was used to}} measure white paper and tree leaves. <b>Single</b> and double <b>integrating</b> spheres showed comparable within-method variability in the measurements. Variability with leaf clip was slightly higher. The systematic difference in mean reflectance spectra between <b>single</b> and double <b>integrating</b> spheres was only minor (average relative difference of 1 %), whereas a large difference (14 %) was observed in transmittance. Reflectance measured with leaf clip was on average 14 % higher compared to <b>single</b> <b>integrating</b> sphere. The differences between methods influenced also spectral vegetation indices calculated from the spectra, particularly those that were designed to track small changes in spectra. Measurements with double integrating sphere were four, and with leaf clip six times as fast as with <b>single</b> <b>integrating</b> sphere, if slightly reduced signal level (integration time reduced from optimum) was allowed for the double integrating sphere. Thus, these methods are fast alternatives to a conventional <b>single</b> <b>integrating</b> sphere. However, because the differences between methods depended on the measured target and wavelength, care must be taken when comparing the leaf spectra acquired with different methods...|$|R
