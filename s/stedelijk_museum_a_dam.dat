5000|$|A concerted {{operation}} was underway to hide Jews among the local population, with various underground organizations preparing forged documents for Jews.

To hinder the Nazis, on 27 March 1943, Arondeus led a group in bombing the Amsterdam Public Records Office. Thousands of files were destroyed, and the attempt to compare forged documents with the registry was hindered. Within a week, Arondeus and {{the other members of the}} group were arrested. Twelve, including Arondeus, were executed that July by firing squad.

His Modern Art Collection more suited for the <b>Stedelijk</b> <b>Museum</b> was thus transferred to the <b>Stedelijk</b> <b>Museum.</b>|$|R
