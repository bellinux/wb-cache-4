The hyperbolic case is also structurally stable. [...] <b>Small</b> <b>changes</b> in the vector field will only produce <b>small</b> <b>changes</b> in the Poincaré map and these <b>small</b> <b>changes</b> will reflect in <b>small</b> <b>changes</b> in the position of the eigenvalues of J in the complex plane, implying that the map is still hyperbolic.|$|R

40|$|A {{decision}} to offer breakfast to homeless people led to {{radical change in}} a church and its environment. Existing theories of change do not fully explain observations from our qualitative study; however, complexity theory constructs suggest how and why such change emerged. We offer four key findings. First, the radical change was unintended, emergent, and slow. Second, destabilizing conditions helped <b>small</b> <b>changes</b> to emerge and become radical. Third, subsequent actions amplified an initial <b>small</b> <b>change</b> and, though not intended to do so, promoted radical change. Finally, the dynamic interaction of amplifying actions, contextual conditions, and <b>small</b> <b>changes</b> led to continuous radical change...|$|R
