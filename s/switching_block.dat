Speeded face categorization was required on the basis of gender (G) or emotion (E) in single task blocks (GGG [...] . and EEE [...] .) or switching blocks (GGEEGGEE [...] .). General switch costs, the difference between <b>switching</b> <b>block</b> and single task block performance, decreased during development and then increased approximately linearly from age 18. In contrast, specific switch costs, the difference between switch trial and nonswitch trial performance in the <b>switching</b> <b>block,</b> were more stable across the same age range. These results demonstrate differential age effects in task-switching performance and provide a fine-grained analysis of switch costs from puberty to retirement. ...|$|E

The most important unknown parameters for simulations are burden weight and length of hanging rope. We will use robust control for crab and bridge control to ensure adaptivity for burden weight and rope length. Robust control will be designed for current control of the crab and bridge, necessary is to know the range of unknown parameters. Whole robust will be split to subintervals and after correct identification of unknown parameters the most suitable robust controllers will be chosen. The most important condition at the crab and bridge motion is avoiding from burden swinging in the final position. Crab and bridge drive is designed by asynchronous motor fed from frequency converter. We will use crane uplift with burden weight observer in combination for uplift, crab and bridge drive with cooperation of their parameters: burden weight, rope length and crab and bridge position. Controllers are designed by state control method. We will use preferably a disturbance observer which will identify burden weight as a disturbance.

40|$|The Hayling task is {{traditionally}} {{used to assess}} activation and inhibitory processes efficiency among various populations, such as elderly adults. However, the classical design of the task may also involve the influence of strategy use and efficiency of sentence processing in the possible differences between individuals. Therefore, {{the present study investigated}} activation and inhibitory processes in aging with two formats of an adapted Hayling task designed to reduce the involvement of these alternative factors. Thirty young adults (M = 20. 7 years) and 31 older adults (M = 69. 6 years) performed an adapted Hayling task including a <b>switching</b> <b>block</b> (i. e., unblocked design) in addition to the classical task (i. e., blocked design), and the selection of the response between two propositions. The results obtained with the classical blocked design showed age-related deficits in the suppression sections of the task but also in the initiation ones. These findings can be explained by a co-impairment of both inhibition and activation processes in aging. The results of the unblocked Hayling task, in which strategy use would be reduced, confirmed this age-related decline in both activation and inhibition processes. Moreover, significant correlations between the unblocked design and the Trail Making Test revealed that flexibility is equally involved in the completion of both sections of this design. Finally, the use of a forced-response choice offers a format that is easy to administer to people with normal or pathological aging. This seems particularly relevant for these populations in whom the production of an unrelated word often poses problems...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that bilingualism helps to offset age-related losses in certain executive processes such as inhibitory control, task switching and divided attention. The two studies presented in this dissertation investigated possible mechanisms underlying this bilingual advantage in executive control by examining the role of expectancies and goal maintenance in monolingual and bilingual younger (30 to 40 years) and older adults (60 to 80 years). In Chapter 2, the fadeout paradigm (Mayr & Liebscher, 2001) was used to examine differences in the ability to disengage from an irrelevant task cue. Testing began with single task blocks of shape and colour classifications presented separately, followed by a task <b>switching</b> <b>block</b> in which the two tasks alternated randomly. On trial 49, one of the tasks became irrelevant, leaving only a single task to perform. The critical variable was the point at which participants performance reflected this change by examining the number of trials required to return to single task block speed. Results showed that both younger and older bilinguals returned to single task block speeds sooner than monolinguals. The results were interpreted as showing that bilinguals were better able to use task cues to improve task performance and that outsourcing control to task cues may be beneficial. In Chapter 3, a dual modality classification paradigm was used to determine the speed at which two tasks could be executed {{at the same time as}} a means of measuring the ability to sustain task goals. The task required participants to simultaneously respond manually to visual stimuli and verbally to auditory stimuli. Results revealed that younger and older bilinguals showed smaller costs in responding to two tasks whereas monolinguals experienced larger delays in making their responses. Proportion analysis of dual task costs and pairs of responses revealed a bilingual advantage and did not show any age-related increases in costs. The results were interpreted as demonstrating the strength in goal maintenance in bilinguals, allowing them to establish a task goal, control interference from stimulus pairings in order to uphold the goal, and to manage multiple streams of information, and these abilities are sustained in aging...|$|E
40|$|ATM {{is based}} on the efforts of the ITU-T Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN) standard. It was {{originally}} conceived as a high-speed transfer technology for voice, video, and data over public networks. The ATM Forum has broadened the ITU-T's vision of ATM for extended use over public and private networks, multi-protocol support and mobile ATM. There are also some ATM applications in High Performance Computing (HPC). ATM is a packet switching technique based on a virtual circuit mechanism. Data flows are statistically multiplexed and communication resources are dynamically shared. Therefore the high performance ATM switch is essential for quality of services (QoS). This thesis introduces typical ATM switch architecture design and analyses design problems. The research objective is to propose a switch architecture design that can solve or improve those existing problems to achieve a superior performance. The research goal is an integrated ATM switch architecture that will handle both unicast and multicast packets. Unlike the usual design for the multicast ATM switch which concentrates on a cell copy network with a unicast switching network, the proposed switch architecture processes the network packets in a single <b>switching</b> <b>block,</b> and allows unicast and multicast packets to co-exist without competing. The switch design has a simple topology and operation principle and is easy to implement. Furthermore, no copy network is required. Three major components are proposed to form the core of the new switch architecture: the parallel buffering strategy for improved buffer performance, the fast table lookup algorithm for packet duplication and routing, and the relay ring controller for solving the contention problem associated with multiple packets destined for the same output port. A mathematical model is presented and its numerical results are analysed. In addition, the simulation algorithms for the proposed switching design are presented and compared against the switching design with input and output buffering strategies. The simulation results are also compared and analysed against the numerical results. A multicast traffic model is also presented. Its performance calculation for the proposed switch is achieved through simulation. Performance analysis is compared against the output buffering switch under the same multicast traffic model. The performance analysis shows that the proposed switch architecture achieves high throughput with low cell loss rate and low time delay. Its performance can be as good as the output buffering strategy or better. Therefore the proposed switch design has solved the problems associated with input and output buffering. This thesis also analyses the complexity of the proposed switch architecture and suggests a topology to build a large scale ATM switch. The suitability and feasibility for production implementation are also addressed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper explores {{theories}} on designing optimal multipoint interconnection structures, and proposes a simple switch box design scheme {{which can be}} directly applied to field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), switch box designs, and communication switching network designs. We present a new hyperuniversal switch box designs with four sides and terminals on each side, which is routable for every multipin net-routing requirement. This new design is proved to be optimum for a I FFF S and close to optimum for T with T &quot;Q switches. We also give a formal analysis and extensive benchmark experiments on routability comparisons between today’s most well-known FPGA switch boxes like disjoint <b>switch</b> <b>blocks</b> (Xilinx XC 4000 Type), Wilton’s <b>switch</b> <b>blocks,</b> Universal <b>switch</b> <b>blocks,</b> and our Hyperuniversal switch boxes. We apply the design scheme to rearrangeable switching network designs targeting for applications of connecting multiple terminals (e. g., teleconferencing). Simply using a-sided hyperuniversal <b>switch</b> <b>block</b> with a crossbar attached to each side, one can build a three-stage one-sided polygonal switching network capable of realizing every multipoint connection requirement on terminals. Besides, due to the fine-grained decomposition property of our design scheme, the new switch box designs are highly scalable and simple on physical layout and routing algorithm implementations.

This ability can be realized using programmable logic cores. These cores are blocks of programmable logic that can be embedded into a fixed-function ASIC or a custom chip. Such cores differ from stand-alone FPGAs in that they can take on a variety of shapes and sizes. With this in mind, we investigate the detailed routing characteristics of rectangular programmable logic cores.
