500|$|In January 2012, the FIA {{banned the}} use of [...] "reactive ride-height". The system, first {{proposed}} by Lotus in 2010 (but not applied until 2012), used hydraulic cylinders located in the brake calipers and suspension push-rods to make minute adjustments to the ride height of the car, thereby keeping the ride height at an optimal level throughout the race and providing stability during braking. The FIA initially approved the device as being legal, and several teams, including Ferrari and Williams, submitted plans to the FIA for their own versions of the device before it was banned one week later. The FIA later confirmed that the reactive ride-height systems violated Article 3.15 of the technical regulations, which states that [...] "any aerodynamic effect created by the suspension should be incidental to its primary function" [...] and [...] "any device that influences the car's aerodynamics must remain immobile {{in relation to the}} <b>sprung</b> <b>part</b> of the car" [...] and further noted that the system's primary purpose was achieving aerodynamic gains as opposed to providing stability under braking, and that {{the use of}} reactive ride-heights could also be challenged under Article 10.2 of the technical regulations, which govern suspension systems.|$|E
2500|$|The tuned {{mass damper}} system was used by several teams, notably Renault, during {{the latter part of}} 2005 and the 2006 seasons. The devices were located in the nosecone, and were {{particularly}} effective in corners and over kerbs to keep the tyres in closer contact to the track surface than they would otherwise be. After the French Grand Prix, the FIA announced that the system would be outlawed. This had a particularly significant effect on Renault, as the team had effectively built their cars around the devices, and had introduced them as long ago as the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix. At the German Grand Prix the Renault team submitted one of their cars for scrutineering by the race stewards, who ruled that the devices were acceptable. The FIA launched an appeal against this decision, and on 23 August 2006 the FIA International Court of Appeal issued a statement upholding this appeal and rejecting the stewards' decision. The Court of Appeal stated that the system infringed part of the bodywork section (Article 3.15) of the Formula One Technical Regulations, which stated that any specific part of the car influencing its aerodynamic performance had to: comply with the rules relating to bodywork, be rigidly secured to the entirely <b>sprung</b> <b>part</b> of the car (rigidly secured means not having any degree of freedom), and remain immobile in relation to the <b>sprung</b> <b>part</b> of the car. The central argument was whether the mass dampers function as aerodynamic devices or {{as a part of the}} suspension system. The FIA reasoned that because the devices did not [...] "remain immobile in relation to the <b>sprung</b> <b>part</b> of the car", they were illegal. But the FIA failed to explain how the damper, which was entirely enclosed with the car can be counted as bodywork when article 1.4 of the regulations defined bodywork as: ...|$|E

5000|$|The unified rear {{triangle}} or [...] "URT" [...] for short, {{keeps the}} bottom bracket and rear axle directly connected at all times. Suspension action is provided between the rear triangle, which unites rear axle and bottom bracket, {{and the front}} triangle, which unites seat and front axle. This design uses only one pivot, which keeps the number of moving parts down. The fixed length between bottom bracket and rear axle gives the URT the advantage of zero chain growth and consistent front derailleur shifting. Additionally the bike is easily modified into a single-speed. However, as the URT's suspension moves, the distance between seat and pedals changes, detracting from pedaling efficiency. Furthermore, when the rider shifts any weight from the seat to the pedals, {{he or she is}} shifting weight from the <b>sprung</b> <b>part</b> of the bike to the unsprung parts. As such, part of the rider's weight is no longer suspended by the suspension system. Since pedaling itself is a shift of this weight, the design is very prone to suspension bob.|$|E

5000|$|The Lotus E20 {{was planned}} to feature a [...] "reactive ride height" [...] {{suspension}} system — a mechanical device designed to maintain ride height under braking — {{at the start}} of the 2012 season. Lotus (and formerly both their immediate predecessors, Lotus Renault GP and Renault F1 Team) had been developing the system since January 2010. The system used hydraulic cylinders located in the brake calipers and suspension push-rods to make minute adjustments to the ride height of the car, thereby keeping the ride height at an optimal level throughout the race and providing stability during braking. This initially had the approval of the FIA, who reversed their position one week later ruling that such systems were in breach of their regulations, on the grounds that the primary function of such a device was improve the aerodynamic performance of cars, and was therefore in violation of Article 3.15 of the technical regulations, which states that [...] "any device that influences the car's aerodynamics must remain immobile in relation to the <b>sprung</b> <b>part</b> of the car". The teams were notified of the FIA's decision on 20 January 2012, and as a consequence, the reactive ride height system did not feature on 2012 cars.|$|E
5000|$|On the Thursday {{before the}} Australian Grand Prix, the FIA's {{technical}} delegate Charlie Whiting declared {{the system to}} be legal. However, shortly before the final practice session on Saturday afternoon, representatives from Red Bull Racing and Lotus F1 approached the race stewards and requested that the FIA review the original verdict, claiming that the front wing system was in violation of Articles 3.15 and 3.18, which govern the use of DRS and driver-operated aerodynamic devices. On the Thursday before the Malaysian Grand Prix, the FIA rejected all claims that the system was illegal, allowing Mercedes to compete with an unaltered car. Three weeks later in China, Lotus F1 filed a formal protest against the system, citing Article 3.15 of the technical regulations — which states that [...] "any device that influences the car's aerodynamics must remain immobile {{in relation to the}} <b>sprung</b> <b>part</b> of the car" [...] — as the basis for their challenge. The stewards later unanimously rejected the protest. They stated that [...] "the sole purpose of the DRS as stated in article 3.18.3, is to improve overtaking. The Mercedes design is completely consistent with this objective" [...] and further clarified that [...] "the protest is dismissed {{on the grounds that the}} FIA confirmed the assertion of the Mercedes team that it had, in accordance with Article 2.4 and/or 2.5 of the F1 Technical Regulations, sought clarification from the FIA Formula One Technical Department concerning this matter and the FIA confirmed that the Mercedes design had been deemed permissible", before the start of the season. Lotus has since confirmed that they will not appeal against decision.|$|E

H 577 P EE 2014 Linxxiv, 191 leaves :illustrations (some color); 30 cmActive {{suspension}} system (ASS) {{has been growing}} its popularity in industrial development and academic research since 1980 s. The main advantage of electromagnetic ASS is its high performance in automotive applications. The ASS shows a high flexibility in control and provides enhanced comfort and safety to drivers and passengers when it is compared with the passive suspension. While compared to the pneumatic and hydraulic types, the ASS with electrical actuators can eliminate many mechanical components and perform faster response which in turn reduces the maintenance cost. Investigations into the electromagnetic ASS have been actively performed by worldwide researchers. Switched reluctance actuator (SRA) {{is a type of}} synchronous motors that has simple structure, low cost, robustness, and reliability characteristics. The linear motion type of SRA, linear switched reluctance actuator (LSRA), has inherent distinct advantages of high force and fault tolerance features, which align with the ASS operations to maintain equilibrium. The ASS with LSRA involves complex control. Variable reluctance and inherent nonlinear force characteristics are two major uncertainties that lead to implementation difficulty of LSRA control. Hence, an accurate position sensor is installed to the system for phase commutation and force control. A noise-free tracking mechanism is developed to acquire high precision position control. The ultimate objective of this project is to investigate and propose an effective nonlinear controller and position-tracking scheme for the quarter-car and full-car ASS equipped with LSRA. To achieve this target, the whole research work frame is divided into three phases. The first phase of research work is to investigate the linear actuator and develop the prototype of LSRA for the ASS. The magnetic path of the LSRA and its operation principle are reviewed. Based on the dimension and force requirement of the ASS, the specified magnetic circuit is modelled and analysed through finite element analysis (FEA). Moreover, the prototype model is developed and verified by experimental implementation through direct drive converter. Following the fabrication of the proposed LSRA, the experimental platform of the quarter-car ASS is built. The models of the quarter-car ASS and full-car ASS are developed for both force control of LSRA and nonlinear advanced control of ASS. The open-loop instability exists due to the external road disturbances which compensation algorithms are used to meet the standstill requirement; moreover, the coupling behaviour of the full-car ASS deteriorates the performance of the controller. To simplify the control scheme of the overall system, the ASS is divided into two subsystems, <b>sprung</b> <b>part</b> and unsprung part. The control issue focuses on the <b>sprung</b> <b>part</b> to improve the performance of the ASS. High accuracy position feedback is critical in this application. A novel tracking mechanism without the requirement of the system state equation, the so-called tracking differentiator (TD), is introduced to track the feedback displacement signal and to calculate its velocity directly through numerical method based on optimal control theory. The effectiveness of the TD is verified through position tracking of the sinusoidal road profile. A nonlinear proportional-derivative (PD) controller is developed for the quarter-car ASS. Both the simulation and experimental results illustrate that the electromagnetic active suspension control system can achieve a high motion performance and keep the system stable consistently with the proposed nonlinear PD controller. The developed nonlinear control method is more robust than that of linear PD controller under the variations of system parameters and road disturbances. The second phase of the research work is to improve the robustness of the whole {{suspension system}} by implementing the nonlinear controllers into the ASS. An integral sliding mode controller is examined. The integral item of integral sliding surface guarantees the stability of the nominal system at the initial time instant. In addition, adaptive mechanism is applied to the quarter-car ASS. An adaptive model following control method is used to determine the dynamic behaviour of the suspension system by predefining a reference model. The control input is generated through adaptive regulator based on partially known parameters and disturbances. Furthermore, combination of sliding mode technique and adaptation mechanism is attempted in this research to obtain the advantages of simplicity and robustness. The final phase of the research work is to propose both linear and nonlinear control algorithms for the full-car ASS. The full-car sprung mass subsystem is decoupled into three individual single-input single-output subsystems using decoupling transformation matrix. This results that the control complexity of the full-car active suspension is significantly simplified. The proposed control algorithms are categorised by two types of suspension models such that one is linear and the other is nonlinear. For the linear model, a Linear Model Following Control method is used to suppress the vertical vibration due to road profile. A proportional-derivative regulator is added to compensate the parameters variation and external disturbance. For the other one, a nonlinear sliding mode controller is applied. The discontinuous control laws of the sliding mode controller compensate the system uncertainties and unmodelled dynamics. The thesis presents a number of advanced control methods to successfully suppress the vertical oscillation of the ASS and it thus enhance the safety and comfort. It is confident that the new development will be applied to a vehicle {{for the next generation of}} mobility. Department of Electrical EngineeringPh.
