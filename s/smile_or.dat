Becky Randel of Billboard felt that emotion guided the mood for the evening and stated that [...] "Bey was overcome when the audience knew all the lyrics to her new song, [...] "Hold Up" [...] and she often stopped to <b>smile</b> <b>or</b> nod at her exuberant BeyHive. Writing for Rolling Stone, Kat Bein said Beyoncé was [...] "a prime example of entertainment and a vision of an artist at her apex" [...] and later commented [...] "the show was a visual feast as well as an emotional tour de force, packed with fireworks, confetti, rearranging stage designs and aerial dancers".|$|E

She talked to him regularly on the telephone, was depressed when he left the hospital, and jumped about exuberantly when she received a message from him. Dmitri Chakh-Bagov adored Olga and talked of killing Rasputin for her if she only gave the word, because it was the duty of an officer to protect the imperial family even against their will. However, he also reportedly showed other officers the letters Olga had written to him when he was drunk. Another young man, Volodia Volkomski, appeared to have affection for her as well. [...] "(He) always has a <b>smile</b> <b>or</b> two for her", wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on December 16, 1916.

500|$|In comparison, some reviewers {{were more}} {{critical}} of American Gangster. Jonathan Crocker of Time Out London was polarized with the film, criticizing its aesthetics. In his review, he wrote, [...] "Scott's meticulous aesthetics can’t touch the urban texture and deep focus of The French Connection, The Godfather, Serpico and Prince of the City – all looming heavily in intertextual nods." [...] In contrast, Crocker praised Washington's acting, writing, [...] "He's immense: centering every scene with tractor-beam charisma, that dangerous, easy charm hovering between a luxury <b>smile</b> <b>or</b> blazing violence." [...] In conclusion, Crocker gave the film three out of five stars. Similarly, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'C-' grade, expressing that American Gangster is [...] "never dull, {{but it could have}} used more good old-fashioned melodramatic intrigue." [...] Gleiberman found Washington's performance to have [...] "a ghastly ingenuity". Empires Ian Freer rated the film three stars out of five; he stated that it was [...] "undeniably enjoyable" [...] and praised the cast, but also noted that he felt that [...] "very little in the movie feels fresh, re-treading scenes, riffs and imagery from the whole history of crime flicks" [...] and that the film did not explore enough of Lucas' story and Scott's visual imagination. Slant Magazine journalist Nick Schager harshly criticized the film, giving the film a one out of four stars. Schager remarked that the film was [...] "dumb as a rock", and that it was [...] "far too convinced of its import to be any fun." [...] Giving American Gangster a two out of five stars, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was disappointed with Washington's acting, asserting, [...] "He doesn't seem to relax and enjoy himself in the role, or even inhabit it very satisfyingly." [...] He resumed: [...] "He never has the menace of his dirty cop in Training Day, and we don't see anything like the transformation from street-hustler to leader in Malcolm X. That shoulder-shimmying swagger is rarely seen, and the brand-classic robes of American Gangster sit on him heavily." ...|$|E

Barr said in 2010 [...] "I can see a situation where the federal government is going to bring an entire suitcase of San Francisco values to the American family, and while I would love to explain all the things that are wrong with that, the fact {{is that this is a}} corrupting, left-leaning, influence on a section of society that so many liberal elites want to see taken out of the 'red state' column.
