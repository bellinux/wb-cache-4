Few households had a <b>sanitary</b> <b>installation</b> or a domestic water supply. However, neither water-contact nor contaminative behavior were indiscriminate. The people made considerable effort to defaecate far from a water source, to obtain household drinking water from the cleanest source, and to bathe only at certain sites where privacy is assured.

The key influence on infection status was the relative location of the house and snail-free or snail colonized water sources.

40|$|Hydrodynamic {{processes}} largely {{determine the}} efficacy of drinking water treatment systems, in particular disinfection systems. A {{lack of understanding of}} the hydrodynamics has resulted in suboptimal designs of these systems. The formation of unwanted disinfection-by-products and the energy consumption or use of chemicals is therefore higher than necessary. In drinking water engineering, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is therefore increasingly applied to predict the performance of treatment installations and to optimise these installations. CFD uses advanced numerical models to predict flow, mixing and (bio) -chemical reactions. In this thesis, the hydrodynamics and (bio) -chemistry in ozone and UV systems are studied by means of CFD models combined with experimental techniques. This combination leads to further development of CFD modelling as a tool to evaluate the performance of drinking water treatment installations. If the CFD model is applied properly, accounting for the complex turbulent motions and validated by experiments, this tool leads to a better design of UV reactors, ozone systems and other systems dictated by hydrodynamics. This work resulted in new insights in the applicability of models in ozone and UV installations, and new insights in design aspects of these <b>installations.</b> <b>Sanitary</b> EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|In {{the article}} the short {{historical}} review {{on the design}} of sanitary rooms and their configurations is given. The main errors of the recent years, which led to the decrease in accommodation convenience because of the wrong approach from both the architect and engineers, are given. It is possible to use a small useful area for sanitary facilities, but it is connected with the lack of possibility of connecting washing and dishwashers. The author considers the options of engineering equipment placement in sanitary rooms taking into account the convenience of use, safety, and also resource-saving aspect. Various solutions on the organization of heating and ventilation are provided. The possible technical solutions allowing solving a flooding problem of the first floors in elite housing estates in case of accident are offered with the help of full waterproofing of sanitary rooms, and also the whole area of the apartment. The main attention was focused on the improvements of sanitary rooms for one-room and two-room apartments, which are the most demanded in the modern market of real estate. Layout solutions of the reduced bathrooms on the placement of the necessary equipment with choice justification are provided. The attention is paid to the layout solution for modern kitchens on order to increase their comfort by the use of special two-section sinks, and also a grinder of food waste in order to allow to lower the load of the systems of rubbish disposal of a building, by dumping the crushed garbage in an internal sewer network. Various options of evolutionary development of sanitary rooms for increasing the comfort degree are given. First of all, the development should happen in the direction of not only sanitation and hygiene, but also of the maintenance of the physical health of the people living in the building. It can be carried out by increase in a useful area of <b>sanitary</b> rooms, <b>installation</b> of exercise machines, medical bathtubs and a Jacuzzi, which allows receiving good relaxation after a difficult day.

The use {{of random}} co-polymer polypropylene (PP-R) {{in hot water}} sanitary systems has grown substantially in Europe {{over the last five}} years. It is expected that the numerous benefits of PP-r over other materials will help this trend continue, and expand beyond Europe. Ongoing work on standards and specifications promises to further strengthen PP-r pipes' competitiveness. Therefore, the performance of such a new product is worth investigation. Apart from the PP pipe industry, analyzing the overall performance of the whole sanitary pipe sector (Steel and PP pipe) is as important in order to understand major differences. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the development of a new entry in the Turkish industrial market at a Turkish company that operates as the six largest producer of longitudinally welded steel pipes in Europe. Throughout this study, the market development of PP-r pipes in Europe and in Turkey, together with the various success factors that have contributed to the substitution of traditional non-plastic pipe solutions with PP-R systems in <b>sanitary</b> tap water <b>installations</b> are also introduced.

Urban design concept is based on several ideas. I tried to involve the complex into the life and urban structure of this part of Brno and to create a possible new center. I also tried to recognize the values and qualities of the area as a whole and of its individual components. I created zones, characterized by different interactions with the neighborhood. By the entrance into the area I place an object called “gate”, which should draw the attention of passers-by. It clearly guides to enter the island and later the school building. The central part of the island is cleaned from the later extensions and a new foreground of entry to school is formed there. This zone, which continues to the north over the old mill-race between the neighboring buildings, is public, communicates, but is clearly defined and has its own inner life. Third, semi-private area is a residential waterfront of the mill-race with the existing balcony-access house and a new housing for students. The fourth area is a public park, detached from the school entrance courtyard by the block of trees and connected to the village by a new foot bridge. The architectural design of the spinning-mill conversion is based on the concept of inserting new objects into existing autonomous structure of the house.

However, this process of consolidation of housing in the final analysis has become in many ways, many of them by modifying (adapting) largely the original proposal for definitive housing proposed by the Government, non-compliance with the objectives to initiate them this new housing policy (incurring excessive economic costs from the user, as at the same time extending the process times).
