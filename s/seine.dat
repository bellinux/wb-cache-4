5|$|<b>Seine</b> had a rapid passage back to European waters, {{arriving}} in the Bay of Biscay on 28 June. Early the following morning, with the Brittany coast in sight, <b>Seine</b> was spotted by the inshore frigate squadron of HMS Jason, HMS Pique and HMS Mermaid. While Mermaid cut <b>Seine</b> off from the coast, Jason and Pique gave chase as <b>Seine</b> fled southwards. Pique reached <b>Seine</b> at 23:00 that evening and {{for more than two}} and a half hours the frigates pounded at one another until Pique fell back. Pique and Jason continued the chase full speed through the night, until suddenly all three frigates crashed headlong into the sandbanks off La Tranche-sur-Mer on the Vendée coast. Even while grounded the frigates continued to fire on one another until Mermaid finally arrived and the outnumbered <b>Seine</b> surrendered. Jason and <b>Seine</b> were badly damaged but successfully refloated, the casualties on the packed decks of the French ship appallingly high, but Pique was an irretrievable wreck: the ship was evacuated and then burnt before the remainder of the squadron returned to Britain with their prize.|$|E

5|$|By 23 August, the {{remainder}} of the Wehrmacht's Seventh Army had entrenched itself along the <b>Seine</b> River, in preparation for the defence of Paris. Simultaneously, elements of Army Group G—including the German 15th Army and the 5th Panzer Army—moved to engage American forces in the south. In the following week, elements of the Canadian 1st Army repeatedly attacked these German units on the <b>Seine</b> in attempts to break through to the Channel Ports. On the evening of 23 August, French and American Army units entered Paris.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the day {{the chase}} continued, the British frigates gaining slowly on their quarry and as {{darkness}} fell Pique closed with the larger French ship. At 23:00 Milne {{was close enough to}} open fire on <b>Seine,</b> to which Bigot responded without reducing speed. For the next {{two and a half hours}} the frigates exchanged broadsides at full speed as the French coastline rapidly approached ahead. At 01:35 a shot from <b>Seine</b> struck the main topmast on Pique, bringing it crashing down. The consequent loss of speed forced Milne back, <b>Seine</b> pulling away from the smaller ship but unable to escape Jason which was steadily gaining.|$|E

5|$|Between 1853 and 1870, the Emperor Napoleon III and the city's first {{director}} of parks and gardens, Jean-Charles Alphand, created the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes, Parc Montsouris and the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, {{located at the}} four points of the compass around the city, {{as well as many}} smaller parks, squares and gardens in the Paris's quarters. Since 1977, the city has created 166 new parks, most notably the Parc de la Villette (1987), Parc André Citroën (1992), and Parc de Bercy (1997). One of the newest parks, the Promenade des Berges de la <b>Seine</b> (2013), built on a former highway on the Left Bank of the <b>Seine</b> between the Pont de l'Alma and the Musée d'Orsay, has floating gardens and gives a view of the city's landmarks.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, the {{population}} of Paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delanoë became the first socialist mayor of Paris. In 2007, {{in an effort to}} reduce car traffic in the city, he introduced the Vélib', a system which rents bicycles for the use of local residents and visitors. Bertrand Delanoë also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the <b>Seine</b> into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la <b>Seine,</b> which he inaugurated in June 2013.|$|E

On 25 August, the U.S. 2nd Armored Division fought its way into Elbeuf, making contact with British and Canadian armoured divisions. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division advanced into the Forêt de la Londe on the morning of 27 August. The area was strongly held; the 4th and 6th Canadian brigades suffered many casualties over the course of three days as the Germans fought a delaying action in terrain well suited to defence. The Germans pulled back on 29 August, withdrawing over the <b>Seine</b> the next day. On the afternoon of 30 August, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division crossed the <b>Seine</b> near Elbeuf and entered Rouen to a jubilant welcome.|$|E

5|$|The Americans, {{assigned}} {{to land at}} Utah and Omaha, were {{to cut off the}} Cotentin Peninsula and capture the port facilities at Cherbourg. The British at Sword and Gold, and the Canadians at Juno, were to capture Caen and form a front line from Caumont-l'Éventé to the south-east of Caen to protect the American flank, while establishing airfields near Caen. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would provide a suitable staging area for a push south to capture the town of Falaise. A secure lodgement would be established and an attempt made to hold all territory north of the Avranches-Falaise line during the first three weeks. The Allied armies would then swing left to advance towards the River <b>Seine.</b> Montgomery envisaged a ninety-day battle, ending when all the forces reached the <b>Seine.</b>|$|E
