5|$|Wood and her {{brothers}} were {{actively involved in}} Theatre in the Park while growing up, including an appearance by her in the 1987 production of her father's musical comedy adaptation of A Christmas Carol when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few months old. Subsequently, she played the Ghost of Christmas Past in several productions at the theater, and she later starred as Helen Keller alongside her mother (who played Anne Sullivan) in a production of The Miracle Worker, under her father's direction.

500|$|Richard was the second-oldest of ten {{children}} born to Joseph Elvin and Mary Alice Richard. Adults and children who knew her considered her to be smart but otherwise unremarkable. She was a devout Catholic but no more so than was customary in the local Cajun community. Richard's mother said, [...] "She liked sports and was always busy with something. She went to church and said her rosary, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> normal little girl." [...] In May 1959, after reading a book about Therese of Lisieux Richard asked her grandmother whether she, too, could become a saint by praying like Therese.|$|E
500|$|Chaiken also didn't want {{to portray}} Jenny's ordeal in an {{explicit}} manner, confirming this she said: [...] "I am loath to portray rape as a filmmaker. I {{think it is}} really hard {{to do it without}} somehow becoming complicit and exploitative. And so as much as it's important to talk about it, I wanted to be vague and not milk it." [...] Chaiken has also admitted that the use of dream sequences involving Jenny were not a successful inclusion, but claimed it was necessary to portray Jenny coming to terms with her abuse. Heather Hogan of AfterEllen criticized the storyline because there was no conclusion to it, also stating it was never explored enough, leading everyone to think <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> jerk.|$|E

500|$|Further success came to Adams {{when she}} reteamed with David O. Russell {{in the crime}} film American Hustle, co-starring Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, and Jennifer Lawrence. Inspired by the 1970s Abscam scandal, the film {{featured}} Adams in the rare glamorous part of a seductive con artist, though she played it so that [...] "everything felt justified and it didn't feel like <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> sexy sociopath". She collaborated closely with Bale to build their characters and made off-screen suggestions to Russell, including for {{a scene in which}} she is aggressively kissed on the lips by her lover's wife (played by Lawrence). The experience was grueling for Adams, who later admitted that Russell had been too hard on her and had made her cry frequently; she said that she regretted bringing such a negative experience home to her daughter. American Hustle was acclaimed by critics; Manohla Dargis of The New York Times believed that Adams [...] "goes deeper here than she's ever been allowed to" [...] and wrote that she had successfully [...] "turn an unpredictable character into a thrillingly wild one". She won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical and received her fifth Oscar nomination (her first for Best Actress). Her and American Hustle were deemed by critics to be among the best films of 2013, and they were both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Zap2it wrote, [...] "Sure, Blair's (Leighton Meester) {{been dreaming}} of her fairytale wedding since <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> little girl. But it's {{also true that}} producers of Gossip Girl have been dreaming of this moment {{for a long time}} as well. And the Upper East Side drama didn't disappoint. In fact, it was easy the best episode this season." [...] Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic gave the episode a four stars rating out of five writing, [...] "In {{what has come to be}} sort of a make-or-break episode, Gossip Girl had a golden opportunity to redeem its recent mediocrity and prove itself worthy of all the passion and loyalty we've invested over the years. While there were some gaping plot holes and disappointments tonight - especially depending on your couple of choice - you can't find fault with the pure number of twists, especially during the last five minutes." [...] Marsi appreciated the references to Gossip Girls early days, [...] "The promised homages to the old days were there in spades, and incorporated in ways that actually fit the present-day story. Case in point: A memorable Gossip Girl quote ("I love you, always have, always will") which was spoken to a very different character long ago. Also, the cover of [...] "Young Folks" [...] at the onset was fun." [...] The Huffington Posts Laura Prudom also found the episode had honored Gossip Girls past, [...] "For the first time in recent memory, this week's milestone episode of Gossip Girl finally recaptured the confident plotting and razor sharp shocks of its first two seasons." [...] She also praised the fact Georgina is Gossip Girl which was totally unexpected. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "In classic Gossip Girl fashion, the 100th episode was full of witty one-liners, many of them from the mouth of Georgina Sparks and one in honor of The Princess Bride; paid homage to the pilot; and featured several head-turning moments." [...] Ology gave the episode a 9/10 grade.|$|E

2500|$|In early reviews, both Slate Dana Stevens and the Los Angeles Times Carina Chocano wrote {{articles}} {{claiming the}} film propagated sexist attitudes, a topic {{which was the}} primary focus of a Slate magazine podcast in which New York editor Emily Nussbaum said: [...] "Alison [...] made basically zero sense. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> completely inconsistent character.... she was this pleasant, blandly hot, peculiarly tolerant, yet oddly blank nice girl.

[...] Syd Stirling, the MP for Nhulunbuy in Northern Territory, also paid tribute to Marika saying, [...] "She really was a bridge between the two cultures out here. Dr Marika endeared herself to all of us as a mentor, reconciliation advocate, a passionate and gifted educator, academic, interpreter, translator and a wonderful mother." [...] Jenny Macklin, who is Australia's Minister for Indigenous Affairs, also called Marika the [...] "embodiment of reconciliation." ...|$|E

In the 6 months since the {{previous}} list, she had gained a remarkable 190 rating points. Judit's quiet and modest demeanour at the board contrasted with the intensity of her playing style. David Norwood, British GM, in recalling Judit beating him when he was an established player and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> child, described her as [...] "this cute little auburn-haired monster who crushed you". British journalist Dominic Lawson wrote about 12-year-old Judit's [...] "killer" [...] eyes and how she would stare at her opponent: [...] "The irises are so grey so dark they are almost indistinguishable from the pupils.
