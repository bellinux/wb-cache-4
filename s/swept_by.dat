40|$|We study {{structures}} of embedded projective manifolds <b>swept</b> out <b>by</b> cubic varieties. We show if an embedded projective manifold is <b>swept</b> out <b>by</b> high-dimensional smooth cubic hypersurfaces, then it admits an extremal contraction {{which is a}} linear projective bundle or a cubic fibration. As an application, we give a characterization of smooth cubic hypersurfaces. We also classify embedded projective manifolds of dimension at most five <b>swept</b> out <b>by</b> copies of the Segre threefold P^ 1 ^ 2. In {{the course of the}} proof, we classify projective manifolds of dimension five <b>swept</b> out <b>by</b> planes.

The following season, the Raptors redeemed themselves, defeating the Knicks in the first round 3–2; this effectively ended the Knicks' run as perennial NBA championship contenders, which began in the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} last in 1966–67, the Bruins {{qualified for}} the 1968 playoffs, their first appearance in the playoffs since the 1958–59 season. In the pre-season, the Bruins added Phil Esposito, Fred Stanfield and Ken Hodge from the Chicago Black Hawks {{in one of the}} most famous deals ever. The Bruins also added rookies Glen Sather and Derek Sanderson, developing a more aggressive image that led to the nickname of the 'Big Bad Bruins.' The Bruins, happy to make the playoffs, were <b>swept</b> <b>by</b> eventual champion Montreal in the first round.|$|E
5|$|During the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones {{and center}} Elden Campbell were {{traded to the}} Charlotte Hornets. The team also {{acquired}} J. R. Reid, B. J.

The team finished 31–19 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference. The Lakers defeated Houston {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, but were <b>swept</b> <b>by</b> San Antonio in the next round.

5|$|During the offseason, the Rockets {{went for}} a change of visual identity, making navy blue and silver the new primary colors while {{adopting}} a new cartoon-inspired logo and pinstriped jerseys. The Rockets won 48 games in the 1995–96 campaign, in which Olajuwon became the NBA's all-time leader in blocked shots. They beat the Lakers {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, but were <b>swept</b> <b>by</b> the eventual Western Conference Champions Seattle SuperSonics in the second round.|$|E
5|$|In the 1997–98 season, O'Neal and the Lakers had {{the best}} start in {{franchise}} history, 11–0. O'Neal would miss 20 games on the season due to an abdominal injury. Los Angeles battled Seattle for the Pacific Division title most of the season. In the final two months, the Lakers won 22 of their final 25 games, finishing 61–21, but still finished second to Seattle in the standings. The Lakers defeated Portland three games to one in the first roundto advance to face Seattle. Although the Sonics won the first game, the Lakers responded with four straight wins, taking the series, but were <b>swept</b> <b>by</b> the Jazz in the Western Conference Finals.|$|E

5|$|Jordan had {{completely}} recovered {{in time for}} the 1986–87 season, and he had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history. He joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only two players to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league high 37.1 points on 48.2% shooting. In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season. Despite Jordan's success, Magic Johnson won the league's Most Valuable Player Award. The Bulls reached 40 wins, and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year.

Midway through the season, Kesler was named to the PlanetUSA All-Star team for the 2005 AHL All-Star Game where he helped PlanetUSA defeat Team Canada for the first time in five years. Kesler finished third in team scoring with thirty goals and 57 points to be named the Moose's Most Valuable Player.
