50|$|The Tri-Ergon {{system used}} a special form of {{microphone}} without mechanical moving parts (Katodophone) for <b>sound</b> <b>pickup</b> {{and a special}} electric discharge tube for variable density film recording. For reproduction of sound, the system used an electrostatic loudspeaker.|$|E
50|$|Another ambient {{technique}} is the IRT (Institut für Rundfunktechnik) cross. Here, four cardioid microphones, 90 degrees relative to one another, {{are placed in}} square formation, separated by 21-25 cm. The front two microphones should be positioned 45 degrees off axis from the sound source. This technique therefore resembles back to back near-coincident stereo pairs. The microphones outputs are fed to the L, R and LS, RS channels. The disadvantage {{of this approach is}} that direct <b>sound</b> <b>pickup</b> is quite significant.|$|E
50|$|Specialized {{microphone}} arrays {{have been}} developed for recording purely the ambience of a space. These arrays are used in combination with suitable front arrays, or can be added to above mentioned surround techniques. The Hamasaki square (also proposed by NHK) is a well established microphone array used for the pickup of hall ambience. Four figure-eight microphones are arranged in a square, ideally placed far away and high up in the hall. Spacing between the microphones should be between 1-3 meters. The microphones nulls (zero pickup point) are set to face the main sound source with positive polarities outward facing, therefore very effectively minimizing the direct <b>sound</b> <b>pickup</b> as well as echoes {{from the back of the}} hall The back two microphones are mixed to the surround channels, with the front two channels being mixed in combination with the front array into L and R.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{location}} of the sound source is an important technique for equipment failures diagnostic application. This paper design a specific fault sound location system for capturing the specific sound source and determine its orientation. The two functions of sound recognition and location system are combined. The frequency domain characteristics based on similarity calculation method is used to identify the sound signal. The source localization algorithm based on the time delay estimation {{is used to calculate}} the time difference of arrival sound signal. By method of combining hardware circuit preprocessing and software design, the orientation of positioning of sound source is determined by the known <b>sound</b> <b>pickup</b> arrays spatial position. The sound location system uses two piece of MCU to achieve its function with simplification efficient algorithm and high accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Beamforming {{may be used}} {{to improve}} {{signal-to-noise}} ratio, reduce reverberation, cancel interference, or estimate source location. It is done with an array of sensors using a model of the arriving wavefront. Conventionally, a plane wave or point source model is used and this can cause decreased array gain or even total breakdown of beamforming when the source is directional. The directivity of some real world acoustic sources is reviewed in this work. Examples are shown where using a point source model leads to large performance penalties, such as when the array subtends a significant angle about the source. The performance penalty of using a point source model to beamform on the human talker is estimated using phase information available in the literature. An extension of beamforming applicable to directional sources with unknown directivity is presented. In the thesis, the proposed method is mostly intended for <b>sound</b> <b>pickup</b> of audio sources. The proposed beamforming method defines a set of "sub-beamformers", each designed to respond to a different spatial mode of the source. The outputs of the individual sub-beamformers are combined in a weighted sum to give an overall output of better quality than that of a conventional (point source) beamformer. It is shown that with appropriate weighting, the optimum array gain can be achieved In the case that the source happens to be a point source, the method reduces to conventional beamforming. Methods are demonstrated to estimate the weighted sum, based on the observed data. Simulation and experimentally measured results for a simple directional source and an array of 16 microphones show that the proposed beamforming method provides an array gain of about 11 dB while conventional beamforming, with a value of - 4 dB, does not provide any useful gain. Simulation results for simple sources in the presence of diffuse noise, diffuse noise and reverberation, or diffuse noise and an interferer are also presented. The computational complexity of the proposed beamforming method is also compared to that of conventional beamforming...|$|E

50|$|The {{types and}} models of pickups used can greatly affect {{the tone of}} the guitar. Typically, humbuckers, which are two magnet-coil {{assemblies}} attached to each other are traditionally associated with a heavier <b>sound.</b> Single-coil <b>pickups,</b> one magnet wrapped in copper wire, are used by guitarists seeking a brighter, twangier sound with greater dynamic range.|$|R

50|$|A single {{harmonic}} overtone is far {{quieter than}} a normal note with its many overtones. Amplification and related {{techniques such as}} distortion or compression are often used to improve the overall sound. Thicker strings, stronger pickups, and adjustment to amplifier settings (increasing gain) are some ways of doing this. Note that as {{only one of the}} fundamental sounds, it has a different volume through different pickups, depending on the proximity of nodes or antinodes to the pickup. The different volumes of overtones are the reason <b>pickups</b> <b>sound</b> different. The outcome of this is that if a node is directly over a <b>pickup,</b> it won't <b>sound</b> through that <b>pickup.</b>|$|R

40|$|Touching, diverting, restricting, or obstructing water jets {{constitutes}} {{a new type}} of user-interface for immersive multimedia environments such as totally acoustic, totally electronic, or hybrid musical instruments. The result is a richly expressive input device. In the context of a musical instrument, this device is called a hydraulophone. Developments in the rich expressivity of the hydraulophone are presented, as {{a new type of}} embouchure control. This paper presents a new concept called “finger-jet embouchure” in which each “key ” (water jet) on the instrument is governed by fluid-dynamics, rather than by solid key motion. The direct coupling between a musician’s finger and physical sound production in the liquid (which can be detected by underwater microphones and fed into a computer, thus creating a hyperacoustic user-interface) leads to highly expressive performance styles. By designing each note to be associated with one water-jet “mouth ” on the instrument, we give the performer an ability to fluidly interleave the dynamics of many notes simultaneously, producing a phenomenon named “polyphonic embouchure”. The result is the ability to perform richly expressive music, whether on an acoustic hydraulophone, or on an enhanced hydraulophone with <b>sound</b> <b>pickups</b> for hyperacoustic computer performances. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Electric guitars {{usually have}} {{one to four}} {{magnetic}} pickups. Identical pickups produce different tones depending on how near they are to the neck or bridge. Bridge pickups produce a bright or trebly timbre, and neck pickups are warmer or more bassy. The type of pickup also affects tone. Dual-coil <b>pickups</b> <b>sound</b> warm, thick, perhaps even muddy; single-coil <b>pickups</b> <b>sound</b> clear, bright, perhaps even biting. Guitars don't require a uniform pickup type: a common mixture is the [...] "fat Strat" [...] arrangement of one dual-coil at the bridge position and single coils {{in the middle and}} neck positions, known as HSS (humbucker/single/single). Some guitars have piezoelectric pickup in addition to electromagnetic pickups. Piezo pickups produce a more acoustic sound. The piezo runs through a built-in equalizer (EQ) to improve similitude and control tone. A blend knob controls the mix between electromagnetic and piezoelectric sounds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sound</b> {{that this}} <b>pickup</b> {{produced}} was clear—thanks {{to the narrow}} string-sensing blade—and powerful because of the relatively high resistance of the coil.

5000|$|In 1878 Hughes {{published}} {{his work on}} the effects of sound on the powered electronic <b>sound</b> <b>pickups,</b> called [...] "transmitters", being developed for telephones. He showed that the change in resistance in carbon telephone transmitters was a result of the interaction between carbon parts instead of the commonly held theory that it was from the compression of the carbon itself. Based on its ability to pick up extremely weak sounds, Hughes referred to it as a [...] "microphone effect" [...] (using a word coined by Charles Wheatstone in 1827 for a mechanical sound amplifier). He conducted a simple demonstration of this principle of loose contact by laying an iron nail across two other nails connected to a battery and galvanometer. His paper was read before the Royal Society of London by Thomas Henry Huxley on May 8, 1878 and his new [...] "microphone" [...] was covered in the July 1 edition of Telegraph Journal and Electrical Review. Hughes {{published his}} work during the time that Thomas Edison was working on a carbon telephone transmitter and Emile Berliner was working on a loose-contact transmitter. Both Hughes and Edison may have based their work on Philipp Reis' telephone work. Hughes would refine his microphone design using a series of [...] "carbon pencils" [...] stuck into blocks of carbon to better pick up sound but never patented his work, thinking it should be publicly available for development by others.|$|R
50|$|The Burns Tri-Sonic is a single-coil {{electric}} guitar pickup, with ceramic magnets and a chrome cover. The {{advantage of the}} Tri-Sonic pickup is that it produces a richer harmonic <b>sound</b> than <b>pickups</b> would in the traditional manner. Tri-Sonics are wider than the more popular single-coiled pickups, such as used by Fender. Many guitarists have guitar pickups replaced with Tri-sonics to change {{the sound of the}} guitar. When replacing traditional single-coils with Tri-Sonics more involved amendments to the guitar may be required, such as routing the body or altering the mounting mechanism. The Mini TRi-Sonic requires no amendments, routing or additional wiring and will fit directly into Fender style Pick-guards.|$|R
5000|$|Thin-bodied semi-acoustic guitars, {{such as the}} Epiphone Casino.

5000|$|EUB {{players who}} use the bow {{need to use the}} {{appropriate}} pickup, microphone, and preamplifier/equalizer combination to avoid the tendency for the amplified tone to be scratchy and high-sounding. To obtain a more natural arco sound, some performers use a condenser microphone for arco passages. Most bass pickups are designed to capture the pizzicato sounds of a double bass rather than the arco <b>sounds.</b> Some <b>pickup</b> manufacturers produce piezoelectric pickups that purportedly provide a natural reproduction of arco sound. Preamplifiers and equalizers for acoustic instruments or double basses {{can also be used to}} [...] "roll off" [...] the treble frequencies or [...] "notch out" [...] the [...] "scratchy-sounding" [...] frequencies.

5000|$|Where {{there is}} more than one pickup, a pickup {{selector}} switch is usually present. These typically select or combine the outputs of two or more pickups, so that two-pickup guitars have three-way switches, and three-pickup guitars have five-way switches (a Gibson Les Paul three-pickup Black Beauty has a three-position toggle switch which configures bridge, bridge and middle in middle position and neck pickups). Further circuitry sometimes combines pickups in different ways. For instance, phase switching places one pickup out of phase with the other(s), leading to a [...] "honky", [...] "nasal", or [...] "funky" [...] <b>sound.</b> Individual <b>pickups</b> can also have their timbre altered by switches, typically coil tap switches that effectively short-circuit some of a dual-coil pickup's windings to produce a tone similar to a single-coil pickup (usually done with push-pull volume knobs).|$|R
