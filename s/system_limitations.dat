Due to the operating system limit of the EDIT window class, the Notepad version shipped with Windows 3.0, Windows 3.1 and Windows 3.11 could not open files larger than 54 KB (kilobytes) and Microsoft recommended not to open files larger than 45 KB, with the official workaround advice provided by Microsoft being [...] "Use another text editor", but this limit was extended to 64 KB in Windows 95 (and remained the same in Windows 98 and Windows Me). On the Notepad version shipped with Windows XP the limit was 32 MB (megabytes) with the application displaying the message [...] "The file is too large for Notepad. Use another editor to edit the file" [...] if the user attempted to open a file larger than 32 MB. Newer {{versions of}} Notepad can open files at least up to 58 MB (megabytes) in size, and on Windows 8.1 the Notepad application is able to open files at least as large as 512 MB (megabytes) but fails to open 1 GB (gigabyte) files displaying the same message that Windows XP users would see ("The file is too large for Notepad. Use another editor to edit the file"). [...] However, on all 32-bit versions of Windows, there is a 2 GB (gigabytes) limit imposed on the maximum memory of all single-process 32-bit programs and thus on 32-bit machines no single-process text editor such as Notepad can open files larger than 2 gigabytes.|$|E

40|$|This study {{introduces}} {{a framework for}} re-design of manufacturing systems into practical optimum just-in-time systems by integration of computer simulation and analysis of variance. The conventional JIT approach is mostly applicable to static production systems and the dynamic production systems require a more practical integrated JIT approach.

This means, a unique practical optimum just-in-time system that considers <b>system’s</b> <b>limitations</b> and its dynamic behavior must be designed. To achieve the objective of this study, first, the actual system must be totally modeled and simulated. Second, the integrated simulation model is tested and validated by analysis of variance.
