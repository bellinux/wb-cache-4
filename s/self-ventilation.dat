40|$|This bachelorÂ´s thesis {{contains}} {{a summary of}} ventilation strategies used for ventilation of block of flats. In the beginning, it includes the list of most common harmful substances which might occur in this space. Next chapters present principles and purpose of ventilation, types of ventilation, characteristics. The principles of <b>self-ventilation</b> and forced air ventilation are described here, the ventilation systems based on these principles and {{advantages and disadvantages of}} these systems are mentioned. Also the minimum requirements of ventilation for living space are specified...|$|E
40|$|The {{torque density}} of {{electric}} motors strongly {{depends on the}} performance of the cooling system. In the axial flux yokeless and segmented armature machine, cooling inherently occurs through <b>self-ventilation</b> by both rotor discs. Nevertheless, an independent cooling system remains necessary for most applications. In the axial flux yokeless and segmented armature machine, the individual stator cores with concentrated windings are potted in the stator housing using an epoxy resin. These epoxy resins are relatively bad thermally conductive, and therefore, limit the heat transfer {{to the surface of the}} machine. Therefore, radially inward heat extraction fins are introduced in this paper. These fins provide an excellent thermal conduction path from the windings to the stator surface, where they can be abducted by conventional cooling techniques such as forced air or water jacket cooling. The focus of this paper is on the study of the radially inward heat extraction fins using thermal finite element modelling as well as experimental validation on a 4 kW axial flux yokeless and segmented armature machine stator. At steady state and for the rated losses, the temperature difference between the winding and stator housing is less than 10 degrees Celcius...|$|E
