40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to address the problem of energy {{recovery}} in the electric arc furnace process of steel industry by introducing a recently patented device in order to increase technical–economic performance. During a Tap‐To‐Tap cycle, a significant part of the energy required for steel production is dissipated by off‐gas. The high variability of temperatures and flows, and the high concentration of dust which characterize the production process, make common energy recovery practices hardly affordable, both from technological and economical perspective.

First, a proportional increase of accrual management relative to hedging for earnings smoothing reduces firm value. Second, the relative use of discretionary accruals to hedging declines with the percentage of outside directors, audit committee meeting frequency, and the percentage of outsiders sitting on the audit committee. These results suggest that boards and audit committees structured to be more independent of the management, and audit committees with more frequent meetings are more effective in monitoring the choice of the earnings <b>smoothing</b> <b>devices.</b> Third, the intensity of discretionary accruals is negatively related to firm value, consistent with the premise that managers use accounting methods opportunistically to maximize their utility {{at the expense of other}} contracting parties.

30|$|There may be {{good reasons}} to adjust {{parameters}} of unemployment insurance systems in response to cyclical fluctuations. In particular, countries with relatively short maximum durations in their UI benefit programs should probably extend them during recessions, both to ensure their ability to play the intended roles as automatic stabilizers and as consumption <b>smoothing</b> <b>devices,</b> and (possibly) {{to take advantage of}} pro-cyclical disincentive effects of UI. Given that the activation strategy has been attributed a major role in containing moral hazard problems in UI systems, it is obviously necessary to step up the use of active labor market programs in times of recession. I have argued, though, that cyclical fluctuations should probably not be fully accommodated by changes in the activity level, implying that the fraction of unemployed job seekers who participate in activation should be (slightly) pro-cyclical, at least conditional on unemployment duration. There are at least four reasons for this: i) Programs tend to have larger positive effects in good times; ii) the group of unemployed job seekers is more negatively selected in good times (and persons with poor employment prospects tend to have more to gain from ALMP participation); iii) the moral hazard problems in UI are, at least according to some studies, larger in good times; and iv) there are significant administrative costs associated with scaling ALMPs up and down according to cyclical fluctuations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Combining the {{arguments}} developed in [2] and [7], we introduce a <b>smoothing</b> <b>device</b> to the sieve procedure [3] of D. A. Goldston, J. Pintz, and C. Y. Yıldırım (see [4] for its simplified version). Our assertions embodied in Lemmas 3 and 4 imply that an {{improvement of the}} prime number theorem of E. Bombieri, J. B. Friedlander and H. Iwaniec [1] should give rise infinitely often to bounded differences between primes. To this end, a rework of {{the main part of}} [7] is developed in Sections 2 – 3; thus the present article is essentially self-contained, except for the first section which is an excerpt from [4]. 1. Let N be a parameter increasing monotonically to infinity. There are four other basic parameters H, R, k, ℓ in our discussion; the last two are integers. We impose the following conditions to them: (1. 1) H ≪ log N ≪ log R ≤ log N, and (1. 2) 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k ≪ 1. All implicit constants in the sequel are possibly dependent on k, ℓ at most; and besides, the symbol c stands for a positive constant with the same dependency, whose value may differ at each occurrence. It suffices to have (1. 2), since our eventual aim is to look into the possibility to detect the bounded differences between primes with a certain modification of the GPY sieve. We surmise that such a modification might be obtained by introducing a <b>smoothing</b> <b>device.</b> The present article is, however, only to indicate that the GPY sieve admits indeed a smoothing; it is yet to be seen if this particular smoothing contributes to our eventual aim.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} optimal choice of {{exchange}} rate regimes between two large currency areas. It provides {{a positive and}} normative analysis of alternative monetary policy rules in a model with sticky prices, monopolistic competition, and frictions in the processes of capital accumulation and acquisition of external finance. The stabilization and welfare analysis provides a sound result on the desirability of monetary policy and exchange rate flexibility as business cycle <b>smoothing</b> <b>devices.</b> Given the presence of financial frictions the paper gives a richer explanation of the mechanism behind the stabilization properties of floating exchange rates and explains the difference in sign of the international transmission of shocks compared to the model without capital. In a two country model without capital the pattern of output is mainly determined by the pattern of consumption: any movement in the exchange rate under floating exchange rates causes movements {{in the price of}} the international traded bond and in consumption and consequently in output. In the model with capital and financial frictions output mimics the movements in investment: an active monetary authority reacting to exchange rate movements generates perverse movements in the interest rate, destabilizing investment and output. The paper also suggests how monetary policy can improve financial stability, stressing the importance of the interest rate smoothing in tuning movements in investment and output and in reducing the welfare cost of financial frictions mostly under fixed exchange rates.

A safe fabrication method was developed and optimised for making sharp Ã‚Â« 25 nm end radius), symmetric Au tips for use in light emission in ambient scanning tunnelling microscopy. The Au tips were produced using a 2 -step etching process in an electrolyte comprising a 20 % CaCh solution. High resolution in both topography and photon mapping. was achieved using these Au tips. Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), selectively excited in attenuated total reflection (ATR) with an incident annular laser beam, formed with a novel conic input optics set-up, enhances the optical transmission through a sub-wavelength aperture in a silver film. The use ofan ion beam milled, circular grating pattern on the output face ofthe silver film, concentric with the aperture, gave a further enhancement {{by a factor of}} 5 and a total enhancement by a factor up to 40 relative to the off-resonance transmission through an identical sub-wavelength aperture in a smooth metal film.

Several novel devices are demonstrated to improve {{the performance of the}} novel nanocrystal memories. A novel TiSi 2 nanocrystal memory was demonstrated. TiSi 2 nanocrystals were synthesized on SiO 2 by annealing Ti covered Si nanocrystals. Compared to the reference Si nanocrystal memory, both experiment and simulation results show that TiSi 2 nanocrystal memory exhibits larger memory window, faster writing and erasing, and longer retention lifetime {{as a result of the}} metallic property of the silicide nanocrystals. Due to thermally stable, CMOS compatible properties, TiSi 2 nanocrystals are highly promising for nonvolatile memory device application. Metal/high-k dielectric core-shell nanocrystal memory capacitors were proposed. This kind of MOS memory shows good performance in charge storage capacity, programming and erasing speed. A self-assembled di-block co-polymer is used to align the NCs to improve the scalability of the overall sample. An ordered Co/Al 2 O 3 core-shell nanocrystal (NC) nonvolatile memory device was also fabricated. Self-assembled di-block co-polymer process aligned the NCs with uniform size. Co/Al 2 O 3 core-shell NCs were formed using atomic layer deposition of Al 2 O 3 before and after the ordered Co NC formation. Compared to Co NC memory, Co/Al 2 O 3 core-shell NC memory shows improved retention performance without sacrificing writing and erasing speeds. Another new discrete NiSi nanocrystals (NCs) were synthesized by rapid thermal oxygen annealing (RTO) of very thin Si/Ni/Si films on SiO 2 tunneling layer. The RTO process resulted in smooth surface of the NC floating layer, in turn, uniform thickness of subsequent control oxide layer. Metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor memory was fabricated. Electrical properties of the memory device such as programming, erasing and retention were characterized and good performance was achieved, which is due to the reduction of the leakage paths in the <b>smooth</b> <b>device</b> structure.
