Here {{we present a}} systematic study of scaling MoS 2 devices and contacts with varying electrode metals and controlled deposition conditions, {{over a wide range}} of temperatures (80 to 500 K), carrier densities (10 ^ 12 to 10 ^ 13 1 /cm^ 2), and contact dimensions (20 to 500 nm). We uncover that Au deposited in ultra-high vacuum (~ 10 ^- 9 Torr) yields three times lower Rc than under normal conditions, reaching 740 Ohm-um and specific contact resistivity 3 x 10 ^- 7 Ohm. cm 2, stable for over four months. Modeling reveals separate Rc contributions from the Schottky barrier and the <b>series</b> <b>access</b> resistance, providing key insights on how to further improve scaling of MoS 2 contacts and transistor dimensions.

40|$|In {{this work}} we discuss {{limitations}} of the split-CV method when it is used for extracting carrier mobilities in devices with thin silicon channels like FinFETs, ultra thin body silicon-on-insulator (UTB-SOI) transistors and nanowire MOSFETs. We show that the high series resistance may cause frequency dispersion during the split-CV measurements, which leads to underestimating the inversion charge density and hence overestimating mobility. We demonstrate this effect by comparing UTB-SOI transistors with both recessed-gate UTB-SOI devices and thicker conventional SOI MOSFETs. In addition, the intrinsic high <b>series</b> <b>access</b> resistance in UTB-SOI MOSFETs can potentially lead to an overestimation of the effective internal source/drain voltage, which in turn results in a severe underestimation of the carrier mobility. A specific MOSFET test structure that includes additional 4 -point probe channel contacts is demonstrated to circumvent this problem, Finally, we accurately extract mobility in UTB-SOI transistors down to 0. 9 nm silicon film thickness (four atomic layers) by utilizing the 4 -point probe method and carefully choosing adequate frequencies for the split-CV measurements. It is found that in Such thin silicon film thicknesses quantum mechanical effects shift the threshold voltage and degrade mobility. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{correction}} {{methods for}} <b>series</b> <b>access</b> resistance {{errors in the}} dual whole-cell configuration did {{not take into account}} the effect of nonzero resting potentials (E(rest)) and junctional reversal potentials (E(rev)). Dual whole-cell currents were modeled according to resistor-circuit analysis and two correction formulas for the measurement of junctional currents (I(j)) were assessed. The equations for I(j), derived from Kirchoff's law before and after baseline subtraction of the nonjunctional current, were assessed for accuracy under a variety of whole-cell patch-clamp recording conditions. Both equations accurately correct for dual whole-cell voltage-clamp errors provided that the cellular parameters are included in the nonbaseline subtracted I(j) derivations. Junctional conductance (g(j)) estimates are most reliable at high junctional resistance (R(j)) values and minimize the need for corrective methods based on electrode series and cellular input resistances (R(el) and R(in)). In the "open-cell" configuration, low R(j) values relative to R(in) are required for accurate g(j) estimates. These methods provide the basis for accurate quantitative measurements of junctional resistance (or conductance) of gap junction channels or connexin hemichannels in the dual whole-cell or open-cell configurations. Revaluation of V(j) -dependent gating of rat connexin 40 g(j) produced nearly identical Boltzmann fits to previously published data. Continuous g(j) -V(j) curves generated by variable slope V(j) ramps provide for more accurate fits and assessment of the time-dependence of the half-inactivation voltage and net gating charge movement...|$|E

40|$|Research Aim and Questions: This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} a computer-based appointment system, which could integrate with the existing clinical information system and improve the patient access to the services offered by both General Practitioners (GPs) and Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) in a primary health care clinic Centre Health Complex (CHC). To achieve this requires {{the development of an}} understanding of the features and processes of patient booking in the primary health care environment; the identification of the gaps of the existing patient booking system; and a scheme of an improved system, which could fill these gaps. The output of this project is a prototype of patient appointment system built on web service technology. Research background: To acquire a routine appointment from a GP or an AHP, a patient may need to wait more than several weeks in CHC. Patient 2 ̆ 7 s long waiting time is always accompanied with some <b>series</b> <b>access</b> problems such as missed appointments in the practice. Consequently, some patients are driven from primary health care to Emergency Department (ED) and add pressure to the overburdened hospital system. The patient’s access problem is initiated by the traditional appointment system, which is based on a basic fixed schedule for booking patients. It does not record a patient request if the request is not met; therefore, it has missed the essential baseline data about the patient’s actual demands. Without this information, the practice could not plan effectively to fully meet the demands of the patients for primary care services. Research Methodology: This research followed a standard software development process – waterfall model. Three phases of study were carried out, including (1) requirement analysis, (2) system design, and (3) prototyping and unit testing. First, a filed study was conducted in the CHC to collect information about the features and processes of patient booking and the IT infrastructure in the clinic. The weakness of the practice workflow and the IT infrastructure were identified. Then the design of the new appointment system was proposed to plug these gaps. Finally, a prototype of the proposed appointment system was built. Result and Conclusion: This design and prototype appointment system was influenced by the general idea of the Advanced Access (AA) model. Its workflow was developed following the general process of AA: (1) setting up the access target; (2) monitoring the patient’s demand; and (3) planning the provider’s supply to meeting patient’s demand. The proposed appointment system was composed of four modules as: Request module, Schedule module, Performance module and Strategy module. The role of each module was to manage patients’ appointment requests, manage the providers’ supply, monitor practice performance and provide clinic recommendations for taking appointments respectively. In order to be compatible with the existing IT infrastructure, this appointment system was built on web services technology, so that both GPs and AHPs could benefit from the inventive management process and integrated interface. Future Direction of This Project: Due to the time limit, the implementation and evaluation were not conducted for this project. The prototype appointment will be implemented in CHC in the future, when the new features we have designed for this appointment system for improving patient access will be tested and justified...|$|E
