5|$|The song's {{accompanying}} music video, {{which takes}} place in a club surrounded by a cityscape, makes use of several visual effects including CGI animation and Unilux <b>strobes.</b> Ciara performed the song a number of times, including at the 2006 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and on the second season of So You Think You Can Dance.|$|E
5|$|In May 2013 The Light Group {{opened the}} Light nightclub in {{collaboration}} with Cirque du Soleil at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, costing $25 million. Light {{was the first time}} Cirque du Soleil worked as part of a nightclub. Among other features the club has a large wall of LED screens, and the room is illuminated with fog, lasers and <b>strobes.</b> DJs at the events include charting artists such as Kaskade and Tiesto, with prices ranging from $30 to $10,000 for certain table placements.|$|E
5|$|The rig {{consisted}} of a Front of House truss, two three-quarter angled trusses, and two straight mid-stage trusses. These were all located up-stage, and had two sub-hung trusses directly below them. There were two Lycian Starklite medium-throw truss spots, and an accumulation of specialty lights. The specialty lights included 54 two-light Molefays, six PAR 36 rotating beacons, 24 Martin Atomic 300 <b>Strobes,</b> 2 six-light Molefays, and 10 four-light Molefays. The rig also had LED units, which can be very bright, and which shone into the audience. Throughout the tour, 65 Philips Color Kinetics ColorBlast 12s, seven Color Blaze 48s, and twelve CK ColorBlaze 72s were used to light up {{the wall behind the}} band.|$|E
5000|$|After the <b>Strobe</b> Center 5000, Peterson Tuners re-designed their {{mechanical}} <b>strobe</b> tuning {{line and}} introduced {{a line of}} AutoStrobe series tuners. These selected the note automatically and offered programmability for advanced users. Besides the <b>Strobe</b> Center 5000, the AutoStrobe tuners are the only mechanical <b>strobe</b> tuners still made. Models include: ...|$|R
25|$|The {{best known}} brand in <b>strobe</b> tuner {{technology}} is Peterson Tuners who in 1967 marketed their first <b>strobe</b> tuner, the Model 400. Other companies, such as Sonic Research, TC Electronic, and Planet Waves, sell highly accurate LED-based true <b>strobe</b> tuners. Other LED tuners have a 'strobe mode' that emulates {{the appearance of}} a <b>strobe.</b> However, the accuracy of these tuners in <b>strobe</b> mode, while sufficient for most tuning, is no better than in any other mode, as they use the same technique as any basic tuner to measure frequency, only displaying {{it in a way that}} imitates a <b>strobe</b> tuner.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Strobe</b> tuners (the popular {{term for}} {{stroboscopic}} tuners) {{are the most}} accurate type of tuner. There are three types of <b>strobe</b> tuners: the mechanical rotating disk <b>strobe</b> tuner, an LED array <b>strobe</b> {{in place of the}} rotating disk, and [...] "virtual strobe" [...] tuners with LCDs or ones that work on personal computers. A <b>strobe</b> tuner shows the difference between a reference frequency and the musical note being played. Even the slightest difference between the two shows up as a rotating motion in the <b>strobe</b> display. The accuracy of the tuner is only limited by the internal frequency generator. The <b>strobe</b> tuner detects the pitch either from a TRS input jack or a built-in or external microphone connected to the tuner.|$|R
5|$|The video follows Ciara as {{she goes}} clubbing. The clip begins with the singer waking up at midnight, in a black, {{reflective}} apartment, as she is dressed in black and proceeds to leave through the building's fire escape. When she arrives outside, {{the windows of the}} building brighten and fade, and the moon, stars, and lamp posts create a strobe effect. White reflectors on the street sweep around Ciara and she is surrounded by dancers, many of whom are from the film, as they ascend a dark staircase and enter the club. When everyone arrives on the roof, Ciara meets up with Chamillionaire for his verse, and thereafter Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, the stars of Step Up, make appearances in dance sequences. The lights of the cityscape begin to pulse to the music, and rain falls on the crowd. Unilux <b>strobes</b> are used to highlight the rain.|$|E

2500|$|Peterson {{released}} a PC-based virtual <b>strobe</b> tuner in 2008 called [...] "StroboSoft". This computer software package {{has all the}} features of a virtual <b>strobe,</b> such as user-programmable temperaments and tunings. To use this tuner, a musician must have a computer next to the instrument to be tuned. An alternative is the PC-based <b>strobe</b> tuner TB <b>Strobe</b> Tuner with fewer functions.|$|R
25|$|SD {{cards and}} host devices {{initially}} communicate through a synchronous one-bit interface, where the host device provides a clock signal that <b>strobes</b> single bits {{in and out}} of the SD card. The host device thereby sends 48-bit commands and receives responses. The card can signal that a response will be delayed, but the host device can abort the dialogue.|$|E
25|$|Individual strobe flashes {{typically}} {{only last}} around 200 microseconds, {{but can be}} sustained for greater or lesser periods of time depending on the strobe's intended use. Some <b>strobes</b> even offer continuous mode of operation whereby the arc is sustained, providing extremely high intensity light, but usually only for small amounts of time to prevent overheating and eventual breakage of the flash tube.|$|E
25|$|SGM {{manufactures}} a {{wide range}} of products, from 3D domes, light strings and LED light tubes to high powered architectural wash lights and coloured and white colour <b>strobes.</b> SGM launched a suite of 20 new products in March 2012 at the Prolight+Sound trade fair in Germany. Twelve months later they launched the G-Spot IP-65 rated LED moving head profile spot.|$|E
5000|$|BenQ later {{developed}} their own native [...] "BenQ Blur Reduction" [...] technology, integrated into several of their gaming monitors. This offers a <b>strobe</b> backlight which can be easily turned on and off by the user. There is no control over the <b>strobe</b> timing or <b>strobe</b> length for the user, although third party utilities have been produced for this purpose. Newer firmware for the BenQ Blur Reduction monitors allow direct user control over the <b>strobe</b> pulse (timing) and <b>strobe</b> length (persistence) directly from the Service Menu. More customization is available by using a higher Vertical Total (from 1498-1502, depending on what does not cause errors), which effectively tricks the Mstar scaler into working with a larger blanking interval, as if the vertical screen size were longer. This effectively pushes the <b>strobe</b> crosstalk farther down {{the bottom of the}} display, improving <b>strobe</b> image quality, but with some drawbacks (like a faint scanlines effect, also seen in <b>strobe</b> LightBoost mode).|$|R
50|$|The {{years where}} the {{traditional}} golden waterfall effect {{have not been}} featured completely are; NYE 2000 (golden to silver), NYE 2002 (green & white <b>strobing</b> angelic), NYE 2005 (red to white <b>strobing</b> angelic), NYE 2006 (green <b>strobing</b> angelic).|$|R
50|$|There is an {{equivalent}} way {{to specify the}} relationship between Data and Strobe.For even-numbered Data bits, <b>Strobe</b> {{is the opposite of}} Data.For odd-numbered Data bits, <b>Strobe</b> is the same as Data.From this definition it is more obvious that the XOR of Data and <b>Strobe</b> will yield a clock signal. Also, it specifies the simplest means of generating the <b>Strobe</b> signal for a given Data stream.|$|R
25|$|As both {{mechanical}} and electronic <b>strobes</b> are still {{more expensive and}} arguably more difficult to use {{in order to achieve}} the desired results than ordinary tuners, their use is usually limited to those whose business it is accurately to intone and tune pianos, harps, and early instruments (e. g. harpsichords) on a regular basis: luthiers, instrument restorers and technicians – and instrument enthusiasts. These tuners make the intonation process more precise.|$|E
25|$|The strobe light, {{commonly}} called a strobe, is a device {{used to produce}} regular flashes of light. Modern uses of strobe lights serve a purpose for safety warning, and motion detection. <b>Strobes</b> can be found atop most police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks. The origin of strobe lighting dates to 1931, when Harold Eugene Edgerton invented a flashing lamp to make an improved stroboscope {{for the study of}} moving objects, eventually resulting in dramatic photographs of objects such as bullets in flight.|$|E
25|$|A strobe {{without a}} {{capacitor}} storage device simply discharges mains voltages across the tube once it's fired. This type of strobe requires no charging time {{and allows for}} much quicker flash rates, but drastically reduces the lifetime of the flash tube if powered for significant periods of time. Such <b>strobes</b> require a form of current limiting, because as mentioned above, an arc acts {{as a kind of}} short circuit. If this current limiting were to be eliminated, the flash tube would attempt to draw high currents from the electricity source, potentially tripping electrical breakers or causing voltage drops in the power supply line.|$|E

25|$|Sonic Research and Planet Waves both {{released}} a true-strobe with {{a bank of}} LEDs arranged in a circle that gives a strobing effect based upon {{the frequency of the}} input note. Both LCD and LED display true <b>strobes</b> do not require mechanical servicing and are much cheaper than the mechanical types. As such, they are a popular option for musicians who want the accuracy of a strobe without the high cost and the maintenance requirements. However, LED strobe displays offer no information about the harmonic structure of a note, unlike LCD types, which do offer four bands of consolidated information.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} the team had {{become aware of the}} UK's Gee efforts, and were aware that Gee used a system of {{electronically}} generated <b>strobes</b> that produced pips on the display that were accurately aligned with system timing. They sent a team to the UK to learn about the strobe concept, and immediately adopted it for their work. But as part of this exchange, the Project 3 team found that Gee was almost identical to their own system in concept and desired performance. Unlike their system, Gee had largely completed development and was proceeding to production. The decision was made to abandon the current efforts, use Gee on their own aircraft, and re-develop their system for the long-range role instead.|$|E
25|$|Passive marker systems, using {{reflective}} markers (typically reflective balls), {{allows for}} accurate measurement of movements using multiple cameras (typically five to twelve cameras), simultaneously. The cameras utilize high-powered <b>strobes</b> (typically red, near infrared or infrared) with matching filters {{to record the}} reflection from the markers placed on the body. Markers are located at palpable anatomical landmarks. Based on the angle and time delay between the original and reflected signal, triangulation of the marker in space is possible. Software is used to create three dimensional trajectories from these markers that are subsequently given identification labels. A computer model is then used to compute joint angles from the relative marker positions of the labeled trajectories. These are also used for motion capture in the motion picture industry.|$|E

25|$|While current {{technology}} is very effective at detecting smoke and fire conditions, the deaf and {{hard of hearing}} community has raised concerns {{about the effectiveness of}} the alerting function in awakening sleeping individuals in certain high-risk groups such as the elderly, those with hearing loss and those who are intoxicated. Between 2005 and 2007 research sponsored by the United States' National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) focused on understanding the cause of the higher number of deaths in such high-risk groups. Initial research into the effectiveness of the various alerting methods is sparse. Research findings suggest that a low frequency (520Hz) square wave output is significantly more effective at awakening high risk individuals. Wireless smoke and carbon monoxide detectors linked to alert mechanisms such as vibrating pillow pads for the hearing impaired, <b>strobes,</b> and remote warning handsets are more effective at waking people with serious hearing loss than other alarms.|$|E
25|$|Lighting {{designer}} Al Gurdon {{worked with}} Stufish and Tait Towers {{for the light}} setup, which was handled by PRG Group. The three main video screens were angled to give the side audience a better angle of vision. A Hippotizer V3 media server was used for content playback and operated by PRG Nocturne's Will Stinson, and five cameras were manned for this show. PRG used their newly invented GroundControl followspot devices which were attached as truss {{to the top of}} the screens, using Clay Paky Stormy <b>Strobes.</b> Fitted with high-definition cameras, they could be operated from backstage, who could simply use the cameras and direct the lights to illumate specific areas as required, without having to have knowledge about the physical stage. Console director Joshua Hutchings controlled their color, beams and shutters. Advantage of the followspot was to allow the lightning personnel to operate from a comfortable environment, rather than to climb on heights atop the stage. Hutchings explained the whole show was time-coded, going inline with the choreography.|$|E
25|$|In {{northern}} Iraq {{in early}} March, a small reconnaissance team from M Squadron of the British Special Boat Service mounted on Honda ATVs inserted into Iraq from Jordan, its first {{mission was to}} conduct reconnaissance of an Iraqi air base at al-Sahara. The team was compromised by an anti-special forces Fedayeen unit and barely escaped thanks to a U.S. F-15E that flew air cover for the team and the bravery of an RAF Chinook that extracted the team under the Fedayeen's 'noses'. A second larger SBS operation was launched by M Squadron in full strength in a mix of land rovers and ATVs into northern Iraq from H-2 airbase, the objective was to locate, make contact and take the surrender of the Iraqi 5th Army Corps somewhere past Tikrit and to survey and mark viable temporary landing zones for follow-on forces. However the Squadron was compromised by a goat herder; the SBS drove for several days whilst unknown to them anti-special forces Fedayeen units followed them. At an overnight position near Mosul, the Fedayeen ambushed the Squadron with DShK heavy machine guns and RPGs, the SBS returned fire and began taking fire from a T-72, the Squadron scattered and escaped the well-constructed trap. A number of Land Rovers became bogged down in a nearby wadi, so they mined the vehicles and abandoned them - though several did not detonate and were captured and exhibited on Iraqi television. The SBS was now in three distinct groups: one with several operational Land Rovers was being pursued by the Iraqi hunter force, a second mainly equipped with ATVs was hunkered down and trying to arrange extraction, the third with just 2 operators on an ATV raced for the Syrian border. The first group tried to call in coalition strike aircraft but the aircraft couldn't identify friendly forces because the SBS were not equipped with infra-red <b>strobes</b> - although their vehicles did have Blue Force Tracker units, they eventually made it to an emergency rendezvous point and were extracted by a RAF Chinook. The second group was also extracted by an RAF Chinook and the third group made it to Syria and was held there until their release was negotiated, there were no SBS casualties.|$|E
40|$|Objectives Appropriate {{reporting}} {{is central to}} the application of findings from research to clinical practice. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (<b>STROBE)</b> recommendations consist of a checklist of 22 items that provide guidance on the reporting of cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies, in order to facilitate critical appraisal and interpretation of results. <b>STROBE</b> was published in October 2007 in several journals including The Lancet, BMJ, Annals of Internal Medicine and PLoS Medicine. Within the framework of the revision of the <b>STROBE</b> recommendations, the authors examined the context and circumstances in which the <b>STROBE</b> statement was used in the past. Design The authors searched the Web of Science database in August 2010 for articles which cited <b>STROBE</b> and examined a random sample of 100 articles using a standardised, piloted data extraction form. The use of <b>STROBE</b> in observational studies and systematic reviews (including meta-analyses) was classified as appropriate or inappropriate. The use of <b>STROBE</b> to guide the reporting of observational studies was considered appropriate. Inappropriate uses included the use of <b>STROBE</b> as a tool to assess the methodological quality of studies or as a guideline on how to design and conduct studies. Results The authors identified 640 articles that cited <b>STROBE.</b> In the random sample of 100 articles, about half were observational studies (32 %) or systematic reviews (19 %). Comments, editorials and letters accounted for 15 %, methodological articles for 8 %, and recommendations and narrative reviews for 26 % of articles. Of the 32 observational studies, 26 (81 %) made appropriate use of <b>STROBE,</b> and three uses (10 %) were considered inappropriate. Among 19 systematic reviews, 10 (53 %) used <b>STROBE</b> inappropriately as a tool to assess study quality. Conclusions The <b>STROBE</b> reporting recommendations are frequently used inappropriately in systematic reviews and meta-analyses as an instrument to assess the methodological quality of observational studies...|$|R
5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic <b>strobe</b> unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual <b>strobe</b> for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the <b>strobe</b> unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the <b>strobe</b> would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the <b>strobe</b> in these cases.|$|R
