"spices, drugs, silks, calicos, quilts, {{carpets and}} colors, [...] The spices were pepper, cloves, maces, nutmegs, {{cinnamon}} and greene ginger: the drugs were benjamin, frankincense, Galangal, mirabilis, aloes zocotrina, camphire: the silks, damasks, taffatas, alto bassos, that is, counterfeit, [...] cloth of gold, unwrought China silk, sleeved silk, white twisted silk, curled cypresse.

2500|$|The challengers {{included}} Sir John Dudley, Sir [...] Thomas Seymour, Sir [...] Thomas Poyninge, Sir George Carew, Anthony Kingston, and Richard Cromwell. The challengers {{entered the}} lists that day richly dressed, their horses trapped in white velvet, with knights and gentlemen riding ahead of them, {{dressed in white}} velvet and white <b>sarcenet,</b> and all their servants in white <b>sarcenet</b> doublets and hose, in the Burgundian fashion.|$|E
2500|$|The English {{account is}} similar, but {{mentions}} {{the presence of}} five or six thousand horsemen and some foot soldiers, positioned to prevent the short march from Granton to Leith at a ford on the Water of Leith. The Cardinal was with this army but after a few shots and only a couple of casualties on either side, the Scots abandoned their position at the ford of a stream, leaving their eight cannon. (Lisle said two slings and three serpentines were placed to fire across the river, agreeing with Lee's plan). [...] The Earls of Huntly and Moray also left the field. Hertford's own dispatch describes this as a half hour fight, [...] "right sharply handled on both parts," [...] with Peter Mewtas's [...] hagbuters giving good service. The Admiral reported that Beaton stayed until he was in range of the handguns. He was wearing a frock of yellow velvet, cut and pulled out with white tinselled <b>sarcenet.</b>|$|E
60|$|The King sat upon a keg in {{the fore}} {{part of his}} ship, with little John of Richmond, who {{was no more than}} a schoolboy, perched upon his knee. Edward was clad in the black velvet jacket which was his {{favorite}} garb, and wore a small brown-beaver hat with a white plume at the side. A rich cloak of fur turned up with miniver drooped from his shoulders. Behind him were a score of his knights, brilliant in silks and <b>sarcenets,</b> some seated on an upturned boat and some swinging their legs from the bulwark.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me, fair sir," [...] said Stacy, with {{sparkling}} eyes, [...] "hast {{still left}} in yonder casket any rare jewels, rubies, <b>sarcenet,</b> or links of fine gold? Peradventure a pearl or two {{may have been}} overlooked!" ...|$|E
60|$|The turban, or head-dress, had a {{pinnacle}} on the top, but {{not above}} five inches, {{with a piece}} of loose <b>sarcenet</b> hanging from it; and on the front, just over the forehead, was a good jewel which I had added to it.|$|E
6000|$|Thers. Yes, meaning thy no meaning; pr'ythee, be silent, boy, I profit not by thy talk. Now {{the rotten}} {{diseases}} of the south, gut-gripings, ruptures, catarrhs, loads of gravel in the back, lethargies, cold palsies, and the like, take thee, and take thee again! thou green <b>sarcenet</b> flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's purse, thou! Ah how the poor world is pestered with such water-flies, such diminutives of nature! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God forgive me!" [...] {{said the}} poor young man. [...] "How {{to hide it}} I hardly know, but for her sake, ah--'twas that brought me here. She could not rest last night till I had promised to be here early enough {{in the morning to}} give you a piece of <b>sarcenet</b> to be matched in London. Where is it? Ah! I forget. It seems to be ages ago that she was insisting that I should ride over so as to be in time." ...|$|E
60|$|It was for {{the concert}} in the orchestra. A small party of dismal men in cocked hats were ‘executing’ the {{overture}} to Tancredi, and a numerous assemblage of ladies and gentlemen, with their families, had rushed from their half-emptied stout mugs in the supper boxes, and crowded to the spot. Intense was the low murmur of admiration when a particularly small gentleman, in a dress coat, led on a particularly tall lady in a blue <b>sarcenet</b> pelisse and bonnet of the same, ornamented with large white feathers, and forthwith commenced a plaintive duet.|$|E
60|$|Charles's first witness was Mrs. Lang, {{his late}} wife's 'own woman,' who spared him many {{questions}} by garrulously declaring 'what a work' poor little Madam had {{made about the}} rose-coloured <b>sarcenet,</b> causing the pattern to be searched {{out as soon as}} she came home from the bonfire, and how she had 'gone on at' her husband till he promised to give it to Mistress Anne, and how he had been astir at four o'clock in the morning, and had called to her (Mrs. Lang) to look to her mistress, who might perhaps get some sleep now that she had her will and hounded him out to go over to Portchester about that silk.|$|E
60|$|In {{the evening}} {{the village was}} lively with soldiers' wives; a tree full of {{starlings}} would not have rivalled the chatter that was going on. These ladies were very brilliantly dressed, with more regard for colour than for material. Purple, red, and blue bonnets were numerous, with bunches of cocks' feathers; and one had on an Arcadian hat of green <b>sarcenet,</b> turned up in front to show her cap underneath. It had once belonged to an officer's lady, and {{was not so much}} stained, except where the occasional storms of rain, incidental to a military life, had caused the green to run and stagnate in curious watermarks like peninsulas and islands. Some of the prettiest of these butterfly wives had been fortunate enough to get lodgings in the cottages, and were thus spared the necessity of living in huts and tents on the down. Those who had not been so fortunate were not rendered more amiable by the success of their sisters-in-arms, and called them names which brought forth retorts and rejoinders; till the end of these alternative remarks seemed dependent upon the close of the day.|$|E
6000|$|The mass of {{the people}} had by this time noticed the Queen and princesses at the window, and raised a cheer, to which the ladies waved their {{embroidered}} handkerchiefs. Anne went back towards the pavement with her trumpet-major, whom all the girls envied her, so fine-looking a soldier was he; and not only for that, {{but because it was}} well known that he was not a soldier from necessity, but from patriotism, his father having repeatedly offered to set him up in business: his artistic taste in preferring a horse and uniform to a dirty, rumbling flour-mill was admired by all. She, too, had a very nice appearance in her best clothes as she walked along--the <b>sarcenet</b> hat, muslin shawl, and tight-sleeved gown being of the newest Overcombe fashion, that was only about a year old in the adjoining town, and in London three or four. She could not be harsh to Loveday and dismiss him curtly, for his musical pursuits had refined him, educated him, and made him quite poetical. To-day he had been particularly well-mannered and tender; so, instead of answering, 'Never speak to me like this again,' she merely put him off with a 'Let us go back to David.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Sidenote: King Arthur and {{his companions}} are brought to speak with strange folk] The first party of the three was a knight of very haughty and noble appearance, clad all in armor as white as silver; and his jupon was white {{embroidered}} with silver, and the scabbard of the sword and the sword-belt were white, and his shield hung in the crab-tree above him and that, too, was all white as of silver. This knight still wore his helmet, so that his countenance {{was not to be}} seen. The second party of the three was a lady clad all in white raiment. Her face was covered by her wimple so that her countenance also was not to be seen very clearly, but her garments were of wonderful sort, being of white <b>sarcenet</b> embroidered over with silver in the pattern of lily flowers. Also she wore around her breast and throat a chain of shining silver studded with bright and sparkling gems of divers sorts. The third party of the three was a youth of eighteen years, so beautiful of face that it seemed to King Arthur that he had never beheld so noble a being. For his countenance was white and shining, and his hair was as soft as silk and as black as it was possible to be, and curled down upon his shoulders; and his eyes were large and bright and extraordinarily black, and his eyebrows arched so smoothly that if they had been painted they could not have been marked upon his forehead more evenly than they were; and his lips, which pouted a little, though not very much, were as red as coral, and his upper lip was shaded with a soft down of black. Moreover, this youth was clad altogether in white cloth of satin with no ornaments whatsoever saving only a fine chain of shining silver set with opal-stones and emeralds that hung about his neck.|$|E

The challengers {{entered the}} lists that day richly dressed, their horses trapped in white velvet, with knights and gentlemen riding ahead of them, {{dressed in white}} velvet and white <b>sarcenet,</b> and all their servants in white <b>sarcenet</b> doublets and hose, in the Burgundian fashion.|$|E
50|$|The new queen was {{provided}} with a large wardrobe of clothes, and her crimson state bed curtains made of Italian <b>sarcenet</b> were embroidered with red Lancastrian roses. Clothes were also made for her companion, Lady Catherine Gordon, the widow of Perkin Warbeck. In May 1503, James IV confirmed her possession of lands and houses in Scotland, including Methven Castle, Stirling Castle, Doune Castle, Linlithgow Palace and Newark Castle in Ettrick Forest, with the incomes from the corresponding Earldom and Lordship lands.|$|E
5000|$|The English {{account is}} similar, but {{mentions}} {{the presence of}} five or six thousand horsemen and some foot soldiers, positioned to prevent the short march from Granton to Leith at a ford on the Water of Leith.

There was also a rutter and a document, printed at Macau in 1590, containing valuable information on the China and Japan trade; Hakluyt observed that it was [...] "enclosed {{in a case of}} sweet Cedar wood, and lapped up almost an hundredfold in fine Calicut-cloth, {{as though it had been}} some incomparable jewel".|$|E
