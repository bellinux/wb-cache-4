Open-die forging gets its name {{from the fact that the}} dies (the surfaces that are in contact with the workpiece) do not enclose the workpiece, allowing it to flow except where contacted by the dies. The operator therefore needs to orient and position the workpiece to get the desired shape. The dies are usually flat in shape, but some have a specially shaped surface for specialized operations. For example, a die may have a round, concave, or convex surface or be a tool to form holes or be a cut-off tool.Open-die forgings can be worked into shapes which include discs, hubs, blocks, <b>shafts</b> (including <b>step</b> <b>shafts</b> or with flanges), sleeves, cylinders, flats, hexes, rounds, plate, and some custom shapes.Open-die forging lends itself to short runs and is appropriate for art smithing and custom work.

Each generation of engineers has used that part of mechanics of materials theory that fit the calculating capability available to them. The method presented here is offered in that vein. The method uses an engineer's ability to construct free body diagrams, derive moment equations, and knowledge of energy methods. The problem solution is kept general until the last step which is a digital numerical integration. The digital numerical integration can be performed {{on a wide variety of}} software to include TKSolver�, MatLab �, MathCad �, EES � and spread sheets. This method keeps the section properties independent of the moment equations making it straightforward to include scaling and shape factors on the cross-sectional dimensions. This allows an engineer to run any number of "what if " scenarios during a design process. Additionally, this method provides intermediate opportunities to validate the solution path by a) plotting the moment equation and comparing it against shear and moment diagram developed by hand, or b) plotting the cross section and comparing it against the drawings.
