40|$|AbstractDoubly-fed {{induction}} generator {{is widely used}} in wind turbine conversion systems. Several research works are being made to efficiently approve existing condition monitoring and fault detection techniques for these systems. The condition monitoring of these systems {{becomes more and more}} important, the main obstacle in this task is the lack of an accurate analytical model to describe a faulty DFIG in the majority of the research tasks. In this paper, we present the monitoring strategy of <b>short-circuit</b> fault <b>between</b> <b>turns</b> of the stator windings and open stator phases in doubly-fed {{induction generator}} by fuzzy logic technique. The stator condition monitoring is diagnosed based on the root mean square values of current magnitude in addition to the knowledge expressed in rules and membership function. The proposed strategy is verified using simulations performed via the model of Doubly-fed induction generator built in Mat Lab ® SIMULINK...|$|R

MOSFETs from different manufacturers {{have been tested}} and show different failure modes. A gate leakage current is detected before failure but is not necessarily responsible for the failure. For some tested devices, the failure appears in an open state mode after physical <b>short-circuit</b> <b>between</b> gate and source. The main failure mode is nevertheless a physical <b>short-circuit</b> <b>between</b> drain and source.

50|$|A {{standard}} stereo jack {{is used on}} most battery-powered guitar effects pedals {{to eliminate}} the need for a separate power switch. In this configuration, the internal battery has its negative terminal wired to the sleeve contact of the jack. When the user plugs in a two-conductor (mono) guitar or microphone lead, the resulting <b>short-circuit</b> <b>between</b> sleeve and ring connects an internal battery to the unit's circuitry, ensuring that it powers up or down automatically whenever a signal lead is inserted or removed.

50|$|Due to oxidation, {{the copper}} {{cladding}} darkens {{with age and}} MICC is therefore often used in historic buildings such as castles where it blends in with stonework. However, where MICC cables with a bare copper sheath are installed in damp locations, particularly where lime mortar has been used, the water and lime combine to create an electrolytic action with the bare copper. Similarly, electrolytic action may also be caused by installing bare-sheath MICC cables on new oak. The reaction causes the copper to be eaten away, making {{a hole in the}} side of the cable and letting in water, causing a <b>short-circuit</b> <b>between</b> live, neutral and earth. The appearance of green verdigris on the bare copper sheath may be a sign this has occurred.|$|R
40|$|Abstract.

Two destructive failures were identified in a storage life test at 500 ˚C: a <b>short-circuit</b> <b>between</b> the source and the gate and a disconnection at the n+ source contact. The former was caused by interlayer dielectric erosion and/or Al spearing into the poly-Si gate; the latter was caused by the disappearance of the NiSix contact layer.

2500|$|Another {{alternative}} {{replaces the}} half bridge MMC submodule described above, {{with a full}} bridge submodule containing four IGBTs in an H bridge arrangement, instead of two. [...] The full-bridge variant of MMC allows the submodule capacitor to be inserted into the circuit in either polarity. [...] This confers additional flexibility in controlling the converter and allows the converter to block the fault current which arises from a <b>short-circuit</b> <b>between</b> {{the positive and negative}} DC terminals (something which is impossible with any of the preceding types of VSC). [...] Furthermore it allows the DC voltage to be of either polarity (like a LCC HVDC scheme), giving rise to the possibility of hybrid LCC and VSC HVDC systems. However, the full-bridge arrangement requires twice as many IGBTs and has higher power losses than the equivalent half-bridge arrangement.|$|R
