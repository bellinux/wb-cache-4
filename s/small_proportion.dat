A similarly <b>small</b> <b>proportion</b> experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E

40|$|Researchers often {{face the}} problem of {{accurately}} calculating the power for tests of differences between two independent proportions. The method for calculating the exact power of these tests requires an extremely time-consuming, iterative process using 2 X 2 contingency tables. A common approach to circumventing this arduous process is to use an approximation of the power. Four commonly used, and historically accepted, approximations are the arc sine, the chi-squared, and the two continuity-corrected versions {{of each of these}} approximations. We will discuss comparisons of all of these approximations for detecting differences between relatively large proportions, when sample size is 30, that have been provided by previous publications; and we will present data for and discuss these same comparisons for <b>smaller</b> <b>proportions.</b> We will also present data for and discuss comparisons of all of these approximations for detecting differences between relatively <b>small</b> <b>proportions,</b> where the larger proportion is between 0. 01 and 0. 05 and the <b>smaller</b> <b>proportion</b> ranges from 0. 001 to 0. 007, for a sample size of 300. Finally, we will present data for and discuss the accuracy of the two corrected approximations for detecting differences of relatively <b>small</b> <b>proportions</b> for sample sizes of 300...|$|R

5|$|A {{relatively}} <b>small</b> <b>proportion</b> {{of total}} membership comes from Canada. A growing {{portion of the}} Canadian demographic {{is made up of}} immigrant members of the church. This is partly the result of Canadian demographics as a whole, and partly due to decreased interest amongst late generation Canadians. The largest concentration of active congregations in Canada are in Southern Ontario, with notable congregations gathering in Beamsville, Bramalea, Niagara Falls, Vineland, Toronto (several), and Waterloo. Although many congregations of various sizes (typically under 300 members) meet all across Canada.|$|E

Bushfire kills the {{maternal}} plant, which has neither thick bark nor lignotubers, but the subsequent shedding of seed allows {{the population to}} regenerate.

In addition, up to 85% of the T3 in blood is produced following conversion from T4 by iodothyronine deiodinases in organs around the body.|$|E

5|$|Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne {{tropical}} disease {{caused by the}} dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In a <b>small</b> <b>proportion</b> of cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.|$|E
5|$|In {{assessing}} peacefulness, the GPI {{investigates the}} extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a <b>small</b> <b>proportion</b> of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be equated with peacefulness.|$|E

Insect larvae and eggs are eaten as well as spiders. Seeds and other plant material make up only a very <b>small</b> <b>proportion</b> of its diet. It can be found hunting for insects in leaf litter, shrubbery and on the edges of bodies of water, mostly in the morning and late afternoon.
