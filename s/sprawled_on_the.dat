Next to the poet's wife, by the open door, an angry milkmaid presents her substantial bill, demanding payment for milk, underlining the poet's refusal to provide for his family by getting himself a proper job. The cupboard stands open and empty, save for a mouse; near the door, a dog steals {{the last of the}} family's food from a plate.|$|E
25|$|The rear {{battalion}} was the 4th Sikh Infantry, {{which reached}} Candeapar {{in the early}} hours of 19 December, and not to be bogged down by the absence of the Borim bridge (already blown up), went across the Zuari river in their military tankers and then waded across a small creek, in chest high water, to reach a small dock known as Embarcadouro de Tembim in Raia, presently under survey No.44/5 of Raia Village, from where there exists a connecting road to Margão (Old Portuguese Planta 4489 & 4493). At Tembim the 4th Sikh Infantry rear battalion, took some rest in a cattle shed on the small dock, and <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and in the balcony of a house adjacent to the dock, drank some water, retrieved their tankers and then proceeded to Margão—the administrative centre of Southern Goa—by 12:00. From here, the column advanced towards the harbour of Mormugão. En route to this target, the column encountered fierce resistance from a 500-strong Portuguese unit at the village of Verna, where the Indian column was joined by the 2nd Bihar. The Portuguese unit surrendered at 15:30 after fierce fighting, and the 4th Sikh then proceeded to Mormugão and Dabolim Airport, where the main body of the Portuguese Army awaited the Indians.|$|E
500|$|In old age, Bush {{continued}} to lead {{an active and}} productive life, punctuated by periodic commemorations {{of his life and}} works. [...] In November 1975 his 50 years' professorship at the RAM was marked in a concert there, and in January 1976 the WMA gave a concert to honour his recent 75th birthday. In 1977 he produced his last major piano work, the Twenty-four Preludes, Op. 84, of which he gave the first performance at the Wigmore Hall on 30 October 1977. A later [...] reviewer described this piece as [...] "music I'd like to have playing beside me as I <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass beneath the trees with an ice-cream, watching a county cricket match on a golden afternoon".|$|E

2500|$|On 13 May, McCloughan's company air {{assaulted}} into {{a landing}} zone near Tam Kỳ and Nui Yon Hill, coming under small arms and machine gun fire from defending North Vietnamese Army (NVA) forces. Two helicopters were downed over the landing zone, {{one of which}} crashed around [...] from Company C's positions. A rescue helicopter was prevented from landing due to fierce enemy fire, and a squad was sent out to rescue the pilot and crew. Upon reaching the crash site, they saw a badly wounded soldier <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, and McCloughan ran [...] to him through an open field, dodging the fire of his unit and a charging NVA platoon. After reaching the wounded soldier, McCloughan carried him {{over his shoulder and}} ran back to Company C, thus saving the man from capture or death.|$|E
2500|$|Anderson {{had told}} Starr on the {{sideline}} that he could pick up 8 to 10 yards on dump passes since the Dallas linebackers were laying back. [...] Starr used this tip to complete two passes to Anderson for 12 and 9 yards, gaining a key first down on the Dallas 30. Anderson juked linebacker Chuck Howley on both plays and ran by him as Howley <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> icy turf. Mercein told Starr he was also open on the left, and Starr flipped him a pass that the fullback carried down to the Cowboys 11-yard line and out of bounds with 1:11 to play. Then Starr called a play he had kept ready for the right situation, 54-Give, a play that Lombardi frankly called the [...] "sucker" [...] play in the Packer playbook. Left guard Gale Gillingham pulled to his right {{like it was a}} typical sweep, and Cowboy right tackle Bob Lilly with his great reflexes instantly followed him. The Packers' left tackle Bob Skoronski blocked Cowboy end George Andrie and Mercein shot through the hole to the 3-yard line.|$|E
2500|$|On , Catherine rose {{early in}} the morning and had her usual morning coffee, soon {{settling}} down to work on papers at her study. Her lady's maid, Maria Perekusikhina, had asked the Empress if she had slept well, and Catherine reportedly replied she had not slept so well in a long time. Sometime after 9:00 that morning, Catherine went to her dressing room and collapsed from a stroke while on the toilet. Worried by Catherine's absence, her attendant, Zakhar Zotov, opened the door and peered in. Catherine was <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. Her face appeared purplish, her pulse was weak, and her breathing was shallow and laboured. The servants lifted Catherine from the floor and brought her to the bedroom. Some 45 minutes later, the royal court's Scottish physician, Dr. John Rogerson, arrived and determined that Catherine had suffered a stroke. Despite all attempts to revive the Empress, she fell into a coma from which she never recovered. Catherine was given the last rites and died the following evening around 9:45. An autopsy performed on her body the next day confirmed the cause of death as stroke. (Later, several unfounded stories circulated regarding the cause and manner of her death.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Reports {{initially}} {{stated that}} Nagai {{was hit by}} stray bullets fired by soldiers or possibly shot from the front. The [...] "stray bullet" [...] explanation was proposed {{by the government of}} Myanmar as an explanation for Nagai's death. However, video footage obtained by Japanese television appears to show a Burmese soldier shoving Nagai to the ground and shooting him at point-blank range. A still image photographed by Adrees Latif showed the soldier standing over Nagai, who was <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and still clutching his camera. This photograph appeared {{on the front page of}} The New York Times on September 28, 2007. A subsequent shot showed Nagai's body sprawled in the street as the soldier walked away. Judging from the patch, the soldier responsible is believed to be from one of the Light Infantry Divisions (possibly LID 66) in charge of crowd control in Yangon at the time of protests. At the Japanese embassy in Myanmar, a physician established the trajectory of the fatal bullet that killed Nagai, determining that the bullet entered Nagai's chest from the lower right side and pierced his heart before exiting from his back.|$|E

60|$|He leapt for the door, {{slamming}} {{it behind}} him. The square was deserted. In {{front of the}} house was a baker's van. Evidently he was to have been taken out of London in that, and his body found many miles from the house in Soho. The driver jumped to the pavement and tried to bar Tommy's way. Again Tommy's fist shot out, and the driver <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pavement.|$|E

60|$|The {{door closed}} silently, and was opened {{a little later}} by the dubious George coming in to set a {{bountiful}} repast.

He finished at last, and after sitting for some time smoking, with his legs <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fender, rang for a candle and demanded to be shown to his room.|$|E
60|$|Tom Spink merely {{rolled his}} quid {{with his tongue}} and {{regarded}} me with sneering thoughtfulness. I am sure he was no more surprised than was I by the immediateness of what followed. My fist went out like an arrow from a released bow, and Tom Spink staggered back, tripped against {{the corner of the}} tarpaulin-covered sounding-machine, and <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deck. He tried to make a fight of it, but I followed him up, giving him no chance to set himself or recover from the surprise of my first onslaught.|$|E
6000|$|The Irishman swung ponderously. Billy ducked, cutting his apology short, {{and as the}} sledge-like fist {{passed over}} his head, he drove his left to the other's jaw. The big Irishman toppled over sidewise and <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of the slope. Half-scrambled back {{to his feet and}} out of balance, he was caught by Bert's fist, and this time went clawing down the slope that was {{slippery}} with short, dry grass. Bert was redoubtable. [...] "That for you, old girl--my compliments," [...] was his cry, as he shoved the woman over the edge on to the treacherous slope. Three more men were emerging from the brush.|$|E
60|$|The boys {{retired as}} usual that night, and slept soundly until about five {{o'clock in the}} morning, when a {{tremendous}} thump <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vessel's side aroused them and threw Chet <b>sprawling</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor.|$|R
60|$|The {{boy from}} <b>the</b> country was <b>on</b> guard, and ducked with a quickness that {{surprised}} his antagonist. Then he gave Merwell's arm a twist that sent <b>the</b> tall youth <b>sprawling</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice.|$|R
60|$|Before {{he could}} answer {{there came a}} great clatter behind them, and a boy of my own age appeared. With a leap he landed <b>sprawling</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{indolent}} gentleman's shoulders, nearly upsetting him.|$|R
60|$|Children {{and babies}} <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{sidewalk}} and under their feet. Bareheaded and unkempt women gossiped in the doorways or passed {{back and forth}} with scant marketings in their arms. There was a general odor of decaying fruit and fish, a smell of staleness and putridity. Big hulking men slouched by, and ragged little girls walked gingerly through the confusion with foaming buckets of beer in their hands. There was a clatter and garble of foreign tongues and brogues, shrill cries, quarrels and wrangles, and the Pit pulsed with a great and steady murmur, like the hum of the human hive that it was.|$|E
60|$|There on {{the back}} of a chair hung, pathetically empty and formless, the red wrapper with black dots that she always wore while getting the meals. Her week-day clothes had been tossed here and there in her haste. A little paper bag of her {{favorite}} butter-scotch lay with its string yet unwound. A daily paper <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, gaping rectangularly where a railroad time-table had been clipped from it. Everything in the room spoke of a loss, of an essence gone, of its soul and life departed. John Perkins stood among the dead remains with a queer feeling of desolation in his heart.|$|E
60|$|The {{proprietor}} {{served him}} obsequiously {{but did not}} venture to talk. There were five or six workingmen in the shop discussing {{the value of a}} gentleman's estate in County Kildare They drank at intervals from their huge pint tumblers and smoked, spitting often on the floor and sometimes dragging the sawdust over their spits with their heavy boots. Mr. Duffy sat on his stool and gazed at them, without seeing or hearing them. After a while they went out and he called for another punch. He sat a long time over it. The shop was very quiet. The proprietor <b>sprawled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> counter reading the Herald and yawning. Now and again a tram was heard swishing along the lonely road outside.|$|E
60|$|It {{was seen}} that La Corne was indeed retreating. The French {{soldiers}} and the Indians were running in all directions, {{and in the}} excitement {{a dozen or more}} were sent <b>sprawling</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shore.|$|R
