The balance between the luciferase expression levels was also affected by the identity of the untranslated regions (UTRs) as well as segment length. In general it appeared that <b>genome</b> <b>segments</b> displaying inherent higher expression levels were more efficient competitors of another <b>segment.</b> When natural <b>genome</b> <b>segments</b> were tested for their ability to suppress reporter gene expression, shorter <b>genome</b> <b>segments</b> generally reduced firefly luciferase expression to a larger extent, with the M and NS segments having the largest effect.

Furthermore, only reporter <b>genome</b> <b>segments</b> carrying these mutations were able to efficiently compete with the natural <b>genome</b> <b>segments</b> in infected cells.

This reassortment accelerates evolution by breaking linkage, helping IAV cross species barriers to potentially create highly virulent strains.

We applied a novel deep sequencing approach with quan-titative analysis to assess the in vitro temporal evolution of genomic reassortment in IAV. The combination of H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 strains reproducibly generated a new H 1 N 2 strain with the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein segments originating from H 1 N 1 and the remaining six segments from H 3 N 2. By deep sequencing the entire viral genome, we monitored the evolution of reassortment, quantifying the relative abundance of all IAV genome segments from the two parent strains over time and measuring the selection coefficients of the reassorting segments.
