40|$|There is a {{worldwide}} {{increasing use of}} herbs which are often administered in combination with therapeutic drugs, raising the potential for herb-drug interactions. St John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> (Hypericum perforatum) {{is one of the}} most commonly used herbal antidepressants. A literature search was performed using Medline (via Pubmed), Biological Abstracts, Cochrane Library, AMED, PsycINFO and Embase (all from their inception to September 2003) to identify known drug interaction with St John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort.</b> The available data indicate that St John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> is a potent inducer of CYP 3 A 4 and P-glycoprotein (PgP), although it may inhibit or induce other CYPs, depending on the dose, route and duration of administration. Data from human studies and case reports indicate that St John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> decreased the blood concentrations of amitriptyline, cyclosporine, digoxin, fexofenadine, indinavir, methadone, midazolam, nevirapine, phenprocoumon, simvastatin, tacrolimus, theophylline and warfarin, whereas it did not alter the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, dextromethorphan, mycophenolic acid and pravastatin. St John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> decreased the plasma concentration of the active metabolite SN- 38 in cancer patients receiving irinotecan treatment. St John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> did not alter the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide, but increased the incidence of hypoglycaemia. Several cases have been reported that St John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> decreased cyclosporine blood concentration leading to organ rejection. St John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> caused breakthrough bleeding and unplanned pregnancies when used concomitantly with oral contraceptives. It also caused serotonin syndrome when coadministered with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (e. g. sertaline and paroxetine). Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic components may play a role in these interactions. Because the potential interaction of St John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> with other drugs is a major safety concern, additional systematic research on herb-drug interactions and appropriate regulation in herbal safety and efficacy is needed...|$|R

40|$|Objectives:This study {{examined}} the effects of St John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> (Hypericum perforatum) on the disposition of fexofenadine, a substrate of P-glycoprotein/organic anion transporting polypeptide, in the isolated perfused rat liver. Methods:Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given St John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort,</b> 1000  mg/kg, by intragastric gavage once daily for 14  days. On day 15, livers were isolated surgically and perfused in a recirculating system with fexofenadine (2  μg/ml), either alone or following addition of ciclosporin (0. 5  μg/ml) 5  min before the addition of fexofenadine. Perfusate samples and bile were collected for 60  min. Fexofenadine in perfusate, bile and the homogenised livers was measured by HPLC. Key findings:Administration of St John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> significantly increased biliary clearance with respect to perfusate and biliary clearance with respect to the concentration in the liver, by 74...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{burden of}} rising health care {{expenditures}} {{has created a}} demand for information regarding the clinical and economic outcomes associated with Complementary and Alternative Medicines. Clinical controlled trials have found St. John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> to {{be as effective as}} antidepressants in the treatment of mild to moderate depression. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a model to assess the cost-effectiveness of St. John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> based on this evidence. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to estimate health and economic impacts of St. John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> versus antidepressants. Outcomes were treatment costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and Net Monetary Benefits (NMB). Probabilistic analyses were conducted on key model parameters. Results: The average NMB across 5000 simulations identified St. John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> as the strategy with the highest net benefit. The total cost savings for SJW were 359. 66 and 202. 56 per individual for venlafaxine and sertraline respectively, with a gain of 0. 08 to 0. 12 QALYs over the 72 weeks of the model. Limitations: A lack of direct comparative clinical trial data comparing SJW to venlafaxine and limited data with sertraline as a comparator was a major limitation. Conclusions: In this model, St. John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> was shown to be a cost-effective alternative to generic antidepressants. Patients are more likely to receive treatment for a duration consistent with professional guidelines for treatment of major depression due to reduced incidence of adverse effects, improving outcomes. This represents an important option in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Ponds are a {{chain of}} shallow lakes at the {{headwaters}} of the Baker Branch <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> River in the North Maine Woods. The flow sequence is from the Upper First <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond, through the Lower First <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond, Second <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond, Third <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond, and Fourth <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond to the Fifth <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond. Flow from one pond to the next is sometimes called Baker Stream rather than the Baker Branch <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> River. Great Northern Paper Company dug a canal from Fifth <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond 2 mi eastward to the North Branch Penobscot River in 1939, and built a dam {{at the north end of}} Fifth <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> Pond so pulpwood logs harvested in the upper <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> River watershed could be floated down the Penobscot River to Millinocket, Maine. The canal and dam have fallen into disrepair so most drainage from the ponds again flows down the <b>Saint</b> <b>John</b> River. All upstream ponds with the exception of the first had dams to regulate discharge flow for log driving, but those dams have similarly fallen into disrepair. Moose use the ponds as summer refuge from heat and biting insects.|$|R
