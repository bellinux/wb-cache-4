5|$|Mary Patricia Mohan {{was born}} at 2 Third Avenue, Fazakerley, Liverpool. After two years Mary's father met and married his second wife, Rose, while {{on a trip to}} Monaghan, in Ireland. Rose arrived in Liverpool with two {{children}} from a previous marriage, but Mary, who had until then been looking after the Mohan family, realised that Rose did not care much for domesticity or her new husband's children. After a year she chose to live with her aunts. In 1923, at the age of 14 years, Mary started work as a nurse trainee at the Smithdown Road Hospital, and then took a three-year training course at Walton Road Hospital in Rice Lane, Liverpool, eventually becoming a <b>state</b> <b>registered</b> <b>nurse.</b>|$|E

He became suspicious at the note from Ada Baguley that authorised cremation and ordered a post-mortem.

40|$|To {{ensure that}} future mental health nurses are {{competent}} practitioners, nursing knowledge {{needs to be}} passed from current practicing mental health nurses to nursing students while they learn and practise their craft within their clinical area. The role the mental health nurse has in ensuring clinical competence and instilling confidence in students {{is an integral part}} of the success of the future mental health nursing workforce. Internationally countries such as Finland, New Zealand, Ireland and the United Kingdom also all have competency standards for the <b>registered</b> <b>nurse</b> which specifically <b>state</b> that <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> are required to support baccalaureate degree nursing students.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Human Resource Management)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2015. Occupational {{challenges}} {{exist in}} all working environments, and affect {{all levels of}} organisational personnel from top management to employee levels. State hospitals in South Africa place occupational demands mainly upon <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> who make {{up most of the}} hospital staff. The focus of the research investigation concentrated mainly on a population of three groups of <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> at a <b>state</b> hospital in Cape Town. They are staff nurses, professional nurses and enrolled nursing assistants. These nurses are experiencing a decline in morale, due to staff shortages, a lack of resources and a perceived lack of leadership. They experience various levels of stress, which affect their personal health and morale. The objective of the research was to analyse the impact on the <b>state</b> <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> of three main contributors of occupational challenges faced by these nurses, namely a lack of resources, staff shortages and a perceived lack of good leadership. The nurses are employed to provide quality care for patients in state hospitals...|$|R
40|$|Although {{hospital}} work organization affects patient {{outcomes and}} in some <b>states</b> <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> (R.

After controlling for patient and hospital characteris-tics, the authors find that hospitals with unionized R. N. ’s have 5. 5 % lower heart-attack mortality than do non-union hospitals. This result remains substantively unchanged when the analysis accounts for possible selection bias—specifically, the possibility that unionized hospitals have certain important but unobservable characteristics, independent of unionization, that affect patient care. *Michael Ash is Assistant Professor, Department of Economics and Center for Public Policy and Ad...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a widely}} held belief among doctors and nurses that when a {{colleague}} is in hospital, if anything can go wrong {{during the course of}} his illness it invariably will. To investigate this belief, we studied prospectively a group of pregnant doctors and doctors' wives, comparing the number of obstetric, paediatric, and psychiatric complications with those in two control groups of similar social class, race, and parity. These were teachers and lecturers and a group of <b>State</b> <b>registered</b> <b>nurses.</b> The occurrence of obstetric and paediatric problems was similar in the three groups. Psychiatric problems, however, were more common among teachers and lecturers (p less than 0. 001); this difference was due to the way the nurses on the postnatal wards failed to report mild psychiatric problems among doctors' wives to their colleagues. This difference was not related to the amount of preferential treatment that doctors and doctors' wives received while in hospital...|$|R

Using a variety of strategies to adapt to their racial and subaltern positions within clinical spaces, African women played a pivotal role in not only nursing sick bodies, but also nursing the nation, and their struggles within and outside hospitals were part of the larger struggles by ordinary Zimbabweans for self-determination and equality in colonial and post colonial Zimbabwe...|$|R

Treatment is critically important to controlling these diseases, especially among adolescents, young adults, and certain racial groups where rates remain high. In April of 2008, Senate Bill 1078 was passed which amends ARS 32 - 1401. 27 and 32 - 1854 to allow allopathic, naturopathic, and osteopathic physicians, or physician assistants to dispense or prescribe antimicrobial medications to contacts of patients with communicable diseases without an intervening health assessment of the partner.

40|$|Factors, which induced {{positive}} nurse-client interac-tions {{and barriers}} to positive nurse-client interactions {{from the perspective}} of nurses at Holy Family Hos-pital, were explored. In all, twelve <b>State</b> <b>Registered</b> <b>Nurses</b> participated in semi-structured interviews. Factors which induced positive nurse-client interac-tion included availability of adequate time, showing empathy, giving prompt care, considering nursing as a call (spiritual interpretation) and rendering holistic care. Factors which induced negative nurse-client interaction included differences in beliefs between the nurse and the client, perceptions of unfair treatment, payment requirement and processes, issues with clients’ relatives, client issues, miscommunications and misunderstandings about treatment needs, coer-cion, forced dependence, human resource issues, professional nursing issues, issues with work envi-ronment, nurse issues, lack of communication and good interaction, and dropping of professional ethics. Suggestions for nursing education, practice and ad-ministration have been outlined. Among them is the need to use role-play as a major teaching method for nursing students to develop empathic behaviours so that they can put themselves in clients’ situations. This understanding will allow them to practise quality nursing after completing their educational programs. There is also the need for policy makers in nursing to institute measures to hold nurses accountable if they abuse clients or clients’ relatives. Lastly, as an important tool, nurses and other health care workers can make use of reflective practice to evaluate their professional interactions with clients and their relatives. This will foster positive nurse-client interaction in future...|$|R
