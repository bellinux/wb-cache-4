2500|$|The M1895 was {{equipped}} with a ladder-type rear sight adjustable {{to a maximum of}} 2,000 yards, determined by actual firing at Winchester in March 1896. [...] Because of the relatively high velocity and flat trajectory of the 6mm Lee cartridge, authorities calibrated the sights at their lowest setting with a point-blank or dead aim range of 725 yards (663 m). [...] The latter was intended for use on targets at all ranges from point-blank to 700 yards. [...] The single battle setting was intended to discourage individual soldiers or marines from adjusting their sight elevation unless firing at mass targets at extreme ranges, in which case officers would give commands for ranges to be set in such situations. [...] Owing to the necessity of supplying the Navy with rifles as soon as practicable, no provision for drift (windage) was included in the rear sight. [...] The prominence of the front sight and its exposure to damage led to the adoption of a sheet metal front <b>sight</b> <b>cover</b> for the 10,000 rifles in the original order. [...] The front <b>sight</b> <b>cover</b> was browned (blued) to reduce glare. [...] Each rifle was tested at Winchester for accuracy by firing a group of three shots at 50 yards, any rifle not showing the desired accuracy was returned to the line for adjustment, which sometimes involved restocking the entire rifle.|$|E

Old habit made the little beaded <b>sight</b> <b>cover</b> first the stately leader. Bang! The gray monarch leaped straight forward, forehoofs up, antlered head back, to fall dead with a crash. Then {{for a few moments}} the Winchester spat a deadly stream of fire, and when emptied was thrown down for the other gun, which in the steady, sure hands of the hunter belched death to the caribou.|$|E

60|$|A slight {{movement}} {{far ahead}} caught my eye, and I saw a hare gliding and dodging among the brown ferns. He came slowly in our direction, hopping and halting and wiggling {{his nose at}} every bush, till he heard our approach and rose on his hind legs to listen. He gave a great jump as Unk Wunk hove into <b>sight,</b> <b>covered</b> all over with the dead leaves that his barbed quills had picked up on his way downhill, and lay quiet where he thought the ferns would hide him.|$|R
60|$|Size of Gun.--American bushrangers {{advocate}} a long heavy pea-rifle, on the plea of its accurate shooting, {{and the enormous}} saving in weight of ammunition when bullets of a small size are used. The objections to small-bored rifles are, insufficiency against large game (even with conical bullets), and a tendency to become foul after a few shots. A short light rifle, whether with a large or a small bore, is, I believe, utterly worthless. In {{the hands of a}} man trembling with running and with exhaustion, it shakes like a wand: the shorter the rifle, the more quickly does it oscillate, and of course, in the same proportion, is it difficult to catch the exact moment when the <b>sights</b> <b>cover</b> the object.|$|R

50|$|Newer {{variants}} of the C7/C8 family {{have since been}} integrated into common use throughout the Canadian Armed Forces. The C7 has most recently been updated in the form the C7A2. The major internal components remain the same, however, several changes {{have been made to}} increase versatility of the rifle. Changes include adding a TRI-Ad rail mount system to the front iron sight which allows accessories such as laser designators and tac lights to be added. Also, the fire control selector lever has been made ambidextrous in addition to the cocking lever. A much needed 4-position telescopic butt-stock has been added to better accommodate different sized shooters. But, perhaps most obviously the rifle has undergone some aesthetic changes, moving away from the traditional all black rifle to one with olive green in the hand guards, pistol grip and <b>sight</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{microhabitat}} {{selection of}} two hand-reared polecats, Mustela putorius Linnaeus, 1758, {{was investigated in}} an experimental outdoor enclosure. The animals showed a finely-scaled preference for densely structured microhabitats even within a habitat offering cover (oak forest). Experimental modifications of the vegetation cover resulted in significant changes of microhabitat use. Given the choice of dense veg-etation, and bare ground with complete <b>sight</b> <b>cover</b> f rom above, the polecats preferred bare ground. The origin and function of the describ-ed microhabitat preference are discussed, using the experimental results and literature. It is hypothized that (1) a preference for <b>sight</b> <b>cover</b> is innate to polecats and (2) this is an adaptation to anuran microhabitat use, or to predation pressure...|$|E
50|$|The {{front sight}} {{is mounted on}} the gas block which makes for one less {{attachment}} to the barrel, adding to the mechanical accuracy. The front sight is fully adjustable in the field by the soldier. There is also a flip up tritium night <b>sight</b> that <b>covers</b> the front post for low light shooting.|$|R
6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} the lots were drawn, and the {{shooting}} began. Each hunter wiped out the barrel of his piece with his ramrod as he stepped forward; then, placing a ball {{in the palm of his}} left hand, he drew the stopper of his powder-horn with his teeth, and poured out as much powder as sufficed to cover the bullet. This was the regular measure among them. Little time was lost in firing, for these men did not [...] "hang" [...] on their aim. The point of the rifle was slowly raised to the object, and, the instant the <b>sight</b> <b>covered</b> it, the ball sped to its mark. In {{a few minutes}} the nail was encircled by bullet-holes, scarcely two of which were more than an inch distant from the mark, and one--fired by Joe Blunt--entered the tree close beside it.|$|R

60|$|Wetzel's {{face was}} white when {{he raised the}} rifle; his dark eye, gleaming vengefully, ran along the barrel. The little bead on the front <b>sight</b> first <b>covered</b> the British officer, and then the broad breast of Girty.

60|$|For {{an instant}} Druse had a strange, half-defined {{feeling that he}} had slept {{to the end of}} the war and was looking upon a noble work of art reared upon that {{commanding}} eminence to commemorate the deeds of an heroic past of which he had been an inglorious part. The feeling was dispelled by a slight movement of the group: the horse, without moving its feet, had drawn its body slightly backward from the verge; the man remained immobile as before. Broad awake and keenly alive to the significance of the situation, Druse now brought the butt of his rifle against his cheek by cautiously pushing the barrel forward through the bushes, cocked the piece, and, glancing through the <b>sights,</b> <b>covered</b> a vital spot of the horseman's breast. A touch upon the trigger and all would have been well with Carter Druse. At that instant the horseman turned his head and looked in the direction of his concealed foeman--seemed to look into his very face, into his eyes, into his brave, compassionate heart.|$|R

60|$|But Morganson {{conceived}} an idea. He {{changed his}} crouching spot {{to a place}} where cottonwood limbs projected on either side of him. Into these with his axe he chopped two broad notches. Then in one of the notches he rested the barrel of his rifle and glanced along the <b>sights.</b> He <b>covered</b> the trail thoroughly in that direction. He turned about, rested the rifle in the other notch, and, looking along the sights, swept the trail to the clump of trees behind which it disappeared.|$|R
50|$|The {{game is a}} third-person cover-based shooter. Pulling {{the left}} trigger causes the over-the-shoulder view to zoom in, {{allowing}} for more precise aiming. Clicking on the right analog stick causes the game {{to switch to a}} first-person camera, which lets the player look down the iron <b>sights.</b> Some <b>cover</b> can be partially destroyed, forcing players to seek other hiding spots. While taking cover, players can be suppressed by machine gun fire, which takes the effect of narrowing and shaking the player's field of vision, making it harder to return fire.|$|R
50|$|To fire, the gunner first {{removes the}} safety pin {{located at the}} rear of the tube, which unblocks the firing rod. He then takes a firing {{position}} ensuring that no one is present in the back blast area. If firing from the prone position, he must also place his legs well to the side to avoid burning himself. Then the gunner moves back the front and rear <b>sight</b> <b>covers,</b> allowing the <b>sights</b> to pop up into their firing positions. The AT4 has iron sights that were originally developed for the cancelled Viper, and are similar in concept and use to those on assault rifles. He then removes the first of two safeties by moving the firing rod cocking lever (located on the left side) forward and then over the top to the right side. The gunner takes aim, while at the same time holding down the red safety lever located in front of the cocking lever, and then fires by pressing forward the red firing button with his right thumb. Both the red safety lever and the firing button must be pressed down at the same time to fire the AT4. The red firing button has a similar resistance to the trigger pull of an assault rifle, so the gunner does not have to jab at the firing button, which could throw his aim off.|$|R
40|$|Type I {{planetary}} nebulae (PNe) {{are defined as}} those with high He and N abundances (Peimbert & Torres-Peimbert 1983). These objects present in general bipolar geometries and have high stellar temperatures (Corradi & Schwarz 1995, Torres-Peimbert & Peimbert 1997). In this paper we analyse the empirical methods for abundance determination in order to check if the He and N overabundances in Type I PNe are a consequence of a geometrical effect, due to the bipolarity, or the ionization stratification, due to the stellar temperature. For this, we obtain simulated spherically symmetrical as well as bipolar nebulae, using a 3 D photoionization code. From the projected emission line intensities for: a) the whole nebula; b) for a slit crossing the nebula; as well as c) for different positions in the nebula, we applied the formulae used in the literature to obtain empirical abundances. These empirical abundances are then compared with the adopted ones. We show that empirical abundances depend on the particular line of <b>sight</b> <b>covered</b> by the observation and can simulate an overabundance and/or the presence of abundance gradients of He and N in {{planetary nebulae}} with high stellar temperature. The geometrical effects are also discussed. Systematic errors in abundance determinations by empirical methods are higher for the N/H ratio than for N/O. Thus, it seems better to use the N/O value when discussing N rich objects. Comment: 19 pages, 5 figures, aastex package, to be published at Ap. ...|$|R
50|$|On 18 January 1917, Bessell-Browne became {{commander}} of the 5th Division Artillery. Two days later {{he was promoted to}} colonel and temporary brigadier general. He commanded the 5th Division Artillery at Bullecourt and Third Ypres, where he employed artillery to cover the flank. In the mobile warfare that followed the German offensive of 1918, Bessell-Browne showed himself flexible and adaptable and pioneered new tactics to provide close support for infantry. In the attack on Bellecourt, he was able to put down an accurate barrage at 90 degrees from the line of <b>sight</b> to <b>cover</b> the attack at Le Catelet. From 16 to 24 October 1918, Bessell-Browne commanded the US 30th Division's artillery, for which he was awarded the American Distinguished Service Medal.|$|R
2500|$|The prince's journey {{begins with}} an act of pity: upon {{preparing}} to cross a bridge, the hero notes that {{it is home to}} an ant colony, and, fearful of destroying it, opts instead to cross through the riverbed. An alate ant visits him and rewards his deed with one of its wings, guaranteeing that, should he ever need assistance, burning the item would instantly summon the entire colony to his aid. A similar encounter takes place after Harap Alb fashions his hat into a hive, to be used by a homeless swarm of bees: the grateful queen bee presents him with another wing, with which to summon her and her subjects. Further down on his path, Harap Alb gradually collects a band of followers. The first among them is Gerilă (from ger, [...] "frost", and the diminutive suffix -ilă), a man who shivers in summer, and whose cold breath, reaching the fury of a strong wind, can turn things into ice. Confronted with astonishment and some irony by the prince, Gerilă answers: [...] "Laugh if you will, Harap Alb, but you'll not be able to accomplish anything without me where you're going." [...] The reply prompts its recipient to change his mind, and creates a bond between the two characters. They are joined by Flămânzilă (from flămând, [...] "hungry"; translated as [...] "Eat-All"), who can consume huge amounts without satisfying his appetite. Next comes Setilă (from sete, [...] "thirst"; also [...] "Drink-All"), Flămânzilă's counterpart among drinkers. These in turn are followed by Ochilă (from ochi, [...] "eye"), whose <b>sight</b> <b>covers</b> immense distances, and Păsări-Lăți-Lungilă (from pasăre, [...] "bird", a se lăți, [...] "to widen oneself" [...] and a se lungi, [...] "to lengthen oneself"), who can will himself to grow in any direction and reach heights only accessible to birds. They all persuade Harap Alb to discard his reticence by issuing forecasts closely resembling Gerilă's reply. The first effect of this reunion is however disastrous: the respective traits of the characters result in burning down entire forests, depleting the soil, draining the water, exposing all secrets and exterminating birds, with Harap Alb himself being the only one who [...] "did not cause any disruption." ...|$|R

5000|$|For {{the medium}} machine gun role a large tripod, the Lafette 42, was {{available}} {{that included a}} number of features, such as recoil absorbing buffer springs, MG Z 34 or MG Z 40 periscope-type telescopic sight containing special sighting equipment for indirect fire, or the late World War II MG Z 44, designed for direct fire only. An accessory to lengthen these sights' periscope was available to use these <b>sights</b> behind <b>cover.</b> It could be {{set up in a}} prone, kneeling or high position. The Lafette 42 weighed 20.5 kg on its own and was a simplified version of the Lafette 34 used for the MG 34, as the MG 42 could be operated more easily from a Lafette and featured no semi-automatic firing mode. The legs could be extended with a Lafetteaufsatzstück to allow it {{to be used in the}} anti-aircraft role, and when lowered, it could be placed to allow the gun to be fired [...] "remotely" [...] while it swept an arc in front of the mounting with fire. Mounted to the Lafette and aimed through the telescopic sight, the effective range of the MG 42 could be extended out to 3500 m when fired indirectly.|$|R
