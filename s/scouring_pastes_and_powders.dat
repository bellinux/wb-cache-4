The materials {{used in the present}} invention are different granulation silver powders. The grain size analysis were used in order to determine their size. The transmission line model (TLM) patterns were fabricated by selective laser sintering. Findings: This work presents an initial analysis of a new selective laser sintering/melting process to contact crystalline silicon solar cells. The seed layer was created using both silver <b>pastes</b> <b>and</b> <b>powders</b> by a selective laser sintering, do not use up to now in Poland. These contact structures were investigated microscopically {{to gain a better understanding}} of the method and select laser micro-machining parameters, which will influence on electrical parameters of formed front side grids. Practical implications: SLS can produce parts from a relatively wide range of commercially available powder materials. The physical process can be full melting, partial melting, or liquid-phase sintering and depending on the material. The thickness of silicon solar wafer can cause some difficulties connected with adhesion electrode during contact formation process.

40|$|Mustard (Brassica spp.), {{a native}} to {{temperate}} regions of Europe, {{was one of}} the first domesticated crops. This crop's economic value resulted in its wide dispersal and it has been grown as a herb in Asia, North Africa, and Europe for thousands of years. Ancient Greeks and Romans enjoyed mustard (sinapis) seed as a <b>paste</b> <b>and</b> <b>powder.</b> In about 1300, the name "mustard " was given to the condiment made by mixing mustum, which is the Latin word for unfermented grape juice, with ground mustard seeds. Mustard has been a major specialty crop in North America since supplies from western Europe were interrupted by World War II. California and Montana were the major production areas until the early 1950 s. Production of mustard in the Upper Midwest began in the early 1960 s. Mustard is currently grown on approximately 250, 000 acres annually in the United States. North Dakota has the largest share of domestic production. Canadian mustard production increased for twenty years until it peaked in the mid- 1980 s. Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan currently grow a large share of the world's mustard crop. The French people are the largest consumers of mustard (1. 5 lbs/person/year), and buy approximately 70 % of the annual Canadian production. Three types of mustard, yellow, brown, and oriental, are grown in North America. Yellow mustard (Brassica hirta) comprises about 90 % of the crop in Montana. In Europe, yellow mustard is also known as white mustard (Sinapis alba- an older botanical name). The Crop Profile/PMSP database, including this document, is supported by USDA NIFA. Brown and oriental mustards (Brassica juncea) are grown on limited acres. This crop is commonly produced in a rotation with small grains...|$|R

Methods. In this experiment, amoxicillin, triple antibiotic <b>paste</b> <b>and</b> nanosilver <b>powder</b> were added at 10 % of the total sealer weight to AH 26 and AH Plus sealers and then cultured freshly or after 1, 3, and 7 days with suspension of E. faecalis for 24 hours.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{production}} of complex components {{with little or}} no machining by powder metallurgy (PM) techniques has brought in injection moulding {{as one of the most}} popular processing techniques. The tools and dies required for injection moulding are themselves complex and in order to process these, the technology of rapid prototyping (RP) or solid free-form fabrication (SFF) etc. has come into vogue. Essentially, a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of the required free-form is created and converted into STL (after the process Stereo Lithography for which 3 D systems developed this format) format. The latter is sliced into thin cross-sectional layers and the output is fed to the rapid prototyping machine which then builds the free-form, one layer atop another. The free-form is then sintered to yield the final product. During the past decade, RP has evolved into a class of technologies such as stereo-lithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), solid ground curing (SGC), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), fused deposition modelling (FDM), inkjet printing, etc. Not only can solid free forms be fabricated using these techniques, but functionally gradient materials (FGM) with properties varying from the surface to the interior, as well as composite materials, can also be advantageously made. The RP techniques are extensively used in processing ceramics and ceramic-polymer composites. The most popular techniques for metal <b>powders</b> are FDM <b>and</b> SLS. The latter often uses metal powders along with polymers. Complex shapes such as gears, turbine blades, etc. are produced. The technology however is in the early stages as far as Powder Metallurgy applications are concerned.

The changes in dentine morphology were evaluated by SEM. Study design: Commercial prophylactic <b>pastes</b> <b>and</b> air-polishing <b>powders</b> were tested in this study. Dentine discs from human third molars were used to study the quantitative reduction of the dentine permeability under simulated pulpal pressure (20 cm H 2 O). Further specimens were gold-coated and analysed using observed a SEM. Results: The results of this study showed different dentine permeability redaction based on the type of product employed (i. e. prophylactic paste or air-polishing powders). The use of Sylc bioactive glass and sodium bicarbonate were the most effective in reducing dentine permeability of the specimens. However, the air-polishing procedures performed with Sylc bioactive glass created a dentine surface devoid of exposed dentinal tubules due to the presence of a compact multilayered smear layer. Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief and Nupro NU-Solution reduced the dentine permeability up to 69. 8 % and 66. 9 % respectively.
