Este estudo comparou diferentes métodos de preparação do úbere, incluindo a participação do bezerro para estimular a descida do leite, em relação à contaminação microbiana da pele da teta. Um experimento com 36 vacas ordenhadas mecanicamente foi conduzido para comparar três procedimentos (A, B, C) de preparação do úbere. Duas tetas de cada vaca foram amostradas para contagem total de bactérias (CTB) e de coliformes, antes e após lavagem com água e secagem com papel toalha descartável (A); procedimento A, mais imersão das tetas em solução de iodo (4. 000 ppm) e secagem com papel toalha descartável (B); higienização com toalha de papel embebida em solução desinfetante contendo clorexidina (C). O segundo experimento incluiu 16 vacas ordenhadas manualmente, na presença do bezerro. Permitiu-se a cada bezerro mamar as quatro tetas por alguns segundos, de acordo com o manejo do rebanho. Amostras para bacteriologia de duas tetas de cada vaca foram coletadas, antes, após a mamada do bezerro, e após higienização semelhante ao procedimento C, citado acima. Os tratamentos foram analisados usando-se o teste não- paramétrico de Kruskal-Wallis, considerando-se os dados de tCTB após o uso de um dos métodos de preparação do úbere ou da mamada do bezerro. Usou-se a transformação das contagens bacterianas para a escala logarítmica em base 10, com a fórmula tCTB=log 10 (CTB+ 0, 5). Para os grupos A, B e C (primeiro experimento), os valores médios de diminuição de tCTB foram 1, 8, 2, 2 e 2, 4, respectivamente. No segundo experimento, as CTB's aumentaram significativamente (P The teat skin {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{microbial}} contamination of raw milk as well as a source of mastitis infection. This study assessed the microbial load of the teat skin following the application of the different practices for preparing the udder, including the use of calf suckling to stimulate the letdown of milk. Thirty-six cows milked by machine were included in one experiment. Two teats of each cow were sampled for bacteriology before and after using one of three methods of udder preparation, as follows: rinsing with water and drying with single paper towels (A); method A plus pre-dipping with an iodine teat dip (4, 000 ppm) and drying with single paper towels (B); wiping teats using a commercial wet non-woven wipe pre-soaked with a solution containing chlorexidine (C). The second experiment included 16 cows milked by hand. The calf of each cow was allowed to suck the four teats for a few seconds, and then two teats per cow were sampled for bacteriology. Samples were collected before, after <b>calf</b> <b>sucking</b> and following teat pre-milking treatment (as for group C, above). Statistical analysis was conducted on transformed (log 10) data with tTBC=log 10 (TBC+ 0. 5) using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Each treatment was analysed considering the difference in tTBC after the use of either method of preparation of the udder or <b>calf</b> <b>sucking.</b> For groups A, B and C (first experiment), tTBC values were reduced 1. 8, 2. 2 and 2. 4, respectively. In the second experiment, tTBC increased significantly (P< 0, 05) after <b>calf</b> <b>sucking</b> (from 3. 2 to 4. 3). After disinfection the tTBC was significantly reduced to 2. 0. These results show that: (a) teat rinsing with water and wiping dry reduces the number of microorganisms on the teat skin, but the reduction is significantly higher when teats are disinfected; (b) <b>calf</b> <b>sucking</b> before milking increases significantly the number of microorganisms on teat skin; (c) the number of microorganisms on teat skin can be reduced more than 10 times after <b>calf</b> <b>sucking</b> if teats are disinfected. Very low numbers or no growth of coliforms were observed in all cases...|$|R
50|$|Porpoises {{are fully}} aquatic creatures. Females deliver a single calf after a {{gestation}} period lasting about a year. Calving takes place entirely under water, with the foetus positioned for tail-first delivery {{to help prevent}} drowning. Females have mammary glands, but {{the shape of a}} newborn calf's mouth does not allow it to obtain a seal around the nipple— instead of the <b>calf</b> <b>sucking</b> milk, the mother squirts milk into the calf's mouth. This milk contains high amounts of fat, which aids in the development of blubber; it contains so much fat that it has the consistency of toothpaste. The calves are weaned at about 11 months of age. Males play no part in rearing calves. The calf is dependent for one to two years, and maturity occurs after seven to ten years, all varying between species. This mode of reproduction produces few offspring, but increases the probability of each one surviving.|$|R
40|$|We used four surveys {{to collect}} {{information}} about the birth, physical growth, and behavioral development of 12 African elephant calves born in captivity. The management of the birth process and neonatal care involved a variety of standard procedures. All of the calves were born at night, between 7 PM and 7 AM. The calves showed a systematic progression in behavioral and physical development, attaining developmental milestones at least a quickly as calves in situ. This study emphasized birth-related events, changes {{in the ways that}} calves used their trunks, first instances of behaviors, and interactions of the calves with other, usually adult, elephants. Several behaviors, such as the dam covering her calf with hay and the <b>calf</b> <b>sucking</b> its own trunk, were common in the captive situation and have been observed in situ. Overall, the behaviors of the calves resembled those observed for African elephant calves in situ. These data should help in the management of African elephants under human care by providing systematic reference values for the birth and development of elephant calves...|$|R

He sheathed his sword, took up his cloak and hat, made those gentlemen the compliments that became the occasion, in terms a trifle more brief, perhaps, than were usual, and, still wondering why Monsieur de Gaubert had not yet returned, he stalked briskly away.

40|$|A 2 -year {{longitudinal}} {{survey was}} carried out to investigate factors affecting milk yield in crossbred cows on smallholder farms in and around an urban centre. Sixty farms were visited at approximately 2 -week intervals and details of milk yield, body condition score (BCS) and heart girth measurements were collected. Fifteen farms were within the town (U), 23 farms were approximately 5 km from town (SU), and 22 farms approximately 10 km from town (PU). Sources of variation in milk yield were investigated using a general linear model by a stepwise forward selection and backward elimination approach to judge important independent variables. Factors considered for {{the first step of}} formulation of the model included location (PU, SU and U), calving season, BCS at calving, at 3 months postpartum and at 6 months postpartum, calving year, herd size category, source of labour (hired and family labour), calf rearing method (bucket and partial suckling) and parity number of the cow. Daily milk yield (including milk sucked by calves) was determined by calving year (p < 0. 0001), calf rearing method (p = 0. 044) and BCS at calving (p < 0. 0001). Only BCS at calving contributed to variation in volume of milk <b>sucked</b> by the <b>calf,</b> lactation length and lactation milk yield. BCS at 3 months after calving was improved on farms where labour was hired (p = 0. 041) and BCS change from calving to 6 months was {{more than twice as likely}} to be negative on U than SU and PU farms. It was concluded that milk production was predominantly associated with BCS at calving, lactation milk yield increasing quadratically from score 1 to 3. BCS at calving may provide a simple, single indicator of the nutritional status of a cow population...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{determined}} the effect of suckling of the calf restricted to once a day per 30 min plus a combined hormonal treatment on the postpartum anestrous period and fertility in beef cows after 120 days postpartum. About 67 Bos taurus x Bos indicus crossbred multiparous pregnant cows were used and randomly distributed to five treatments: traditional suckling (TS; n = 15), calf stayed all day with the dam; restricted suckling (RS; n = 14), <b>calf</b> <b>sucked</b> the cow once a day per 30 min beginning day 7 postpartum; TS plus a combined hormonal treatment (TSH; n = 15), applied at day 50 postpartum, consisting in GnRH+Norgestomet for 7 days+PGF 2 α (day 0) +GnRH (day 2); RS plus hormonal treatment (RSH; n = 16) as described in group 3 and without suckling (WS; n = 7) which included cows with death calves before day 7 postpartum. There was an increase (p≥ 0. 001) in the ovarian activity of cows in the RS and RSH treatment compared to TS and TSH group cows (78. 6 and 87. 5 vs. 26. 7 and 46. 7 %, respectively). Calving-first ovulation interval for WS cows was shorter (p≤ 0. 001) than intervals for RSH, RS, TSH and TS cows (22. 3 vs. 49. 3, 68. 8, 63. 5 and 86. 3 days, respectively). Likewise, the calving-first ovulation interval was shorter for RSH (p≤ 0. 01) vs. TSH and TS. Cows in RS and RSH treatments were more fertile (p≤ 0. 001) than those from TS and TSH groups (42. 3 and 56. 3 vs. 20. 0 and 6. 6 %, respectively). The WS cows (71. 4 %) had higher fertility (p≤ 0. 001) than cows from all other combined treatments (31. 6 %). No differences were found between treatments (p> 0. 05) regarding the incidence of corpora lutea of short half-life. In conclusion, suckling restricted to 30 min reduced the resumption period of ovarian activity in beef cows in the tropics of Mexico. Double dose of GnRH plus Norgestomet and PGF 2 α induced fertile ovulations after 50 days postpartum in restricted suckling cows...|$|R

For the rest he had taken the precaution of leaving Rabecque at the <b>Sucking</b> <b>Calf,</b> and he had given the sergeant strict injunctions that he was not to allow any of his men to leave their posts during his absence, and that the troopers were to hold themselves entirely at the orders of Rabecque.

Foi mensurada a concentração de imunoglobulina G (IgG) de amostras de sangue de 21 bezerros, colhidas às 48 horas de vida. Os testes utilizados para mensurar a concentração de IgG foram: imunodifusão radial, refratometria e coagulação por glutaraldeído. A densidade do colostro fornecido aos animais foi mensurada com lactodensímetro. Nos animais submetidos ao tratamento 3, foi detectada maior transferência IgG que naqueles submetidos aos tratamentos 1 e 2 que, por sua vez, apresentaram maior aquisição de imunidade passiva que os animais do tratamento 4.

40|$|Neonatal calves {{form the}} basis of all dairy and beef herds. There are many factors that {{influence}} calf survival and welfare and therefore the economic viability of the farm. This thesis examines four factors that have the potential to affect the survival and welfare of neonatal calves. 1. Induction of premature parturition in dairy cows results in the birth of calves that have a higher mortality rate than those born at full-term. The mortality rate of these calves decreases as their gestational age approaches full-term. The aims of the study described in chapter two were to assess the physical and physiological state of calves born at varying gestational ages. Sixty-eight induced calves that were born up to five weeks prematurely were examined and the following observations and measurements were recorded: body weight, crown rump length, rectal temperature, the number of deciduous incisors erupted and palpable, breathing rate, heart rate, gum colour, hoof membranes, serum gamma glutamyl transferase activity and a general assessment of coordination. It was found that calves born prematurely had lighter body weights, shorter crown rump lengths, lower rectal temperatures, fewer deciduous incisor teeth erupted and that they breathe more slowly. It was concluded that welfare of calves born more than 3 weeks prematurely (< 259 days gestational age) were more likely to die or become ill because of a reduced ability to maintain their body temperature and difficulty breathing and feeding effectively. 2. Although many premature calves die on the farm a few are kept for rearing and the remainder are sent for slaughter. While the calves remain on the farm their welfare and survival depends on them being fed colostrum or milk at appropriate volumes and intervals. Calves that are sent for slaughter may go without food for up to 30 hours. Although the metabolic responses of full-term calves to feeding and fasting have been examined those of premature calves have not. In chapter three the responses of premature calves to different feeding frequencies (100 - 120 ml colostrum /kg body weight split into either 2 or 4 feeds of equal volume over ten hour period) and to 30 hours fasting were examined. The calves were either four or ten days old {{at the start of the}} experiment and varied in gestational age at birth. The effects of feeding frequency and fasting were assessed using the changes in plasma glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate, triglycerides, urea, total plasma protein concentration, packed cell volume and the rectal temperature. It was found that premature calves tended to have lower plasma glucose and higher β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations than those born at full term indicating a greater dependence on lipids to provide their energetic requirements. The wide variation in these parameters was primarily determined by the gestational age of the calves at birth. Calves born further from full-term apparently depend on lipid catabolism to a greater degree. The premature calves gained no apparent energetic advantage when fed a similar volume of milk in four feeds as compared with twice within ten hours. There was considerable variation in the ability of the calves to tolerate 30 hours of fasting. The availability of energy in fasted calves (as indicated by plasma glucose concentration) was greater in those fed 50 ml colostrum/kg bodyweight rather than 25 ml/kg at the onset of fasting. Calves born at an earlier gestational age had a reduced ability to tolerate 30 hours without food. A decrease in rectal temperature during fasting was seen in some of the more premature calves. This period of fasting did not cause dehydration as indicated by the absence of significant increases in packed cell volume or total plasma protein concentration. The calves' postnatal age did not affect their responses to either feeding frequency or fasting. 3. The fetal membranes of twin calves often fuse where they abut resulting in varying degrees of placental vascular anastomosis. The gross anatomy of placentas from 18 twin-bearing cows, and the PCV changes of their calves between birth and 24 hours were examined. Six classes of vascular anastomosis were identified. The extent of anastomosis varied from none, to extensive. The PCV decrease over the 24 hours following birth differed to a greater extent between twins from placentas exhibiting a high degree of anastomosis. It was concluded that these differences were likely to have been due to blood transfer within the joined placental vessels of the calves during birth. 4. The intake of colostral immunoglobulins gives neonatal calves the ability to resist disease. However, the capacity to absorb immunoglobulins decreases rapidly between 6 and 24 hours after birth. In the study described in chapter five it was found that failure of passive transfer of immunoglobulins, as indicated by low gamma glutamyl transferase activity, occurred in approximately 45 % of the 74 dairy calves from which blood samples were taken. Calves that had not received colostrum were not easily distinguished from those that had on the basis of obvious physical or behavioural features. The behaviour of 21 cows and their calves was observed between birth and the time the calves were separated from their dams. The amount of time the calves spent with their dams ranged from 74 minutes to 1492. Thirty-three percent of calves had not sucked within this time. Of those calves that did suck, 79 % did so within 6 hours of their birth. There were no obvious behaviours on the part of the cows or their calves that influenced the time between birth and first sucking or the amount of time spent <b>sucking</b> by each <b>calf...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} housing of {{veal calves}} in individual crates without roughage has received prolonged and serious criticism, since it denies the animals various social activities, {{freedom of movement}} and the possibility to consume roughage and to ruminate. In order to develop an economically acceptable alternative to this housing system, which would provide a significant improvement in calf welfare, the housing of calves in groups of five was evaluated with regards to husbandry, health and ethological aspects. The present study focussed mainly on the behaviour of the calves in individual crates and group pens (chapter IV) {{and it was only}} casually concerned with the production and health of the animals (chapter III). A major problem in the group pens was the occurrence of preputial sucking and urine drinking, which had a negative influence on production, health and behaviour. The development of these activities was described (chapter V) and several experiments concerning their prevention were presented (chapter VI). The influence on lying behaviour of the tethering of the calves during the first 6 - 8 weeks after arrival - as a preventive measure against preputial sucking and urine drinking - was studied in chapter VII. Finally, restrictions to particular lying postures in the crates were investigated with respect to their effect on sleep (chapter VIII). In five consecutive experiments, a total of 94 calves were housed in individual crates (1, 65 x 0, 65 m) and provided with 100 g straw/calf/day. whereas 99 calves were kept in groups of five in pens (2, 20 x 3, 83 m) on concrete slatted floors with straw bedding and an ad libitum supply of straw in baskets. The group housed calves were not tethered during the first weeks after arrival. In four other experiments, a total of 47 calves were housed in individual crates (1, 70 x 0, 70 m) and given 200 g straw cobs/calf/day from week 7 or 9 onwards, whereas 139 calves were kept in groups of five in pens (2, 40 x 3, 05 m) on wooden (and in some pens partly concrete) slatted floors. 1 kg straw cobs was supplied daily from week 7 or 9 onwards in one trough per group pen. During the first 6 weeks after arrival, the calves were tethered to the feeding gate, separated individually by partitions. All calves were male and predominantly black and white (FH x HF). In three out of the nine experiments, male red and white (MRY) calves were used. The influence of this breed difference was not discussed. The calves were fed a milk replacer in open buckets twice daily at approximately 8. 00 and 16. 00 h. In chapter III, limited data on production, health and labour requirements of the calves in these housing systems are reported, which provide a first impression on how individual crates and group pens compare. Growth rate (about 1200 g /day) and feed conversion (about 1, 5) of the calves slaughtered at a normal weight in group pens with and without straw bedding {{on the one hand and}} individual crates on the other were comparable and quite favourable. Slaughter quality, which was satisfactory in general, was also similar in these different housing systems. Haemoglobin levels at slaughter were fairly high (8 - 110 g/ 100 ml), but meat colour was still acceptable. A relatively large number of group housed calves, however, died or had to be culled or eliminated. The total of these losses amounted to 10, 1 % in the group pens with straw bedding, against 4, 3 % in the corresponding crates; in the group pens with slatted floors the total losses were 9, 4 % against 2, 2 % in the crates. These high losses in the group pens mainly occurred because in this housing system it was difficult to treat diseased calves individually (for example by supplying a medicinated milk replacer) since they were often pushed away by penmates. When disregarding these losses, the health status of the calves, as measured by the frequency and duration of the different medical treatments imposed,seemed no worse in the group pens than in the individual crates. In the group pens, the provision of 23, 3 kg strawlcalf for feeding and 106, 3 kg straw/ calf for bedding took 138, 7 min/calf in total during the entire fattening period, against 32, 6 min/calf for supplying 7, 1 kg straw/calf in the individual crates. In the group pens with bare slatted floors and the corresponding crates, the total amount of straw cobs provided from week 9 onwards (13 - 14 kg/calf) and the time required to do this (15 - 17 min/calf) were about equal. In the first series of experiments, when the calves were tethered for the first 6 weeks after arrival, preputial sucking did not occur. The muzzling of preputial suckers was not satisfactory, since it obstructed smelling, licking and the intake of straw and moreover, it did not stop the ingestion of urine. Abomasal lesions (erosions, ulcers, scars), which were mainly located in the pyloric region, were observed in calves housed in individual crates and group pens alike. In only 14 - 37 % of the animals, the abomasums were not affected by lesions. It was concluded that group housing with or without straw bedding is not incompatible with fast growth, favourable feed conversion and adequate slaughter quality. The high losses in the group pens may perhaps be reduced by restraining the calves at feeding with a self- yoking feeding gate, which facilitates not only the treatment of illnesses but also their detection. The latter seems particularly valuable on practical farms, when health inspection is not as intensive as in the present study. The supply and removal of straw as a bedding is extremely labour intensive and therefore wooden slatted floors without straw are preferred in further research. The study of the causation and prevention of preputial sucking and urine drinking has a high priority, since preventive tethering restricts freedom of movement, social contact and exploratory behaviour. In chapter IV, it was investigated to what extent calves in individual crates were restricted in their behaviour in comparison to calves in group pens and how they dealt with their situation. For this purpose, the behaviour of the same calves whose production characteristics were described in the previous chapter was registered. Observations were carried out on all individual calves in both housing systems over one period of 23 hours (24 hours with exception of feeding periods) in weeks 8, 12, 16 and 20 after arrival by means of instantaneous sampling in 10 minute intervals. Subsequently, an analysis of variance was executed to calculate the average frequency and trend for each behaviour and both housing systems were compared on the basis of these parameters. The percentages quoted are close approximations of average values over the second series of four experiments (with group pens on slatted floors without straw bedding and the corresponding crates). The calves in the crates spent more time lying than those in the group pens (74 against 68 %). This is probably above all the result of a greater variety of stimuli in the group pens, but occasional mounting and treading of penmates may also have contributed to this difference. Lying on the side or on the brisket with both hindlegs stretched in the group pens amounted to 2 and 8 % of total lying time respectively. Lying was severely restricted by the sidewalls of the crates and consequently, these postures only rarely occurred in the crates at the end of the fattening period. It is argued that these restrictions may interfere with the relaxation of the body. Moreover, these limitations seemed to affect behavioural thermoregulation; the crated calves regulated heat loss by stretching their forelegs forwards during lying (27 % of total lying) or by bending them under the body, whereas the group housed calves increased or decreased body. contact with the floor often by stretching and bending their hindlegs instead of their forelegs (hindlegs stretched: 10 % of total lying; forelegs stretched: 15, 5 % of total lying). Lying with the head turned backwards, which is the usual posture for supporting the head (in the group pens 20 - 25 % of total lying) became increasingly restricted in the individual crates towards the end of the fattening period. In the crates, the duration of this lying posture as a proportion of total lying decreased from 25 % in week 8 to 5 % in week 20. Although the head was supported forwards on the floor more often (10 % instead of 5 % of total lying) or against the partitions (1 - 2 % of total lying), the duration of lying with the head supported was clearly reduced in the crates in comparison to the group pens: 16 % and 30 % respectively. The latter percentage includes lying with the head on penmates in the group pens (5 % of total lying). Since supporting the head is necessary for the relaxation of the neck muscles during certain states of sleep, the restriction of these tying postures in the crates may interfere with sleep as a physiological process. Furthermore, the licking of the belly, back, thighs or hindlegs (1, 7 % in the crates and 3, 2 % in the group pens) and the scratching of the head, neck or shoulders (0, 05 against 0, 16 %) were also hindered by the sidewalls of the crate, whereas rubbing (0, 6 - 0, 7 %) was not impaired. On the other hand, the licking of the forelegs (1, 0 against 0, 7 %) and the muzzle (1, 9 against 1, 1 %), which are easily accessible, was more frequently performed by the crated calves than by the group housed ones. The increase of the latter activities in the individual crates may be related to conflict situations. Self stretching was reduced in the crates as compared to the group pens (0, 14 against 0, 25 %). In the individual crates, physical interactions between neighbouring calves were usually limited to licking and sucking at feeding times when the front was opened, whereas in the group pens mutual licking occurred regularly throughout the day (2, 5 %) and head butting and mounting (together 1, 0 %) were also performed. Preputial sucking and urine drinking were seldom in this period from 8 to 20 weeks after arrival (together less than 0, 3 %). Occasional licking outside feeding periods was observed in the crates as soon as the calves were able to reach over the sidewalls, which shows their desire for social contacts. Head butting against inanimate objects and jumping as an introduction to play were more frequent in the individual crates than in the group pens (together 0, 4 % against 0, 2 %), which may indicate a need for social play in the individually housed animals. Exploration by the crated calves was confined to the licking and sniffing at the front part of the crates and the surveying of the area in front of and behind the crates. As a consequence of the limited (visual) contact with the environment, the calves in the crates were quickly alarmed, in contrast to those in the group pens, which could survey the environment even when lying. Eating and ruminating were clearly enhanced in the group pens with straw bedding and ad libitum straw for feeding (7 and 22 % respectively) as compared to the group pens with slatted floors and a limited supply of straw cobs (1, 5 and 9, 5 % respectively) or the individual crates with small gifts of straw or straw cobs (1 - 2 % and 8 - 12 % respectively). The performance of stereotypies such as the licking (4 - 5 %) or scraping (2 - 3 %) of objects and tongue playing (2 %) was not affected by individual or group housing as such, but these activities were somewhat reduced when straw supply was ad libitum instead of restricted. Wooden slatted floors were slippery and uneven in comparison to concrete slatted floors with straw bedding although this probably did not interfere with the mobility of the calves, for instance during head butting and mounting. As a first step in finding ways of preventing preputial sucking and urine drinking, it is described in chapter V how the orientation of sucking behaviour develops in calves which are loose housed in groups of five upon arrival. Initially, sucking was orientated towards physical objects or body parts of congeners other than the prepuce. Most calves preferred a certain body part or (more seldom) a physical object for sucking, such as the ears, mouth, legs or scrotum of penmates, the rim of a bucket or a horizontal bar. These preferences differed among individual calves and usually changed over time. In the second and third week after arrival, many calves showed a preference for sucking at the prepuce of congeners. In reaction, the sucked calf usually started to urinate, while the <b>sucking</b> <b>calf</b> held on to the prepuce and ingested most of the urine. This preputial sucking was observed in the first 6 - 8 weeks after arrival; thereafter, the frequency of this behaviour and of the other sucking activities was strongly reduced in all calves. Seven out of the 30 calves in this study never sucked the prepuce and two only seldom. In most calves, preputial sucking took up several hours per day, whereas sucking at physical objects or other body parts lasted one hour per day at most. Moreover, preputial sucking occurred during several activity periods throughout the day and night, whereas other sucking was concentrated at feeding times. Individual preferences or aversions for sucking at the prepuce of particular penmates were uncommon. Persistent preputial sucking resulted in the loss of hair around the muzzle and cases of poor growth among the sucking calves, whereas hairloss of the prepuce and avoidance reactions occurred among the calves which were sucked. Urine drinking, the licking of the urine jet of a urinating calf, was relatively harmless and infrequent; it was performed by preputial suckers as well as non-preputial suckers. On the basis of this information, two hypotheses were proposed. The first one implicated that the attraction of preputial sucking as compared to other sucking was connected to the intake of urine during this activity. The second one suggested that the absence of preputial sucking in some calves had to do with their early sucking experience. Both hypotheses were tested in chapter VI. In a pilot study (chapter VI. 1), several sucking and drinking devices were presented in different combinations to calves in group pens which had been fed during the first day of their life either with open buckets, with teat buckets or by the mother cow. All calves were fed a milk replacer in open buckets twice daily. The drinking and sucking behaviour of the calves was registered during one 24 hour period in weeks 2, 3 and 4 after arrival. Teats connected to a water reservoir were sucked more than empty teats, which suggests that the release of fluid from the sucked object is an incentive in sucking. This indirectly supports the idea that the excretion of urine stimulates preputial sucking. Furthermore, 11 out of 22 open bucket reared calves and 2 out of 10 cow reared calves started preputial sucking, whereas all 8 teat bucket reared calves refrained from this activity, which tentatively shows that early sucking experience may influence the frequency of preputial sucking. Next (chapter VI. 2), it is argued that the provision of only small amounts of milk replacer during the first weeks of the fattening period (3 - 4 l/calf/day) may lead to a fluid deficit which may be one of the causes of preputial sucking. Therefore, the effect of extra water supply on the incidence of preputial sucking was investigated. In three replicate experiments, 3 - 5 l water (25 - 35 °C) was provided two or three times per day in open buckets to a total of 60 calves in groups of five, whereas 60 other group housed calves did not receive extra water. Total fluid intake (milk replacer + water) was on average two to three times higher in the extra water groups than in the control groups of calves (for instance in week 3 : 14 l against 5 l/calf/day). Nevertheless, in extra water groups 10 calves started preputial sucking against 14 calves in the groups without extra water; there was no significant influence of an extra supply of water on the incidence of preputial sucking. In one of the three replicates, drinking intensity of all individual calves was measured every two days by recording latency till drinking and drinking rate in separate "drinking tests". Surprisingly, the drinking intensity of calves provided with extra water was no less than that of calves without extra water. Moreover, those calves which drank the maximum of 15 l of water daily showed the highest drinking intensity. This raises some interesting questions concerning water intake regulation in these young calves. In the last section (chapter VI. 3), it was investigated if early sucking experience indeed affected the development of preputial sucking as suggested by earlier data. In the first experiment 20 bucket reared, 15 teat bucket reared and 5 cow reared calves were kept in groups of five and fed twice daily from open buckets. 13 out of 20 bucket reared calves and three out of five cow reared calves started preputial sucking, whereas again none of the 15 teat bucket reared calves engaged in this behaviour. The difference between bucket and teat bucket reared calves was significant (p(one-tailed) = 0, 028). In the second experiment, eight bucket reared and nine teat bucket reared calves were observed, but preputial sucking did not occur. In this experiment, the contacting and sucking of a teat was studied by presenting a non-nutritive teat to each calf individually for 5 minute periods, six times a day. Four out of eight bucket reared calves usually failed to suck the teat, whereas all nine teat bucket reared ones nearly always attached to the teat and sucked. The average duration of sucking of those calves which contacted the teat was similar in both groups. The fact that in three experiments none out of a total of 32 teat bucket reared calves engaged in preputial sucking, compared to 24 out of 50 bucket reared and 5 out of 15 cow reared calves, strongly suggests that early sucking experience influences the development of preputial sucking. Furthermore, the failure of some of the bucket reared calves to attach to the teat may indicate that such calves are less likely to find the teats of an automatic feed dispenser on their own as compared to teat bucket reared calves. The practical consequences of these findings should be investigated further with a larger number of animals. Although the previous results advanced the understanding of how preputial sucking develops and what factors are involved in its causation, they did not provide an instant method for preventing this unwanted behaviour. Since at present, tethering the calves and separating them by small partitions during the first 6 - 8 weeks after arrival seems the only effective and practical way to avoid preputial sucking, different tethering methods were evaluated regarding their consequences for calf behaviour (chapter VII). Stalls (i. e. spaces where single calves were tethered between partitions) of 0, 48 m and 0, 58 m in width were equipped with either 0, 48 m long chains with contraweights (0, 2 kg) which were guided through openings in the feeding gate or fixed chains of medium length (0, 40 m); in a second experiment, the long chains with contraweights were replaced by short fixed chains (0, 34 m). Different lying postures and patterns of standing up and lying down were recorded, mainly from 6 to 9 weeks after arrival, just before the calves were untethered. The tethering of calves in 0, 48 m wide stalls restricted lying on the side or on the brisket with the hindlegs stretched at 6 and 8 weeks to about the same extent as housing in 0, 70 m wide crates at 8 weeks; in 0, 58 m wide stalls, both lying postures were hindered less. The stretching of the forelegs in these different types of stalls was not impaired. Stalls of 0, 48 m in width restricted the lying with the head turned backwards in contrast to stalls of 0, 58 m in width, but these restrictions were not serious. The use of chains of 0, 34 m in length and chains provided with contraweights to prevent entanglement of the forelegs was unnecessary and moreover, it hindered the turning of the head backwards during lying; these chains should not be used. In all tethering stalls, the space in front of the calves was insufficient to swing the head forwards freely when standing up. Casual contacts with the partitions or restrictions by the chains were of minor importance, since they did not really interfere with standing up and lying down. In general, standing up and lying down occurred without great difficulty, but the calves' performance deteriorated in cold conditions. Moreover, at temperatures below approximately 8 °C, which is the lower critical value for veal calves of 4 - 10 weeks of age, they experienced discomfort, as appeared from the shivering of the animals and extreme postural changes including the tucking in of all legs and the burying of the head in the flank. Therefore, such low temperatures are clearly disagreeable. The support of the head while lying, which is necessary for the relaxation of the neck muscles during paradoxical sleep (PS), was diminished in the individual crates as a result of restrictions to lying with the head turned backwards. The consequences of this impairment for the performance of PS in calves of about one week old were examined in chapter VIII. Lying with the head turned backwards was obstructed for 24 hours by the use of a short halter and the performance of PS was measured before, during and after this obst...|$|E
