40|$|Abstract. Fourier {{analysis}} of two spectroscopic time series obtained with the IUE observatory {{confirm that the}} ultraviolet stellar wind profiles of HD 64760 (B 0. 5 Ib) are periodically variable.

The circular polarization is interpreted as high-harmonic optical cyclotron emission from an accreting, magnetic white dwarf primary. However, the dominant system light and photometric variability are due to the heated companion star. In this picture, the prenova system was a synchronized AM Herculis-type magnetic variable.
