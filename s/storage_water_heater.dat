Conventional storage water heaters use a variety of fuels, including natural gas, propane, fuel oil, and electricity.

Conventional storage water heaters are the most common water heating type used in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Startup costs: Beyond the 2x-4x larger initial {{purchase}} price (as {{compared to a}} tanked water heater), installing a tankless system comes at an increased cost, particularly in retrofit applications. They tend to be particularly expensive {{in areas such as}} the US where they are not dominant, compared to the established tank design. If a <b>storage</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> is replaced with a tankless one, the installer may have to increase the size of the electrical wiring or gas pipeline to handle the load, and replace the existing vent pipe—possibly adding expense to the retrofit. Many tankless units have fully modulating gas valves that range from as low as 10,000 to over 1,000,000 BTUs. Most electrical installations require AWG 10 or 8 wire, corresponding to 5.5 or 8.5 mm2 for typical POU (point of use) heaters at North American voltages. Larger whole-house electric units may require up to AWG 2 wire. In gas appliances, both pressure and volume requirements must be met for optimum operation.|$|E

5000|$|Under the 2015 standard, for {{the first}} time, storage water heaters with {{capacities}} of 55 US gallons or larger now face stricter efficiency requirements than those of 50 US gallons or less. Under the pre-2015 standard, a 75 gal gas <b>storage</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> with a nominal input of [...] or less was able to have an energy factor as low as 53%, while under the 2015 standard, the minimum energy factor for a 75-US-gallon gas storage tank water heater is now 74%, {{which can only be}} achieved by using condensing technology. Storage water heaters with a nominal input of 75,000 btu or greater are not currently affected by these requirements, since energy factor is not defined for such units. An 80 gal electric storage tank water heater was able to have a minimum energy factor of 86% under the pre-2015 standard, while under the 2015 standard, the minimum energy factor for an 80-gallon electric storage tank water heater is now 197%, which is only possible with heat pump technology. It should be noted that this efficiency rating measures efficiency at the point of use. Depending on how electricity is generated, overall efficiency may be much lower. For example, in a traditional coal plant, only about 30-35% of the energy in the coal ends up as electricity {{on the other end of}} the generator. Losses on the electrical grid (including line losses and voltage transformation losses) reduce electrical efficiency further. According to data from the Energy Information Administration, transmission and distribution losses in 2005 consumed 6.1% of net generation. In contrast, 90% of natural gas’ energy value isdelivered to the consumer. (In neither case is the energy expended exploring, developing and extracting coal or natural gas resources included in the quoted efficiency numbers.) Gas tankless water heaters shall have an energy factor of 82% or greater under the 2015 standards, which corresponds to the pre-2015 Energy Star standard.|$|E
40|$|Water {{heating energy}} use is an {{important}} end use in low-rise residential buildings. Roughly 90 percent of California households use natural gas fueled water heaters, typically storage gas units with tank volumes of 40 to 50 gallons. Standby loss associated with the center flue gas <b>storage</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> design contributes 25 - 35 percent of a typical gas <b>storage</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> system's annual energy use. Whereas natural gas, (liquefied petroleum gas), LPG or oil can be burned directly to heat water, electricity is typically generated in a fossil fueled power plant where approximately two-thirds of the energy used to produce the electricity is lost in the generation, transmission, and distribution processes. The Standards require space conditioning and water heating systems to account for hourly usage impacts of the overall efficiency of each fuel type {{in the form of}} Time Dependent Valuation (TDV). Due to inefficiencies associated with generation and transmission, electric TDV essentially precludes the use of standard electric water heaters. Only electric heat pump water heaters, with significantly higher efficiencies than electric storage units, are closer to the efficiency of typical gas systems, even after accounting for TDV impacts. The figure below shows the energy flows that determine water heating energy usage. On the right hand side, hot water draws at the end use points define a load pattern that is imposed on the hot water distribution system that delivers water from the heating device to the use points. The heating device must meet this recovery load minus any contribution from auxiliary heat inputs, such as a solar thermal system. Energy use for water heating encompasses all energy uses; therefore, considerations of issues such as standby losses from the water heater or supplemental storage pump energy for recirculation systems, or impacts from supplemental heating must be considered in selecting a water heater that will comply...|$|E

40|$|Water heating is a main {{consumer}} {{of energy in}} households, especially in temperate and cold climates. In South Africa, where hot water is typically provided by electric resistance storage tank water heaters (geysers), water heating energy consumption exceeds cooking, refrigeration, and lighting {{to be the most}} consumptive single electric appliance in the home. A recent analysis for the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) performed by the authors estimated that standing losses from electric geysers contributed over 1, 000 kWh to the annual electricity bill for South African households that used them. In order to reduce this burden, the South African government is currently pursuing a programme of Energy Efficiency Standards and Labelling (EES&L) for electric appliances, including geysers. In addition, Eskom has a history of promoting heat pump water heaters (HPWH) through incentive programs, which can further reduce energy consumption.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the impact of {{different}} natural gas and electricity end-use technologies in the residential sector, which compete among themselves in terms of energy consumption and carbon emissions. The analysis of 17 different technology options, which were chosen in order to match the consumption behaviour of a typical Portuguese family, has shown that the use of electric heat pumps, both for space and water-heating, combined with the use of a natural gas cooker, leads to the lowest energy consumption and to the lowest environmental impacts in terms of carbon emissions. Considering only the running costs, this choice is 45 % more economic than having a natural gas centralised heating system combined with a gas cooker, and is 60 % more economic than having an electric resistance space heater combined with an electric <b>storage</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> and electric cooker, which is the worst case. The life cycle cost (LCC) analysis shows that the economic optimum is reached by the combination of a natural gas water heater with an electric storage space heater, and a natural gas cooker.

40|$|Energy {{required}} for water heating accounts for approximately 40 percent of national residential natural gas consumption in California. With water heating contributing such {{a substantial portion}} of natural gas consumption, it is important to pay attention to water heater efficiencies. This paper reports on an investigation of a patented, buoyancy-operated flue damper. It is an add-on design to a standard atmospherically vented natural-draft gas-fired <b>storage</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater.</b> The flue damper was expected to reduce off-cycle standby losses, which would lead to improvements in the efficiency of the water heater. The test results showed that the Energy Factor of the baseline water heater was 0. 576. The recovery efficiency was 0. 768. The standby heat loss coefficient was 10. 619 (BTU/hr-oF). After the damper was installed, the test results show an Energy Factor for the baseline water heater of 0. 605. The recovery efficiency was 0. 786. The standby heat loss coefficient was 9. 135 (BTU/hr-oF). The recovery efficiency increased 2. 3 percent and the standby heat loss coefficient decreased 14 percent. When the burner was on, the baseline water heater caused 28. 0 CFM of air to flow from the room. During standby, the flow was 12. 4 CFM. The addition of the damper reduced the flow when the burner was on to 23. 5 CFM. During standby, flow with the damper was reduced to 11. 1 CFM. The flue damper reduced off-cycle standby losses, and improved the efficiency of the water heater. The flue damper also improved the recovery efficiency of the water heater by restricting on-cycle air flows through the flue. With or without the flue damper, off-cycle air flow up the stack is nearly half the air flow rate as when the burner is firing...|$|E

40|$|Energy is {{the prime}} source of human {{activities}} in all sectors of life. Traditionally fossil fuel has been the prime source of energy. However, {{there are two major}} concerns regarding fossil fuels, i. e. their rapid depletion and their contribution towards growing global warming. It is being widely realized that for sustainable development presently used energy mediums such as fossil fuel and nuclear power have to be quickly replaced by renewable energy sources. The latter are sustainable and have the potential to meet present and future projected global energy demands without inflicting any environmental impacts. Pakistan is amongst the most prominent cotton producing countries in the world. The affluent availability of local cotton has lead to a well-established textile sector in Pakistan. A large proportion of its cotton products go into export. Being a successful candidate in international textile market Pakistani textile industry is continuously seeking modern and high-tech facilities to improve quality of its products. The biggest challenge Pakistani textile industry is facing today is how to cut down its environmental burdens to cope with the international standards on the issue.

40|$|The {{electric}} power grid is facing immense changes, {{the production of}} intermittent electricity is increasing {{at the same time}} as a big part of todays base load (mostly nuclear power) as well as the power reserve is in the process of being phased out. Due to these changes it is deemed that a larger amount of demand response will be needed in the near future. In order to accomplish this some sort of stimulus is required. Due to this accompanied by new indications from the regulatory authority Energimarknadsinspektionen Umeå Energi Elnät (UEEN) have started a process where they wish to investigate the consequences of abandoning their current pricing method in favor of a peak demand charge tariff. This new pricing method will increase the costumers ability to affect their electricity bill in addition to providing a higher degree of stimulus for demand response. This report is a part of that investigation and aims to quantify the costumers potential as well as the expected willingness for demand response och load shifting in adherence to the potential change in pricing methods. Accordingly. the question formulation for this thesis is as follows: What is the potential for load shifting, and a decreased power demand, due to a behavoiral change by the means of online measuring for households and business costumers in their testgroups respectively? What is the potential for load shifting, and a decreased power demand, by the means of enabling technology such as batteries, load limiting equipment, <b>storage</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> etc. ? How large is the economic stimulus for the costumers of UEEN to achieve load shifting by changing their behaviour or invest in enabling technology? A selection of costumers in four different neighbourhoods (a total of 793 costumers) were chosen, and measured data regaring their peak power demand and their monthly electricity consumption were used in the calculations of this thesis. Based on this data and a literature study conclusions regaring the costumers demand response and load shifting potential were drawn.  Out if the 793 costumers included in this study the absolute majority (771 costumers) currently have a fuse corresponding to 16 - 25 A which is why only the results for these costumers is presented below. According to a theoretical assessment almost all of the costumers included in this study have a possibility to shift a fairly big part of their load. However, according to the literature study, it is reasonable to expect a load shift corresponding to 2 - 5 % of the costumers peak demand due to behavioural changes as a consequense of online measuring accompanied by a peak demand charge tariff. This would coincide with a load shift of 0, 1 - 0, 45 kW per household during the winter season, which, for the majority of costumers, can be translated into an annual saving of 0 - 200 SEK/household.   With regards to the expected load shift by the means of enabling technology batteries is not considered to, due to its unprofibility, be a solution that constumers can be expected to invest in in the nearby future. The potential load shift as a result of regulating electricity based heating systems however, is considered to be significantly larger and is deemed to amount to 2 - 5 kW depending on the heating system and its as well as the builidings built-in heat storage capacity. Based on this, some assumptions regarding the constumers heating systems and their current power demand the potential costumer savings is evaluated to 300 - 750 SEK per year...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} Phase II of {{a project}} conducted for the Mechanical Utilities Division (UTel), Energy Management Program at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) by Architectural Energy Corporation (AEC). The overall project covers energy efficiency and water conservation auditing services for 215 modular and prefabricated buildings at LLNL. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate compliance with DOE Order 430. 2 A, Contractor Requirements Document section 2. d (2) Document, to demonstrate annual progress of at least 10 percent toward completing energy and water audits of all facilities. Although this project covers numerous buildings, they are all similar in design and use. The approach employed for completing audits for these facilities involves a ''model-similar building'' approach. In the model-similar building approach, similarities between groups of buildings are established and quantified. A model (or test case) building is selected and analyzed for each model-similar group using a detailed DOE- 2 simulation. The results are extended {{to the group of}} similar buildings based on careful application of quantified similarities, or ''extension measures''. This approach leverages the relatively minor effort required to evaluate one building in some detail to a much larger population of similar buildings. The facility wide energy savings potential was calculated for a select set of measures that have reasonable payback based on the detailed building analysis and are otherwise desirable to the LLNL facilities staff. The selected measures are: (1) HVAC Tune-up. This {{is considered to be a}} ''core measure'', based on the energy savings opportunity and the impact on thermal comfort. All HVAC units in the study are assumed to be tuned up under this measure. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building and HVAC unit. (2) HVAC system scheduling. This is also considered to be a ''core measure'', based on the energy savings opportunity and ability to control units centrally during a shelter-in-place event. All HVAC units in the study are assumed to be controlled under this measure. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building and HVAC unit. (3) Cool roof. Savings estimates for the measure were applied to all roofs scheduled for replacement in the LLNL deficiency list. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building. (4) Window shading. Savings estimates for the measure were applied to all non-north facing windows. Although the simple payback is not a good for this measure, it should be considered for the associated benefits on thermal comfort and to alleviate some of the zoning and thermostat placement issues. (5) HVAC upgrade at normal replacement. Savings estimates for the measure were applied to all HVAC units scheduled for replacement on the LLNL deficiency list. A total of 642 units (about 55 % of the total) are on the replacement list, so this represents a major opportunity. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building and HVAC unit. (6) Indirect/direct evaporative cooling. Savings estimates for the measure were applied to all HVAC units scheduled for replacement on the LLNL deficiency list. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building and HVAC unit. Due to the magnitude of the potential energy savings, this measure should be considered as the new generation IDEC systems become commercially available. (7) Super T- 8 's. Savings estimates for this measure were applied to all buildings in the study, assuming that the new generation lamps will be rotated in during normal lamp replacement operations. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building. (8) Occupancy sensors. Savings estimates for this measure were applied to buildings surveyed as candidates for occupancy sensors during the Level 1 audits. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building. (9) Remaining Lighting. Savings for this measure were calculated for each eligible fixture identified during the Level 1 Audits. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building and fixture.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project was to evaluate {{the potential impact of}} building and equipment energy codes and standards on gas equipment choice and consumption. Technical support for proposed revisions to the Council of American Building Officials (CABO) Model Energy Code (MEC) was provided in conjunction with the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). Existing vent termination requirements in state and model codes were characterized and evaluated, and uniform criteria for vent termination of gas appliances was recommended. Combustion air openings to the outdoors were evaluated and technical data were developed to provide combustion and ventilation air guidelines for gas appliances. The impact of reduced thermostat setpoints for residential <b>storage</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> was evaluated and revised sizing table based on a 135 F setpoint was produced. THe primary finding from the revised sizing table is that there is approximately a two-tank size difference between a gas and an electric <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> with setpoints of 135 F. ...|$|R

He later patented the design in 1890. In October 1890, he expanded {{on his first}} <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> design, under the Fuel Gas and Manufacturing Company.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company is}} named for its founders, {{brothers}} Richard [...] "R.S." [...] Rheem and Donald [...] "D.L." [...] Rheem. They were the sons of William S. Rheem (1862-1919), former Standard Oil Company of California president who led {{the construction of a}} major oil refinery for the company in Richmond, California. The brothers initially began manufacturing galvanized steel drums in 1925 as a co-partnership with Pacific Galvanizing Company in Emeryville, California. A third brother, William [...] "W.K." [...] Rheem, helped finance the company at its start. The Rheem Manufacturing Company was subsequently organized on January 22, 1930, buying out Pacific Galvanizing. Rheem also acquired the Republic Steel package company, which also had a plant in Richmond. Republic Steel made boilers and tanks, which allowed Rheem to enter the business of water heating. The company acquired the John Wood Manufacturing Company of California, which produced automatic gas <b>storage</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters,</b> in 1931. The company expanded overseas to Australia in 1936, building a plant in Sydney. The Australian operation began making steel shipping containers, including drums, in 1937 and <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> in 1939.|$|R
