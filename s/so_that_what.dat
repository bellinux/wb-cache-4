The 4th century Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem was rebuilt by Justinian I after {{a fire in the}} 6th century, but appears to have retained much of its original form, including its massive Roman colonnades.

Low's repair shop was saved, but some 400 sets of members' clubs were destroyed.

Low must have suffered the tortures of the damned as he responded to each replacement order, and he must have earned a pretty penny as he did so.

500|$|Historians today {{generally}} {{dismiss the}} authenticity of the find, attributing it to a publicity stunt performed to raise funds to repair the Abbey, which was mostly burned in 1184. William of Malmesbury's history of the English kings stated [...] "Arthur’s grave is nowhere seen, whence antiquity of fables still claims that he will return" [...] and his work [...] "On the Antiquity of the Glastonese Church"—larded as it is with known and suspected pious forgeries—nowhere mentions a connection between the abbey and either Arthur's grave or Avalon. The fact that the search for Arthur's body is connected to Henry II and Edward I, both kings who fought major Welsh wars, has had scholars suggest that propaganda may have played a part as well. Gerald, a constant supporter of royal authority, in his account of the discovery clearly aims to destroy the idea of the possibility of King's Arthur's messianic return: [...] "Many tales are told and many legends have been invented about King Arthur and his mysterious ending. In their stupidity the British [...] people maintain that he is still alive. Now that the truth is known, I have taken the trouble to add a few more details in this present chapter. The fairy-tales have been snuffed out, and the true and indubitable facts are made known, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> really happened must be made crystal clear to all and separated from the myths which have accumulated on the subject." ...|$|E
500|$|On 20 January 1843, Daniel M'Naghten {{attempted}} to assassinate Robert Peel, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Approaching {{a man he}} believed to be Peel, M'Naghten fired into his back, in fact killing Edward Drummond, Peel's secretary. Immediately arrested, {{he was charged with}} murder and tried on 3 March 1843 at the Old Bailey. He was assisted in his defence by two solicitors, four barristers including Alexander Cockburn and nine medical experts, along with eight lay witnesses. Both sides agreed that M'Naghten was insane; the question was what constituted a valid legal defence of insanity. The judges decided that [...] "every man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong", which was boiled down to [...] "did the defendant know what he was doing, and if <b>so,</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> he was doing was wrong?".

2500|$|In David Gordon's dances, simple {{movement}} phrases are reiterated until {{what you}} notice {{is not the}} movement itself but the distinctiveness of {{the bodies of the}} performers. Gordon's genius lies both in his choice of dancers, most noticeably his wife and longtime collaborator Valda Setterfield, and in his gestural vocabulary. Also, his use of language underscores the message of his dances, which is that the body's actions and signals, like words, can change their meaning depending on their context. The phrasing of Gordon's movements is uninflected, fluid, tending to slide comfortably through the memory, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> you want to pay attention to is the very manner in which these particular interesting figures do whatever it is they are doing.

2500|$|The above {{describes}} {{three stages}} as the spiritual {{order of the}} month of Tishrei unfolds: On Rosh Hashanah Jewish tradition maintains that God opens the books of judgment of creation and all mankind starting from each individual person, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> is decreed is first written in those books, hence {{the emphasis on the}} [...] "ketivah" [...] ("writing"). The judgment is then pending and prayers and repentance are required.

As {{childbirth}} educators {{continue the}} effort {{to find ways to}} educate women on the benefits of breastfeeding, it is increasingly difficult to find literature that appeals to teenagers and nonmedical personnel. Many texts are written at such a high level of language and complexity that they are inappropriate to recommend for the teenage girl or the educated woman who has no desire to become bogged down by the pathophysiology of the breast and the plethora of research that has been conducted. In her book <b>So</b> <b>That's</b> <b>What</b> They're For: Breastfeeding Basics (1998), Janet Tamaro achieves a balance between information, practical suggestions, anecdotes, and a good helping of humor to guide the pregnant or new mother through the decision and practice of breastfeeding...|$|R

Vaucanson is credited as having invented the world's first flexible rubber tube while in the process of building the duck's intestines.

2500|$|The {{score of}} a cricket team whose innings is in {{progress}} is given {{as the number of}} runs they have scored [...] "for" [...] the number of wickets their opponents have taken. For example, a team that has scored 100 runs and lost three wickets has a score of [...] "one hundred for three", written 100–3 (also 100/3); The exception to this is in Australia, where it is conventional to reverse the wickets and runs scored, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> would be written 100–3 elsewhere in the world is written and said 3–100 (or 3/100) in Australia. A team that is dismissed having scored 300 runs is said to have a score of [...] "three hundred all out", rather than [...] "three hundred for ten"; the score for the innings is then simply written 300. However, if a team declare their innings closed (in a First-class match) or reach an over limit (in a limited-overs match), the number of wickets is included in their score for the innings, for example 275–7. A declaration is noted by appending a [...] "d" [...] or [...] "dec" [...] to the score (for example 300–8d); such a score is spoken in the standard form with the word [...] "declared" [...] appended (example: [...] "300 for 8, declared").|$|E
2500|$|The story {{takes place}} {{in the late nineteenth century}} on what appears to be an {{alternative}} history of Earth, which is there called Demonia or Antiterra. Antiterra has the same geography and a largely similar history to that of Earth; however, it is crucially different at various points. For example, the United States includes all of the Americas (which were discovered by African navigators). But it was also settled extensively by Russians, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> we know as western Canada is a Russian-speaking province called [...] "Estoty", and eastern Canada a French-speaking province called [...] "Canady". Russian, English, and French are all in use in North America. The territory which belongs to Russia in our world, and much of Asia, is part of an empire called Tartary, while the word [...] "Russia" [...] is simply a [...] "quaint synonym" [...] for Estoty. The British Empire, which includes most or all of Europe and Africa, is ruled (in the nineteenth century) by a King Victor. Aristocracy is still widespread, but some technology has advanced well into twentieth-century forms. Electricity, however, has been banned since almost the time of its discovery following an event referred to as [...] "the L-disaster". Airplanes and cars exist, but television and telephones do not, their functions served by similar devices powered by water.
