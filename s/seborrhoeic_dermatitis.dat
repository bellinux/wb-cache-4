40|$|Purpose : Malassezia yeasts are {{globally}} distributed {{agents of}} pityriasis versicolor and are {{implicated in the}} pathogenesis of <b>seborrhoeic</b> and atopic <b>dermatitis.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to identify the Malassezia species obtained from pityriasis versicolor patients, using morphological, biochemical, physiological as well as Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. Materials and Methods: The identification of Malassezia species is performed according to microscopic features and physiological characteristics, including catalase reaction and Tween assimilation tests. The DNA is extracted from cultured Malassezia using the glass bead, phenol-chloroform method. The internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1) region is amplified and there is restricted digestion of the PCR products with two enzymes Cfo I and Bst F 5 I. Results : The most commonly isolated species is M. globosa (47. 6 &#x 0025;). RFLP analysis of the PCR products of the ITS 1 region is in complete agreement with those from the DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 region and the biochemical tests. Conclusion : Based on the findings of this study, it can be concluded that PCR-RFLP is a relatively simple and quick method, completely comparable to the routine methods used for Malassezia identification...|$|R

2500|$|Malessezia pachydermatis is an {{important}} pathogen in veterinary medicine. It {{has been known to}} become pathogenic to its host causing otitis and <b>seborrhoeic</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> First associated with canine otitis externa in 1955 by Benght A. Gustafson, this yeast has since become {{an important}} pathogen especially in the study of small animal medicine. Symptoms include excessive scratching, head shaking, odour, and reddish-brown waxy deposits within the ear canal. Malassezia pachydermatis caused canine <b>seborrhoeic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> was first discovered by Dufait in 1975 and may be characterized by symptoms ranging from dandruff to scaly lesions. At infection sites sebaceous secretions are increased. Differences to susceptibility can be seen across breeds for example, increased infection among the West Highland White Terrier has been attributed to [...] a genetic abnormality.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>seborrhoeic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> redness and itching {{frequently}} occur {{around the}} folds of the nose and eyebrow areas, not just the scalp. [...] Dry, thick, well-defined lesions consisting of large, silvery scales may be traced to the less common affliction of scalp psoriasis. Inflammation can be characterized by redness, heat, pain, swelling and can cause sensitivity.|$|E
2500|$|Zinc pyrithione is {{best known}} for its use in {{treating}} dandruff and <b>seborrhoeic</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> particularly in dandruff shampoos.

2500|$|<b>Seborrhoeic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> or {{seborrheic}} dermatitis ("cradle cap" [...] in infants) {{is a condition}} sometimes classified {{as a form of}} eczema that is closely related to dandruff. It causes dry or greasy peeling of the scalp, eyebrows, and face, and sometimes trunk. In newborns it causes a thick, yellow, crusty scalp rash called cradle cap, which seems related to lack of biotin and is often curable. (ICD-10 L21; L21.0) ...|$|E
2500|$|Cradle cap is a yellowish, patchy, greasy, scaly and crusty {{skin rash}} that occurs on the scalp of {{recently}} born babies. It {{is usually not}} itchy and does not bother the baby. Cradle cap most commonly begins sometime {{in the first three}} months but can occur in later years. Similar symptoms in older children are more likely to be dandruff than cradle cap. The rash is often prominent around the ear, the eyebrows or the eyelids. [...] It may appear in other locations as well, where it is called <b>seborrhoeic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> rather than cradle cap. Some countries use the term pityriasis capitis for cradle cap. It is extremely common, with about half of all babies affected. Most of them have a mild version of the disorder. Severe cradle cap is rare.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Seborrhoeic</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> {{also known}} as seborrhoeic eczema, or simply seborrhea, is a chronic, {{relapsing}} and usually mild dermatitis. It's a skin disorder affecting the scalp, face, and torso. Typically, it presents with scaly, flaky, itchy, and red skin. It particularly affects the sebaceous-gland-rich areas of the skin. In infants, <b>seborrhoeic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> is called [...] "cradle cap". In adolescents and adults, it usually presents as scalp scaling or as redness of the nasolabial fold.
