40|$|This paper {{presents}} smart caching {{schemes for}} Web browsers. For modern Web applications, the <b>style</b> <b>formatting</b> and layout calculation often account for {{substantial amounts of}} the local computation in order to render a Web page. In this paper, we propose two caching schemes to reduce the computation of <b>style</b> <b>formatting</b> and layout calculation, named smart style caching and layout caching, respectively. The stable style data and layout data for DOM (Document Object Model) elements are recorded to construct the caches when a Web page is browsed. The cached data is checked in the granularity of DOM elements and applied directly if the identified DOM element is not changed in the sequent visits to the same page. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed caching schemes based on the Webkit layout engine. The experimental results with Web pages from the Top 25 Web sites show that, with the smart style caching scheme enabled, the time consumed for <b>style</b> <b>formatting</b> is reduced by 64 % on average; with both the smart style caching scheme and layout caching scheme enabled, the time consumed for layout calculation are reduced by 61 % on average, and the overall performance improvement is about 46 %. © 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW 3 C 2) ...|$|E

40|$|The Abstract {{represents}} a brief, comprehensive {{summary of the}} contents of the manuscript. It allows the reader to review the purpose of the research, methods used by the researcher, results and implications emerging from the investigations. As such, {{it is important that the}} abstract reflects the main points from each section of the manuscript. Be sure to include information from each of the major sections of the paper (introduction, method, results, discussion). Individuals researching a topic will read the Abstract before deciding if the article is worth further inspection and thus it must be accurate, self-contained, concise and specific. Generally, Abstracts are approximately 120 words (960 characters which includes spaces between words) and written in such a way as to conserve characters. Thus, abbreviations are allowed if the meaning is obvious (i. e. vs. for versus) and digits can be used for numbers (i. e. 9 rather than nine). 2 Instructions for Writing a Research Report This guide for writing your manuscript is designed to give you some basic information about APA <b>style</b> <b>formatting,</b> writing style, the sections included in the proposal, and a template to follow when formatting the paper.

40|$|We {{address a}} {{parametric}} joint detection-estimation problem for discrete signals {{of the form}} x(t) = ∑_n= 1 ^Nα_n e^-i λ_n t + ϵ_t, t ∈N, with an additive noise represented by independent centered complex random variables ϵ_t. The distributions of ϵ_t {{are assumed to be}} unknown, but satisfying various sets of conditions. We prove {{that in the case of}} a heavy-tailed noise it is possible to construct asymptotically strongly consistent estimators for the unknown parameters of the signal, i. e., the frequencies λ_n, their number N, and complex amplitudes α_n. For example, one of considered classes of noise is the following: ϵ_t are independent identically distributed random variables with E (ϵ_t) = 0 and E (|ϵ_t| |ϵ_t|) < ∞. The construction of estimators is based on detection of singularities of anti-derivatives for Z-transforms and on a two-level selection procedure for special discretized versions of superlevel sets. The consistency proof relies on the convergence theory for random Fourier series. We discuss also decaying signals and the case of infinite number of frequencies.
