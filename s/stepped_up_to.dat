5|$|Fantastic Light {{began his}} three-year-old season {{with his first}} Group race win in the Sandown Classic Trial. Ridden by Daryll Holland, he took the lead a furlong out and was eased in the closing stages to win by a short head. Speculation that he might develop into a Derby {{contender}} ended in his next race, when he was <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{one and a half}} miles {{for the first time and}} finished fourth of the five runners in the Lingfield Derby Trial.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> be {{the team}} leader in 2003, {{with the goal}} of winning the Tour de France. He won Liège–Bastogne–Liège and was in form when he broke his {{collarbone}} in a pile-up on stage 1 of the Tour. He lost a lot of time. He made it up by winning a stage and finishing fourth, while his teammates Carlos Sastre and Jakob Piil also won stages.|$|E

5|$|Seeing no {{immediate}} prospects for advancement, Blamey {{transferred from the}} Permanent Military Forces to the Militia on 1 September 1925. For the next 14 years he would remain in the Army as a part-time soldier. On 1 May 1926 he assumed command of the 10th Infantry Brigade, part of the 3rd Division. Blamey <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> command the 3rd Division on 23 March 1931, and was promoted to major general, one of only four Militia officers promoted to this rank between 1929 and 1939. In 1937 he {{was transferred to the}} unattached list.|$|E
5|$|When the {{generator}} building first went into operation, it housed two Westinghouse horizontal generators originally rated at 6,600 volts, operating at 225 rpm and producing 3 phase 60 cycle AC. They were driven by turbines. The voltage was <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 100,000 volts using three delta-connected oil-cooled transformers of 3,000 kilowatt capacity. These were regulated with oil switches, and the transformers and switch gear were {{housed in the}} south end of {{the generator}} building.|$|E
5|$|Despite Arsenal being {{reduced to}} 10 men, the scores {{remained}} {{level as the}} game went into its final minute, when Diego Forlán went to ground in the penalty area under a challenge from Arsenal defender Martin Keown while trying to reach a Gary Neville cross. The referee deemed this a foul and awarded a penalty. Van Nistelrooy <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take the penalty, despite having missed his previous two penalties for Manchester United. Lehmann tried to put him off by moving {{from side to side}} along the goal line, and it appeared to work: the shot hit the bar and rebounded back into play, and the Dutchman was immediately confronted by Keown. Within a minute, the final whistle blew and the match finished as a goalless draw.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, the Indians {{opened up the}} game. Boudreau and Joe Gordon hit {{back-to-back}} singles, which brought Keltner to the plate. The Red Sox expected a bunt, but instead the third baseman hit his 31st home run of the season to put the Indians ahead, 4–1. Galehouse was then replaced with Ellis Kinder, who was met with a double by Larry Doby. Kinder responded by getting the next three batters out, which brought the score to 5–1 as Doby also scored. After Bearden got three Red Sox out, the Indians started the fifth inning with {{the top of their}} lineup. Mitchell and Eddie Robinson, who came in for Clark, were out. Boudreau then <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the plate and hit his second home run of the night to make the score 6–1.|$|E
5|$|Van Nistelrooy {{took the}} first penalty for Manchester United, {{in front of the}} United fans, and sent Lehmann the wrong way to give United the early advantage. Lauren then {{converted}} the next penalty for Arsenal, before Scholes <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take United's second, only to see it saved by Lehmann, diving low to his right. The next six penalties were all scored – Ljungberg, Van Persie and Cole for Arsenal, Ronaldo, Rooney and Keane for Manchester United – leaving Vieira with the opportunity to win the FA Cup for his team. Although Carroll guessed the correct way to dive, Vieira's kick was just out of his reach, giving Arsenal their 10th FA Cup.|$|E
5|$|With Adrian Peterson still {{recovering}} from breaking his collar bone against Iowa State and Allen Patrick on the sidelines in an ankle brace after suffering a late-game sprain the week before, {{many aspects of the}} offense were in doubt coming into this game. Paul Thompson responded by putting up a career-high 309yards passing, completing 24 of 31attempts. True-freshman running back Chris Brown also <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the challenge and ran for 84yards and two touchdowns, both in the fourth quarter; {{this was the first time}} in 16games that a Sooner back did not run for over 100yards.|$|E

5|$|Galatasaray's Ergün Penbe <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{take the}} first spot kick and scored. He placed the ball inside the near {{right-hand}} corner, just past Seaman, who dived to his left. Davor Šuker was the first man up to take Arsenal's penalty kick. His effort proved to be unsuccessful, as the ball hit the left-hand post and bounced off the goal. Şükür became the next player to take Galatasaray's spot kick. He scored as he lobbed {{the ball in the}} right-hand corner. With Galatasaray leading 2–0, Arsenal's next penalty taker was Parlour. He placed the ball on the spot and successfully scored by burying the ball to Taffarel's right to make it 2–1. Ümit Davala calmly placed the goal, near the centre of the goal to make it 3–1 to Galatasaray. Arsenal's only hope now was Vieira, but the midfielder missed and hit the crossbar instead. Popescu then stepped up, and netted with a powerful shot, as Galatasaray won the penalty shoot-out 4–1.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, {{the club}} {{followed}} Salisbury and <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Western League. This {{proved to be}} quite a different challenge—whereas before they had only competed against local teams in league competition, they now faced opposition from teams as far afield as Avon, Somerset and Devon as well as the reserve teams of league clubs such as Bristol Rovers, Bristol City and Torquay United. They generally fared well, only failing to finish in {{the top half of the}} table twice during their time at this level. Their first season in the Western League saw the club reach the first round proper of the FA Cup for the only time in their history after defeating Hendon 5–4 in a fourth qualifying round replay. On 3 November, Fourth Division side Gillingham came to the Walled Meadow and won 1–0 in front of 3484 spectators, a figure which would remain as the club's largest attendance for a home game. In the league Andover finished fourth, but that was their highest placing until 1969–70 when they finished as runners-up.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} that {{followed}} the brigade undertook defensive duties as the Germans attempted to apply pressure on the beachhead by infiltrating the defensive positions on the eastern flank. On 12 June, the airborne troops launched {{an attack on the}} village of Breville from where German artillery had been shelling them during the preceding week. Although successful, British casualties were high. Having been subjected to an intense artillery barrage, No. 6 Commando suffered 16 casualties. The barrage also wounded the brigade commander, Lord Lovat, to the extent that No. 6 Commando's commanding officer, Mills-Roberts, although wounded himself, was asked to take over from him. Major Anthony Lewis, formerly of the Dorset Regiment, <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take over as commanding officer temporarily, before being confirmed in the role on 24 June and receiving a promotion to acting-lieutenant colonel. He remained in command until 8 August 1944, when Lieutenant Colonel Charles Courtney-Coade of the South Staffordshire Regiment took over, and Lewis reverted to the role of second-in-command.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, RhAR patrols in the Chaah, Labis, Bekok and Sungai Karas areas were <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> last between 10 and 18 days each, but {{contacts}} with the communist forces remained rare. The constant patrols gradually began to take their toll on the insurgents, and guerrillas began to give themselves up increasingly frequently. A contributing factor here was Britain's granting of independence to Malaya within the Commonwealth on 31 August 1957, which dented the motivation of many fighters. Starting in October 1957, the RhAR were tasked to work alongside former MNLA personnel to wipe out any remaining communist forces in the region. The ex-insurgents were supposed to lead the security forces to MNLA camps and resting places, but this strategy was not successful. The RhAR soon developed a low opinion of these ex-MNLA men.|$|E
5|$|RB Leipzig faced Sevilla in {{the opening}} match of the tournament; the German side were without striker Timo Werner, but manager Ralph Hasenhüttl named new signing Jean-Kevin Augustin in his first eleven. Midfielder Emil Forsberg forced Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico into action early on with a shot, but the ball was comfortably held on to. RB Leipzig {{continued}} to create chances and in the 18th minute a ball played over the Sevilla defence found Augustin. The forward's volley however flew over the goal and into the stand. Sevilla's first meaningful attack just after the half-hour mark resulted in a penalty. Bernardo's challenge on Walter Montoya in the penalty area was adjudged as a foul, despite video replays showing the defender managed to take the ball off the Sevilla midfielder. Wissam Ben Yedder <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take the penalty and duly converted to give Sevilla the lead. The scoreline remained 1–0, despite both clubs' best efforts to score.|$|E
5|$|Smith became Deputy Prime Minister {{following}} the Rhodesian Front's December 1962 election victory, and <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the premiership after Field resigned in April 1964. With the UK government refusing to grant independence while Rhodesia did not devise a set timetable for {{the introduction of}} majority rule, talks with the UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson repeatedly broke down, leading Smith and his Cabinet to declare independence on 11 November 1965. His government endured {{in the face of}} United Nations economic sanctions with the assistance of South Africa and, until 1974, Portugal. Talks with the UK in 1966, 1968 and 1971 came to nothing. Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970 and led the RF to three more decisive election victories over the next seven years. After the Bush War began in earnest in 1972, he negotiated with the non-militant nationalist leader Bishop Abel Muzorewa and the rival guerrilla movements headed by Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe.|$|E

Sellheim left {{to command the}} new Intermediate Base Depot on 12 January 1915. Patterson <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> become AA & QMG, and Gellibrand to become DAA & QMG. Foott took Gellibrand's place as DAQMG, and Captain Thomas Griffiths became DAAG. Gellibrand landed at Anzac Cove with the second echelon of 1st Division Headquarters at around 09:00 on 25 April 1915. As DAA & QMG, {{he was responsible for}} supply. He helped organise the beach parties, rounded up stragglers, and organised the movement of supplies and ammunition forward. Patterson had a nervous breakdown and was evacuated on 28 April 1915, Gellibrand performed his job as well until Lieutenant Colonel John Forsyth was appointed AA & QMG on 7 May 1915.|$|E
5|$|The rivalry {{escalated}} in September 2003, when Arsenal travelled to Old Trafford. In {{the match}} Vieira was shown a second yellow card {{for his part}} in an altercation with striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, and during stoppage time, defender Martin Keown brought down Diego Forlán in the Arsenal penalty area. United were awarded a penalty and Van Nistelrooy <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take it, but his shot rebounded off the crossbar. This was followed by scenes of jubilation from the Arsenal players, who confronted Van Nistelrooy after his miss and the resulting scuffle led to another fracas after the final whistle. The FA immediately took action, charging six of Arsenal's players (Jens Lehmann, Ray Parlour, Lauren, Cole, Keown and Vieira) with improper conduct. The club was fined £175,000, the largest ever given to a club by the FA at the time. Lauren received a four-game ban, whereas Vieira and Parlour were given one-match suspensions.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the 1948 Arab Israeli War, the {{majority}} of volunteer airmen returned home, and 69 Squadron once again went through a period of reorganization. From an English-speaking outfit it was transformed into a Hebrew speaking unit. Training was <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> qualify Israelis to take over vacated positions and the squadron settled into a peacetime routine, with the B-17s conducting bombing and cloud seeding tests and participating in IDF exercises. The IAF itself was undergoing major changes, and in early May 1949 69 Squadron relocated to Tel Nof. In October 1951 the squadron moved once more, this time to Hatzor. In December 1952 the three B-17 was joined by three PBY Catalinas, acquired to guarantee supply to the town of Eilat at Israel's southern extremity. Utilization of these aircraft, however, was low and they were soon withdrawn from service with the squadron. Spares, meanwhile, were also hampering B-17 operations and in March 1954 69 Squadron was deactivated and its assests handed over to 103 Squadron, which soon retired the Catalinas but continued to operate the three B-17s.|$|E
