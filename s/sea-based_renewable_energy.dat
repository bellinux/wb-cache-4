After that, we study the achievements and problems in China's wind and solar PV sector during 2005 - 2012 and argue that China's policy approach to <b>renewable</b> <b>energies</b> has placed priority first on developing a <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> manufacturing industry and only second on <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> itself, {{and it has not}} effectively met the ideal of appropriate interactions between <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> policy and <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> industrial policy.
