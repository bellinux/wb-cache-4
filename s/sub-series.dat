5|$|A {{large number}} of {{spin-off}} video games have also been made for the Final Fantasy series. These spin-off games vary in their relation to the main series; the first, The Final Fantasy Legend games, were marketed as related in North America but {{were considered to be}} the first three games of the SaGa series in their native Japan, and later SaGa games released outside Japan bear no Final Fantasy branding. Dissidia Final Fantasy, on the other hand, is a fighting game using characters from the main series exclusively. Overall, more than 30 games have been released as spin-offs of the main Final Fantasy series, many within their own <b>sub-series.</b>|$|E
5|$|Blyton's Noddy, about {{a little}} wooden boy from Toyland, first {{appeared}} in the Sunday Graphic on 5 June 1949, and in November that year Noddy Goes to Toyland, the first of at least two dozen books in the series, was published. The idea was conceived by one of Blyton's publishers, Sampson, Low, Marston and Company, who in 1949 arranged a meeting between Blyton and the Dutch illustrator Harmsen van der Beek. Despite having to communicate via an interpreter, he provided some initial sketches of how Toyland and its characters would be represented. Four days after the meeting Blyton sent the text of the first two Noddy books to her publisher, to be forwarded to van der Beek. The Noddy books became one of her most successful and best-known series, and were hugely popular in the 1950s. An extensive range of <b>sub-series,</b> spin-offs and strip books were produced throughout the decade, including Noddy's Library, Noddy's Garage of Books, Noddy's Castle of Books, Noddy's Toy Station of Books and Noddy's Shop of Books.|$|E
5|$|The Metroid Prime <b>sub-series,</b> {{which takes}} place between Metroid and , has its titular {{installment}} feature Samus traveling to the planet Tallon IV, which contains a Chozo colony in ruins and a Space Pirate base. There she learns of Phazon, a mysterious mutagen that can alter the genetic material of any organism. Samus is eventually able to access {{the source of the}} planet's Phazon contamination, a meteor impact crater, where she defeats the Phazon-infused creature Metroid Prime. In Metroid Prime Hunters, Samus competes against six rival bounty hunters in a race to recover an alien ultimate weapon. In , Samus is sent to the planet Aether, a Phazon meteor-ravaged planet split into light and dark dimensions. There she battles the Ing, creatures that are able to possess other organisms, and Dark Samus, an evil doppelgänger of herself formed from the remains of her Phazon Suit and Metroid Prime itself. In , Dark Samus infects Samus with Phazon, which slowly corrupts her and further forces her to prevent it from spreading to other planets. By the end of the game, she renders all Phazon inert by destroying its original source, the planet Phaaze, and permanently destroys Dark Samus. In , Samus is tasked by the Galactic Federation to investigate the Space Pirates' presence in the Bermuda System and provide intelligence to the Federation Force. However, after the Force abruptly loses contact with her, they later discover that she had been captured by the Pirates and is brainwashed into fighting them while in her Morph Ball form. After the Federation Force reluctantly defeat her, they proceed to help their fleet destroy the Pirates' massive battleship before narrowly escaping death {{with the help of a}} recovered Samus.|$|E

25|$|Warriors: The Prophecies Begin is {{the first}} story arc in the Warriors {{juvenile}} fantasy novel series about anthropomorphic feral cats. The arc comprises six novels which were published from 2003 to 2004: Into the Wild, Fire and Ice, Forest of Secrets, Rising Storm, A Dangerous Path, and The Darkest Hour. The novels are published by HarperCollins under the pseudonym Erin Hunter, which refers to authors Kate Cary and Cherith Baldry and plot developer/editor Victoria Holmes. The <b>sub-series</b> details the adventures of the housecat Rusty, who joins ThunderClan, one of four Clans of feral cats living in a forest which adjoins the human town in which he originally lives. The arc's major themes deal with forbidden love, the concept of nature versus nurture, and characters being a mix of good and bad. Though the novels have appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List and have been nominated for several awards, none of the novels in the Warriors <b>sub-series</b> have won a significant literary award.|$|E
25|$|The suffix W e.g.: -10W denotes a <b>sub-series</b> {{modified}} to use A.D.I Anti-Detonant Injection or water injection equipment, using various mixes {{of water and}} methyl alcohol (CH3OH) injected into the carburetor to increase power for short periods: several models of R-2800s were fitted as standard with A.D.I and {{did not use the}} W suffix. Few commercial aircraft used water injection.|$|E

25|$|Dragon Quest IV is {{the first}} game in the series to spawn spin-offs. The {{merchant}} Torneko (also known as Taloon in the NES version) was popular enough to star his own series, in which he finds himself in quests in order to expand his store. These games are the Torneko no Daibouken <b>sub-series</b> (translated as Torneko's Great Adventure), roguelike and random dungeon games produced by Enix (and Square Enix) and developed by Chunsoft. The success of the games later inspired {{the creation of the}} Mystery Dungeon series.|$|E
25|$|This <b>sub-series</b> of two 4-car sets was {{introduced}} on 17 April 2005 {{as part of}} the scheme to eliminate 103 series sets from the Kawagoe Line and Hachikō Line. Set number 71 consists of two former TWR 70-000 series control cars with two newly manufactured intermediate cars, while set number 72 consists entirely of former 70-000 series cars.

25|$|For 1970, the Torino now {{became the}} primary {{model and the}} Fairlane was a <b>sub-series</b> of Torino. Ford moved away from emulating the boxy lines of the {{full-size}} Fords to a completely new body for the 1970 Torino/Fairlane line influenced by coke bottle styling. Just as tailfins were influenced by jet aircraft of the 1950s, stylists such as Ford stylist Bill Shenk who designed the 1970 Ford Torino were inspired by supersonic aircraft with narrow waists and bulging forward and rear fuselages needed to reach supersonic speeds (see Area rule).|$|E
25|$|Mega Man Legends, {{known in}} Japan as , is an action-adventure shooter game {{released}} by Capcom.

Another port was released for Microsoft Windows in 2001, and PlayStation Portable in 2005, with the latter exclusively in Japan.|$|E
25|$|This <b>sub-series</b> {{represented}} a stop-gap for use from 1998 on the Chūō-Sōbu Line until the full-production E231 series trains were delivered. The 17 ten-car sets differ noticeably {{from the other}} 209 series variants in having 2,966mm wide cars (compared to 2,870mm for earlier flat-sided stock), as well as LED destination indicators, replacing the earlier roller blind type. While externally similar in appearance to the later E231 series sets, the 209-500 series are distinguishable by their white cab fronts and lack of six-door cars. Five sets were transferred to the Keihin-Tōhoku Line, and, from October 2008, these were modified (with ATS-P/SN instead of ATC), repainted, and transferred to the Keiyō Line following {{the introduction of new}} E233 series trains.
