5|$|Zinc {{burns in}} {{air with a}} bright bluish-green flame, giving off fumes of zinc oxide. Zinc reacts readily with acids, alkalis and other non-metals. Extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at room {{temperature}} with acids. <b>Strong</b> <b>acids,</b> such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, can remove the passivating layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|Hydrofluoric acid is {{a contact}} poison with greater hazards than many <b>strong</b> <b>acids</b> like sulfuric acid {{even though it}} is weak: it remains neutral in aqueous {{solution}} and thus penetrates tissue faster, whether through inhalation, ingestion or the skin, and at least nine U.S. workers died in such accidents from 1984 to 1994. It reacts with calcium and magnesium in the blood leading to hypocalcemia and possible death through cardiac arrhythmia. Insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain and burns larger than 160cm2 (25in2) can cause serious systemic toxicity.|$|E
50|$|A <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> is {{one that}} is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For example, {{hydrochloric}} acid, HCl, is a <b>strong</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|R
25|$|In a <b>strong</b> <b>acid,</b> {{equilibrium}} lies {{far to the}} right, {{meaning that}} almost all of the original HA is dissociated at equilibrium. A <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> yields a weak conjugate base (A−), so a <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> is also described as an acid whose conjugate base is a much weaker base than water.|$|R
5000|$|Hydrobromic <b>acid</b> is a <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> {{formed by}} {{dissolving}} the diatomic molecule hydrogen bromide (HBr) in water. [...] "Constant boiling" [...] hydrobromic acid is an aqueous solution that distills at 124.3 °C and contains 47.6% HBr by weight, which is 8.89 mol/L. Hydrobromic acid has a pKa of −9, {{making it a}} <b>stronger</b> <b>acid</b> than hydrochloric acid, but not as <b>strong</b> as hydroiodic <b>acid.</b> Hydrobromic acid {{is one of the}} <b>strongest</b> mineral <b>acids</b> known.|$|R
5|$|Of the six common strong {{mineral acids}} in chemistry, {{hydrochloric}} acid is the monoprotic acid {{least likely to}} undergo an interfering oxidation-reduction reaction. It {{is one of the}} least hazardous <b>strong</b> <b>acids</b> to handle; despite its acidity, it consists of the non-reactive and non-toxic chloride ion. Intermediate-strength hydrochloric acid solutions are quite stable upon storage, maintaining their concentrations over time. These attributes, plus {{the fact that it is}} available as a pure reagent, make hydrochloric acid an excellent acidifying reagent.|$|E
5|$|The phrase {{acid rain}} {{was first used}} by Scottish chemist Robert Augus Smith in 1852. The pH of rain varies, {{especially}} due to its origin. On America's East Coast, rain that {{is derived from the}} Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0-5.6; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3.8-4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0. Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two <b>strong</b> <b>acids,</b> sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels, and mining where H2S is present. Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, soil bacteria, and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants. In the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which {{may be due to the}} significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the pH.|$|E
25|$|<b>Strong</b> <b>acids</b> are {{distinguished}} from weak acids (see below), in which dissociation is incomplete and is represented as an equilibrium, not a completed reaction. The typical {{definition of a}} weak acid is any acid that does not dissociate completely. The difference separating the acid dissociation constants of <b>strong</b> <b>acids</b> from all other acids {{is so great that}} this is a reasonable demarcation.|$|E

50|$|Sulfonic <b>acids</b> {{are much}} <b>stronger</b> <b>acids</b> than the {{corresponding}} carboxylic acids. p-Toluenesulfonic acid, with a pKa of −2.8, {{is about a}} million times <b>stronger</b> <b>acid</b> than benzoic acid, with a pKa of 4.2. Similarly, methanesulfonic acid, pKa = −1.9, is also about one million times <b>stronger</b> <b>acid</b> than acetic acid. Because of their polarity, sulfonic acids tend to be crystalline solids. They are also usually colourless and nonoxidizing, which is convenient. Because of their high acidity, sulfonic acids are often soluble in water or exhibit detergent-like properties.|$|R

25|$|In this solvent, {{acetic acid}} as solute is a <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> and ionizes completely, {{and has the}} same {{strength}} as HCl (at the same concentration. The acidities of both acetic acid and HCl are leveled to that of NH4+ which is the <b>strongest</b> <b>acid</b> that exists in liquid ammonia solution.|$|R

25|$|HF-SbF5 is {{extremely}} corrosive, toxic, and moisture sensitive. Like most <b>strong</b> <b>acids,</b> fluoroantimonic acid can react violently with water, {{owing to the}} exothermic hydration. Consequently, it cannot be used in aqueous solution, only in hydrogen fluoride as solvent.|$|E
25|$|Replacing an indole with a 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl group {{give the}} {{reaction}} named the Pictet–Spengler tetrahydroisoquinoline synthesis. Reaction conditions are generally harsher than the indole variant, and require refluxing conditions with <b>strong</b> <b>acids</b> like hydrochloric acid, trifluoroacetic acid or superacids.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonic acids, {{which are}} organic oxyacids, are {{a class of}} <b>strong</b> <b>acids.</b> A common example is p-toluene{{sulfonic}} acid (tosylic acid).

40|$|Acid {{strength}} {{distribution and}} the distribution of aromatics formed in the FCC gasoline conversion reaction on a ZSM- 5 zeolite with different Na contents have been studied. With increasing Na content in the ZSM- 5 zeolite, the acid sites determined by NH 3 -TPD technique, especially the <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> sites, clearly decrease. When used as catalyst for the aromatization reaction, the transformation of olefins in the FCC gasoline into aromatics is governed directly by the <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> sites on the ZSM- 5 catalyst.
