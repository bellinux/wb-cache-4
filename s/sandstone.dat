5|$|All of the localities that Eolambia were {{discovered}} in belong to the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation. Predominant rocks in the Mussentuchit consist of interleaved light gray to gray layers of muddy <b>sandstone</b> and mudstone. Deposits representing two separate river channel systems are also present in the Mussentuchit. The lower of these systems consists of four layers, respectively of muddy <b>sandstone,</b> fine-grained <b>sandstone,</b> silty mudstone, and fine-grained <b>sandstone,</b> with the latter two layers bearing plant debris. The Cifelli #2 Quarry is associated with this system. The upper system consists of greenish fine-grained <b>sandstone.</b> Three layers of bentonite clay layers, representing volcanic ash deposits, are also present in the Mussentuchit, being respectively whitish-gray, yellow, and tan in color. The middle of these layers cuts through the Cifelli #2 Quarry. Bentonite is also present within the <b>sandstone</b> itself throughout the Mussentuchit. In the Cifelli #2 quarry, the bones themselves are blackened, having been replaced by calcite, quartz, pyrite, and carbonate-hydroxyapatite.|$|E
5|$|An {{unconformity}} {{lies between}} the Catskill Formation and the Spechty Kopf Formation. The <b>sandstone</b> {{in the latter}} formation are mostly cross-bedded, although some areas have planar bedding. The Llewellyn Formation, containing conglomerate and <b>sandstone</b> {{is found in the}} Spring Run and Sugar Notch Run sub-watersheds.|$|E
5|$|Four major rock {{formations}} {{are present in}} Worlds End State Park, all at least partly from the Carboniferous period. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points in the park, is the early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain <b>sandstone,</b> siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal. The Loyalsock gorge rim and {{the upper part of}} its walls are the late Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation, which is formed with grayish-red shale, siltstone, <b>sandstone,</b> and conglomerate. Below this is the Mississippian Burgoon Formation, which comprises buff-colored <b>sandstone</b> and conglomerate. The creek bed and base of the gorge walls are the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray <b>sandstone.</b>|$|E
40|$|Lithofacies and granulometric {{analysis}} {{were carried out}} to decipher the depositional environment of the Fort Member of the Jurassic Jaisalmer Formation. Based on field data nine lithofacies have been identified including trough cross-bedded <b>sandstones,</b> planar cross-bedded <b>sandstones,</b> matrix supported conglomerates, thinly bedded siltstone and <b>sandstones,</b> herringbone cross-bedded <b>sandstones,</b> wave rippled <b>sandstones,</b> laminated <b>sandstones,</b> hummocky cross-bedded <b>sandstones,</b> limestones and shales. Granulometric analysis of the <b>sandstones</b> samples {{has been carried out}} for their statistical and textural parameters. Bivariant plots of textural parameters such as graphic skewness versus graphic standard deviation and kewness versus standard deviation confirm the high energy (beach) origin of <b>sandstones.</b> These results suggest a wide spectrum of marine environments ranging from inner shelf to upper shoreface for the Fort Member <b>sandstones...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Wapiti Formation {{consists}} of interbedded <b>sandstones,</b> siltstones, shales and mudstones, with thin conglomerates, coal seams and bentonite beds. The <b>sandstones</b> are typically thick, pale grey, crossbedded and bentonitic. The middle part contains less <b>sandstones,</b> more mudstones, and fewer and thinner coals. The upper part contains thicker lenticular <b>sandstones</b> and more coals.|$|R
30|$|A turbidite is {{the result}} of fluid transport, and the depositional {{structures}} and components of turbidity-current <b>sandstones</b> are not as much as those of sandy-debris-flow <b>sandstones.</b> Mud samples such as floating mudstone clasts and muddy coatings on the mud-coated intraclasts, which are abundant in the sandy-debris-flow <b>sandstones,</b> are not present in the turbidity-current <b>sandstones.</b> It is difficult to conduct quantitative analysis by means of elemental geochemical methods.|$|R
5|$|Most of Inchkeith is of {{volcanic}} origin {{but there are}} also sections of <b>sandstone,</b> coal, limestone and shale, the last named containing numerous fossils. There are also several springs on the island. Inchcolm is similarly varied, consisting of greenstone, <b>sandstone,</b> shale and limestone.|$|E
5|$|The Old Man of Hoy {{is a red}} <b>sandstone</b> stack and {{perched on}} a plinth of basalt rock. It is {{separated}} from the mainland by a 60-metre (200ft) chasm strewn with debris, and has nearly vertical sides with a top just a few metres wide. The rock is composed of layers of soft, sandy and pebbly <b>sandstone</b> and harder flagstones of Old Red <b>Sandstone,</b> giving the sides a notched and slab-like profile.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is in the}} West Branch Pine Creek {{drainage}} basin, {{where the}} underlying rocks are primarily conglomerate, <b>sandstone,</b> and shale. Two major rock formations are present in Cherry Springs State Park, both at least partly from the Carboniferous period. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points in the park, is the early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain <b>sandstone,</b> siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal. The lower formation is the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray <b>sandstone.</b> Outside the park the creek has cut down into the Devonian Catskill Formation, a reddish <b>sandstone.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Edmonton Group {{consists}} of fine-grained <b>sandstones,</b> calcareous <b>sandstones,</b> siltstones, sandy shales and mudstones, bentonitic <b>sandstones</b> and shales, bentonite beds, ironstone concretions, carbonaceous shales and coal seams. Hard <b>sandstones</b> commonly cap mesas, buttes and plateaus where erosion has formed badlands topography, {{as is the}} case for much of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation and the Scollard Formation. Coarse-grained sediments are rare in the Edmonton Group.|$|R
50|$|The Stoer Group {{outcrops}} on {{the peninsula}} of Stoer, near Assynt, Sutherland. A basal breccia is present in many areas with large clasts derived from the underlying Lewisian. The breccia passes up into muddy <b>sandstones,</b> often with well-preserved desiccation structures, and into deposits of a braided river system, trough cross-bedded <b>sandstones</b> and conglomerates. A thin sequence of siltstones and fine <b>sandstones</b> alternate with muddy <b>sandstones,</b> suggesting deposition in a lacustrine environment. The uppermost part of the sequence consists of trough cross-bedded <b>sandstones</b> {{thought to have been}} deposited by braided rivers.|$|R
30|$|Aqueously {{deposited}} aeolian <b>sandstones</b> of the Qigequan Formation {{are dominated}} by coarse to fine siltstones. <b>Sandstones</b> exhibit relatively higher SiO 2, Na 2 O, and MgO contents than the sand dam sediments in the lakeshore. <b>Sandstones</b> consist of well-sorted and rounded pure quartz clasts with single mode grain size distribution and few suspension materials. Microscopic (SEM) imaging of <b>sandstones</b> revealed dish-shaped pits and crescent-shaped pits in the surface of grains.|$|R
5|$|The {{southern}} and western {{parts of the}} walls were originally faced with a local ashlar <b>sandstone</b> with a core of basalt rubble; the <b>sandstone</b> was mostly quarried at Howick. The <b>sandstone</b> has since been stripped from the western parts of the wall, and the <b>sandstone</b> along {{the eastern end of}} the walls gives way to small limestone blocks, originally only laid 11-foot (3.3 m) high with a 4-foot 11 inches (1.5 m) parapet, but later raised in height with additional basalt boulders, probably during the Wars of the Roses. It is uncertain if the curtain wall originally extended above the cliffs along the northern edge of the castle.|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} major rock {{formations}} from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods {{are present in}} Quehanna Wild Area. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points on the plateau, is the Pennsylvanian Allegheny Formation, which has clay, coal, limestone, <b>sandstone,</b> and shale. Below this is the Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain <b>sandstone,</b> siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal, and which forms much of the Quehanna plateau. The next formations {{are found in the}} valleys and gorges which the creeks have eroded over time. The first of these is the Mississippian Pocono Formation, which is buff colored with shale, coal, and conglomerate inclusions; parts of this formation are also known as the Burgoon <b>Sandstone.</b> Below this is the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray <b>sandstone.</b> The lowest and oldest layer is the red shale and siltstone of the Catskill Formation.|$|E
5|$|Drainage of the Widnes area is {{into the}} Mersey via Ditton, Steward's and Bower's Brooks. The bedrock {{of the area}} is rock from the Sherwood <b>sandstone</b> group. There are a few {{outcrops}} of <b>sandstone</b> but elsewhere the bedrock is covered by drift. Most of this consists of till except near {{the bank of the}} Mersey where it is recent alluvium.|$|E
50|$|The Ma Butte Formation is {{a unit of}} the Blairmore Group. It {{consists}} {{primarily of}} fine-grained <b>sandstones</b> interbedded with siltstones and mudstones. Some coarser grained <b>sandstones</b> and conglomerate beds are also present. Beds of bentonite and tuff increase upward toward the contact with the overlying Crowsnest Formation. The <b>sandstones</b> of the Ma Butte Formation are quartzose, in contrast with the feldspathic <b>sandstones</b> of the underlying Beaver Mines Formation.|$|R
50|$|The Willow Creek Formation is {{composed}} of non-marine varicolored shales, red beds and <b>sandstones.</b> The shales and red beds include calcite nodules and caliche deposits. The <b>sandstones</b> are soft, light grey, massively bedded and cross-bedded, with harder conglomeratic <b>sandstones</b> toward {{the base of the}} formation.|$|R
5000|$|Arkose <b>sandstones</b> {{are more}} than 25 percent feldspar. The grains tend to be poorly rounded and less well sorted than those of pure quartz <b>sandstones.</b> These feldspar-rich <b>sandstones</b> come from rapidly eroding {{granitic}} and metamorphic terrains where chemical weathering is subordinate to physical weathering.|$|R
5|$|Except for {{the iron}} or steel {{included}} in the bridges and the water tower, the structures are built in brick or stone. The stone is almost invariably red <b>sandstone,</b> obtained from local quarries in the Runcorn, Weston, and Halton areas. Unless stated otherwise, the buildings (except the bridges and the water tower) are constructed in local red <b>sandstone</b> with slate roofs. Their locations {{can be found on}} the map of all coordinates.|$|E
5|$|Geologists {{classify}} {{the falls}} at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake falls descend {{in a series}} of small steps, forming waterfalls that are said to resemble a wedding cake. Within the park, this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation <b>sandstone.</b> In bridal-veil falls, the second type, water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a plunge pool in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and <b>sandstone</b> of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder caprock which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil falls drops is grey <b>sandstone.</b> The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool.|$|E
5|$|Granite {{intrusions}} {{are found}} in the parish of Barvas in west Lewis, and another forms the summit plateau of the mountain Roineabhal in Harris. The granite here is anorthosite, and is similar in composition to rocks found in the mountains of the Moon. There are relatively small outcrops of Triassic <b>sandstone</b> at Broad Bay near Stornoway. The Shiant Isles and St Kilda are formed from much later tertiary basalt and basalt and gabbros respectively. The <b>sandstone</b> at Broad Bay was once thought to be Torridonian or Old Red <b>Sandstone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Its {{rocks are}} {{composed}} of <b>sandstones</b> of the Adamantina Formation supported by more solid <b>sandstones</b> of the Marília Formation.|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{above-mentioned}} standard, the facies of the deposits {{in the study}} area were identified by observing 715.3  m of cores collected from 42 cored wells. In total, the black mudstones are 273.1  m, <b>sandstones</b> attributed to sandy debris flows are 354.5  m, turbidite <b>sandstones</b> are 65  m, and the <b>sandstones</b> attributed to sand slumping are 22.7  m. In terms of thickness, the 6 th and 7 th members of the Yanchang Formation are dominated by sandy debris flow <b>sandstones</b> followed by turbidite <b>sandstones.</b> The slump sand bodies are present in only a few wells.|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. Artisanal mine of <b>sandstones</b> {{especially}} in rural area are facing numerous challenges {{including the use}} of inadequate tools for the processing of <b>sandstones.</b> Since the current processing technique has limitations which consist of the use of hammer and chisels, {{there is a need to}} develop environmentally friendly and cost effective techniques for the processing of <b>sandstones.</b> In this project, six different <b>sandstones</b> samples (yellowish, blackish, reddish, greenish, greyish and whitish) from QwaQwa rural area were collected and characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and an optical microscope. In addition, physical properties of <b>sandstones</b> were also carried out including compressive strength, dielectric properties and water absorption. Furthermore <b>sandstones</b> samples were irradiated using multi- and single- mode microwave cavities to investigate the effect on the mineralogy of <b>sandstones.</b> The analysis of mineralogical change was carried out using XRD. Additionally a microwave multimode cavity was used to investigate the weight loss of <b>sandstones</b> after being irradiated. A microwave cavity was designed based on the characteristics of <b>sandstones</b> and it was simulated. A photovoltaic solar system was sized to power the microwave cutter. The experimental work was carried out on a laboratory scale. The XRD analysis revealed that quartz was the major mineral present in all <b>sandstones</b> which confirms that QwaQwa <b>sandstones</b> are quartz based <b>sandstones.</b> Feldspar minerals such as illite and albite were also found. Additional minerals were identified at trace level including glauconite, kaolonite, crysobalite and orthoclase. On the other hand, the XRD results of the irradiated samples using a single- and multi- mode cavity for 60 seconds revealed a strong presence of quartz which means no significant changes were observed. However, some minor overlapped peaks suspected to be muscovite (KAl 2 (Si 3 Al) O 10 (OH,F) 2) in three samples (blackish, greyish and yellowish) were noticed. XRF study showed that the chemical elements available in the six <b>sandstones</b> samples are: aluminium, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, sodium, phosphorus, silicon and titanium...|$|R
5|$|In 1993, the Badshahi Mosque in a {{tentative}} list as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2000, the marble inlay {{in the main}} prayer hall was repaired. In 2008, replacement work on the red <b>sandstone</b> tiles on the mosque's large courtyard was begun using red <b>sandstone</b> imported from the original Mughal source near Jaipur, in the Indian state of Rajasthan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the very}} {{northern}} {{reaches of the}} Briar Creek watershed, the bedrock {{is made up of}} <b>sandstone.</b> South of the <b>sandstone</b> layer, there is a section of the watershed where the bedrock is mudstone. In {{the central part of the}} watershed, the bedrock is siltstone. In the southern part of the watershed, the bedrock is mostly shale, including the part of the watershed in Berwick, which it has bedrock of calcerous shale. A small area north of Berwick has limestone bedrock.|$|E
5|$|Interbedded {{sedimentary}} rock makes up 93% {{of the surface}} rock in the Catawissa Creek watershed, while the remaining 7% is <b>sandstone.</b> South of Mainville, the Catawissa Creek river valley is made of red shale. There is also conglomerate, greenish-gray <b>sandstone,</b> olive-colored shale, and anthracite coal near Catawissa Creek.|$|E
50|$|The Usme Formation is {{subdivided}} into a lower sequence of shales with intercalated <b>sandstones</b> and an {{upper part of}} <b>sandstones</b> and conglomerates.|$|R

30|$|A {{previous}} study {{demonstrated that the}} gravity-flow <b>sandstones</b> of the Chang 6 to Chang 7 members mainly occur in {{the central part of}} the lake basin (Fu et al. 2010). Of the gravity-flow <b>sandstones,</b> the sandy-debris-flow <b>sandstones</b> are thicker and the reservoir quality is better. In addition, these <b>sandstones</b> directly cover the source rocks of the Chang 7 member. Therefore, a good source–reservoir assemblage has been formed, which is also a favorable pay zone for oil and gas exploration.|$|R
5|$|More {{efficient}} {{weapons would}} require less efficient initiators. This meant that less polonium would be required. At {{the time of}} <b>Sandstone,</b> the national stockpile of polonium-beryllium initiators consisted of 50 A-Class initiators, with more than 25 curies of polonium, and 13 B-Class initiators with 12 to 25 curies. During <b>Sandstone,</b> at least one test would be conducted with a B-Class initiator.|$|E
5|$|Next below {{these is}} the Mississippian Burgoon <b>Sandstone,</b> which is buff colored with shale, coal, and {{conglomerate}} inclusions. Below this is the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray <b>sandstone.</b> The lowest and oldest layer is the red shale and siltstone of the Catskill Formation, some 375million years old. This layer is relatively soft and easily eroded, which helped to form the Pine Creek Gorge. The source of Upper Pine Bottom Run is on Mauch Chunk rock, and the stream cuts deeper as it flows east to Pine Creek. In the park Upper Pine Bottom Run has cut through layers of Burgoon <b>sandstone</b> and Huntley Mountain rock, and downstream of the park to its mouth the deepest parts of the valleys are made of the Catskill Formation.|$|E
5|$|Next in the {{geologic}} {{column is}} the -thick Toroweap Formation (see 6c in figure 1). It consists {{of red and}} yellow <b>sandstone</b> and shaly gray limestone interbedded with gypsum. The formation was deposited in a warm, shallow sea as the shoreline transgressed (invaded) and regressed (retreated) over the land. The {{average age of the}} rock is about 273million years. In modern times it is a ledge- and slope-former that contains fossils of brachiopods, corals, and mollusks along with other animals and various terrestrial plants. The Toroweap is divided into the following three members: Seligman is a slope-forming yellowish to reddish <b>sandstone</b> and siltstone. Brady Canyon is a cliff-forming gray limestone with some chert. Wood Ranch is a slope-forming pale red and gray siltstone and dolomitic <b>sandstone.</b> An unconformity marks the top of this formation.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The lower Mineral Wells formation of the Pennsylvanian Strawn group is a siliciclastic-dominated sequence of cyclically interbedded mudstones, <b>sandstones.</b> and carbonates that was deposited in fluvial, deltaic, interdeltaic, and inner shelf environments during late Desmoinesian and early Missourian time. This study examined outcrops of the formation in Palo Pinto and Parker counties in north-central Texas for the purpose of describing and interpreting its facies, depositional environments, and stratigraphy. Eight depositional facies were identified in the lower Mineral Wells formation on the basis of lithology. sedimentary structures, and fossil content. The open marine facies is fossiliferous and consists of gray, beige, green, and brown mudstones, black mudstones with phosphate nodules, and limestones. The prodelta facies is largely nonfossiliferous and consists of massive mudstones, massive silty mudstones with occasional siltstone lenses, and horizontal planar-and lenticular-laminated muddy siltstones. The transgressive shoreface facies consists of cross-laminated and ripple laminated fine-grained <b>sandstones,</b> highly bioturbated fine-grained <b>sandstones,</b> very thinly-bedded very fine-grained <b>sandstones,</b> and sandy and silty mudstones. The interdistributary bay facies consists of massive clayey mudstones with some rippled very fine-grained <b>sandstones,</b> highly bioturbated sandy mudstones and muddy <b>sandstones,</b> and stratified very fine-to medium-grained <b>sandstones.</b> The swampmarsh facies consists of gray platy mudstones containing abundant plant fragments, red mudstones containing iron concretions, and dark gray mudstones containing plant fragments and mudcracks. The distributary channel facies consists of trough and tabular cross-laminated <b>sandstones,</b> wavy-bedded <b>sandstones,</b> and wavy-laminated and lenticular mudstones and <b>sandstones.</b> The meanderbeft facies consists of trough cross-bedded fine-grained <b>sandstones,</b> massive conglomerates, rippled very fine-to fine-grained <b>sandstones</b> interlayered with muddy <b>sandstones</b> and sandy mudstones, and horizontal planar-and cross-laminated fine-to medium-grained <b>sandstones</b> interlayered with cross-bedded and massive conglomerates. Lastly, the aggrading channel facies consists of large scale trough cross-bedded, wavy-bedded, and rippled medium-grained quartz <b>sandstones</b> and cherty pebble conglomerates. The stratigraphy of the lower Mineral Wells formation is characterized by alternating progradational and transgressive sequences. Progradational sequences typically consist of vertical successions from open marine to prodelta to distributary channel or interdistributary bay. Transgressive sequences consist of transgressive shoreface deposits overlain by increasingly deeper marine facies...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin and}} timing of {{siderite}} cementation have been constrained in relation to depositional facies and sequence stratigraphy of Upper Ordovician glaciogenic <b>sandstones</b> from the Murzuq basin, SW Libya. Optical microscope, backscattered electron imagery, and carbon and oxygen stable isotope analysis have revealed that siderite is of eo- and mesogenetic origin. Eogenetic siderite is Mg-poor with a mean composition of (Fe 91. 7 Mg 1. 5 Ca 0. 3 Mn 6. 5) CO 3, and occurs in paraglacial, tide-dominated deltaic highstand systems tract (HST) <b>sandstones,</b> in paraglacial, foreshore to shoreface HST <b>sandstones</b> and in postglacial, Gilbert-type deltaic lowstand systems tract (LST) <b>sandstones.</b> This siderite is typically of meteoric water origin that influxed into the LST and HST <b>sandstones</b> during relative sea level fall and basinward shift of the strandline. Mesogenetic siderite, which engulfs and thus postdates quartz overgrowths and illite, is Mg-rich with a mean composition of (Fe 72. 2 Mg 21. 7 Ca 0. 8 Mn 5. 3) CO 3 and occurs in the paraglacial, tide-dominated deltaic HST <b>sandstones,</b> in paraglacial foreshore to shoreface HST <b>sandstones,</b> in glacial, tide-dominated estuarine transgressive systems tract (TST) <b>sandstones,</b> in postglacial, Gilbert-type deltaic LST <b>sandstones,</b> and in postglacial, shoreface TST <b>sandstones.</b> δ 18 OV-PDB values of this siderite, which range between − 22. 6 and − 13. 8 ‰, suggest that precipitation has occurred from evolved formation waters with δ 18 O values between − 14. 0 and + 1. 0 ‰ and was either meteoric, mixed marine–meteoric and/or marine in origin by assuming postdating quartz overgrowths and illite temperature between 80 and 130 °C...|$|R
