40|$|A {{method of}} calculating the break surface {{formed as a}} result of {{blast-hole}} rings' <b>short-delay</b> <b>blasting</b> has been developed. The method is based on simulation modeling of a process of broken rock separation from rock mass. A modeling tool has been implemented {{as a part of the}} module for designing cave large-scale blasts included in MINEFRAME software package. It has been shown that the tool can evaluate possible outcomes of the project of cave large-scale blast properl...|$|E
40|$|The {{spectral}} {{assessment of}} the seismic effect of <b>short-delay</b> <b>blasting</b> of explosive charges was realized in this article. The problem of the superposition of seismic vibrations depending {{on the number of}} sources (charges) and time of their delay was considered. The relations of theoretical assessment of interference of seismic vibrations were established for a special case (when the system is described with respect to the same waves coming in a clear sequence of the observation point). ???????????? ???????????? ?????? ????????????? ??????? ??????????????????? ????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????. ??????????? ?????? ? ???????????? ???????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ?? ?????????? ??????????
