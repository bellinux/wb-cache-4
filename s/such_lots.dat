2500|$|In {{recent years}} Oakland city {{planning}} authorities have approved proposed residential mixed use development projects {{in this neighborhood}} {{in part because they}} are considered by some to be [...] "infill". In other words, they are [...] "filling in" [...] under-utilized [...] "vacant" [...] lots in an urbanized setting. Most all <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> have had daily commercial use such as surface parking for the neighborhood's drive-in workforce by day, and for some of the neighborhood's automobile driving residents and drive-in bar and restaurant patrons by night. One such vacant lot on 14th Street at Madison, directly adjacent to the boundaries of the neighborhood, is used as a preschool playground for several neighborhood children who attend the school, as it is within walking distance for their 'car-free' parents. A developer recently proposed a project for this particular lot which has been tentatively titled [...] "1301 Madison".|$|E

6000|$|ANNYS Last night? In the {{neighbourhood}} of Leicester Square till three o'clock. Oh, Geoff, there's <b>such</b> a <b>lot</b> wants altering! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None at all, mother. My {{correspondence}} is {{just the}} usual sort of rubbish--invitations and gossip. <b>Such</b> a <b>lot</b> of invitations, by-the-bye." ...|$|R
60|$|LOUIS. But {{you must}} have great {{influence}} with them. You must know <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> of things about them--private things that they wouldnt like to have known. They wouldnt dare to refuse you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Isobel. Then {{with another}} sudden change of voice she went on. [...] "Now {{tell me all}} about yourself, Godfrey. There must be <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> to say, and I long to hear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but I shall walk to Longpuddle {{church in}} the {{afternoon}} with father, and <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> of people {{will be looking at}} me there, you know; and it did set so badly round the neck." ...|$|E
60|$|SMITH: Well, perhaps, {{not quite}} so much as I might have done. <b>Such</b> a <b>lot</b> {{of things to do}} this term. Cricket, for instance.|$|R
60|$|FANNY [she {{shakes her}} head]. There's <b>such</b> a <b>lot</b> of mine. It has always {{hampered}} me, never {{being able to}} hit the happy medium.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could always}} spot {{them through the}} magic glass, father," [...] said Dick; [...] "it saves <b>such</b> a <b>lot</b> of trouble. I hate geography." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, the money-letters! Don't I {{know the}} feel of them--directed to master this and master that, and with a seal and a card, and half a sovereign, or maybe a whole one, under it; and <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> as they gets before the holidays--that's to go home, you see.' ...|$|E
60|$|LEO. But {{there are}} <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> of stupid women to marry. Why {{do they want}} to marry us? Besides, Rejjy knows that I'm quite fond of him. I like him because he wants me; and I like Sinjon because I want him. I feel that I have a duty to Rejjy.|$|E
6000|$|Logan rumpled his hair, 'Can't I get her {{to lunch}} at a {{restaurant}} and ply her with the wines of Eastern France? No, she is Temperance personified. Can't we send her a forged telegram to say that her mother is dying? Servants seem to have <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> of mothers, always inconveniently, or conveniently, moribund.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't it? Extra-ordinary, I call it. Never heard tell of Invisible Men before, I haven't, but {{nowadays}} {{one hears}} <b>such</b> a <b>lot</b> of extra-ordinary things--that--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I didn't feel much. I didn't {{know what}} to feel. Other folks did <b>such</b> a <b>lot</b> of feeling, I thought I'd better keep my mouth shut." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Nan dear, do come! You know <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> of swells. You {{would get}} one into real society {{if one is}} to have it; Lady Rotherwood, Lady Caergwent, besides all your {{delightful}} artist friends; and that would pacify mother, and make it so much pleasanter for me. Oh, if you knew what the evenings are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{called on}} the Trudhams yesterday," [...] he announced; [...] "it was their Silver Wedding, you know, at least the day before was. <b>Such</b> <b>lots</b> of silver presents, quite a show. Of course there were a great many duplicates, but still, very nice to have. I think they were very pleased to get so many." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> {{of things}} I {{should like to}} buy," [...] Evan said. [...] "I should like to buy mother a new Sunday bonnet, and I should like {{to get you a}} pound of bacca; and Winnie wants a new pair of boots and stockings, and there's lots of things I should like to get for Harry, and some warm gloves for Sue, and--and no end of things." ...|$|E

6000|$|Sager than in thy fortunes; for in them [...] Ambition steeled thee on to far too show [...] That just {{habitual}} scorn, {{which could}} contemn [...] Men and their thoughts; 'twas wise to feel, not so [...] To wear it ever on thy lip and brow, [...] And spurn the instruments thou wert to use [...] Till they were turned unto thine overthrow: [...] 'Tis but a worthless world to win or lose; So hath {{it proved to}} thee, and all <b>such</b> <b>lot</b> who choose.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah! I can't tell that. There are <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> {{of things}} going on now-a-days that a fellow can {{understand}} nothing about! But I've no doubt of this--if you were to tie her up with ropes ever so, I don't in the least doubt but what she'd get out." [...] Archie was awe-struck, and made two or three strokes after this but then he plucked up his courage and asked a question--"Where do you suppose they get it from, Doodles?" ...|$|E
60|$|On that night, {{as it may}} be imagined, {{the gates}} of the Castle of Cleves were not shut. Everybody was free to come in. Wine-butts were {{broached}} in all the courts; the pickled meat prepared in <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> for the siege was distributed among the people, who crowded to congratulate their beloved sovereign on his victory; and the Prince, as was customary with that good man, who never lost an opportunity of giving a dinner-party, had a splendid entertainment made ready for the upper classes, the whole concluding with a tasteful display of fireworks.|$|E
6000|$|Georgy never {{tired of}} his praises of the Major to his mother. [...] "I like him, Mamma, because he knows <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> of things; and he ain't like old Veal, who is always bragging and using such long words, don't you know? The chaps call him 'Longtail' at school. I gave him the name; ain't it capital? But Dob reads Latin like English, and French and that; and when we go out {{together}} he tells me stories about my Papa, and never about himself; though I heard Colonel Buckler, at Grandpapa's, {{say that he was}} one of the bravest officers in the army, and had distinguished himself ever so much. Grandpapa was quite surprised, and said, 'THAT feller! Why, I didn't think he could say Bo to a goose'--but I know he could, couldn't he, Mamma?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do {{you suppose}} I've been talking <b>such</b> a <b>lot?</b> Why do you imagine I snapped your poor, {{innocent}} head off just now! I'm terrified inside, terrified!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe God knows <b>such</b> a <b>lot</b> about Himself," [...] he cried. [...] "God doesn't KNOW things, He IS things. And I'm sure He's not soulful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] said Kipps, [...] "only there's <b>such</b> a <b>lot</b> {{of things}} I don't {{seem to be}} up to some'ow. That's where the trouble comes in." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{began at}} school that life of {{prudence}} and economy which I have carried on ever since. My mother gave me eighteenpence on setting out (poor soul! I thought her heart would break as she kissed me, and bade God bless me); and, besides, I {{had a small}} capital of my own which I had amassed for a year previous. I'll tell you, what I used to do. Wherever I saw six halfpence I took one. If it was asked for I said I had taken it and gave it back;--if it was not missed, I said nothing about it, as why should I?--those who don't miss their money, don't lose their money. So I had a little private fortune of three shillings, besides mother's eighteenpence. At school they called me the copper-merchant, I had <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> of it.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR FRIEND, - I {{have been}} so busy, away to Bridge Of Allan with my father first, and then with Simpson and Baxter out here from Saturday till Monday. I {{had no time to}} write, and, as it is, am strangely incapable. Thanks for your letter. I have been reading <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> of law, and it seems to take away the power of writing from me. From morning to night, so often as I have a spare moment, I am in the embrace of a law book - barren embraces. I am in good spirits; and my heart smites me as usual, when I am in good spirits, about my parents. If I get a bit dull, I am away to London without a scruple; but so long as my heart keeps up, I am all for my parents.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{can manage}} all that too. Look you here, John, how many half-worked trifles there are. The needle or the pencil is the {{resource}} of all distressed heroines, you know; and I promise you, though I {{have been a}} little idle and unsettled of late, yet, when I do set about it, no Emmeline or Ethelinde of them all ever sent such loads of trumpery to market as I shall, or made such wealth as I will do. I dare say Lady Penelope, and all the gentry at the Well, will purchase, and will raffle, and do all sort of things to encourage the pensive performer. I will send them <b>such</b> <b>lots</b> of landscapes with sap-green trees, and mazareen-blue rivers, and portraits that will terrify the originals themselves--and handkerchiefs and turbans, with needlework scallopped exactly like the walks on the Belvidere--Why, I shall become a little fortune in the first season." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the word, my wench," [...] replied her brother, lapsing {{into the}} dialect. [...] "That's what I'm after. We known <b>such</b> a <b>lot,</b> an' we known nöwt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh long ago"--Vanderbank eased him off. [...] "It's {{delightful}} of you," [...] this informant went on, [...] "to {{have known}} also <b>such</b> a <b>lot</b> of MY people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's {{many things}} enough, but is she, among them, rich enough?" [...] I demanded. [...] "Rich enough, I mean, to {{sacrifice}} <b>such</b> a <b>lot</b> of good money?" ...|$|R
