40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} is to explore inventory management decisions for ‘green’ pharmacies supply chains (SCs) defined by renewable chemical feedstock platform technologies. More specifically, we develop a System Dynamics (SD) modelling approach to investigate inventory planning and control operations of crude <b>sulphate</b> <b>turpentine,</b> {{as the source of}} renewable terpenoid feedstocks, and ‘green’ paracetamol, as the commercial medication, to support the design of SC operations for the emerging bio-based chemicals market. The applicability of the proposed simulation model is demonstrated through the case of the analgesics market in the United Kingdom to further inform the wider chemical and pharmaceutical communities about the untapped potential of using inexpensive terpenoid feedstocks as precursors for the sustainable synthesis of widely used medications. We adopt the SD methodology to capture the patients’ ecological awareness and provide an experimental simulation tool as the approach has been successful in studying the dynamic behaviour of complex supply networks. The study results allow for the exploration of different decisions for the management of renewable chemical feedstocks and ‘green’ pharmacies. This research has received funding from the EPSRC under Grant Reference No. EP/K 014889 / 1, Panel Name: “EPSRC Sustainable Chemical Feedstocks”, Project Full Title: “Terpene-based Manufacturing for Sustainable Chemical Feedstocks”, Project Duration: 2013 - 2018...|$|E
40|$|A major {{environmental}} concern {{with respect to}} hydrocarbon emissions is the formation of phytotoxic photooxidants. The work reported in this thesis focusses on the poorly studied anthropogenic terpene emissions from the industrial use of softwood. The advanced analytical determinations were made by adsorption sampling followed by thermal desorption and gas chromatography in the laboratory. Monoterpenes from forestry were analyzed for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Near to a harvester, the total monoterpene concentrations reached ~ 1000 mg/m 3, whereas the background level was ~ 1 mg/m 3. Prominent monoterpenes were a-pinene, b-pinene, 3 -carene, camphene, limonene, b-phellandrene, myrcene and terpinolene. Local formation of phytotoxic photooxidants may occur because of the short lifetimes of terpenes in air. Terpenes in process emissions and plumes from kraft pulp industries {{were found to have}} a uniform composition similar to that of pulpwood and of recovered <b>sulphate</b> <b>turpentine.</b> Predominant monoterpenes were a-pinene and 3 -carene from Scots pine. The emitted terpenes give rise to photooxidants and to oxidation of co-emitted sulphur and nitrogen oxides. The monoterpenes in emissions from industries producing stone groundwood and thermomechanical pulp were similar in composition to that of the processed pulpwood from Norway spruce. The major monoterpenes were a-pinene (> 50 %) and b-pinene (~ 25 %). The process emissions from a sulphite mill consisted mainly of p-cymene, formed from spruce monoterpenes by acid rearrangements. The terpene emissions from the barking of timber and pulpwood differed somewhat in composition from that of the wood. Increased proportions of b-phellandrene and myrcene were observed for Norway spruce. Oxidative decomposition and acid rearrangements of monoterpenes in the sampling cartridges were studied as major analytical difficulties. Pretreatment with thiosulphate and hydrogencarbonate prevented unwanted reactions of the terpenes...|$|E
40|$|As part of CSIR Biosciences’ {{interest}} in aroma chemicals, {{the processing of}} crude <b>sulphated</b> <b>turpentine</b> (CST) into high value aroma products was investigated. The primary target product, linalool, was obtained from a mixture of α- and β-pinene in four steps. It can {{be transformed into a}} wide range of high value added aroma chemicals. Isomerisation of linalool {{in the presence of a}} transition metal catalyst furnishes geraniol and nerol. The scientific work described in this report was part of a bigger project aimed at developing innovative processes to manufacture aroma, flavour & fragrance chemicals through beneficiation of industrial waste streams and other raw materials, available locally from the Forestry, Paper & Pulp industries. The evaluation of a process for the preparation of precursor aroma, flavour & fragrance compounds, in particular geraniol and nerol, from locally available raw materials and industrial waste streams, was investigated. Preparation of geraniol and nerol from linalool (ex α-pinene stream) was investigated using acids or organometallic complexes as catalysts for the corresponding isomerisation reaction. The investigation was conducted in an effort to find a less costly process utilising milder conditions than via the conventional cleavage of β-pinene to myrcene under extreme pyrolysis conditions (> 650 °C). The transformation of linalool to geraniol/nerol using mineral acids was found to be dominated by secondary reactions such as dehydration and cyclisation, resulting in poor product selectivities and yields. On the other hand, organometallic complexes, in particular vanadium-based complexes (e. g. (OV(OBu) 3) produced satisfactory results in the preliminary assessment (conversion of 79. 8 percent and selectivity of 98. 3 percent). A set of statistically designed experiments was carried out on the (VO(BuO) 3 + [(Bu) 4 N+]OH¯) catalyst system where three variables were tested, i. e. substrate concentration, temperature, and catalyst loading. The selected model for conversion was significant with the “Probability > F” being < 0. 0001. The most important contributing variable to the model for conversion was temperature i. e. 83. 9 percent. Temperature was still the most important variable for the selectivity response at 65. 0 percent contribution level. The response surface generated for the selectivity response was flat indicating a robust method within the parameter range selecte...|$|R
40|$|Linalool {{is a key}} {{intermediate}} for {{the production}} of important fragrance chemicals such as geraniol, nerol, geranial, and neral. Linalool can be produced via a two-step process from α-pinene which is a major component of crude <b>sulphated</b> <b>turpentine</b> (CST) a foul-smelling, volatile waste product of the pulp and paper industry. The key step in this process is the pyrolysis step which involves the isomerisation of cis- 2 -pinanol to linalool and requires high temperatures (600 - 650 °C) and is not very selective due to the decomposition of the product itself under these conditions. A client of the CSIR, Teubes Pty. Ltd., is a manufacturer of flavour and fragrance compounds for the local and international fragrance market and expressed an interest in producing linalool since the company would then gain access to other valuable fragrance chemicals via relatively simple processes. Earlier work conducted by AECI, R & D did not meet with much success since the selectivity to linalool was very poor and the process could hardly be deemed as scalable. The main objective of this project was therefore to develop a process for the selective isomerisation of cis- 2 -pinanol to linalool with minimum by-product formation and using process equipment that could be scaled to full-scale production. Since cis- 2 - pinanol could not be purchased in sufficient quantities for process development, a process had to be developed for the bench-scale preparation of kilogram quantities of cis- 2 -pinanol from α-pinene obtained from the client. Although this synthesis formed a minor part of this investigation, several process improvements and innovations were introduced to produce high quality cis- 2 -pinanol, in very good yields at kilogram scale. A major part of this investigation was the design and set up of a pyrolyis rig capable of operating at elevated temperatures (400 - 750 °C) for the evaluation of various process parameters. Various vaporizer, reactor, and condensation systems were evaluated for their ability to cope with the demanding conditions on a consistent basis. The initial part of the investigation was a screening exercise to evaluate various process parameters as well as solvents, materials of construction, catalysts, etc. A comprehensive statistical design was also conducted to determine the critical process parameters and the model obtained was used to predict the optimum conditions required for the preparation of in-specification product on a consistent basis. These conditions were used in the preparation of a 1 kg sample which was required by the client for market evaluation purposes. The use of a novel microreactor system was also evaluated for the pinanol pyrolysis reaction. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that a microreactor has been successfully used for this type of reaction in the Fragrance industry and a patent application is being filed by the CSIR. The kinetics of the reaction in both the tubular reactor system and the microreactor system was investigated. Computer modelling studies on both the systems were also conducted. The raw material cost to produce a kilogram of linalool is $ 1. 40. There is a significant margin of 60. 8 percent between the raw material cost of linalool and the current selling price ($ 3. 57 /kg). This clearly indicates that the project is potentially feasible from an economic point of view and we can now proceed with confidence to the next stage which is the engineering design, building and commissioning of the large scale pyrolysis rig. The rest of the process steps will be conducted on existing equipment currently present at the CSIR’s large scale facility (Imbiza in Isando, Gauteng) ...|$|R
