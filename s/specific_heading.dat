50|$|The MCP is {{so called}} because it {{contains}} controls that allow {{the crew of the}} aircraft to select which parts of the aircraft's flight are to be controlled automatically. In modern MCPs, there are many different modes of automation available. The MCP can be used to instruct the autopilot to hold a specific altitude, to change altitudes at a specific rate, to hold a <b>specific</b> <b>heading,</b> to turn to a new heading, to follow the directions of a flight management computer (FMC), and so on. The MCP is actually independent of the autopilot - it simply sets the mode in which the autopilot operates, but the autopilot itself (e.g., an AFDS) is a separate aircraft system. The MCP often interacts with both the AFDS or autopilot and the FMC(s).|$|E
50|$|A {{midway between}} fully {{automated}} flight and manual flying is Control Wheel Steering (CWS). Although {{going out of}} fashion in modern airliners as a stand-alone option, CWS is still a function on many aircraft today. Generally, an autopilot that is CWS equipped, has three positions being off, CWS and CMD. In CMD (Command) mode the autopilot has full control of the aircraft, and receives its input from either the heading /altitude setting, radio and navaids or the FMS (Flight Management System). In CWS mode, the pilot controls the autopilot through inputs on the yoke or the stick. These inputs are translated to a <b>specific</b> <b>heading</b> and attitude, which the autopilot will then hold until instructed to do otherwise. This provides stability in pitch and roll. Some aircraft employ a form of CWS even in manual mode, such as the MD-11 which uses a constant CWS in roll. In many ways, a modern Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft in Normal Law is always in CWS mode. The major difference is that in this system {{the limitations of the}} aircraft are guarded by the flight computer, and the pilot can not steer the aircraft past these limits.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates whether type of display (dot or wire frame) and {{direction}} of movement {{have an effect on}} a person's ability to actively maintain a <b>specific</b> <b>heading</b> angle. The questions addressed were: (1) does the magnitude of the heading angle errors differ in the two displays, (2) are some heading angles more difficult to maintain than others, and (3) does the magnitude of some errors differ as a function of display type {{and direction of}} movement. Differences between {{the results of this study}} and previous research are explained by methodological differences across the studies. Another factor that may be responsible for the difference between previous findings and those presented here is the type of graphics used to display the simulated motion. The physical characteristics of the display or the graphics engines that generate the scene have varied greatly across the studies. Analyses and diagrams are presented showing results of the study and the differences generated from previous studies on this subject...|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{filariasis}} {{has found}} a new impetus now that neglected tropical diseases have their own journal. However, some of the advances published in renowned international journals have completely ignored previous publications on the subject, particularly those in languages other than English. The rapid assessment procedure for loiasis and the mapping of lymphatic filariasis provide two perfect illustrations of this. This problem may seem a bit outdated, given that all "good authors" now publish exclusively in English. It certainly is outdated for most areas of medicine. But, surely, {{this should not be}} the case for neglected tropical diseases, for which certain long-standing findings are every bit as important as what may be presented as new discoveries.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we explore the use of {{location}} aware mobile devices for searching and browsing {{a large number of}} general and cultural heritage information repositories. Based on GPS positioning we can determine a user’s location and context, composed of physical nearby locations, historic events that have taken place there, artworks that were created at or inspired by those locations and artists that have lived or worked there. Based on a geolocation, the user has three levels of refinement: pointing to a <b>specific</b> <b>heading</b> and selection and facets and subfacets of cultural heritage objects. In our approach two types of knowledge are combined: general knowledge about geolocations and pointsof interest and specialized knowledge about a particular domain, i. e. cultural heritage. We use a number of Linked Open Data sources and a number of general sources from the cultural heritage domain (including Art and Architecture Thesaurus, Union List of Artist Names) as well as data from several Dutch cultural institutions. We show three concrete scenarios where a tourist accesses localized information on hisiPhone about the current environment, events, artworks or persons, whichare enriched by Linked Open Data sources. We show that Linked Open Data sources in isolation are currently too limited to provide interesting semantic information but combined {{with each other and with}} a number of other sources a really informative location-based service can be created. ...|$|E

40|$|The present study: (1) {{tested the}} {{importance}} of the retrosplenial cortex for learning a <b>specific</b> <b>heading</b> direction and distance and, (2) determined if lesion size could explain apparent inconsistencies in the results of different research groups. Dark agouti rats received either ‘complete’ cytotoxic retrosplenial cortex lesions or ‘standard’ lesions, the latter sparing the caudal retrosplenial cortex. Animals were first tested on two versions of a “landmark” task in a water maze. In condition 1 animals could use both heading direction and allocentric position, while in condition 2 only heading direction was effective. In condition 1, animals with complete retrosplenial lesions were impaired by the end of training, their profile of performance being consistent with a failure to use allocentric position information. When the water maze task changed (condition 2) so that allocentric cues became redundant, the animals with complete retrosplenial lesions were able to head in the appropriate direction although they showed longer swim paths. Subsequent testing in the radial-arm maze provided more evidence that retrosplenial lesions can disrupt the use of distal (allocentric) room cues. The impairments seen with retrosplenial lesions were often mild but throughout the study performance of rats with ‘complete’ lesions was more disrupted than those with ‘standard’ lesions, who often did not differ from the controls. These findings show that lesion size is a critical factor and may explain why some studies have failed to find comparable deficits after retrosplenial cortex lesions...|$|E
40|$|Current {{installation}} costs of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) {{are high and}} profit margins in the offshore wind energy sector are low, it is thus necessary to develop installation methods that are more efficient and practical. This paper presents a numerical study (based on a global response analysis of marine operations) of a novel procedure for installing the tower and Rotor Nacelle Assemblies (RNAs) on bottom-fixed foundations of OWTs. The installation procedure {{is based on the}} inverted pendulum principle. A cargo barge is used to transport the OWT assembly in a horizontal position to the site, and a medium-size Heavy Lift Vessel (HLV) is then employed to lift and up-end the OWT assembly using a special upending frame. The main advantage of this novel procedure is that the need for a huge HLV (in terms of lifting height and capacity) is eliminated. This novel method requires that the cargo barge is in the leeward side of the HLV (which can be positioned with the best heading) during the entire installation. This is to benefit from shielding effects of the HLV on the motions of the cargo barge, so the foundations need to be installed with a <b>specific</b> <b>heading</b> based on wave direction statistics of the site and a typical installation season. Following a systematic approach based on numerical simulations of actual operations, potential critical installation activities, corresponding critical events, and limiting (response) parameters are identified. In addition, operational limits for some of the limiting parameters are established in terms of allowable limits of sea states. Following a preliminary assessment of these operational limits, the duration of the entire operation, the equipment used, and weather- and water depth-sensitivity, this novel procedure is demonstrated to be viable...|$|E
