5|$|Lithium {{is useful}} in the {{treatment}} of bipolar disorder. Lithium salts may also be helpful for related diagnoses, such as <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder and cyclic major depression. The active part of these salts is the lithium ion Li+. They may increase the risk of developing Ebstein's cardiac anomaly in infants born to women who take lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Sheila's {{mental health}} {{continued}} to decline, with episodes of banging {{her head against}} walls. In 1983, her family doctor referred her to Dr. Hugh Ferguson, the psychiatrist who had treated June. Ferguson said she was in an agitated state, paranoid and psychotic. She was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital, a private psychiatric facility in Northampton, where {{she was diagnosed with}} <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder, although Ferguson said this diagnosis was a mistake and that she was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|If {{signs of}} {{disturbance}} are present {{for more than}} a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, while <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. If the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis secondary to that condition. Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present.|$|E

25|$|People with schizophrenia, <b>schizoaffective</b> {{disorder}} or {{bipolar disorder}} {{may have a}} predisposition to metabolic syndrome that is exacerbated by sedentary lifestyle, poor dietary habits, possible limited access to care, and antipsychotic drug-induced adverse effects. It {{has been found in}} Australia that 67% of patients with either bipolar disorder or <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder, and 51% of patients with schizophrenia meet criteria for metabolic syndrome; the prevalence is higher in women than in men.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Schizoaffective</b> {{spectrum}}. This spectrum {{refers to}} features of both psychosis (hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder etc.) and mood disorder (see below). The DSM has, {{on the one}} hand, a category of <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder (which may be more affective (mood) or more schizophrenic), {{and on the other}} hand psychotic bipolar disorder and psychotic depression categories. A spectrum approach joins these together, and may additionally include specific clinical variables and outcomes, which initial research suggested may not be particularly well captured by the different diagnostic categories except at the extremes.|$|E

25|$|Clozapine, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Clozaril among others, is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic medication. It is mainly used for schizophrenia that does not improve following the use of other antipsychotic medications. In those with schizophrenia and <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder it may decrease the rate of suicidal behavior. It {{is more effective than}} typical antipsychotics and effective for those who are treatment resistant. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Off-label uses {{include the}} {{treatment}} of peripheral neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, cluster headaches, migraines, and reducing neuropathic pain. Although a systematic review conducted in 2013 concluded that well-designed clinical trials have shown no benefit for lamotrigine in neuropathic pain. Off-label psychiatric usage includes {{the treatment of}} treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder, depersonalization disorder, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder, borderline personality disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In at least two cases, lamotrigine seemed efficacious for Kleine-Levin syndrome but caused no improvement {{in at least one}} case.|$|E
25|$|Douglas's only child, Raymond, was {{diagnosed}} with <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder in 1927, {{at the age of}} 24, and entered St Andrew's Hospital, a mental institution. He was decertified and discharged after five years, but suffered a subsequent breakdown and returned to the hospital. In February 1944, when his mother died of a cerebral haemorrhage at the age of 70, Raymond was able to attend her funeral and in June he was again decertified. However, his conduct rapidly deteriorated and he returned to St Andrew's in November where he stayed until his death on 10 October 1964. He had never married.|$|E
25|$|Tulisa {{was born}} on 13 July 1988 in Camden Town, London, to a Northern Irish mother Anne Byrne (who, with her three sisters, {{was a member of}} the 1980s band Jeep) and Greek Cypriot father Plato Contostavlos (who was at one time a member of Mungo Jerry). When Tulisa was five, her mother, who has bipolar {{disorder}} and <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. At age 14, with support from her uncle, Byron Contostavlos, N-Dubz's former manager, she enrolled at Quintin Kynaston School in St John's Wood but later attended Haverstock Secondary School where she did not sit her GCSE examinations.|$|E
25|$|Formally {{diagnosed}} as a <b>schizoaffective</b> with mild manic depression, Wilson experiences auditory hallucinations that presents {{itself in the}} form of disembodied voices. According to him, he began having hallucinations in 1965, shortly after starting to use psychedelic drugs. In recent years, Wilson's mental condition has improved, although he still has auditory hallucinations from time to time. His relationship with his wife and his new regimen of psychiatric care have allowed him to resume his career as a musician. In 1984, Wilson had been {{diagnosed as}} paranoid schizophrenic, with doctors finding evidence of brain damage caused by excessive and sustained drug abuse. The paranoid schizophrenic diagnosis, originally made by Landy, was later retracted.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine was {{synthesized}} in 1958 by Wander AG, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, {{based on}} the chemical structure of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. The first test in humans in 1962 was considered a failure. Trials in Germany in 1965 and 1966 {{as well as a}} trial in Vienna in 1966 were successful. In 1967 Wander AG was acquired by Sandoz. Further trials took place in 1972 when clozapine was released in Switzerland and Austria as Leponex. Two years later it was released in West Germany, and Finland in 1975. Early testing was performed in the United States around the same time. In 1975, after reports of agranulocytosis leading to death in some clozapine-treated patients, clozapine was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer. Clozapine fell out of favor {{for more than a decade}} despite unclear reasons for the agranulocytosis which occurred in Finland, the rate of which was 20 times higher than had been reported in any other country. However, when studies demonstrated that clozapine was more effective against treatment-resistant schizophrenia than other antipsychotics, the FDA and health authorities in most other countries approved its use only for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and required Restricted Distribution, a Patient Registry and regular hematological monitoring to detect granulocytopenia, before agranulocytosis develops. In December 2002, clozapine was approved in the US for reducing the risk of suicide in schizophrenic or <b>schizoaffective</b> patients judged to be at chronic risk for suicidal behavior. In 2005 FDA approved criteria to allow reduced blood monitoring frequency.|$|E
500|$|He {{graduated}} from Elk Grove High School in 1998, {{during which he}} was treated temporarily for mental illness at the Elk Grove Village Thresholds-Mary Hill House psychiatric center, for being [...] "unruly" [...] at home, according to his parents Gail and Robert Kazmierczak. He was diagnosed with <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder as a teenager. He later went on to study sociology at Northern Illinois University (NIU). Though {{his family moved to}} Florida in 2004, Kazmierczak continued his education in Illinois. He enlisted in the United States Army in September 2001, and was discharged before completing basic training in February 2002 for lying on his application about his mental illness. His mother died in Lakeland, Florida in September 2006 from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease). At the time of Steven's death, his father was living in a retirement community in Lakeland.|$|E

2500|$|Paraphrenia is not {{included}} in the DSM-5; psychiatrists often diagnose patients presenting with paraphrenia as having atypical psychoses, delusional disorder, psychoses not otherwise specified, <b>schizoaffective</b> disorders, and persistent persecutory states of older adults.

2500|$|In recent medicine, {{the term}} {{paraphrenia}} {{has been replaced}} by the diagnosis of [...] "very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis" [...] and has also been called [...] "atypical psychoses, delusional disorder, psychoses not otherwise specified, <b>schizoaffective</b> disorders, and persistent persecutory states of older adults" [...] by psychotherapists. Current studies, however, recognize the condition as [...] "a viable diagnostic entity that is distinct from schizophrenia, with organic factors playing a role in a significant portion of patients." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson is {{formally}} {{diagnosed with}} <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder and mild manic depression. In art, the word [...] "genius" [...] is usually attributed to creators {{known to be}} eccentric or tortured artists, and in Wilson's case, these elements {{are at the center}} of his mythology. It was in the 1970s when fans and detractors began referring to Wilson as a burned-out acid casualty, as biographer Peter Ames Carlin writes, his [...] "public suffering [...] transformed him from a musical figure into a cultural one." [...] In 1976, Wilson intimated: [...] "I am a victim of the recording industry. ... I thought I had talent. But I didn't think I was a genius." ...|$|E
2500|$|A single manic episode, in {{the absence}} of {{secondary}} causes, (i.e., substance use disorder, pharmacologic, general medical condition) is sufficient to diagnose bipolar I disorder. Hypomania may be indicative of bipolar II disorder. [...] Manic episodes are often complicated by delusions and/or hallucinations; should the psychotic features persist for a duration significantly longer than the episode of mania (two weeks or more), a diagnosis of <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder is more appropriate. Certain of [...] "obsessive-compulsive spectrum" [...] disorders as well as impulse control disorders share the name [...] "mania," [...] namely, kleptomania, pyromania, and trichotillomania. Despite the unfortunate association implied by the name, however, no connection exists between mania or bipolar disorder and these disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Bjelland {{was married}} and {{divorced}} twice and had a son, Henry (born 1999), with her second husband. In 2007 Bjelland had a schizophrenic episode and had received treatment. Bjelland commented on the event, saying: “I don’t know how I’ve progressed musically as such but a major influence in my writing was dealing with my whole schizophrenia episode. I actually haven’t spoken to anyone much about this. Dealing with multiple personalities was extremely difficult because some days I didn't know who I was or where I was at. I was very lucky that Adrian stuck by and helped me through it all. So obviously {{that was going to}} affect some of what I wrote about."

2500|$|Mania is a {{syndrome}} {{of multiple}} causes. Although {{the vast majority}} of cases occur in the context of bipolar disorder, it is a key component of other psychiatric disorders (as <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder, bipolar type) and may also occur secondary to various general medical conditions, as multiple sclerosis; certain medications, as prednisone; or certain substances of abuse, as cocaine or anabolic steroids. In current DSM-5 nomenclature, hypomanic episodes are separated from the more severe full manic episodes, which, in turn, are characterized as either mild, moderate, or severe, with specifiers with regard to certain symptomatic features (e.g. catatonia, psychosis). Mania, however, may be divided into three stages: hypomania, or stage I; acute mania, or stage II; and delirious mania, or stage III. This [...] "staging" [...] of a manic episode is, in particular, very useful from a descriptive and differential diagnostic point of view.|$|E
2500|$|The {{notion of}} telepathy is not {{dissimilar}} to two clinical concepts: delusions of thought insertion/removal. This similarity might explain how an individual {{might come to}} the conclusion that they were experiencing telepathy. Thought insertion/removal is a symptom of psychosis, particularly of schizophrenia, <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder or substance-induced psychosis. Psychiatric patients who experience this symptom falsely believe that some of their thoughts are not their own and that others (e.g., other people, aliens, demons or fallen angels, or conspiring intelligence agencies) are putting thoughts into their minds (thought insertion). Some patients feel as if thoughts are being taken out of their minds or deleted (thought removal). Along with other symptoms of psychosis, delusions of thought insertion may be reduced by antipsychotic medication. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists believe and empirical findings support the idea that people with schizotypy and [...] schizotypal personality disorder are particularly likely to believe in telepathy.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson is {{afflicted with}} <b>schizoaffective</b> {{disorder}} that presents {{itself in the}} form of disembodied voices (auditory hallucinations). The illness emerged a week after his first LSD consumption. It formed a major component of Bill Pohlad's Love & Mercy (2014), a biographical film which depicts Wilson's hallucinations as a source of musical inspiration, constructing songs that were partly designed to converse with them. Wilson has said of the voices: [...] "Mostly [...] derogatory. Some of it's cheerful. Most of it isn't." [...] He added that his hallucinations will inspire a song [...] "every now and then". In 2002, Wilson felt that his successful treatment initiated a writer's block: [...] "I haven't been able to write anything for three years. I think I need the demons in order to write, but the demons have gone. It bothers me a lot. I've tried and tried, but I just can't seem to find a melody." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{psychiatrist}} testimony followed. While Dahlgren {{remained silent}} when questioned by police, he had {{cooperated with the}} psychiatrist who commented that she had spent several times more time analyzing Dahlgren than any other person before. According to her, Dahlgren suffered by mixed personality disorder, however not {{to the extent to}} be declared mentally ill during the murders. [...] He had had a sexual relationship with male classmate during his time at high school, with sexual relationships with women afterwards. Dahlgren had claimed to like animals more than people. Before going to Brno, Dahlgren was contemplating going to Africa instead in order to kill poachers there. In Brno, he first felt fine, however later Mr. Harok Sr. started asking him to find a meaningful occupation, which meant {{that he was in the}} same position as back in the US. During repeated interviews with psychiatrist, Dahlgren had spoken about his [...] "internal voice" [...] that tells him what to do [...] "in order to become a hero". This, however, did not reach a state of psychosis: according to the psychiatrist a person in the state of psychosis would not be able to conduct the murders the manner they happened (over several hours, with bodies being dragged to the garage, covered, and with an attempt to burn the house). Defense attorney attacked the psychiatrist claiming that American specialists found that he is suffering from bipolar-type <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder. The psychiatrist refused that saying that she had spent more time with Dahlgren, collected much more data, and that also that Dahlgren had shown no symptoms of such disorder during his long-term pre-trial custody.|$|E
50|$|The DSM-IV <b>schizoaffective</b> {{diagnosis}} isn't stable {{over time}} either. An initial diagnosis of <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder during time spent at a psychiatric inpatient facility was stable at 6-month and 24-month follow ups for only 36% of patients. By comparison, diagnostic stability was 92% for schizophrenia, 83% for bipolar disorder and 74% for major depression. Most patients diagnosed with DSM-IV <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder are later diagnosed with a different disorder, and that disorder is more {{stable over time}} than the DSM-IV <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|In DSM-5 and ICD-10, <b>schizoaffective</b> {{disorder}} {{is in the}} same diagnostic class as schizophrenia, but not in the same class as mood disorders. The diagnosis was introduced in 1933, and its definition was slightly changed in the DSM-5, published in May 2013, because the DSM-IV <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder definition leads to excessive misdiagnosis. The changes made to the <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder definition were intended to make the DSM-5 diagnosis more consistent (or reliable), and to substantially reduce the use of the diagnosis. Additionally, the DSM-5 <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder diagnosis can no longer be used for first episode psychosis.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2009, Carpenter and the DSM-5 <b>schizoaffective</b> {{disorder}} workgroup {{reported that}} they were [...] "developing new criteria for <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder to improve reliability and face validity," [...] and were [...] "determining whether the dimensional assessment of mood would justify a recommendation to drop <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder as a diagnostic category." [...] Speaking to an audience at the May 2009 annual conference of the American Psychiatric Association, Carpenter said:We had hoped to get rid of DSM-IV <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder as a diagnostic category because we don't think it's a valid entity and we don't think it's reliable. On the other hand, we think it's absolutely indispensable to clinical practice.|$|E
5000|$|The DSM-5 <b>schizoaffective</b> {{disorder}} workgroup analyzed all of {{the available}} research evidence on <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder, and concluded that [...] "presenting symptoms of psychosis have little validity in determining diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment response." [...] Given our understanding of overlapping genetics in bipolar disorders, <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder, and schizophrenia, {{as well as the}} overlap in treatments for these disorders; but given the lack of specificity of presenting symptoms for determining diagnosis, prognosis or treatment response in these psychotic illness syndromes, the limits of our knowledge are clearer: Presenting symptoms of psychosis describe only presenting symptoms to be treated, and not much more. <b>Schizoaffective</b> disorder was changed to a longitudinal or life course diagnosis in DSM-5 for this reason.|$|E
50|$|The American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV {{criteria}} for <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder persisted for 19 years (1994-2013). Clinicians adequately trained in diagnosis used the <b>schizoaffective</b> diagnosis too often, {{largely because the}} criteria were poorly defined, ambiguous, and hard to use (or poorly operationalized). Poorly trained clinicians used the diagnosis without making necessary exclusions of common causes of psychosis, including some prescribed psychiatric medications. Specialty books written by experts on <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder have existed for over eight years before DSM-5 describing the overuse of the diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{historical}} clinical {{observation that}} <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder is an overlap of schizophrenia and mood disorders {{is explained by}} genes for both illnesses being present in individuals with <b>schizoaffective</b> disorder; specifically, recent research shows that schizophrenia and mood disorders share common genes and polygenic variations.|$|E
