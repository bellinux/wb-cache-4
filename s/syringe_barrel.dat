There {{are a number of}} systems for gauging needles, including the Stubs Needle Gauge and the French Catheter Scale. Needles in common medical use range from 7 gauge (the largest) to 33 (the smallest) on the Stubs scale. 21-gauge needles are most commonly used for drawing blood for testing purposes, and 16- or 17-gauge needles are most commonly used for blood donation, as the resulting lower pressure is less harmful to red blood cells (it also allows more blood to be collected in a shorter time). Although reusable needles remain useful for some scientific applications, disposable needles are far more common in medicine. Disposable needles are embedded in a plastic or aluminium hub that attaches to the <b>syringe</b> <b>barrel</b> by means of a press-fit or twist-on fitting.

With manual sampling, additional personnel are often not available to sample multiple sites within a narrow time interval. The objectives were to construct an automatic gas sampler and to compare the accuracy and precision of automatic versus manual sampling. The automatic sampler was tested with carbon dioxide (CO 2) fluxes that mimicked the range of CO 2 fluxes during a typical corn-growing season in eastern Nebraska. Gas samples were drawn from the chamber at 0, 5, and 10 min manually and with the automatic sampler. The three samples drawn with the automatic sampler were transferred to pre-vacuumed vials after 1 h; thus the samples in <b>syringe</b> <b>barrels</b> stayed connected with the increasing CO 2 concentration in the chamber.

2500|$|Metabolic chambers: Chambers may be {{glass jars}} with rubber {{stoppers}} for lids; <b>syringe</b> <b>barrels</b> for small animals and insects; or constructed from Plexiglas. Ideally, chambers should be constructed from inert materials; for example, the acrylic plastics can absorb O2 {{and may be}} a poor choice for respirometry with very small insects. Chambers need to be constructed {{in a manner that}} yields rapid mixing of gases within the chamber. [...] The simplest metabolic chamber for a small vertebrate might be a glass jar with a stopper. [...] The stoppers are fitted with two ports: short extensions of Teflon tubing are provided for line connections. Teflon tube extensions are pushed through the bulkhead and the line connection is finished by attaching a small hose clip {{to the base of the}} Teflon tube extension. Additionally, an extension to the inlet port inside the jar should be provided—this ensures that the animal's expiratory gases are not washed away by the in flow stream. The animal is sealed inside and the rubber stopper is held in place with Velcro straps. If an upstream system is used, any metabolic chamber leak will result in loss of animal air and, therefore, an underestimate of the animal's metabolic rate. When you close an animal inside a metabolic chamber, attention must be paid to the seal. To ensure tight seals before closing the lid, firmly work the stopper into the jar and make sure that it is even. Use 1-2 straps (2 are better) and pull tightly. Acrylic (Plexiglas) chambers will be constructed for some uses, but precise engineering will be needed to ensure proper seating; gaskets will help, and judicious use of tight-fitting clamps will minimize leaks.|$|R

40|$|A new {{simultaneous}} derivatization and extraction {{method for}} the preconcentration of ammonia using new one-step headspace dynamic in-syringe liquid-phase microextraction with in situ derivatization {{was developed for}} the trace determination of ammonium in aqueous samples by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC–FLD). The acceptor phase (as derivatization reagent) containing ophthaldehyde and sodium sulfite was held within a <b>syringe</b> <b>barrel</b> and immersed in the headspace of sample container. The gaseous ammonia from the alkalized aqueous sample formed a stable isoindole derivative with the acceptor phase inside the <b>syringe</b> <b>barrel</b> through the reciprocated movements of plunger. After derivatization-cum-extraction, the acceptor phase was directly injected into LC–FLD for analysis. Parameters affecting the ammonia evolution and the extraction/derivatization efficiency such as sample matrix, pH, temperature, sampling time, and the composition of derivatization reagent, reaction temperature, and frequency of reciprocated plunger, were studied thoroughly. Results indicated that the maximum extraction efficiency was obtained by using 100 L derivatization reagent in a 1 -mL gastight syringe under 8 reciprocated movements of plunger per min to extract ammonia evolved from a 20 mL alkalized aqueous solution at 70 ◦C (preheated 4 min) with 380 rpm stirring for 8 min. The detection was linear in the concentration range of 0. 625 – 10 M with the correlation coefficient of 0. 9967 and detection limit of 0. 33 M (5. 6 ng mL− 1) based on S N− 1 = 3.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{increase}} understanding of the mechanism and dominant drivers influencing phase separation during ram extrusion of calcium phosphate (CaP) paste for orthopaedic applications. The liquid content of extrudate was determined, and the flow of liquid and powder phases within the <b>syringe</b> <b>barrel</b> during extrusion were observed, subject to various extrusion parameters. Increasing the initial liquid-to-powder mass ratio, LPR, (0. 4 – 0. 45), plunger rate (5 – 20 mm/min), and tapering the barrel exit (45 °– 90 °) significantly reduced the extent of phase separation. Phase separation values ranged from (6. 22 ± 0. 69 to 18. 94 ± 0. 69 %). However altering needle geometry had no significant effect on phase separation. From powder tracing and liquid content determination, static zones of powder and a non-uniform liquid distribution was observed within the barrel. Measurements of extrudate and paste LPR within the barrel indicated that extrudate LPR remained constant during extrusion, while LPR of paste within the barrel decreased steadily. These observations indicate the mechanism of phase separation was located within the <b>syringe</b> <b>barrel.</b> Therefore phase separation can be attributed to either; (1) the liquid being forced downstream by an increase in pore pressure as a result of powder consolidation due to the pressure exerted by the plunger or (2) the liquid being drawn from paste within the barrel, due to suction, driven by dilation of the solids matrix at the barrel exit. Differentiating between these two mechanisms is difficult; however results obtained suggest that suction is the dominant phase separation mechanism occurring during extrusion of CaP paste.

Silicone spiking studies followed by exposure to agitation stress or accelerated temperature conditions were used to check for incompatibilities of the mAb with silicone oil, a necessary product contact material in PFS. In addition, screening studies to compare various closure materials as well as <b>syringe</b> <b>barrel</b> processing methods were used to select the optimum closure materials as well as the correct syringe processing method. Results indicate that the model mAb formulation used was sensitive to high levels of silicone oil especially under accelerated temperature conditions resulting in formation of protein–silicone particles in the solution for samples that were spiked with the silicone oil. Agitation stress did not have any significant impact on the quality attributes tested. Samples stored in syringe barrels that were processed with sprayed-on silicone had higher levels of subvisible particles as compared to those that were processed with the baked-on process.

The interview, performed at recruitment, {{consisted of}} the clinician reading the questionnaire and asking the patient whether the description matched their pain characteristics in the preceding week. This session was followed by a bedside examination for any sensory dysfunction and specifically for allodynia and for altered pinprick threshold (PPT). Allodynia was judged to be present when pain was elicited by the gentle stroke of a piece of cotton over the painful area in comparison with a nonpainful area. PPT was determined by comparing the response to a 23 -gauge needle mounted inside a 2 -mL <b>syringe</b> <b>barrel</b> placed onto the skin in nonpainful and then painful areas several times. PPT was defined as a sharp sensation in relation to gentle needle placement in a painful area.

Methods: The extent of adhesion was documented in 216 patient procedures and evaluated in detail in an additional 73 patient procedures. We evaluated the nature of the adhesion and its possible causes, including the location of adhesion in injection sets, the effect of syringe type, and the effect of prerinsing of syringes with various solutions of non-radiolabeled sestamibi and 99 mTc-sestamibi. The extent of ad-hesion was reevaluated in 50 procedures performed using the syringe type that demonstrated the lowest adhesion rate. Results: The degree of adhesion of 99 mTc-sestamibi to the in-jection set was found to be 20. 1 % 6 8. 0 %, with a range (10 th– 90 th percentiles) of 9 %– 31 %. The primary cause of adhesion appeared to be the lubricant used inside the <b>syringe</b> <b>barrel.</b> Evaluation of 6 different syringe types identified a brand with a lower adhesion rate. Reevaluation in patient procedures us-ing this brand showed a 5. 2 % 6 2. 5 % degree of adhesion, with a range (10 th– 90 th percentiles) of 2. 5 %– 7. 7 %. Conclusion: Se-lection of the appropriate type of syringe can significantly reduce the magnitude and variability of residual 99 mTc-sestamibi activ-ity. With more reproducible residual activities, we have been able to achieve an approximately 20 % reduction in the dis-pensed dose of 99 mTc-sestamibi used in clinical procedures and a more consistent injected dose with less interpatient variation. The frequent changes in syringe design by manufacturers require that a quality control program for monitoring of residual activity be incorporated into clinical practice.

40|$|Excessive water {{formation}} {{inside the}} polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell’s structures {{leads to the}} flooding of the cathode gas diffusion layer (GDL) and cathode gas flow channels. This results in {{a negative impact on}} water management and the overall cell performance. Liquid water generated in the cathode catalyst layer and the water moved from anode to cathode side due to electro-osmotic drag transport through the GDL to reach the gas flow field channels, where it is removed by air cathode gas stream. Due to high and uniform capillary force distribution effect of the pores through the GDL plane and surface tension between the water droplets and gas flow field channels surfaces, liquid water tends to block/fill the pores of the GDL and stick {{to the surface of the}} GDL and gas flow channels. Therefore, it is difficult to remove the trapped water in GDL structure which can lead to flood of the PEM fuel cell. The GDL surfaces are commonly treated uniformly with a hydrophobic material in order to overcome the flooding phenomena inside PEM fuel cell. Despite the importance impact of the surface wettability of both channel and GDL surface characteristics especially for the cathode side on the water management, few experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of the two-phase flow in cathode gas flow channel and their crucial role. The work presented in this thesis covers contributions that provide insight, not only into the investigation of the effects of hydrophobic cathode GDL and cathode gas flow channels, on water removal, two phase flow inside the channel, and on PEM fuel cell performance, but also the superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic GDLs and gas flow channels effects. Further, the effects of a novel GDL designs with sandwich and gradient wettability with driving capillary force through GDL plane have been investigated. Two-phase flow especially in the cathode gas flow field channels of PEM fuel cell has a crucial role on water removal. Hence, in this research, ex-situ investigations of the effects of channels with different surface wettability; superhydrophobic, hydrophobic, slightly hydrophobic, and superhydrophilic on the two-phase flow characteristics have been tested and visualized at room temperature. Pressure drop measurements and two-phase flow visualization have been carried out using high speed camera. The effect of the various coating materials on graphite and GDL surface morphology, roughness, static contact angle (θ), and sliding contact angle (α) have been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Profilometry, and sessile drop technique, respectively. It has been observed that the two-phase flow resistance is considerably affected by surface wettability of the channels. Further, the overall cell performance can be improved by superhydrophobic gas flow channels mainly at high current density over slightly hydrophobic and superhydrophilic cases tested. In addition, sandwich wettability GDL has been coated with a silica particle/ Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite. The porometric characteristics have been studied using, method of standard porosimetry (MSP). It has been found that sandwich wettability GDL has superhydrophobic surfaces with (θ = 162 ± 2 °), (α = 5 ± 1 °), and the internal pores are hydrophilic, while the mean pore radius is 7. 1 μm. This shows a low resistance to gas transport. On the other hand, performance testing indicates that (PEM) fuel cell equipped with sandwich wettability GDL results in the best performance compared to those with raw (non-coated) (slightly hydrophobic), PTFE coated (commercial with micro-porous layer (MPL)) (superhydrophobic), and silica coated (superhydrophilic) GDL. The wettability gradient has been introduced through plane of the one side hydrophobic GDL by coating one side of non-coated GDL with 15 wt. % of PTFE solution; however, the other side remains uncoated. The effects of wettability gradient on the water removal rate, droplet dynamics, and PEM fuel cell performance have been covered in this thesis. Water removal rate is determined using a 20 ml <b>syringe</b> <b>barrel,</b> wherein a 13 mm diameter GDL token is fixed on the barrel opening.

However, the insertion of the transition metal is strictly restricted to the ortho-C–H bond through a six- or seven-membered cyclic pre-transition state (TS). Although many strategies have been developed to selectively functionalize meta- and para-C–H bonds (2 – 4), this newly developed template approach overcomes the intrinsic steric and electronic bias of the substrates, and allows for the activation of remote C–H bonds. ### Reagents 1.

On the same piece of weighing paper, weigh all the solids. Weigh the substrate (0. 10 mmol) first, followed by Pd(OPiv) 2 (3. 0 mg, 0. 010 mmol, 0. 10 equiv.) and AgOPiv (62. 7 mg, 0. 30 mmol, 3. 0 equiv.). The solids were carefully transferred into the bottom of a 15 mL pressure vessel equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar. - Add ethyl acrylate (16. 5 µL, 0. 15 mmol, 1. 5 equiv.) to the solid mixture. - Wash down the solids on the sides of wall with 1, 2 -dichloroethane (1. 0 mL). - Cap the tube and submerge it into a pre-heated 90 °C (controlled by a digital temperature probe) oil bath. - Cover the tube and oil bath with aluminum foil and leave the reaction stirring for a total of 42 – 48 hours. - Lift vessel out of the oil bath and submerge it into ice bath for 10 minutes. - Filter the reaction mixture through a short pad of Celite® into a scintillation vial and wash the tube and Celite® pad three times with 2 mL of diethyl ether. Evaporate the solvent to dryness using a rotary evaporator. - Purify the desired product by preparative silica gel thin-layer chromatography eluting with hexane:ethyl acetate to yield the desired olefinated product. **Hydrocinnamic acid derivatives** 1. On the same piece of weighing paper, weigh all the solids sequentially as followed: Pd(OAc) 2 (2. 3 mg, 0. 010 mmol, 10 mol%), Ac-Gly-OH (2. 4 mg, 0. 020 mmol, 20 mol%), AgOAc (50 mg, 0. 30 mmol, 3. 0 equiv.) and the substrate (0. 10 mmol). The solids were carefully transferred into the bottom of a 35 mL pressure vessel pre-equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar. - HFIP (1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 -Hexafluoro- 2 -propanol) (0. 60 mL) was added to the mixture to wash down the solids on the sides of wall, followed by ethyl acrylate (22 µL, 2. 0 equiv.) and then another 0. 60 mL of HFIP. - Cap the tube tightly and submerge it into a pre-heated 90 °C (controlled by a digital temperature probe) oil bath. - Leave the reaction stirring for 24 hours. - Lift vessel out of the oil bath and filtrate the reaction mixture through a short pad of Celite® into a 50 ml round bottom flask after it cools down. - Evaporate the solvent to dryness using a rotary evaporator. - Isolate the desired product by preparative silica gel thin-layer chromatography eluting with hexane:ethyl acetate to yield the desired olefinated product. ### Timing - Toluene derivatives: 42 hours (electron-donating substituents); 48 hours (electron-withdrawing substituents) - Hydrocinnamic acid derivatives: 24 hours ### Troubleshooting - Toluene derivatives - Poor separation of the major meta-isomer from the minor isomers: Preparative thin-layer chromatography is usually the first choice to achieve better separation. Repetitive running of the thin-layer chromatography using less polar eluent is recommended to achieve good resolution. - Hydrocinnamic acid derivatives - Problem: Poor separation of mono-olefinated meta-isomer from the di-olefinated meta-isomer (when applicable), and poor separation of the major meta-isomer from the trace minor isomers for some substrates. - Solutions: Especially for those substrates with di-olefinated product, preparative thin-layer chromatography is usually employed to achieve better separation. Repetitive developing of the thin-layer chromatography (3 to 5 times) using relative less polar eluent is recommended. ### Anticipated Results Typical isolated yield of toluene derivatives should be 46 – 98 % depending on the substituents on the aromatic ring and olefins used. Typical yield of hydrocinnamic acid derivatives should be 67 – 93 % depending on the substituents on the aromatic ring. Longer reaction time than 24 hours may lead to more di-olefinated products; however, shorter reaction time could cause incomplete reaction. ### References 1. Engle, K.
