Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, {{with the exception of the}} Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass <b>spent</b> <b>air</b> out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family.|$|E

40|$|This {{two-phase}} study {{deals with}} the phenomenon of “stealth advertising” in Canada. This concept refers to the encroachment of commercially tinted messages into broadcast news segments. Different theories of commercial speech were used as a theoretical framework. The study combined mixed methods, content analysis and in-depth interviews. The first phase concentrated on the frequency and actual time <b>spent</b> <b>airing</b> commercially influenced messages in television newscast segments. The sample consisted of eight randomly selected English-language markets across Canada including news stations affiliated with CBC, CTV and Global. Seventy-five newscasts were recorded and content-analyzed. The analysis demonstrated that private television stations used more explicit and aggressive stealth advertising than publicly owned ones. In subsequent interviews, the news directors and sales managers {{of some of these}} stations denied that they yield to outside commercial pressures but admitted they may include messages with commercial content if these have public interest value. In the second phase thirty-nine newscasts of a news station affiliated with Global were recorded and content-analyzed, showing high numbers of commercially influenced messages and corroborating previous research findings. Subsequent interviews showed some news decision-makers accept the inclusion of commercially tinted news segments, thus eroding the divide between editorial and commercial contents. This study is intended to contribute to the empirical basis for pursuing the question of corruption of news by surreptitious commercial content...|$|R

40|$|Composting {{has become}} {{increasingly}} popular {{in the past decade}} as a biological treatment process of organic solid wastes, generated from different sources, with the purpose of recovery, stabilization and volume reduction of waste material in the form of compost. In this study, the effect of different modes of aeration on composting of solid waste using two heat insulated closed pilot-scale reactors was investigated. The modes of aeration studied were upflow, downflow, alternate upflow/downflow, and internal recirculation in a single-reactor system as well as reuse of <b>spent</b> <b>air</b> in a two-reactor system in series. Composting tests were performed in two stages of 20 - 30 days duration each. Temperature at different heights of the composting mass as well as air velocity were continuously monitored by a datalogger. Air flow was continuous or intermittent depending on temperature. Oxygen content in the <b>spent</b> <b>air</b> was regularly measured. The results show that (i) the application of unidirectional upflow or downflow aeration creates significant vertical distribution of temperature in the composting mass; and (ii) internal recirculation of air in a single-reactor system and reuse of <b>spent</b> <b>air</b> in a two-reactor system appeared to achieve a more uniform temperature distribution and thereby accelerated degradation of the organic matter.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} during {{materials processing}} and manufacturing is enhanced through jet impingement for many different applications including, the tempering and shaping of glass, the annealing {{of metal and}} plastic sheets, and the drying of textiles, veneer, paper, and film materials. Literature studies have examined average convective coefficients for jet arrays, but {{the understanding of the}} observed trends in the average transport coefficients and local effects are limited. Therefore, the physical mechanisms of impinging gaseous jets that affect the heat transfer characteristics were investigated. A liquid crystal technique was developed to measure local and average convective coefficients for impinging air jets, and the effects of separation distance, jet-to-jet spacing in an array, Reynolds number, and <b>spent</b> <b>air</b> exits were examined. ^ Small separation distances, H/D < 1, were found to significantly enhance the local and average convective coefficients for both single and multiple jet systems. Besides the presence of local secondary maxima situated in rings around the stagnation point of an individual jet, the dominant physical mechanism which influences the heat transfer coefficient and separation distance relationship for jet arrays is adjacent jet interference before impingement. Thus interference before impingement is minimized by using small separation distances. ^ The array jet-to-jet spacing was found to significantly affect the uniformity and magnitude of the average convective coefficient by varying the percentage of impingement surface area covered by the stagnation and wall jet regions. The larger percent area covered by the stagnation region with high local convective coefficients (smaller jet-to-jet spacing) resulted in higher average and more uniform local values. However, on an equivalent mass flux basis the larger jet-to-jet spacing was most efficient in cooling the impingement surface. ^ For small separation distances the Reynolds number was found to have a strong influence on the convective coefficient by increasing the size and magnitude of the secondary maxima in the local coefficient distributions. <b>Spent</b> <b>air</b> exits resulted in reduced wall jet interactions between adjacent jets and a more uniform coverage of the impingement surface. The elimination of crossflow is the main benefit of <b>spent</b> <b>air</b> exits for all but small separation distances. ...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Thermal anti-icing systems are commonly used to protect aircraft leading edges from a potentially hazardous build-up of ice. Such systems have proven reliable in service and are relatively cheap and efficient. Typically, hot air is tapped from the engine compressor and ducted (via a regulation and control system) to the surface to be protected. Ideally an optimisation process should be employed {{at the design stage}} in order to ensure adequate anti-icing capability with minimal use of engine bleed air, since the latter represents a performance penalty. Following submission by the author of an MSc thesis concerning thermal modelling of a hot air anti-icing system for a civil turbofan intake (Wade 67), it became clear that extension of the studies was necessary to enable systematic accounting of the factors which limit ice accretion. An experimental programme was therefore carried out to investigate primarily: various exhaust geometries (through which <b>spent</b> anti-icing <b>air</b> is emitted to join the main engine inlet airflow and provide heating of the downstream surface; various cowl internal configurations on a full-scale model section of a large civil turbofan Nose Cowl. The internal geometry affects the effectiveness of the cowl lipskin heating, and the <b>spent</b> anti-icing exhaust <b>air</b> limits the quantity of unevaporated water which runs back along the intake acoustic surface downstream of the directly heated area and freezes. The Computational Fluid Dynamics package PACE (Prediction of Aerodynamics and Combustor Emissions) was used to model the internal, freestream and exhaust airf lows to determine the program's potential and usefulness for predictive purposes in this type of application. PACE is capable of modelling two or three dimensional, recirculating or non-recirculating flows for simple rectangular or polar geometry. It encompasses a suite of sub-programs to generate meshes and to create and solve the set of coupled linear equations representing the fluid flow. Various parameters, including heat transfer coefficients, were predicted in two regions: downstream of the exhaust plane to model the mixing of the <b>spent</b> anti-icing <b>air</b> and the freestream main engine inlet flow; inside and outside the Nose Cowl highlight area to predict skin temperature distributions for the three internal geometry configurations tested. This thesis describes the experimental work and compares the results with the Computational Fluid Dynamics predictions. Agreement was generally found to be good, and it was concluded that PACE may provide a useful modelling (design) tool, albeit with some reservations...|$|R
