40|$|In this paper, we {{assess the}} hedging {{performance}} of the newly established CSI 300 stock index futures over some <b>short</b> <b>hedging</b> horizons. We use wavelet analysis as well as conventional models (na&iuml;ve, ordinary least squares, and error-correction) to compute the constant hedge ratios. The constant conditional correlation (CCC) and dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) bivariate generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (BGARCH) specifications are employed to calculate the time-varying hedge ratios.

Among the constant hedge ratio models, the wavelet analysis yields the best in-sample hedging performance, though its out-of-sample hedging performance is similar to other models. Comparing the time-varying ratio models, the CCC BGARCH model is better in terms of in-sample hedging effectiveness while for out-of-sample hedging performance, the DCC model is better with <b>short</b> <b>hedging</b> horizons and CCC model is more favourable with long hedging horizons.

40|$|Hedging {{can be a}} {{valuable}} tool to minimize price uncertainty for producers. There {{are two types of}} hedges producers may use, a <b>short</b> <b>hedge</b> and a long hedge. Short hedges are used to lock in a net selling price when prices are expected to fall, while a long hedge is used to lock in a buying price when prices are expected to rise for a commodity that is bought and used as an input. A <b>short</b> <b>hedge</b> is initiated by selling a contract on the futures market. The contract is generally bought back close to the time the contracted commodity is sold in the cash market. If the futures contract value decreases, money is made on the transaction. If the futures contract increases in value as time passes, money is lost on the transaction. The resulting gain/loss on the futures contract transactions offset changes in the cash market due to price changes for the commodity, resulting in the net amount paid or received being close to the expected price. The reason this works in deferring risk is that movements in the cash price generally reflect the futures price, with the difference defined as the basis. If basis behaves in a normal way, the actual payoff or net price received will be the same as the expected price. A long hedge is the reciprocal of the <b>short</b> <b>hedge.</b> A long hedge is initiated to protect the producer from the expectation of rising costs...|$|E

Verificou-se que há oportunidades de ganho tanto para hedgers de venda quanto de compra, porém as oportunidades de estratégias de hedge de compra são poucas e a lucratividade é ainda menor, em relação às estratégias de hedge de venda. Além disso, os contratos futuros com vencimento em março e maio apresentaram os maiores riscos de base devido ao fato de se ter maiores incertezas nos meses que antecedem a nova safra. Verificou-se, ainda, que o fortalecimento da base não é diretamente proporcional ao risco de base, predominando casos em que maior rentabilidade é acompanhada por menor risco, e vice-versa. Por fim, contatou-se que as maiores rentabilidades com operações de hedge de venda ocorrem com operações iniciadas no segundo semestre do ano.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 In 1970, the Pacific Northwest (PNW) {{produced}} approximately 145, 332, 000 {{bushels of}} wheat (all types) {{with an average}} harvest value of over 220, 000, 000. White wheat comprised about 126, 234, 000 bushels of that total, about 87 percent. In recent years the financial circumstances, for several reasons, have deteriorated for many farmers and grain handlers in the PNW. The reduced incomes have stimulated renewed exploration for some means of increasing revenues and/or stabilizing net prices received. The effective marketing of wheat {{in other areas of}} the U. S. involves the use of wheat futures markets. PNW producers and handlers of White wheat have not generally had this opportunity because the White wheat is not deliverable on existing futures contracts. Consequently, it is desirable to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing existing wheat futures contracts in spite of nondelivery. If the White wheat price patterns move in favorable relation to the price of deliverable wheats, then nondelivery may not preclude effective hedging. A one cent per bushel gain by successful hedging would add about 1. 3 million dollars annually to producer income for White wheat in the PNW. Results for a ten year period indicate there are certain hedging strategies which appear to be profitable to PNW White wheat traders. The December wheat futures cortract prcvids long term gross benefits (not considering transaction costs or holding costs) of 5 to 7 cents per bushel on short hedges opened between the first week in March and the third week in March, and closed in the second or third week of May. <b>Short</b> <b>hedge</b> benefits for March futures averaged about 7 to 9 cents per bushel with opening dates between the first and third week of September and closing dates between the third week of January and the first week of March. Corresponding results for short hedges with May futures are 12. 5 to 14. 5 cents per bushel with opening dates between the last week of July and the last week of September and closing dates between the last week of April and the second week of May; and for the July and September futures, 8. 5 to 10. 5 cents per bushel with opening dates from the second week of October to the second week of November and closing dates between the second and third weeks of May. The optimum short hedges, all of which fall within the above indicated dates, were profitable nine out of ten years for May futures; eight out of ten years for December, July and September contracts, and seven out of ten years for March contracts. Long hedging strategies were not found to be as frequently profitable [...] eight out of ten years for July contracts; seven out of ten years for May contracts; six out of ten years for December and March contracts and five out of ten years for September contracts. Optimum long hedges using December futures provided 8. 7 to 10. 7 cents per bushel with opening dates between the second and third weeks of May and closing dates between the first week of July and the third week of September; for March futures, 10 to 12 cents per bushel with opening dates between the second and third weeks of May and closing dates between the first and third weeks of September; for May futures, 2. 5 to 3. 5 cents per bushel with opening dates between the second and fourth weeks of June and closing dates between the second week of August and the third week of September; for July futures, 7. 5 to 9. 5 cents per bushel with opening dates between the second and third weeks of May and closing dates between the first and second weeks of July; and for September contracts, 9. 3 to 11. 3 cents per bushel with opening dates in the second and third weeks of May and closing dates in the second week of September. In several instances, profits or losses were generated in both the cash and futures transactions, indicating that while several of the optimum strategies did generate overall profitable results, the hedge would really need to be considered a "speculative hedge" rather than a "traditional hedge" wherein cash and futures losses and gains are generally offsetting to at least some extent...|$|E

We analyze this issue by using a unique and comprehensive dataset which allows us to analyze the trading pattern of hedge funds around corporate mergers and acquisitions in both the equity and derivatives markets. In general, our {{results are consistent with}} hedge funds, with short-term investment horizons (henceforth, short-term hedge funds) taking advantage of private information and engaging in trading based on such information. We show that short-term hedge funds holdings of a target’s shares in the quarter prior to the M&A announcement date are positively related to the profitability of the deal as measured by the target premium. In addition, we also find that the target price run-up before the deal announcement date is significantly greater for deals with greater <b>short</b> term <b>hedge</b> fund holdings. We also find evidence consistent with informed abnormal short selling and put buying in the corresponding acquirer’s stock prior to M&A announcements.

We consider alternative explanations for such <b>short</b> term <b>hedge</b> fund holdings in target firms; however our results seem inconsistent with these alternative explanations but rather, seem to be consistent with trading based on insider information.
