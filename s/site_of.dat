40|$|We have visualized the intranuclear {{topography}} of adenovirus replication and transcription in infected HeLa cells. The {{results show that}} viral DNA replication occurs in multiple foci that are highly organized in the nucleoplasm. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that newly synthesized viral double-stranded DNA molecules are displaced from the replication foci and spread throughout the nucleoplasm, while the single-stranded DNA replication intermediates accumulate in adjacent sites. Double-labelling experiments and confocal microscopy show that replication occurs in foci localized at the periphery <b>of</b> the <b>sites</b> where single-stranded DNA accumulates. The simultaneous visualization of viral replication and transcription reveals that the <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> transcription are predominantly separated from the <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> replication. Transcription is detected adjacent to the replication foci and extends around the <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> single-stranded DNA accumulation. These data indicate that newly synthesized double-stranded DNA molecules are displaced from the replication foci and spread in the surrounding nucleoplasm, where they are used as templates for transcription. Splicing snRNPs are shown to co-localize with the <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> transcription and to be excluded from the <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> replication. This provides evidence that splicing of viral RNAs occurs co-transcriptionally and that the <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> viral DNA replication are spatially distinct from the <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> RNA transcription and processing...|$|R
