5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E

Greg Knot from Chicago Tribune said that [...] "Peacock" [...] adapting the beat from Basil's [...] "Mickey" [...] into a suggestive metaphor [...] "barely qualifies as an off-color joke {{let alone a}} song." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic found the singer to have distinguished herself through [...] "desperate vulgarity". Erlewine concluded: [...] "All this stylized provocation is exhausting, {{and not just because}} there's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> (none of it actually arousing).

[...] Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX magazine about the 3-D conversion, saying that [...] "The way David Yates is approaching 3-D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. Trying to use the sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3-D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments. So we're approaching it in a storytelling way." ...|$|E

Or did he not give the work a number at all, because he was not satisfied with it?" [...] The composer's daughter Katarina spoke of the self-doubt that afflicted her father at this time, aggravated by the continuing expectations and fuss that surrounded the Eighth Symphony.

Gossard commented that there was more [...] "contouring" [...] and [...] "honing" [...] of demo {{material}} than on previous records. Regarding the recording sessions, drummer Jack Irons said, [...] "We didn't put any time limit on it. It was like, 'When this record's done, we call it a record.' We took out time to come up with ideal sounds and feel for every song, so that each had its own identity. We would cut a track and go back and listen to it and openly discuss it."

This is a staple of human history, and we started to look through film samples of it. There really wasn't one that both made you feel {{what it was like to}} be there on the ground and gave you a sense of the geography of the battle." [...] According to Benioff, they also wanted to demonstrate the role luck plays in battle, [...] "Just to feel the kind of randomness of it where there's arrows falling from everywhere, people are getting killed, people are getting trampled by horses, and <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is just luck. Jon Snow is a very skilled combatant, but part of the reason he survives this battle is just he gets lucky".|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} late March 2009, and {{finished}} {{on the end}} of July the same year. Director Martin Wood wanted to film the season in a more graphic novel style. Wood directed both parts of [...] "End of Nights", [...] "Hero", [...] "Next Tuesday" [...] and both parts of [...] "Kali". Brenton Spencer directed [...] "Eulogy", [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] and [...] "Penance". The producers felt that Spencer did [...] "a great job" [...] in making sense on a lot of moves he had to make, as well as understanding that the stories are important in getting things back on track in [...] "Eulogy". The episode ended up being 17 minutes longer than usual, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> had to be cut. Steven A. Adelson directed [...] "Fragments" [...] and [...] "Sleepers". Amanda Tapping directed [...] "Veritas", her first directorial credit since the Stargate SG-1 episode [...] "Resurrection" [...] in 2004. To direct the scenes featuring Magnus, Tapping rehearsed them to decide how it would be shot, then appointed somebody to handle the cameras. Peter DeLuise directed [...] "Haunted".

[...] Melton later confirmed that was the [...] "Garage Trap", which involved a car and sets off a [...] "chain reaction" [...] with other characters. Gabby West {{was part of the}} trap. She told VH1, [...] "They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button. They put layers and layers of different materials on you and you have two straws in your nose so you can breathe. It was so scary!

500|$|Roger Ebert, {{writing in}} the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film {{three out of four}} stars. He praised the [...] "convincing" [...] acting and [...] "realistic {{locations}} and terse dialogue" [...] but questioned the verisimilitude of the story and concluded, [...] "Body of Lies contains enough you can believe, or almost believe, that you wish <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> weren't sensationally implausible." [...] Kenneth Turan reached the same conclusion in the Los Angeles Times, [...] "The skill of top-flight director Ridley Scott and his veteran production team, not to mention the ability of stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, ensure that this story of spies and terrorism in the Middle East is always crisp and watchable," [...] he writes, [...] "but as the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention." [...] Lou Lumenick in the New York Post writes that, [...] "There's nothing here we haven't seen in many other movies" [...] and Lisa Kennedy in the Denver Post summarised: [...] "Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results. The movie might be set in the Age of Jihad. But the rules of trust and mistrust are wholly familiar." ...|$|E

Cowley emphasised the mystical {{nature of the}} poem and how its themes were closer to Buddhism than Anglicanism while mentioning his appreciation {{of many of the}} passages. Schwartz also mentioned the Buddhist images and his admiration for many of the lines in Little Gidding. F. B. Pinion believed that the fourth section of the poem caused [...] "Eliot more trouble and vexation than any passage of the same length he ever wrote, and is his greatest achievement in the Four Quartets." [...] E. M. Forster did not like Eliot's emphasis on pain and responded to the poem: [...] "Of course there's pain on and off through each individual's life... You can't shirk it and so on. But why should it be endorsed by the schoolmaster and sanctified by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is caused by disease and bullies? It is here that Eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer." [...] Writing in 2003, Roger Scruton wrote that in [...] "Little Gidding" [...] Eliot achieved [...] "that for which he envies Dante—namely, a poetry of belief, in which belief and words are one, and in which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautiful language".|$|E

[...] On the {{syndicated}} television program Siskel & Ebert At the Movies, Ebert gave the film a [...] "Thumbs Up" [...] rating, while his colleague, Gene Siskel, gave the film a [...] "Thumbs Down". Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune, stated that the film was [...] "a joyful but empty mixture of Irish kids and black American soul music". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly criticized the overall premise as being [...] "downright insulting", explaining, [...] "In Parker's hands, soul music becomes {{little more than a}} self-serving metaphor – an easy symbol for 'commitment' and integrity." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "... the predictable way in which the band's nine men and three women argue about music, sex and fame robs the story of urgency." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times stated, [...] "The Commitments becomes repetitive after a while, since <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is about the group's stage show, and since the effort to create an off-stage story never really works."

From the Resi 4 mood of the scarecrow puzzle to the unexpected oddity of the music box level, this is a game that seemingly hasn't heard of DLC – and decides to offer you immense value for money instead." [...] The publication concluded it was otherwise a success. Other reviews noted that it was derivative of other games and that it was unlike the classic Castlevania series. GameSpot's review calls the game [...] "a good start for a series in need of some new blood – so to speak – it's just unfortunate <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> comes from other games and not an original source." [...] IGN found the combat repetitive but felt the puzzles and platforming provided good pacing. Game Informers Tim Turi praised its boss battles, its magic-based combat system, and its story. GameZone ranked it as the sixth best Castlevania title. The staff praised the developers' success at bringing Castlevania to 3D.|$|E
500|$|While On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{was within}} its {{post-production}} stages, Richard Maibaum wrote initial treatments and a script for Diamonds Are Forever as a revenge-themed sequel with Irma Bunt and Marc-Ange Draco returning, and Bond mourning his deceased wife Tracy while Louis Armstrong's [...] "We Have All the Time in the World" [...] {{played in the}} background. When George Lazenby departed from the role prior to the film's release, a complete rewrite was requested, in addition to Maibaum's script failing to impress Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. Following this, an original plot had as a villain Auric Goldfinger's twin, seeking revenge {{for the death of}} his brother. The plot was later changed after Broccoli had a dream, where his close friend Howard Hughes was replaced by an imposter. So the character of Willard Whyte was created, and Tom Mankiewicz was chosen to rework the script. Mankiewicz says he was hired because Broccoli wanted an American writer to work on the script, since <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was set in Las Vegas [...] "and the Brits write really lousy American gangsters"— but it had to be someone who also understood the British idiom, since it had British characters. David Picker from United Artists had seen the stage musical Georgy! written by Mankiewicz, and recommended him; he was hired on a two-week trial and kept on {{for the rest of the}} movie. Mankiewicz later estimated the novel provided around 45 minutes of the film's final running time.|$|E
