40|$|Cache <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attacks</b> {{are serious}} threats to {{multi-tenant}} public cloud platforms. Past work showed how secret information in one virtual machine (VM) can be extracted by another co-resident VM using such attacks. Recent research demonstrated {{the feasibility of}} high-bandwidth, lownoise <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attacks</b> on the last-level cache (LLC), which is shared by all the cores in the processor package, enabling attacks even when VMs are scheduled on different cores. This paper shows how such LLC <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attacks</b> can be defeated using a performance optimization feature recently introduced in commodity processors. Since most cloud servers use Intel processors, we show how the Intel Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) {{can be used to}} provide a system-level protection mechanism to defend from <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attacks</b> on the shared LLC. CAT is a waybased hardware cache-partitioning mechanism for enforcing quality-of-service with respect to LLC occupancy. However, it cannot be directly used to defeat cache <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attacks</b> due to the very limited number of partitions it provides. We present CATalyst, a pseudo-locking mechanism which uses CAT to partition the LLC into a hybrid hardwaresoftware managed cache. We implement a proof-of-concept system using Xen and Linux running on a server with Intel processors, and show that LLC <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attacks</b> can be defeated. Furthermore, CATalyst only causes very small performance overhead when used for security, and has negligible impact on legacy applications.

We {{introduce}} new methods for detecting control-flow <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attacks,</b> transforming C source code to eliminate such attacks, and checking that the transformed code {{is free of}} control-flow <b>side</b> <b>channels.</b> We model control-flow <b>side</b> <b>channels</b> with a program counter transcript, in which {{the value of the}} program counter at each step is leaked to an adversary. The program counter transcript model captures a class of <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attacks</b> that includes timing attacks and error disclosure attacks. Further, we propose a generic source-to-source transformation that produces programs provably secure against control-flow <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attacks.</b> We implemented this transform for C together with a static checker that conservatively checks x 86 assembly for violations of program counter security; our checker allows us to compile with optimizations while retaining assurance the resulting code is secure. We then measured our technique’s effect on the performance of binary modular exponentiation and real-world implementations in C of RC 5 and IDEA: we found it has a performance overhead of at most 5 × and a stack space overhead of at most 2 ×. Our approach to <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> security is practical, generally applicable, and provably secure against an interesting class of <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attacks.</b> ...|$|R

We {{show that}} a {{randomized}} addition-subtraction chains countermeasure against side channel attacks is vulnerable to SPA attack, a kind of <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attack,</b> under distinguishability between addition and doubling. A <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attack</b> is an attack that takes advantage of information leaked during execution of a cryptographic procedure. The randomized addition-subtraction chains countermeasure has been proposed by Oswald-Aigner, and is a random decision inserted into computations. However, its immunity to side channel attacks is still controversial. As for timing attack, a kind of <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attack,</b> the randomized addition-subtraction chains countermeasure is also vulnerable. Moreover, compared with other countermeasures against side channel attacks, the randomized addition-subtraction chains countermeasure, after being improved to prevent side channel attacks, is much slower...|$|E

Unlike {{physical}} <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attacks</b> that mostly target embedded cryptographic devices, cache-based <b>side</b> <b>channel</b> <b>attacks</b> can also under-mine general purpose systems. The attacks are easy to per-form, effective on most platforms, and do not require spe-cial instruments or excessive computation power. In re-cently demonstrated attacks on software implementations of ciphers like AES and RSA, the full key can be recovered by an unprivileged user program performing simple timing measurements based on cache misses.

We identify two basic mitigation approaches: the partition-based approach eliminates cache interference whereas the randomization-based approach randomizes cache interference so that zero information can be inferred. We present new security-aware cache designs, the Partition-Locked cache (PLcache) and Random Permutation cache (RPcache), analyze and prove their security, and evaluate their performance.
