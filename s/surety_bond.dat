5|$|Senator Roberts {{proposed}} legislation {{at the start}} of session regarding the <b>surety</b> <b>bond</b> required for towing carriers in rural areas. SB12-049 would have lowered the <b>surety</b> <b>bond</b> from $50,000 to $10,000 for local entities. The bill was assigned to the Senate Transportation Committee, but was postponed indefinitely after it was introduced. However, after the bill was killed, public upheaval caused Roberts to introduce a new bill, this time in the House, which resolved the same issue. HB12-1347 passed the second time around with a resounding 98-1 vote.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 1909, Democrat Hiram Smedley, county clerk since 1897, {{was indicted}} for embezzlement. Smedley resigned, and Barkley was {{appointed}} to a three-man commission to investigate the losses. The commission found $1,582.50 missing, and the county's Fiscal Court authorized Barkley to settle with the company that held Smedley's <b>surety</b> <b>bond.</b> In May 1909, Smedley {{was arrested and charged}} with 20 counts of forgery, prompting an audit of the county's finances that showed a shortage of $16,000, only $6,000 of which was accountable to Smedley. The scandal gave Republicans an issue for the upcoming campaign. In a series of debates, Barkley's opponent, Thomas N. Hazelip, claimed that the county's entire Democratic organization was corrupt and made charges against past Democratic administrations. Barkley responded that he had no more responsibility for those wrongdoings than Hazelip had for the murder of William Goebel, a Democratic governor who had allegedly been assassinated by Republican conspirators in 1900. He pointed to his improvement of the county's finances through inspection of charges presented to his office and showed evidence that he had fulfilled his obligations as county attorney, a fact Hazelip conceded. In spite of the scandal, Democrats won every county-wide office, although by reduced margins, but Republicans captured a 5-to-3 majority on the Fiscal Court. Barkley's victory margin—3,184 to 2,662—was the smallest of any county officer.|$|E
