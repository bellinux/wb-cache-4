40|$|The primary {{objective}} with radiation sources and facilities is {{the protection of}} both radiation workers and the general public. The biological shields of the Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratory of the Radiation Protection Institute (RPI) Ghana had been evaluated for a collimated isotropic cesium- 137 source for calibration purpose using MCNP 5 code. The dose rate at <b>supervised</b> <b>areas</b> ranged from 0. 57 to 8. 35 :Sv/h and 0. 26 to 10. 22 :Sv/h at control areas when the source was panoramic. When the source was collimated, the dose rate ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 30 :Sv/h at <b>supervised</b> <b>areas</b> and 0. 23 to 8. 88 :Sv/h at control areas for 22. 2 GBq of the cesium- 137 source. The scatter contribution from the surfaces of the walls and roofs were also accounted for. The scatter radiation in the room decreased to 400 :Sv/h when the source was first collimated and to 3. 5 :Sv/h when the source was further collimated. These results agreed quite well with experimental measurement. To effectively protect the staff, a narrow beam of 1. 2 cm diameter which was defined at 1. 0 m by the total surface of the ISO slab phantom was recommended to reduce the dose rate to less than 1. 5 :Sv/h outside the calibration bunker even when the current activity is doubled.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) {{have been adopted}} {{in a wide range}} of {{industrial}} and consumer applications to perform various monitoring tasks such as search, rescue, disaster relief, target tracking and smart environments control. In many such tasks, node localization is inherently one of the system parameters. Node localization is required to gain spatial awareness of the <b>supervised</b> <b>area.</b> In this work a simultaneous localization and routing algorithm is proposed. The localization is obtained by a ranging technique, exploiting network topology provided by the routing algorithm to reduce the network signaling communication, which is the most power-consuming operation in WSN, as much as possible. To this end, Shadow Edges, a novel class of links, is considered to take into account the lack of communication among nodes...|$|E

30|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) can be {{typically used}} to achieve continuous monitoring (CM) or event detection inside the <b>supervised</b> <b>area.</b> In CM applications, each sensor node transmits periodically its sensed {{data to the}} sink node, while in event-detection driven (EDD) applications, once an event occurs, it is reported to the sink node. Hence, CM applications entail much higher energy consumption since all nodes are actively transmitting information much longer than typical EDD applications. Furthermore, in highly dense WSNs, the energy consumption is even higher. As such, the use of autonomous devices that provide a constant energy supply is becoming relevant for these environments. In this work, we propose {{to take advantage of}} the electromagnetic waves found in the radio-electric spectrum in order to supply the energy to each node in the network. To this end, the antenna and the storage and amplifications system for such device are designed. Additionally, the performance of dense CM WSN is studied using a Markov chain in order to calculate the lifetime of the system.|$|E

40|$|Distribution {{automation}} (DA) {{has historically}} been focused exclusively on improving reliability, but has now emerged {{as a key for}} reducing energy loss and carbon emissions, integrating renewable generation resources, and supporting plug-in EV deployments. Innovation of distribution automation (DA) including the optimal load transfer and fault restoration began around 20 years ago in Japan. Since then, most distribution feeders are automated, and the aged DA facilities must be considered to be replaced. In replacing the system, new concepts must be introduced to the system. Namely, the small DA systems in business offices are unified and integrated into the ones in the branch of the company, and the <b>supervised</b> <b>area</b> or controlled area of one DA system becomes wider than those of the existing system. The DA functions are also innovated. On the other hand, new trend of distribution system is a connection of such distributed generators (DGs) as solar cells and co-generation systems as gas engines or fuel cells. The functions to cope with DGs are also installed to the new system. Caused by a connection of single phase DGs, 3 -phase unbalance must be considered to control distribution systems. A load transfer technology in which 3 -phase power flow is implemented is illustrated as a new trend for a future power distribution system. Considering the intimate connection with smart grid, the paper has pointed out the further development trends of distribution automatio...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} information theoretic {{methods for}} control of one or several active cameras {{in the context of}} visual surveillance. This approach has two advantages. Firstly, any system dealing with real inputs must take into account noise in the measurements and the underlying system model. Secondly, the control of cameras in surveillance often has different, potentially conflicting objectives. Information theoretic metrics not only yield a way to assess the uncertainty in the current state estimate, they also provide means to choose the observation parameters that optimally reduce this uncertainty. The latter property allows comparison of sensing actions with respect to different objectives. This allows specification of a preference for objectives, where the generated control will fulfil these desired objectives accordingly. The thesis provides arguments for the utility of information theoretic approaches to control visual surveillance systems, by addressing the following objectives in particular: Firstly, how to choose a zoom setting of a single camera to optimally track a single target with a Kalman filter. Here emphasis is put on an arbitration between loss of track due to noise in the observation process, and information gain due to higher accuracy after successful observation. The resulting method adds a running average of the Kalman filter’s innovation to the observation noise, which not only ameliorates tracking performance in the case of unexpected target motions, but also provides a higher maximum zoom setting. The second major contribution of this thesis is a term that addresses exploration of the <b>supervised</b> <b>area</b> in an information theoretic manner. The reasoning behind this term is to model the appearance of new targets in the supervised environment, and use this as prior uncertainty about the occupancy of areas currently not under observation. Furthermore, this term uses the performance of an object detection method to gauge the information that observations of a single location can yield. Additionally, this thesis shows experimentally that a preference for control objectives can be set using a single scalar value. This linearly combines the objective functions of the two conflicting objectives of detection and exploration, and results in the desired control behaviour. The third contribution is an objective function that addresses classification methods. The thesis shows in detail how the information can be derived that can be gained from the classification of a single target, under consideration of its gaze direction. Quantitative and qualitative validation show the increase in performance when compared to standard methods. approx. 53, 300 words 57 figures 5 tables 166 reference...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and study}} aims: The pre-school {{years is a}} {{critical}} period for establishing healthy lifestyle behaviours such as physical activity (PA). There are many benefits of taking part in regular PA for pre-school children, e. g. maintaining a healthy weight. Tackling childhood obesity is a national public health priority. Although the rate of rise in childhood obesity is slowing, levels in England remain high in urban areas, in those from deprived backgrounds and in ethnic minority groups such as South Asians. Regular PA also has many other important health and social benefits for pre-school children; it is valuable for developing motor skills, enhancing bone and muscle development and for learning social skills. Despite the well-known health benefits of PA there are high levels of physical inactivity across the UK in all age groups, including the pre-school years. Only a few PA programmes for pre-school children have been tested to see how effective they are {{and the results of}} these studies are mixed. In a report published in July 2011 the UKs Chief Medical Officer highlighted that we need new programmes that promote movement in the early years (0 - 5 years old) in the UK. The ‘pre-schoolers in the playground’ (PiP) programme aims to increase PA levels in children aged 18 months – 4 years old. PiP will open up school playgrounds for pre-school siblings to use with their parent/carer. The “school run” occurs on every week day for 39 weeks a year, regardless of weather. Capitalising on this daily routine to provide a safe, organised, <b>supervised</b> <b>area</b> for pre-school children to enjoy active play outdoors may increase PA and over time, reduce adiposity. Additionally, involving parents in their community settings has the potential to bond them together and improve their well-being. Who can participate? Children aged 18 months to 4 years of age What does the study involve? Eight schools will be selected from locations across deprived areas of Bradford. Four of the schools will have mostly South Asian pupils and the 4 schools will have mostly Caucasian (white) pupils. Families will be invited {{to take part in the}} study, before the schools are randomly allocated to one of the two groups. Four schools will be allocated to the PiP programme and 4 to a group where the usual practice (the control). All participants taking part in the study will have to complete a questionnaire at the start of the study and at 10 weeks, 30 weeks and 52 weeks during the study Where is the study run from? Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust - Born in Bradford Project What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? There may be no benefit to taking part in the trial; however parents will be given a £ 10 voucher towards play equipment following each completed measurement session. The disadvantages to taking part in the trial may include injuries to the child whilst engaging in play and for the adults participating, the time taken to complete the data collection. When is study starting and how long is it expected to run for? The PiP trial is expected to be completed two years from the start of the first wave in September 2012. The second wave of recruitment will take place in January 2013 and the third and final wave in April 2013. Who is funding the study?
