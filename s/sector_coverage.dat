MIR is an essential problem in mono – and multistatic systems. Receivers of sonars or barrier modules, operating in these systems, can receive signals from other acoustic devices by direct track, as echoes from the targets or as reverberations. The mutual sonars interference level depends on many parameters, like: the transmitting signal parameters (modulation, SL, B, T) and bands aliasing, mutual <b>sectors</b> <b>coverage,</b> the distance and mutual localization of trans-mitting transducers and receiving arrays, as well as type of matched filtration.

40|$|Wireless Video Sensor Network (WVSN) {{are gaining}} {{increasing}} popularity due availability of low cost CMOS camera and miniaturization of hardware. For many applications {{it is difficult}} to have pre-engineered deployment of video camera sensors which leads to redundancy. Due to <b>sectored</b> <b>coverage</b> and random deployment, it becomes challenging to model video sensor coverage to identify redundancy and suppress redundant video transmission. Several efforts have been made to model coverage redundancy considering 2 -dimensional coverage. Field of View (FoV) of the camera sensor is in 3 -dimensions, thus {{it is very difficult to}} model the coverage and identify overlap area for realistic camera. 3 -dimensional coverage is largely an unexplored problem. In this paper, a realistic 3 -dimensional pyramid camera coverage is assumed and backup set of nodes are computed. Backup set of a node is a set of video sensor nodes which collectively covers coverage area of the node under consideration. The approach presented in the paper identifies minimal sized set of backup nodes which can be used to adaptively duty cycle the video capture and transmission. The result shows that number of nodes required to remain active to cover the sensor field is reduced and in turn average energy consumption of the network also reduces...|$|R

40|$|Target {{tracking}} and localization are important applications in wireless sensor networks. Although the coverage problem for target detection has been intensively studied, few consider the coverage problem {{from the perspective}} of target localization. In this paper, we propose two methods to estimate the necessary sensor density which can guarantee a localization error bound over the sensing field. In the first method, we convert the coverage problem for localization to a conventional disk coverage problem, where the sensing area is a disk centered around the sensor. Our results show that the disk coverage model requires 4 times more sensors for tracking compared to detection applications. We then introduce the idea of <b>sector</b> <b>coverage,</b> which can satisfy the same coverage conditions with 2 times less sensors over the disk coverage approach. This shows that conventional disk coverage model is insufficient for tracking applications, since it overestimates the sensor density by two times. Simulation results show that the network density requirements derived through <b>sector</b> <b>coverage</b> are close to the actual need for target tracking applications...|$|E

40|$|Headline issue: There are now {{a number}} of {{different}} emissions trading systems in operation around the world and more planned. Linking these systems together would make economic sense, since larger markets mean more buyers with access to more low-cost abatement opportunities in different geographical locations. It would also be good news for companies threatened by the high compliance costs of multiple emissions trading schemes. However, linking systems faces a number of practical challenges, including whether it is possible to successfully link systems with differing levels of ambition or a significantly different permit prices, differences in <b>sector</b> <b>coverage</b> and differences in the eligibility of offsets. Key points: Linking emissions trading systems is a good idea with a number of potential economic and non-economic benefits. However, successful linkage is likely to be difficult to achieve in practice. Linking is only likely to be successful if schemes under undergo a ‘linking partner match selection process’ to assess in detail whether schemes are compatible in a number of key aspects, including their ambition/cap, the price of permits, <b>sector</b> <b>coverage,</b> and the eligibility of offsets. To facilitate future linkages the United Kingdom government should work with partners in Europe to reform the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) as quickly as possible and actively engage with countries and regions that are developing emissions trading systems to ensure that the option to link with the EU ETS is not closed. The design of the future Chinese emissions trading system, though not public, is likely to be well advanced. It is unlikely that it has been designed to harmonise with the EU ETS to any great extent. The long-term challenges of linking Chinese emissions trading system and the EU ETS make an ongoing dialogue between the UK and China particularly important...|$|E

40|$|We {{provide the}} first {{quantitative}} assessment of competitiveness impacts from a unilateral implementation of the European Commission (2001 a) allowance trading directive proposal for the iron and steel industry.

Rather than building another complex model, we provide a simple and transparent partial equilibrium model of the steel market and we vary both economic parameters (abatement, import, export and demand elasticities) and policy variables (<b>sector</b> <b>coverage,</b> allocation method). We are thus able to determine what results are robust or sensitive to the different parameters.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of comprehensive patient management using structured SMBG on metabolic control as well as its cost consequence analysis. Methods Sixty subjects were recruited in an observational study for a period of 6 [*]months. They were provided with the ACCU-CHEK 360 ° View tool to fill in the values of the 7 -point blood glucose profiles in three consecutive days during the study on a monthly basis. Changes in metabolic control were assessed by HbA 1 c and lipid profile measurement at the beginning and at the end of the study. In addition, cost consequence analysis was done considering different level of health care professionals with or without insurance coverage. The Average Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ACER) as well as Cost saving analysis were calculated and compared. Results The analysis showed significant reduction in HbA 1 c during the 6 -month period in all subjects (P[*]=[*] 0. 000). Furthermore, a positive effect was observed on lipid profile. The cost of endocrinologist’s visit in private sector was estimated to be 265. 76 USD while this figure was 149. 15 USD for general practitioner in public <b>sector</b> with insurance <b>coverage.</b> Total complications and mortality cost saving was 154. 8 USD.

40|$|During Portuguese {{colonial rule}} biased service {{provision}} throughout the 20 th century {{resulted in a}} city that today has spatially segregated water services distinguishable along racial lines. In 1975, a newly independent Mozambique lacked the financial and human resources necessary to extend its utility network to peri-urban residents. Water coverage rates and service levels could not keep up with population growth. Donor agencies and policymakers gave {{a great deal of attention}} to large scale-private sector participation but it was unable to overcome Maputo's infrastructure challenges. Today, less than 40 percent of Maputo residents have access to the utility network. Maputo's 'other private sector' - small, informal private-sector providers (SPSP) - serve over 150, 000 residents with reliable standpipes and private connections and have contributed significantly to <b>coverage</b> goals. <b>Sector</b> planners knew less, however, about how they could contribute to future sector goals. This study aims to answer that question through a detailed analysis of their cost and price structures, investment profiles, and operating environment. (cont.) We find that Maputo's SPSPs already contribute significantly to the <b>sector's</b> <b>coverage,</b> service, and financial sustainability goals. They should be viewed as an integral part of Maputo's water delivery system and not 'a problem' like much of the literature brands them. Their operations can be made more efficient, affordable, and environmentally sustainable with the appropriate policy and business interventions. We recommend actively promoting larger SPSPs, universal metering, improved electricity supply, reducing costs associated with water pumps, and taxation and regulatory measures so ISNOs can contribute to all sector goals as planning moves forward. by Jigar D.
