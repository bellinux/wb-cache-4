40|$|We first {{calculate}} the mean photon number and quadrature variance of superposed coherent and squeezed light, following a procedure of analysis based on combining the Hamiltonians {{and using the}} usual definition for the quadrature variance of <b>superposed</b> <b>light</b> beams. This procedure of analysis leads to physically unjustifiable mean photon number of the coherent light and quadrature variance of the <b>superposed</b> <b>light.</b> We then determine both of these properties employing a procedure of analysis based on superposing the Q functions and applying a slightly modified definition for the quadrature variance {{of a pair of}} <b>superposed</b> <b>light</b> beams. We find the expected mean photon number of the coherent light and the quadrature variance of the <b>superposed</b> <b>light.</b> Moreover, the quadrature squeezing of the <b>superposed</b> output <b>light</b> turns out to be equal to that of the <b>superposed</b> cavity <b>light.</b> Comment: 7 page...|$|R
40|$|Polarization {{correlations}} of two distant observers are observed by using coherent light fields based on Stapp's formulation of nonlocality. Using a 50 / 50 beam splitter transformation, a vertically polarized coherent light field {{is found to}} be entangled with a horizontally polarized coherent noise field. The <b>superposed</b> <b>light</b> fields at each output port of the beam splitter are sent to two distant observers, where the fields are interfered and manipulated at each observer by using a quarter wave plate and an analyzer. The interference signal contains information of the projection angle of the analyzer, which is hidden by the phase noises. The nonlocal correlations between the projection angles of two distant observers are established by analyzing their data through analog signal multiplication without any post-selection technique. This scheme can be used to implement Ekert's protocol for quantum key distribution. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The second-order {{temporal}} interference {{of classical}} and nonclassical light at an asymmetrical beam splitter is discussed based on two-photon interference in Feynman's path integral theory. The visibility of the second-order interference pattern {{is determined by}} the properties of the <b>superposed</b> <b>light</b> beams, the ratio between the intensities of these two light beams, and the reflectivity of the asymmetrical beam splitter. Some requirements about the asymmetrical beam splitter have to be satisfied {{in order to ensure that}} the visibility of the second-order interference pattern of nonclassical light beams exceeds classical limit. The visibility of the second-order interference pattern of photons emitted by two independent single-photon sources is independent of the ratio between the intensities. These conclusions are important for the researches and applications in quantum optics and quantum information when asymmetrical beam splitter is employed. Comment: 7 pages, 9 figures.

40|$|Any {{superposition}} {{effect as}} measured (SEM) by {{us is the}} summation of simultaneous stimulations experienced by a detector due {{to the presence of}} multiple copies of a detectee each carrying different values of the same parameter. We discus the cases with light beams carrying same frequency for both diffraction and multiple beam Fabry-Perot interferometer and also a case where the two <b>superposed</b> <b>light</b> beams carry different frequencies. Our key argument is that if light really consists of indivisible elementary particle, photon, then it cannot by itself create superposition effect since the state vector of an elementary particle cannot carry more than one values of any parameter at the same time. Fortunately, semiclassical model explains all light induced interactions using quantized atoms and classical EM wave packet. Classical physics, with its deeper commitment to Reality Ontology, was better prepared to nurture the emergence of Quantum Mechanics and still can provide guidance to explore nature deeper if we pay careful attention to successful classical formulations like Huygens-Fresnel diffraction integral...|$|R
40|$|The {{deflection}} angle {{of a light}} ray can be arbitrarily large near a light sphere. The time-symmetrical shape of light curves {{of a pair of}} light rays reflected by a light sphere of a lens object does not depend on the details of the lens object. We consider retrolensing light curves of sunlight with {{deflection angle}}s π and 3 π by an Ellis wormhole, which is the simplest Morris-Thorne wormhole. If an Ellis wormhole with a throat parameter a= 10 ^ 11 km is 100 pc away from an observer and if the Ellis wormhole, the observer, and the sun are aligned perfectly in this order, the apparent magnitudes of a pair of light rays with deflection angles π and 3 π become 11 and 18, respectively. The two pairs of light rays make a <b>superposed</b> <b>light</b> curve with two separable peaks and they break down time symmetry of a retrolensing light curve. The observation of the two separated peaks of the light curves gives us information on the details of the lens object. If the observer can also separate the pair of the images with the deflection angle π into a double image, he or she can say whether the retrolensing is caused by an Ellis wormhole or a Schwarzschild black hole.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{experimental}} preparation of optical superpositions of high orbital angular momenta(OAM). Our method {{is based on}} the use of spatial light modulator to modify the standard Laguerre-Gaussian beams to bear excessive phase helices. We demonstrate the surprising performance of a traditional Mach-Zehnder interferometer with one inserted Dove prism to identify these <b>superposed</b> twisted <b>lights,</b> where the high OAM numbers as well as their possible superpositions can be inferred directly from the interfered bright multiring lattices. The possibility of present scheme working at photon-count level is also shown using an electron multiplier CCD camera.

40|$|Efficient {{homogeneous}} illumination of rectangular or circular {{areas with}} LEDs is a promising application for double-sided microlens arrays. Such illumination schemes employ a primary optics - {{which can be}} realized with a concentrator or a collimation lens - and a secondary optics {{with one or more}} double-sided microlens arrays and a collection optics for <b>superposing</b> the <b>light</b> from the individual array channels. The main advantage of this design is the achievable short system length compared to integrating lightpipe designs with subsequent relay optics. We describe design rules for the secondary optics derived from simple ABCD-matrix formalism. Based on these rules, sequential raytracing is used for the actual optics system design. Double-sided arrays are manufactured by polymer-on-glass replication of reflow lenses. With cylindrical lens arrays we assembled high-brightness RGB-illumination systems for rectangular areas. Hexagonal packed double-sided arrays of spherical lenslets were applied for a miniaturized circular spotlight. Black matrix polymer apertures attached to the lens array helped to avoid unwanted straylight...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{propose a}} new method of {{controlling}} sig-nal light intensity {{by changing the}} polarization direction of pump light that is incident on a phase-gradient metasur-face. Theoretical analyses and simulations demonstrate that, when the incident angles for signal and pump light sources conform to a certain relationship, the anomalous refraction of the pump <b>light</b> <b>superposes</b> with the signal light. The intensity of the signal light can be fully tuned across a broad-band range by varying the polarization direction of the pump light. Our methods {{will contribute to the}} development of promising techniques to be used in photonics devices such as amplitude modulators and photoswitches...|$|R
40|$|A multi-repeated {{photolithography}} {{method for}} manufacturing an incremental linear scale using projection lithography is presented. The method {{is based on}} the average homogenization effect that periodically <b>superposes</b> the <b>light</b> intensity of different locations of pitches in the mask to make a consistent energy distribution at a specific wavelength, from which the accuracy of a linear scale can be improved precisely using the average pitch with different step distances. The method’s theoretical error is within 0. 01 µm for a periodic mask with a 2 -µm sine-wave error. The intensity error models in the focal plane include the rectangular grating error on the mask, static positioning error, and lithography lens focal plane alignment error, which affect pitch uniformity less than in the common linear scale projection lithography splicing process. It was analyzed and confirmed that increasing the repeat exposure number of a single stripe could improve accuracy, as could adjusting the exposure spacing to achieve a set proportion of black and white stripes. According to the experimental results, the effectiveness of the multi-repeated photolithography method is confirmed to easily realize a pitch accuracy of 43 nm in any 10 locations of 1 m, and the whole length accuracy of the linear scale is less than 1 µm/m...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report the}} results from the CAL/WFC 3 program 11933 to {{constrain}} the effect of count-rate non-linearity on the WFC 3 /IR detector by observing stars in NGC 1850 with and without <b>superposed</b> scattered Earth <b>light.</b> The scattered Earth light raises the apparent count rate of the stars by a measurable amount, allowing us to measure its impact on photometry. After accounting for a time varying sky level we find a small effect at the level expected, about a 1 % decrease in measured count rate per factor of 10 reduction in the true count rate. The precision of the measurement is limited by the maximum Earth light at the minimum bright Earth limb angle allowable under FGS guiding, ~ 2 - 4 electrons/sec/pixel, 2 to 3 orders of magnitude less than the lamp used on NICMOS for the same purpose...|$|R
40|$|In Jewish tradition, {{the book}} as an &ldquo;exemplary&rdquo;, {{the book as}} an &ldquo;object&rdquo; is {{associated}} with an attitude of veneration as expressed by Pierre Chaunu in &ldquo;livre en majeste&rdquo; &ndash; the book in its majesty when referring to the Holy Bible. The content {{of the book is}} revealed by its own referentiality enclosed in its text and by its unfolding through reading. On the other hand, {{the title of the book}} may suggest the plenitude of its text, a semantic sublimation, an essentialization of the content of the book. This is rendered by means of the metaphor, for metaphor implies a &ldquo;translation&rdquo; of significance and senses within syntagmas and word associations that exceed the referential meaning. Therefore, several metaphorical categories may be discerned in the Hebrew book titles. A first category would concentrate symbolic, spectacular, luminiferous values in which light is the main attribute of the book, an attribute made up by <b>superposing</b> the <b>light</b> and the celestial, both defining the Divine: the BOOK as LIGHT. A second category of metaphoric phrasing would incorporate ethical &ndash; theological values. The metaphor BOOK as GATE codifies the idea of accessing, of entering in a livresque, bookish universe open to interpretation. The BOOK as PURITY and GRACE, the BOOK as BRIDE, the BOOK as CITADEL, the BOOK as THERAPY, the healing book would enter the same category. The metaphoric repertoire reaches its climax with the BOOK as HOLINESS, a syntagma that induces the semantics of writing as a sacred task. Other significant metaphors included in the Hebrew book titles are: the BOOK as ADORNEMENT, the BOOK as SPLENDOR, etc...|$|R
40|$|A {{formation}} of internal transport barrier (ITB) {{has been observed}} in many tokamak devices such as TFTR [1, 2], DIII-D [3], and JT- 60 [4]. The characteristic of the profile with the ITB is an existence of a steep gradient. Recently, a similar electron temperature profile to {{it has been observed}} in high temperature electron cyclotron heated (ECH) plasma with YAG Thomson scattering measurement [5] on CHS Heliotron/Torsatron device (R= 1. 0 m, a= 0. 2 m) [6]. In this paper, the characteristics of high temperature ECH plasma with ITB are first described. Secondly, we provide results of the YAG Thomson scattering measurement using six wavelength channel polychromator. Thirdly results of transport analysis are provided. Finally, a density threshold of the transition is described. Profiles of electron temperature and density were measured with a multipoint YAG Thomson scattering system [5] (24 spatial channels, 10 ms time resolution). Scattering light from low density ECH plasmas is too weak to calculate a value of the temperature and the density. Therefore, we <b>superposed</b> the scattering <b>lights</b> of 5 - 20 shots.
