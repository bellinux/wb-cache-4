50|$|The northernmost triple {{junction}}, a ridge-trench-fault junction {{moved up}} the Queensland coast at 28 mm per year. As it moved the magmatism inland stopped and it reached Townsville about 290 Ma. The paired triple junction with this, a fault-trench-fault junction, moved south from Brisbane at about 12 mm per year. The triple junctions in the New England region stopped subduction very quickly because the mid ocean ridge was almost parallel to the trench. The merger converted the trench to a transform fault {{and turned off the}} volcanoes to the west. In between these two ridge trench encounter points, a small triangular <b>shaped</b> <b>plate</b> continued to subduct between Brisbane and Coffs Harbour.

5000|$|The rescue chamber was a {{pear shaped}} steel chamber, the big end uppermost, seven {{feet at the}} {{greatest}} diameter and ten feet high. It is divided into an upper closed compartment and a lower open compartment by a horizontal bulkhead which has a water tight hatch in its middle. Surrounding the lower compartment is a ballast tank of a capacity just {{equal to that of}} the lower compartment. Inside the lower compartment is a reel with 400 ft of [...]5 in steel wire on it. The reel is operated by a shaft leading into the upper compartment. The shaft is rotated by an air motor. On the bottom edge of the lower compartment a rubber gasket is embedded into a circular groove, so that when the chamber is brought into contact with a flat surface (the hatch ring) a water tight joint may be effected with the application of pressure. Attached to the upper compartment is an air supply and an atmospheric exhaust hose, wire wound for strength. Also electric cables for telephone and light are attached. A wire pendant for hoisting and lowering is shackled into a pad-eye on top. This wire is also used for retrieving the chamber in case of emergency. The forward and after hatches of American submarines were fitted for attaching the rescue chamber. They have a flat doughnut <b>shaped</b> <b>plate</b> welded to the hatch coaming upon which the bottom of the chamber rests and a bail over the center of the hatch to which the haul down wire must be attached by the diver.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} carried out to study the local convective heat transfer between smooth wedge <b>shaped</b> <b>plate</b> and a single round underexpanded impinging jet, using thin metal foil technique and IR camera. In the present study experiments are carried out for five different nozzle pressure ratios {{in the range of}} 2. 36 - 5. 08. The jet-to-wedge apex distance (z/d) is varied from 1 to 12 nozzle diameters. The influence of the included angle of wedge is studied by carrying out experiments for three apex angles of 31. 5, 63 and 94. 5. Heat transfer coefficient is calculated based on wall temperature. The local Nusselt numbers, stagnation point Nusselt numbers and recovery factor distribution are reported in present study. Shadowgraphs are used to explain distribution of Nusselt number and recovery factor. It is concluded that local Nusselt number and recovery factor are greatly affected by the nozzle pressure ratios but independent of wedge apex angle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A series {{expansion}} in ascending {{powers of the}} wavenumber k is derived for the acoustic power delivered by baffled or unbaffled planar sources. This series provides a relatively simple means of derving expressions for the power radiated by a baffled source with a known velocity distribution {{and can be used}} for unbaffled plates when the velocity field outside the plate is also known. The terms in the series are calculated from the moments of this velocity distribution in the plane containing the source. If these moments are written as derivaties in wavenumber space, it is shown that a MacLaurin expansion of the Fourier transformed velocity provides an easy technique for computing the first few terms of the acoustic power. Examples are provided for baffled, rectangular plates with various boundary conditions. The arbirarily <b>shaped</b> <b>plate</b> with free boundaries is particularly interesting.

Displacement and traction boundary integral equations and additional contact equations are used simultaneously in one region in the time domain. The proposed method has the capability of automatic modeling of crack propagation and contact of crack faces in mixed mode fractures by adding only new elements in front of crack tips. This automatic capability of simultaneous analysis of dynamic discrete crack propagation and contact problem is not enhanced in any of available commercial softwares. In order to verify the proposed method and so as to show the versatile features and capabilities of the method, dynamic crack growth of edge cracks and contact of crack faces in a T <b>shaped</b> <b>plate</b> is analyzed.
