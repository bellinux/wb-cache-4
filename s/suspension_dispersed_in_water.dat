40|$|Electrophoresis {{studies on}} pure {{hydrocarbon}} oil droplets, <b>dispersed</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> have established {{that a significant}} charge is naturally developed on the droplets surface due to the spontaneous adsorption of hydroxyl ions. It has subsequently been pointed out that this charge should ensure the meta-stability of fine, micron-sized oil droplets <b>dispersed</b> <b>in</b> <b>water.</b> Further {{studies have demonstrated that}} such dispersions can be produced by the vigorous shaking of de-gassed mixtures of oil and water. De-gassing appears to enhance the dispersion process and the natural charging of the oildroplets ensures their meta-stability. Using this enhanced dispersion process, we have found that subsequent heating and cooling cycles, carried out over several minutes, can alter the average droplet size and the droplet size distribution, in some cases producing narrower distributions...|$|R

30|$|Figure  3 c shows {{photographs}} of MNCs <b>dispersed</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> and their T 2 -weighted solution MRIs. MNCs prepared from MMNPs and HMNPs were well <b>dispersed</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> without sedimentation, whereas LMNPs showed aggregation with larger cluster size that gradually settled over time. This indicates that insufficient polysorbate 80 concentrations {{were employed to}} form stable nanoclusters (Additional file 1 : Figure S 5). In addition, T 2 -weighted solution MRIs of MNCs obtained at the same iron concentration (0.74 Fe mM) showed darker images with decreased amount of polysorbate 80. Importantly, MNCs fabricated from LMNPs showed the strongest darkening effect. From these results, in our system, we determined that MNCs fabricated from LMNPs using 50  mg polysorbate 80 exhibited good solubility and provided the greatest enhancement of MRI sensitivity.|$|R
