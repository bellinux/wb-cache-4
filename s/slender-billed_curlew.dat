50|$|The Druridge Bay curlew was a curlew {{that was}} present in Druridge Bay, Northumberland in May 1998, whose species {{identification}} proved to be controversial. The bird was identified by its finder, and most others who saw it, as a first-summer <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew,</b> one of the rarest birds in the world; however, this identification provoked scepticism from some quarters. The bird was accepted as this species (and therefore became the first record of <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew</b> in Britain) by the British Birds Rarities Committee and the British Ornithologists’ Union Records Committee and subsequently rejected in 2013 (Collinson et al 2014), as it identification could not been established as a <b>Slender-billed</b> <b>Curlew.</b>|$|E

50|$|In October 2004, another bird {{showing some}} {{characteristics}} consistent with <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew,</b> was found, {{this time at}} RSPB Minsmere in Suffolk. This bird generated considerable debate, with some observers, including Didier Vangeluwe, who had travelled from Belgium to see the bird, stating that they believed {{it to be a}} <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew.</b> However, by the time this bird was last seen, most observers had formed the opinion that this bird was a first-winter Eurasian curlew.|$|E

50|$|Compared to the Eurasian curlew, the <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew</b> is whiter on the breast, tail, and underwing, and {{the bill}} is shorter, more slender, and {{slightly}} straighter at the base. The arrowhead-shaped flank spots of the Eurasian curlew also {{are different from the}} round or heart-shaped spots of the slender-billed. The head pattern, with a dark cap and whitish supercilium, recalls that of the whimbrel, but that species also has a central crown stripe and a more clearly marked pattern overall; the pattern of the <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew</b> would be hard to make out in the field.|$|E
50|$|The {{bird was}} {{accepted}} as the first record of <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew</b> for Britain by the British Ornithologists Union Records Committee and this was announced in a joint BBRC/BOURC press release on 24 January 2002.|$|E
5000|$|Opinions on {{the exact}} {{identity}} of the bird remain divided [...] - [...] the conclusion arrived at by BBRC and BOURC is shared by a significant majority of the British birding community, {{but a number of}} British and Foreign birders are not convinced that the bird was a <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew,</b> including several high-profile figures. A first-winter curlew at Minsmere, Suffolk in October 2004, and a identification article by Andrea Corso (et al 2014) re-opened the debate on the identity of the Druridge bird. In 2013, <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew</b> was removed from the British List following a review of the Druridge Bay record by the BBRC and BOURC.|$|E

5000|$|These two {{articles}} prompted letters from Chris Heard outlining reasons why {{he believed that}} the case for identification of the bird as a <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew</b> was not proven.

5000|$|After a {{long period}} of steady decline, the <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew</b> is {{extremely}} rare, with only a minute and still declining population. This is thought to be fewer than 50 adult birds, with no {{more than two or three}} verified sightings in any year in the last five (...) [...] As a result it is now listed as critically endangered. It is the first European bird species highly likely to become entirely extinct since the last great auk died in 1852.|$|E
50|$|On 9 August - 10 August 2002, and {{possibly}} {{for a few}} days before that, another bird showing characteristics of <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew</b> was reported from Druridge Bay. This bird was described as being 25% smaller than Eurasian curlew with a slender bill tapering to a narrow point, with black spotting on its flanks, and unmarked white underwings. This bird was not photographed, and only seen by a small number of observers, and no formal submission was made to the Rarities Committee.|$|E
50|$|In mid-June, Birding World {{published}} {{an account of}} the bird, written by Tim Cleeves, his first public statement on the bird. The article dealt in detail with the circumstances of the bird's finding, its appearance, his reasons for making a confident identification of the bird as a <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew,</b> ageing and sexing of slender-billed curlews, their conservation status and likelihood of vagrancy. The article was accompanied by an editorial comment endorsing Cleeves's views. Cleeves also wrote a short account for the July edition of Birdwatch magazine.|$|E

50|$|As of 2002, {{there were}} at least 83 species of mammals, 230 {{breeding}} and wintering bird species, and over 3,000 species of plants. According to a 2006 report issued by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), threatened species included 5 types of mammals, 8 species of birds, 7 species of fish, 22 types of mollusks, 22 other invertebrates, and 3 species of plants. Endangered species include Freya’s damselfly, the dusky large blue butterfly, <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew,</b> bald ibis, Danube salmon, and the European mink. About 33% of the total land area is protected, including 19 Ramsar wetland sites.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew</b> {{is a small}} curlew, 36-41 cm {{in length}} with a 77-88 cm wingspan. It is {{therefore}} {{about the same size}} as a whimbrel, but it is more like the Eurasian curlew in plumage. The breeding adult is mainly greyish brown above, with a whitish rump and lower back. The underparts are whitish, heavily streaked with dark brown. The flanks have round or heart-shaped spots. The non-breeding plumage is similar, but with fewer flank spots. Male and female are alike in plumage, but females are longer-billed than males, an adaptation in curlew species that eliminates direct competition for food between the sexes. The juvenile plumage is very similar to the adult, but the flank are marked with brown streaking, the heart-shaped spots only appearing {{toward the end of the}} first winter.|$|E
50|$|A {{migratory route}} for birds, linking Western Europe with North Africa, passes across the Strait of Gibraltar and through Morocco. 490 species of bird have been {{recorded}} in the country, {{many of them in}} passage or winter visitors. A single endemic bird species, the northern bald ibis (Geronticus eremita) occurs here, and there are about 12 globally endangered species; the white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala), the Balearic shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus), the northern bald ibis, the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), the lappet-faced vulture (Torgos tracheliotos), the hooded vulture (Necrosyrtes monachus), the white-backed vulture (Gyps africanus), the Rüppell's vulture (Gyps rueppelli), the sociable lapwing (Vanellus gregarius), the <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew</b> (Numenius tenuirostris), the great knot (Calidris tenuirostris) and the saker falcon (Falco cherrug). Other birds with restricted ranges in north Africa include the Levaillant's woodpecker (Picus vaillantii), the Moussier's redstart (Phoenicurus moussieri) and the Tristram's warbler (Sylvia deserticola).|$|E
50|$|The {{wetlands}} at {{and near}} the delta of the Ural River are especially important to migrating birds as an important stop-over along the Asian flyway. They host many endemic and endangered species, such as great white pelican, Dalmatian pelican, pygmy cormorant, cattle egret, little egret, greater flamingo, white-headed duck, ferruginous duck, Eurasian spoonbill, glossy ibis, houbara bustard, great black-headed gull, slender-billed gull, squacco heron, common crane, demoiselle crane, <b>slender-billed</b> <b>curlew,</b> black stork, red-breasted goose, lesser white-fronted goose, lesser kestrel, whooper swan, tundra swan, osprey, pallid harrier, short-toed eagle and many others. The pygmy cormorant was observed sporadically before 1999 and more regularly after that. Cattle egret is observed since 1990 between April and September (as most other migratory birds in this area), with {{the total population of}} several dozen couples. It feeds on frogs, mollusks and small fish. Upstream, there are more of the stationary bird species, such as grouse, wild pigeon and partridge.|$|E
40|$|Human history has followed a pattern—which began in Africa but is now global in scope—of exploiting nature and depleting resources. As we have {{expanded}} our influence over the world,  we have also extinguished species and populations at an alarming rate. Despite attempts to reduce biodiversity loss,  the trend is likely to continue:  nearly  20 %  of all humans—more than a billion—now live within biodiversity hotspots,  and their growth rate is faster than the population at large. This article presents nine steps to reduce biodiversity loss,  with a goal of categorizing human-caused extinctions as wrongs,  such as the slave trade and child labor,  that are unacceptable to society. These steps include developing a system of parks that highlight the planet’s biological legacy,  much as historical landmarks celebrate human history. Legal prohibitions that are fairly and capably enforced will also be essential in protecting rare and declining species. Biodiversity endowments—from national governments,  nongovernmental organizations, and private enterprises—can help support parks and native species in perpetuity. Like a good sports team,  conservationists need to defend extant wilderness areas,  but they also need to play offense by restoring ecosystems, reclaiming keystone and umbrella species,  and making human landscapes more hospitable to biodiversity. In the long run,  the most effective forms of conservation will be those that engage local stakeholders;  the cultivation of sustainable ecosystems and their services must be promoted along with conservation of endangered species and populations. The emerging field of ecological economics can unite these goals by revealing the connections between human well-being and conservation.
