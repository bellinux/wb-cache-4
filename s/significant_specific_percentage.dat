30|$|When the {{percentage}} of hazard covered area changes from 0 to 100  %, for each <b>specific</b> <b>percentage</b> of hazard covered area, an average percentage of effectively impacted nodes will result from these simulations.

5000|$|Logistic {{regression}} {{was developed}} by statistician David Cox in 1958.

The increase in the chitosan concentration or the degree of acetylation decreases the specific surface of the synthesized chitosan gel.

50|$|The Machmeter is, on subsonic {{aircraft}}, {{a warning}} indicator. Subsonic aircraft must not fly {{faster than a}} <b>specific</b> <b>percentage</b> {{of the speed of}} sound.

Supersonic aircraft, like the Concorde and military fighters, use the Machmeter as the main speed instrument with the exception of take-offs and landings.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, we need {{to further}} {{introduce}} the concept of average percentage of effectively impacted nodes under a <b>specific</b> <b>percentage</b> of hazard covered area. That is, in a network system of fixed nodes distribution and for a given percentage of hazard covered area, {{we need to}} perform hazard impact simulations for many times by changing hazard locations, then calculate the average percentage of effectively impacted nodes, to derive the hazard impact value under this specific hazard covered area.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{fractional}} {{split in}} profit was agreed on beforehand, the investor could not stipulate a specific {{sum of the}} money from the profit, or that a certain profit be made. In this way, the qirad remained a complete risk on the investor and did not infringe on the free market economy., It was however possible to make a deal on the split of the profit beforehand by stipulating a <b>specific</b> <b>percentage.</b> This could be either a low or a high percentage.|$|R
50|$|Amylose is {{important}} in plant energy storage. It is less readily digested than amylopectin; however, {{because it is more}} linear than amylopectin, it takes up less space. As a result, it is the preferred starch for storage in plants. It makes up about 30% of the stored starch in plants, though the <b>specific</b> <b>percentage</b> varies by species. The digestive enzyme α-amylase is responsible for the breakdown of the starch molecule into maltotriose and maltose, which can be used as sources of energy.|$|R

The percentages for men {{in both of these}} areas of the world are lower, amounting to 63% and 48% respectively. In Asia, 65% of women workers and 65% of men workers are employed in the informal sector. Globally, a large percentage of women that are formally employed also work in the informal sector behind the scenes. These women make up the hidden work force.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{possible}} {{effects of}} political activity on pharmaceutical prices, {{focusing on the}} health care reform period. We characterize firms based on their vulnerability to future price regulation and find that the more vulnerable firms were more likely to take various actions to forestall regulation, most notably coordinating on a <b>specific</b> <b>percentage</b> price increase during 1993. Since moderating price increases could have been an effective tool to avert regulation, the coordination we observe is the obvious response of the industry to a classic collective action problem. ...|$|R

5000|$|Central {{government}} funding {{is the main}} source of revenue for the communities of [...] "common regime". Redistribution, or transfer payments, are given to the communities of common regime to manage the responsibilities they have assumed. The amount they receive is based upon several calculations which include a consideration for population, land area, administrative units, dispersal of population, relative poverty, fiscal pressure and insularity. The central government is committed to returning a <b>specific</b> <b>percentage</b> of taxes to all communities with common regime, within the differences allowed for fiscal equalization.
