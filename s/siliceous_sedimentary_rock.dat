The formation represents deep water deposition below carbonate compensation depths, in contrast to contemporaneous chert-bearing intervals, such as the Early Mississippian Boone Formation in the southern Ozarks, with chert formed in shallower marine conditions, or as a replacement of associated limestone beds. Source of the prodigious quantities of silica forming the Arkansas Novaculite has been controversial. Geochemical analyses, using both EDX and trace element analysis, were performed using mass spectrometry and have identified a significant contribution by both aluminum and potassium, which would seem to eliminate a biogenic origin and favor a volcanic source, perhaps related to an island arc system that formed during the Ouachita Orogeny as Laurasia collided with Gondwana.

Instantaneous fractionation factors, derived from δ 30 Si-values of the total dissolved (SiTD) silica and mass balance computations with αinst=(δ 30 Sippt+ 1000) /(δ 30 SiTD+ 1000), decrease with progressive precipitation and reduced reaction rates.

The large tsunamigenic slips during the M 9 event {{can be explained by}} a large gradient in fault strength on the up-dip side of the M 9 hypocenter, which was located 17 to 18 km beneath sea level. A large stress drop (approximately 80 MPa) induced by the collapse of a subducted seamount possibly triggered the M 9 earthquake. In the deep (> 35 km) part of the thrust fault, where M 7 -class Miyagi-oki earthquakes have repeatedly occurred, plastic deformation occurs in siliceous rocks but not in gabbroic rocks. Thus, the asperity associated with the M 7 -class earthquakes was most likely a gabbroic body, such as a broken seamount, surrounded by <b>siliceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> The conditionally stable nature of the surrounding region {{can be explained by the}} frictional behavior of wet quartz in the brittle-ductile transition zone. In contrast to the deep M 7 -class asperity, the M 9 asperity (i.e., a region that was strongly coupled before the M 9 Tohoku-oki earthquake) extended to a large area of the plate interface because shear strength is relatively insensitive to lithological variation at intermediate depths.

Thus, establishing the syngeneity of the organic matter embedded in a mineral matrix is a crucial step in the study of very ancient rocks. This is particularly the case for Archean <b>siliceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> (cherts), which record the earliest traces of life. We used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) for assessing the syngeneity of organic matter in cherts that have a metamorphic grade no higher than greenschist. A correlation between the age of Precambrian samples and the shape of their EPR signal was established and statistically tested. As thermal treatments impact organic matter maturity, the effect of temperature on this syngeneity proxy was studied; cyanobacteria were submitted to cumulative short thermal treatment at high temperatures followed by an analysis of their EPR parameters. The resulting carbonaceous matter showed an evolution similar to that of a thermally treated young chert. Furthermore, the possible effect of metamorphism, which is a longer thermal event at lower temperatures, was ruled out for cherts older than 2 Gyr, based on the study of Silurian cherts of the same age and same precursors but various metamorphic grades. We determined that even the most metamorphosed sample did not exhibit the lineshape of an Archean sample. In the hope of detecting organic contamination in Archean cherts, a "contamination-like" mixture was prepared and studied by EPR. It resulted that the lineshape analysis alone does not allow contamination detection and that it must be performed along with cumulative thermal treatments. Such treatments were applied to three Archean chert samples, making dating of their carbonaceous matter possible. We concluded that EPR is a powerful tool to study primitive organic matter and could be used in further exobiology studies on low-metamorphic grade samples (from Mars for example) ...|$|R

Sandy soils occur in arid, semi-arid and humid rainfall zones of the tropics and from coastal lowlands to high altitudes. Sloping sandy soils tend to be used for conservation reserves, forestry (including plantations) and for shifting cultivation, and may also serve as important water catchments. Sandy uplands and lowlands are used for a range of cropping systems including rice-based systems. Plantation crops and forestry are also prevalent. The continuously or seasonally waterlogged lowlands are largely developed for irrigated and rainfed rice cultivation. Tropical sandy soils have a wide range of limiting factors for agricultural use, these include nutrient deficiencies, acidity, water stress and poor physical attributes. The environments in which they occur are prone to degradation risks from nutrient decline, erosion, leaching, salinity, and acidification. Development of sustainable agro-ecosystems in these sandy terrains should be based on optimisation of key ecosystems processes: closing nutrient cycles, restoring hydrological balance; enhancing biodiversity and strengthening resilience of these processes to perturbations. A range of opportunities exist to achieve sustainability of sandy landscapes through plantation forestry, agroforestry, clay and other mineral soil amendments, maintenance of soil organic matter, balanced fertilisation, strategic irrigation, and breeding species for adaption to the constraints present.

Detailed gravity surveys were conducted in order to characterize {{the nature of the}} basin boundaries, delineate additional subsurface features, and evaluate their possible influence on the movement of ground water. Geophysical modeling of gravity and aeromagnetic data indicates that many of the features may be related to processes of caldera formation. Collapse of the various calderas within the volcanic field resulted in dense basement rocks occurring at greater depths within caldera boundaries. Modeling indicates that collapse occurred along faults that are arcuate and steeply dipping. There are indications that the basement in the western Pahute Mesa - Oasis Valley region consists predominantly of granitic and/or fine-grained <b>siliceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> that may be less permeable to ground-water flow than the predominantly fractured carbonate rock basement to the east and southeast of the study area. The northeast-trending Thirsty Canyon lineament, expressed on gravity and basin thickness maps, separates dense volcanic rocks on the northwest from less dense intracaldera accumulations in the Silent Canyon and Timber Mountain caldera complexes. The sources of the lineament is an approximately 2 -km wide ring fracture system with step-like differential displacements, perhaps localized on a pre-existing northeast-trending Basin and Range fault. Due to vertical offsets, the Thirsty Canyon faults zone probably juxtaposes rock types of different permeability and, thus, it may act as a barrier to ground-water flow and deflect flow from Pahute Mesa along its flanks toward Oasis Valley. Within the Thirsty Canyon fault zone, highly fractured rocks may serve also as a conduit, depending upon the degree of alteration and its effect on porosity and permeability. In the Oasis Valley region, other structures that may influence ground-water flow include the western and southern boundaries of the Oasis Valley basin, where the basement abruptly shallows...|$|R
30|$|In {{studies of}} lithospheric strengths, {{rheological}} properties of mantle peridotites are generally {{represented by the}} frictional and flow strengths of olivine (Kohlstedt et al. 1995). However, if the oceanic crust materials {{at the top of}} the subducting slab are weaker than olivine, the movements of the interplate thrust faults are governed by these weak materials. The following sections evaluate the flow strengths of the <b>siliceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> and basic <b>rocks</b> that constitute the oceanic crust. In the interplate seismogenic zone (< 60 km in depth) (Pacheco et al. 1993), both the mantle wedge and the slab mantle can be treated as rigid bodies because the dislocation creep of olivine is not activated at temperatures below 600 °C at the relevant geological strain rates (Shimamoto 1993; Kohlstedt et al. 1995).|$|R
40|$|South China {{is rich in}} vein-type {{hydrothermal}} uranium deposits hosted in granitic, volcanic, and carbonaceous and <b>siliceous</b> pelitic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> The uranium deposits are spatially {{associated with}} extensional structures and/or mantle-derived mafic dikes. Both the uranium deposits and mafic dikes are Cretaceous to Tertiary in age, temporally coincident with the crustal extension. Carbon isotope analyses of calcite deposited in the main-stage mineralization in the veins from 12 representative uranium deposits yield δ 13 C values of ore-forming fluids mainly from - 4 to - 8 per mil, which are permissive of a mantle origin for the CO 2 in the ore-forming fluids. A mantle origin {{is consistent with the}} association of the deposits with mafic dikes and the 3 He/ 4 He ratios of ore-forming fluids (e. g., 0. 10 - 2. 02 Ra for the volcanic-hosted Xiangshan uranium deposit). Isotopic compositions of H and 0 demonstrate that water in the ore-forming fluids is predominantly meteoric in origin. Ore-forming temperatures ranged approximately from 150 ° to 250 °C. Uranium-rich crustal rocks in South China may have been the sources for the uranium. Crustal extension and associated mafic magmatism are considered to have heated the rocks and allowed CO 2 (possibly from mantle sources) to migrate upward and to mix with CO 2 -poor meteoric water. The CO 2 -rich hydrothermal fluids mobilized uranium from the source rocks and then the uranium was deposited in various host rocks to form the uranium deposits. © 2008 Society of Economic Geologists, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
