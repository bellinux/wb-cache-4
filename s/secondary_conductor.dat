There are many ways of obtaining it, or rather of exalting its characters; and all these ways illustrate the principles upon which it is produced. If an insulated conductor, connected with the positive conductor of an electrical machine, have a metal rod 0.3 of an inch in diameter projecting from it outwards from the machine, and terminating by a rounded end or a small ball, it will generally give good brushes; or, if the machine be not in good action, then many ways of assisting {{the formation of the}} brush can be resorted to; thus, the hand or any large conducting surface may be approached towards the termination to increase inductive force (1374.): or the termination may be smaller and of badly conducting matter, as wood: or sparks may be taken between the prime conductor of the machine and the <b>secondary</b> <b>conductor</b> to which the termination giving brushes belongs: or, which gives to the brushes exceedingly fine characters and great magnitude, the air around the termination may be rarefied more or less, either by heat or the air-pump; the former favourable circumstances being also continued.|$|E
5000|$|The {{techniques}} of polystylism and polytempo music have led a few 20th and 21st century composers to write music where multiple orchestras or ensembles perform simultaneously. These trends have {{brought about the}} phenomenon of polyconductor music, wherein separate sub-conductors conduct each group of musicians. Usually, one principal conductor conducts the sub-conductors, thereby shaping the overall performance. In Percy Grainger's [...] "The Warriors" [...] which includes three conductors: the primary conductor of the orchestra, a <b>secondary</b> <b>conductor</b> directing an off-stage brass ensemble, and a tertiary conductor directing percussion and harp. One example in the late century orchestral music is Karlheinz Stockhausen's Gruppen, for three orchestras, which are placed around the audience. This way, the [...] "sound masses" [...] could be spacialized, as in an electroacoustic work. Gruppen was premiered in Cologne, in 1958, conducted by Stockhausen, Bruno Maderna and Pierre Boulez. It has been performed by Simon Rattle, John Carewe and Daniel Harding.|$|E

50|$|Star-Child was {{commissioned}} by the Ford Foundation and written in 1977. It is Crumb’s largest work and requires 47 instrumentalists {{as well as many}} vocalists. It calls for soprano, antiphonal children’s voices, male speaking choir, bell ringers, and large orchestra. Originally, the orchestra members spoke as well as played, and the children’s choir also played the handbells, but this was later revised in 1979 to the current personnel list. The current personnel lists calls for 4 flutes (also playing 4 piccolos), 4 oboes (1 doubling on english horn), 3 clarinets in Bb, 1 clarinet in Eb, 3 bassoons, 1 contrabassoon, 6 french horns, 5 trumpets in C, 2 trumpets in D, 3 trombones, 1 tuba, 8 percussionists, 1 organ, 1 solo soprano, children's voices I and II (SASA), male speaking choir playing handbells, violins I, violins II, violas, cellos, and contrabasses. 2 primary <b>conductors</b> and 2 <b>secondary</b> <b>conductors</b> are also needed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{research}} project entitled Conducting, musical direction and performance in community music ensembles and their influence on pedagogy. The project aims to investigate methods and identify best practices of leadership, conducting and musical direction employed in community music ensembles. It also aims to evaluate the benefits of participation in community music ensembles, particularly how that influence musicians’ performance and their music teaching practices. This research project studies three community orchestras and one big band, of which I am, or have recently been, a member. The research employs multiple qualitative methods: interviews with the conductor/musical director of each ensemble, surveys of musicians in each ensemble through a questionnaire, and focus group discussions with the students of a third year university Ensemble Direction and Arranging subject I teach. Case study observation has also been conducted during my participation as double bassist or pianist in each concert series, and reported through evocative narrative autoethnography. Implications for music education include increased awareness {{and understanding of the}} influence of community music participation on music teaching and the integration of good musical direction and performance practices into pedagogy. The research findings will inform university music and music/education curricula and can be applied to implement effective teaching strategies in the development of vocational skills of musical leadership, conducting, musical direction and ensemble performance. This should facilitate the transition for graduates into professionals like <b>secondary</b> school teachers, <b>conductors</b> of community music ensembles and musical directors of their own bands...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the variation of average axial force density in the annular <b>secondary</b> <b>conductor</b> of a linear electromagnetic stirrer. Different geometries of secondaries are considered for numerical and experimental valida-tion namely, 1. hollow annular ring, 2. annular ring {{with a solid}} cylinder and 3. solid cylinder. Experimental and numerical simulations are performed for a 2 -pole in house built 15 kW linear electromagnetic stirrer (EMS). It is observed for a sup-ply current of 200 A at 30 Hz the force densities in the hollow annular ring is 67 % higher than the equivalent solid cylinder. The same values are 33 % for annular ring with a solid cylinder. Force density variation with supply frequency and current are also reported. Numerical simulations using finite element model are validated with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|A {{powerful}} computational tool, called MagRad, {{has been}} developed which optimizes magnet design for operation in radiation fields. Specifically, MagRad {{has been used for}} the analysis and design modification of the cable-in-conduit conductors of the TF magnet systems in fusion reactor designs. Since the TF magnets must operate in a radiation environment which damages the material components of the conductor and degrades their performance, the optimization of conductor design must account not only for start-up magnet performance, but also shut-down performance. The degradation in performance consists primarily of three effects: reduced stability margin of the conductor; a transition out of the well-cooled operating regime; and an increased maximum quench temperature attained in the conductor. Full analysis of the magnet performance over the lifetime of the reactor includes: radiation damage to the conductor, stability, protection, steady state heat removal, shielding effectiveness, optimal annealing schedules, and finally costing of the magnet and reactor. Free variables include primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>conductor</b> geometric and compositional parameters, as well as fusion reactor parameters. A means of dealing with the radiation damage to the conductor, namely high temperature superconductor anneals, is proposed, examined, and demonstrated to be both technically feasible and cost effective. Additionally, two relevant reactor designs (ITER CDA and ARIES-II/IV) have been analyzed. Upon addition of pure copper strands to the cable, the ITER CDA TF magnet design was found to be marginally acceptable, although much room for both performance improvement and cost reduction exists. A cost reduction of 10 - 15 % of the capital cost of the reactor can be achieved by adopting a suitable superconductor annealing schedule. In both of these reactor analyses, the performance predictive capability of MagRad and its associated costing techniques have been demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, my main {{research}} {{question is whether}} bodily-kinaesthetic skills, expressive movement, and non-verbal communication can enhance methods towards expressive conducting. I investigate the aspects of bodily-kinaesthetic learning that are being used in conducting textbooks, {{the role of the}} mind-body connection, motor skill development, and proprioception in the development of kinaesthetic learning. I also investigate how the movement theories of Laban, Dalcroze, Delsarte, Alexander, and Feldenkrais, and the use of non-verbal communication skills and concepts, can be used to enhance expressive conducting. I discuss how conducting textbooks identified in my two surveys teach expressive gestures {{and the use of the}} left hand, which are two areas that have been identified by experienced <b>secondary</b> school <b>conductors</b> in Melbourne as ongoing weaknesses in their conducting vocabularies, noting how each textbook approaches conducting instruction from a kinaesthetic standpoint. A priority for the training of conductors at all levels of entering behaviour is to facilitate instruction in the bodily-kinaesthetic domain, as too much instruction can often occur in verbal and written form. The significance of proprioception to expressive conducting is the relationship proprioception stimulates between movement and sensory awareness, including its influence on the development of fine motor skills and non-verbal communication. I explore how the use of the expressive movement theories of Laban, Dalcroze, Delsarte, Alexander, and Feldenkrais can enhance expressive conducting at all levels of entering behaviour, and examine commonalities of these five expressive movement theories. Firstly, all five are strongly in favour of the integration between body and mind, which is vitally important for conductors, whose gestures must reflect the music and thought processes happening in their brain. Secondly, all five represent an educational process, and as such, are highly relevant to the teaching of expressive conducting, particularly in the early stages. Thirdly, all five are learnable by anyone, not just those with high entering behaviour. Being learnable, they should be employed in the earliest stages of conductor training. Finally, the importance of proprioception is acknowledged in all five of the expressive movement theories. Conductors can enhance expressive conducting through an examination of the categories of non-verbal communication, such as emblems, illustrators, affect displays, regulators, and adaptors, and the coding of non-verbal communication, particularly kinesics. Although corrective mode gestures and universally understood emblems are important for conductors to be taught, as they emphasise clarity and precision, I believe that more use could be made of illustrators and affect displays by conducting teachers in order to access the declamatory mode. Furthermore, more use could be made of regulators and affect displays by conducting teachers in order to access the narrative mode...|$|R
