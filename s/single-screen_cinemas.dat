5000|$|Sensurround made Earthquake {{a popular}} [...] "event" [...] film in 1974 {{and one of}} the year's highest-grossing films. Sensurround {{presented}} practical challenges, though, in multiplex cinemas where separate theater spaces shared walls. Audiences for The Godfather Part II, which opened the same month (November 1974) as Earthquake, often complained to theater managers about the Sensurround effect when Earthquake was shown in an adjoining theater. The low-frequency vibrations rattled tiles and plaster, too, leading to damage in some venues; a safety net was installed at Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood to catch errant pieces of plaster falling from the ceiling. When Earthquake was screened in Chicago, the head of the Chicago Building and Safety Department demanded that the system be turned down or removed to prevent damage to city theaters. In Germany, Sensurround movies could only be screened in single-screen houses. Subsequent Sensurround films, such as Midway, also tended to play in <b>single-screen</b> <b>cinemas.</b>|$|E

Trade Analyst Komal Nahta said, [...] "On the whole, Brothers, a mixed martial arts film, may carry mixed reports but it will ultimately prove to be a paying proposal for all concerned. It will do good business in multiplexes and <b>single-screen</b> <b>cinemas,</b> and in 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D' class centres." [...] Film critic Subhash K Jha gave 4 stars out of 5 and said [...] "Brothers may not appeal to those who look for laughter in times of despair.There is barely room for a whiff of a smile in this dark sanguinary and seductive tale of destruction and redemption told in a free-wheeling style that accommodates derivations and innovations without apology or awkwardness." [...] The Times of India(TOI) gave 3 stars out of 5. Bollywood Hungama gave 3 stars out of 5. Koimoi(koimoi.com) gave 2.5 stars out of 5. Film critic Raja Sen for Rediff wrote, [...] "Weighing 158 unbearable minutes, Brothers is nearly 600-times as long as the Rousey win - and not one-millionth as thrilling." [...] Sen reviewed the characters of the film and concluded, [...] "But that's all this film has, a ball-busting Kumar and one particular fight that ends with delightful abruptness. Everything else is exhausting." [...] He gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV opines, [...] "For all the hoopla, Brothers, in going for the jugular, punches well below its weight. It makes so much noise that any sensible point about brotherly bonding and filial fidelity that it might be trying to make is completely drowned out by the decibels. Take your earplugs along." [...] He gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5. Anuj Kumar of The Hindu newspaper reviewed, [...] "The problem is, be it emotion or action, Karan is in no hurry to say cut. At times it works for the emotion to seep in but many times over elaboration dilutes the punch. The music is a let down. Kareena Kapoor deserved a better song and choreography for the special appearance." [...] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express summarized, [...] "Akshay Kumar, Sidharth Malhotra's film gets dragged down by its over-wrought mawkishness." [...] At firstpost, critic Deepanjana Pal stated, [...] "Akshay Kumar is hot but with Jackie Shroff and Sidharth Malhotra this film is a hot mess. A few more films like Brothers and Bollywood will have achieved what no amount of litigation can manage — the freedom to copy freely. Because if Gavin O'Connor, who directed and co-wrote Warrior, ever sees how his story has been brutalised, he might just go on a campaign claiming that intellectual property rights be damned, Hollywood is better off not being associated with Bollywood remakes." [...] Martin D'souza from Glamsham stated [...] "The fight director makes BROTHERS look good" [...] and gave 2 stars out of 5. Subhash K. Jha from skjbollywoodnews stated [...] "Definitely one of Akshay Kumar's glorious achievements." [...] and gave 4 stars out of 5.|$|E
