30|$|The updated table {{enables the}} GM {{to select the}} {{appropriate}} game server based on user demands and resources available. While playing, resources allocated for the client remain active. When a customer terminates the game or is disconnected, a message with the request for disconnection {{is sent to the}} GM (the first case, a request to disconnect) or status reports are no longer received (in the second case, inadvertent disconnection).The GM maintains another list of active sessions and updates its state whenever it receives the report from the client. Upon receiving a request to close the session or when stipulated time limit has been exceeded, the GM updates its <b>session</b> <b>table</b> accordingly, so that resources are released and the same can then be used and made available for subsequent requests. In this manner, games are processed on servers controlled by the service provider and client devices need only basic computer capacity and a network access to play. With the introduction of WiFi communication being an integral component of most mobile devices, network performance and, therefore, users’ game play experience also undergo changes. Telecommunication companies are now able to focus their efforts towards pushing more application and game services that would have otherwise been a challenge.|$|E

The aim of this project was {{to carry out a}} systematic investigation and analysis of crimes of violence tried in the courts of the county of Cheshire, in the period 1601 - 1800. The core of the study is formed by details of homicides prosecuted at the Court of Great Sessions at Chester over this period, with supplementary data dealing with non-homicidal violence, notably from the County Quarter Sessions of Cheshire and the Chester City Sessions. As well as the quantitative results drawn from these samples, analysis of depositions and an account of a murder case in Saighton in 1648, published in the Cheshire Sheaf in 1937, allows the reconstruction of insights into the qualitative and attitudinal aspects of the history of violence. The objectives of the study were: firstly, to add new dimensions to the ongoing debate on the history of violence in England; secondly, to gain insights through the history of violence into the changing social psychology of the early modern English; and, thirdly, to provide a body of material on violence from a past culture which will provide useful points of comparison for studies of violence in modern Britain, as well as providing a body of findings against which current theoretical assumptions about violence might be tested. Main Topics : The dataset comprises details of coroners' inquests, where possible accompanied by details of connected criminal indictments, abstracted from the Crown Books and Court Rolls of the Court of Great Sessions of Chester. In addition, details of materials relating to violence have been abstracted from the Cheshire County Quarter Sessions, and from the City of Chester Sessions. <b>Session</b> <b>table</b> contains details of the date and location of each session of the Cheshire Court of Great Sessions, the equivalent of the assizes in other counties, between 1601 and 1800 at which coroners returned inquests. Each session is identified by a unique ID number which provides the link to all the associated records in the database. Justices table contains the names of the justices (assize judges), normally two in number, who presided at each session. Coroner table contains the names of the coroners who returned inquests and their jurisdiction. Note that it was not common for the names of the coroners to be recorded in the Crown Books, the principal source used {{in the construction of the}} database. Inquest table contains details of the coroner's inquests, including the location at which the inquest was taken, the verdict and outcome, doumentary references, alphanumeric codes to identify case characteristics, the number of decedents and any accused, and indications of the type of penalty imposed where applicable. The location of the inquest has been grid-referenced wherever possible. Decedent table contains details of the decedent(s) upon whom the inquests were taken. Accused table contains details of any persons charged as a result of a coroner's inquest. Full transcripts of depositions an account of a murder case in Saighton in 1648, published in the Cheshire Sheaf in 1937 are also provided...|$|E

During their training period, TGDs learn the rules and procedures of each table game, e. g., black jack, craps, roulette—they will deal later. They also have the opportunity to develop their manual skills, computation techniques, and shortcuts and learn the procedures related to table game protection...|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of Internet, online learning management systems (LMSs) have been used widely for providing teaching platforms. The vast quantities of data that LMSs generate daily are difficult to manage manually. Thus, educational data mining (EDM) is applied to solve this problem. In this thesis, EDM is applied on Moodle log data of a medical course. This course was arranged by problem-based learning (PBL) method, which uses virtual patients (VPs) as a problem, to improve students' diagnostic skills. The aim of this thesis is to analyse Moodle learning behaviour related to the usage of VPs and implement a set of Python algorithms to handle such kind of data. There are two ways are utilised to analyse Moodle log data by EDM: applying data mining techniques and implementing Python scripts. The techniques applied on the first way are attribute weighting and generalized sequential patterns (GSP), while the second way provides Python algorithms about extracting frequencies, <b>sessions,</b> and relationship <b>tables.</b> This thesis shows learning behaviour records and patterns about the usage of each VP.
