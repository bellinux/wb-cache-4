5|$|Before Becket {{returned}} to England, on 1 December 1170, he excommunicated Roger, {{as well as}} Gilbert Foliot the Bishop of Lincoln and Josceline de Bohon the Bishop of Salisbury. After Becket landed in England the three excommunicates went to Becket and asked for absolution, but while Becket was willing to absolve Gilbert and Josceline, he insisted that only the pope could absolve an archbishop. Roger persuaded the others that they <b>should</b> <b>stick</b> together, and all three went to King Henry in Normandy, to secure the king's permission for their appeals to Rome.|$|E

Salvador Dalí, who was in New York to attend the MoMA opening, was present at its first screening. During the screening, Dalí became outraged at Cornell's movie, claiming he had just had the same idea of applying collage techniques to film. After the screening, Dalí remarked to Cornell that he <b>should</b> <b>stick</b> to making boxes and stop making films. Traumatized by this event, the shy, retiring Cornell showed his films rarely thereafter.|$|E
50|$|It was Aristotle {{who held}} that relativism implied we <b>should,</b> <b>sticking</b> with {{appearances}} only, end up contradicting ourselves somewhere {{if we could}} apply all attributes to all ousiai (beings). Aristotle, however, made non-contradiction dependent upon his essentialism. If his essentialism is false, then so too is his ground for disallowing relativism. (Subsequent philosophers have found other reasons for supporting the principle of non-contradiction).|$|R

25|$|On April 3, 1945, Gagnon was {{the first}} second flag-raiser ordered to report to Washington, D.C. which he did on April 7, 1945. On April 8, after Gagnon was interviewed by a {{lieutenant}} colonel about who the second flag-raisers were, the Marine Corps incorrectly named Bradley (and incorrectly named Hansen) publicly {{as one of the}} six flag-raisers. While Bradley was recovering from his wounds at the Naval Hospital Oakland after the battle, he was shown the famous flag-raising photograph which appeared in the newspapers and was told he was in it. Bradley was then ordered to Washington, D.C. He arrived in Washington on crutches on April 19 as did Ira Hayes. Both men were interviewed by the same lieutenant colonel about who the flag-raisers were in the photograph. Bradley agreed with Gagnon and his naming Hansen and himself as flag-raisers. Hayes also named Bradley, and claimed he told the interviewer in charge who was the same lieutenant colonel, that Harlon Block was in the picture and Hansen was not. The interviewer told Hayes a list of the names of the six flag-raisers were already released publicly and he <b>should</b> <b>stick</b> only with these six names since Block was killed in action (in 1946, the lieutenant colonel denied Hayes ever mentioned Block to him).|$|E
25|$|NBC's {{requests}} {{became more}} unreasonable and the O'Brien camp refused them, {{such as the}} right to pull any of his final shows if the network objected to the content (i.e., a joke about the conflict/NBC). Jeffrey Immelt, GE chairman, questioned why they were paying so much for a performer destined to run to another network. Negotiations continued on into O'Brien's final week; he could not confirm on-air it was indeed his final week of shows, which produced difficulty in booking the guests he desired for his final show. On January 19, multiple media outlets reported that O'Brien and NBC were close to signing a deal between US$30 and US$40 million for the host {{to walk away from the}} network. Following his Wednesday, January 20 edition, O'Brien remained at the studio until the early hours of the morning, alongside Ross and the legal counsel, trying to finalize the settlement. O'Brien wandered off, playing his guitar alone and stepping out on the deserted Universal lot at midnight, attempting to make sense of the situation. Meanwhile, Ron Meyer passingly suggested to Zucker and Gaspin, based off the public outcry, that they <b>should</b> <b>stick</b> with O'Brien; the two executives agreed to send him on his way. O'Brien signed the agreement that night and the following day the terms were made public.|$|E

The Queen claims not to be Hades' girlfriend, but they just had [...] "an interesting weekend" [...] on Castaway Cay. In the end, the Queen and Maleficent put their differences aside as all villains <b>should</b> <b>stick</b> together and advise Hades to find evil within himself, and not from others.|$|E

500|$|... "Alive" [...] doesn't {{appear on}} the film score of Enough, and instead was {{included}} on Lopez's first remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes (2002). It was serviced to radio in the United States on May 21, 2002, by Epic Records. The song was released commercially on a 12" [...] vinyl as a double a-side along with [...] "I'm Gonna Be Alright" [...] on July 30. Music critics were divided on [...] "Alive"; some deemed Lopez's change in musical style to be refreshing, while others {{felt as if she}} <b>should</b> <b>stick</b> to the dance arrangements of her previous work. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Jim Gable. It features Lopez playing the piano, writing the lyrics to [...] "Alive" [...] and recording the song, intercut between scenes from Enough. While the song failed to appear on any national charts, it did reach number two on the US Billboard Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart. Lopez performed the song live on The Oprah Winfrey Show on May 17, 2002.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Nassiff of AbsolutePunk {{stated that}} [...] "praising this album is {{something}} that can't be done enough" [...] and opined that the album contained [...] "no bad songs", concluding: [...] "Certainly {{one of the most}} memorable records of 2001, Bleed American might actually have the most lasting power of any album from that class." [...] Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic praised Bleed American as [...] "an enjoyable, catchy mainstream rock album" [...] and noted its high replay value, particularly tracks such as [...] "Sweetness" [...] and [...] "Get It Faster". Aubin Paul of Punknews.org stated that unlike the band's prior albums, the second half of Bleed American was [...] "quite strong, and really fleshes out the musical ideas from the record." [...] While noting that those who dislike [...] "emo or 'poppier' music" [...] would dislike the album, Paul ultimately concluded that [...] "the punker-than-thou kids <b>should</b> <b>stick</b> with Static Prevails, but a catalog as impressive a J.E.W.'s can be appreciated by anyone without preconceptions."

500|$|The {{song was}} {{considered}} a [...] "good moment" [...] on the film's soundtrack album by AllMusics writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine. Erlewine called it [...] "excellent" [...] and favored it over the tracks of Survivor (2001), Destiny's Child's previous album. Although considered a great transition for Beyoncé, Vibe disagreed, stating that the song debuted a tepid beginning for Beyoncé, who had high anticipations for a solo-career. Contactmusic.com named the contributions by Beyoncé on the movie's soundtrack as a highlight of the album. Rob Boss of Walmart called Beyoncé [...] "alluring" [...] while reviewing her performance on the soundtrack and comparing it to her performance in the movie itself. Dismissing Beyoncé's acting by stating [...] "she <b>should</b> <b>stick</b> to singing and leave the acting to the actors," [...] Boss called her performance on the song intense and stated that the opening track [...] "Work It Out" [...] was a reason enough to include Beyoncé in the film. Rob Fitzpatrick [...] of New Musical Express gave the song a mixed to positive review, writing that it sounds not only like a perfect imitation or replication of classic funk, but also like a derivation of various other sources and motifs. John Mulvey, writing for the same magazine, considered [...] "Work It Out" [...] {{to be the best}} tune Beyoncé had recorded since [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), and he further commented, [...] "it's Beyoncé yowling, testifying and wigging out in only slightly-studied retro fashion that's most striking." ...|$|E
