5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adopted brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, BMO (voiced by Niki Yang)—concerned that Finn and Jake's hoard of gold is {{threatening}} the structural integrity of their treehouse—talks Finn into <b>spending</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> in Wildberry Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Outside their tree house, Finn and Jake snooze, while BMO (Niki Yang) and N.E.P.T.R. (Andy Milonakis) {{play out}} a spoof of Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham. The two break open Finn and Jake's {{treasure}} room, pouring their massive stash of gold {{out into the}} yard, {{as well as the}} Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant (Steve Agee). BMO talks Finn into <b>spending</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> at an expensive resort at Wildberry Kingdom. When they arrive in the town square, Jake unloads their treasure into the city's fountain. A guard scolds them for this, but they bribe him with a few shillings and a crown, freeing them from the law. Chaos follows shortly after Jake uses wealth to control the residents. When they disrespect her authority, Wildberry Princess (Maria Bamford) orders Finn and Jake to be arrested and for their money to be seized and melted down. Her punishment is for them to be covered in the molten gold, but BMO and N.E.P.T.R. arrive just in time and save the two.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{deferred}} maintenance, {{the condition}} of the subway system reached dangerous conditions in the early 1980s; new construction was, by then, considered ludicrous. Even as the only new construction {{was going on in the}} 63rd Street Line, Manhattan residents at the vicinity of York Avenue and East 63rd Street protested over the MTA's intention to build a ventilation shaft for the line. During the early 1980s, work on the 63rd Street and Archer Avenue lines continued, although the MTA considered stopping work on these projects in October 1980, and <b>spending</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> instead on maintaining the existing system.|$|E

The act also established the Road Fund. The Road Fund Licence (later renamed as Vehicle Excise Duty) was introduced in 1921 and improve roads which had suffered {{as a consequence of}} the Great War. It was intended as charge that could be levied regardless of the fuel used to power a vehicle. The Minister of Transport was responsible for collecting and <b>spending</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> collected although in later years the Treasury assumed responsibility for the allocation of funds.|$|E

He offers {{to take them}} into town to get fitted into rubber boots, but they end up <b>spending</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> he gave them on drinks. Monty is hurt, though he puts {{it out of his}} mind quickly during a boozy round of poker. Marwood is terrified of what else Monty might try on him and wants to leave immediately. After much argument, Withnail insists on staying. Late in the night, Marwood keeps trying to evade Monty but he eventually corners him in the guest bedroom. Monty reveals that Withnail, when arranging to borrow the cottage, had told Monty that Marwood was a closeted homosexual and that he himself had rejected Marwood's advances. Marwood claims that Withnail is the closeted one and {{that the two of them}} have been in a committed relationship for years. He claims that Withnail is only rejecting him because Monty is around, and that this is the first night that they haven't slept together in years. Monty, a romantic, accepts this explanation and apologises for coming between them. In private, Marwood furiously confronts Withnail and insists that he will pay.|$|E

By then, the Archer Avenue project was projected for completion in 1984, and the 63rd Street line in 1985. The Times {{noted that the}} lower level of the 63rd Street tunnel was still under construction, even though [...] "officials knew that the tunnel would never be used." [...] Richard Ravitch, the MTA chairman, said that to stop the work was impossible or so costly as to make it impractical subsequent {{to the construction of}} the subway portion."

No, I can't tell you that I'm going to have that permit until June, but we need to plan like we're going to have that permit in June.

2500|$|In July 1911, Gussie wrote a letter, in secret, to Emma Goldman {{asking for}} any {{possible}} financial assistance from their allies, knowing {{that her husband}} [...] "would rather starve than to beg". Word was sent out around the country and, all told, some $60 was raised, quite a sum for a small family at that time. Rather than <b>spending</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> on himself or his family, however, Winn spent {{the majority of the}} money on a new printing setup and began what was to be his last paper, known as The Advance. On August 8, 1912, the degenerative infection of tuberculosis finally took Winn's life. He was still setting type on the August issue of The Advance the day before he died.|$|E

On the same day it was announced that a new ATP World Tour tournament would be held in South Africa in 2009. In 2010, the company sought to recover $4million from then-CEO Khaya Ngqula, for allegedly <b>spending</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> on his friends and awarding business deals with organisations and individuals in which he had an interest.

2500|$|In 1926, {{the year}} of his entry into Alexandru Averescu's People's Party, Sadoveanu {{motivated}} his choice {{in a letter to}} Octavian Goga, indicating his belief that the intelligentsia needed to partake in politics: [...] "It would seem that what is foremost needed is the contribution of intellectuals, in an epoch when the overall intellectual level is decreasing." [...] His sincerity was doubted by his contemporaries: both his friend Gheorghe Jurgea-Negrilești and the communist Petre Pandrea recount how, in 1926-1927, Sadoveanu and Păstorel Teodoreanu requested public funds from Interior Minister Goga, with Sadoveanu motivating that he wanted to set up a cultural magazine and later <b>spending</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> on his personal wardrobe. In contrast, Adrian Cioroianu notes that the People's Party episode, and especially the [...] "mutual wariness" [...] between Sadoveanu and the National Liberals, underlined the writer's sympathy for the [...] "intellectual Left". Himself a Marxist, Ovid Crohmălniceanu suggested that, as early as the 1930s, Sadoveanu's attitudes were rather similar to the official line of communist groups.|$|E

2500|$|Only in {{the late}} {{afternoon}} on 1 January 1943 did Hitler learn that the Kriegsmarine had in fact been defeated in the Barents Sea, which put Hitler into a huge rage against the Navy in general and Raeder in particular. As a result, Raeder was ordered to leave Berlin for the Wolf's Lair to explain to Hitler personally just why he reported the defeat in the Barents Sea as a victory – a trip that Raeder was not keen to make as he waited until 6 January 1943 before reporting at the Wolf's Lair. At a meeting on 6 January 1943 Hitler savaged Raeder, complaining that he had spent millions of Reichsmarks in the 1930s building a fleet that proved useless when war came, instead of <b>spending</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> on building U-boats, which had proven far more useful in the war. Hitler went on to castigate the Navy, saying that Navy had done nothing in the wars of unification, that the High Seas Fleet [...] "played no important role in the World War" [...] and lacked [...] "...men of action who were determined to fight with or without the Kaiser", that the Navy were a nest of traitors whose only contribution to World War I was the High Seas Fleet mutiny of 1918, and that given this history, it was no surprise that the Navy's record in World War II with the notable exception of the U-boats was one of failure after failure. Raeder, who had always taken great pride {{in the history of the}} Navy, was very hurt by Hitler's account of German naval history, which was almost certainly Hitler's intention. Hitler offered up the recent Battle of the Barents Sea as just one more example of how the Navy except for the U-boats failed him time after time. Hitler went on to accuse naval officers of being cowards not fully committed to victory, and offered a contrast with the Army, which Hitler claimed was run by brave men unafraid of death in their quest for total victory. Finally, Hitler announced that since Germany's capital ships had proven so useless, he was planning to scrap all of the capital ships and use their guns for coastal defence. The gun crews would be assigned to coastal defence, while the rest of their crews would be redeployed to the U-boats and the E-boats or re-trained and sent to the Eastern Front as infantry. Raeder left the meeting of 6 January very depressed, especially over the prospect of seeing his beloved capital ships scrapped and of Hitler's criticism of his leadership. Raeder told Hitler on 14 January 1943 that he could not preside over the scrapping of the capital ships, and informed the Führer of his wish to resign as of 30 January 1943 rather than carry out a policy that he did not believe in.|$|E
