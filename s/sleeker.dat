5|$|No {{rolling stock}} has been {{completely}} scrapped since service began, with the oldest C151 trains operating since the inauguration of the MRT System in 1987. Older trains have been renewed over the years under refurbishment schemes to enhance their lifespan {{as well as to}} adhere to updated safety and usability codes. Refurbished and new trains sport <b>sleeker</b> designs, improved passenger information systems, more grab poles, wider seats, more space near the doors, spaces for wheelchairs and CCTV cameras. As a trial run, luggage racks were installed on the C751B trains to serve travellers on the Changi Airport branch line. The scheme was withdrawn in June 2002 and the luggage racks removed.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the props}} in The Wrath of Khan had been reused from The Motion Picture, or scrounged from other productions, but for The Search for Spock Winter wanted to design uniquely Star Trek items. George and artist Phil Norwood collaborated {{on many of}} the prop designs, {{creating}} updated and <b>sleeker</b> versions of the original television series communicators and phasers. Many props were created out of wood and embellished with small pieces from model kits. While the Federation tricorder was created using a model race car body, the Klingon props were intended to look dirtier, with sharp surfaces that looked uncomfortable to carry. George was insistent on using the shapes and materials, rather than blinking lights, to suggest the props were real and manufactured.|$|E
5|$|Various {{technological}} and aesthetic {{changes have been}} made to the Jeopardy! set over the years. The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them. The All-New Jeopardy!s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount {{on one side and the}} clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and <b>sleeker</b> ones in 1991. In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall, which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, the French stud {{book was}} changed to include draft types from other areas of France that were {{closely related to the}} Percheron– {{including}} the horses of Berrichon, Nivernais, Marne, Augeron, Bourbonnais, Loire and Saône-et-Loire. French Percherons were also hit hard by the advent of mechanization, and between 1970 and 1990 focus was placed on breeding horses of greater mass for the meat market. The largest and heaviest stallions were selected for breeding. Beginning at the 1989 World Percheron Congress, French breeders realized that they needed a lighter breed for tourism, export to Japan for draft work, and other markets. In 1993, a trend of importing American stallions to France was started with the black stallion Silver Shadows Sheik. This stallion and others were used to create a more elegant, smaller and <b>sleeker</b> look in the French Percheron, while still retaining the traditional bone and foot structure. All the imported stallions were black, reviving the popularity of black Percherons in France. French breeders continue to import American-bred Percheron stallions in order to produce lighter foals, moving away from the heavier meat-type horses of the late 20th century. Also in 1993, the Société Hippique Percheronne anticipated the increasing tourist and exportation markets by prohibiting docking, which was not prohibited for other draft breeds until 1996. This was partly {{at the request of the}} Germans, and partly due to the influence of magazines such as Cheval.|$|E

25|$|Visually the car {{was quite}} different. The {{bodywork}} was now rectangular in cross section and spanned the full width over the wheels. Although actually higher, this increased width {{gave the impression of}} a much lower and <b>sleeker</b> car, accentuated by the long stabilising tailfin and the purposeful raised ridges over the engine camboxes. This Blue Bird was clearly a design of the Modernist '30s, not the brute heroism of the '20s.|$|E

25|$|While the 1953 senior Hudsons {{continued}} to be based upon the 1948 step-down design, these cars looked <b>sleeker</b> than the smaller, slab-sided Jet models. Unlike the Nash Rambler, which offered premium body styles such as a station wagon, hardtop, and convertible, the Jet was available only in sedan form. Although the Hudson Jet had an advantage by being well appointed, it was priced higher than base-level full-sized Chevrolet, Ford, and Plymouth sedans.|$|E
25|$|In January–April 2000, Queen of Scandinavia was rebuilt by Remontowa in Gdynia, Poland, with rear {{sponsons}} and, again, a new <b>sleeker</b> bow. The new bow {{is especially}} notable {{due to the}} fact that it has no gate or visor, hence the ship's car decks can now only be loaded/unloaded from the rear. Also, a new marine evacuation system was added on deck 9. All the other life rafts were removed, and the new evacuation system features a chute instead.|$|E
25|$|It {{featured}} {{regularly in}} season 16 during the Key to Time saga. The Doctor's Time Lady companion Romana constructed a sonic screwdriver {{of her own}} similar to the Doctor's. It is depicted as being smaller and <b>sleeker</b> than the Doctor's, and he was sufficiently impressed with her design that he attempted to swap screwdrivers with her in Horns of Nimon. By season 18, both script editor Christopher H Bidmead and producer John Nathan-Turner were eager to downplay the device as much as possible.|$|E

25|$|Finlandia and Silvia Regina were {{originally}} constructed with very 'fat', curving bows to maximise car-carrying capacity, but these made the ship {{extremely difficult to}} handle especially during the winter. As a result, the Finlandia was docked in January 1982 (after just eight months of service) in Wärtsilä's Perno shipyard for reconstruction of her bow to a <b>sleeker</b> form. Following the bow reconstruction additional rebuilding was done at Wärtsilä's Turku shipyard, where additional cabins were built and repairs were carried out on the restaurants.|$|E
25|$|By 2011, the Innovia ART 200 {{design has}} been updated and Bombardier is {{currently}} marketing {{the third generation}} Innovia Metro 300 (retiring the ART branding). While three vehicle orders have been placed, new vehicles {{are still in the}} production stage. Vehicle dimensions are similar to the Innovia ART 200 vehicle, but passenger capacity has been increased through redesigned car layout. The vehicles appear <b>sleeker,</b> with larger windows {{on the sides of the}} train, and redesigned windows and headlights on the ends of the cars.|$|E
25|$|The XU30 was previewed in January 2003 at the North American International Auto Show. Featuring a <b>sleeker</b> {{body style}} than its predecessor, the XU30 {{claimed to have}} a 0.35 C'd figure and new LED tailamps. From the inside, the RX 330 {{interior}} featured genuine Golden Bird's Eye Maple or Walnut wood trim, a sliding multi-level center storage console, dual-zone climate control, and power tilt/telescopic steering column. Available options included a 210-watt, 11-speaker Mark Levinson premium sound system, DVD-based navigation system with backup camera, rear seat DVD player with wireless headphones, panoramic three panel moonroof, and heated seats.|$|E

25|$|When the YOH-4A was {{eliminated}} by the Army, Bell went about {{solving the problem}} of marketing the aircraft. In addition to the image problem, the helicopter lacked cargo space and only provided cramped quarters for the planned three passengers. The solution was a redesigned fuselage, <b>sleeker</b> and aesthetically appealing, adding 16ft3 (0.45m3) of cargo space in the process. A Bell executive contributed to this redesign by drawing on a sketch two lines extending the fuselage to where it meets the tail. The redesign was designated Bell 206A, and Bell President Edwin J. Ducayet named it the JetRanger, denoting an evolution from the popular Model 47J Ranger.|$|E
25|$|At launch, Helio offered two models, the Helio Kickflip and Helio Hero. These {{handsets}} {{were replaced}} by the Samsung Drift slider in November 2006 and the Samsung Heat slider in March 2007. In May 2007, Helio introduced the Ocean, its flagship dual-slider. In August 2007, Helio launched the Fin, an ultra-thin folder with a magnesium body. In December 2007, the Mysto slider saw a limited release to the Korean American market, which was followed up by a general market launch in January 2008. On February 12, 2009, Helio launched sales of the Ocean 2 by Virgin Mobile, a device much like the original Ocean but <b>sleeker</b> and having new features.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2005, a new post-6:00p.m. {{advertising}} style was developed for older audiences, which used a much simpler logo and <b>sleeker</b> packaging with barely any gross-out tactics. In the spring of 2006, the simple logo first appeared on YTV's promos and even appeared on credits of newer original programming. In 2007, this look was adopted for the entire channel. In September 2009, the logo was changed slightly: it featured new colours, and the background was simplified. Variations to the bumpers were reduced. Instead, there are large, opaque digital on-screen graphics telling viewers which programs are coming next, and promotions of the programs. In September 2012, the logo was changed aesthetically.|$|E

25|$|After {{the ship}} had {{become a part of}} the Silja Line fleet, further renovations at Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft Kiel (HDW) in 1987, 1988 and 1989 saw almost all of the ship's public spaces rebuilt. In 1990 Effoa merged with its fellow Silja Line partner Johnson Line to form EffJohn. In 1991 an {{extremely}} large-scale reconstruction was planned, where the ship would have been lengthened by , cabins enlarged, a new outdoor swimming pool added, and much of the superstructure built to a <b>sleeker</b> appearance. Unfortunately the plan proved to be too costly and was abandoned; the funds that had been raised for this reconstruction went to the rebuilding of MS Svea and MS Wellamo into Silja Karneval and Silja Festival.|$|E
25|$|The new {{custom-built}} Imperial sedan {{was based}} on the Chrysler New Yorker. It shared the same trim, but had a canvas-covered roof and leather and broadcloth Imperial upholstery. These features were installed by Derham, on the all new postwar Chrysler sheetmetal. Early 1949 Imperial Crowns were actually leftover 1948s. The really new models didn't arrive until March, 1949. Their styling was <b>sleeker</b> than previous models, yet conservative. Fewer, but heavier bars were used in the cross-hatched grille. The upper and center horizontal pieces wrapped around the front fenders. Rocker panel moldings, rear fender stoneguards, full length lower window trim and horizontal chrome strips on the rear fenders, and from the headlights to about halfway across the front doors, were used to decorate the side body.|$|E
25|$|The 2001–02 {{season was}} a great season for the Mavericks, with a 57–25 record and many sellout crowds in the American Airlines Center. This season also saw a change in logo and colors, {{changing}} from the cowboy hat logo and green to a new horse logo. In addition, the team gained <b>sleeker</b> uniforms. Another blockbuster trade sent Juwan Howard, Tim Hardaway and Donnell Harvey to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Raef LaFrentz, Nick Van Exel, Tariq Abdul-Wahad and Avery Johnson, the Mavericks also made several attempts to sign the Utah Jazz's star Karl Malone. The Mavericks swept the Kevin Garnett-led Minnesota Timberwolves in the playoffs but lost again in the second round, this time to the Chris Webber-led Sacramento Kings.|$|E
