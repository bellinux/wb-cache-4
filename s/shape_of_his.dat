5|$|As the {{gameplay}} {{designs were}} being implemented, Brown switched {{focus to the}} game's aesthetics. Scenes from the game were sketched on storyboards to aid development. Cauldron IIs game world, the witch's castle, was designed to resemble Palace Software's logo as an advertising tactic. Brown photographed separate screens {{of the game and}} assembled them into a complete map, showing the <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> company's logo, for video game magazines. Enemy designs were similar to those in the previous game, based on the Halloween holiday. Brown envisioned a graphical effect for the game's narration, showing a book whose pages turned as the story is read. However, technical limitations at the time prohibited the implementation of such a visual effect. Brown also wanted the game's visuals to scroll seamlessly as the character moved through the game world, but flick-screening (showing one section of the world at a time) was more feasible. As with the previous game, Brown created a Plasticine model of the witch character as a reference for a painting that was used for the game's box art. The group tested the game prior to release and deemed it too challenging. They reduced the difficulty level so that more players could complete the game.|$|E
5|$|Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American {{singer who}} spent over four {{decades in the}} public eye, first as a child star with The Jackson 5, and later as a solo artist, during which time he went through various image changes. Starting in the mid-1980s, {{it became clear that}} Jackson's {{appearance}} was changing dramatically. The <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face, particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery. His skin tone became much lighter. Although Jackson, a black man, was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin, and said that he had not purposely bleached his skin but had used makeup to even out his skin tone, it was also widely suggested that his lighter skin tone was partly due to skin bleaching.|$|E

25|$|The first locks {{built on}} the Toulouse plain by Pierre-Paul Riquet were {{experimental}} and were not satisfactory. They consisted of rectangular lock with wooden stilts as foundations for the side walls. This form did not properly restrain the lateral material when the lock was empty. They then collapsed on themselves. He redefined the <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> locks to rounded side walls, thicker, and more resistant to the lateral pressure of the earth. The dimensions of the locks were then large enough for the time. Because of these rounded forms, {{the architecture of the}} locks in the Canal du Midi is called Baroque style.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, Johnson {{commenced}} {{a program}} of exercise sessions and a run schedule supervised by John Sitaras, in order to balance his strength. Sitaras' initial assessment found that half of his body was much tighter, having acclimated to offsetting the g-force load from turning left while driving. In two years, Johnson's body fat percentage dropped from 20% to 8% (visible also in the change of the <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face), while his strength and stamina greatly improved. Johnson later became the first racing driver to be named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year (in 2009).|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} mark motif was common throughout the 1980s, {{in part as}} a branding attempt. Beginning with season eighteen, the Fourth through Seventh Doctors all sported costumes with a red {{question mark}} motif (usually on the shirt collars, except for the Seventh Doctor – it appeared on his pullover and in the <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> umbrella handle). In the 1978 serial The Invasion of Time, the Fourth Doctor is asked to sign a document; although the signature itself is not directly seen on screen, his hand movements clearly indicate that he signs it with a question mark. A similar scene occurs with the Seventh Doctor in Remembrance of the Daleks.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the persons}} most {{associated}} with Sitaras Method is NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race car driver Jimmie Johnson. The collaboration with John Sitaras began in December 2007, shortly after Johnson was named 2007 Driver of the Year. An initial assessment found that half of his body was much tighter, having acclimated to offsetting the g-force load from turning left his whole life. Sitaras created specific workouts to balance Johnson's strength, a run schedule and {{stressed the importance of}} an adequate diet.

25|$|The {{fight was}} signed for May 22, 1993, and was staged at RFK Stadium in Washington, DC. Ferguson {{came into the}} fight below 230 pounds {{for the first time}} in years and was {{considered}} to be in the best <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career. Because the IBF did not consider Ferguson to be a legitimate contender, they would not sanction the defense for Bowe and only the WBA and lineal championships were on the line. Ferguson thought he had a legitimate chance to knock the champion out, but Bowe disregarded his boasts. Ferguson was knocked down toward the end of the first round and barely made it back to his feet at the bell, then was dropped again as the second round began and knocked out.|$|E

The source most used in the development of those doctrines has been Edwards's own work The Freedom of the Will.

25|$|Specifics {{about the}} third phase, which {{initially}} was to involve renovations to older buildings, long remained undisclosed. In November 2009, plans were made public that LACMA's director Michael Govan was working with Swiss architect and Pritzker Prize laureate Peter Zumthor on plans for rebuilding the eastern section of the campus from the two new Renzo Piano buildings to the tar pits. With an estimated cost of $650 million, his first proposal called for a horizontal building along Wilshire Boulevard. It would be wrapped in glass on all sides and its main galleries would be lifted one floor into the air. The wide roof would be covered with solar panels. In a later concession to concerns raised by its neighbor, the Page Museum, LACMA had Zumthor alter the <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> proposed building to stretch across Wilshire Boulevard {{and away from the}} La Brea Tar Pits.|$|E
25|$|After the movie, {{as seen in}} , Cobra Commander {{is still}} in his snake form and kept as a pet by Serpentor. However, Baroness restores him partly to a semi-human form—through {{exposure}} to an ancient primordial energy called Dragonfire, which {{is the focal point}} of the first five episodes of the new series. The basic <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body is humanoid, his skin and features are reptilian and he retains a taste for flies that he catches with his prehensile tongue. His intellect is fully restored, and upon being outfitted with his battle armor, Cobra Commander once again appears to be a humanoid male. He regains control of Cobra, and even dispatches Serpentor, using the new found Dragonfire energy to turn him into an oversize iguana. Cobra Commander's inhuman origins are never mentioned again, and he is never shown to have reptilian features again. In Season 2, he resumes wearing his original cloth mask, and his eyes appear to be completely human.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 2005, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Dr. Madeeha Khattab, the Dean of the School of Medicine at Cairo University, Tutankhamun was removed from the tomb and a CT scan (computerized tomography) was performed on the mummy. The scan allowed for accurate forensic reconstruction of his body and face, as well as further evidence of his cause of death. Testing showed there was no traumatic injury to the head, he had a small cleft palate that went probably unnoticed, and the elongated <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> skull was within the normal range and appeared to be a family trait after some studies were done on mummies that were believed to have been related to Tutankhamun. Based on bone maturity and his wisdom teeth, Tutankhamun was confirmed to be 19 {{years old at the time}} of his death. The CT scan proved Tutankhamun was in good health and did not show any signs of disease that would have affected his build. Study concluded he was not murdered from traumatic head injury, but a non-violent murder could still not be ruled out. There appeared to be no indication of any long-term disease.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the first directing work of theatrical director Alfons Verli (Koprivnica, November 17, 1892 – Zagreb, November 25, 1940), who put two poetic dramas {{on in the}} Zagreb theatre in 1915. These were Chitra by Tagore and Hugo von Hoffmansthal’s Ludov and Death. Up to that time Verli had studied abroad, mainly in Germany, specialising in direction and theatre studies at many universities and institutes. The paper reveals some hitherto little-known or completely unknown details from Verli’s artistic youth that clearly had {{a crucial role in}} the <b>shaping</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> artistic character...|$|R

25|$|Maerth {{asserted}} that the eating of brain produces an aphrodisiac effect (presumably due to the vast amount of hormones in it), and that this initially caused apes to become addicted to them, organizing brain hunts wherein the males of another tribe were eaten and the females raped {{in a frenzy of}} brain-induced sex and violence. However, this diet also inadvertently increased brain size and intelligence while triggering the loss both of body hair and of our innate psychic abilities. Thus man gradually came into being, remaining cannibalistic until 50,000 years ago. Modern humans, alienated from their surroundings now that they've no telepathic contact with nature and each other as animals do, suffering from a distorted sexuality resulting from hormonal imbalances, and driven insane from the constant pressure of their unnaturally large brains pressing on the inside of their skulls, are inevitably destroying themselves with pollution, overpopulation, racial integration and ultimately, nuclear war. He foresees a return to cannibalism in the near future, and suggests that the reader should drop out of society, embrace a vegetarian diet, steep himself in the wisdom of the East and perhaps employ various wooden frames and wire devices to alter the <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> skull as some ancient cultures did, thus relieving the pressure on the brain and partially restoring psychic powers.|$|E
25|$|With {{his arms}} crossed {{and his head}} {{slightly}} lowered as he skates {{from right to left}}, Grant dominates the canvas. The dramatic impression is enhanced by a low point of view, much in the fashion of Baroque portraiture in the Grand Manner. But for his folded arms, Grant's pose derives from the Apollo Belvedere, a cast of which was present in West's studio. The black tones of a full-skirted coat, elegant smallclothes and shoes are relieved by a white cravat and cuff, a gray fur lapel, a glimpse of tan glove, and silver buckles on the hat, breeches, and shoes; the stylishly tilted hat belonged to the artist. Behind Grant is a winter landscape of restrained tones composed of distant skaters, trees, and a far-off London skyline that includes Westminster Abbey. Grant's figure divides the canvas into contrasting halves: to the right the coat's silhouette undulates gently, and a large bare tree anchors the composition, while the left side, opening onto the gestures of skaters in motion, is activated by the <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> protruding elbow and the jagged contour of coat. Beyond the large tree the recession of the distant treeline creates a movement from right to left which is echoed by the disposition of the secondary figures. The overall handling evidences a lightness of touch and a success in integrating figure and landscape that suggests the open-air portraits of Thomas Gainsborough.|$|E
