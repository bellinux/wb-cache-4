Like the summer {{blockbuster}} movies crowding theater screens, this tour by the pop/R icon resembles {{not so much a}} concert as a series of thrillingly staged set pieces. It's safe to say that her fans will not be disappointed by the two-hour extravaganza. From the diva-style opening, when <b>she</b> <b>rises</b> from beneath the stage amidst a blinding sparkler display, to the final audience sing-along on the female-empowering hit 'Irreplaceable,' the star delivers a crowd-pleasing spectacle that offers as much visual as musical stimulation." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Bollywood Hungama, after {{establishing}} {{a reputation for}} portraying neurotic characters, Ranaut was seeking projects that would be [...] "less emotionally exhausting" [...] for her. Her first release of 2011 was Anand L. Rai's Tanu Weds Manu, a romantic comedy opposite R. Madhavan, which Ranaut considers a [...] "game changer" [...] for her. Rai stated that he cast her for the role to illustrate that the actress was capable of playing other roles and that her character in the film was unlike any of those that she had played previously. Critical reaction to the film was mixed, though Ranaut's performance was praised. Rajeev Masand wrote, [...] "Kangana Ranaut is a pleasant surprise in a cheery, upbeat part that we haven't seen her take on before. <b>She</b> <b>rises</b> to the challenge, only hampered occasionally by her mangled dialogue delivery." [...] Ranaut received Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including Screen and Zee Cine.|$|E

500|$|Bannon set {{her stories}} in and among gay bars in the 1950s and 1960s that were secret. As {{described}} in Beebo Brinker, {{one had to}} knock on the door and be recognized before being let in. In reality, women were not allowed to wear pants in some bars in New York City. Police raided bars and arrested everyone within regularly; a raid on a gay bar prompted the seminal Stonewall riots in 1969 that started the gay rights movement. Because of the atmosphere of secrecy and shame, little was recorded at the time {{about what it was like}} to be gay then, and Bannon unwittingly recorded history from her own visits to Greenwich Village. In 2007, one of the writers who adapted three of the books into a play said of Bannon's work, [...] "I think <b>she</b> <b>rises</b> above the pulp. She wasn't trying to write trash. There wasn't any place for a woman to be writing this kind of material... But I just think the writing's transcended its time and its era and its market." ...|$|E
