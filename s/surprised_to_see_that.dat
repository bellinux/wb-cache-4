Mulder argues against {{other members of the}} lecture over the existence of alien life, claiming that it is a lie created to cover up a program of medical experimentation on civilians run by the military industrial complex. When the lecture ends, Mulder is met by Dr. Heitz Werber, who is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Mulder has lost his belief in alien life since the last time they met. Werber tells Mulder that he is Cassandra's doctor, and asks him to visit her.|$|E
5|$|The fourth episode {{begins with}} Kills {{and a man}} {{involving}} in sexual activity. By the morning, the latter wakes up while Kills is asleep, and steals her passport and revolver. Kills is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he has left and gets angry after realizing that she was robbed. During the 1970s exploitation film-inspired fifth episode, a victim of Kills denounces her to a detective, revealing that she left him in a desert. In the following episode, Kills runs over the man who robbed her two episodes earlier, with her convertible, and retrieves her passport. As the seventh webisode begins, Kills argues with her new boyfriend, who slaps her. Kills meets with him a week later, telling him that she's not angry, however she hits him with a baseball bat.|$|E

That same year, he filed a $3million lawsuit against the producers of the 2010 direct-to-DVD film Camp Hell, claiming exploitation. According to the lawsuit, Eisenberg agreed {{to appear in the}} film as a favor to his friends. He was on set for one day of filming in 2007, earned about $3,000, and logged only a few minutes of total screentime. Because of his minimal involvement in the production, he was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> his face was prominently featured {{on the cover of the}} DVD, implying that he starred in the film.

Malvasia misquotes this letter and copies it as ‘work seems that of a beginner’ the MS actually says the opposite ‘il suo fare non pare da principiante’. It is no <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Antonio speaks of the impegni that he already has, to read that he has learned enough ‘tanto da tirarmi avanti da me stesso’, and <b>that</b> he <b>sees</b> himself as maintaining the Carracci school in Bologna, and turning the studio to service to the Farnese ‘in essa scuola, procurerò che s’avanzino in essa per dovere indirizzare l’opera l’oro al servizio di V.S.

Mr. Gateau was blind, and lost his son in World War I, which crushed him, but he continued to labor over his clock. When it was unveiled at the station, the public was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the clock ran backwards, to which Mr. Gateau says he made it that way so that the boys they lost in the war could come back again and live their lives that were ended too soon.

There is, however, enough room for Zach and Kendall's children to ride in the front seat of the ambulance. Zach and Bianca stay behind and discuss Kendall's fate. They also discuss Bianca's secret that she is pregnant with Zach's child via sperm donation, and Bianca's new lover named Reese. Zach had agreed to father Bianca's child for the couple, but did not know that she had gone through with the procedure of artificial insemination, until now. The two wonder how Kendall, who is unaware of this pregnancy, will react to the news when they tell her. As Zach and Bianca continue to talk, Bianca goes into labor.

500|$|This area of {{long-lived}} {{volcanic activity}} {{has been studied}} and mapped in detail for many years by geoscientists. The first detail studying and mapping of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex was accomplished in the early 1970s by a Geological Survey of Canada society led by Canadian scientist Jack Souther. Edziza was a significant study area by Souther. While mapping, Souther looked at a mineral tenure map of Stikine Country and was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> many of the small cinder cones in the area had been maintained by mineral tenures. Upon investigation, the staking had been completed for the British Columbia Railway, then under construction to Dease Lake. The staking was {{designed to provide a}} ready source of weight for the railway bed. The Geological Survey of Canada agreed to support a series of Canada-wide lectures by Jack Souther to establish the Mount Edziza Provincial Park to protect the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. Coincidentally, Jack Souther had an opportunity to examine the Red Dog (Spectrum) property gold veins and he accomplished several section studies of specimens. It was not Souther's intention to include in the park any of the mineralization within near-surface older rocks. However, the British Columbia Ministry of Parks established the Mount Edziza Recreation Area covering [...] on July 27, 1972 as the park proclamation, providing a [...] wide buffer zone around the park area.

30|$|As {{for those}} {{instructional}} strategies used by students on their own, {{it was not}} a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> most of the students searched and used outside resources. This is to be expected from any students who are proficient computer users. However, as online course instructors, we need to take this aspect into consideration and be aware of possible challenges faced by the students when using outside online resources while designing and organizing our course. It was interesting to find out how often students rely on outside online resources to learn and clarify course materials. It would be helpful to direct the students on how to evaluate online resources, such as checking the credibility and qualifications of the authors and sources of the online resources. After all, not all information on the Internet are correct or valid, which is especially true for technical STEM subjects like statistics. One way to achieve this purpose is to use a social bookmarking website tool such as Diigo for posting relevant websites with quick comments and notes. Online instructors may need to do some searching and place filters or warnings on some search outcomes, if possible.|$|R
40|$|To {{avoid the}} use of toxic {{building}} materials {{is one of the}} principles of sustainable construction. However and contrary to general beliefs, current residential buildings frequently contain many toxic building materials, some of which even comply with legal regulations. Part of the problem is because architects and civil engineers have no form of knowing the toxicity of building materials. The other part is economically related. Some regulations about toxicity limits are influenced by economic reasons. For instance, although scientific evidence about the toxicity of lead plumbing has existed for quite some time, legal regulations avoid imposing very tight thresholds because of the cost of lead pipe substitution (in Europe that could cost almost 200, 000 million euros). It is then no <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the related Directive (98 / 83 /CE) established a 15 -year delay period before the 10 mg/l lead content threshold is enforced. This paper discusses some cases of toxic building materials by reviewing previously published work, it also covers the emission of volatile organic compounds from paints and varnishes, the toxicity of impregnating agents, materials that release toxic fumes during a fire, asbestos-based materials, radioactive materials and lead plumbing...|$|R

The writer predicted the Wall Street sequel's box office performance would be brisk, while the prospects were assured on DVD. Andrew O'Hehir's of Salon.com reviewed the film from Cannes, calling it an [...] "ambitious, uneven, surprisingly talky melodrama, which mixes a quasi-documentary approach to the crash of 2008 with the story." [...] O'Hehir's considered the film to express a more [...] "personal, intimate sense of moral hazard". Marshall Fine, writing in the Huffington Post, viewed the film as an [...] "overstuffed blend of agitprop and melodrama" [...] that contains a cautionary story pertaining to unchecked capitalism. He considered Stone to be proclaiming a message of the [...] "cancerous effects of greed".

Scully said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press that the staff of the show chose Kid Rock and Joe C. for the episode because the two [...] "have a lot of stage presence" [...] and visually are [...] "a funny combination," [...] and because the staff thought [...] "they would be funny playing off Homer."
