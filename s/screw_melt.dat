As a result, extra operating parameters and complexity are introduced, in comparison with conventional injection molding. In this study, a lIM machine was used to obtain micromoldings of polyoxymethylene, high-density polyethylene, and polycarbonate. A data acquisition system was developed to record traces of data regarding the evolution of process variables with time. Cavity filling was followed, at the millisecond time scale, using short-shot experiments and traces of injection pressure, runner pressure, and plunger position. Six characteristic process parameters (CPPs) were defined to characterize both the cavity filling and packing stages. The method of design of experiments was used to investigate the effects of machine settings on the CPPs. Metering size, which was optimized for each set of machine variables, was also used as a CPP. Injection speed was the most significant factor affecting plunger velocity and injection pressure during cavity filling, while the effects of mold and melt temperature varied with the material and machine settings.

30|$|Several {{parameters}} such as nanoclay content, <b>screw</b> speed, <b>melting</b> temperature, {{and feeding}} rate are {{influential in the}} extrusion process and can change the final properties of the prepared samples. Several methods {{can be used for}} modeling and analysis of a system that is affected by different parameters. One is response surface method (RSM) [10] which refers to a set of statistical techniques and algorithms of gathering information, which is employed for improvement, extension, and optimization of processes. On the other hand, genetic algorithm (GA) [11] is a heuristic optimization method that searches for the optimal solution, with high speed, when the analytical model which obtained from response surface method (RSM) is at hand. GA goal is to optimize response variables over a range of independent variables. This method is easy, precise, efficient, and economically attractive. However, in most cases, the relationship between response and independent variables is unknown. In RSM, a proper estimation is considered for the relationship between response and independent variables which is usually a polynomial.|$|R

40|$|A {{continuous}} column crystalliser {{has been}} designed and built using a Schildknecht-type Archimedean transportation screw within a stainless steel jacket. Problems concerned with the surface finish on the inner walls of the jacket which affect crystal transportation have been investigated, leading to effective operation of the apparatus. The process of column crystallisation may {{be considered as a}} multistage separation and purification technique; it is applicable to both aqueous and organic systems. In the present work the examination has been undertaken by firstly continuously crystallising a flow of feed solution in the column. Thesecrystals are transported along the <b>screw,</b> <b>melted</b> and some of the melt liquid allowed to flow countercurrently to the crystals thus washing them by reflux. The remainder of the melt liquid is removed as pure product, the impure product provided by the now impure reflux liquid being removed from the opposite extremity of the column. Separations in aqueous solutions which have been investigated include the desalination of brine, concentration of metal salts, the extraction of deuteriai. moxide from a heavy water/water mixture and the concentration of ethanol in water. The purification of organic solvents included the removal of cyclohexane from benzene and the extraction of para-xylene from 0 -, m-, p-xylene and ethylbenzene. The unit operations involved in column crystallisation fall into the categories of heat transfer, mass transfer and mixing. In order to examine how dependent the efficient operation of the column is on these factors, the system has been optimised for organic, aqueous and mixed organic/aqueous cases.

A novel temperature sensor {{consisting of a}} grid of thermocouple junctions was used to take multiple temperature readings in real time across melt flow in a single <b>screw</b> extruder. <b>Melt</b> pressure in the die and power consumption were also monitored. Three extruder screws at a range of screw speeds were examined for a commercial grade of low density polyethylene. Results showed melt temperature fields at low throughputs to be relatively independent of screw geometry with a flat-shaped temperature profile dominated by conduction. At high throughputs, melting performance and measured temperature fields were highly dependent upon screw geometry. A barrier-flighted screw with Maddock mixer achieved significantly better melting than single flighted screws. Low temperature "shoulder" regions were observed in the temperature profiles of single-flighted screws at high throughput, due to late melting of the solid bed.

40|$|Polymer-clay nanocomposites {{represent}} an interesting topic in materials research {{because of their}} promising properties which can be obtained with very low filler content. As well known, the performances improvement of these composites is realized when clay particles are accurately dispersed in the polymer matrix and intercalation between matrix macromolecules and clay lamellae exist. Many researches have been thus devoted {{to the problem of}} producing intercalated or exfoliated structures, and to verify the internal structure of the nanocomposites. In this regard, melt rheology represents an important experimental tool which allows to prove if exfoliation and intercalation have been realized [1, 2]. Many studies on shear flow rheology of polymer-clay nanocomposites are present in the literature but {{there are only a few}} reports about the extensional flow behaviour of nanocomposite melts [3, 4]. Nevertheless, extensional flows are very common in polymer processing operation, such as in the case of film or fiber extrusion.
