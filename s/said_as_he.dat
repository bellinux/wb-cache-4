25|$|Kuldip Nayar, Shastri's media advisor from 1960 to 1964, recalls that, {{during the}} Quit India Movement, his {{daughter}} was ill and he was released on parole from jail. However, he could not save her life because doctors had prescribed costly drugs. Later on in 1963, on {{the day when he}} was dropped from the cabinet, he was sitting in his home in the dark, without a light. When asked about the reason, he <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> no longer is a minister, all expenses will have to be paid by himself and that as a MP and minister he didn't earn enough to save for time of need.|$|E
500|$|Britain vigorously rallied other NATO {{countries}} {{to take a}} stand against Portugal over Reedman. France warned that NATO pressure was unlikely to yield results in his matter, but Belgium's NATO representative, André de Staercke, agreed to challenge Salazar on 11 September. At his meeting with de Staercke, Salazar denied that Portugal was giving Rhodesia its own diplomatic representation, and said there had been some misunderstanding. Portugal would not obstruct Reedman's entry should he arrive, Salazar <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was travelling on a (Rhodesian-issued) British passport. On 14 September, Nogueira's ministry released a statement saying that if Britain challenged Portugal over Rhodesia at NATO, Lisbon would [...] "use the greatest firmness to repel any attempt to attribute particular responsibilities or to make criticism of Portugal's position".|$|E
500|$|Preparing for {{his debut}} album, [...] Usher lost his voice. Usher {{was going through}} puberty and having a {{difficult}} time adjusting his voice. LA Reid became skeptical of Usher and put his recording on hold thinking about dropping him from the label. Usher pleaded with the label to keep him and L.A. Reid did. From this point Reid didn't {{know what to do}} with Usher so he sent him to New York in the spring of 1994 to live with Puff Daddy to attend what Reid called [...] "Flavor Camp". Usher quickly adapted to the lavish lifestyle of Puff Daddy although in an interview with Rolling Stone, he expressed it as the [...] "Hardest days" [...] of his life. [...] "I had to knuckle up, figure shit out in New York" [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> lived at Puff's house in Scarsdale, he noticed that [...] "There was always girls around".|$|E

500|$|McVeigh's {{original}} plan {{had been to}} detonate the bomb at 11:00a.m., but at dawn on April 19, 1995, he decided instead to destroy the building at 9:00a.m. As he drove toward the Murrah Federal Building in the Ryder truck, McVeigh carried with him an envelope containing pages from The Turner Diaries—a fictional account of white supremacists who ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9:15 one morning using a truck bomb. McVeigh wore a printed T-shirt with the motto of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Sic semper tyrannis ("Thus always to tyrants", according to legend what Brutus <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> assassinated Julius Caesar, also shouted by John Wilkes Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln) and [...] "The tree of liberty must be refreshed {{from time to time}} with the blood of patriots and tyrants" [...] (from Thomas Jefferson). He also carried an envelope full of revolutionary materials that included a bumper sticker with the Thomas Jefferson slogan, [...] "When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny." [...] Underneath, McVeigh had written, [...] "Maybe now, there will be liberty!" [...] with a hand-copied quote by John Locke asserting that a man has a right to kill someone who takes away his liberty.|$|E
500|$|Pembleton and Lange grow closer; Lange {{experiences}} {{more pain}} as time passes, and switches among remorse, anger, and casual small talk during their conversations. Later, Pembleton holds Lange's hand {{to comfort him}} and confides about his recent stroke. Bayliss grows suspicious when Biedron says that he cannot recall his last place of work or {{when he moved to}} Baltimore. Biedron eventually admits that he had been criminally charged and placed into a psychiatric ward for pushing a man in front of a Chicago subway train for no reason. Biedron is arrested, and Bayliss confirms to Pembleton that Lange was pushed; Pembleton decides not to tell Lange because he does not think that it will comfort him, but Lange figures it out for himself by observing their conversation. Lange experiences greater pain and starts to lose consciousness. After saying [...] "I'm OK" [...] to Pembleton, Lange falls unconscious and the EMTs push the train with the airbags. Lange dies immediately after he is removed. A shocked and disoriented Pembleton leaves the subway and, after staring at Biedron {{in the back of a}} police squad car, walks to his vehicle while recalling a line about how sugar maple leaves behave when it rains (a line that Lange <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was dying). He then drives away with Bayliss. The episode ends with Flannigan jogging past the subway station.|$|E

2500|$|At a yell {{practice}} {{before the}} 1930 TCU game, A Board of Regents member Pinky Downs '06 shouted, [...] "What {{are we going}} to do to those Horned Frogs?" [...] His muse did not fail him as he improvised, borrowing a term from frog hunting. [...] "Gig 'em, Aggies!" [...] he <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> made a fist with his thumb extended straight up. And with that the first hand sign in the Southwest Conference came into being. Interestingly, the [...] "Hook 'em Horns" [...] cheer was also invented by a UT cheerleader prior to the November 12, 1955 UT-TCU game. TCU wound up winning both of these historic games.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2002, Pisces V and {{her sister}} vessel Pisces IV {{discovered}} a Japanese midget submarine; sunk on December 7, 1941 by the destroyer [...] in the first American shots fired in World War II, the submarine {{was hit by a}} 4"/50caliber gun shot and depth charged shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor began. The submarine was found in [...] of water about [...] off the mouth of Pearl Harbor. This was the culmination of a 61-year search for the vessel and has been called [...] "the most significant modern marine archeological find ever in the Pacific, second only to the finding of Titanic in the Atlantic". In 2003, Pisces V visited the Japanese midget submarine it had found in Pearl Harbor the year before. The U.S. State Department worked in conjunction with the Japanese Foreign Ministry to determine Japanese wishes regarding the fate of the midget submarine. The submersibles are used by HURL as teaching devices. In 2008, two members of the Tampa Bay Chapter of SCUBAnauts were invited to team with HURL and to visit the historic wreck of the Japanese submarine. One SCUBAnaut <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> stepped on Pisces V that [...] "it looked and felt as if I were in a space shuttle preparing for lift-off".|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{ending to}} the Cain novella {{called for the}} characters to commit double suicide. Suicide, however, was strictly forbidden at the time by the Hays Production Code {{as a way to}} resolve a plot, so Wilder wrote and filmed a different ending in which Neff goes to the gas chamber while Keyes watches. This scene was shot before the scenes that eventually became the film's familiar ending, and once that final intimate exchange between Neff and Keyes revealed its power to Wilder, he began to wonder if the gas chamber ending was needed at all. [...] "You couldn't have a more meaningful scene between two men", Wilder <b>said.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> would later recount, [...] "The story was between the two guys. I knew it, even though I had already filmed the gas chamber scene... So we just took out the scene in the gas chamber," [...] despite its $150,000 cost to the studio. Removal of the scene, over Chandler's objection, also removed the Hays Office's single biggest remaining objection to the picture, since they regarded it as [...] "unduly gruesome" [...] and predicted that it would never be approved by local and regional censor boards. The footage and sound elements are lost, but production stills of the scene still exist.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs Blimber was now {{quite sure}} that Paul was the oddest child in the world; and when she told the Doctor what had passed, the Doctor did not controvert his wife's opinion. But he <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had said before, when Paul first came, that study would do much; and he also <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had said on that occasion, 'Bring him on, Cornelia! Bring him on!' ...|$|E
