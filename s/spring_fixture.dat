50|$|In January 2015 Marušić and Anđelković {{returned}} to Sloga Sloga. Marušić was related with Napredak Kruševac, {{in the winter}} break off-season, {{but he did not}} sign with the club. He started the second half-season {{as one of the most}} experienced players in the club, but he injured in 3rd <b>spring</b> <b>fixture,</b> and he did not play until 22 fixture, against Moravac Mrštane, when he scored a goal from direct free kick. He was in starting 11 in next fixture against Radnik Surdulica, when he renewed an injury and was substituted out during the first-half. Because of many injury problems, Marušić noted just 5 mathes for Sloga in the 2014-15 Serbian First League season and scored 1 goal.|$|E

50|$|In {{the winter}} of 2014, Vulićević moved to Partizan on a free transfer, penning a three-and-a-half-year deal. He joined newly {{appointed}} manager Marko Nikolić; the duo had previously worked together at Vojvodina. Likewise, Vulićević {{was one of three}} players, alongside Petar Škuletić and Branislav Trajković, to make moves from Vojvodina to Partizan during the transfer window. He was given the number 4 shirt, last worn by Mohamed Kamara. After missing the league's first <b>spring</b> <b>fixture</b> due to a yellow-card suspension, Vulićević made his official debut for Partizan on 1 March 2014, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2-1 win over Radnički Niš. He appeared in 11 more league games {{until the end of the}} 2013-14 season, as the club failed to win its seventh consecutive title.|$|E
50|$|Mladenović started 2012-13 {{season in}} the first squad. After first match against Kolubara, played away, he missed home match against Borac Čačak in the 2 fixture, when Veljko Antonijević played on that position. Later, he played all matches {{until the end of}} first half-season, {{including}} cup match against OFK Beograd, when he replaced Dušan Mladenović in second half of that match. He started 2 matches from the bench, against Jedinstvo Putevi, and Radnički Nova Pazova. In the first <b>spring</b> <b>fixture,</b> against Kolubara, Mladenović got the red card after one duel with Saša Jovanović. Previously, he moved on left-back position, because of Miloš Milovanović's injury. Later, coach Neško Milovanović converted Marko Gobeljić to right-back, so Siniša moved on the bench.

50|$|Making solid {{performances}} in previous season, Stefan Drašković continued playing as a centre-back, along with Nemanja Miletić. Coach Veljko Dovedan moved Marušić in midfield, but players with more experience had advantage and Marušić started season as back-up player after he recovered an injury. He was starting matches {{from the bench}} {{at the beginning of}} season, and adopted in starting 11 after Miloš Janićijević's injury, but he injured in shortly time again. Previously, he scored 5 goals on two matches. Marušić and Janićijević had also many injury problems almost the whole season. However, he scored 2 more goals until the end of first half-season, Marušić {{became one of the most}} effective players for that autumn in the Serbian First League. He is one of the most responsible for all 7 home victuries of Sloga Kraljevo in first half-season. Marušić had the dispute with club at the beginning of 2014, when he requested a contract breaking. After his request was denied as groundless, he apologized to teammates and supporters and returned in the first team squad in 4th <b>spring</b> <b>fixture.</b> Later he played the whole matches until the end of season, 8 times as starter and 4 times he entered game from the bench. He noted 22 First League appearances, scoring 7 goals, and also played a cup match against Vojvodina.|$|E

40|$|Machining of {{thin wall}} {{structures}} is a challenging area {{due to the}} problems such as chatter and forced vibrations that arise due to low stiffness of such structures. Up to now, {{most of the research}} was driven by need to improve productivity in manufacturing of aircraft components such as airframe panels; hence, straight thin walls such as cantilever structures were considered for research in machining dynamics. However, thin wall casings and particularly thin wall assemblies that are encountered in jet engine casings are not well studied. Not only their dynamics is quite different from that of straight thin walls, they present a different set of challenges for fixturing to minimise machining vibrations. Hence, there is a two-fold need of research: (i) to understand the effect of dynamics of thin wall casings on interaction of tool and workpiece and (ii) to design and validate damping solutions to minimise machining vibrations in such structures. In this work, both the above objectives are addressed. Initially a coupled dynamic interaction of tool and workpiece is studied through experimental analysis of machining vibration signal. This study was carried out both on a straight thin wall cantilever and on a thin wall casing to present the effect of variation of dynamics on dynamic coupling between tool and workpiece. The machining vibration signal was analysed in frequency and time-frequency domain to see which of the elements (tool or workpiece) are dominant during machining. For providing fixturing solutions to minimise machining vibrations, initially tuned mass dampers were studied. Tuned dampers with increased mass ratio were studied to see their effect in minimising vibrations. Subsequently, two novel surface damping solutions - viscoelastic based surface damper and torsion <b>spring</b> <b>fixture</b> - were proposed and validated experimentally. The design philosophy behind both these solutions is to improve mass and stiffness of the casing in addition to imparting damping. Finite element modelling was carried out to predict the dynamic response without and with proposed solutions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractClick Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) is an {{environmentally}} well-known {{as a failure}} caused by exposure to a corroding while under a sustained tensile stress. SCC is most often rapid, unpredictable. Failure can occur {{in a short time}} as a few hours or take years and decades to happen. Most alloys are liable to SCC in one or more environments requiring careful consideration of alloy type in component design. In aqueous chloride environments austenitic stainless steels and many nickel based alloys are common to perform poorly. Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of austenitic stainless steels of types 316 was investigated as a function of applied stress at room temperature in sodium chloride solutions using a constant load method. The experiment uses a <b>spring</b> loaded <b>fixture</b> type and is based on ASTM G 49 for experiment method, and E 292 for geometry of notched specimen. The stress dependence of fracture appearance and parameters of time to cracking, and cracking growth. The results are explained in terms of comparison between the two concentrations of sodium chloride solutions...|$|R
40|$|Ionic polymer {{transducers}} (IPT), {{sometimes referred}} to as artificial muscles, are known to generate a large bending strain and a moderate stress at low applied voltages (< 5 V). Recently Akle and Leo[1] reported extensional actuation in ionic polymer transducers. In this study, extensional IPTs are characterized under forced and free displacement boundary condition as a function of transducer architecture. The electrode thickness is varied from 10 μm up to 40 μm while three extensional actuators with Lithium, Cesium, and tetraethylammonium (TEA) mobile cations are characterized. Three fixtures are built in order to characterize the extensional actuation response. The first fixture measures the free displacement of an IPT sample sandwiched between two aluminum plates glued using the electrically conductive silver paste. In the second <b>fixture</b> a <b>spring</b> is compressed against the test sample with variable amounts to generate different levels of pre-stress and prevents the bending of the IPT. In the third fixture dead weights are placed on top of the sample in order to prevent bending. In the <b>spring</b> loaded <b>fixture</b> a thermocouple is placed in the proximity of the actuator and temperature is measured. The different transducers are characterized using a step voltage input and an alternating current (AC) sine wave input. The step input resulted in a logarithmic rise like displacement curve, while the low frequency (< 0. 1 Hz) AC excitation generated a sine wave displacement response with a strong first harmonic. The high frequency AC excitation generated a response {{similar to that of the}} step input. Comparing the measured temperature for step and AC response demonstrated that the sample is heating up when exited with a high frequency signal; which is leading to the expansion of the sample. Initial experimental results demonstrate a strong correlation between electrode architecture and the peak strain response. Strains on the order of 2 % are observed with air stable ionic liquid based transducers. A correlation between the strain and charge buildup in the polymer is also characterized. Cesium (Cs) mobile cation outperformed all other tested mobile charges, while Potassium displaced the least.
