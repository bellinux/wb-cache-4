5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and <b>show</b> <b>what</b> {{she could do}} – which in reality was {{far more than the}} vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E

5|$|Cattle {{were raised}} at the farm. Eisenhower would often poke the rump of a bull with his shotgun to <b>show</b> <b>what</b> quality of steak the animal would {{eventually}} produce, alarming the Secret Service agents that were protecting him. Once, while barbecuing (something {{he loved to}} do on the farm), he made the mistake of announcing which cow he was cooking. As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, she was brought to tears.|$|E
5|$|Every prime, non-split {{alternating}} knot or link complement has {{a subdivision}} rule, with some tiles {{that do not}} subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement. The subdivision rules <b>show</b> <b>what</b> the night sky would look like to someone living in a knot complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo 14 {{crew members}} sampled {{boulders}} in the ejecta of Cone crater. These boulders {{appeared to be}} layered and fractured breccias, contrasting from {{the appearance of the}} surrounding area because of their older age. As these boulders increase in size and number closer to Cone crater, it is believed that they originate from the greatest depth of excavation of Cone crater. These boulders <b>show</b> <b>what</b> is believed to be general characteristics of the Fra Mauro formation: clastic texture, stratification, and jointing or fracturing.|$|E

5|$|The Critic was short-lived, {{broadcasting}} ten episodes on Fox {{before its}} cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 {{with a series}} of ten internet broadcast webisodes. The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete series release on DVD. His early 1990s shows Sibs and Phenom, both produced as part of a multi-show deal with ABC, and the 2001 <b>show</b> <b>What</b> About Joan for the same network, were all similarly short-lived.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Sarah-Jane and K9 {{returning}} to Doctor Who was {{an idea of}} Russell T Davies from pitching the show in 2003. Such a use would <b>show</b> <b>what</b> would happen after a companion left the Doctor, without dwelling {{too much on the}} classic series. It was Davies' full intention for Sarah Jane to be used for this, and while Sladen originally declined a request, thinking her role would not be important, she changed her mind when she realised she would be {{the focal point of the}} adventure. After production of the episode was finished, Sladen was approached about a full spin-off series, The Sarah Jane Adventures, which was formally announced on 14 September 2006.|$|E
5|$|The “Copper-Coloured Mountain Paradise of Padmasambahva” (Zangdopari) is vividly {{displayed}} in a heart shape on every thangkha and also painted {{on the walls of}} the monastery as a constant reminder of the legend. The paintings are set on a pedestal that represents the realm of the King of Nagas amidst Dakinis (mKha-hgro-ma), and the pinnacle in the painting denotes the domain of Brahma. The paintings also depict Klu (Naga) demigods with a human head and the body of a serpent, which are said to reside in lakes (said to denote that they are guarding the hidden treasures). Allegorically, they mean to represent the spiritual holy writings. The paintings also <b>show</b> <b>what</b> is termed as “Walkers in the Sky” (mKha-hgro-ma).|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} {{writing the}} dialogue, Takumi was called into another meeting with Inaba, {{and was told}} to add a new gameplay mechanic to the investigations. Takumi {{wanted to keep the}} gameplay simple enough for his mother {{to be able to play}} it, and keep it focused on the core concept of finding lies; according to him, he immediately had a vision of the psyche lock system during the meeting with Inaba, but still asked for three days to come up with an idea. He found it easy to formulate the idea, but it took over a month to create the system; the biggest problem was how to visually represent the psyche locks. Takumi also drew storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consisted of series of detailed drawings that <b>show</b> <b>what</b> is happening. He also drew rough sketches of cut-in illustrations; it was only decided after all the text had been written what scenes would have illustrations made for them. While the game's opening features the judge, it was originally supposed to have featured a demon instead; this was because Takumi was playing Devil May Cry at the time, and had liked its opening. As Takumi wanted the first three Ace Attorney games to be part of one larger work, he did not want the first game to look outdated in comparison to later ones, so it was decided to keep the same graphics for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth throughout all their appearances, and not make updates to them. The game's music was composed by Naoto Tanaka under the pseudonym Akemi Kimura.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. When writing the episodes, Takumi ranked each after its importance: the first episode was the most important, to make sure that the player likes the game; the second episode was the second most important, to solidify the player's interest; and the finale was the third most important. In general, each scenario was finished before anything else was done; after this, characters were designed based on the scenarios, and then Takumi adjusted dialogue as needed to make sure that it fit the designs. At this point, it was also decided what scenes were going to have specific cut-in illustrations made for them; Takumi drew rough sketches of them, and also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consist of series of detailed drawings that <b>show</b> <b>what</b> is happening.|$|E
