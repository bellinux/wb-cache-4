Kinetic data were collected using mobile force plates mounted under the toe and heel part of the binding on skies or snowboard (KISTLER). Kinematic data were collected with five synchronized, panning, tilting, and zooming cameras. An extended version of the Yeadon model was applied to calculate inertial properties of the segments. Ankle and knee joint forces and moments were calculated using inverse dynamic analysis. Results showed higher forces along the longitudinal axis in skiing and similar forces for skiing and snowboarding in anterior-posterior and mediolateral direction. Joint moments were consistently greater during a snowboard turn, but more fluctuations were observed in skiing. Hence, when comparing joint loading between carved ski and snowboard turns, one should differentiate between forces and moments, including the direction of forces and moments and the turn phase...|$|E

The hearing system of the katydid genus Neoconocephalus has two functions: intraspecific communication and predator (bat) avoidance. Male calls and bat cries differ spectrally and temporally. Katydids must recognize and discriminate between signal types. We categorized bat avoidance behaviors and examined temporal and spectral recognition of bat cries behaviorally during tethered flight in several species of Neoconocephalus. Four bat avoidance behaviors were detected in Neoconocephalus katydids; steering, wingbeat interruption, dives and leg kicks. The first three behaviors were amplitude dependent, elicited by a single ultrasound pulse while the fourth was pulse-rate dependent. <b>Steering</b> and <b>leg</b> kicks were performed consistently in all species but wingstop (wingbeat interruption or dive) occurred significantly less often in N. robustus, N. bivocatus and N. exciliscanorus, all larger species. Single pulse experiments showed that katydids respond best to pulses with relatively short rise times and a minimum duration. Spectral experiments showed that both N. exciliscanorus and N. bivocatus were relatively insensitive to higher frequencies(> 30 kHz) while N. robustus, N. retusus and N. ensiger were sensitive. Among these three species, spectral selectivity differed, with N. ensiger being very insensitive at 13 kHz while N. retusus and N. robustus remained sensitive. We discuss how differences in body size, habitat and call type might account for the differences in bat avoidance...|$|R
