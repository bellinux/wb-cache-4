40|$|Lung {{cancer has}} been the leading fatal cancer in men and women for last decades. Currently, non‐specific and non‐selective {{cytotoxic}} chemotherapy is delivered by infusion via the parenteral route and causes significant <b>systemic</b> <b>toxicities</b> to the patient with only a modest increase in survival time. Another approach consists to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs to the lung by inhalation {{in order to maximize}} local drug concentration at the tumor site and to decrease the <b>systemic</b> <b>toxicities.</b> The efficacy of inhaled temozolomide (TMZ) has previously been demonstrated on a mouse melanoma pseudometastatic lung (N. Wauthoz et al. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2011; 39 : 402 ‐ 11). In this study, TMZ dry powder formulations for inhalation were produced without or with a lipid or a lactose coating, which could influence the aerodynamic and the dissolution characteristics of the powders, and therefore their deposition and their bioactivity in the lung. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
40|$|SummaryNonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) affects {{one in three}} Americans and is a major predisposing {{condition}} for the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). We examined whether a functionally liver-targeted derivative of 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (DNP), DNP-methyl ether (DNPME), could safely decrease hypertriglyceridemia, NAFLD, and insulin resistance without <b>systemic</b> <b>toxicities.</b> Treatment with DNPME reversed hypertriglyceridemia, fatty liver, and whole-body insulin resistance in high-fat-fed rats and decreased hyperglycemia in a rat model of T 2 D with a wide therapeutic index. The reversal of liver and muscle insulin resistance was associated with reductions in tissue diacylglycerol content and reductions in protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) and PKCθ activity in liver and muscle, respectively. These results demonstrate that the beneficial effects of DNP on hypertriglyceridemia, fatty liver, and insulin resistance can be dissociated from <b>systemic</b> <b>toxicities</b> and suggest the potential utility of liver-targeted mitochondrial uncoupling agents {{for the treatment of}} hypertriglyceridemia, NAFLD, metabolic syndrome, and T 2 D...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{cancer is}} a {{potentially}} fatal disease that constitutes an important portion of tumors {{that occur in the}} head and neck region. Oral cancer can affect overall and mental health, appearance, employment, social life, and family living. The disease can cause serious changes in the functioning of the upper aero digestive tract that affects the quality of life in patients. The use of conventional treatment modalities (surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy) depends on tumor respectability and location as well as whether an organ preservation approach is feasible. However, their role in oral cancer treatment is nonselective and can cause damage to normal tissue. In particular, chemo radiotherapy is associated with <b>systemic</b> <b>toxicities</b> that often reduce patient compliance and prevent timely completion of therapy. The development of targeted therapies to target select pathways involved in carcinogenesis, potentially decrease <b>systemic</b> <b>toxicities</b> and morbidities associated with cancer burden and hence improve the prognosis in cancer patients.

However, other co-occurring exposures to pesticidal agents or in mining and smelting may contribute to these effects.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} {{development}} of dry powders for inhalation as adjuvant chemotherapy in lung cancer treatment. Cisplatin was chosen as a potential candidate for a local treatment as it remains the main platinum component used in conventional chemotherapies, despite its high and cumulative <b>systemic</b> <b>toxicities.</b> Bulk cisplatin was reduced to submicron sizes using high-pressure homogenization, mixed with a solubilized lipid and/or PEGylated component and then spray-dried to produce controlled-release dry powder formulations. The obtained formulations were characterized for their physicochemical properties (particle size and morphology), aerodynamic performance and release profiles. Cisplatin content and integrity were assessed by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry and 195 Pt nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. DPI formulations with cisplatin contents ranging from 48. 5 to 101. 0 % w/w exhibited high fine particle fractions ranging from 37. 3 % to 51. 5 % of the nominal dose. Formulations containing cisplatin microcrystals dispersed in solid lipid microparticles based on acceptable triglycerides for inhalation and PEGylated excipients showed a controlled-release for more than 24 h and a limited burst effect. These new formulations could provide an interesting approach to increasing and prolonging drug exposure in the lung while minimizing <b>systemic</b> <b>toxicities.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

We present a 71 -year-old male with grinding sensations in his right hip following ceramic-on-ceramic total hip arthroplasty (THA). After diagnosing a fractured ceramic liner, the hip prosthesis was revised into a metal-on-polyethylene bearing. At one year postoperatively, X-rays and MARS-MRI showed a fixed reversed hybrid THA, with periarticular densities, flattening of the femoral head component, and a pattern of periarticular metal wear debris and pseudotumor formation.

HF chemical burns can be treated with a water wash and 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. However, because it is absorbed, medical treatment is necessary; rinsing off is not enough. Intra-arterial infusions of calcium chloride have also shown great effectiveness in treating burns.|$|E
