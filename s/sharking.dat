DeMeo continued his drug trade despite a public prohibition that Castellano had made against this type of racket.|$|E
25|$|With {{the onset}} of Prohibition, Touhy and his {{brothers}} began distributing illegal beer and liquor in the northwest suburbs of Chicago. Touhy partnered with Matt Kolb, who was already supplying the Chicago Outfit with {{a third of its}} beer, as well as running highly profitable gambling and loan <b>sharking</b> operations north of Chicago. The two men established a brewery and cooperage, and produced a high quality beer. They soon were selling 1,000 barrels a week at $55 a barrel (for a profit of 92 percent).|$|E
25|$|The crew {{controlled}} much {{of organized}} crime throughout downtown Manhattan, and Gigante {{went on to become}} one of the most powerful caporegimes (captains) in the New York Mafia from the early 1970s until his promotion to boss in 1981. Some of the rackets included labor union control, gambling, loan <b>sharking,</b> hijackings, and extortion of businesses. Through his brother Mario, who later became a capo of his own crew, the Gigantes maintained influence in the Bronx, Yonkers and upper Westchester. Gigante's closest associates included his brother Mario Gigante, sons Andrew Gigante and Vincent Esposito, Dominick Alongi, Venero Mangano, Frank Condo, Dominick DiQuarto, Thomas D'Antonio, Frank Caggiano, Louis Manna, Giuseppe Dellacroe, Dominick Canterino, Dominick Cirillo, Joseph Denti, and Joseph Sarcinella.|$|E

25|$|Bruno had a {{reputation}} for seeking peaceful solutions to family issues instead of violence. Bruno preferred more traditional operations such as labor racketeering, illegal gambling operations, loan <b>sharking,</b> numbers games and infiltrating legitimate business. Since the late 1960s, the Philadelphia crime family used violence and intimidation to control Local 54 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. The crime family plundered the local's health and welfare funds and used its control to extort money from bars and restaurants. Family members owned or had a controlling interest in many restaurants, bars and social clubs throughout the Philadelphia/south Jersey area. During the early 1960s, the Philadelphia family was officially recognized as the Bruno family.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{not certain}} {{that the first time}} someone robs a bank they will be caught, if they {{continue}} to rob banks, they will most likely be caught. Few criminals are able to make a successful living out of bank robbery over the long run. Bank robberies are still fairly common and are indeed successful, although eventually many bank robbers are found and arrested. A report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation states that, among Category I serious crimes, the arrest rate for bank robbery in 2001 was second only to that of murder. Today most organized crime groups tend to make their money by other means, such as extortion, drug trafficking, gambling, prostitution, loan <b>sharking,</b> identity theft, or online scamming and phishing.|$|E
25|$|In May 2011, Ligambi and 14 {{other members}} and {{associates}} {{of the crime}} family were indicted by the FBI on racketeering charges related to illegal gambling operations and loan <b>sharking.</b> Seven of those indicted pleaded guilty to lesser charges. One became a government witness and seven went to trial in October 2012. The defendants were acquitted on 45 counts and found guilty on five counts, and 11 counts were undecided (hung jury). Joseph Licata was acquitted of his only charge and Staino, facing a retrial on the charges he was not convicted of, took a plea agreement for a lighter sentence. Ligambi and Borgesi beat all the remaining charges against them at a retrial and were released in January 2014.|$|E

25|$|Impressed {{with the}} young criminal, Dragna {{eventually}} made him a caporegime, placing him {{in charge of all}} of the L.A. family's interests in San Diego. Wanted for questioning in the Redondo Beach murder of mobster Les Brunemann, Frank Bompensiero left California, but was able to return in 1941 after an innocent man was convicted of Brunemann's murder. During the 1940s and 1950s, Bompensiero owned a San Diego music store with Gaspare Matranga and a horseracing wire service company. He also owned the Gold Rail cafe in downtown at the U.S. Grant Hotel, a successful business that he owned with Tom Dragna's son Frank and nephew Louis. Bompensiero and his crew also co-owned and operated several bars in the downtown San Diego area where they often conducted loan <b>sharking</b> operations.|$|E
25|$|Gaggi {{proposed}} that DeMeo be admitted into the family, but Castellano hesitated, initially {{because he felt}} DeMeo was too violent and uncontrollable. In the summer of 1977, Castellano relented and allowed DeMeo into the family. During this period, DeMeo successfully formed an alliance between the Gambino family and the Westies, a gang of Irish-American criminals that dominated the Hell's Kitchen. DeMeo continued to expand his many illegal activities and passed more money over to Gaggi. Meanwhile, Gaggi expanded his loan <b>sharking</b> business, with a large loan he secured from Montiglio, now a Gambino associate, in charge of collecting payments from DeMeo and Gaggi's customers. Montiglio's close involvement in nearly all facets of Gaggi's criminal activities, particularly with the DeMeo crew, would bring heavy repercussions for Gaggi in the mid-1980s.|$|E

He was raised a Roman Catholic. Harold Giuliani, a plumber and a bartender, had trouble holding a job, and was convicted of felony assault and robbery, serving time in Sing Sing. After his release he worked as an enforcer for his brother-in-law Leo D'Avanzo, who ran an organized crime operation involved in loan <b>sharking</b> and gambling at a restaurant in Brooklyn. The family lived in East Flatbush, Brooklyn until Harold died of prostate cancer in 1981, after which Helen moved to Manhattan's Upper East Side.

25|$|When Natale {{was arrested}} in 1998, he agreed to become a {{government}} witness and cooperate with the FBI {{in exchange for a}} light sentence and admittance into the Federal Witness Protection Program. Natale had enough of Merlino undermining him {{and did not want to}} face spending the rest of his life in prison. Between 1999 and 2001, Merlino, along with his underboss Stephen Mazzone, his consigliere George Borgesi, Martin Angelina, John Ciancaglini and others were arrested and put on trial for racketeering, illegal gambling, loan <b>sharking,</b> extortion, murder and attempted murder. Natale testified on the government's behalf, going into detail of the crimes Merlino's crew committed. Despite the prosecutions strong case, the defendants were acquitted of all murder charges. Merlino was also acquitted of narcotics trafficking charges. However, they were convicted of racketeering related charges with Merlino and Borgesi getting the longest prison sentences at 14 years each.|$|E
25|$|While Natale ran the family, Merlino and {{his young}} allies {{maintained}} control on the street, collecting extortion payments and profiting from rackets and schemes Natale was not made aware of. Merlino was also the crime family's main link {{to many of the}} other criminal groups in Philadelphia. Merlino was only 32 years old, an extremely young age for any Mafia member, let alone a leader of a Mafia family. Merlino and his allies were all young and unexperienced in running a criminal organization of such magnitude. They were also flashy, violent and loved the limelight. Merlino was often spotted by reporters and cameramen on the streets of South Philadelphia followed by a large entourage. Merlino's high-profile brought a lot of attention from the press and law enforcement. The crime family itself was unstable, with things poorly managed by Merlino's crew whose violent reputation was used to keep things in order. The Merlino faction's arrogance and aggressiveness turned off a lot of criminals from working with the crime family. Merlino's associates were also involved in drug deals in Philadelphia and Boston while overseeing the crime family's gambling, loan <b>sharking,</b> stolen goods and extortion rackets.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, the Dubois Brothers, in {{the west}} end, had become the most {{prevalent}} loan sharks using the bars they had taken as their offices in order to run their loan <b>sharking</b> business. In order for a borrower to obtain a loan they had to {{pay a visit to}} one of the Dubois Brothers offices or businesses where if the loan were approved they would either receive the money directly or delivered later to them. It was expected of the borrower to make their payments in cash to the same location that they borrowed from and the interest of the loan was substantial usually sitting around 30%. One of their associates who turned informant, Dugenais, told police that majority of the Dubois Brothers loan shark customers were taxi drivers who would take the money to go to the night clubs and racetrack. One of the clients had claimed that because he could not afford to pay his $50 debt, which he ran up playing billiards, to Adrien Dubois {{he had no choice but}} to agree to be forced into the drug trade as a drug pusher claiming that they were greedy and took more profit than they should have.|$|E
