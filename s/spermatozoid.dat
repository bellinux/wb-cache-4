40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBO) to the vigilance of <b>spermatozoids.</b> The sperm samples were obtained from the patients (n= 10) with diagnosed oligospermia. The motility of <b>spermatozoids</b> in tested samples was not lower than 30 % but it did not exceed the critical proportion of 50 %. Three groups of samples were formed, with respectively 10 samples in each group. All of them were exposed to HBO conditions of 2. 5 ATA for 90 minutes. Group I was exposed to HBO conditions without any addition of medium. Group II was added 5 ml of EBSS solution. Tyrode’s solution in volume of 5 ml was added to group III. The evaluation of functional characteristics of sperm was carried out 30 minutes after completion of HBO treatment.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{technique}} to compute the fraction of boar <b>spermatozoid</b> heads which present an intracellular density distribution pattern hypothesized as normal by veterinary experts. This approach offers a potential for digital image processing estimation of sperm capacitation which can substitute expensive staining techniques. We extract a model distribution from a training set of heads assumed as normal by veterinary experts. We also consider two other training sets, one with heads similar to the normal pattern and another formed by heads that substantially deviate from that pattern. For each <b>spermatozoid</b> head, a deviation from the model distribution is computed. This produces a conditional probability distribution of that deviation for each set. Using a set of test images, we determine the fraction of normal heads in each image and compare it with the result of expert classification. This yields an absolute error below 0. 25 in the 89 % of the samples. ...|$|E

40|$|Although age-based {{effects on}} the {{reproductive}} success of males {{have been reported in}} several animal taxa the cost of aging on male mating success in lekking species has not been fully explored. We used the Mediterranean fruit fly, a lekking species, to investigate possible cost of aging on male reproductive success. We performed no choice and choice mating tests to test the hypothesis that aging does not affect the mating performance (mating success in conditions lacking competition) or the mating competitiveness (mating success against younger rivals) of males. The mating probability of older males decreased significantly when competing with younger males. Aging gradually reduced the mating performance of males but older males were still accepted as mating partners in conditions lacking competition. Therefore, older males are capable of performing the complete repertoire of sexual performance but fail to be chosen by females in the presence of young rivals. Older males achieved shorter copulations than younger ones, and female readiness to mate was negatively affected by male age. Older and younger males transferred similar amount of <b>spermatozoids</b> to female spermathecae. Females stored <b>spermatozoids</b> asymmetrically in the two spermathecae regardless the age of their mating partner. Aging positively affected the amount of <b>spermatozoids</b> in testes of both mated and nonmated males. No significant differences were observed on the amount of <b>spermatozoids</b> between mated and nonmated males. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Ayahuasca is a psychoactive {{beverage}} used ancestrally by indigenous Amazonian tribes and, more recently, by Christian religions in Brazil {{and other}} countries. This study aimed {{to investigate the}} reproductive effects of this beverage in male Wistar rats after chronic exposure. The rats were treated by gavage every other day for 70 days at 0 (control), 1 ×, 2 ×, 4 × and 8 × the dose used in a religious ritual (12 animals per group), and animals euthanized on the 71 st day. Compared to controls, {{there was a significant}} decrease in food consumption and body weight gain in rats from the 4 × and 8 × groups, and {{a significant increase in the}} brain and stomach relative weight at the 8 × group. There was a significant increase in total serum testosterone, and a decrease in spermatic transit time and spermatic reserves in the epididymis caudae in the 4 × group, but not in the highest dose group. No significant changes were found in the other reproductive endpoints (<b>spermatozoid</b> motility and morphology, total <b>spermatozoid</b> count and daily sperm production), and histology of testis and epididymis. This study identified a no-observed-adverse-effect-level for chronic and reproductive effects of ayahuasca in male Wistar rats at 2 × the ritualistic dose, which corresponds in this study to 0. 62 mg/kg bw N, N-dimethyltryptamine, 6. 6 mg/kg bw harmine and 0. 52 mg/kg bw harmaline.

40|$|The <b>spermatozoids</b> {{of lower}} plants {{have long been}} {{recognized}} as remarkably complex motile gametes. <b>Spermatozoids</b> differ markedly from the other gametophyte cells that surround or give rise to them. Their differentiation process involves the synthesis and assembly of a complex cytoskeleton and a motile apparatus that can be simple or complex, having as few as two {{to as many as}} thousands of ciliary axonemes. An important aspect of spermiogenesis involves the de novo synthesis of basal bodies in a cytoplasmic particle known as the blepharoplast: that is, the cells that produce spermatocytes do not contain centrioles. Thus, these cells provide an ideal system in which to study the formation of basal bodies. The cytoskeletons of <b>spermatozoids</b> from different organisms display a common architecture, with a multilayered structure (MLS) at the anterior end of the cell and a dorsally situated planar ribbon of crosslinked microtubules extending the length of the elongated gamete. The function of the MLS is not known, but it could be involved in cell-body elongation during development and in the control of ciliary motility in the mature gamete, particularly during chemotaxis. The application of modern techniques on these cells can shed light on long-standing problems relating to spermiogenesis and motility...|$|R
40|$|A {{linkage map}} of 40 linkage groups (LGs) was {{developed}} for brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis, using an F 2 interstrain hybrid progeny (n = 171) and 256 coding gene SNP developed specifically for brook charr and validated from a large (> 1000) subset of putative SNP, as well as 81 microsatellite markers. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to reproduction functions, these fish were also phenotyped at six physiological traits, including <b>spermatozoid</b> head diameter, sperm concentration, plasma testosterone, plasma 11 -keto-testosterone, egg diameter, and plasma 17 β-estradiol. Five significant QTL were detected over four LGs for egg diameter and plasma 17 β-estradiol concentration in females, and sperm concentration as well as <b>spermatozoid</b> head diameter in males. In females, two different QTLs located on LG 11 and LG 34 {{were associated with the}} egg number, whereas one QTL was associated with plasma 17 β-estradiol concentration (LG 8). Their total percent variance explained (PVE) was 26. 7 % and 27. 6 %, respectively. In males, two QTL were also detected for the sperm concentration, and their PVE were estimated at 18. 58 % and 14. 95 %, respectively. The low QTL number, associated with the high PVE, suggests that the variance in these reproductive physiological traits was either under the control of one major gene or a small number of genes. The QTL associated with sperm concentration, plasma 17 β-estradiol, and egg diameter appeared to be under a dominance effect, whereas the two others were under a negative additive effect. These results show that genes underlying the phenotypic variance of these traits are under different modes of action (additive vs. dominance) and may be used to predict an increase or a decrease in their phenotypic values in subsequent generations of selective breeding. Moreover, this newly developed panel of mapped SNP located in coding gene regions will be useful for screening wild populations, especially in the context of investigating the genetic impact of massive stocking of domestic brook charr to support the angling industry throughout eastern North America...|$|E

40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, microtubules are nucleated {{and organized}} by protein structures called microtubule- organizing centers. There {{is a great}} diversity in structure and morphology of these structures in eukaryotic organisms. Animal centrosome, yeast spindle pole body and basal bodies of flagellar apparatus are the best known types of so called focused microtubule-organizing centers, where microtubules are nucleated from one or two concrete sites in the cell. These focused microtubule- organizing centers are replaced by diffuse centers in higher plant cells, which means that microtubules are nucleated from dispersed nucleation sites. Focused centers are rarely found in land plant cells. These focused centers comprise bicentrioles and blepharoplasts, which give rise to the locomotory apparatus of motile <b>spermatozoid</b> of bryophytes, pteridophytes, cycads and Ginkgo.

40|$|Liverworts are speciose, morphologically diverse, {{and members}} of an ancient lineage that is now {{recognized}} as the sister group to all other land plants. <b>Spermatozoid</b> ultrastructural characters have provided insight on interrelationships among plant {{groups as well as}} the puzzling placement of some taxa in molecular-based phylogenies. With completion of a comprehensive molecular phylogeny of liverworts based on nuclear, plastid, and mitochondrial sequences, changes in morphology of spermatozoids may be readily tracked across lineages. The research presented herein was conducted to fill in critical data on spermatogenesis in major clades of liverworts and to evaluate the evolutionary changes in these complex cells throughout the phylum. Ultrastructural studies of the locomotory apparatus in mid-stage spermatids and mature spermatozoids were conducted on Aneura pinguis, Scapania nemorea, Calypogeia mulleriana, Bazzania trilobata, and Porella platyphylla. The locomotory apparatus of the taxa examined exhibits the typical liverwort architecture, with a multilayered structure and two staggered flagella that are attached to the spline by dimorphic basal bodies. The locomotory apparatus of Aneura is unique among liverworts in that the two basal bodies are inserted at nearly the same location near the anterior of the MLS. The <b>spermatozoid</b> of all taxa are streamlined and coiled, and contain a long cylindrical nucleus, two mitochondria and a starch-filled plastid. Spermatozoids of Scapania, Porella and Bazzania coil 1. 75 revolutions, while Aneura spermatozoids coil nearly 4 revolutions. The plastid terminates the <b>spermatozoid</b> in all but Aneura, where the plastid and nucleus overlap to the terminus. A data matrix was compiled from published data and the present studies, and a list of 21 characters scored for 11 of the most completely studied taxa. Representative taxa were selected from all major clades within the liverwort phylogeny, as well as one moss, one hornwort, and two tracheophytes as outgroups. Mesquite was used to perform an ancestral state reconstruction using maximum likelihood with Mk 1 and AsymmMk parameter models. Haplomitriopsida taxa (Haplomitrium and Treubia) shared several characters including more than one plastid, more than two mitochondria, wide spline width, and left lateral curve of the lamellar strip; however, no character states were calculated to have a significant proportional likelihood value at the ancestral node. Marchantiopsida taxa (Blasia, Marchantia, Sphaerocarpos) shared several characters including a three microtubules-wide spline aperture, a notch in the lamellar strip, and a right and left taper in shape to the lamellar strip, all of which were supported with significant proportional likelihood values at the ancestral node. Jungermanniopsida taxa (Pellia, Pallavicinia, Aneura, Porella, Bazzania, Scapania) possessed a right to left taper of the lamellar strip and a spline that attached tangentially to the nucleus and were supported by significant proportional likelihood values at the ancestral node. BayesTraits was used to give estimated values of characters for the liverwort ancestor using both the directional and random walk models. Values included a spline width of 48 microtubules, a lamellar strip length of 0. 933 µm, and lamellar strip width of 1. 427 µm.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the mechanism of}} antheridial dehiscence in ferns {{for the first time}} using fluorescence microscopy as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The mechanism leading to antheridial dehiscence in Polystichum setiferum, Asplenium trichomanes and A. onopteris was found to depend on the different cellulose contents of the inner and outer walls of the ring cells detected with calcofluor white stain and the Thie´ry test. The extremely low cellulose content of the ring cell walls facing spermatozoids made them less mechanically resilient than external wall cells. When the ring cells absorbed water they expanded only into the antheridial cavity, pushing the gametes against the cap cell, which detached from the ring cell below and enabled <b>spermatozoid</b> release. The newly released spermatozoids were spherical bodies covered in cellulose fibrils.
