5|$|Early in {{the battle}} {{something}} went wrong. While engaging the French galleys the Mary Rose suddenly heeled (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed in through the open gunports. The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble {{for the safety of}} the upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. As <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over,</b> equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers shifted and came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive port side brick oven in the galley collapsed completely and the huge 360-litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above. Heavy guns came free and slammed into the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them.|$|E
60|$|Quest glanced towards Lenora. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{and took}} his arm.|$|E
60|$|Fenella came {{slowly to}} his side. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Dom," [...] {{he said at}} length; [...] "I don't {{see much}} the matter with her, except that <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> on one side a good deal, and there's {{something}} black under and around her." ...|$|R
6000|$|ANNA--[With a hard laugh.] Decent? Who {{told you}} I was? [CHRIS is sitting with bowed shoulders, {{his head in}} his hands. <b>She</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> in {{exasperation}} and shakes him violently by the shoulder.] Don't go to sleep, Old Man! Listen here, I'm talking to you now! ...|$|R
60|$|One {{afternoon}} <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> far <b>over</b> the sill, {{and she did}} {{not challenge}} and torment him as usual.|$|R
60|$|Outside {{they heard}} the sound of Mr. Sabin's stick. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> towards him.|$|E
60|$|He {{came and}} sat by her side. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{to meet his}} embrace.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{the upper part of}} the {{banisters}} and softly spoke to him.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> {{cautiously}} <b>over</b> {{the next}} edge, {{but after a}} moment or two turned and waved her hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} is the matter with Marian," [...] said <b>she,</b> and <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the skylight. [...] "Why, she has gone down {{to talk with the}} Celebrity." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{her novel}} clapped against her breast, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> winningly <b>over</b> toward Grace, and fixed {{her with her}} wide eyes, which had rings of white round the pupils.|$|R
60|$|She {{raised her}} head suddenly. We heard Lady Dennisford moving upon the terrace. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> towards me.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> him, {{one hand}} {{on the back of his}} chair, the other seeking in vain for his.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth nodded, and crumbled {{a little}} piece of roll between her fingers. Then <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the table towards Tavernake.|$|E
50|$|Mary {{is shown}} in grief and mourning, holding the body of her son on her lap, as <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> him and faces towards his crown of thorns. Christ body is emaciated, shrunken, decomposing and lacerated with the wounds of his crucifixion. Because of its small size and intimacy, the Pietà was {{probably}} not intended for a main church altar, rather for either a side altar or home altar to be viewed by those in repentance.|$|R
40|$|Sammy {{is a new}} {{registered}} nurse (RN) on the medical surgical unit. She graduated 4 months ago and just passed her NCLEX 3 weeks ago. She is excited {{to be on the}} unit for her first full shift. She met her preceptor and is going to meet the client. A quiet older gentleman (Mr. H.) who smiles and seems interested in the fact that Sammy is a new nurse. After a few hours into her shift, she enters the patient’s room. <b>She</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> the client and takes a “selfie” with Mr. H. After showing it to the client, he smiles...|$|R
6000|$|The Lady: [...] "You {{will think}} I am very stupid this morning. Won't you please {{write it down}} for me?" [...] The florist writes {{on a sheet of}} wrapping-paper, and <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> and reads: [...] "Oh! Meteor! Well, it is very striking--a little too striking. I don't like such a vivid pink, and I don't like the name. Horrid to give such a name to a flower." [...] She puts both hands into her muff, and drifts a little way off, as if to get him in a better perspective. [...] "Can't you suggest something, Mr. Eichenlaub?" ...|$|R
60|$|They wandered out on to {{a balcony}} {{where some of}} the younger people were taking ices. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the wooden rail.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} bright with triumph. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> him {{and kissed him}} on the lips. Then she sprang lightly to her feet.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{and looked}} down. He was {{apparently}} {{clinging to the}} side with his head barely reaching {{the top of the}} rail.|$|E
60|$|When Mrs. Liddell had gone, <b>she</b> {{rose and}} <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the counter. Marcella opened her burning eyes and pulled herself wearily together.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought that}} {{after that she}} must surely go away. But she did nothing of the sort. <b>She</b> came and <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the rail by my side.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Truax {{pretended not}} to hear, but <b>she</b> rose, <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> his desk, stared {{urgently}} at him, till he weakly promised: [...] "Well, I'll talk it over with Mr. Fein. But you know it wouldn't be worth a bit more salary than you're getting now. And what would I do for a secretary?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the dial's face, {{and began}} to draw the Latin numerals with her finger. So arch, withal, that I forgot my ill-humour.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> towards him. [...] "It made me {{at first}} very angry," [...] she said. He {{glanced at her}} quickly. She held up her hand.|$|E
60|$|Her {{face was}} a strange study. There was fear mingled with unwholesome curiosity, the {{heritage}} of her natural lack of refinement. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the palings.|$|E
6000|$|She {{fell back}} in her chair. [...] "In New York?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> forward <b>over</b> the table toward him, {{as if to make}} sure that she heard aright, and said, with all the keen reproach that he could have expected: [...] "In New York, Basil! Oh, how could you have let me go on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{his wife}} a black-haired woman, with a pretty foot and ankle; calls herself Athenais; and is always talking about her trente-deux ans? Why, sir, that woman was an actress on the Boulevard, when we were here in '15. She's no more his wife than I am. Delval's name is Chicot. The woman is always {{travelling}} between London and Paris: I saw she was hooking you at Calais; she has hooked ten men, {{in the course of}} the last two years, in this very way. She lent you money, didn't she?" [...] "Yes." [...] "And <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> on your shoulder, and whispers, 'Play half for me,' and somebody wins it, and the poor thing is as sorry as you are, and her husband storms and rages, and insists on double stakes; and <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> your shoulder again, and tells every card in your hand to your adversary, and that's the way it's done, Mr. Pogson." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> {{slightly}} <b>over</b> {{the little}} table, the same little table {{at which they}} had sat {{when they first met}} each other; and with no other memories but of the stones in the streets her childhood had known, in the distress of the incoherent, confused, rudimentary impressions of her travels inspiring her with a vague terror of the world she said rapidly, as one speaks in desperation: ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were tears}} in Minnie's eyes as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> him {{with one arm}} round his shoulder, but I fancied there was a flash of resentment in them too.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> him, {{took his}} head in her lap, holding his face between her two hands as she {{answered}} in a low, grave voice, very wise and old in experience: ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{passed out}} <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> towards me. She had already rung a bell, and outside I {{could hear the}} {{shuffling}} footsteps of the old servant who had admitted me.|$|E
60|$|His hand rested for {{a moment}} upon her shoulder. He drew her a little towards him. <b>She</b> {{suddenly}} laughed, <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{and kissed him on}} both cheeks, and jumped up. The trim little parlourmaid was at the door with tea.|$|R
60|$|It {{had been}} {{said that it was}} not Maruja's way to {{encounter}} man, woman, or child, old or young, without an attempt at subjugation. Strong in her power and salient with fascination, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> gently <b>over</b> the fence, and with the fan raised to her delicate ear, made him repeat his question under the soft fire of her fringed eyes. He did so, but incompletely, and with querulous laziness.|$|R
2500|$|... 20. Finale. The {{final section}} {{begins with a}} soft woodwind chord {{followed}} by harp arpeggios with a wordless choral accompaniment à bouches fermées (similar to the [...] "Humming Chorus" [...] from Puccini's later opera, Madama Butterfly) which repeats the theme from Pâle et blonde. Ophélie sings: Le voilà! Je crois l'entendre! – [...] "There he is! I think I hear him!". As <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> the water, holding onto {{the branches of a}} willow [...] with one hand, and brushing aside the rushes with the other, she repeats some of the words and the melody (Theme of Hamlet's Love) from her love duet with Hamlet in act 1 (Ophélie: Doute de la lumière – [...] "Doubt that the light illumines"). One sees her momentarily floating in her white gown, as the current carries her away. (The action follows Gertrude's description of Ophelia's death in Shakespeare's act 4, scene 7.) ...|$|R
