5000|$|As {{the white}} {{population}} began moving West, {{into the land}} formerly assigned to tribes, government policy underwent a transformation. In 1887, the Dawes Act was passed. The Dawes Act represented a shift in federal policy towards American Indians. [...] This legislation divided tribal lands <b>into</b> <b>individual</b> <b>parcels</b> to be assigned to individual tribal members. The net result was more land available for non-native settlers, and less land held by American Indians. Policies starting with and following the Dawes act attempted to eliminate native practices, cultures, and communities. Political leaders asserted that forcing American Indians to hold private property would assimilate them into the country. To facilitate this assimilation, they were given food, housing, and clothing. The aim of these policies was to “kill the Indian, save the man,” meaning to forcibly eliminate traditional cultures.|$|R

In 1903, the Takoma Park city council took over the lease given by the B & W Transit Company and the resort was closed for illegal gambling.

40|$|First paragraph: Native Americans secured an {{important}} victory in Geneva in September 1977. The United Nations held aConference on Discrimination Against Indigenous Populations in the Americas, which succeeded in pressuring the US and other governments to recognise these peoples’ special status. This {{led to a}} global regime of indigenous human rights that drew a line under a period of overt discrimination against Native Americans in the US – even if the results were far from perfect. Forty years on, Indian rights are once again backsliding alarmingly and there is again a need for international help. In the 1970 s, Native Americans were staring cultural death in the face. The US government’stermination policyof the 1950 s had sought to disband the reservation system and force Indians {{to become part of}} modern society.

30|$|A {{key issue}} {{for the future of}} Tanzanian savannah {{ecosystems}} will be the ability of local pastoralist communities to continue managing rangelands at the communal scale, rather than fragmenting rangelands into individually owned properties. Converting rangeland from communal pastures to individual properties will likely prevent the movements across large areas of land that both livestock and wildlife in semi-arid landscapes depend upon. Tanzania needs look no further for a possible future scenario than Kenyan Maasailand to the north, where the former Group Ranches have been extensively <b>subdivided</b> <b>into</b> <b>individual</b> land holdings which are of insufficient size to support pastoralist production (Kimani and Pickard 1998; Western et al. 2009 b). These processes of subdivision have been driven by weaknesses in the governance and design of the Group Ranches as collective entities, resulting in progressive loss of communal land through decisions made by local elites on the Group Ranch governing bodies (Mwangi 2007). This process of rangeland fragmentation, driven by past policy design choices by the Kenyan state, has dire implications for wildlife in key areas such as the Maasai Mara and Amboseli - also the country's most valuable wildlife tourism sites - and there is evidence of declining wildlife populations due to these land use changes (Homewood et al. 2001).|$|R
40|$|HarmVect {{is a tool}} {{simulating}} {{the introduction}} of arthropods into Belgium. An essential approach is the tool’s design in guiding the user to divide the complex arrival of the arthropod into all its potential pathways, which in their turn are further <b>subdivided</b> <b>into</b> <b>individual</b> pathway-segments. The manageable and singular pathway-segments are then used to specify which detailed data the user has to gather and feed to the tool. This information is used to simulate {{the magnitude of the}} arthropod population during the successive pathway-segments throughout each potential introduction pathway. The tool simulates the fluctuating propagule pressure throughout the successive segments of each pathway to calculate risk indices, which are then used to generate pathway risk maps of the arthropod for Belgium. The tool generates 2 types of pathway risk maps: (a) a Point-Of-Entry pathway risk map (POE) consisting of concentrated hotspots relating to the arthropod’s entry at the national borders, and (b) a Point-Of-Appearance pathway risk map (POA), successive to the POE and visualizing the locations and level at which undetected propagules of the arthropod are exposed to the outside environment throughout Belgium. In conclusion, the tool produces an establishment risk map for the arthropods, which is generated by combining the POA with a climate-suitability and host-availability map...|$|R
