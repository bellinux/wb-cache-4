This project is intended to provide engineers with a design, to consider, for a booster pump station that meets current and future water supply needs as well as provides {{easy access to the}} pump for maintenance. The current Booster Pump Station is underground which makes access by maintenance workers extremely difficult. To facilitate operation and maintenance, new upgraded pumps and a new pump house structure is being designed with an additional <b>standby</b> <b>pump</b> to meet design requirement provided in case of maintenance or failure or primary pumps. Pump capacity and housing (foundation and structure) must be adequate enough to account for demand growth, be prepared for estimated fire supply, and protect pumps and generators from the climate.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{interferometry}} in space {{depends on the}} development of lasers that can survive launch conditions and the challenging space environment during missions that could last five years or more. This paper describes the fabrication of a rugged, laser-welded package for a 200 mW, monolithic diode-pumped solid-state Nd:YAG laser operating at 13 19 nm. Environmental testing shows that the laser withstands non-operational thermal cycles over a temperature range from- 20 °C to 55 "C, and 22. 3 g-rms of random vibration, with little or no degradation of laser output power or performance. The novel packaging method employs a specially designed housing to which multi-mode or single-mode polarization-maintaining fiber pigtails can be aligned and laser-welded into place. To further enhance reliability, a redundant pumping system called the Multi-Fiber Pump Ferrule (MFPF) was developed and implemented. The MFPF allows multiple laser diode pump modules to be aligned to the laser crystal simultaneously, in order to accommodate either parallel or <b>standby</b> <b>pump</b> redundancy. This compact, lightweight design is well suited for space flight applications and the laser-welded technique can easily be adapted to a number of other fiber optic and electro-optic devices in which critical optical alignments must be maintained in a harsh environment...|$|E

30|$|Given {{that the}} time-step is {{automatically}} shortened by the hydraulic solver chosen (EPANET in this case), {{the model of}} the real system has been simplified in order to avoid excessive computational times. In particular, given that the levels in the balancing storages along the Macquarie pipeline vary rapidly, these storages were removed and the pipeline simulated with two parallel pumps, each representing the equivalent of the three stages of pumping (that is, the pump curves for Pumps M 1 a and b in Fig.  2 were adjusted such that they represented Pumps M 2 a, M 3 a and Pumps M 2 b, M 3 b as well). This simplification is considered acceptable as the pumps in series in the Macquarie pipeline will usually be operated at the same time, given that each pump will still be controlled also by the level of Suma Park Dam. Longer computational times were also caused by the small storages after the groundwater bores. The pumps used for extraction from the aquifers (Pumps G 1 a, G 2 a and G 3 a in Fig.  2) operate at relatively consistent rates, and as such they could be removed from the model and their energy use accounted for relative to the volume pumped from the second pump in each system (Pumps G 1 b, G 2 b and G 3 b respectively). To take into account the limited volume available from the groundwater bores, the storage tanks in the groundwater system each had a volume equivalent to a year’s allocation for the respective bores. All of the stormwater pumps except for Pump S 2 c and Pump S 3 c, which are <b>standby</b> <b>pumps</b> and not in use, were included in the model. As well as the operating point of the pumps changing depending on the number of pumps used in parallel, there may be slight differences in efficiency and therefore energy use, and thus including all pumps here provided more accuracy.|$|R

50|$|Following {{condensation}} of the {{low pressure}} exhaust steam in the condenser, the feed water is passed to a condensate sump mounted under the condenser. From this receiver the condensate is drawn by one or two extraction pumps and passed through a discharge strainer. The low pressure feed heating system consists of five Direct Contact heaters with one high level deaerator to provide a high feed pump suction head. The Direct Contact L.P. heaters are arranged in two banks, comprising three and two heaters respectively. Within each bank the heaters are stacked above each other so that the condensate drains from the lower pressure heater below by gravity. The heights of the heaters are approximately inversely proportional to the bled steam pressures. The advantages of Direct Contact heaters are essentially that thermal efficiency is improved, capital cost is reduced due to fewer numbers of extraction pumps being required, and the system is entirely ferrous. The main extraction pump discharges the condensate to No.1 D.C. heater from which it cascades down to No.2 and then to No.3 D.C. heater by gravity. Two lift pumps deliver the condensate to No.4 D.C. heater, from which it cascades through No.5 D.C. heater to two deaerator lift pumps. The deaerator lift pumps discharge the condensate to the deaerator and from there it passes to the boiler feed pump suction main through microwire and magnetic filters. The main boiler feed pump is driven by a steam turbine which receives its steam from the main H.P. turbine exhaust. It comprises a single cylinder eleven stage turbine turning at 5,000 rev/min (31.42 Rad/min) and driving a multi-stage pump to give a delivery pressure of 2,067 tonne/m2 (2,940 lbf/in2). Two electrically driven Starting and <b>Standby</b> feed <b>pumps</b> are provided. The high pressure heating system consists of two parallel banks of two heaters being numbered 7 and 8 stages in the system. Each of the H.P. heaters is vertical and of the non-contact type. From the H.P. heaters the condensate, at a temperature of 253 degrees Celsius (455 degrees Fahrenheit), is passed into the boiler economiser. During unit shutdowns {{the whole of the}} feed system can be ‘blanketed’ with nitrogen gas. This is an attempt to reduce the rate at which copper and ferrous oxides form, hence reduce the ‘carrying over’ of these oxides to the boiler drum. Boiler feed water make-up is supplied by the Water Treatment Plant. This has a continuous rating of 3,672,000 Litres (970,000 gallons) in 24 hours at 153,300 Litres (40,500 gallons) per hour. The plant comprises three groups of cation, anion and mixed bed ion exchange resin units, together with vacuum degassing and pressure filtering plant. Each group processes 76,650 Litres (20,250 gallons) per hour and normally two groups are in service at one time, with the third on standby or being regenerated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Collection and pumping {{of waste}} water {{represents}} a significant cost for urban communities in Australia. The flows in a sewerage system are not constant. In residential areas flows {{will be at}} a maximum {{in the morning and}} evening. Additionally during rain periods there is an increase of flow into the pump stations due to faults in the gravity sewers allowing inflows and infiltration. It is common for multiple pump stations to feed into the same pressure main. This causes the pressure in the common pressure main to change depending on how many and which pumps are operating at any given time. Consequently the pump stations feeding into the common pressure main will operate at various flows. A given pump station will operate against maximum pressure during wet weather when all other pump stations are also operating, resulting in a decrease in the flow rate produced by the pump station. This is not desirable as the largest flow outputs are needed during wet weather conditions. The purpose of this project is to devise an alternative pump configuration. The configuration will enable pumps to operate within their recommended operating range for normal and wet weather operating conditions. The design must comply with the current standards required by the waste water industry. It must also be cost competitive compared with current pump station designs, and be able to be operated and maintained effectively in a similar manner to existing designs. The selected pump configuration consisted of three identical pumps. For normal dry weather operation each pump operates as a stand alone unit (i. e., duty / standby / <b>standby).</b> The <b>pumps</b> are equipped with piping and valving to enable two pumps to operate in series to deliver the higher pressures needed during wet weather operation. (i. e., duty / duty / standby). A prototype of this series pump configuration was designed and built. The prototype was run in a test tank to compare measured and theoretical pump performance. The tests undertaken in the test tank indicated that the pump configuration performed as predicted and it was therefore suitable for installation in an operating sewerage pump station. The prototype pumps were installed in an existing sewerage pump station in July 2007. Monitoring of the performance showed that the pumps successfully operated within their recommended operating range for normal dry weather operation and for simulated wet weather operation. There has been no evidence of increased susceptibility to blockage with this pump configuration. The proposed series pump arrangement appears to meet the goal of providing a cost effective alternative that uses identical fixed speed pumps. Each pump operates within the recommended range above and below the best efficiency point under all flow conditions. Longer term field testing is needed to demonstrate satisfactory reliability and performance of the pumps over an extended period...|$|R
