50|$|<b>Silicone</b> <b>resins</b> {{are partly}} organic in nature with a {{backbone}} polymer structure made of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms {{rather than the}} familiar carbon-to-carbon backbone characteristics of organic polymers. In addition to having at least one oxygen atom bonded to each <b>silicone</b> atom, <b>silicone</b> <b>resins</b> have direct bonds to carbon and therefore also known as polyorganosiloxanes. They have the general formula (R2SiO)n and the physical form (liquid, gel, elastomer or solid) and use varies with molecular weight, structure (linear, branched, caged) and nature of substituent groups (R = alkyl, aryl, H, OH, alkoxy). Aryl substituted <b>silicone</b> <b>resins</b> have greater thermal stability than alkyl substituted <b>silicone</b> <b>resins</b> when polymerised (condensation cure mechanism) at temperatures between ~300 °F (~150 °C) and ~400 °F (~200 °C). Heating above ~600 °F (~ 300 °C) converts all silicone polymers into ceramics since all organic constituents pyrolytically decompose leaving crystalline silicate polymers with the general formula (-SiO2-)n. In addition to applications as ceramic matrix composite precursors, <b>silicone</b> <b>resins</b> {{in the form of}} polysiloxane polymers made from <b>silicone</b> <b>resins</b> with pendant acrylate, vinyl ether or epoxy functionality find application as UV, electron beam and thermoset polymer matrix composites where they are characterised by their resistance to oxidation, heat and ultraviolet degradation.|$|R

5000|$|As mineral paint coats are not {{prone to}} static {{charging}} and thermo-plasticity (stickiness developing under heat), which {{is common for}} surfaces coated with dispersion or <b>silicone</b> <b>resin,</b> soiling takes place to lesser extent [...] For this reason fewer dirt particles cling {{to the surface and}} are far easier to wash off.

50|$|The {{result is}} a highly durable {{connection}} between paint coat and substrate. Above that the binding agent water glass is highly resistant against UV light. While organic binders such as dispersions based on acrylate or <b>silicone</b> <b>resin</b> under UV over the years tend to grow brittle, chalky and develop cracks which finally result in damage to paint coats, the inorganic binder water glass remains stable. The chemical fusion with the substrate and the UV stability of the binder are the fundamental reasons for the extraordinarily high lifetime of silicate paints.|$|E

The windshield, installed with <b>silicone</b> <b>resin</b> instead of a rubber gasket, was large, sloped and characterized by a single wiper, a functional and practical solution. The side was kept very clean and is characterized by a belt line from the base of the hood rising gradually as it approaches the lower edge of the tailgate, delimited by the wrap-around taillights.

5000|$|The LED {{filament}} {{is composed}} {{of a series of}} LEDs on a transparent substrate, referred to as Chip-On-Glass (COG). These transparent substrates are made of glass or sapphire materials. This transparency allows the emitted light to disperse evenly and uniformly without any interference. An even coating of yellow phosphor in a <b>silicone</b> <b>resin</b> binder material converts the blue light generated by the LEDs into white light. Degradation of silicone binder, and leakage of blue light are design issues in LED filament lights. Positive benefits of the LED design are potential higher efficiencies by the use of more LED emitters from lower driving currents.

40|$|Silicones {{are widely}} used in the coating {{industries}} as materials to protect and preserve but also to bring style {{to a wide variety}} of applications in our daily lives. The unique combination of properties of silicones is well suited to coating applications. Two families of products are used: silicone polymers as additives and <b>silicone</b> <b>resins</b> as the main component, or binder. At low levels, silicone polymers are used to ease application of paints. The surface properties of silicones enable a paint to wet a substrate easily and give it a smooth appearance once dry. Here silicones are behaving as performance-enhancing additives during the coating application. They are effective at an addition level of a fraction of a percent (see Table 1). In contrast to the low-level use of silicone polymers as additives, <b>silicone</b> <b>resins</b> can be major components of the coating. Here they are used as binders or co-binders, imparting important benefits such as durability throughout the life of the coating. <b>Silicone</b> <b>resins</b> offer resistance to weathering in paints for exterior surfaces such as bridges and metal cladding on buildings. They also provide water repellence to masonry surfaces such as stone and brick. <b>Silicone</b> <b>resins</b> have greater resistance to high temperatures than organic resins and are used in paints for ovens, chimneys, car exhausts and barbecues. In these examples, the resilience of the silicone materials allows reduced frequency of maintenance painting and consequently reduced volumes of paint used over the lifetime of the coated item (see Table 1) ...|$|R
50|$|Capacitance errors. Microelectrodes are capacitors, and are {{particularly}} troublesome {{because they are}} non-linear. The capacitance arises because the electrolyte inside the electrode is separated by an insulator (glass) from the solution outside. This is, by definition and function, a capacitor. Worse, as {{the thickness of the}} glass changes the farther you get from the tip, the time constant of the capacitor will vary. This produces a distorted record of membrane voltage or current whenever they are changing. Amplifiers can compensate for this, but not entirely because the capacitance has many time-constants. The experimenter can reduce the problem by keeping the cell's bathing solution shallow (exposing less glass surface to liquid) and by coating the electrode with <b>silicone,</b> <b>resin,</b> paint, or another substance that will increase the distance between the inside and outside solutions.|$|E
40|$|We {{have tried}} to prepare the porous <b>silicone</b> <b>resin</b> sheet with the phase {{inversion}} method in pa-rallel with the non solvent induced phase separation method. In the experiment, ethyl acetate and water were adopted as a good solvent and a poor solvent for <b>silicone</b> <b>resin,</b> respectively and ethyl alcohol as an amphiphilic solvent was used to increase the solubility of ethyl acetate in water and decrease the interfacial tension by mass transfer from water to ethyl acetate. The concentration of <b>silicone</b> <b>resin</b> in ethyl acetate and the oil soluble surfactant species were changed. Increasing the concentration of <b>silicone</b> <b>resin</b> could depress coalescence between the water droplets in the (W/O) dispersion and increase the porosity and pore number density of <b>silicone</b> <b>resin</b> sheet.
