S. wheat disappearance in 2005 / 06 {{is expected to}} decline more than supplies, resulting in {{a small amount of}} <b>stock-building.</b> With the higher stocks-to-use ratio, the season-average farm price is projected to decline. World wheat prices during the fall of 2004 were not much changed compared with the previous year, but were high enough to encourage expanded plantings in some countries. However, normal weather is unlikely to replicate last yearâ€™s record foreign wheat yield, so global wheat production is expected to decline some in 2005 / 06. Assuming tren...|$|E
30|$|The {{novelty of}} this study is that {{employing}} the structural time series analysis with the means of the cycles for wheat and an irregular component for rice gives size and shape to the factors that affect price formation. The instability of prices and their effect on the trend affect less developed countries to a greater extent than the more developed countries. The same applies to the poorer and richer consumers within a country. However, knowledge of the structure of the two price series will enhance the efforts of policy makers to counterbalance the negative effects of the cyclicality of wheat prices and the vulnerability of rice prices to exogenous factors. More specifically, when policy makers were faced with increased prices that threatened the food security of their countries they resorted to counter measures that only helped in the short term, such as export bans and subsidized prices. However, sooner rather than later, these measures lost their effectiveness, and in the absence of long-term measures, social unrest increased while the costs created deficits. Since, this study shows that wheat prices are affected by short-run fluctuations that govern the price formulation in the long run, it is evident that short-run measures should be enhanced from longer term ones, as well. The main measure to be taken would be stock building. Before the correlated price spikes in agricultural commodities, trade was a good alternative measure; however, the experiences of 2008 have revealed that at times when the international markets are closed to poor countries due to high prices and reduced trading, increased stocks are valuable for securing the food supply for these countries (Gilbert and Morgan, 2010). Since <b>stock-building</b> is an expensive and inflexible measure, and thus difficult for poorer countries to adopt, the aim of governments should be joint <b>stock-building</b> with other net-importing countries. Moreover, the involvement of the private sector in stock building could ease the burden for governments. Furthermore, policy measures with the same rationale should be developed by less developed countries so that they will be able to have access to the hedging markets of futures and options. On the other hand, richer countries are not so worried about their food security as much as the effects of food prices on inflation. Despite the fact that developed countries are both more open to world markets and more capable of isolating their farmers from world market volatility, they would also benefit from cooperating with the less developed countries on mitigating the undesirable effects of high food prices.|$|E
