40|$|The {{results of}} a number of studies which have {{indicated}} the limited effectiveness of health education efforts using the mass media are reviewed. The cause of these failures, according to the authors was the inability to apply a number of principles of effective design to the instructional materials used in the mass media. The basic slide show produced by the neighborhood health center for its own population may be more effective than a nationally televised <b>spot</b> <b>announcement</b> because locally prepared material can be sharply focused on the learner's characteristics and the specifically desired outcome behavior. The authors list 10 guidelines for the construction of effective instructional materials: define outcome measures, analyze relevant characteristics of the learner, gain and maintain the learner's attention, establish the learner's vulnerability, demonstrate the needs for action, establish the learner as an agent, establish the learner's effectiveness, provide for practice, repeat key facts, and generalize to similar situations. The principles of social reinforcement that must accompany health education instruction if behavior is to be modified are outlined. How environmental factors such as time, distance, expense, and the organization of health services hamper desired behavior outcomes is also discussed...|$|E

What was wanted were people who could speak the Russian language, to participate in an expedition to Chukotka. Since this place was a remote border region with restricted access, she could not resist the temptation. After the expedition was over, she remained there for some time, just hanging around. Later she wrote her MA thesis on the material she had collected during the expedition. The visual material that had accumulated she put to good use, when she later sought financing for this document. The Bering Strait area made a great impression on Jääskeläinen, “one had a feeling that one’s soul really can be at peace here”.|$|R

50|$|Jacobs' {{record in}} the NHL is unclear. Jacobs was invited to the Torontos' {{training}} camp in December 1918.

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1946 Sears was more {{noticeable}} in public, working for various {{radio and television}} stations. He worked at WPEN AM radio, and by 1948 at WCAU-TV, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In between, in February 1947, Marguerite led a class in radio production at Green Acre Bahá'í School in Maine for which Sears acted as narrator and consultant before airing on WHEB and by June Sears produced a set of radio <b>spot</b> <b>announcements</b> and national radio shows for the religion. For commercial work he did various shows including The Bill Sears Show, {{while at the same}} time his first booklet publication came out: The Martyr-Prophet of a World Faith, a 19-page work with quotes from A. L. M. Nicholas, Francis Younghusband, E. G. Browne, and then for WCAU Kid Gloves {{while at the same time}} Sears taped an interview of Hand of the Cause Corinne True about her pilgrimage in 1907. In December 1951 he began to host a television show In The Park initially on WCAU as a 15-minute program which was picked up by WCBS-TV as a 30-minute live program. It featured conversations between Sears and puppets by Paul Ritts and Mary Donnelly [...] "… Sears (dressed in suit jacket, vest, string tie, and hat) as he sat leisurely on a bench and conversed with his puppet friends" [...] in the Central Park Zoo. In July 1952 the show was advertised as costing $3250 to produce per week. At the same time as the show was coming along, Sears was included in a profile of thinkers by Edward R. Murrow in his This I Believe radio series though none of the participants were allowed to name their religion, (the series published as a book, with Sears' entry on pp. 167-8, and released on the internet circa 2005.) Sears began to give more public talks for the religion covered in the newspapers beginning with a funeral in Maine in summer of 1952. The Ten Year Crusade, a major initiative to bring the religion to countries around the world, was announced in October and would soon figure prominently in the Sears' plans. In the Park was noted in many newspaper stories in December 1952 related to The Ed Sullivan Show, and actually appeared twice on the show [...] - [...] January and March 1953. Coverage of In the Park continued into May. Meanwhile, he was attending the May 2 dedication of the Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette. Progress in organizing the efforts of the Ten Year Crusade included the opportunity for Marguerite to attend the February conference of Bahá'ís in Uganda. When Sears asked to leave his contract so he could go to Africa he was threatened with the fact that 56 people would lose their jobs. Meanwhile, the sponsor had a strike, canceled the contract, and the family left. The puppets went on to other shows.|$|R
40|$|This written thesis accompanies three {{television}} {{public service}} <b>announcement</b> <b>spots.</b> Two of the spots are 60 seconds {{and one of}} the spots is 45 seconds in length. I produced this public service television advertising campaign to highlight the issue of child illiteracy in Pakistan and to encourage expatriate and resident Pakistani's to donate to educational charities. A Website created by the filmmaker is promoted in the campaign. This Website provides information about various charities that educate children in Pakistan. Detailed accounts of pre-production, production and post-production of the campaign allow the viewer to comprehend the challenges in producing television campaigns for social causes. Theoretical issues are also discussed, including the causes of illiteracy, the importance and role of social campaigns, the history and uses of propaganda as well as the aesthetic concerns of a public service campaign producer. I discuss the importance of creating the culture of public service campaigns in a third world country like Pakistan, and states that the Pakistani community needs to look inwards to overcome the challenge of illiteracy...|$|R
40|$|The current {{practical}} {{communication management}} master’s thesis focuses on connections between strategic business {{management and the}} use of social media. The objective of the thesis is to describe how can an enterprise succeed in promoting its ideals and achieving strategic goals with the help of social media. Namely, what are the concrete measures to be put in action and what principles should be followed due course. The theoretical findings where tested analyzing the strategic goals of NASDAQ OMX Tallinn in order to bring forth the ones that can benefit from the use of different social media channels. The first part of the thesis draws on the theoretical implications about information society (following the works of M. Castells and M. Listner on network society) and strategic business management (based on the findings of M. E. Porter, C. K. Prahalad ja M. S. Krishnan). Close attention is given to the aspects of community creation, discussion and deliberation, sociotechnological and cultural change, communication technologies. Social media is believed to serve the ideals of information society while enhancing the inclusion and interaction of users, exchange of ideas and joint creation processes. Potential threats of new media are also described in addition to the positive scenario. Those include issues of anonymity, trust and accessibility. The thesis also examines the reciprocity of economy and information society. The companies that use social networks to guide the clients to consumption or to achieve more effective marketing with the help of network data are more profitable. Networking environments, previously the playground of subcultures, have become capitalistic. The tendency is to move away from large markets, trying to offer a wider array of products. The analysis again also points out the risks of which most important are creation of false necessities and downgrading active citizens to consumers. While the centerpoint of the thesis is organizational strategy, main attention is given to a key management issue – incapability of making a distinction between efficiency and strategy. Doing the job better is what constitutes efficiency, but strategic positioning denotes being unique in the manner of carrying out actions (different or similar to the competitors). Picking a strategic course and implementing it includes positioning the business and considering the environment, making compromises, applying suitable measures and management. One option for creating a strategy is to use R=G (Resources=Global) and N= 1 (The Segment of One) approach which focuses on not possession but accessibility of resources and the ability to work with the clients for company’s added value. The second half of the theoretical part explores social media which {{has been described as a}} combination of user created content and an environment to share that. Broadly speaking, social media is created by the society and not different technologies or software. Although networks, their functionalities and goals change over time, the author sees the social media networks as a source of well-informed and active clients that make use of digital technologies, complemented by open and free access to information. Customers wish to be involved in product/service development and the businesses can provide a suitable platform. The second part of the thesis presents secondary analysis of previous studies and also the outcomes of original research conducted for the thesis. The latter consisted of an opinion poll (with ES Turuuuringud) about the usage of social media and its reliability and semi-structured expert interviews with social media opinion leaders in Estonia and the board members of NASDAQ OMX Tallinn. The goal was to map the strategic potential of social media. The synthesis of previous studies on Estonian internet users and their practices shows that the social media are mostly used for entertainment, spare time activities, information gathering and social purposes involving friends and acquaintances. Users find media channel’s credibility and reliability important while it is providing new and diverse information as quick as possible and blocking excessive and unwanted content in order to get an adequate reflection on the world beyond the net. The enterprises are beginning to understand the potential of social media and appreciate it as a means of communication. The usage has mostly been limited to short-term marketing activities to this day. The focus has been more on informative and monetary (sales) messages and less on practical and entertainment value that users expect. One of the key questions under study is about the reliability of social media channels. Research shows that the most trust is put on expert opinions, followed by friends’ suggestions leaving the last <b>spot</b> for official <b>announcements</b> of enterprises. The reliability of the channel itself came after printed media and before commercials. The attitude towards companies’ social media channels is neutral while many respondents where not able to give any judgement which is evidence of considerable potential. The results of expert interviews show that Estonian enterprises are still in the test phase of using social media. The use of social media serves mostly marketing or communication purposes, not long term strategic goals or the ideals of social media – inclusion and joint creative processes. The experts see the lack of knowledge and skills as an obstacle. Outcome evaluation is absent since the strategic planning is not a priority. The opportunities of NASDAQ OMX Tallinn to use social media for reaching strategic goals is explored in the last section of the thesis. The author finds the social media to be most suitable for objectives connected to educating future investors. Investor development entails information, training and exploring specific investment nuances and backgrounds. The social media channels also provide feedback from population on developments of stock market. The information is of great value when the company is drafting a strategy, objectives or action plans according to the market expectation. The thesis concludes with encouraging businesses for wider use of social media and not only for marketing and sales purposes. It is important to outline the opportunities and set strategic goals that the social media’s ideals – inclusion and joint creative processes – could help realizing. The thesis gives a number of advice (in chapter 5. 3) to be considered for making the most of social media. Social media channels can be used in every business sector and for almost every strategic goal. Though making first sure that those are the easiest and most efficient means...|$|R
