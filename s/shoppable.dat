40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. May 2011. Major: Design. Advisor: Kim K. P. Johnson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 79 pages, appendix 74 - 79. The {{purpose of this}} study was to assess consumers‟ approach and avoidance behaviors towards lifestyle and <b>shoppable</b> product displays as mediated by their emotional states and moderated by their convenience orientation and hedonic shopping value. Virtual depictions of four types of product displays (non-lifestyle-non-shoppable, non-lifestyle-shoppable, lifestyle-non-shoppable, and lifestyle-shoppable) were included in questionnaires and completed by 157 participants. ANOVA results indicated a significant effect of lifestyle product display on participants‟ experienced cognitive pleasure and a significant effect of <b>shoppable</b> product display on participants‟ experienced pleasure, arousal, and cognitive pleasure. Participants who viewed the lifestyle-shoppable product display experienced significantly more pleasure, arousal, and cognitive pleasure than those who viewed the non-lifestyle-non-shoppable product display. The lifestyle-shoppable product display also evoked more arousal in participants than the lifestyle-non-shoppable product display. This research supports the S-O link of the S-O-R model (Mehrabian & Russell, 1974). Findings have implications for future researchers interested in studying new product display types. It also has practical implications for retailers that sell apparel as part of a wide product assortment or any retailer looking to implement product displays that evoke emotional responses in consumers...|$|E
