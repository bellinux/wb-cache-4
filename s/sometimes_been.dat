5|$|Some marine halfbeaks, {{including}} Euleptorhamphus velox and Euleptorhamphus viridis, {{are known}} for their ability to jump {{out of the water and}} glide over the surface for considerable distances, and have consequently <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> called flying halfbeaks.|$|E

5|$|Although {{this bird}} eats rice on the {{wintering}} grounds, {{where it can}} make up nearly 40% of its diet, it takes mainly waste and residues from cropping and threshing, not harvestable grain. It has <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> viewed as a pest, but the deeper water and presence of invertebrate prey in the economically important early winter period means that the wader has little effect on crop yield.|$|E

5|$|Because LARP {{involves}} a controlled artificial environment within which people interact, it has <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> {{used as a}} research tool to test theories in social fields such as economics or law.

5|$|Brideshead Revisited (1981), {{based on}} Waugh's novel; a miniseries {{enormously}} popular in Britain and America, {{the film has}} <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> seen as drawing unwanted attention to Oxford's stereotypical reputation as a playground for the upper class. It stars Jeremy Irons and most college shots are of Christ Church and Hertford.|$|E
5|$|Bromine has <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> {{considered}} to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported by only limited circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.|$|E

5|$|Events in {{southern}} Britain to 796 have <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> {{portrayed as a}} struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity in their power was enormous. By 796 Charlemagne had become master of an empire which stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Hungarian Plain, and Offa and then Coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock has <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> {{labelled}} cock {{rock for}} {{its emphasis on}} overt masculinity and sexuality and because it has historically been predominantly performed and consumed by men: {{in the case of}} its audience, particularly white, working-class adolescents.|$|E
5|$|Helpers, {{offspring}} {{from the}} previous brood, have <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> noted to assist in feeding the fledglings at the nest of their parents. Cases of brood parasitism by the Asian koel have been noted. An average breeding success of 44% has been noted with {{the main cause of}} fledgling mortality being shortage of insect food which in turn was dependent on rainfall.|$|E

5|$|In the past, other dromaeosaurid species, {{including}} Deinonychus antirrhopus and Saurornitholestes langstoni, have <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> classified in {{the genus}} Velociraptor. Since Velociraptor {{was the first to}} be named, these species were renamed Velociraptor antirrhopus and V. langstoni.

5|$|Intermediate birds occur {{where the}} {{recognised}} forms meet and interbreed, and have <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> given subspecies status, including S. b. kreczmeri in Poland and S. b. pateffi in Bulgaria, {{but these are}} not generally accepted as valid taxa.|$|E
5|$|Later in the 20th century, as disruptively {{patterned}} uniforms became widespread, winter {{variants of}} patterns such as Flecktarn were developed, the background colour (such as green) being replaced with white {{to form a}} Schneetarn (snow camouflage pattern).

5|$|Muskrats have <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> a food {{resource}} for North Americans. In the southeastern portion of Michigan, a longstanding dispensation allows Catholics to consume muskrat as their Friday penance, on Ash Wednesday, and on Lenten Fridays (when the eating of meat, except for fish, is prohibited); this tradition {{dates back to}} at least the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, blue collar foreign workers have <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> unable to collect {{salaries}} due {{even when the}} Saudi Labor Office has ruled in their favor, since employers can stall payment until the worker' work permits have expired.|$|E
