Billy, while not quite as successful as his brother, went on to play 12 years in the major leagues. Cal Sr. also had two older brothers, Oliver and Bill.|$|E
5|$|The strongest tornado in the United States during 2015 {{first began}} at 6:39p.m. CDT (23:39UTC) on April9, just {{northeast}} of Franklin Grove, Illinois. It touched down over a field, producing swirls in crops, before moving northeast and causing EF1 damage to Crest Foods plant. The tornado soon exited Lee County and entered Ogle County, inflicting EF1 damage to two farm outbuildings that were completely destroyed and EF0 {{damage to a}} similar structure that had a portion of its roof uplifted. Intensifying to EF3 strength, much more severe damage was noted along South Skare Court as the tornado entered an area of semi-rural subdivisions to the northwest of Rochelle. A few homes in this area were destroyed at EF3 intensity, with other homes nearby sustaining EF2 damage. One large house had a room ripped off on its second floor, while a <b>split-level</b> home was almost completely leveled.|$|E

5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the <b>split-level</b> kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E

It reads: [...] "Don't Waste Words, Jump to Conclusions".|$|R
50|$|Madonna Acres Ranch and Split Level {{houses are}} well-preserved and contain modern {{architectural}} elements, a notable {{difference from the}} traditional styles and detailing found in white subdivisions of the same period. The typical Madonna Acres Ranch is side-gabled with a living room picture window and an integrated one-car carport, although there are several asymmetrical front-gabled Ranches as well. The <b>Split-Levels</b> have a one-story main level with a living room, dining room, and kitchen aside a split level two-story wing with bedrooms and a den.|$|R

25|$|Frasier's {{apartment}} {{was designed to}} be ultra-modern in an eclectic style (as Frasier himself points out in the pilot). One of the show's signature elements that it became well known for was the apartment's design which included elements such as a slightly <b>split-level</b> design, doors with triangular wooden inlay features, numerous pieces of well-known high-end furniture pieces (such as a replica of Coco Chanel's sofa, and both Eames and Wassily Chairs) and a notable view from the terrace which was frequently complimented by visitors. The main set consisted of the open-concept living area with a sitting/TV space and dining area on the lower level and a piano exit to the terrace on the rear upper level. The set also included the kitchen through an open archway. A small section of the building corridor and elevator doors was built, as was a powder room near the front entrance. Two corridors off the living area ostensibly led to the apartment's three bedrooms. Sets for each of these rooms were built as separate sets on an as-needed basis.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{proposals}} however {{to return}} Dizengoff Square {{to its original}} state in order to restore its popularity. In 2007, Tel Aviv's municipal engineer, Hezi Berkovich, explained how they wanted to [...] "avoid <b>split-levels,</b> raised or sunken, {{in the center of}} town, and currently the square cuts off the line of sight that is so important for pedestrians, who do not walk along the street sidewalks and do not enjoy them. They simply go up and down at the square. Over the years, the square and the houses surrounding it deteriorated together". In addition, they would want to move Agam's sculpture elsewhere in Tel Aviv.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tower was}} briefly the tallest {{building}} in Frankfurt until {{the construction of}} the City-Haus. The north side of the tower housed the library of the social sciences, as well as seminar rooms with 1.5 times the floor height. The south side consisted of offices only a single floor high, which required an intricate system of staircases and <b>split-levels</b> between the two halves, considerably complicating orientation. After the construction, a cafeteria was established in the top floor, but was closed for lack of popularity. This floor was not accessible with all lifts, and was considered a hard-to-find secret due to the good view in all directions. The student-managed TuCa (Tower Café) on the ground floor was cleared by the police {{at the behest of the}} university administration, in order to open a café managed by the Studentenwerk, named the C'AfE. Since the beginning of 2007, the TuCa sat [...] "in exile" [...] on the fifth floor.|$|R
5000|$|Rainier Valley {{is known}} for a roughly 1/4 split between whites, blacks, Asians, and Hispanics (though the {{statistics}} noted above are a little different) and for the relative harmony between these groups. Italians were prominent in the early 1900s and some could argue set the harmonious tone of the Valley that survives to this day. However, most of the Italians, with some notable exceptions, left the Valley in the 1960s. However, while Italians were prominent in the north Valley in the early 20th century, the Central Valley (Columbia City and thereabouts) was mostly settled by the same midwestern folk and northern-European immigrants (primarily British and Scandinavian) who settled {{most of the rest}} of Seattle. Notwithstanding these generalizations, there have always been Asians in the Valley, with Japanese farmers living in the Valley (attracted by the same thing the Italians were, the rich Valley bottomland) since its inception - there were two historic Japanese-American nurseries in the Valley - Mizukis and Holly Park, with Holly Park Nursery a vibrant presence to this day. It is tough to describe the Valley, but it can be said that the construction of the Holly Park and Rainier Vista housing projects World War II to house war workers were seminal events. Following the war and until the Boeing crash of 1971, the Valley boomed with middle-class residential construction (many post-war <b>split-levels</b> dot the valley) and with all of this construction, the Valley continued its historic diversity. [...] Interracial couples in the 1950s found the Valley more accepting than the northern half of the city because of the relative lack of [...] "deed covenants" [...] found in the South End (covenants ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in the 1960s).|$|R
500|$|Another {{species of}} dromaeosaurid, Microraptor gui, {{may have been}} capable of gliding using its {{well-developed}} wings on both the fore and hind limbs. A 2005 study by Sankar Chatterjee suggested that the wings of Microraptor functioned like a <b>split-level</b> [...] "biplane", and that it likely employed a phugoid style of gliding, in which it would launch from a perch and swoop downward in a 'U' shaped curve, then lift again to land on another tree, with the tail and hind wings helping to control its position and speed. Chatterjee also found that Microraptor had the basic requirements to sustain level powered flight in addition to gliding.|$|E

2500|$|Junction 15 of the M5 {{is a large}} four level stack interchange, {{called the}} Almondsbury Interchange, where the M5 meets the busy M4. The Avonmouth Bridge, between Junctions 18 and 19, is often a {{bottleneck}} during heavy traffic periods, due mainly to lane drops at either ends of the bridge for the respective junctions, and the sharp angle in {{the centre of the}} bridge, which causes larger vehicles to slow considerably. [...] There are <b>split-level</b> carriageways where the M5 ascends the hill sides above the Gordano Valley, between Portishead, Junction 19 and Clevedon, Junction 20. Junction 1 surrounds a surviving gatehouse from the former Sandwell Hall.|$|E
2500|$|Houston ISD's {{administration}} building from July 1970 to March 2006 was the [...] Hattie Mae White Administration Building, at 3830 Richmond Avenue. The facility was labeled the [...] "Taj Mahal" [...] {{due to the}} counter-clockwise circular layout and the <b>split-level</b> floor pattern. The design {{made it difficult for}} wheelchair-using individuals to navigate the building. The complex cost U.S.$6 million. The building had tropical indoor atriums, causing critics to criticize the spending priorities of the district. When the district considered cutting a popular kindergarten program for financial reasons, taxpayers voted many board members out of office. The district sold the former complex for $38 million to a company that demolished the site and developed a mixed-use commercial property; demolition began on September 14, 2006. Demolition crews destroyed the Will Rogers Elementary School, an adjacent school at 3101 Weslayan that closed in spring 2006. The former HISD {{administration building}} appears in the film The Thief Who Came to Dinner.|$|E
2500|$|Burnsville is a fully {{developed}} suburban bedroom community. Large pockets of ramblers and <b>split-level</b> houses {{were due to}} Interstate 35W's completion in the 1960s which came earlier {{than most of the}} metro highways. Burnsville through the 1990s filled in the last of its available land with upscale housing stock and apartment complexes. In the 2000s Burnsville went under redevelopment activity, producing many four-story residential buildings. The [...] "Heart of the City", a new downtown area, contains mixed-use residential and retail buildings. This has produced a diverse range of housing types from single-family homes to high-density condominiums. Since the city was developed in a sprawl fashion, new and old buildings sit between each other. The original industrial area along the Minnesota River is mostly abandoned, and also contains a sealed land-fill site. The new industrial area in {{the west side of the}} city contains many manufacturing and corporate headquarters as well as large modern warehouses. West of the new downtown area are new office buildings, where one tower reaches above ten stories.|$|E
