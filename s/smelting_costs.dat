5000|$|... 2007: By now {{the value}} of copper in the pre-1992 1p and 2p coins (which are 97% copper) {{exceeded}} those coins' face value {{to such an extent}} that melting down the coins by entrepreneurs was becoming worthwhile (with a premium of up to 11%, with <b>smelting</b> <b>costs</b> reducing this to around 4%)â€”although this is illegal, and the market value of copper has subsequently fallen dramatically from these earlier peaks.|$|E
50|$|The {{isolation}} of the mine again made the operation marginal. All supplies had to come either 462 km overland from Townsville or via Cairns for 192 km along the Chillagoe line to Almaden, and then carted by bullock team another 190 km to the mine. Coke, which was vital for <b>smelting</b> <b>cost</b> from 12 to 14 pounds to land at the mine and limestone had to be carted for over 48 km. After treating 860 tons of ore, smelting was abandoned even though 191 tons of copper matte had been produced.|$|R
50|$|At {{the current}} time, {{it is more}} {{economical}} to smelt copper ore rather than to use bioleaching, since the concentration of copper in its ore is in general quite high. The profit obtained from the speed and yield of <b>smelting</b> justifies its <b>cost.</b> Nonetheless, at the largest copper mine of the world, Escondida in Chile the process seems to be favorable.|$|R
