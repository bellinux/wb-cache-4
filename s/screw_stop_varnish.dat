5000|$|On 5 June, Whale sighted the masts of a {{seaplane}} tender, and tracked {{and closed}} the target. The submarine launched four torpedoes, scoring three hits. The target's <b>screws</b> <b>stopped</b> instantly, and powerful, rumbling explosions came from the target. However, the tender must have managed to limp to port since postwar study of Japanese records did not confirm a kill.

5000|$|Following a month {{there for}} refit and training, Threadfin {{embarked}} upon her second war patrol on 14 March. She initially joined a coordinated attack group composed of herself, and submarines [...] and [...] During her five-day tour with that wolf pack, Threadfin made two attacks on enemy shipping. On {{the afternoon of}} 28 March, she came across two Japanese destroyer escort-type warships and apparently dispatched one with a single hit from a spread of six torpedoes. The stricken warship's <b>screws</b> <b>stopped</b> while her colleague's depth charge attack deprived Threadfin of definite knowledge of the ultimate result. That evening, the submarine tangled with a convoy composed of two small trawlers and four luggers. During the ensuing surface gun engagement, the submarine inflicted serious damage {{on two of the}} luggers, moderate damage on the trawlers, and minor damage on the remaining pair of luggers. Though disconcerting, the Japanese return fire proved ineffectual.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1942 Daimler {{had also been}} working on an {{upgraded}} D-series engine that could run on either C2 or C3 fuel. The first of these, which appeared in late 1944, were a small series of DB 605DM, followed by the main production series, the DB 605DB/DC. These engines were fitted with an adjustable <b>screw</b> <b>stop</b> which allowed the use of either B4 fuel with MW-50, or C-3 fuel without MW-50, {{in which case the}} engine was designated DB 605DB, or the use of C-3 fuel with MW-50, in which case the engine was given the -DC suffix instead. In its DB-suffix form the engine generated 1,800 PS (1,775 hp) for take-off at 1.8 ata, while the DC was capable of 2,000 PS (1,973 hp) at 1.98 ata. If MW-50 was not available for use with the B4 fuel the throttle was limited to 1.45 ata for the entire flight. Thus, this series was ideally suited to catering for the chaotic fuel supply situation prevalent during the last months of the Third Reich. These engines were mainly used in the Bf 109G-10 and K-4 series.|$|R

No explosion was heard by the control party. The S-boat went to periscope depth. Smoke was pouring skyward from the enemy's conning tower. A photograph was taken of the scene as the damaged target headed for the nearest beach. At 17:36, however, the enemy disappeared from view. Sound reported that the enemy's <b>screws</b> had <b>stopped.</b>|$|R

5000|$|He {{was known}} for both his figurative and largely {{abstract}} paintings, [...] "rich in imagery, poetry and colour, which are drawn from his environment, the industrial valley towns and mountains." [...] His works often incorporate everyday materials such as sandpaper, primer, and Polyfilla, as well as conventional paint. The critic Sarah Bradford wrote of his work in 1999: [...] "He is very matter-of-fact about procedure and materials. To him painting is a very practical thing. The making is important. He brings the work to life by explaining how he manages to balance method and aesthetics. He tells of the ordinary everyday materials he uses, red oxide, polyfilla, <b>stopping</b> out <b>varnish,</b> grate blacking, and how he builds the work in layers, rubbing and scraping back, burnishing, scratching and scoring to reveal what has gone before. He rarely talks about the pictorial language which has become identifiably his and his alone, the pathways and ladders, the shapes that resemble rows of terraced houses, the scarring of the landscape, the triangle and the cross that is the piece of land {{at the end of}} the road where the war memorial stands. This is his private language. He hesitates from imposing his meaning on anyone else, preferring others to come to his work in their own way and on their terms".|$|R
50|$|By {{pushing the}} hand lever of a manual turret forward, the tool is moved via the turret's slide toward the {{workpiece}} {{being held by}} the chuck, soon making contact and cutting or forming the part. On the return stroke, the tool is retracted and then indexed to the next tool held in the turret. In this way, a sequence of operations can be performed on a part without switching tools with each operation. That is, different tools can be shifted into position without the need to unscrew one and screw in another. Each tool can be set for a different length of travel by a <b>stop</b> <b>screw</b> located at the far right of the turret.|$|R
50|$|That night, Tautog {{was headed}} for Alors Strait when she sighted a ship (thought to be a freighter) coming west, {{accompanied}} by an escort. The targets suddenly turned toward Tautog and were recognized as an antisubmarine warfare team. The submarine went deep but still received a severe pounding. On 5 January 1943, Tautog sighted a sail off her port bow and promptly closed the ship. It {{turned out to be}} a native craft with a dozen Muslim sailors, four women, several babies, some chickens, and a goat on board. After he had examined the ships papers, Tautogs commanding officer allowed the vessel to resume its voyage. On 9 January at 08:38, Tautog (relying on ULTRA) sighted a Natori-class cruiser off Ambon Island, at a range of about 3000 yd. Three minutes later, the submarine fired her first torpedo. At 09:43, her crew heard a loud explosion, and sonar reported the cruisers <b>screws</b> had <b>stopped.</b> In the next few minutes, as the cruiser got underway at reduced speed, Tautog scored two more hits, while the cruiser opened fire on her periscope with 5 in guns, preventing her from tracking the target for another attack; the cruiser limped into Ambon.|$|R
40|$|Mobile polyethilenic beating was {{introduced}} in the design of knee prostheses in the early 80 s with the aim to join motion, surface congruity and low contact stress. Based on the successful results achieved after over 20 years experience, mobile bearing knee prostheses are now widely used all over the world. Genesis® Mobile Bearing Knee is characterized by a flat and polished tibial plateau (CoCr alloy) with an anterior plug working as a stop for a poly bearing able to multidirectional motion. Additionally, the bearing motion can be restricted by using a <b>screw</b> <b>stopping</b> translation: in this condition the bearing becomes able of rotation only. The aim of this paper was to assess short-term results of a group of mobile knee prostheses obtained with conventional technique and mini-invasive technique. Methods. At the Orthopaedic Department of Genoa University from October 2003 to June 2004 we implanted 51 Genesis® Mobile Bearing knee prostheses in 51 patients (mean age 67. 8 years), because of arthritis in all the cases. In 30 patients we performed a less invasive surgical approach (midvastus) with respect of the quadriceps tendon and without patella dislocation (9 cases: conventional incision and set of instruments: 21 cases: short medial incision - 7 / 10 cm - and dedicated set of instruments). Results. The midvastus approach have improved patellar tracking: only 3 / 30 patients (1 %) need lateral release. All the 51 patients have been evaluated with a follow up ranging from 19 months to 11 months, with the aim to evaluate the clinical impact of both mobile bearing and less invasive surgical approach. Clinical results (Knee Society Score System) can be resumed as follows: excellent in 26 cases (51 %), good in 16 cases (31 %), fair in 6 cases (12 %) and bad in 3 cases (6 %). All the patients, especially those in which a less invasive approach had been used, have shown a faster recovery and a wider range of motion, reasonably related to the above mentioned improved patellar tracking. One patient has shown a limited range of motion and 3 patients have complained about spread mild pain and swelling: however, these results are scantily significant because of the too short follow up. Two patients, in which the bearing motion was restricted by the screw, have complained about postero-lateral pain during flexion, due to impingement with the popliteus tendon: this could be a real problem, caused by either the shape of the bearing (too high posterior edge) and the restricted translation. Conclusion. Even if in our experience there is a very short follow-up, the results obtained have been encouraging at least at very short term as to a rapid recovery and a wider range of motion; however, it should be underlined that these results become overlapping at middle-term...|$|R
50|$|With a 4 in/50 gun {{in place}} of her 3 in/50 gun, Scorpion set out on her second war patrol on 29 May. On 2 June, she refueled at Midway, and on 21 June she arrived off Takara Jima in the Tokara Gunto. For the next week, she searched for targets in that {{archipelago}} {{in an effort to}} disrupt shipping on the Formosa-Nagasaki routes. On 28 June, she shifted her hunt to the Yellow Sea and, by 30 June, was off the Shantung Peninsula. On 3 July, she sighted a five-freighter convoy with one escort making its way through the eastern waters of that sea. By 09:55, she had sent torpedoes toward the convoy and dived. As the depth charging began, she struck bottom at 150 ft. Two charges exploded close by. Between 10:02 and 10:06, five more shook her hull. Fearing that she was stirring up a mud trail, her <b>screws</b> were <b>stopped</b> and she settled on the bottom at 174 ft. At 10:08, a chain or cable was dragged over her hull. Four minutes later, her hull was scraped a second time. Immediately underway again, she began evasive course changes and escaped further exploding charges. The hunt continued for over an hour; and at 11:49, Scorpion came to periscope depth; spied the destroyer 7000 yd off; and cleared the area. Postwar examination of Japanese records show that Scorpion scored five hits, and sank a 3890 LT freighter - the Anzan Maru - and a 6112 LT passenger-cargo ship - the Kokuryu Maru.|$|R

Licensed under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] analysis of bone is an innovative technique that uses sequential image data to analyze bone mechanics under a given loading regime. This paper presents {{the development of a}} novel device capable of performing step-wise screw insertion into excised bone specimens, within the microCT environment, whilst simultaneously recording insertion torque, compression under the screw head and rotation angle. The system is computer controlled and screw insertion is performed in incremental steps of insertion torque. A series of screw insertion tests to failure were performed (n= 21) to establish a relationship between the torque at head contact and stripping torque (R 2 = 0. 89). The test-device was then used to perform step-wise <b>screw</b> insertion, <b>stopping</b> at intervals of 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % between screw head contact and screw stripping. Image data-sets were acquired at each of these time-points as well as at head contact and post-failure. Examination of the image data revealed the trabecular deformation as a result of increased insertion torque was restricted to within 1 mm of the outer diameter of the screw thread. Minimal deformation occurred prior to the step between the 80 % time-point and post-failure. The device presented has allowed, for the first time, visualization of the micro-mechanical response in the peri-implant bone with increased tightening torque. Further testing on more samples is expected to increase our understanding of the effects of increased tightening torque at the micro-structural level, and the failure mechanisms of trabeculae...|$|R
5000|$|As post-script to the vz. 24 story, the {{production}} of the Czech Kar 98k Mauser continued {{after the end of the}} war. Under Czechoslovak Army designation vz. 98N (vz. being an abbreviation for vzor, or model year, and the suffix '"N"' denoted německá - the word '"German"' in Czech (language), this designation being used on many weapons of German origin kept in the post-World War II Czechoslovak armed forces), it served until around 1952 as the service rifle for the post-war Czechoslovak forces, and was extensively exported. Early post-war specimens were identical with wartime versions, and the use of existing stocks of wartime parts continued until exhausted. The receiver marking reverted to a pre-war style Czech rampant lion symbol, although a specimen using a German style receiver code of 'tgf' and the date '1950' has been observed. The left side of the receiver was marked [...] "ČESKOSLOVENSKÁ ZBROJOVKA, A.S., BRNO". The standard settled on was distinguished by a new magazine assembly made from steel stampings, with an oversized trigger guard for use with thick winter gloves. The new stamping, unlike late-war German stamped trigger guard/magazine assemblies, did not have a detachable magazine floorplate, meaning whole trigger guard/magazine must be unscrewed and removed entirely to clean the magazine. The locking <b>screws,</b> which <b>stopped</b> movement of the bolts securing the action and trigger guard to the stock, were deleted. Stocks were mostly solid (not laminated) beech with the German Kar 98k side sling attachments but no cleaning rod recess, and a German [...] "Kriegsmodell" [...] type late-war buttplate with firing pin dismantling hole in the side. Examples produced after the Communist takeover in 1948 were marked Národní podnik ("National Corporation").|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The Harms {{technique}} {{is now considered}} as the gold standard to stabilize C 1 -C 2 cervical spine. It {{has been reported to}} decrease the risk of vertebral artery injury. However, the risk of vascular injury does not totally disappear, particularly due to the proximity of the trans-isthmic C 2 screw with the foramen transversarium of C 2. In order to decrease this risk of vertebral artery injury, it has been proposed to use a shorter <b>screw</b> which <b>stops</b> before the foramen transversarium. OBJECT: The main objective was to compare the pull-out strength of long trans-isthmic screw (LS) versus short isthmic screw (SS) C 2 screw. An additional morphological study was also performed. METHOD: Thirteen fresh-frozen human cadaveric cervical spines were included in the study. Orientation, width and height of the isthmus of C 2 were measured on CT scan. Then, 3. 5 -mm titanium screws were inserted in C 2 isthmus according to the Harms technique. Each specimen received a LS and a SS. The side and the order of placement were determined with a randomization table. Pull-out strengths and stiffness were evaluated with a testing machine, and paired samples were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and also the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The mean isthmus transversal orientation was 20 ° ± 6 °. The mean width of C 2 isthmus was less than 3. 5 mm in 35 % of the cases. The mean pull-out strength for LS was 340 ± 85 versus 213 ± 104 N for SS (p = 0. 004). The mean stiffness for the LS was 144 ± 40 and 97 ± 54 N/mm for the SS (p = 0. 02). DISCUSSION: The pull-out strength of trans-isthmic C 2 screws was significantly higher (60 % additional pull-out resistance) than SSs. Although associated with an inferior resistance, SSs may be used in case of narrow isthmus which contraindicates 3. 5 -mm screw insertion but does not represent the first option for C 2 instrumentation.

5000|$|Detaching [...] {{to proceed}} to her {{assigned}} patrol area and [...] to hers, Lagarto proceeded {{to carry out the}} remainder of her patrol. Outside aircraft sightings on 17, 19 February and 20 February, it seemed devoid of contacts until the forenoon watch on 24 February 1945 off Okino Shima. Identifying a “RO-class submarine” at 10:58, Lagarto maneuvered into position and launched four torpedoes at 11:18; she logged the sound of what appeared to be an explosion on the target, and a second explosion that seemed to reflect the impact of the torpedo with an underwater cliff. Her quarry got off a report: “Torpedo attack in position 32-41N., 132-36E. Damage sustained...” The target’s <b>screws</b> appeared to <b>stop</b> shortly after the explosion, followed less than ten minutes later by a “heavy underwater explosion like a collapsed hull...” The identity of Lagarto’s victim appears to have been the Japanese submarine I-371 (Lieutenant Kamijukoku Yasuo), that had departed Truk for Yokosuka on 31 January 1945. However, the credit of the 880-ton merchantman Tatsumomo Maru to Lagarto seems questionable in view of Lagarto’s only carrying out one attack on one target, reported as a submarine, in excellent visibility conditions. Sweeping the area with her periscope soon thereafter, Lagarto saw only empty ocean. Later that day, she heard “distant, heavy depth charge explosions,” prompting Latta to write: “Hope Haddock is not paying for our attack...” ...|$|R
5000|$|In [...] Extrusion Blow Molding (EBM), plastic {{is melted}} and {{extruded}} {{into a hollow}} tube (a parison). This parison is then captured by closing it into a cooled metal mold. Air is then blown into the parison, inflating it {{into the shape of}} the hollow bottle, container, or part. After the plastic has cooled sufficiently, the mold is opened and the part is ejected. [...] Continuous and Intermittent are two variations of Extrusion Blow Molding. In Continuous Extrusion Blow Molding the parison is extruded continuously and the individual parts are cut off by a suitable knife. In Intermittent blow molding there are two processes: straight intermittent is similar to injection molding whereby the <b>screw</b> turns, then <b>stops</b> and pushes the melt out. With the accumulator method, an accumulator gathers melted plastic and when the previous mold has cooled and enough plastic has accumulated, a rod pushes the melted plastic and forms the parison. In this case the screw may turn continuously or intermittently. With continuous extrusion the weight of the parison drags the parison and makes calibrating the wall thickness difficult. The accumulator head or reciprocating screw methods use hydraulic systems to push the parison out quickly reducing the effect of the weight and allowing precise control over the wall thickness by adjusting the die gap with a parison programming device.|$|R
