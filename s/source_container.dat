For example, in Su Song's clock, water flowed into a container on a pivot. The escapement's role was to tip the container over each time it filled up, thus advancing the clock's wheels each time an equal quantity of water was measured out. The time between releases depended on the rate of flow, which decreased with water pressure {{as the level of}} water in the <b>source</b> <b>container</b> dropped. The development of mechanical clocks depended on the invention of an escapement which would allow a clock's movement to be controlled by an oscillating weight. Unlike the continuous flow of water in the Chinese device, the medieval escapement was characterized by a regular, repeating sequence of discrete actions and the capability of self-reversing action: ...|$|E

30|$|However, {{we assume}} that the Cherenkov {{radiation}} is mainly produced inside the <b>source</b> <b>container</b> by the different types of particles described, since Cherenkov radiation production outside of the source volume results from a chain of processes (high-energy photons that release photoelectrons or Compton electrons with energy above the Cherenkov threshold) that makes the Cherenkov emission less likely (it should be noted that this secondary radiation has been successfully used, for example for high time resolution Cherenkov TOFPET systems [31], even if in different experimental conditions that favor this chain of processes). As far as the attenuation, the <b>source</b> <b>container</b> attenuates the Cherenkov radiation (Plexiglas transmits approximately 90 % of the visible light), and the container/air interface causes an additional loss of light due to reflection and refraction. The addition of a layer of tissue with no optical coupling results in two additional interfaces that refract and reflect the light produced in the <b>source</b> <b>container.</b> A maximum penetration depth of 1.9 cm for visible light in chicken breast was measured in [32]. From this measured value, we can expect roughly a 42 % reduction of the light intensity over 8 mm, which is in good agreement with our measured 40 % reduction.|$|E

Generally, an electrospinning set-up consists of a high voltage <b>source,</b> <b>container</b> (usually syringe) for polymer solution, syringe pump, capillary nozzle, and grounded collector (Pham et al. 2006). When high electric voltage is applied, the surface tension of polymer solution is overcome by the applied electric field.

Meanwhile, solvent from the polymer jet continuously evaporates and solidifies to form fiber webs on a collector (Reneker and Chun 1996).|$|E

Many bottlenecks exist {{in the process of}} a clinical investigator using shared data including data acquisition and statistical analysis. The objective of this project is to develop a structure for sharing data and providing rapid automated statistical analysis through creation of a pre-packaged, open-source software container. Methods: We use the open <b>source</b> software <b>container</b> technologies VirtualBox and Vagrant to create a template for sharing clinical data and analysis scripts as a single container. We use a timer to record the time necessary to setup and initialize the software container and view the results. Results: We have created a template for sharing data and analysis scripts together using open <b>source</b> software <b>container</b> technologies VirtualBox and Vagrant. We found the time needed to initialize the container to be 5 minutes and 36 seconds for a macOS-based machine and 7 minutes and 2 seconds for a Windows-based machine. Containers can be downloaded and executed from any Mac or Windows computer allowing both the reuse of and interaction with the data. This greatly reduces the time and effort needed to obtain and analyze clinical data. Conclusion: Reducing the time and effort needed to obtain and analyze clinical data increases the time available for data exploration and the discovery of new knowledge.

SNAP 3 generator 3 M- 1 G 10 completed 322 days of life test operation, and the power input was terminated after the generator was operated under a full range of external loads to obtain performance characteristics. Electrical power output after 322 days at steady-state heat source and external load conditions was 1. 92 watts, for an over-all efficiency of 2. 9 %. Tear-down inspection of the generator conformed previous indications of incrsased internal electrical resistance and thermal conductivity, which account for the gradual reduction in generator performance from the start-of-life electrical output of 3. 45 watts and 5. 2 % over-all efficiency.

Sediment oxidation state, sediment <b>source,</b> <b>container</b> type, flow regime, and light transmittance were tested to improve nursery pond cultivation techniques and to test assumptions about the decline of seagrasses in Galveston Bay, Texas. Oxidized and reduced sediments exhibited no statistical difference as mean percent change {{in the number of}} stems of shoal-grass, after 47 days. Sediment from three source locations, West Bay, East Beach Lagoons, and the experimental pond bottoms, showed {{no significant difference in the}} mean percent change in the number of stems of shoal-grass at 48 and 95 days. A statistical difference was seen in the container type experiment, trays versus pots, at 48 days where shoal-grass had double the number of stems produced in trays; however no significant difference was found at 93 days. A significant difference was found in the flow regime experiment, no-flow versus flow, at 47 days in the mean percent change of shoal-grass with double the number of stems produced in the flow regime. Significant differences were observed between the low light and high light treatments with shoal-grass, widgeongrass (Ruppia maritima), star grass (Halophila engelmannii), and turtlegrass (Thalassia testudinum), with survival and growth occurring in the high light treatment and decline and death occurring in the low light treatment. The importance of reduced sediment may have been overstated in the past as sediment reduction occurs rapidly with submersion. It appears that while West Bay sediment did not have a deleterious effect on shoal-grass, West Bay simulated light conditions did.

40|$|At the moment, cloud {{containers}} are a {{hot topic}} in the IT world in general, and security in particular. The world's top technology companies, including Microsoft, Google and Facebook, all use them. Although it's still early days, containers are seeing increasing use in production environments. Containers promise a streamlined, easy-to-deploy and secure method of implementing specific infrastructure requirements, and they also offer an alternative to virtual machines. The key thing to recognize with cloud containers {{is that they are}} designed to virtualize a single application [...] e. g., you have a MySQL container and that's all it does, provide a virtual instance of that application. Containers create an isolation boundary at the application level rather than at the server level. This isolation means that if anything goes wrong in that single container (e. g., excessive consumption of resources by a process) it only affects that individual container and not the whole VM or whole server. It also stops compatibility problems between applications that reside on the same operating system (OS). But despite their success, containers still present challenges. Container scalability, for example, remains somewhat of a mystery. Some organizations struggle when trying to scale Docker, one of the leading container technologies. There are couple of Open <b>Source</b> <b>container</b> cluster management tool. Each cluster management technology has something unique and different to offer. Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are probably two most commonly used tools to deploy containers inside a cluster. Both are created as helper tools {{that can be used to}} manage a cluster of containers and treat all servers as a single unit. When trying to make a choice between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, think in following terms. Do you want to depend on Docker itself solving problems related to clustering. If you do, choose Swarm. If something is not supported by Docker it will be unlikely that it will be supported by Swarm since it relies on Docker API. On the other hand, if you want a tool that works around Docker limitations, Kubernetes might be the right one for you. Kubernetes was not built around Docker but is based on Google’s experience with containers. It is opinionated and tries to do things in its own wa...|$|E
