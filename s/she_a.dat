They sought refuge in Strassbourg, a stronghold of Calvinism. Gebhard {{had been a member of}} the Cathedral Chapter there since 1576. Three other canons from Cologne had also taken refuge in Strassbourg after 1583. Shortly after their {{marriage}} in 1583, Gebhard had written his Testament in which he left his estate to his brother, Karl, and a life-time annuity to Agnes, and charged Karl with her safety and protection. Karl died on 18June 1593, and was buried in the Strasbourg cathedral; Gebhard wrote a codicil leaving Agnes to the care and protection of the Dukes of Württemberg. Gebhard died on 21 May 1601. Until her death in 1637, she lived under the protection of the Dukes, first Friedrich I, later Johann Friedrich and then his son Eberhard. She was buried in Sulzbach.|$|E

5|$|Shirley Williams's {{political}} career (the House of Commons regularly sat until 10 pm) {{meant that the}} couple {{spent a lot of}} time apart. They bought a house in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, near the border with north Cambridgeshire, while she lived in Phillimore Place during the week to be close to the Houses of Parliament. Sunday was often the only day they were together. The differences in their personal values– he was an atheist, <b>she</b> <b>a</b> Catholic– placed a further strain on their relationship. It reached breaking point in 1970 when Williams formed a relationship with Patricia Law Skinner, a commissioning editor for Cambridge University Press and wife of the historian Quentin Skinner. She had approached Williams to write the opposing view of utilitarianism for Utilitarianism: For and Against with J. J. C. Smart (1973), and they had fallen in love.|$|E

5|$|Sweet Tooth {{is a love}} story, a spy novel, and a {{book about}} {{literature}} itself. Serena and her boyfriend Haley– <b>she</b> <b>a</b> well-read but uncritical lover of literature, he a highly accomplished writer and literary scholar– have different attitudes towards literature. Serena prefers a realist approach, where life in the book reflects real life. Haley {{on the other hand}} is of a more modernist school, and enjoys experimentation in his work. McEwan plays with these differences, firstly by placing himself in the novel and blurring the line between author and character, and secondly by writing {{what appears to be a}} straight first-person narrative, only to distort this perception at the very end.|$|E

500|$|Lisa, {{despite being}} a child prodigy, often sees {{herself as a}} misfit within the Simpson family and other {{children}} due to her extremely high level of intelligence. She shows characteristics rarely seen in Springfield, including spirituality and commitment to peaceful ways, and is notably more concerned with world affairs than her life in Springfield, with her rebellion against social norms being depicted as constructive and heroic, yet she can be self-righteous at times. In [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", an increasing sense of moral righteousness leads her to disrupt her father's roast-pig barbecue, an act for which she later apologizes. Episodes often take shots at Lisa's idealism and virtue signalling. In [...] "Bart Star", (season nine, 1997) Lisa, departs from her typically more genuine nature and apparently {{looking for a new}} cause to crusade over, defiantly declares that <b>she,</b> <b>a</b> girl, would like to join the football team. In the 1990s, it was considered odd to allow a girl to play football. However, when coach Ned Flanders reveals that several girls already play for the team, she hesitates and claims football is [...] "not really [...] thing". She then expresses distaste about a ball made of pig's skin, but one of the girls informs her that their footballs are synthetic and that proceeds are donated to Amnesty International. Upset by being unable to gain moral superiority, Lisa runs off.|$|E
500|$|She {{is one of}} the {{foundational}} works of fantasy literature, coming around the time of The Princess and the Goblin (1858) by George MacDonald, William Morris' The Wood Beyond the World and The Well at the World's End, and the short stories of Lord Dunsany. It is marked by a strong element of [...] "the marvelous" [...] in the figure of Ayesha, a two-thousand-year-old sorceress, and the 'Spirit of the World', an undying fire that confers immortality. Indeed, Haggard's story {{is one of the}} first in modern literature to feature [...] "a slight intrusion of something unreal" [...] into a very real world – a hallmark of the fantasy genre. Similarly, the carefully constructed [...] "fantasy history" [...] of She foreshadows the use of this technique that characterises later fantasies such as The Lord of the Rings and The Wheel of Time series, and which imparts a [...] "degree of security" [...] to the secondary world. However, the story of She is firmly ensconced in what fantasy theorists call 'primary world reality', with the lost kingdom of Kôr, the realm ruled by the supernatural <b>She,</b> <b>a</b> fantastic [...] "Tertiary World" [...] at once directly part of and at the same time indirectly set apart from normative [...] "primary" [...] reality. Along with Haggard's prior novel, King Solomon's Mines, She laid the blueprints for the [...] "Lost World" [...] subgenre in fantasy literature, as well as the convention of the [...] "lost race". As Brantlinger has noted of the novel's importance to the development of the [...] "secondary world" [...] in fantasy literature: [...] "Haggard may seem peripheral to the development of science fiction, and yet his African quest romances could easily be transposed to other planets and galaxies". In his history of science fiction, Billion Year Spree, Brian Aldiss notes the frequency with which Ayesha's death in the Pillar of Fire has been imitated by later science fiction and fantasy writers: [...] "From Haggard on, crumbling women, priestesses, or empresses – all symbols of women as Untouchable and Unmakeable – fill the pages of many a scientific romance".|$|E
