50|$|In {{order for}} pyocyanin to be {{synthesized}} by P. aeruginosa, two specific genes must be functional. MvfR is a gene which produces a transcription factor which activates phnAB genes. These genes produce the molecule quinolone which then regulates operons 1 and 2 of phzRABCDEFG which {{are key to}} the synthesis of phenazine. The synthesis of pyocyanin is primarily controlled by the quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>process.</b> P.aeruginosa strains which are unable to synthesise PCN can still benefit from its effects if the strain has co- infected the lung with wild type strains which can produce pyocyanin. Biosynthesis can be impaired by disrupting the aro pathway {{which is responsible for}} the synthesis of chorismic acid from shikimate. Chorismic acid is the precursor of pyocyanin.|$|E
50|$|The quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>process</b> {{in honey}} bees {{is similar to}} the method used by Temnothorax ants in several ways. A small portion of the workers leave the swarm to search out new nest sites, and each worker assesses the quality of the cavity it finds. The worker then returns to the swarm and {{recruits}} other workers to her cavity using the honey bee waggle dance. However, instead of using a time delay, the number of dance repetitions the worker performs is dependent {{on the quality of the}} site. Workers that found poor nests stop dancing sooner, and can therefore be recruited to the better sites. Once the visitors to a new site sense that a quorum number (usually 10-20 bees) has been reached, they return to the swarm and begin using a new recruitment method called piping. This vibration signal causes the swarm to take off and fly to the new nest location. In an experimental test, this decision-making process enabled honey bee swarms to choose the best nest site in four out of five trials.|$|E

However, the frequency span may be programmed to the full DVB-T range (470 to 790 MHz) if the sensor network is to be tested with real wireless microphone systems, located in the clusters area.

Once made biocompatible, contrast imaging (differential interference contrast, phase contrast) and high-resolution fluorescence imaging of subcellular structures can be implemented through the textured surface using an inverted microscope.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{condition for}} the legal approval of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) approaches is {{the protection of the}} Primary User (PU). However, for DSA to become an attractive service reality, it is crucial to ensure also some Quality of Service (QoS) support for the Secondary User (SU) communication. In this paper, we discuss sensing based opportunistic spectrum access approaches, in which PU protection is achieved by a properly organized <b>sensing</b> <b>process</b> and SU communication reconfiguration. While the required reliability of the <b>sensing</b> <b>process</b> can be expressed in terms of rarely enough overlooking the PU, we assume that the proper QoS for the SU is given by maintaining — with a given confidence level — a minimum bandwidth availability for the SU in spite of PU dynamics. In this paper we present an overview of approaches which might be used to achieve these objectives. In addition we point out, that both the <b>sensing</b> <b>process</b> and the secondary link maintenance (necessary to keep the required bandwidth in spite of reconfiguration due to detected PUs) require a significant spectrum overhead. We identify and elaborate a fundamental tradeoff in using these overheads in either sensing or link maintenance, and present examples of its optimization...|$|E
