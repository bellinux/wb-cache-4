40|$|Prior studies {{argue that}} <b>stable</b> <b>shareholders</b> do not {{encourage}} firm managers {{to manage their}} earnings to achieve short-term earnings goals. They also state that firm managers with <b>stable</b> <b>shareholders</b> {{have an incentive to}} report smooth earnings to maintain long-term relationships with such shareholders. We focus on cross-shareholdings and stable shareholdings owned by financial institutions as stable shareholdings in Japan, and investigate the effect of these ownership structures on earnings management patterns. Specifically, we hypothesize that stable shareholdings are positively associated with the informational components of earnings smoothing, and negatively associated with big bath. Consistent with our hypotheses, we first find that as stable shareholdings increase, managers are more likely to conduct earnings smoothing that provides useful information to <b>stable</b> <b>shareholders.</b> Second, we reveal that managers are less likely to engage in big bath behavior as stable shareholdings increase. Finally, our additional analysis shows that stable shareholdings reduce incentives for managers to cut discretionary expenditures to meet short-term earnings benchmarks, implying that stable shareholdings could reduce the possibility of a myopic problem. These results suggest that managers with stable shareholdings tend to report smoother and less volatile earnings, and do not tend to pursue earnings management to attain short-term earnings targets.

40|$|This study investigates {{whether a}} series of recent {{economic}} reforms on corporate governance influence the operational performance of Japanese manufacturing industries after the bubble economy. This study finds that stable shareholding is {{an important aspect of}} traditional Japanese corporate governance. Many Japanese corporate leaders still believe that the <b>stable</b> <b>shareholders</b> are important for their governance. However, the stable shareholding enhances their operational performance only when the ratio of shares held by <b>stable</b> <b>shareholders</b> is more than 61. 21 %. This result is inconsistent with the previous governance strategy of Japanese management. Moreover, the foreign investment enhances the operational performance of Japanese firms until the ratio of shares held by foreign shareholders becomes 19. 49 %. Japanese corporate leaders are very afraid of the foreign investment. This result is inconsistent with their opinions, as well. The second result indicates that Japanese firms need to accept more foreign investment and pay attention to the opinion of foreign investors. Finally, it is important for Japanese firms to make a balance between the traditional stable shareholding and the foreign investment. Corporate governance Japanese manufacturing DEA...|$|E
40|$|The Japanese {{employment}} system {{has often been}} characterized as one that favors long-term, stable employment. It is said that institutional complementarity has existed between this system and the Japanese relational fi nancial system, in which the fi nancial transactions mainly comprise loans by banks.

This study analyzes the effects of foreign shareholders on the number of employees in listed Japanese fi rms from 1997 to 2007.

40|$|In Japan, the {{percentage}} of shareholders has increased while dividend rate has decrease. In previous years, the dividend rate {{is said to be}} lower in Japan than in USA or Europe. Dividend rates in Japanese firms could have increased as far as foreign shareholders have increased since most of them are thought to be institutional investors with market orientated commitment. In this paper I use data of manufacturing firms listed by the stock market since 1985 to 2009 splinted in two periods since character of corporate governance is thought to have changed since the second 1985. According to the analysis conclusions are summarized as follows: Foreign shareholders have consistently increased dividend rates since 1985. Moreover, there is no significant relationship between {{the percentage}} of financial institutions and dividend rates in the period 1985 - 1996. However, a reverse trend emerged from the second half of 1990 s reflecting that {{the percentage of}} trust banks has increased and the commitment of financial institutions has change toward market approach.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to explain the {{transformation}} of Japanese corporate law {{in the last three}} decades. The data is collected in the field study in Japan between May 2005 and June 2006. This project shows that the chaning dominant policy paradigm that defines the nature of a corporation and its relationship with the society in the policy field has indispensable impact on corporate legislation. Before the mid 1990 s Japanese corporate legislation was dominated by bureaucrats in Ministry of Justice and the community of law scholars; they saw a corporation as a special association that has profound impacts on social order. The economic crisis in 1990 and the diffusion of the U. S. economic thinking among young generation of economic bureaucrats led to the regime shift of corporate legislation. After 1997, corporate legislation was dominated by economic bureaucrats who saw a corporation as a nexus of contracts whose only relationship with society is producing wealth. This shift significantly changed the course of corporate legislation. First, the paradigm shift brought different regulatory schemes for corporate finance. Before the mid 1997, corporate finance was seen as a source of turbulence and was strongly restrained. After the paradigm shift in 1997, corporate finance was perceived as a positive way to raise shareholder value by economic bureaucrats. Therefore, the course of legislation shifted to substantial deregulation. Second, the paradigm shift also brought significant change to the regulations for governance structure. Before 1997, a corporation was seen as an association composed of <b>stable</b> <b>shareholders.</b> Therefore, the solution to managerial misconducts was to strengthen internal democracy. After 1997 because the perception of a corporation had shifted to a nexus of contracts that are constantly negotiated in financial markets, the solutions to managerial misconducts were to strengthen board independence and information disclosure. Third, before 1997 corporate restructuring was seen as an important event that entails complicated procedural requirements to protect shareholders and creditors. After 1997 because corporate restructuring was treated as a tool to enhance economic efficiency by economic bureaucrats, a variety of restructuring schemes were deregulated. Dissertatio...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze a publicly-traded firm’s {{decision}} to stay public or go private in a setting in which managerial autonomy from shareholder intervention affects the supply of productive inputs by management. With public ownership, the shareholder base of the firm is subject to stochastic shocks as market liquidity facilitates active trading. With heterogeneity among shareholders, this exposes management to uncertainty regarding the extent of shareholder intervention in future management decisions and consequently curtails managerial incentives to supply privately-costly inputs. By contrast, private ownership provides a <b>stable</b> <b>shareholder</b> base and improves these input-provision incentives. Thus, capital market liquidity has a surprising “dark side ” that discourages public ownership. This means our model takes seriously a key difference between private and public equity markets in that, unlike the private market, the degree of investor participation and the heterogeneity among shareholders are both stochastic in the public market. This allows us to draw predictions {{about the effects of}} investor participation and stock price volatility on the public firm’s incentives to go private. We thus provide a link between investor participation and firm participation in public markets...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that companies owned by private-equity sponsors have significant advantages over public companies. Among the advantages of private equity cited by commentators are: (1) better governance and a greater willingness to take risks, (2) the ability to focus on long-term issues and a more <b>stable</b> <b>shareholder</b> base, (3) the ability to attract better management talent, (4) creating a sense of urgency, (5) {{the ability to use}} leverage more effectively, (6) avoiding the costs imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (7) freedom from shareholder suits. It would be helpful if public companies could gain some of these advantages. This Article examines whether changes in existing legal rules governing how public company directors are chosen {{and the extent to which}} public company directors can be held liable for damages if they do not have a conflict of interest would be likely to increase the ability of public companies to obtain some of the benefits that companies owned by private-equity sponsors appear to have. My conclusion is that, while changing the rules for selecting directors would not be worthwhile, a reduction in the potential liability of directors for damages in situations in which they do not have a conflict of interest would be likely to increase the ability of public companies to mirror the effectiveness of private-equity portfolio companies without creating other problems that would be unacceptable...|$|R
40|$|We analyze a publicly-traded firm’s {{decision}} to stay public or go private when managerial autonomy from shareholder intervention affects the supply of productive inputs by management. We show that both the advantage and the disadvantage of public ownership relative to private ownership lie in the liquidity of public ownership. While the liquidity of public ownership lets shareholders trade easily and supply capital at a lower cost, the liquidity-engendered trading also results in stochastic shocks to a firm’s shareholder base. This exposes management to uncertainty regarding the identity of future shareholders and their extent of intervention in management decisions and in turn curtails managerial incentives. By contrast, because of its illiquidity, private ownership provides a <b>stable</b> <b>shareholder</b> base and improves these input provision incentives but results in a higher cost of capital. Thus, capital market liquidity, while being a principal advantage of public ownership, also has a surprising 'dark side' that discourages public ownership. Our model takes seriously a key difference between private and public equity markets in that, unlike the private market, the firm’s shareholder base, namely the extent of investor participation, is stochastic in the public market. This allows us to extract predictions {{about the effects of}} investor participation on the stock price level and volatility and on the public firm’s incentives to go private, thereby providing a link between investor participation and firm participation in public markets. Lesser investor participation induces lower and more volatile stock prices, encouraging public firms to go private, whereas greater investor participation encourages younger firms to go public. Moreover, IPO underpricing is optimal because it is shown to lead to a higher and less volatile post-IPO stock price, greater autonomy for the manager and a higher supply of privately-costly managerial inputs. corporate finance...|$|R

We suggest that these cross-country differences may be explained by differences in values held by people of these countries. Using the cultural dimensions identified by Geert Hofstede as indicators of these values, we identify, theoretically, the likely effects of national cultures on ownership patterns, and test these redictions empirically.

40|$|Eumedion is a Dutch {{foundation}} {{representing the}} interests of Dutch and foreign institutional investors with investments in Dutch listed companies. In particular, it represents {{the interests of}} these participants {{in the field of}} corporate governance and sustainability. The foundation was established in 2006 with the objective to maintain and develop good corporate governance and sustainability performance by listed companies and institutional investors in the Netherlands and Europe. In this report, we address the following research question: To what extent has Eumedion contributed to the development and improvement of corporate governance and sustainability in the Netherlands during the 2006 - 2015 period? We analyze Eumedion’s contribution by using a theoretical framework that describes the process of developing norms of corporate governance and sustainability. These norms describe how (good) corporate governance and sustainability should look like. The process of developing norms can be broken down in three stages, i. e. norm setting, norm spreading and norm implementation. Our analysis describes how Eumedion is actively involved in all three stages. The analysis in this report is based on a large data base consisting of documents that are publicly available from Eumedion’s website as well as documents we obtained from Eumedion’s secretariat and consists of Eumedion’s Corporate Governance Manual, policy plans (beleidsplannen), annual reports, position papers, comment letters, consultation documents, focus letters, company dialogues, company alerts, and annual evaluations of annual general meetings of shareholders (AMGs). Moreover, we collected information about the media attention for Eumedion. The data covers the period 2005 - 2016. Finally, we held interviews with fourteen important actors in the Dutch and international corporate governance field who shared their experiences with and ideas and perceptions about the activities of Eumedion. Our analysis reveals the following results. In the norm setting stage, norms regarding corporate governance and sustainability are established. Eumedion has been actively involved in this process, first of all by writing consultation reactions and sending comment letters to Dutch and European institutions directly involved in setting norms. In particular, it is frequently communicating with the Dutch Ministry of Finance, the European Union Institutions and (committees of) the Dutch House of Representatives, because they are most important in setting corporate governance and sustainability norms. The analysis also shows that Eumedion is discussing a wide range of corporate governance and sustainability topics in its interactions with these institutions. Yet, over time the emphasis of topics discussed shifted from more traditional corporate governance topics (such as shareholder rights and remuneration) to financial and non-financial reporting {{and the role of the}} internal auditing function and external auditor. During the 2008 - 2012 it was particularly active on issues related to the financial markets and banking industry as a consequence of the global financial crisis. Finally, our analysis reveals that Eumedion has joined committees and boards of organizations that are important in establishing corporate governance and sustainaibilty norms, both in, as well as outside, the Netherlands. Next to the consultation reactions and comment letter, Eumedion produces position papers (since 2008), which are aimed at boosting discussions about norm setting and/or changes. Eumedion has been very active in writing these papers, especially during the years 2014 - 2016, signaling its active role in debates as a thought leader. The majority of these papers deal with topics related to the powers of shareholders and disclosures. Eumedion is also active in several Dutch and international committees in which norm setting regarding corporate governance and sustainability is discussed and developed. Eumedion’s network of organizations in which it participates has widened considerably over the years. During the second stage, norms are spread, or diffused, to the parties in the field who are supposed to act according to these norms. In order to make sure they act upon the norms, they should be made aware of them. Most importantly, Eumedion is active at this stage of the norm development process by annually issuing so-called focus letters, which are sent to Dutch listed companies and in which it communicates the most important topics for institutional investors for the next reporting and AGM season. Our review of these letters shows that they discuss a wide range of topics with an emphasis on the procedures regarding the organization of AGMs, content and accountability of remuneration policies, corporate risk analysis, risk management and control and reporting issues. The overview also shows that over the years the focus of the focus letters has shifted towards addressing risk and reporting issues. Evaluating the effectiveness of the focus letters suggests that they have had a significant impact on corporate governance behavior of Dutch listed companies and other related actors. The fact that Eumedion puts and keeps issues on the agenda of discussions about corporate governance between management and shareholders stimulates companies to address these issues. During its early years (2006 - 2009) Eumedion was mostly involved in norm setting and norm spreading. Since 2009, it became more and more involved in the third stage of the norm development process. During this stage, it is evaluated whether and to what extent norms are being implemented by companies. Eumedion again is actively involved in this stage. First of all, it has annual dialogues with a selection of Dutch listed companies, during which it communicates its observations and discusses its opinion on how norms should be applied by a specific company. Moreover, in case of controversial proposals made by company management at the AGM it may start the so-called alert procedure, which may lead to sending out an official alert to the company and Eumedion’s participants. In this alert, it describes why it would like to see the proposal to be withdrawn or changed. Our evaluation of the use of company dialogues and alert service suggests that they played an important role in making norm implementation by participants a coordinated activity, i. e. it helped professionalizing the norm implementation process. They also helped Eumedion becoming increasingly influential in determining the debates over governance and sustainability both within the board room as well as during AGMs. Combining the empirical evaluation of the documents with the content of the expert interviews reveals the following picture. First, although Eumedion is a small organization, it has been able to make a significant and positive contribution to all three stages of the norm development process in the Netherlands during the past ten years. It is taken into account as a serious partner in discussions during policy developments by important decision makers, management and supervisory board of companies and other relevant parties, both domestically as well as internationally. Moreover, Eumedion is seen as a serious knowledge centre and an active and respected organization representing shareholder interests. Second, Eumedion has been actively involved in discussing a broad spectrum of corporate goverance and sustainability issues, i. e. from traditional corporate governance topics, such as shareholder rights and remuneration to corporate social responsibility and tax avoidance. Third, Eumedion has helped creating an environment in which there is a permanent dialogue between company management and investors during, but certainly also outside, the AGM. It has been successful in getting and keeping important governance issues on the agenda, in establishing closer and more informative relationships between management and shareholders, and in helping to make sure that shareholders are taken more seriously. It has also stimulated institutional investors to take their role as engaged shareholders more seriously. Fourth, with respect to the implementation of norms, Eumedion may have been less effective in some cases in changing company behavior because it is a relatively small player. For some of the companies with which it has a dialogue and/or sends out an alert, Eumedion represents only a small part of outstanding shares. Moreover, companies focus more on internationally operating proxy advisors such as ISS and Glass Lewis, because foreign institutional investors mostly look at the advice given by these proxy advisors, instead of looking at the alerts issued by Eumedion. Fifth, Eumedion has a limited mandate to speak on behalf of its participants in its communication with companies. The issue of the mandate of the representative of institutional investors in the Netherlands has been on the table ever since its predecessor, the SCGOP was established; Eumedion as its successor “inherited” this discussion. It may signal controversial governance issues, yet its participants ultimately decide for themselves how they deal with these issues. Obviously, this reduces Eumedion’s direct power in influencing company behavior. Sitxh, Eumedion focuses on corporate governance and sustainability. Since in many cases corporate governance and sustainability issues are not really integrated in portfolio management and analysis of both investors and companies, the effectiveness of Eumedion in representing interests of its participants with respect to these issues is reduced. Looking at the future, we suggest Eumedion to elaborate on the following three issues. First, given its experience and knowledge in the field of corporate governance and sustainability, it can play an important role in facilitating the discussion on how to integrate CSR decisions in portfolio management decisions, both within companies and institutional investors, as well as between companies and their investors. In communications they have with both these parties, it could more forcefully stress the fact that firm value and CSR are complements rather than substitutes, at least in the long-term. Second, Eumedion could focus on stimulating, and perhaps even leading, the current debate on engaged share-ownership, both within and outside the Netherlands. Recently, Eumedion has voiced its concerns about the lack of an engaged and <b>stable</b> <b>shareholder</b> base in Dutch listed companies and the potential consequences of this for the long-term sustainability of these companies and its owners. It has also raised its voice in criticizing the use of loyalty shares as a way to create a <b>stable</b> <b>shareholder</b> base. This signals Eumedion has a clear stance in the debate on how to deal with developing an engaged and <b>stable</b> <b>shareholder</b> base. It could therefore become one of the thought leaders on this issue in the coming years. Third, the fact that it has a limited mandate to act on behalf of its participants is a weakness of the model of interest representation used in the case of Eumedion. Strengthening its position as a representative of its participants vis-à-vis company management would leverage the effectiveness of the association in the process of norm implementation. This would also mean that Eumedion is allowed and is able to take a more activist position in case of controversial proposals and/or decisions made by company management. Participants of Eumedion may therefore reconsider the foundation’s mandate to make it more powerful in discussions with company management...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with globalisation and regionalism in Belgium. It is grounded in a theoretical critique of the new regionalism literature. Although accepting its basic claim about the resurgence of {{the region as a}} strategic site for economic governance, I argue that its account of regional resurgence exhibits several weaknesses, amongst others because it ignores the sociopolitical struggles through which collective agency on the regional scale is institutionalised. To overcome these weaknesses, I propose to embed it in a scale-sensitive political economy approach of the restructuring of state spatiality. I substantiate this critique with an empirical analysis of the imagination and institutionalisation of the Flemish regional economy as one concrete expression of globalisation. Given its long history of regionalism, rooted in a territorialised cultural-linguistic struggle and regional uneven economic development, Belgium offers an unique entry point {{for the study of the}} dialectics of regionalism and globalisation. I analyse Flemish economic strategies against the background of a periodisation of the Belgian political-economic development trajectory. Two detailed case studies on recent industrial policy debates in Flanders are presented to elaborate the nature of regional economic imagination and institutionalisation. The first case study focuses on the politics of scale that shaped the regional uneven transition to post-Fordist forms of industrial policy in Belgium. The second case study analyses Flemish anchoring strategies as a specifically Flemish response to globalisation, informed by the Flemish struggle for linguistic-territorial integrity and historical fear for francophone dominance. I conclude that only a scale sensitive political economy approach that focuses on the changing state spatial strategies fully captures the dialectics of regionalism and globalisation. I finally draw attention to the vital role of economic nationalism in Flemish region-building and in mediating the tensions between economic globalisation and Flemish economic nation-building.
