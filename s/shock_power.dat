40|$|PSR 1259 - 63 is a radio pulsar {{orbiting}} a Be star in {{a highly}} eccentric orbit. Soft and hard X-rays are observed from this binary system. We apply the <b>shock</b> <b>powered</b> emission model to this system. The collision of the pulsar and Be star winds forms a shock, which accelerates electrons and positrons to the relativistic energies. We derive the energy distribution of relativistic electrons and positrons {{as a function of}} the distance from the shock in the pulsar nebula. We calculate the X-rays and γ-rays emitted from the relativistic electrons and positrons in the nebula at various orbital phases, taking into account the Klein-Nishina effect fully. The <b>shock</b> <b>powered</b> emission model can explain the observed X-ray properties approximately. We obtain from the comparison with observations that a fraction of ∼ 0. 1 of the pulsar spin-down luminosity should be transformed into the relativistic electrons and positrons. We find that the magnetization parameter of the pulsar wind, the ratio of the Poynting flux to the kinetic energy flux, is ∼ 0. 1 immediately upstream of the termination shock of the pulsar wind, and may decrease with distance from the pulsar. We predict the flux of 10 MeV - 100 GeV γ-rays which may be nearly equal to the detection threshold in the future projects. Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in PAS...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the dynamic behavior of day-ahead spot {{prices in the}} German electricity spot market due to positive structural shocks in wind and solar power. It uses a dynamic structural vector autoregressive model to estimate the related structural impulse response functions. The estimates suggest that wind <b>power</b> <b>shocks</b> have a more prolonged negative effect on spot prices than solar <b>power</b> <b>shocks.</b> These {{may be explained by}} signifcant autocorrelations of wind power for larger lags. The total negative merit order effect of a solar <b>power</b> <b>shock,</b> however, is larger. One reason might be that solar <b>power</b> <b>shocks</b> coincide with demand peaks. Past empirical results show differences in the total average negative merit order effects. The inherently dynamic nature of wind and solar power could explain these dfferences because the dynamics, which are ignored by past studies on the subject using static ordinary least squares estimations, could be transferred to the merit order effects...|$|R

[...] Tex Maule wrote in Sports Illustrated: [...] "Liston's arms are massively muscled, the left jab {{is more than a}} jab.

[...] Johnny Tocco, a trainer who worked with George Foreman and Mike Tyson as well as Liston, said Liston was the hardest hitter of the three. Several boxing writers actually thought Liston could be damaging to the sport because he could not be beaten. Liston's ominous, glowering demeanor was so central to his image that Esquire magazine caused a controversy by posing him in a Santa Claus hat for its December 1963 cover.|$|E
50|$|Another unique {{feature of}} the Roman {{infantry}} was the depth of its spacing. Most ancient armies deployed in shallower formations, particularly phalanx-type forces. Phalanxes might deepen their ranks heavily to add both stamina and <b>shock</b> <b>power,</b> but their general approach still favored one massive line, {{as opposed to the}} deep three-layer Roman arrangement. The advantage of the Roman system is that it allowed the continual funneling or metering of combat power forward over a longer period - massive, steadily renewed pressure to the front - until the enemy broke. Deployment of the second and third lines required careful consideration by the Roman commander. Deployed too early, and they might get entangled in the frontal fighting and become exhausted. Deployed too late, and they might be swept away in a rout if the first line began to break. Tight control had to be maintained, hence the 3rd line triarii were sometimes made to squat or kneel, effectively discouraging premature movement to the front. The Roman commander was thus generally mobile, constantly moving from spot to spot, and often riding back in person to fetch reserves, if {{there was no time for}} standard messenger service. The large number of officers in the typical Roman army, and the flexible breakdown into sub-units like cohorts or maniples greatly aided coordination of such moves.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the most}} feared cavalry in Napoleon's armies were the Polish lancers of the Vistula Uhlans. Nicknamed Hell's Picadors or Los Diablos Polacos (The Polish Devils) by the Spanish, these medium and light horse (Chevau-Légers Lanciers) cavalry had speed nearly equal to the Hussars, <b>shock</b> <b>power</b> almost {{as great as the}} Cuirassiers and were nearly as {{versatile}} as the Dragoons. They were armed with, as their name indicates, lances along with sabres and pistols. Initially French ministers of war insisted on arming all lancers identically, real battlefield experience however proved that the Polish way of arming only the first line with lance while the second rank carried carbine instead was much more practical and thus was adopted. Lancers were the best cavalry for charging against infantry in square, where their lances could outreach the infantry's bayonets, (as happened to Colborne's British brigade at Albuera in 1811) and also in hunting down a routed enemy. Their ability to scour and finish off the wounded without ever stepping off their saddle created perfect scenes of horror for the enemy. They could be deadly against other types of cavalry as well, most famously demonstrated by the fate of Sir William Ponsonby and his Scots Greys at Waterloo. Excluding those of the guard, there were 9 lancer regiments. After the wars, the British were impressed enough to create their own lancer regiments.|$|E

40|$|Cosmological {{shock waves}} are tracers of the thermal {{history of the}} {{structures}} in the Universe. They {{play a crucial role}} in redistributing the energy within the cosmic structures and are also amongst the main ingredients of galaxy and galaxy cluster formation. Understanding this important function requires a proper description of the interplay between shocks and the different environments where they can be found. In this paper, an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) Eulerian cosmological simulation is analysed by means of a shock-finding algorithm that allows to generate shock wave maps. Based on the population of dark matter halos and on the distribution of density contrast in the simulation, we classify the shocks in five different environments. These range from galaxy clusters to voids. The shock distribution function and the <b>shocks</b> <b>power</b> spectrum are studied for these environments dynamics. We find that shock waves on different environments undergo different formation and evolution processes, showing as well different characteristics. We identify three different phases of formation, evolution and dissipation of these shock waves, and an intricate migration between distinct environments and scales. Shock waves initially form at external, low density regions and are merged and amplified through the collapse of structures. Shock waves and cosmic structures follow a parallel evolution. Later on, shocks start to detach from them and dissipate. We also find that most of the <b>power</b> that <b>shock</b> waves dissipate is found at scales of k ∼ 0. 5 Mpc− 1, with a secondary peak at k ∼ 8 Mpc− 1. The evolution of the <b>shocks</b> <b>power</b> spectrum confirms that shock waves evolution is coupled and conditioned by their environment...|$|R

A total of 276 patients with renal calculus were treated by ESWL during December 2001 to December 2006. Of them, the data of 196 patients were used for training the ANN. The predictability of trained ANN was tested on 80 subsequent patients. The input data include age of patient, stone size, stone burden, number of sittings and urinary pH. The output values (predicted values) were number of shocks and <b>shock</b> <b>power.</b> Of these 80 patients, the input was analyzed and output was also calculated by MVRA. The output values (predicted values) from both the methods were compared and the results were drawn. The predicted and observed values of <b>shock</b> <b>power</b> and number of shocks were compared using 1 : 1 slope line. The results were calculated as coefficient of correlation (COC) (r 2). For prediction of power, the MVRA COC was 0. 0195 and ANN COC was 0. 8343. For prediction of number of shocks, the MVRA COC was 0. 5726 and ANN COC was 0. 9329.

The formation of Mg 2 Ni/Ni compound was obtained after only 10  h milling, which {{corresponds to a}} cumulated energy of 57  Wh/g. The as-prepared composite also contains Mg–Ni amorphous phase and residual Ni. When the cumulated energy increases from 57 to 98  Wh/g, less residual Ni and higher Mg 2 Ni contents are obtained. Consequently, an enhancement of the hydrogen absorption capacity was observed from 3.02 to 3.28  H/f.u upon {{the increase in the}} cumulated energy of milling. The combination of mechanical alloying and subsequent annealing at 350  °C for 24  h was able to improve the hydrogen absorption capacity and the hydrogenation kinetics. Independently on the preparation conditions of Mg 2 Ni/Ni powders, nearly 95  % of the hydrogen absorption capacity was reached after 5  h of absorption time. For longer absorption durations, the hydrogenation kinetics becomes very slow due to a drastic decrease of unoccupied sites, available to absorb hydrogen atoms, inside Mg 2 Ni lattice.|$|E
