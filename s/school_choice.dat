5|$|Friedman was an {{advisor to}} Republican U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. His {{political}} philosophy extolled {{the virtues of}} a free market economic system with minimal intervention. He once stated that his role in eliminating U.S. conscription was his proudest accomplishment. In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military, freely floating exchange rates, abolition of medical licenses, a negative income tax, and school vouchers. His support for <b>school</b> <b>choice</b> led him to found the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, later renamed EdChoice.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to tenure reform, Bolger and the House passed legislation that expanded <b>school</b> <b>choice</b> options, guaranteeing more students access to cyber and charter schools; the legislation passed with bipartisan support.

Bryan Adams is among seven Dallas ISD <b>choice</b> <b>schools</b> that are planned to launch {{in the next couple}} of years.

Enrollment is open to students district-wide, but priority is given to students in the school’s attendance zone.|$|R
40|$|As the {{percentage}} of students opting for nonpublic schooling increased in the nineties, private sector choices have diversified, with schools as distinctly different as Afro-centric, Waldorf, Jewish, Muslim, and varieties of Christian schools. Much of the early research in how parents make <b>school</b> <b>choices</b> focused on <b>school</b> climate features rather than curricular considerations. In this study a somewhat isolated population related both by blood and religious association was analyzed in terms of their <b>schooling,</b> <b>choices</b> over a nineteen year period. The PEERS (political, educational, economic, religious, and social attitudes.) Test indicated that although these seven families are highly congruent in their beliefs, their <b>schooling</b> <b>choices</b> were well distributed between public school, a private Christian School with a traditional curriculum, a private Christian school with a continuous progress curriculum (A. C. E.), and homeschooling. The four research questions for this project were: What factors influenced each separate <b>schooling</b> <b>choice?</b> What was the parents' understanding of the curricular differences among their several choices? To what degree did curriculum, affect the parents' final <b>choice</b> of a <b>school?</b> What does the evidence show about parents' ability to make effective choices? The author's participant observation in the test group's cultural milieu for over eight years provided knowledge about the group's thinking processes. Formal exit interviews were recorded and coded for insights on how <b>schooling</b> <b>choices</b> were made. From the analysis of the parents' stated reasons for schooling changes the two most significant findings were the strong influence of adult peer pressure to follow certain trends in <b>schooling</b> <b>choices,</b> and a definite chronological progression ending with strong family commitments to a particular choice. Primary themes which arose, from the exit interviews included parents' ability to recognize individual differences among children, parental understanding of the role of curriculum {{and the role of the}} school environment, specifically safety issues and peer influence. Unexpected themes which arose were supervisory concerns, the question of values, and philosophical issues. While curriculum was concluded not to be a strong factor in parents' decision, the results did confirm parent gains in understanding of curriculum, over time. Results also affirmed parental efficacy in educational decision making...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between abilities, <b>schooling</b> <b>choices,</b> and black-white differentials in labor market outcomes. The analysis {{is based on a}} model of endogenous <b>schooling</b> <b>choices.</b> Agents’ <b>schooling</b> decisions are based on expected future earnings, family background, and unobserved abilities. Earnings are also determined by unobserved abilities. The analysis distinguishes unobserved abilities from observed test scores. The model is implemented using data from the NLSY 79. The results indicate that, even after controlling for abilities, there exist significant racial labor market gaps. They also suggest that the standard practice of equating observed test scores may overcompensate for differentials in ability. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} role of youths' own choice-conditioned {{expectations}} in understanding their <b>schooling</b> <b>choices</b> by constructing a choice (or "switching") model. We emphasize the effect of individual student perceptions regarding the returns associated with {{graduating from high school}} versus dropping out, while controlling for an extensive set of family and community factors. We find that youths' expected income returns to graduating from high school are influential in their <b>schooling</b> <b>choices,</b> even when an extensive set of background, economic, family, and neighborhood variables, designed to capture the effects of parental and governmental decisions, is introduced into the analysis.

25|$|Various {{attempts}} at program reform have been attempted. In one reform, individual schools were given more authority over day-to-day decisions and public <b>school</b> <b>choice,</b> authored by {{school board member}} Yolie Flores was implemented. In the 1990s, the Los Angeles Education Alliance for Restructuring Now (LEARN) and the Los Angeles Annenberg Metropolitan Project (LAAMP) were created, giving principals even more authority {{to make changes in}} curriculum hopefully benefiting students. Regardless, student achievement failed to increase.|$|E

The program as enacted by the Board did not give any incentive for anyone to alter their religious views.|$|E

25|$|Most Republicans support <b>school</b> <b>choice</b> through {{charter schools}} and school {{vouchers}} for private schools; denounce {{the performance of}} the urban public school system and the teachers' unions. The party has insisted on a system of greater accountability for public schools, most prominently in recent years with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Many Republicans, including Ronald Reagan, opposed the creation of the United States Department of Education when it was initially created in 1979.|$|E
