40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyses}} {{the channels}} {{through which the}} economic and financial crisis of 2008 – 2009 was transmitted to Sub-Saharan Africa, {{with a focus on}} countries in <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fragility.</b> Trade stands out as the main direct channel, even though intra-Africa remittances play a relevant role, given that most migrants in Sub-Saharan Africa cannot afford the cost of migrating to Europe or to the United States and stay close, remaining in the continent. Whether reduced aid flows also act as a crisis transmission channel remains an open question, even though preliminary estimates suggest that, at least in the medium run, OECD countries are likely to lower aid, with potentially very damaging effects. The paper also shows that many African countries in a <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fragility</b> are characterised by very low resilience and capacity to cope with shocks. It concludes, by highlighting how Sub-Saharan Africa (fragile countries’) policymakers’ room for manoeuver is limited in periods of crisis because of low fiscal space and limited institutional capacity. It advocates that the right response to the crisis would be to mobilise domestic resources, although this will require functional institutions able to offset the potential trade-offs between adverse short-term shocks and a long-term perspective...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} philanthropia is often {{associated}} with that of compassion and characterizes, ideally, the relations between the powerful and those who are found to be in a <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fragility</b> and impotence. The intention {{of this study is to}} show how, in the Lives of Demosthenes and Cicero, this notion of philanthropia takes on a tragic tone, one which is reinforced by theallusions to Sophocles's Antigone, a play which seems to serve as an ethical frame of reference for the evaluation of the protagonists' ethos in crucial moments of their lives...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this communication is to present the main results of the research project MAPISE, entitled "Seniors at walk, a sustainable way of moving?" (La marche à pied pour les séniors, un mode de déplacement durable ?), financed by the Research Program on Innovation in Ground Transport, which ended in 2014. The research on three urban sites {{in the metropolitan area}} of Lille (North of France) was conducted by three research institutions: the research laboratoire "Space, nature and cultures" (co-financed by the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and U. Paris-Sorbonne), the Québec National Institute for Scientific Research (INRS), and the French Institute for Sciences and Technologies of transport, Network management and development (IFSTTAR). Based principally on a vast survey, additional informations was gathered through: 1) A non-participating observations of pedestrians of all the ages in situations of crossing the street; they were then met on an special sidewalk in order to get their age and other information; 2) A detailed and precise mapping of all pedestrians' follow-ups through a specific Geographical Information system (SIG) program; 3) An evaluation and the mapping of the walking potential of the three urban sites. The results show that in spite of a decreasing mobility over the years, older people walk most of the time to move around the city. However, for people over 75 years old, we observed a decrease in the frequency of movements (all modes of transport included), an increase in the risk of accidents, as well as the largest number of falls in the public space. As for crossing pattern, without much surprise we found that careful and rule-abiding behavior increases with age. Indeed, older pedestrians put into place compensation strategies to their declining physical abilities, such as no rush or run when approaching the crossing path, and while crossing; wait for the green light on the sidewalk, rather than in the street; look at the ground before crossing, rather checking the traffic. On the walking potential of the studied urban sites, we proceeded out of a "walkability" index we created based on the existing scientific literature. It distinguishes several limitations to walking practices, most notably, {{the presence or absence of}} obstacles on the road, its unevenness, the absence of benches, the remoteness of businesses, insufficient lighting, the fear of being pushed or knocked down, the fear of bad encounters, and the feeling of insecurity. Globally, the study revealed, for walking practices by the elderly, a strong correlation between the comfort and safety of urban spaces, which puts into light the difference, or even oppose, the well-maintained main streets to the secondary streets with narrow sidewalks and poor pavements, sometimes in slope. The walkability audit we held highlighted several elements that would favor movement by seniors in terms of safety, of walking balance and of crossing easiness: that is, narrower crossing paths, decongestion of sidewalks, and quality of pavements that allows a comfortable walk. In the end, much more than age, the health factor presides over people's choice of the ways they move within the urban space. Walking becomes a favored ways of moving at an age it turns out to be the most difficult to implement, because of the physical and possible psychic declines. In this, we can identify two sub-groups within the heterogeneous population of the elderly. For one, seniors exhibit similar mobility pattern and behavior than the average healthy adults. In the second, we find elderly moving with difficulties. Within the MAPISE project, and survey, walking as a way of moving to be promoted appears to be of little interest for older people. However, walking has become more than a simple way mode moving, it is a way a way of "being in town", and to be alive!In closing, we would like to suggest that future studies on the mobility of the elderly should preferably target a population in <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fragility</b> that has not yet suffered a loss of autonomy, but has started to deal with the burden of ageing...|$|E

Key Messages • �Whilst the global fight against poverty is progressing, a group of 45 countries in <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> acute <b>fragility</b> continue to fall behind. In addition, the global financial crisis, social unrest, growing population pressures and environmental degradation may lead to new or renewed <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> <b>fragility.</b> • �For the development and stabilisation of these countries, aid is only one part of an equation that also includes domestic revenues, foreign direct investment and remittances. The coherence of global policies on trade, investment, agriculture, security, energy, migration and illicit flows matters just as much as aid volumes. • �At the same time, aid can have a vital, countercyclical role, particularly in times of turmoil. For this role to be realised, however, aid needs to be targeted towards peacebuilding and statebuilding goals, its allocation optimised across countries, and its quality improved. Why focus on fragile situations? Over the past 25 years, the share of poor people living in developing countries has been cut by half. But a group of 45 countries is falling behind, representing 1. 2 billion people (see Figure 1). 1 In these countries, people are {{more than twice as likely}} to be undernourished as those in other developing countries. They are more than three times less likely to be able to send their children to school. Children in these countries are more than twice as likely to die before their fifth birthday. Unless we make better progress at accelerating development results in fragile states, we cannot claim much success in the global fight against poverty. 1 �The list of countries in fragile situations used for this analysis (neither an official DAC list nor an official definition) and included in Figures 7 and 8 is a compilation of two lists...|$|R
40|$|Currently, over a {{third of}} {{children}} not in school live in countries considered being as fragile or affected by an armed conflict. These countries, which are mainly located in sub-Saharan Africa, will not reach the objectives of Education For All for 2015. This paper covers approaches across comparative education, political science and sociology of organizations. The question is: what prospects for international assistance on education in fragile states and countries affected by armed conflict? Our study explores empirically the conditions of intervention of international aid within the contexts <b>of</b> <b>fragility</b> and armed conflict.

40|$|Crucial {{social and}} {{cultural}} elements underpin state institutions and ensure that they function.

Such an approach would help re-integrate the intangible dimensions that constitute the substantive content of institutions, their ethos, beyond their mere forms. Based upon concrete experiences in different African countries, this paper explains what these intangible dimensions are in three of the sectors usually concerned with reforms (politics, justice and security), and why they are important and should be better integrated in analyses, intervention strategies and aid programmes. An equally important dimension of such integration is that it would also allow better consideration of local capacities and resources to be taken, in particular in terms of resilience, and would allow it to go beyond the impression of vacuum or chaos too often given to <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> <b>fragility.</b> Finally, the paper presents some concrete recommendations to integrate these dimensions better into the priorities and modalities of European aid, as well as suggest a few avenues for further research on the subject. state building; institutions...|$|R

40|$|The European Report on Development (ERD) is {{the main}} outcome of the Mobilising European {{research}} for development policies, an initiative promoted and financed by the European Commission together with seven EU Member States: Germany, Finland, France, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The aim of this initiative {{is to help the}} European Union refine its vision of development and enrich its policies on the basis of knowledge, innovation, and the building of common ground between the European research community, policymakers, and a broad public. The ERD is aimed at stimulating debate and research on development issues and amplifying the EU’s voice internationally. The ERD provides linkages and synergies between rich expertise in development-related issues in research and academic institutions and policymaking throughout Europe. It also serves as a focal point for researchers in European countries and various regions of the world, facilitates discussions with policymakers and civil society, and stimulates interaction between various European national agencies. The European Report on Development will help the European Union to refine its vision on development, enrich its policies and influence the international debate. It will also complement other flagship reports on development, in an attempt to reflect the diversity of views that may coexist on various issues and – where relevant – the specific European approaches, based both on Europe’s political and social values and its own history and experience. Indeed, we are convinced that there should not be any monopoly of thinking in a field as complex and rich as development policy.
