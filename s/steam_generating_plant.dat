Since Sheridan Hollow is a ravine and the smoke stacks are high enough to be at the level with the surrounding rim most of the pollution from the stacks ended up in neighboring Arbor Hill. Allen Hershkowitz, director of the Solid Waste and Energy Project for INFORM, a conservation research organization, said of the plant in 1986 that it [...] "is the worst plant I've seen in the world." [...] The garbage burning aspect of the plant was closed in 1994 by order of Governor Mario Cuomo.|$|E
50|$|Most boilers produce {{steam to}} be used at {{saturation}} temperature; that is, saturated steam. Superheated steam boilers vaporize the water and then further heat the steam in a superheater. This provides steam at much higher temperature, but can decrease the overall thermal efficiency of the <b>steam</b> <b>generating</b> <b>plant</b> because the higher steam temperature requires a higher flue gas exhaust temperature. There {{are several ways to}} circumvent this problem, typically by providing an economizer that heats the feed water, a combustion air heater in the hot flue gas exhaust path, or both. There are advantages to superheated steam that may, and often will, increase overall efficiency of both steam generation and its utilization: gains in input temperature to a turbine should outweigh any cost in additional boiler complication and expense. There may also be practical limitations in using wet steam, as entrained condensation droplets will damage turbine blades.|$|E

Fewer than half of Arkansas farm homes had electricity in 1948. REA-affiliated cooperatives, however, guided by Harry L. Oswald, for 32 years their Arkansas general manager and a fervent McMath loyalist, were able to open service to those areas by 1956 {{as the result of}} Co-op-enabling legislation, including authorization for the building of <b>steam</b> <b>generating</b> <b>plants,</b> which was enacted by Congress in large part at McMath's behest.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the founders}} {{originally}} planned to make board from wheat straw, they turned instead to wastepaper {{as the primary}} raw material; thus Tennessee Paper became the first recycled paperboard mill in the South. To reduce its electric bill, the company installed its own <b>steam</b> <b>generating</b> <b>plant</b> in 1926. Paperboard production averaged 20 tons {{a day in the}} early years, reaching an average of 56.77 tons in 1930, the same year that the company produced a record 15,557 tons of product. This figure would not be matched for some time because of the Great Depression; production dropped to 11,995 tons in 1934. The company remained profitable, however, although only modestly so. As the nation's economy slowly recovered, Tennessee Paper's volume of business increased to meet renewed demand. During 1939 the factory operated at 85 percent capacity, compared with the industry average of 71 percent. In 1941, it operated a record 305 days. Sales volume exceeded $1.7 million in 1945. A second papermaking machine doubled the mill's capacity in 1949.|$|E
5000|$|The Kirk is a {{historic}} building located in Mason City, Iowa, United States. Completed in 1903, this was the city's first luxury apartment building.

McClellan was the ranking member of the Army-McCarthy subcommittee, whose hearings were televised live during the lead-up to the election. Liberal senators Hubert Humphrey, Stuart Symington and others, as well as Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson, signed newspaper ads supporting McClellan. Moses had similarly partnered with McClellan's predecessor, Joe T. Robinson, who prior to his death in 1937 had used his considerable power as Senate majority leader to divert the New Deal's showcase Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) public electricity generating project away from the Arkansas River, the basin for which it was originally proposed. Moses, who had supported McMath in 1948 but had since cooled toward him, brought AP&L's entire board of directors to the governor's office just prior to the 1952 candidate filing deadline to lobby McMath against the building of the initial <b>steam</b> <b>generating</b> <b>plant,</b> at Ozark, Arkansas. They promised to aid McMath's third-term re-election bid, in spite of past differences, if he would withdraw his support for the plant. The governor heard the businessmen out, but reaffirmed his commitment to Co-op power. Shortly afterward, four heavily AP&L-funded gubernatorial candidates filed against McMath, one of whom, Chancery Judge Francis Cherry of Jonesboro, defeated him in the August primary run-off during which Cherry hosted a round-the-clock radio [...] "talkathon" [...] lambasting [...] "the McMath Highway Scandal."

40|$|Abstract. In this {{research}} work, an attempt {{has been made}} to investigate the gas tungsten arc welded Monel 400 plates using ENiCu- 7 for its mechanical and corrosion properties. Microstructure examination reveals the coarse grain formation of Ni-Cu phase in the heat affected zone (HAZ) and well defined dendrites are observed in the weld region. Tensile tests showed that fracture occurred at the weld interface and the ultimate tensile strength of the Monel weldment is found to be 515 MPa. Furthermore hot corrosion studies were performed on the different zones (Weld, HAZ and Base metal) of Monel 400 exposed to the thin film of molten salt environment of Na 2 SO 4 - 60 % V 2 O 5 at 600 °C. It was found that corrosion was extremely severe on the fusion zone after exposed to 50 cycles. The corrosion products were characterized using the combined techniques of optical microscopy, XRD, SEM/EDX analysis. Monel, a Nickel- copper based alloy has versatile applications in marine, petro-chemical, chemical processing applications because of its excellent strength and corrosion resistant properties. High temperature corrosion was first recognized as a serious problem in 1940 s in connection with the degradation of fireside boiler tubes in coal-fired <b>steam</b> <b>generating</b> <b>plants.</b> Rapp et al [1] reporte...|$|R
