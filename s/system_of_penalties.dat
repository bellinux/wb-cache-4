60|$|And men's concern {{under this}} ampler view {{will no longer}} be to work out a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>penalties</b> for the sins of dead men, but to {{understand}} and participate in this great development that now dawns on the human understanding. The insoluble problems of pain and death, gaunt, incomprehensible facts as they were, fall into place in the gigantic order that evolution unfolds. All things are integral in the mighty scheme, the slain builds up the slayer, the wolf grooms the horse into swiftness, and the tiger calls for wisdom and courage out of man. All things are integral, but it has been left for men to be consciously integral, to take, at last, a share in the process, to have wills that have caught a harmony with the universal will, as sand grains flash into splendour under the blaze of the sun. There will be many who will never be called to this religious conviction, who will lead their little lives like fools, playing foolishly with religion and all the great issues of life, or like the beasts that perish, having sense alone; but those who, by character and intelligence, are predestinate to participate in the reality of life, will fearlessly shape all their ethical determinations and public policy anew, from a fearless study of themselves and the apparent purpose that opens out before them.|$|E

The {{paper is composed of}} five parts. Chapter One introduces Czechoslovak historical predecessors <b>of</b> the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> points and examines the development of its current legal regulation in the Highway Traffic Act. The second part deals with fundamental principles <b>of</b> the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> points and particularly assesses the function of prevention principle. The following chapter analyzes the actual legal regulation <b>of</b> the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> points. The author warns against relating insufficiencies and recommends the appropriate solution. The goal of the Chapter Four is based on survey of the fact, whether the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> points represents the sanction by its nature. The author critically researches the proportionality <b>of</b> the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> points and its accordance with the Czech constitutional order. This chapter also concerns with judicial decisions of Czech courts and the European Court of Human Rights referring to the character <b>of</b> the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> points.

50|$|The new law {{provided}} {{greater access}} {{for the public}} to official documents, and sets forth a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>penalties</b> for public officials who refused to disclose information. The new legislation includes also an array of new concepts, such as the possibility of reclassifying secret documents, the release of partial information and the use of ICTs to make information held py public bodies available and accessible to the public. The law also establishes the obligation to appoint coordinators for access to information by every public authority charged with the task of supervising the authority’s responses to information requests and created the institution of a Commissioner for the Right to Information and Protection of Personal Data charged with supervising and monitoring compliance with the law and appeals bodies and procedures in cases of refusal or partial disclosure. Under the new law the Commissioner has the faculty to use disciplinary sanctions against those violating the requirements established in the law. The sanction system for failure to respect the right to information has been strengthened with the introduction of heavy administrative sanctions for officials violating the law.|$|E
5000|$|Medicare and Medicaid {{currently}} pay clinicians {{the same}} amount regardless of results. But there is a pilot program to increase payments for doctors who deliver high-quality care at lower cost, while reducing payments for those who deliver low-quality care at higher cost. There’s a program that would pay bonuses to hospitals that improve patient results after heart failure, pneumonia, and surgery. There’s a program that would impose financial penalties on institutions with high rates of infections transmitted by health-care workers. Still another would test a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>penalties</b> and rewards scaled {{to the quality of}} home health and rehabilitation care. Other experiments try moving medicine away from fee-for-service payment altogether. A bundled-payment provision would pay medical teams just one thirty-day fee for all the outpatient and inpatient services related to, say, an operation. This would give clinicians an incentive to work together to smooth care and reduce complications. One pilot would go even further, encouraging clinicians to band together into “Accountable Care Organizations” that take responsibility for all their patients’ needs, including prevention—so that fewer patients need operations in the first place. These groups would be permitted to keep part of the savings they generate, as long as they meet quality and service thresholds. The bill has ideas for changes {{in other parts of the}} system, too. Some provisions attempt to improve efficiency through administrative reforms, by, for example, requiring insurance companies to create a single standardized form for insurance reimbursement, to alleviate the clerical burden on clinicians. There are tests of various kinds of community wellness programs. The legislation also continues a stimulus-package program that funds comparative-effectiveness research—testing existing treatments for a condition against one another—because fewer treatment failures should mean lower costs.|$|E
