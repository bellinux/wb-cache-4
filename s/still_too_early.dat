Each victim's throat had been slit with such great force as to be nearly decapitated. Thousands of dollars worth of marijuana and cash were left covering the victims' bodies, and $5,000 was left at the scene. The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other.

Second, on the positive role authoritarian governments can play in economic growth, {{especially in the case of}} China, the fast economic growth could be part of the catch-up effect. However, it does not mean that authoritarian governments are better than democratic governments in promoting economic growth.

5000|$|Despite {{a number}} of {{attempts}} at reunification, the split proved permanent. As time passed, more ideological differences emerged.

Thus, they criticized the competition program for understating the value and importance of the existing park design, and they encouraged conceiving of the project as a new memorial within an existing park."

40|$|The Great Depression of the 1930 s and the Great Credit Crisis of the 2000 s {{had similar}} causes but {{elicited}} strikingly different policy responses.

We employ vector autoregressions, instrumental variables, and qualitative evidence for a panel of 27 countries in the period 1925 - 1939. The results suggest that monetary and fiscal stimulus was effective – that where it did not make a difference it was not tried. The results also shed light on the debate over fiscal multipliers in episodes of financial crisis. They are consistent with multipliers at the higher end of those estimated in the recent literature, consistent with the idea that the impact of fiscal stimulus will be greater when banking system are dysfunctional and monetary policy is constrained by the zero bound. ...|$|R

30|$|To summarize, on {{the face}} of it, there have been some {{important}} changes in the field of legislation on employment protection, an institution that was considered highly path-dependent before the crisis. Overall, there is a trend {{in some of the most}} segmented countries towards lower dismissal costs for permanent workers in combination with a moderate (and sometimes ambiguous) re-regulation of temporary contracts. Overall, this tends to narrow the regulatory gap between permanent and temporary contracts at least to some extent. Nonetheless, have these changes contributed to reducing segmentation? Given that many of the reforms have only been implemented in the past three to 5  years—in a situation with limited labor demand in most of the countries—it might <b>still</b> be <b>too</b> <b>early</b> to evaluate their impact on hiring practices with currently available data. However, revisiting Fig.  1 casts some doubt on their effectiveness, showing that the share of temporary contracts has even increased in the countries that deregulated EPL during the crisis. Between 2010 and 2014, the share of workers aged 15 – 29 increased by roughly seven percentage points in Italy and Spain, three in France and Portugal and one in Greece. Of course, we do not have a counterfactual situation, thus making it difficult to assess the exact influence of the reforms.|$|R
