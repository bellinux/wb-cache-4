It is important to create applicable and valid soil quality indicators in order to both identify areas with potential productivity problems and monitor soil quality changes due {{to a range of}} perturbations. In this work we compared several chemical and biological variables between a Mediterranean soil characterized by intensive horticulture that has been irrigated for 20 years with moderately saline waters (IM) and an adjacent soil, subjected to a sustainable agricultural production management and irrigated with plain water (<b>SM).</b> <b>Soil</b> sampling was repeated three times during a year in both sites. IM soil had lower pH, organic carbon and total nitrogen compared to <b>SM</b> <b>soil</b> at all sampling times, while its electrical conductivity was significantly higher at two sampling times only. Potentially mineralizable nitrogen pointed out significant differences only at the first sampling time, with lower levels in the <b>SM</b> <b>soil.</b> &beta;-sitosterol, cholesterol and ergosterol varied significantly with sampling time and were influenced also by management. Statistical approach by Principal Component Analysis highlighted a contrast between two groups of soil variables: potentially mineralizable nitrogen and sterols mainly weighted on the first axis, while chemical properties, weighted on the second one. Moreover, the second axis separated the soil subjected to a sustainable agricultural production system from that subjected to intensive practice management, while the first axis separated the third sampling data from the first two...|$|E
40|$|Long-term global {{satellite}} and reanalysis soil moisture products {{have been available}} for several years. In this study, in situ soil moisture measurements from 2008 to 2012 over Southwest China are {{used to evaluate the}} accuracy of four satellite-based products and one reanalysis soil moisture product. These products are the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E), the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), the European Space Agency’s Climate Change Initiative soil moisture (CCI SM), and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim). The evaluation of soil moisture absolute values and anomalies shows that all the products can capture the temporal dynamics of in situ soil moisture well. For AMSR-E and SMOS, larger errors occur, which are likely due to the severe effects of radio frequency interference (RFI) over the test region. In general, the ERA-Interim (R = 0. 782, ubRMSD = 0. 035 m 3 /m 3) and CCI SM (R = 0. 723, ubRMSD = 0. 046 m 3 /m 3) perform the best compared to the other products. The accuracy levels obtained are comparable to validation results from other regions. Therefore, local hydrological applications and water resource management will benefit from the long-term ERA-Interim and CCI <b>SM</b> <b>soil</b> moisture products...|$|E
40|$|Geological and {{geotechnical}} investigations involving detailed geologic mapping and composite {{soil sample}} laboratory tests respectively, {{have been carried}} out at Ganawuri, North Central Nigeria with a view to delineating the different rock units in the area and their Engineering significance. The area is underlain by the Crystalline Basement rocks composed of Granite Gneiss with late Diorite, Basalts and Pegmatite intrusions. The older units have been intruded by the Biotite Granite of the Younger Granite province, occurring as a ridge bordering the northeastern margin of the area. Structures observed in the area include fault/shear zones, pegmatite dykes, basaltic dykes and fractures. The dominant trend is in the NE-SW direction with local deviations in NNE-SSW, WNW-ESE, NW-SE and NNW–SSE. The joints are generally vertical with few dipping steeply to the SE or SW. Thus it is evident that the early NNW-SSE trending foliation in the granite gneiss guided the regional structural development in the area. This feature thus controlled all the other structures (anticline, shear zones, fractures and the river channel), all of which are oriented in the same direction. This dominant NE-SW trend may be associated with development of the Benue Valley of Nigeria. Composite soil samples were obtained at different points around the area and laboratory analysis carried out on them. Using the Unified soil classification system (USCS), soil sample I was classified as <b>SM</b> <b>soils</b> with zero plasticity, samples 2 and 3 soils were classified as SC, CL and SC, OH soil...|$|R
40|$|A common {{explanation}} for intense soil erosion and gullying in SE Australia {{is the introduction}} by Europeans of new land use practices following their arrival in Australia in the late 18 th century. Eucalyptus woodlands were cleared to introduce farming, and valley bottoms, characterized by chains of ponds with organic-rich swampy meadow (<b>SM)</b> <b>soils,</b> were subsequently buried by thick deposits of ‘post-settlement alluvium’ (PSA) generated by erosion in the catchment. In this study, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) is {{used to evaluate the}} source(s) of the PSA in Grabben Gullen Creek (GGC), Australia. We use a portable OSL reader to measure total photon counts on bulk polymineral and polygrain-size samples from nine profiles along the Creek. We use these luminescence signals as geotracers of sediment source(s) and transport pathways. We obtained higher luminescence signals in the PSA than in the SM sediments, suggesting different sources and fluvial transport conditions for these two widespread sedimentary units. Portable OSL reader data from soils in the GGC catchment that are potential sources for the SM sediments and PSA show that the high luminescence signals recorded in the PSA are similar to those from subsoil samples in granite soils, suggesting that the PSA was derived by gullying of granite subsoils. In the SM sediments, luminescence signals decrease upwards {{from the base of the}} profile, as expected in well-reset fluvial deposits, but with one or more changes in gradient in the profile of photon counts with depth, most likely indicating changes in sediment deposition rates. To calculate deposition rates in the SM sediments, several samples were dated using OSL. The OSL ages produced low scatter in the equivalent doses, confirming the well-reset nature of the grains composing the SM and indicating a process of sediment transport in dilute flows, as is interpreted from the portable OSL signals.

In the last years, several satellite missions have been launched especially to derive large-scale products of the SM dynamics on the Earth. However, in situ validation data are often scarce. We developed a new method to retrieve <b>SM</b> of bare <b>soil</b> from measurements of low-cost GPS (Global Positioning System) sensors that receive the freely available GPS L 1 -band signals.

The results show high agreement with measured and modelled SM validation data.

40|$|The {{availability}} of satellite-derived global surface soil moisture products {{during the last}} decade has opened up great opportunities to incorporate these observations into applications in hydrology, meteorology, and climatic modeling. This study evaluates a new global soil moisture product developed under the framework of the European Space Agency (ESA) climate change initiative (CCI), using finer spatial resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and ground-based measurements of soil moisture. The analysis is carried out over selected in situ networks over Ireland, Spain, and Finland with the aim of assessing the temporal representativeness of the coarse-scale CCI essential climate variable (ECV) soil moisture (ECV SM) product in these different areas. A good agreement (correlation coefficient (R) values between 0. 53 and 0. 92) was observed between the three soil moisture data sets for the Irish and Spanish sites while a reasonable agreement (R values between 0. 41 and 0. 52) was observed between the SAR and ECV <b>SM</b> <b>soil</b> moisture data sets at the Finnish sites. Overall, the two different satellite-derived products captured the soil moisture temporal variations well and were in good agreement with each other, highlighting the confidence of using the coarse-scale ECV SM product to track soil moisture variability in time...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of the long-term addition of three compost types (vegetable, fruit and yard waste compost - VFYW, garden waste compost - GW and spent mushroom compost - SM) on the physical properties of a sandy soil and to quantify any such effects using indicators of soil physical quality. Soil samples were taken from a field with annual compost applications of 30 m 3 /ha for 10 yr and various physico-chemical analyses were undertaken. Results show a significant increase in soil organic carbon (21 %) with the VFYW and GW compost types. With <b>SM,</b> <b>soil</b> organic carbon increased by 16 %. Increased soil macroporosity and water content at saturation with a corresponding decrease in bulk density were observed for all compost types. However, quantification of these improvements using existing soil physical quality indicators such as the 'S-index', soil air capacity and matrix porosity gave mixed results showing that these indices perform poorly when applied to sandy soils. It is concluded that the long-term application of compost does not significantly improve the physical properties of sandy soils, but the absence of adverse effects suggests that these soils are a viable disposal option for these composts, but new indices of quality are needed for the proper characterization of sandy soils...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{moisture}} (SM) plays a {{key role}} in many environmental processes and has a high spatial and temporal variability. Collecting sample SM data through field surveys (e. g., for validation of remote sensing-derived products) can be very expensive and time consuming if a study area is large, and producing accurate SM maps from the sample point data is a difficult task as well. In this study, geospatial processing techniques are used to combine several geo-environmental layers relevant to <b>SM</b> (<b>soil,</b> geology, rainfall, land cover, etc.) into a land unit area (LUA) map, which delineates regions with relatively homogeneous geological/geomorphological, land use/land cover, and climate characteristics. This LUA map is used to guide the collection of sample SM data in the field, and the field data is finally spatially interpolated to create a wall-to-wall map of SM in the study area (Garmsar, Iran). The main goal of this research is to create a SM map in an arid area, using a land unit area (LUA) approach to obtain the most appropriate sample locations for collecting SM field data. Several environmental GIS layers, which have an impact on SM, were combined to generate a LUA map, and then field surveying was done in each class of the LUA map. A SM map was produced based on LUA, remote sensing data indexes, and spatial interpolation of the field survey sample data. The several interpolation methods (inverse distance weighting, kriging, and co-kriging) were evaluated for generating SM maps from the sample data. The produced maps were compared to each other and validated using ground truth data. The results show that the LUA approach is a reasonable method to create the homogenous field to introduce a representative sample for field soil surveying. The geostatistical SM map achieved adequate accuracy; however, trend analysis and distribution of the soil sample point locations within the LUA types should be further investigated to achieve even better results. Co-kriging produced the most accurate SM map of the study area...|$|E

On ferruginous soils, better correlation of intra-seasonal variations and stronger sensitivity of the vegetation to rainfall are found compared to lithosols soils. LAI responds, on average, two to three weeks after a rainfall anomaly. Moreover, dry spells (negative anomalies) of seven days’ length (three days for SM anomaly) significantly affect vegetation growth (maximum LAI within the season). A strong and significant link is also found between total precipitation and the number of dry spells.

Microbial communities were analyzed based on the ITS region for fungi and 16 S rRNA gene for bacteria using qPCR and tag-pyrosequencing with 454 GS FLX titanium technology. A dramatic decrease in fungal populations (~ 85 % reduction) was observed after allyl ITC addition. Fungal community compositions also shifted following ITC amendments (e. g., Humicola increased in allyl and Mortierella in butyl ITC amendments). Bacterial populations were less impacted by ITCs, although there was atransient increase in the proportion of Firmicutes, related to bacteria know to be antagonistic to plant pathogens, following amendment with allyl ITC. Our results indicate that the type of ITC released from SMs can result in differential impacts on soil microorganisms.

The mission should also deliver information on root zone soil moisture, vegetation, and biomass, and lead to significant {{research in the field}} of the cryosphere. The main aspects of the baseline mission are presented in this paper. Over land, water and energy fluxes at the surface/atmosphere interface are strongly dependent upon <b>soil</b> moisture (<b>SM).</b> Evaporation, infiltration and runoff are driven by <b>SM</b> while <b>soil</b> moisture in the vadose zone governs the rate of water uptake by vegetation. Soil moisture is thus a key variable in the hydrologic cycle. Soil moisture, and its spatiotemporal evolution as such, is an important variable for numerical weather and climate models, and should be accounted for in hydrology and vegetation monitoring. For the oceans, sea surface salinity (SSS) {{plays an important role in}} the Northern Atlantic sub polar area, where intrusions with a low salinity influence the deep thermohaline circulation and the meridional heat transport. Variations in salinity also influence the near-surface dynamics of tropical oceans, where rainfall modifies the buoyancy of the surface layer and the tropical ocean-atmosphere heat fluxes. SSS fields and their seasonal and inter-annual variabilities are thus tracers and constraints on the water cycle and on the coupled ocean-atmosphere models.

The assimilation is evaluated using the unbiased mean square error (ubMSE) relative to watershed-scale in situ observations, with the ubMSE separated into contributions from the subseasonal (SM short), mean seasonal (SM seas), and inter-annual (<b>SM</b> long) <b>soil</b> moisture dynamics. For near-surface soil moisture, the average ubMSE for Catchment without assimilation was (1. 8 × 10 − 3 m 3 m − 3) 2, of which 19 % was in SM long, 26 % in SM seas, and 55 % in SM short. The AMSR-E assimilation significantly reduced the total ubMSE at every site, with an average reduction of 33 %. Of this ubMSE reduction, 37 % occurred in SM long, 24 % in SM seas, and 38 % in SM short. For root-zone soil moisture, in situ observations were available at one site only, and the near-surface and root-zone results were very similar at this site. These results suggest that, {{in addition to the}} well-reported improvements in SM short, assimilating a sufficiently long soil moisture data record can also improve the model representation of important long-term events, such as droughts. The improved agreement between the modeled and in situ SM seas is harder to interpret, given that mean seasonal cycle errors are systematic, and systematic errors are not typically targeted by (bias-blind) data assimilation. Finally, the use of 1 -year subsets of the AMSR-E and Catchment soil moisture for estimating the observation-bias correction (rescaling) parameters is investigated. It is concluded that when only 1 year of data are available, the associated uncertainty in the rescaling parameters should not greatly reduce the average benefit gained from data assimilation, although locally and in extreme years there is a risk of increased errors...|$|R

Bacillus weihenstephanensis SM 3 showed {{a high degree of}} resistance to nickel (1500 mg l- 1), copper (500 mg l- 1) and zinc (700 mg l- 1) and also to antibiotics (ampicillin, penicillin, kanamycin and streptomycin). Strain SM 3 has also exhibited the capability of solubilizing phosphate and producing indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) both in the absence and in the presence of metals (Ni, Cu and Zn). A pot experiment was conducted to elucidate the effects of strain SM 3 on plant growth and uptake of Ni, Cu or Zn by Helianthus annuus. Inoculation with strain SM 3 increased the shoot and root biomass of H. annuus grown in both non-contaminated and contaminated <b>soil.</b> Furthermore, strain <b>SM</b> 3 increased the accumulation of Cu and Zn in the root and shoot systems. A batch experiment was also conducted to assess the metal mobilization potential of strain <b>SM</b> 3 in <b>soil.</b> Inoculation with this strain increased the concentrations of water soluble Ni, Cu and Zn in soil.

The availability of land for growing crops is limited; it may become inevitable to utilize marginal and problem soils. Sulfur deficiency has become widespread {{over the past several}} decades in most of the agricultural areas of the world including Bangladesh, which have need of sustainable measures for their reclamation. The content of available sulfur in the soils were increased by the application of <b>SM,</b> regardless of <b>soil</b> conditions and the effects were significantly positive (p≤ 0. 05) with the ahead of time in compared to other treatments like gypsum, magnesium sulfate etc. At the same time, all the rates of SM showed the significantly (p≤ 0. 05) positive effects on organic matter status in the soils and increments were more striking with the higher rates. This means the SM has potential and effective impacts than that of gypsum or magnesium sulfate not only as a source of fertilizer but also to enrich the fertility and productivity status of <b>soil.</b> Moreover, the <b>SM</b> treatment was found to be maintained the high nutrient status in the soil till the final harvest at maturity of different crops, reflecting a good indication for its long term use.

In-situ SM observations together with a remotely sensed SM dataset retrieved by the Vienna University of Technology are used to validate the model. In the VIP model, climate-eco-hydrological (CEH) variables such as precipitation, air temperature and runoff observations and also simulated evapotranspiration (ET), leaf area index (LAI), and vegetation production are {{used to analyze the}} soil moisture evolution mechanism. The results show that the model is able to capture seasonal SM variations. The seasonal pattern, multi-year variation, standard deviation and coefficient of variation (CV) of SM at the daily, monthly and annual scale are well explained by CEH variables. The annual and inter-annual variability of SM is the lowest compared with that of other CEH variables. The trend analysis shows that SM is in decreasing tendency at α= 0. 01 level of significance, confirming the Northern Drying phenomenon. This trend can be well explained by the decreasing tendency of precipitation (α= 0. 1) and increasing tendency of temperature (α= 0. 01). The decreasing tendency of runoff has higher significance level (α= 0. 001). Because of <b>SM's</b> decreasing tendency, <b>soil</b> evaporation (ES) is also decreasing (α= 0. 05).

Although these wastes {{have a high}} fertilizer value when applied to the soil, there is concern about their use because of their antimicrobial and phytotoxic properties. Furthermore, their effect on saprophytic growth and pathogenicity of soilborne and foliar fungi is poorly known. In this study we investigated the effects of olive mill dry residue (DOR) on: (a) growth of the four crop species Lepidium sativum, Lycopersicon esculentum, Lactuca sativa and Triticum aestivum; (b) saprophytic growth of the four phytopathogenic fungi Fusarilon oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL), Fusarium culniortim (FC), Sclerotinia minor (SM) and Botrytis cinerea (BQ; (c) influence of soil amendment with DOR on the three plant-soilborne pathogen systems, L esculentum-FOL, T aestivum-FC, L. sativa-SM, and the two plant-foliar pathogen systems, L. esculentum-BC and L. sativa-BC. Residues resulted phytotoxic, both in laboratory and greenhouse bioassays, for all plant species {{in relation to their}} concentrations. L. sativum and L. sativa were the most sensitive species to the residues, followed by L. esculentum and T aestivum.

40|$|We have {{measured}} {{shifts in}} the isotopic a bundances of Gd and <b>Sm</b> in <b>soils</b> from the Apollo 17 deep drill stem and calculated the neutron fluence from these measurements. The measurements show two well defined regions of nearly constant fluence: (1) a thick deep section with a very large neutron fluence, and (2) a thinner shallow region with a small fluence. This depth dependence is most plausibly described by a model of rapid accumulation in the last 100 – 200 m. y., the layered structure reflecting accumulations of isotopically homogeneous source material. This interpretation is compatible {{with a variety of}} other characteristics of the soils, including the spallation produced 126 Xe normalized to target element abundances. An alternative model of deposition, followed by irradiation without mixing, followed by shallow mixing will quantitatively describe the data. The model yields an age of 1. 25 AE for the bottom of the drill stem. This model was rejected because of the implausible requirement that the soils from the drill stem be accumulated from a source of unirradiated material. The uniformity of various properties of soils provides criteria for defining major stratigraphic intervals in the drill stem which differ from those identified by the Preliminary Examination Team. Neutron fluences measured on shallow and deep soils from all lunar landing sites have been normalized to irradiation in an arbitrary standard chemical environment. We infer from histograms of the normalized fluences that there is a distinct difference in neutron fluence between shallow and deep samples which implies a general vertical stratification of neutron fluence in the lunar regolith. The regolith can be divided into three vertical regions: (1) a well mixed surface layer, ∼ 100 g cm^(− 2) thick, with an average fluence of 2. 3 × 10 ^(16) n cm^(− 2), (2) a poorly mixed zone extending from 100 g cm^(− 2) to at least 500 g cm^(− 2) with an average fluence of 3. 5 × 10 ^(16) n cm^(− 2), and (3) a deep layer of lightly irradiated materials (< 10 ^(16) n cm^(− 2)). Analysis of this stratification, using a vertical mixing model, indicates that the probability of mixing to several hundred g cm^(− 2) is comparable to the probability of mixing to several kg cm^(− 2). This is in contrast to the depth-cratering rate models which have been inferred from crater size frequency distributions using a power law. Alternatively, this discrepancy can be resolved if the true ^(157) Gd capture rate is 1 / 3 of the value calculated by Lingenfelteret al. (1972). The most plausible interpretation is that vertical mixing models are not an adequate description of relatively rare deep cratering events which result in significant lateral heterogeneity and addition of unirradiated material to the lunar surface. ...|$|R

The five treatments included sole millet (SM), sole leucaena (SL) planted in double rows to form hedges with an alley width of 2. 8 m, and alley cropping treatments LM 5, LM 6 and LM 6 P with alley widths of 2. 8, 3. 3 and 3. 3 m, respectively. Millet rows within the alleys were spaced at 47 cm, giving five rows in LM 5 and six rows in both LM 6 and LM 6 P. LM 6 P differed from LM 6 in that a vertical polythene barrier separated the root systems of leucaena and millet {{to a depth of}} 50 cm. Light interception, wind speed, saturation deficit and air, soil and leaf temperatures were monitored during the 1986 and 1987 rainy seasons in treatments SM, SL and LM 5. This paper describes the experimental design and instrumentation and presents representative diurnal time courses illustrating the nature of the microclimatic changes associated with alley cropping. These indicate that alley cropping altered the microclimate experienced by millet to an extent which depended on its proximity to the hedge, hedge shape and the relative size of the two components.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify which physical properties impact the thermal resistivity dry-out curve (TRDC) of natural sandy soils. The TRDC is a relationship between soil thermal resistivity and degree of wetness (e. g., volumetric water content, gravimetric water content, or degree of saturation). TRDCs of 13 sandy soils were investigated using modified hanging column tests. The tests were also used to investigate co-effects of the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC), which represents the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soil. The physical properties evaluated in this research included: (1) degree of saturation, (2) soil particle size (D 10 and D 50), (3) fines content, (4) soil type, (5) soil density (?dmax, emax, and emin) and gradation (Cu), (6) quartz content, and (7) particle shape (sphericity and roundness). In the TRDCs, three analysis points?thermal resistivity (?) at the fully dried condition, critical degree of saturation, and fully saturated condition?were selected for analysis. Correlations between the three points of interest on the TRDC and the physical properties were supported with high-resolution images obtained by synchrotron X-ray computed tomography (CT) and statistical analysis, including, ANOVA and stepwise regression. Results included the significant effects of the measured soil physical parameters on the TRDC in addition to the well-recognized parameter of degree of saturation as reported in the literature. Impacts of degree of saturation on the TRDC were related to thermal resistivity of three phases of soil systems (?solid, ?liquid, and ?air). Due to high ?air, the highest ?soil was observed at the fully dried condition. As degree of saturation increases, thin films and liquid bridges among soil particles are formed, resulting in a rapid decrease in thermal resistivity. Near the critical degree of saturation of a TRDC, which is located near the knee point of the SWCC where moisture exists as adsorbed films (McQueen and Miller, 1977), changes in ?soil are more rapid. After liquid bridges form, ?soil decreases gradually as degree of saturation increases. The lowest ?soil was measured at the saturated condition. Soil thermal resistivity also decreased with increase in particle size as evaluated by D 10 and D 50. This was primarily related to size and thermal resistivity of the solid phase. In high-resolution images, for example, larger solid particles provide larger heat transfer paths, while smaller solid particles (e. g., silt-sized) consist of smaller heat transfer paths with a more tortuous void structure. Consequently, ?soil was affected by particle size as related to the thermal resistivity of the solid and void phases in addition to the tortuosity of the matrix. In contrast, ?soil increased with increasing fines content. Reasons for the effect of fines were similar to those of particle size. At a constant void ratio, soil that included higher fines content, such as <b>SM</b> <b>soils,</b> had relatively small solid particles with tortuous voids compared with SP or SW soils, which do not include significant fines content. Smaller solid particles and tortuous voids led to a decrease in ?soil. In the modified hanging column test and ANOVA, thermal resistivity values of the 13 sandy soils were unaffected by the type of sandy soil regardless of the point of comparison. Parallel with laboratory tests, statistical analyses indicate that slight differences among soil types are not statistically significant regardless of the point of interest evaluated. At the dried, critical, and saturated condition, statistical significance by soil types per ANOVA were 0. 061, 0. 174, and 0. 268. Therefore, a larger database of soil that represents the full spectrum of gravel, silt, and clay is required to fully investigate the effect of soil type on the TRDC. The effect of soil density on TRDC was analyzed using four density parameters: (a) maximum dry unit weight (?dmax), (b) minimum void ratio (emin), (c) maximum void ratio (emax), and (d) coefficient of uniformity (Cu). Soil thermal resistivity decreased as ?dmax and Cu increased, while soil thermal resistivity increased with increasing emin and emax. In other words, ?soil decreased as soil density increased because of closer particle contacts and a reduction of the volume of air. On the other hand, ?soil increased with increase in emin and emax, which represent a decrease in soil density, due to less particle contacts and greater air volume. Because quartz is amongst the best heat conducting minerals that is common in natural soils (Winterkorn, 1962), influence of quartz content on the TRDC was analyzed. Soil thermal resistivity at each of the points of comparison (dry, critical, and saturated) decreased as quartz content increased. Effect of particle shape on TRDC was analyzed based on sphericity and roundness of particles. Higher thermal resistivity was measured for prismoidal particle shapes as compared to spherical particle shapes. Soil packing with prismoidal particle shape included more voids than soil packing with spherical particle shape. Roundness of the 13 specimens ranged between 1. 08 (well-rounded shape) and 1. 13 (rounded shape). Soil thermal resistivity increased slightly with increasing roundness because moisture adsorption is enhanced when particle shape changes from a well-rounded shape to a rounded shape (Likos and Jaafar, 2013). In stepwise regression, D 10 was the only significant factor in terms of ?sat, and D 50 was only significant factor in terms of ?dry. The regression model for ?sat and ?dry resulted in R 2 of 0. 245 (24. 5 %) and 0. 519 (51. 9 %), respectively. To investigate further statistical significance among the physical properties, a greater database of measurements for the TRDCs of sandy soils would be required. In comparing thermal resistivity with paramaters from the van Genuchten (VG) model, thermal resistivity increased slightly with the ? and n parameters, both of which are indicative of the shape of SWCC. However, one of the correlations?dry thermal resistivity to the ? parameter?decreased with the two SWCC parameters. Because of similar physical properties, however, increases in thermal resistivity were small. Therefore, additional tests with an expanded database of soils?including gravel, sand, silt, and clay?is recommended to more fully investigate the correlation between thermal resistivity and the VG parameters. Among the three points of analysis on the TRDC of the 13 sandy soils, ?soil at the fully dried condition was most affected by soil physical properties; to be specific, the dry thermal resistivity values ranged from about 150 ?C?cm/W to about 330 ?C?cm/W. Heat transfer in unsaturated soil systems directly depends on the matrix of solid particles and air voids, with large differences in resulting thermal resistivity. In contrast, thermal resistivity of the 13 specimens in terms of the physical properties changed only slightly at fully and partially saturated conditions (?soil ranged from about 40 ?C?cm/W to about 80 ?C?cm/W). These findings indicate that degree of saturation, particularly dry of the critical saturation, is the most significant factor for thermal resistivity of sandy soils with similar physical properties. A larger range of soil types with varying gravel content and percentage of coarse- and fine-sized sand is required to fully investigate the effect of soil physical properties on the TRDC at partially and fully saturated conditions...|$|R

This study aimed: (i) to analyze the pattern of changes in soil fauna community composition and characteristic of soil habitat based on the age increasing of cocoa plantation, and (ii) to identify taxa of soil fauna and factors of soil habitat which differentiate among the cocoa plantations. Sampling of soil, roots and soil fauna was conducted from cocoa plantation aged 4, 5, 7, 10, and 16 years. Difference in {{composition of}} the soil fauna community between ages of the cocoa plantation is significant. Profile of soil habitats was differ significantly between the cocoa plantations, except 5 and 7 years aged. A group of soil fauna has relatively limited in its movement, and sensitively to changes in temperature, soil acidity, and the availability of food and nitrogen are taxa differentiating between soil fauna communities. Soil physic-chemical conditions that affect metabolic activity, movement, and the availability of food for soil fauna is a  distinguishing factor of the characteristics of the soil habitat between different ages of smallholder cocoa plantations.
