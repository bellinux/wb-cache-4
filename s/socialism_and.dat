5|$|From {{his early}} student years, Dmowski {{was opposed to}} <b>socialism</b> <b>and</b> {{suspicious}} of federalism; he desired Polish independence and a strong Polish state, and saw <b>socialism</b> <b>and</b> conciliatory federalist policies as prioritizing an international idea over the national one. Over the years he became an influential European nationalist thinker.|$|E
5|$|According to Hobsbawm, the Fasci were a {{prime example}} of {{primitive}} agrarian movement that became modern by aligning itself with <b>socialism</b> <b>and</b> communism. Many of its leaders continued in the Socialist Party and continued the struggle for land rights and land reform once they were released. Despite the 1894 defeat, permanent movements were set up in some areas of Sicily using modern socialist models of organisation.|$|E

5|$|Before {{coming to}} Cambridge, Burhop had {{not engaged in}} {{political}} activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate generated by the suffering caused by the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} fascism in Europe. While he rejected his parents' faith in favour of rationalist science, he did not reject their values, especially that of compassion for others, and there was no estrangement between them. At Cambridge he embraced <b>socialism,</b> <b>and</b> believed that scientists had a moral responsibility to society, one that included fighting fascism.|$|E

5|$|In May 1923 {{he visited}} {{continental}} Europe, journeying to the museums in Lausanne, Bern and Zürich to study their prehistoric artefact collections; that year {{he became a}} member of the Royal Anthropological Institute. In 1925, the Institute offered him one of the only archaeological jobs then available in Britain, and he became their librarian, in doing so cementing connections with scholars across Europe. This job meant that he came into contact with many of Britain's archaeologists, of whom there were relatively few during the 1920s; he developed a great friendship with O. G. S. Crawford, the Archaeological Officer to the Ordnance Survey, influencing the latter's move toward <b>socialism</b> <b>and</b> Marxism.|$|E
5|$|The longest-serving non-royal head {{of state}} in the 20th and 21st centuries, Castro {{polarized}} world opinion.

Critics view him as a dictator whose administration oversaw human-rights abuses, the exodus {{of a large number of}} Cubans and the impoverishment of the country's economy. Castro was decorated with various international awards and significantly influenced various individuals and groups across the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} de-Stalinization in Czechoslovakia had begun under Antonín Novotný {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, but had progressed more slowly than in most other states of the Eastern Bloc. Following the lead of Nikita Khrushchev, Novotný proclaimed the {{completion}} of <b>socialism,</b> <b>and</b> the new constitution, accordingly, adopted the name Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The pace of change, however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalinist-era victims, such as those convicted in the Slánský trials, may have been considered as early as 1963, but {{did not take place}} until 1967.|$|E

5|$|Widely {{considered}} one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive personality cult within the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind Marxism–Leninism and thus a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive individual, Lenin is viewed by supporters as a champion of <b>socialism</b> <b>and</b> the working class, while critics on both the left and right emphasize his role as founder and leader of an authoritarian regime responsible for political repression and mass killings.|$|E
5|$|From January to October 1890, Morris serialised his novel, News from Nowhere, in Commonweal, {{resulting}} in improved circulation for the paper. In March 1891 {{it was published}} in book form, before being translated into French, Italian, and German by 1898 and becoming a classic among Europe's socialist community. Combining utopian <b>socialism</b> <b>and</b> soft science fiction, the book tells the tale of a contemporary socialist, William Guest, who falls asleep and awakes in the mid-20th century, discovering a future society based on common ownership and democratic control of the means of production. In this society there is no private property, no big cities, no authority, no monetary system, no divorce, no courts, no prisons, and no class systems; it was a depiction of Morris' ideal socialist society.|$|E
5|$|He also {{attended}} meetings of Marxists from different political factions, there arguing with the Mensheviks over various policies, particularly {{their support for}} the Provisional Government. In turn, they accused him of trying to plunge Russia into civil war. The Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries who dominated the Petrograd Soviet believed that Russia was insufficiently developed to transition to <b>socialism,</b> <b>and</b> thus supported the Provisional Government; Lenin disagreed, deeming them traitors to the socialist cause. Considering the government to be as equally imperialist as the Tsarist regime, he advocated immediate peace with Germany, rule by soviets, the nationalisation of industry and banks, and the state expropriation of land, all with the intention of pushing toward a socialist society. Over the coming months he campaigned for these policies, attending the meetings of the Bolshevik Central Committee, prolifically writing for Pravda, and giving public speeches in Petrograd aimed at converting workers, soldiers, sailors, and peasants to his cause.|$|E

5|$|Hitler's speech signalled his {{intention}} {{to rein in the}} SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. This would not prove to be simple, however, as the SA made up a large part of Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of the Great Depression, when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively– or even primarily– a working class phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist fervour. Many stormtroopers believed in the socialist promise of National <b>Socialism</b> <b>and</b> expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 the DF renamed {{itself the}} Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and {{underwent}} an internal reorganisation. However, {{the group was}} facing an internal schism between those (such as Hyndman), who argued for a parliamentary path toward <b>socialism,</b> <b>and</b> those (like Morris) who deemed the Houses of Parliament intrinsically corrupt and capitalist. Personal issues between Morris and Hyndman were exacerbated by their attitude to British foreign policy; Morris was staunchly anti-imperialist while Hyndman expressed patriotic sentiment encouraging some foreign intervention. The division {{between the two groups}} developed into open conflict, with the majority of activists sharing Morris' position. In December 1884 Morris and his supporters – most notably Ernest Belfort Bax and Edward Aveling – left the SDF; the first major schism of the British socialist movement.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{after two}} years in the largely rural diocese of Hereford, Henson {{returned}} to Durham as its bishop. The industrial north-east of England, including County Durham, was badly affected by an economic depression. Henson was opposed to strikes, trade unions and <b>socialism,</b> <b>and</b> for a time his forthright expression of his views made him unpopular in the diocese. His opinions about some Church matters changed radically during his career: at first a strong advocate of the Church of England's continued establishment as the country's official church, he came to believe that politicians could not be trusted to legislate properly on ecclesiastical matters, and he espoused the cause of disestablishment. He campaigned against efforts to introduce prohibition, exploitation of foreign workers by British companies, and fascist and Nazi aggression, and supported reform of the divorce laws, a controversial revision of the Book of Common Prayer and ecumenism.|$|E

5|$|The FPÖ is a {{descendant}} of the pan-German and national liberal camp (Lager) {{dating back to the}} Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas. During the interwar era, the national liberal camp (gathered in the Greater German People's Party) fought against the mutually-hostile Christian Social and Marxist camps in their struggles to structure the new republic according to their respective ideologies. After a short civil war, the Federal State of Austria, an authoritarian Christian Social dictatorship, was established in 1934. By 1938, with the Anschluss of Austria into Nazi Germany, the national liberal camp (which had always striven for an inclusion of Austria into a Greater Germany) had been swallowed whole by Austrian National <b>Socialism</b> <b>and</b> all other parties were eventually absorbed into Nazi totalitarianism. Both Socialists and Christian Socials were persecuted under the Nazi regime, and the national liberal camp was scarred after the war due to guilt by association with National Socialism.|$|E
5|$|The King and his {{advisers}} {{were concerned about the}} rise of <b>socialism</b> <b>and</b> the growing labour movement, which they mistakenly associated with republicanism. The socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were ready {{to come to terms with}} the monarchy if it took the first step. George adopted a more democratic, inclusive stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class—a dramatic change for the King, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. He cultivated friendly relations with moderate Labour party politicians and trade union officials. His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter.|$|E
