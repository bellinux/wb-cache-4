5|$|Newman's {{determination}} {{to make the}} promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available {{in all parts of}} the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were about one fifth of those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the <b>standing</b> <b>area)</b> was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.|$|E
50|$|After {{publication}} of the Taylor Report there was opposition to the all-seater recommendation from the Football Supporters Association, but no concerted campaign was mounted. With the Hillsborough disaster fresh in the memory, there was no appetite to oppose Taylor’s recommendations. The first serious campaign {{in support of the}} choice to stand was set up in 1999, initially with the aim of securing <b>standing</b> <b>areas</b> at Manchester City’s new stadium: SAFE - <b>Standing</b> <b>Areas</b> for Eastlands. With the backing of the Football Supporters Association the campaign then became, SAFE - <b>Standing</b> <b>Areas</b> for England.|$|R

5000|$|In 2011 the Scottish Premier League {{announced}} that their clubs {{would be given}} permission to introduce safe <b>standing</b> <b>areas</b> at their grounds. In 2012, Aston Villa announced they would be looking to install safe <b>standing</b> <b>areas</b> in Villa Park {{in time for the}} 2013-14 season. In that same year, Derby County became the first club from the Championship to support the introduction of safe <b>standing</b> <b>areas,</b> although the only terraced <b>standing</b> <b>areas</b> in the Championship and/or Barclays Premiership at that time could be found at London Road, home to Peterborough United. Peterborough United became the second Championship club to back the safe standing campaign through their CEO Bob Symns. Symns also signed the safe standing petition. Indeed, the club's mascot - Peter Burrow - took part in a video campaign promoting safe standing, with the video being shot at the AWD-Arena, home to Hannover 96 in Germany ...|$|R
5|$|Four columns {{were built}} through the {{existing}} Main Stand {{to support the}} Club Deck, which resulted in approximately 1,000 seats having a restricted view. After opening the Club Deck, Ibrox had a capacity of 44,500. When a new playing surface was installed in 1992, Rangers were able to add a further 1,300 seats {{to the front of}} three stands by lowering the pitch slightly. The only <b>standing</b> <b>area</b> of the ground, the enclosure of the Main Stand, was seated in 1994 to comply with the Taylor Report and UEFA regulations. The multi-coloured seats were replaced in 1995 with uniform blue seats. A further 1,200 seats was added in this process by reconfiguring passageways, giving a total capacity of 47,998.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the stands}} have more {{traditional}} names, but {{have since been}} renamed because of sponsorship deals. The JCT600 Stand is the ground's main stand, and is often called the latter by fans, but {{is also known as}} the Sunwin stand owing to the former sponsor. The Kop, was the former <b>standing</b> <b>area,</b> and its name was derived, like at many stadia across the country, from the Battle of Spion Kop. The East Stand, sponsored by Northern Commercials, is also named the Midland Road stand, because of the road {{on that side of the}} ground. The TL Dallas Stand is also known as the Bradford end, because it is nearest to the city centre.|$|E
5|$|After Bradford City won the Division Two {{championship}} in 1907–08, the club hurried through a reconstruction programme {{of the ground}} {{to prepare for the}} club's first season in Division One. Football architect Archibald Leitch was commissioned to design new terracing in the paddock—a <b>standing</b> <b>area</b> in front of the 5,300-seater main stand which was built in 1908—and build a Spion Kop at {{the north side of the}} ground and an 8,000-capacity stand at the Midland Road end opposite the main stand. Further work was performed to lower the railings, erect barriers, move the pitch and add extra turnstiles. The changing rooms were also moved, with a tunnel leading from the rooms underneath the Kop along the main stand side of the ground. The total project cost £9,958, and raised the capacity to 40,000. The work was not completed until midway through the 1908–09 season. The first match after work was finished took place on Christmas Day 1908, when 36,000fans saw City host Bristol City. The improvements allowed Bradford City to set their record attendance of 39,146 on 11 March 1911 against Burnley during the club's FA Cup winning run. It is the longest surviving attendance record at any league ground in the country.|$|E

5|$|Floodlights were {{installed}} {{at a cost}} of £12,000 in 1957. On 30 October they were switched on for the first time for a match against Everton to commemorate the 75-year anniversary of the Liverpool County Football Association. In 1963 the old Kemlyn Road stand was replaced by a cantilevered stand, built {{at a cost of}} £350,000, accommodating 6,700 spectators. Two years later alterations were made at the Anfield Road end, turning it into a larger covered <b>standing</b> <b>area</b> with refreshments under the structure. The biggest redevelopment came in 1973, when the old Main Stand was partially demolished and extended backwards with new roof. Simultaneously the concrete pylon floodlights were demolished with new lights installed along the rooflines of the Kemlyn Road and Main Stands. The new stand was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973. In the 1980s the paddock in front of the Main Stand was turned into seating, and in 1982 seats were introduced at the Anfield Road end. The Shankly Gates were erected in 1982, a tribute to former manager Bill Shankly; his widow Nessie unlocked {{them for the first time}} on 26 August 1982. Across the Shankly Gates are the words You'll Never Walk Alone, the title of the hit song by Gerry and the Pacemakers adopted by Liverpool fans as the club's anthem during Shankly's time as manager.|$|E

50|$|All-seater stadiums {{have been}} {{compulsory}} in the English Premiership {{since the start}} of the 1994-95 season as a result of the Taylor Report, which gave recommendations to improve stadium safety after the Hillsborough disaster. The initial plan, drawn up in 1990, had recommended that <b>standing</b> <b>areas</b> should be banned from stadiums in the upper two tiers of the league from 1994 onwards, while stadiums in the lower two tiers had until 1999 to meet these requirements. A review of the proposals in 1992 saw non-Premiership and second tier clubs retain the option to have <b>standing</b> <b>areas.</b> From time to time there are calls for Premiership stadiums to be allowed to have <b>standing</b> <b>areas,</b> but these have always been rejected.|$|R

25|$|Early 1990s: The western longterm car {{parking area}} was made or greatly enlarged, and {{aircraft}} <b>standing</b> <b>area</b> was enlarged, obliterating Etrop Green Farm (which was demolished in 1989) and its road-junction {{and trees and}} pond, and Fields Farm. Runger Lane was extended northwards to bypass this car park area and join Thorley Lane, which was rerouted to the north. A brick barn of Etrop Green Farm survived for a time fenced off among the car parking. The east end of this car parking area obliterated Woodhouse Farm.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the late}} eighties and early nineties the {{infrastructure}} {{at the ground}} was given a major overhaul, with the mini stand at the home end of the ground being redeveloped. In its place is now the family stand - a covered, all seater stand with board rooms, a club shop, restaurant and club bar. After this was completed attention turned to redevelopment of the 'popular side', which was fully covered and updated to modern-day standards. In 2000–01 the away end was also redeveloped with a new covered <b>standing</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, these luggage racks {{were always}} underutilised. Travellers {{preferred}} {{holding on to}} their bags where they were standing or sitting, as opposed to placing them on the luggage racks, probably due to convenience and fear of theft. Some commuters were also complaining that these racks took up critically needed space which could be occupied by other passengers which often filled the train. Furthermore, the service to Changi Airport was cancelled and replaced by a shuttle service to and from Tanah Merah station, dismissing {{the need to provide}} these racks for non-airport bound train services. Therefore, in 2003, trains with the luggage racks had them removed, and replaced with an empty <b>standing</b> <b>area,</b> with a dual purpose of serving as a wheelchair area.|$|E

25|$|Malmö IP has {{an overall}} {{capacity}} of 7,600 spectators, of which 3,900 are seated. It comprises five larger stands and one smaller stand. The main stand is the Southern Stand, which is all-seated and located {{along one of}} the long sides of the pitch. The Western and Eastern Stands, {{at opposite ends of}} the ground behind the two goals, are respectively terraced and seated. Opposite the Southern Stand are three inconsistent structures—from west to east, a stand with terracing, another with seats and a small <b>standing</b> <b>area</b> with a canopy. The dugouts, changing rooms and referees' facilities are located in the Southern Stand, which also features a small cafeteria. A sports hall called Tennishallen ("The tennis hall"), across the road from the Eastern Stand, is also considered part of the stadium.|$|E
25|$|Named after a {{hill that}} {{was the scene of}} a famous battle in the Second Boer War, the Spion Kop is built into a natural hill at the east end of the ground and houses the most vocal of Wednesday supporters. It is usually simply {{referred}} to by fans as The Kop. In 1914 concrete terracing was installed on the bank, which was further extended in 1927. The final expansion of the hill came in 1954. The stand remained open to the elements until a roof was added in 1986 after fans raised money to contribute to the cost. When the roof was added, the stand was 'squared' off to make it symmetrical so that the roof was used fully. Due to this, the Kop was extended, so the capacity rose from 16,000 to 22,000, which made it the biggest <b>standing</b> <b>area</b> in Europe at the time. After the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, the stand's blue fences were at first retained. However, for the 1989-90 season, the gates allowing egress to the pitch were painted white and kept open throughout all matches, including the Steel City derby on 21 November 1989. The Kop was {{the last part of the}} Wednesday ground to be converted to all-seater accommodation, the change finally coming in 1993 to comply with new FA Premier League regulations following the Taylor Report. The capacity was hence halved, but the Kop remains one of the largest single tier stands in Britain. A large concourse area was added in 2004, partially funded by the Owls Trust.|$|E

The Main Stand contains a clubhouse with a bar and catering facilities, club offices, changing rooms, a medical suite and a classroom. There is an additional bar under the St. Mary's Road End and food, concessions and merchandise areas are located {{both inside and outside the}} ground. Broadhurst Park also has a 3G pitch and two grass pitches adjacent to it as well as training and community facilities. The 3G pitch is used for home fixtures by F.C. United's Reserve and Women's teams.

500|$|Despite a club record 9–1 defeat to Colchester United on 30 December 1961, City came {{fifth in}} 1961–62, thanks to David Layne's 34leaguegoals—his total remains a club {{record for a}} season—but missed out on {{promotion}} by just one point. Layne left for Sheffield Wednesday and City finished 23rd the following season, forcing them to apply for re-election. In 1966, the club directors moved the pitch [...] closer to the main stand, creating enough space for them to add a new safe <b>standing</b> <b>area</b> on the Midland Road side of the ground and open all four stands {{for the first time}} since 1960. Attendances continued to drop and a new record low of 1,353 was set on 12 May 1966 against Wrexham. It prompted chairman Stafford Heginbotham to hold a crisis meeting in the city's St George's Hall to raise new funds and safeguard the future of the club. The club's indifferent form on the field continued, with another re-election and two narrow promotion failures, before promotion was gained in 1968–69. Only the previous season, City had had three managers, when Grenville Hair, who had replaced Willie Watson, died just two months into his reign, after he collapsed at the end of a training session.|$|E
