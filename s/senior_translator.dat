50|$|As China’s {{involvement}} {{in world affairs}} grew in the late 20th century, the CCP became sensitive to the negative connotations of the English word propaganda, and the commonly used Chinese term xuanchuan acquired pejorative connotations (MacKinnon 1997: 4).

40|$|In 1765 and 1767 respectively, German and English {{translations}} of Lomonosov’s Kratkii rossiiskii letopisets’ s rodosloviem (1760) hit the bookshelves. For {{the very first}} time the European reading public could find out how Russians saw their own history. Remarkably enough, both translations were made by youngsters, if not youths, i. e. the twenty-year old P. Ia. Shtelin and G. Forster, who was only 13 when his translation was published. Admittedly, both translators received help from their fathers, but their young age is still striking, especially from today’s point of view. In my contribution I will compare both translations with their source texts and examine, whether their modus operandi and (perceived) quality differ from the German and French {{translations of}} Lomonosov’s Drevniaia rossiiskaia istoriia. The latter appeared only shortly after Shtelin’s and Forster’s translations, but were made by <b>senior</b> <b>translators.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

During a two-day meeting prior to the field trip, twelve North American and eleven Soviet geologists presented papers, and participants discussed a variety of problems and ideas in Precambrian stratigraphy, sedimentology, tectonics, magmatism, industrial minerals, and metallogeny.

R. -Canada Joint Seminar, August 21 - 23, 1990, Duluth, MinnesotaThe {{geologic}} {{histories of}} the Canadian and Baltic Shields in North America and Europe, respectively, are broadly similar, and the topic was discussed during a conference and field trip involving North American and Russian participants {{in the late summer}} of 1990. During a two-day meeting prior to the field trip, twelve North American and eleven Soviet geologists presented papers, and participants discussed a variety of problems and ideas in Precambrian stratigraphy, sedimentology, tectonics, magmatism, industrial minerals, and metallogeny. Special emphasis was placed on problems of correlation. All papers were simultaneously interpreted by <b>Senior</b> <b>Translator</b> and Interpreter Grigori Sokolov of the Institute of Geology, Karelian Branch, U. S. S. R. Academy of Sciences, who accompanied the Russian delegation. His ability contributed greatly to the meeting's success. In addition to the speakers, thirty-eight geologists attended the conference: four Canadians, two Finns, and thirty-two Americans, including eight graduate students. As a result of the seminar and field trip, exciting and promising opportunities for continued cooperation were identified. Specific proposed activities include meetings, field excursions, short courses, joint publications, individual research-oriented exchanges, and joint projects. Involvement of young geologists was especially encouraged to promote long-term cooperative relationships. Opportunities also were identified for cooperation with other international projects, such as existing bilateral programs and the International Geological Correlation Program. It was mutually agreed that in 1991 - 1992, the Institute of Geology, Karelian Research Center, and the Kola Research Center of the USSR Academy of Sciences will host conferences and field trips on Proterozoic and Archean geology and metallogeny in the eastern Baltic shield. In 1991, the field program will emphasize Proterozoic geology, and in 1992, Archean geology. Other joint activities in the future will depend on the outcome of the 1991 and 1992 meetings. It was the intent of the organizers to bring this joint activity to the attention of officials involved in relevant international programs. Toward that end this proceedings volume has been published by the Minnesota Geological Survey. The body of this report consists of two parts; the first is a series of short papers that provide an overview of the Precambrian geology in the Great Lakes Region; the second part consists of a similar overview of {{the eastern part of the}} Baltic Shield.
