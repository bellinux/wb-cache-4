40|$|Project cost {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} criteria of success of project and is of high concern to those who are involved in the construction industry. However, studies show that rarely projects are complete within stipulated budget. This study is focusing on identification of significant causes affecting construction cost in MARA large projects. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire survey conducted among the personnel of Project Management Consultant (PMC). Data was analyzed with statistical tools to determine the rank of factors affecting construction cost. It is concluded that cash flow and financial difficulties faced by contractors, contractor's poor <b>site</b> management and <b>supervision,</b> inadequate contractor experience, shortage of site workers, incorrect planning and scheduling by contractors are most severe factors while changes in scope of project and frequent design changes are least affecting factors on construction cost. Spearman correlation analysis showed that incorrect planning and scheduling by contractor has strong positive relationship with contractor’s poor <b>site</b> management and <b>supervision,</b> inadequate experience of contractors has strong positive relationship with incorrect planning and scheduling; and contractor’s poor <b>site</b> management and <b>supervision,</b> changes in scope of project has strong positive relationship with frequent design changes; and vice versa. </p...|$|R

40|$|Concerns in the UK {{about the}} amount of {{methadone}} available 'on the street' and the growing problem of overdose deaths amongst opiate addicts and others, have led to the recent suggestion that supervised consumption of prescribed methadone may be an appropriate cautionary measure. This small study investigated the acceptability of supervised consumption of methadone amongst a treatment sample of opiate dependent clients attending an NHS drug treatment service in South London. Interviews were undertaken with 86 clients (from a sample of 100) asking details of their experience of supervised consumption of methadone, the effect of supervision on treatment and lifestyle, and opinions and preference for <b>site</b> of <b>supervision.</b> The results from this study indicate an overall positive response from this sample group of clients with the majority agreeing that supervised consumption reduced the amount of methadone 'on the street' and ensured compliance with the prescribed treatment. Convenience, and a preference coordinator for {{one or the other of}} the different formulations of methadone available, were identified as the most important reasons for indicating a preference for <b>site</b> of <b>supervision.</b> Further study is now required to establish the contribution that supervised consumption could make to reducing diversion and improving methadone maintenance treatment in the UK...|$|R
