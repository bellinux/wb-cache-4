Rather than {{suggesting}} the Green Party becomes a little more like the conventional top down political parties, Jonathon could <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more personal leadership. Last year he took 42 flight clocking up air miles to go to meetings to tell people to cut CO2. I am calling on Jonathon to use video conferencing a little more and to fly a little less.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, the {{underlying}} idea of Bruns has not proved viable (there were needs for refraction observations near the astronomical horizon, which—as Julius Bauschinger could <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> later—in principle {{can not be}} obtained with the required accuracy). On the other hand, the progress in the direct measurement of atmospheric data (weather balloon ascents) has since made the painstaking accuracy of this data from refraction observations unnecessary. In the time between PhD and habilitation Hausdorff completed the yearlong-volunteer military requirement and worked for two years as a human computer at the observatory in Leipzig.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the evidence about the waitoreke is from sightings. However some alleged physical evidence does exist. Several unidentified tracks have been found. They were described as being a few inches long and showing webbing. Otter footprints <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> webbing but beaver footprints show full webbing. In 1868 Julius von Haast obtained an alleged waitoreke pelt. It was in very bad condition and was not conclusively identified.

500|$|The {{character}} of Phoebe Green was {{considered as a}} recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance. Chris Carter explained the character's origins, saying [...] "I thought {{it was interesting to}} <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of Mulder's history by bringing an old girlfriend back. I've always wanted to do a Scotland Yard detective who was a woman. I also thought it was an interesting chance to use Amanda Pays and make a villainess of her". Executive producer Robert Goodwin felt that the episode [...] "was a hard one. Any kind of a fire stunt is a major undertaking, because it involves so many overlapping things. It was a major feat, a real logical and creative feat, because you wanted it to look good".|$|E

500|$|After he {{had been}} on the show for one season, Akinnuoye-Agbaje felt uncomfortable living in Hawaii and wanted to return to his {{residence}} in London, England. He discussed Mr. Eko's departure with Lindelof and Cuse, and the three decided the character would die somewhere in the first six episodes of the third season. They also found a [...] "shocking and emotional death" [...] would {{be the best way to}} write the character off the show. Akinnuoye-Agbaje felt Eko's death in [...] "The Cost of Living" [...] made the character [...] "complete", commenting: [...] "The Cost of Living" [...] was [...] "such a well-written episode that I knew I would be able to sew him up in a season", although Cuse later said he would have preferred the character to remain on the <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer. In 2008, Cuse and Lindelof made hints there were possibilities of the character's returning. However, despite Akinnuoye-Agbaje's wishes to return for the sixth season, the producers stated he would not be returning. The actor was eventually offered a guest role in the series finale, but turned it down due to salary disagreements.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the film}} was not without its detractors. Richard Roeper gave the film a C+, saying [...] "This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets." [...] Stephen Whitty of Newark Star-Ledger gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and said [...] "The artwork is accomplished, and intricate. The G-rating is genuine, without any gross-out gags. And there's none of the usual winks to the adults with tired, pop-culture references." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote [...] "Both the {{originality}} and stirring emotional complexity of Monsters, Inc., with its exquisitely painful and touching parallels with the human world, are missing." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and said [...] "This {{is not a bad}} movie, and to small children {{it will be a very}} good one, but it's closer to average than one would wish from the company that gave us Up, WALL-E, The Incredibles, and the Toy Story series." [...] Rene Rodriguez of Miami Herald gave the film two stars out of five and wrote that it [...] "feels half-hearted and lazy, like they weren't even trying. At least <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> effort, guys." ...|$|E
500|$|People writer Chuck Arnold {{wrote that}} Spears [...] "never really hit her old stride [...] {{there was a}} lot more {{strutting}} than real choreographic feats from [...] ". Jeff Montgomery of MTV both praised and dismissed Spears's performance saying, [...] "Yes, welcome to Britney's Circus, a big, huge, loud, funny, nonsensical three-ring affair... She looks great in her myriad of outfits, and she can still move with the best of them. [...] It's just, well, she's almost lost in the sheer hugeness of the production around her". Jane Stevenson of Toronto Sun gave Spears's performance three out of five stars stating there was [...] "so much was going on– there were also martial artists, bicyclists, etc.– there was no time to really assess Spears other than to note that she looked great. [...] She could lip-synch the words (one can assume) and strut around the stage well enough, but there was little in the way of genuine passion, joy, or excitement on her part". The Hollywood Reporters Craig Rosen claimed that [...] "in the end, Britney and company delivered an entertaining spectacle, but one couldn't help but wish that she would strip it all down and <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more of herself". Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times summed up all the reviews by stating, [...] "When Britney, touring behind her new Circus album, plays the Times Forum, there will be as many people rooting for her success as her failure. [...] But in the end, we're all envious and thankful, jealous and applauding. We like them/us and hate them/us for the very same reasons".|$|E

500|$|I Am... World Tour was produced, directed, {{and edited}} by Beyoncé {{for her own}} {{production}} company Parkwood Pictures. It contains tour footage from 108 shows {{that took place in}} 78 cities, 32 countries, and 6 continents in the presence of 1.1 million fans around the world. The show is a combination of performance clips from the tour, as well as backstage moments. I Am... World Tour also serves as the directorial debut for Beyoncé. On this occasion, she confessed that {{it was a lot of}} work for her. Nevertheless, she was very happy and eager for her fans to see her DVD directed by herself. She explained, [...] "I'm so excited – this is my directorial debut. I am just thrilled that my fans are going to be in the theatre with me and I can't wait for everyone to see it. It took me nine months to edit because I wanted to <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of each show, each performance on tour, and it was 116 shows, so you can only imagine how much work it was, [...] it was worth it." [...] At the New York City screening of the DVD, Beyoncé further explained that she was completely [...] "hands-on", deciding which moments made the final cut and which ones wound up on the cutting-room floor, stating, [...] "It was hard work. I learned so much. I have a new respect for directors and I think I would like to do more of it." [...] Some of the behind-the-scenes footage were shot by Beyoncé on her laptop. The DVD captures concert footage from cities in Europe, Asia, South America, and the United States, all edited into one concert. However, I Am... World Tour was significantly recorded at London's larger O2 Arena, a few months after the I Am... Yours concert. A live CD of the concert, a behind-the-scenes documentary of her life along the tour and a 20-page book of exclusive photos are all included in the package. According to a press release, [...] "it is meant to create the ne plus ultra Knowles concert experience, seen from her perspective".|$|E
2500|$|While {{the central}} concept behind Buffy was [...] "high {{school as a}} horror movie" [...] in small-town America, co-creators David Greenwalt and Whedon were looking to make Angel into a {{different}} [...] "gritty, urban show." [...] Whedon explained, [...] "We wanted a much darker show, darker in tone. It's set in Los Angeles {{because there are a}} lot of demons in L.A. and a wealth of stories to be told. We also wanted to take the <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> older and have the characters deal with demons in a much different way. Buffy is always the underdog trying to save the world, but Angel is looking for redemption. It's those two things that creatively make the shows different." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{he has been}} criticized for being anti-Israeli and {{supporting}} Palestinian radicalism. [...] "Is it wrong to ask of reporters in a country that {{is in the midst of}} a difficult war to <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more empathy for their people and their country?" [...] asked Amnon Dankner of the Maariv newspaper. Ben-Dror Yemini, the editor of the opinion page of Maariv, called Levy one of the [...] "propagandists for the Hamas". Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, wrote [...] " [...] the current Israeli heroes , from whom the Palestinians garner support for their ways, [...] Gideon Levy...." [...] In 2008, Arutz Sheva reported that Levy's article about the Jerusalem bulldozer attack was translated into Arabic for a Hamas website. In 2006, Gideon Ezra, Israel's former deputy Minister of Internal Security, suggested that the General Security Services should monitor Levy as a borderline security risk.|$|E

2500|$|The BBC {{commissioned}} the fourteen-episode seventh series on 8 June 2011. [...] "The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe" [...] was executive produced by Steven Moffat, Piers Wenger and Caroline Skinner. Beth Willis left the BBC and {{stepped down as}} executive producer after series 6 and Wenger also departed following the Christmas special, leaving Moffat and Skinner as executive producers for series 7. Marcus Wilson remained as series producer, with Denise Paul producing [...] "The Bells of Saint John", [...] "The Rings of Akhaten", [...] "Nightmare in Silver" [...] and [...] "The Name of the Doctor". Production of Doctor Who relocated to the new Roath Lock studios in Cardiff midway through production of the series on 12 March 2012; the first episode to be filmed there is the Christmas special in Block Four, with the debut of Coleman's character; however {{it was reported that}} a later episode written by Neil Cross was the first Coleman filmed.

2500|$|... "Attack" [...] was {{generally}} acclaimed by music critics. Alternative Addiction {{commented that the}} song [...] "soars sonically with processing mixed and forceful vocals." [...] Alternative Addiction also ranked the song at number 11 on the Top 50 Songs of 2005. Jim Campbell of Playback wrote that [...] "the standout tracks (“Attack,” “A Beautiful Lie,” “The Kill”) all exude the same strong elements: interesting lyrics, sweeping vocals, and a pulsing rhythm section. They all display a remarkable amount of musical maturity and charisma." [...] Mike Horvath of The Sheaf praised the keyboard effects and guitar distortions of the song, and Stuff listed the song {{as one of the}} top tracks from the album. Landon Christensen from Davis Enterprise felt that the song [...] "is pretty catchy, with a cool keyboard pattern and Leto's impressive vocals." [...] Jonathan Love of The Decatur Daily wrote that [...] "Attack" [...] "is an expression of rebirth featuring energetic keyboards, abrasive guitars and addictive vocals, which range from a pain-stricken wail to an intimate whisper." [...] Jason Silverstein from The Buffalo News felt that [...] "songs like 'The Kill,' 'Attack' and 'The Fantasy' <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of the old school sound, and also how the new sound should have worked." [...] Connie Phillips from Blogcritics commented that the song [...] "is a digital extravaganza of synthesizers which gives way to Leto's powerful vocals. Though he occasionally moves to the screaming that is ever present in today's heavy music, he doesn't cheat on the vocals. For the most part, it is very melodic and his voice is commanding. What he is delivering with that voice is potent as well. The lyrics are intricate and nearly poetic. This song is a driven expression of endings and new beginnings. The deep seated emotions cross both sides of the spectrum, rage filled and mournful." [...] Zone placed [...] "Attack" [...] at number 52 on the 210 Most Played Songs of the 2000s.|$|E
