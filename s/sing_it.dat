5|$|The {{yellowhammer}} is a bird of dry open country, preferably with a {{range of}} vegetation types and some trees from which to <b>sing.</b> <b>It</b> is absent from urban areas, forests and wetlands. Probably originally found at forest edges and large clearing, it has benefited from traditional agriculture, which created extensive open areas with hedges and clumps of trees.|$|E
5|$|We {{went into}} the booth to record the song. She {{originally}} {{wanted to do a}} Mike Skinner thing, rapping the verse and singing the chorus. But I asked her to <b>sing</b> <b>it</b> all, and she just made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E
5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to <b>sing</b> <b>it</b> like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E

5000|$|On Duran Duran's {{episode of}} Behind the Music, Reed {{admitted}} that their version {{might be better}} than his original version, saying, [...] "I think Duran Duran's version of 'Perfect Day' is possibly the best rerecording of a song of mine. I'm not sure that I <b>sang</b> <b>it</b> as well as Simon Bon <b>sang</b> <b>it.</b> I think he <b>sings</b> <b>it</b> better than I did. If I could've <b>sung</b> <b>it</b> the way he did, I would've. It wasn't from lack of trying. They recorded it the way I meant record it, which is a real big thrill for me, so thank you, Duran Duran." ...|$|R

The British and Irish Lions players were shown the words of The Power of Four on the Saturday before their first game and it was expected that they would know the words by the time they had arrived in New Zealand. However it was mentioned by a British and Irish Lions spokesman that the players were under no obligation to <b>sing</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tapp {{is forced}} to move further into the asylum, where he is {{captured}} by Pighead and {{is placed in the}} Shotgun Collar, which is later used in Saw III. Still in the trap, Tapp finds a second victim who is being held by Jigsaw. The victim, Jennings Foster, blames Tapp for being in his trap and thus harbors hatred for him. Tapp finds Jennings in a Pendulum Trap similar to the one used in Saw V. Tapp releases Jennings, who quickly runs away, believing that Tapp would get him killed if he stayed with him. Tapp moves on to find the next victim left behind by Jigsaw. He traverses the asylum and is led to the grave of his former partner Detective Steven <b>Sing.</b> <b>It</b> is there that Tapp discovers that Jigsaw has captured Melissa Sing, Detective Sing's widow. She has become a neglectful parent and is convinced that it is Tapp's fault that her husband was killed. Melissa is found in an Iron Maiden-esque Trap with spinning blades that will mangle her body should the device close on her. Jigsaw informs her that Tapp did not call for backup when searching Jigsaw's lair and that every one of the traps there could have been easily avoided by using standard police procedure, which makes Tapp responsible for his partner's death. Tapp saves Melissa. She says Jigsaw gave her the option to leave Tapp, so she quickly runs away.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} the sixth century, Pope Gregory the Great notes that there were {{differences}} {{in the way in}} which eastern and western churches sang Kyrie.

5000|$|McCartney also said: [...] "Ringo {{always used}} to do a song in the show. Back then he had 'Boys'. It was a little {{embarrassing}} because it went, 'I'm talking about boys - yeah, yeah - boys'. It was a Shirelles hit and they were girls <b>singing</b> <b>it,</b> but we never thought we should call it Girls, just because Ringo was a boy. We just <b>sang</b> <b>it</b> the way they'd <b>sung</b> <b>it</b> and never considered any implications." [...] (Paul McCartney. From Anthology.) ...|$|R

25|$|The {{band had}} been {{listening}} to Martha Wainwright's Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole during the sessions and were fans of it.

25|$|Gershwin's all-black opera {{was also}} unpopular with some celebrated black artists. Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was to see that it was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I <b>sing</b> <b>it</b> or not, it was still going to be there.|$|E

25|$|The prize contest begins. Beckmesser {{attempts}} {{to sing the}} verses that he had obtained from Sachs. However, he garbles the words (Morgen ich leuchte) and fails to fit them to an appropriate melody, and ends up singing so clumsily that the crowd laughs him off. Before storming off in anger, he yells that the song was not even his: Hans Sachs tricked him into singing it. The crowd is confused. How could the great Hans Sachs have written such a bad song? Sachs tells them that the song is not his own, and also {{that it is in}} fact a beautiful song which the masters will love when they hear it sung correctly. To prove this, he calls a witness: Walther. The people are so curious about the song (correctly worded as Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein) that they allow Walther to <b>sing</b> <b>it,</b> and everyone is won over in spite of its novelty.|$|E
25|$|Like his renowned British tenor {{predecessors}} Sims Reeves and Edward Lloyd, Coates had a famously protective wife. Moore {{refers to}} Coates' home life as serene, with an adorable spouse, sons and daughters; but he thought, despite Coates's good humour, {{he was not}} a happy person because he {{was too much of a}} worrier. Coates developed financial headaches, too. He wasted a good deal of money in a legal case that he launched against the Performing Right Society, in which he argued that he should not have to pay a royalty to perform music in public which had been brought to him in manuscript, and which therefore, by agreeing to <b>sing</b> <b>it,</b> Coates had encouraged the publishers to publish. He lost the case, and it preyed on his mind and finances for long after, though he refused offers of financial support from other singers. In his last years he thought of going back on the stage and started to slim, but he was seized with anaemia and became permanently confined to bed, frustrated at being unable to assist his country as the Second World War took hold. In July 1940, Gerald Moore presented a half-hour broadcast in tribute to their work together, and received a last letter from him in friendship and gratitude.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{loved that}} song. It was {{actually}} Rick Rubin's suggestion. We both loved that song {{and we both}} {{thought it would be}} great for Weezer, and for my voice, and it’d be great to do like a rock version of it with more of an alternative aesthetic. And you know, just the way I would <b>sing</b> <b>it</b> versus in the way Toni Braxton would <b>sing</b> <b>it.</b> And I love the way it came out, and I think probably the rest of the band really does not like it, and that’s probably why it didn’t make our fifth record, in 2005 when we were recording it." ...|$|E
