The valleys of the Red and Minnesota Rivers {{lay in the}} beds of Glacial Lake Agassiz and its prehistoric outlet Glacial River Warren; the lands exposed when these bodies of water receded were flat plains between low uplands covered by prairie grasslands. At the Traverse Gap, only a mile (1.6 km) of land separated the Bois des Sioux River, a <b>source</b> <b>stream</b> of the Red (which flowed north to Hudson Bay) and the Little Minnesota River, a <b>source</b> <b>stream</b> of the Minnesota River (tributary to the Mississippi, which flowed south to the Gulf of Mexico). The valley floors and uplands of the watercourses along this gently graded route provided a natural thoroughfare to the south. The eyes of the colonists therefore turned to the new United States, both {{as a source of}} supplies and an (illegal) outlet for their furs.|$|E

With {{a large number of}} stream PEs (Processing Elements) implementing various stream analytic algorithms, running on a large-scale, distributed cluster of nodes, and collaboratively digesting several multi-modal <b>source</b> <b>streams</b> with vastly differing rates, prototyping a reference application on System S faces many challenges. Specifically, we focus on our experience in prototyping DAC (Disaster Assistance Claim monitoring), a reference application dealing with multi-modal stream analytic and monitoring. We describe three critical challenges: (1) How do we generate correlated, multi-modal <b>source</b> <b>streams</b> for DAC? (2) How do we design and implement a comprehensive stream application, like DAC, from many divergent stream analytic PEs? (3) How do we deploy DAC in light of <b>source</b> <b>streams</b> with extremely different rates? We report our experience in addressing these challenges, including modeling a disaster claim processing center to generate correlated <b>source</b> <b>streams,</b> constructing the PE flow graph, utilizing programming supports from System S, adopting parallelism, and exploiting resource-adaptive computation. 1...|$|R
2500|$|It is Shiva, however, {{among the}} major deities of the Hindu pantheon, who appears in the most widely known version of the avatarana story. Told and retold in the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and several Puranas, the story begins with a sage, Kapila, whose intense {{meditation}} has been disturbed by the sixty thousand sons of King Sagara. Livid at being disturbed, Kapila sears them with his angry gaze, reduces them to ashes, and dispatches them to the netherworld. Only {{the waters of the}} Ganges, then in heaven, can bring the dead sons their salvation. A descendant of these sons, King Bhagiratha, anxious to restore his ancestors, undertakes rigorous penance and is eventually granted the prize of Ganga's descent from heaven. However, since her turbulent force would also shatter the earth, Bhagiratha persuades Shiva in his abode on Mount Kailash to receive Ganga in the coils of his tangled hair and break her fall. Ganga descends, is tamed in Shiva's locks, and arrives in the Himalayas. She is then led by the waiting Bhagiratha down into the plains at Haridwar, across the plains first to the confluence with the Yamuna at Prayag and then to Varanasi, and eventually to Ganga Sagar, where she meets the ocean, sinks to the netherworld, and saves the sons of Sagara. In honour of Bhagirath's pivotal role in the avatarana, the <b>source</b> <b>stream</b> of the Ganges in the Himalayas is named Bhagirathi, (Sanskrit, [...] "of Bhagiratha").|$|E
