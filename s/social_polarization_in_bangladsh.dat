40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{considered}} that the integration process of both {{developed and developing}} countries with the global world affects the aspect of <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> these countries. Two main approaches which are {{different from each other}} exist in the related literature about the effects of globalization on the <b>social</b> <b>polarization.</b> The first approach, which is mostly supported by neo-liberal economists, claims that the globalization influences the <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> positively. The other approach suggests that the <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> increases <b>in</b> the economies together with the globalization process. With this study which was prepared in this scope, the effect of globalization process on the <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> was tried to be tested by cross-sectional analysis of the data of 2008 of twenty-seven EU member countries. As a result of the findings obtained in this study, it was concluded that the globalization process has a decreasing effect on the <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> these countries...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, Korean {{society has}} {{obviously}} trended toward polarization since the 1997 financial crisis. Mass-unemployment, decrease of real income and accumulation of income inequality {{by the financial}} crisis and the following economic reform has caused the economic base {{of the middle class}} to collapse. At present, such a collapse of the middle class results in the rapid growth of <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> Korea. Particularly, the <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> and the spatial phenomena related to it appear more definitely in Seoul, which is the largest metropolis as the capital city. In this context, this study focuses on how <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> is related to spatial polarization. It could be said, that <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> consists of not just occupation or income related matters but is made up of more comprehensive matters, including lifestyle, recognition and attitude of regional difference, public service and investment, educational environment and so on. This paper is broadly divided into two sections. The first section depicts the general economic situation after the financial crisis in South Korea.

40|$|This article investigates trends <b>in</b> segregation, <b>polarization</b> and {{inequality}} <b>in</b> Athens during the 1990 s, {{and focuses on}} what may seem a paradoxical coexistence of decreasing segregation with increasing <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> {{and inequality}}. To explain this coexistence, the article examines the distinction between <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> specific contexts and the dominant assumptions about <b>social</b> <b>polarization,</b> which derive from the global city thesis, {{and the structure of}} the city's housing market, which prevented the substantial wave of immigration during the 1990 s from intensifying segregation. Arguing for more context awareness, the article does not try to stress the specificity of the Athenian case, but, mainly, to reveal the context-dependent character of the dominant assumptions about segregation and <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> and, therefore, to show their limitations.

40|$|This paper proposes two {{original}} measures of socioeconomic <b>polarization,</b> <b>in</b> order to quantify phenomena {{that are not}} always taken into account by social inequality measures. Our approach is inspired by the literature on bivariate inequality (the concentration index) and univariate polarization. Like the concentration index, our <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> measures can be easily computed thanks to a "convenient" regression and decomposed into their determinants. Moreover changes <b>in</b> <b>polarization</b> can also be decomposed into their causes. The paper also provides an empirical illustration of our methods for the probability of reporting excellent or very good health, using cross-sectional data on French women. The findings suggest that after 65 years of age, <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> this probability decreases whereas social inequality remains stable. Consequently <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> conveys additional information to that contained in the concentration index. Copyright 2009 The Author.

40|$|We {{argue that}} <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> reduces the {{security}} of property and contract rights and, through this channel, reduces growth. The first hypothesis is supported by cross-country empirical evidence indicating that <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> the form of income inequality, land inequality, and ethnic tensions is inversely related to a commonly-used index of {{the security of}} contractual and property rights. In examining the second hypothesis, we restrict {{our attention to the}} highly contested role of inequality in income and wealth. The relationship between inequality and growth diminishes considerably when the security of property rights is controlled for in growth regressions. This and other evidence suggests that income inequality reduces growth through its effect on property rights, rather than through any of several competing channels that have been advanced in the literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} {{argues that}} the presence of multiple veto players (government decisionmakers) with polarized interests increases the credibility of sovereign commitments, but reduces the ability of governments to adjust policies in the event of exogenous shocks that jeopardize their ability to honor their commitments. In the case of sovereign lending, if the first effect prevails, countries would be regarded as more creditworthy; if the second, less. The authors address two issues. First, using measures of country creditworthiness, they ask whether the net effect of multiple veto players is positive or negative. Second, though, the authors go beyond the existing literature to argue that the net effect of multiple veto players depends onthe nature of <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> a country. In particular, they argue that political competition is fundamentally different in countries exhibiting ethnic <b>polarization</b> than <b>in</b> countries polarized according to income or wealth. The evidence supports the prediction that multiple veto players matter more when countries are more ethnically polarized, but less when income inequality is greater.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{processes}} of <b>social</b> <b>polarization,</b> an increasing gap between the rich and poor, in Jefferson County, Kentucky, to determine the spatial characteristics involved and to investigate useful methodological tools. I argue that <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> processes are evident in Jefferson County, and I attempt to describe and analyze the emerging spatial characteristics of <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> the study area. The study area comprises the thirteen market areas of Jefferson County, which were broken down into 3 socioeconomic regions based on the natural breaks of market area median household income. Each market area is analyzed to illustrate how these regions reflect the three economic classes of low, middle and high. Because these social economic regions exist, <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> may be occurring in Jefferson County, Kentucky. Principle components analysis, a factor analytic method, can create an index of component scores for the measurement of <b>social</b> <b>polarization.</b> For analysis, the thirteen market areas of Jefferson County, Kentucky, are used as cases. Based on a literature survey, four variables were found to have a direct association with an increase in income inequality. Three occupation variables represent the three economic classes. The fourth variable is median household income. The component scores can be used to measure <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> Jefferson County, Kentucky. One factor was extracted, having 73. 8 % of the variation, and a bar chart was created to illustrate the component scores. Most of the market areas fell in the middle area between + 1 and - 1. If these market areas increase or decrease in score thereby leaving the middle area to the extremes of greater than + 1 or less than - 1, then polarization with regard to vocation and income has taken place. A bivariate correlation analysis showed extremely high correlations between each test variable and between the component scores and the test variables. Further research is recommended to validate the study...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we use panel data on occupations, {{industries}} and inequality in Japan between the years 1985 to 2005 and analyse their change in global and nonglobal regions. Considering the <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> hypothesis {{from the global}} cities theories implying specific character of changes in such cities, our results show that growth of specific occupations and industries in Tokyo and Osaka was not faster than in other regions, {{that there is only}} partial support for the proposed casual relation between industrial and occupational change, and most importantly, that these changes in particular occupations and industries do not lead to higher growth of inequality in global regions. Consequently, {{it can be argued that}} <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> the terms of previous theories is not characteristic for global cities in Japan. Thus, income inequality is indeed growing and is relatively strongly affected by de-industrialization, yet it leads to greater inequalities in the middle stratum rather than bipolarization of the income groups. This leads us to conclude that both Tokyo and Osaka, while strongly engaging in the global economy, are still heavily influenced by, and reflect, the national markets rather than global economy which causes a relative lack of difference with other regions as well...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. There is an {{abundance}} of oversimplified labels about Turkey, and this thesis attempts, with a strong angle toward history and patterns, to look deeper into Turkish identity. It will be argued that Turkey’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, packaged for the Turks an identity to which they could subscribe. The various components of this initial identity will be distinguished. The nation and state of Turkey overlapped nearly perfectly in the republic’s early years, and the goal was for them to stay so, with Turkey being a pure nation-state in the true sense of the word, but a detachment has developed. This is Turkey’s identity crisis, more than any political or <b>social</b> <b>polarizations</b> <b>in</b> the country today. American ignorance of Turkey’s identity has encouraged Turkish anti-Americanism. The two countries are supposedly ‘faithful allies’ on the political level, but what is understood (or rather misunderstood) on the public level does much relational harm.

40|$|Housing {{has come}} to play an {{important}} role in demarcating the contours of <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> inner London, notably via the widening socio-spatial divide between an impoverished working class located in council housing estates and affluent home-owning gentrifiers. In mass media and policy discourses, the former are routinely represented as an unruly urban ‘underclass’, a representation that homogenizes council tenants and marginalizes their voices. This article aims to move beyond a narrow underclass perspective by providing an in-depth analysis of neighbourhood place images and social identity based on interviews with white working-class council tenants in the inner London Borough of Camden. Drawing on debates around social distinction and place, the article illustrates a complex set of neighbourhood images rooted in narratives of urban decline as well as notions of belonging and knowing people. The article examines these place images in relation to the longstanding status distinction between respectability and roughness, as well as ‘race’. In conclusion, the defensive and exclusionary elements of neighbourhood images are related to processes of social deprivation and insecurity that have affected working-class council tenants in Camden...|$|R
40|$|Research {{undertaken}} by the authors in New South Wales (NSW), Australia suggests that master-planned estates (MPEs) that contain some publicly accessible infrastructure – such as roads, parks, walkways, lakes and bush land – outnumber those that are gated.

We apply McKenzie’s (2003) work on the ‘fuzzy’ boundaries between the public and private realms to five case study MPEs in NSW that include publicly accessible infrastructure and outline some of the social, economic and legal implications for developers, local councils, estate residents and the general public of these fuzzy boundaries. The paper concludes with some suggestions of how the challenges facing MPEs that include publicly accessible infrastructure may be mitigated, {{while at the same time}} maintaining the benefits that accrue to residents of the estate and surrounding areas, developers and local councils through the provision of such infrastructure...|$|R

Autor obrađuje specifičan fenomen socijalne polarizacije u prostorno etnički mješovitim susjedstvima, te posljedice koje takva situacija ima na shvaćanje i upotrebu prostora. Kao rezultat nacionalnog poretka stvari, dominantnog epistemološkog polja kroz čije kategorije se percipira stvarnost, produciraju se etničke granice i naglašavaju razlike koje u stresnoj prostorno mješovitoj postkonfliktnoj okolini traže potvrdu u prostoru-teritoriju. Markiranje i kolonizacija teritorija od određene etničke grupe u ovakvim situacijama ima funkciju zaštite osobne sigurnosti i stabilizirajući identitarni mehanizam. Autor zaključuje da translacija socijalne na prostornu polarizaciju u uvjetima etničke heterogenosti ima za posljedicu društveni život grada s punktualnim značajkama, otoke socijalnog života između kojih se nalaze nedefinirani i nesigurni prostori. This {{paper is}} based on an ethnographic {{research}} conducted during the year 2001. and 2002. in the city of Vukovar. Several things make Vukovar an interesting example. First, it is the Croatian city most destroyed in the war and also the city that suffered the greatest number of casualties. Second, its pre-war ethnic structure was relatively heterogeneous. And third, this area was peacefully reintegrated into the Republic of Croatia. Author examines a specific phenomenon of <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> spatially mixed neighborhoods and its consequences on understanding and the use of urban space. As a result of national order of things, a dominant epistemological field through which social reality is perceived, ethnic borders are produced and cultural differences are emphasized. In a very stressful post conflict and spatially mixed environment these ethnic borders tends to establish themselves in a space-territory. In such circumstances creation of a territory (by marking and colonization processes) has two important functions: protection of a personal security and identity-stabilizing mechanism. Author concludes that the consequence of translation of <b>social</b> to spatial <b>polarization,</b> <b>in</b> condition of ethnic heterogeneity, is punctuational social life. In other words, in a city of Vukovar islands of social life are present and between these islands there are undefined and unsafe spaces...|$|R

The author connects the need to modernize the Russian economy with the task of doubling GDP, correcting structural imbalances, reducing the technological gap with the developed world, overcoming <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> income, fighting inflation and smoothing the growth of inter-regional contrasts. The aim of modernizing the Russian economy is to achieve high competitiveness of the national economy, which would put the Russian Federation in terms of living standards among the most developed countries, and would provide a decent position in the world. The fact that "breakthrough" sectors of the sixth technological structure cannot be the starting point of modernization is substantiated. The concept of national competitiveness is reviewed. The lack of a complete model of modernization in the world is highlighted. Two main areas in relation to the modernization of the Russian Federation are identified: modernization of the commodity sector, which should represent applied modernization based on the comparative advantages of the Russian economy; with respect to functionally interrelated industries (fuel and energy complex and the oil-gas) and upgrading of transport infrastructure, which is so effective because of unique transit facilities and prospects of Russia...|$|R
40|$|The {{spectacular}} {{growth of}} gated communities around Latin America's largest cities {{has been widely}} noted. In Buenos Aires, after the upgrade of the northern highway in the 1990 s, the number of gated communities along the road more than tripled, reaching 500 by the year 2001. Yet, the geographic distribution of these communities was uneven, with the majority concentrated in municipalities with {{the highest percentage of}} poor households. Why, given similar land prices, land availability, access to infrastructure and distance to the city's core, did developers build gated communities in the poorest municipalities? This article argues that the decentralization of planning controls contributed to these patterns of distribution. While wealthier municipalities used this prerogative to enforce tighter controls on land use, the less affluent ones relied on their capacity to modify planning codes to lure real estate developers. Unlike well-serviced municipalities, who perceived the gated communities' privatization of services as a potential danger to their fiscal tax base, the municipalities that lacked urban services in most of their territory saw gated communities as a fast and inexpensive way of increasing local economic activities in less productive lands. As a consequence, after decentralization of planning capacities, the development of gated communities clustered in less affluent municipalities, hence deepening the <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> these jurisdictions.

40|$|This {{research}} analyses how Venezuelans abroad {{engaged in}} political communication through Facebook {{during the presidential}} elections of October 2012. This question is anchor in three different contexts: political and <b>social</b> <b>polarization,</b> increment of Venezuelan immigration {{and the use of}} new media as a field of interaction. The study first looks at the theoretical ground that provides a platform for the research, then explains the theoretical concept of public sphere, participation, community and social movements under the notion of the network society. Furthermore, some contextual background of Venezuela is presented in order to frame the origins of the political and <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> the country. This research combines quantitative and qualitative research methods in order to analyse textual and visual data generated during the Venezuelan presidential election in the Facebook group 'Venezuelans abroad'. The large number of data collected offered a suitable material to outline topics of discussion, supporting material and sources of information through the quantitative approach. Meanwhile, the qualitative approach uses netnography design in order {{to make sense of the}} data collected in terms of political engagement. The study collected the data from a period of three days, consisting of the day before the presidential election, the day of election and the day after the election. The result of the analysis suggests that Venezuelans abroad used Facebook as a platform for campaigning the two main presidential candidates Hugo Chávez Frías and Henrique Capriles bypassing the rules of the electoral council. Due to the structural nature of communication in the new media, Venezuelans abroad could select their reliable sources of information and supporting material to generate their own content. Moreover, the close reading of the data suggests that Venezuelans abroad used Facebook to express their ideas, political interest and demands towards what they considered to be good or bad for the health of democracy, hence, Facebook represented the virtual space in which Venezuelans abroad reunited to produce their content, to debate, confront, affiliate and support other members of the group...|$|R

40|$|The rise of {{the left}} across much of South America in the {{aftermath}} of market reforms catalyzed a major divergence in regional party systems. In some countries, polarizing party systems emerged, marked by conflictual patterns of contestation between major political parties and the politicization of class cleavages in party competition. In other countries, integrative party systems consolidated, characterized by largely consensual patterns of competition and class cleavages that remain unexpressed in party competition. This variation in party systems represents a critical macropolitical legacy to emerge from the tumultuous recent decades and offers fruitful ground for developing and testing theory regarding the causes of political and <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> the younger democracies of the highly unequal developing world. Examining the cases of Venezuela, Brazil, and Chile, this dissertation develops an argument that centers on the avoidance or occurrence of "legitimacy crises": anti-systemic episodes involving protracted failures of governance and steep erosions of public confidence in state institutions. The presence or absence of legitimacy crisis decisively shaped factional contestation within the partisan left in each country, leading to party system divergence along two dimensions. Whether radical or moderate left coalitions consolidated entailed the establishment of conflictual or consensual patterns of contestation within party systems. Once in office, the radical and moderate left also pursued different strategies of political mobilization - mass-organizational in Venezuela and catchall in Brazil and Chile - that subsequently drove variation in the translation of class cleavages into party competition. The study relies on a variety of qualitative and quantitative data sources, including those gathered during 11 months of fieldwork in Venezuela, and utilizes both process-tracing and statistical methods (primarily genetic matching) to draw causal inferences. A concluding chapter shows that the argument can also explain variation in party systems in two other countries where the left has taken power (Bolivia and Uruguay), suggesting that the framework in the study might provide a broader model of macropolitical divergence in the region during the last decades...|$|R
5000|$|Soja uses Los Angeles as {{evidence}} that <b>social</b> inequalities and <b>polarizations</b> <b>in</b> American society have in fact been increasing, which partly due to globalization and economic restructuring. He describes the [...] "ethnic quilt" [...] of L.A., [...] "a heterogeneous mosaic of new and old ethnicities". In this, he discusses ethnic niches as well as segregated cityspace, the spatial or geographical concentration of ethnic groups in L.A. Many parts of Los Angeles have experienced rapid demographic transformations in recent decades. Some neighborhoods have been [...] "shifting from 80 percent white in 1965 to, in many areas, over 90 percent Latino today." [...] Soja concludes by stating that [...] "... Los Angeles {{remains one of the}} most segregated urban regions in the country." ...|$|R
40|$|Bots are, {{for many}} Web and social media users, {{the source of}} many {{dangerous}} attacks or the carrier of unwanted messages, such as spam. Nevertheless, crawlers and software agents are a precious tool for analysts, and they are continuously exe-cuted to collect data or to test distributed applications. How-ever, no one knows which is the real potential of a bot whose purpose is to control a community, to manipulate consensus, or to influence user behavior. It is commonly believed that the better an agent simulates human behavior in a social net-work, the more it can succeed to generate an impact in that community. We contribute {{to shed light on}} this issue through an online social experiment aimed to study to what extent a bot with no trust, no profile, and no aims to reproduce human behavior, can become popular and influential in a social me-dia. Results show that a basic social probing activity can be used to acquire social relevance on the network and that the so-acquired popularity can be effectively leveraged to drive users in their social connectivity choices. We also register that our bot activity unveiled hidden <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> patterns <b>in</b> the community and triggered an emotional response of indi-viduals that brings to light subtle privacy hazards perceived by the user base. ...|$|R
40|$|Most {{efforts to}} trace the effects of income {{inequality}} on growth have focused on redistribution. However, empirical investigation has not substantiated either the positive association of income inequality with redistribution or the negative association of redistribution with economic growth. The authors analyze the effects of inequality in the broader context of <b>social</b> <b>polarization.</b> They argue that <b>social</b> <b>polarization,</b> whether rooted <b>in</b> income inequality or in ethnic tension, makes large changes in current policies (including those guaranteeing the security of contract and property rights) more likely under {{a wide range of}} institutional arrangements. The resulting uncertainties in the policy and contractual environment hinder growth. They find strong empirical support for both parts of this argument. The policy implications of their argument are quite distinct from those of arguments that inequality reduces growth by increasing pressures for redistribution. If redistributive policies per se were to blame for the low growth resulting from inequality, governments that seek to mitigate income inequality must inevitably confront a tradeoff between equity and growth. If, on the other hand, the insecurity of property rights slows growth in unequal or otherwise polarized societies, governments that commit over the long run to particular redistributive policies incur less risk of slowing economic growth. Fiscal redistribution that reduces inequality may actually increase growth by reducing the risks of political uncertainty.

40|$|In this paper, {{evidence}} from Britain and the United States concerning <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> is compared. Two major {{approaches to the}} subject are identified: the first, most extensively developed in the United States, is focused upon occupational shifts and their impact upon the earnings paid to individuals; and the second, which has emerged in Britain, is focused upon households and all the types of work undertaken within them. These approaches and their differing implications for polarization [...] the first approach suggesting a 'disappearing middle' and the second approach a growing 'underclass' [...] are related to differing social and economic circumstances in Britain and the United States. Both approaches are applied to a household survey of the economically active in Southampton. The survey indicates that <b>social</b> <b>polarization</b> is a result both of sectoral shifts in the local economy and of changing household structures. A number of contrasts between labour-market influences upon <b>polarization</b> <b>in</b> the United States and Britain are highlighted. ...|$|R
