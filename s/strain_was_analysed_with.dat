As the agreement between currently available strain imaging modalities is unknown, three different modalities were compared. Twenty-seven CRT-candidates, prospectively {{included in the}} MARC study, underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and echocardiographic examination. Left ventricular (LV) circumferential <b>strain</b> <b>was</b> <b>analysed</b> <b>with</b> CMR tagging (CMR-TAG), CMR feature tracking (CMR-FT), and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE). Basic strain values and parameters of dyssynchrony and discoordination obtained with CMR-FT and STE were compared to CMR-TAG. Agreement of CMR-FT and CMR-TAG was overall fair, while agreement between STE and CMR-TAG was often poor. For both comparisons, agreement on discoordination parameters was highest, followed by dyssynchrony and basic strain parameters. For discoordination parameters, agreement on systolic stretch index was highest, with fair intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) (CMR-FT: 0. 58, STE: 0. 55). ICC of septal systolic rebound stretch (SRSsept) was poor (CMR-FT: 0. 41, STE: 0. 30). Internal stretch factor of septal and lateral wall (ISFsep-lat) showed fair ICC values (CMR-FT: 0. 53, STE: 0. 46), while the ICC of the total LV (ISFLV) was fair for CMR-FT (0. 55) and poor for STE (ICC: 0. 32). The CURE index had a fair ICC for both comparisons (CMR-FT: 0. 49, STE 0. 41). Although comparison of STE to CMR-TAG was limited by methodological differences, agreement between CMR-FT and CMR-TAG was overall higher compared to STE and CMR-TAG. CMR-FT is a potential clinical alternative for CMR-TAG and STE, especially in the detection of discoordination in CRT-candidate...|$|E

In contrast, oral administration of L. reuteri and L. brevis induced expression of the proinflammatory/Th 1 cytokines TNF-α, IL- 2 and/or IL- 1 β. Oral administration of these two strains and L. fermentum also significantly enhanced the IgG response against parenterally administered haptenated chicken gamma globulin (TNP-CGG). The five other strains did not show this adjuvanticity. L. reuteri induced relatively high levels of IgG 2 a compared to L. murines, a nonadjuving Lactobacillus strain. These findings imply that different Lactobacillus strains induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles and possess differential intrinsic adjuvanticity. This suggests that rational Lactobacillus strain selection provides a strategy to influence cytokine expression and thereby influence immune responses. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Lt...|$|R

MAb 2 D 9 reacted specifically by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation with the Ul 102 and GS isolates, and failed to react with Z 29 and the variant B strains Hashimoto and SF. In addition, Z 29, Hashimoto and SF gB had a lower M r than U 1102 and GS gB. MAb 2 D 9 also failed to react with the exanthem subitum isolate CV, {{included in this study}} as an as yet poorly characterized isolate. Consistent with this result, CV failed to react with the variant A-specific MAb to gp 82 - 105 and behaved as a variant B virus even with respect to the diagnostic HindII I endonuclease restriction cleavage site located in a fragment hybridizing to the pZVHI 4 probe.

At nucleotide levels, negatively or uncharged aa, e. g., aspartic and glutamic acid and glycine, which are encoded by the triplets GAN (guanine-adenosine-any nucleotide) or GGN are found more often in R 5 strains. Positively charged aa such as arginine and lysine encoded by AAR or AGR (CGN) (R means A or G) are seen more frequently in X 4 strains suggesting our hypothesis that a switch from R 5 to X 4 strains occurs via a G-to-A mutation. 1527 V 3 sequences from three independent data sets of X 4 and R 5 <b>strains</b> <b>were</b> <b>analysed</b> <b>with</b> respect to their triplet composition.

These findings also support our hypothesis that G-to-A mutations are leading to the co-receptor switch from R 5 to X 4 strains. Causative agents for G-to-A mutations are the deaminases APOBEC 3 F and APOBEC 3 G. We therefore hypothesize that these proteins are one driving force facilitating the appearance of X 4 variants.

METHODS: The population study was a random sample from the GAZEL cohort. Durations of exposure to selected biomechanical strains during subjects' working lifetime and potential confounders were assessed in 1996 by self-administered questionnaires. Data on LBP in the previous 12 months were collected in 2001. Relations between various dimensions of LBP and durations {{of exposure to the}} biomechanical <b>strains</b> <b>were</b> <b>analysed</b> <b>with</b> multivariate regression models. Polytomous models were built to determine whether some biomechanical <b>strains</b> <b>were</b> specifically associated with some types of LBP. RESULTS: <b>Analyses</b> <b>were</b> performed separately for men (n = 2218) and women (n = 383). Significant associations were observed (ORs reported are those for 20 years of exposure) between LBP and durations of driving and bending/twisting for men (OR 1. 24 and 1. 37 respectively); LBP for more than 30 days and duration of exposure to bending/twisting for men and women (OR 2. 20 and 2. 00 respectively) and duration of driving for women (OR 3. 15); LBP radiating to the leg and duration of driving for men (OR 1. 43) and bending/twisting for women (OR 1. 95); LBP radiating below the knee and duration of exposure to pulling/pushing/carrying for men (OR 1. 88). Bending/twisting in both men and women, and driving for women appeared to be stronger risk factors for LBP for more than 30 days. Pulling/pushing/carrying heavy loads appeared to be a risk factor specific for LBP radiating below the knee for men.

40|$|International audienceThe aeronautic and {{automotive}} {{industries have}} shown {{a renewed interest in}} TiAl based alloys. The main reasons for such an interest are their low density (~ 3, 8 g/cm 3), a good stiffness and a high strength for temperatures up to 750 °C. However, these alloys exhibit, in their polycrystalline form, a poor ductility at room temperature with widely scattered values. The aim of this study is therefore to characterise their mechanical behaviour with a multiscale methodology, coupling microstructure analysis and strain field measurements. This methodology employs orientation imaging microscopy as well as digital imaging correlation techniques with an intragranular step size of a few micrometers. Two chemical compositions (47 at. % Al and 48 at. % Al) and two processing routes (casting and powder metallurgy) are studied. Thus, four different types of final microstructures are considered, from fully lamellar Ti 3 Al (a 2) + TiAl (g) microstructure to bimodal ones composed of two-phase (a 2 +g) lamellar grains and monolithic g grains. Firstly, the microstructure is characterised crystallographically and morphologically. This allows the identification of a representative volume element (RVE) inside the analysed volume. Then, uniaxial mechanical tests are performed for each microstructure, and the <b>strain</b> fields <b>are</b> <b>analysed</b> <b>with</b> a multiscale approach, which determines the spatial distribution of the strain field heterogeneity with respect to the different microstructures...|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{prepared}} in the laboratories of the Max Planck Institute for Limnology in Plön (Germany). It {{is focused on}} bacteria-protozoan interactions and the underlying mechanisms of grazing-resistance in aquatic bacteria: phenotypic properties of aquatic bacteria {{with respect to their}} potential effect on bacterial vulnerability and survival in the presence of bacterivorous protists (such as heterotrophic nanoflagellates, HNF). Interactions were studied mainly as impact of the presence of predators on both single bacterial strains and bacterial communities, considering variations of phenotype, genotype and fitness in the first case, and variations in diversity, productivity and distributions {{in the second part of}} the work. Chemostat systems with bacteria and bacterivorous protists were used to enrich and isolate bacterial species which had a potentially reduced vulnerability towards grazers. These <b>strains</b> <b>were</b> <b>analysed</b> <b>with</b> respect to their anti-grazer phenotypic properties, phenotypic plasticity and regulating mechanisms in the expression of these properties. Bacterial communities composed by strain isolated with the same methodology were tested in chemostat systems to analyze the impact of predation by HNF and of inter-specific competition for resources on their diversity and on their genetic and phenotypic composition. One principal aim was to elucidate the diversity and effectiveness of the underlying mechanisms of grazing resistance in aquatic bacteria: cell-size and shape are important and well-documented features which determine bacterial vulnerability to grazers. However, other characters which might also impact upon the predator-prey interactions with protozoans were still poorly understood. Of particular interest was the question as to whether some of the resistance mechanisms found (e. g., morphology, toxins, exopolymers) can be induced by predator chemicals, or whether their development is mainly related to substrate supply and elimination of competitors by grazing. A cost-benefit analysis for selected polymorphic bacterial strains (with resistant and vulnerable phenotypes) should reveal further insight into the evolution and the ecological consequences of grazing-resistant bacteria. In the first part of the thesis it was studied the impact of grazing and substrate supply on the population size structure of a freshwater bacterial strain (Flectobacillus sp.) which showed a high morphological plasticity, with cell lengths in the range 2 - 40 µm, encompassing rods, curved cells and long filaments. Without grazers and with sufficient substrate supply bacteria grew mainly in form of free-living medium-sized rods (4 - 7 µm) with a smaller proportion of filaments. Batch grazing experiments with the bacterivorous flagellate Ochromonas sp. showed that cells 80 % filaments in the grazer treatments. These morphological differences did not seem to have a strong impact on the physiological capabilities as revealed from substrate uptake and utilisation measurements. Carbon starvation resulted in a low degree of morphological plasticity and a fast increase of small rods which were highly vulnerable to grazing. Dialysis bag experiments were used to test for chemical induction of bacterial morphological changes. They revealed that the excretion of organic substrates by flagellates stimulates bacterial growth. When these experiments were combined with continuous cultivation they gave strong evidence for chemical induction of resistant bacterial morphologies: The development of filamentous forms occurred even without direct contact with predators when bacteria were exposed for several generations to predator-released substances. The second part of the thesis was focused on HNF predation and competition for resources can effect on bacterial populations. The effects of limiting factors on ecological systems and their possibility to influence community’s structure and composition represent one of the most debated topics in modern ecology. The understanding of processes related to biological communities is extremely difficult, because of their extraordinary complexity. For these reasons, the most fruitful approaches have been the reduction of the complexity of the systems, and the development of related mathematical models. Because of their qualities, microbial communities are the most commonly used for these studies. Using carbon-limited chemostats with differing substrate input, the influence of system productivity on predator-prey interactions in classical artificial communities of planktonic bacteria and bacterivores, was examined for two different experiments. Analysing population dynamics, diversity and functional attributes of the mixed bacterial assemblages and of bacterivorous nanoflagellates it was assessed the relative importance of the classes of edible and inedible bacteria. In accordance with existing models on microbial predator-prey interactions, the relative importance of grazing-resistant prey increased with increasing productivity. With a detailed analysis on the morphology and functionality of bacterial cells it was possible to recognize different mechanisms of resistance along the productivity gradient. Performing a T-RFLP analysis of bacterial populations was noticed that predator-mediated increases in phenotypic diversity were not necessarily reflected in changes of the genetic diversity of our bacterial populations. Starting from the huge background from former studies and models on simple communities, this approach tries to clarify the validity of the most debated ecological theories about relations between prey-predator interactions, productivity of the system and biodiversity on larger scale.

For this reason, variability in ROI sizes might have been introduced between the two software analyses.|$|R
40|$|Perturbations {{in terms}} of small elastic {{deformations}} superimposed upon a given homogeneous <b>strain</b> <b>are</b> <b>analysed</b> within a boundary element framework. This {{is based on a}} recently-developed Green's function and boundary integral equations for non-linear incremental elastic deformations. Plane <b>strain</b> deformations <b>are</b> considered of an incompressible hyperelastic solid within the elliptic range. The proposed approach is shown to yield bifurcation loads and modes via a perturbative approach. Numerical treatment of the problem is detailed and applications to multilayers are shown. Relations between shear band formation and global instabilities are given evidence...|$|R
