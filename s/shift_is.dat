5|$|Half-Life: Blue <b>Shift</b> <b>is</b> an {{expansion}} pack for Valve Software's science fiction first-person shooter video game Half-Life. The game {{was developed by}} Gearbox Software with Valve Corporation and published by Sierra On-Line on June 12, 2001. Blue <b>Shift</b> <b>is</b> the second expansion for Half-Life, originally intended {{as part of a}} Dreamcast version of the original game. Although the Dreamcast port was later cancelled, the PC version continued development and was released as a standalone product. The game was released on Steam on August 24, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of this star showed the characteristic absorption line shift of a binary star system. This <b>shift</b> <b>is</b> created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a doppler shift in the wavelength of the line features. The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity {{of at least one}} of the stars even though they are unable to resolve the individual components.|$|E

Fundamentally, the problem with chemical shift referencing {{comes from the fact that}} chemical <b>shifts</b> <b>are</b> relative frequency measurements rather than absolute frequency measurements. Because of the historic problems with chemical shift referencing, chemical <b>shifts</b> <b>are</b> perhaps the most precisely measurable but the least accurately measured parameters in all of NMR spectroscopy.|$|R

5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar <b>shift,</b> <b>is</b> one of the {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It {{is a type of}} substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.|$|E
5|$|The main factor {{behind this}} <b>shift</b> <b>is</b> the high summer {{temperature}} difference between Central Asia and the Indian Ocean. This {{is accompanied by}} a seasonal excursion of the normally equatorial intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), a low-pressure belt of highly unstable weather, northward towards India. This system intensified to its present strength {{as a result of the}} Tibetan Plateau's uplift, which accompanied the Eocene–Oligocene transition event, a major episode of global cooling and aridification which occurred 34–49Ma.|$|E

5|$|As an {{expansion}} pack for Half-Life, Blue <b>Shift</b> <b>is</b> a first-person shooter. The overall gameplay of Blue Shift does not significantly differ {{from that of}} Half-Life: players are required to navigate through the game's levels, fight hostile non-player characters and solve a variety of puzzles to advance. The game continues Half-Lifes methods of an unbroken narrative. The player sees everything through the first person perspective of the protagonist and remains {{in control of the}} player character for almost all of the game. Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than cut scenes. Progress through the game's world is continuous; although the game is divided up into chapters, the only significant pauses are when the game needs to load the next part of an environment.|$|E
5|$|As with Gearbox's {{previous}} expansion pack , Blue Shift {{returns to}} the setting and events of the original game, but portrays the story {{through the eyes of}} another person. The protagonist in Blue <b>Shift</b> <b>is</b> a security guard, Barney Calhoun, employed by the Black Mesa Research Facility. After a scientific mishap causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens, Calhoun must fight his way to safety. The game received mostly positive reception. Many reviewers were critical of the short length of the game and the lack of new content, although the inclusion of a High Definition pack that upgraded the models and textures in both Blue Shift and the preceding Half-Life games was praised.|$|E
5|$|Love's Last <b>Shift</b> <b>is</b> today read {{mainly to}} gain a {{perspective}} on Vanbrugh's sequel The Relapse, which has by contrast remained a stage favourite. Modern scholars often endorse the criticism that was levelled at Love's Last Shift from the first, namely {{that it is a}} blatantly commercial combination of sex scenes and drawn-out sentimental reconciliations. Cibber's follow-up comedy Woman's Wit (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had no discernible theme; Cibber, not usually shy about any of his plays, even elided its name in the Apology. It was followed by the equally unsuccessful tragedy Xerxes (1699). Cibber reused parts of Woman's Wit for The School Boy (1702).|$|E

5|$|Blue <b>Shift</b> <b>is</b> set in {{the same}} {{location}} and time frame as that of Half-Life, taking place at a remote New Mexico laboratory called the Black Mesa Research Facility. In Half-Life, the player takes {{on the role of}} Gordon Freeman, a scientist involved in an accident that opens an inter-dimensional portal to the borderworld of Xen, allowing the alien creatures of Xen to attack the facility. The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal, ultimately traveling to Xen to do so. As in Opposing Force, Blue Shift shows the events of Half-Life {{from the perspective of a}} different protagonist. The player assumes the role of Barney Calhoun, a security guard working near the labs where the accident takes place. Calhoun is responsible for the preservation of equipment and materials and the welfare of research personnel, and after the accident turns Black Mesa into a warzone, he must work with Dr. Rosenberg, a high-ranking scientist involved in the experiment, to evacuate the facility.|$|E
5|$|The game, which largely {{follows the}} action RPG and hack and slash {{gameplay}} of previous {{games in the}} series, sees players alternate between the roles of Sora and Riku. Alternating between characters is done via the 'Drop' system. During gameplay, a Drop Gauge gradually depletes over time, though it can be replenished with items. When the gauge completely empties, control will switch to the other character, though players may also opt to drop manually at any time. Drop Points, which are earned by defeating enemies and completing optional objectives, can be spent on bonuses {{that can be used}} until the next time the character drops, such as a slower Drop Gauge or increased attack or defense. The game reuses the Command Deck system from Birth by Sleep, in which players can customize a deck filled with various actions, spells, and items that can be quickly selected. There are also several new elements added to the gameplay. Flowmotion allows players to move quickly about by performing actions such as bouncing off walls, grinding on rails and spinning around poles. Reality <b>Shift</b> <b>is</b> a system the player can use on certain objects or weakened opponents involving a touch-screen activated minigame unique to each world. These include dragging the screen to fling a target like a catapult, touching hidden words to take control of enemies, and playing a small rhythm-based game to cause fireworks to appear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{adaptation}} to a sinusoidal grating raises the contrast threshold for detecting gratings of similar spatial frequency and causes a shift in the apparent frequency of gratings of neighboring spatial frequency. In the present study the threshold rise and frequency <b>shift</b> <b>were</b> studied under two conditions: after adapting to a grating (successive condition) and while the test grating was surrounded by an inducing grating (simultaneous condition). The frequency <b>shift</b> <b>was</b> quantitatively similar under both conditions. Furthermore, the simultaneous <b>shift</b> <b>was</b> found to have the same dependence on the inducing contrast and orientation as did the successive shift. A rise in the threshold of the test grating, however, was found only in the successive condition. This indicates that the threshold rise and frequency <b>shift</b> <b>are</b> dissociated. A one-stage neural model was examined to see whether the frequency <b>shift</b> could <b>be</b> quantitatively predicted from the threshold rise. The predictions were poor. A two-stage model was thus proposed to account for the results...|$|R
