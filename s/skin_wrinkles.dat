60|$|It was {{my second}} day at surf-riding, and I was quite proud of myself. I stayed out there four hours, {{and when it}} was over, I was {{resolved}} that on the morrow I'd come in standing up. But that resolution paved a distant place. On the morrow I was in bed. I was not sick, but I was very unhappy, and I was in bed. When describing the wonderful water of Hawaii I forgot to describe the wonderful sun of Hawaii. It is a tropic sun, and, furthermore, {{in the first part of}} June, it is an overhead sun. It is also an insidious, deceitful sun. For the first time in my life I was sunburned unawares. My arms, shoulders, and back had been burned many times in the past and were tough; but not so my legs. And for four hours I had exposed the tender backs of my legs, at right- angles, to that perpendicular Hawaiian sun. It was not until after I got ashore that I discovered the sun had touched me. Sunburn at first is merely warm; after that it grows intense and the blisters come out. Also, the joints, where the <b>skin</b> <b>wrinkles,</b> refuse to bend. That is why I spent the next day in bed. I couldn't walk. And that is why, to-day, I am writing this in bed. It is easier to than not to. But to-morrow, ah, to-morrow, I shall be out in that wonderful water, and I shall come in standing up, even as Ford and Freeth. And if I fail to-morrow, I shall do it the next day, or the next. Upon one thing I am resolved: the Snark shall not sail from Honolulu until I, too, wing my heels with the swiftness of the sea, and become a sun-burned, skin-peeling Mercury.|$|E

30|$|Exposure to {{ultraviolet}} (UV) rays influences {{production of}} collagen making the skin darker. UV rays dry and destroy cells and underlying skin structure, giving the skin a furrowed and thickened appearance hastening development of wrinkles especially {{around the eyes}} due to squinting effects [42]. Long exposure to UV rays leads to variations in photoaging like <b>skin</b> <b>wrinkling,</b> elastosis, actinic keratosis, and irregular pigmentation [43]. With long exposure to UV rays, skin texture and color change becoming blotchy, yellowish, leathery, loose, inelastic, and hyper-pigmented. Blood veins close to the skin surface become protrusive forming “spider vein” network in addition to overall speckled skin appearance [44]. Naturally, with lower production of collagen and elastin, the skin becomes leathery and less elastic. Fat cells begin to disappear leading to skin sagging. Fat deposits in some areas like the eye lobe region also affect skin texture. Force of gravity makes the skin leathery and less elastic hence accelerating <b>skin</b> <b>wrinkling.</b>|$|R

50|$|In medicine, {{ablation}} is {{the same}} as removal of a part of biological tissue, usually by surgery. Surface ablation of the skin (dermabrasion, also called resurfacing because it induces regeneration) can be carried out by chemicals (chemoablation), by lasers (laser ablation), by freezing (cryoablation), or by electricity (fulguration). Its purpose is to remove skin spots, aged <b>skin,</b> <b>wrinkles,</b> thus rejuvenating it. Surface ablation is also employed in otolaryngology for several kinds of surgery, such as for snoring. Ablation therapy using radio frequency waves on the heart is used to cure a variety of cardiac arrhythmiae such as supraventricular tachycardia, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), ventricular tachycardia, and more recently as management of atrial fibrillation. The term is often used in the context of laser ablation, a process in which a laser dissolves a material's molecular bonds. For a laser to ablate tissues, the power density or fluence must be high, otherwise thermocoagulation occurs, which is simply thermal vaporization of the tissues.|$|E

50|$|A species called Pak {{lives on}} a planet near the Milky Way core. The species has three main stages of development: Child, Breeder, Protector. A Pak is born, and matures into a Breeder, at which point {{he or she may}} bear children. Breeders are not {{particularly}} intelligent. Around 40 years of age, the root of the Tree-of-Life plant begins to smell delicious to all Breeders, and they eat it and metamorphose into the Protector stage via a virus that lives in the plant. A Protector's joints expand to give his muscles a greater moment arm, his <b>skin</b> <b>wrinkles</b> into a tough armor, and his nails turn into retractile claws. A second heart develops near the groin, the mouth fuses into a beak, and all sexual characteristics disappear. The most important change is that the brain expands, giving a Protector a tremendous intellect. A Protector has no motivation other than the preservation of his bloodline, and to that end the Pak homeworld is never free from war, since all Protectors are constantly trying to ensure their progeny's survival at the expense of everyone else. If a Protector has no children left, he no longer feels the urge to eat and dies unless he can adopt the entire Pak race and work towards their benefit.|$|E

40|$|Excessive <b>skin</b> <b>wrinkling</b> and {{cutis laxa}} {{are seen in}} many genetic {{conditions}} and overlapping features can make a clinical diagnosis difficult. Here we report on 22 Omani patients from 11 consanguineous families with the diagnosis of wrinkly skin syndrome (WSS, OMIM 278250) or geroderma osteodysplasticum hereditaria (GO, OMIM 231070). The WSS phenotype evolves during early childhood and includes a generalized and excessive <b>skin</b> <b>wrinkling,</b> dental problems, herniae, foot deformities, hip dislocations, growth retardation, and a large anterior fontanelle. The facial gestalt {{is characterized by a}} broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism, and downslanting palpebral fissures. We were unable to differentiate between WSS and cutis laxa with growth and developmental delay (CLGDD, OMIM 219200) suggesting that both can be considered as one entity. Distinct hallmarks of GO were <b>skin</b> <b>wrinkling</b> limited to the dorsum of hands and feet and to the abdomen, normal fontanelles, maxillary hypoplasia, bowed long bones, and osteopenia with frequent fractures. In contrast to the attenuation of the skin phenotype with age in WSS, adult patients with GO appeared prematurely aged. A serum sialotransferrin type 2 pattern was found in all four WSS patients tested. Apolipoprotein CIII (a marker for O-glycosylation) was normal suggesting that WSS is frequently associated with a N-protein glycosylation defect, probably at the level of processing (CDG-II). All four investigated GO patients showed normal sialotransferrin patterns. The known loci for cutis laxa and WSS on 2 q 31, 5 q 23 -q 31, 7 q 11, 11 q 13, and 14 q 32 were excluded.

40|$|Although topical creams {{and other}} anti-aging {{products}} purport {{to reduce the}} appearance of aging and <b>skin</b> <b>wrinkling,</b> {{there has been no}} critical analysis in the scientific literature of their effectiveness. This systematic review critically evaluates the evidence for the effectiveness or efficacy of botanical treatments in reducing <b>skin</b> aging and <b>wrinkling.</b> MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL®, CENTRAL and AMED databases were searched from their inception until October 2009. Reference lists of retrieved articles were hand-searched. Manufacturers and professional associations were contacted in order to identify further non-published studies. No language restrictions were applied. Only randomized clinical trials or controlled clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of botanical extracts in reducing wrinkling and aging of the skin were included. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers and methodological quality was assessed using the Jadad score and key aspects of the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Of 36 potentially relevant studies, 11 trials of botanical extracts for reducing <b>skin</b> <b>wrinkling</b> and the appearance of aging met all the inclusion criteria. No trials were identified following contact with anti-aging and cosmetic organizations, companies and professional bodies. A significant reduction in <b>skin</b> <b>wrinkling</b> was noted for date kernel extract, cork extract, soy extract, Rosaceae and peony extract. No significant reduction was noted for green tea, Vitaphenol® (a combination of green and white teas, mangosteen and pomegranate extract) or maca root. All trials were of poor methodological quality. Adverse effects were frequently not reported. In summary, there is some weak evidence to suggest that several botanical extracts may be effective in reducing the appearance of skin aging but no evidence that this effect is enduring. Independent replications with larger, more diverse samples, longer treatment durations and more rigorous study designs are required to validate these preliminary findings...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Clone" [...] tool is very {{important}} in photograph manipulation on computer graphics software. The clone tool is used to actively copy and offset pixels from one area of an image to another while the artist moves the clone tool around the area to be copied. A good example is the use of the clone tool to cover a skin blemish by copying skin from one area of an image and placing it over the blemish. An important aspect of making a clone tool blend well in an image is to use feathering on the clone tool. This makes the pixels being copied have more effect on the area they are copied to closer to where the artist is dragging his or her mouse or stylus, and makes the pixels have less effect the farther they are from the clone tool (and where the artist is using it). Thus, with the skin example, skin pixels copied directly over the blemish will have strong effect on the blemish, thus hiding it, but skin pixels copied to the area around the blemish will not affect this area much, and will keep the natural look of the <b>skin</b> (<b>wrinkles</b> etc.) intact as much as possible.|$|E

40|$|The {{desire of}} many to look young for their age {{has led to}} the {{establishment}} of a large cosmetics industry. However, the features of appearance that primarily determine how old women look for their age and whether genetic or environmental factors predominately influence such features are largely unknown. We studied the facial appearance of 102 pairs of female Danish twins aged 59 to 81 as well as 162 British females aged 45 to 75. Skin wrinkling, hair graying and lip height were significantly and independently associated with how old the women looked for their age. The appearance of facial sun-damage was also found to be significantly correlated to how old women look for their age and was primarily due to its commonality with the appearance of <b>skin</b> <b>wrinkles.</b> There was also considerable variation in the perceived age data that was unaccounted for. Composite facial images created from women who looked young or old for their age indicated that the structure of subcutaneous tissue was partly responsible. Heritability analyses of the appearance features revealed that perceived age, pigmented age spots, <b>skin</b> <b>wrinkles</b> and the appearance of sun-damage were influenced more or less equally by genetic and environmental factors. Hair graying, recession of hair from the forehead and lip height were influenced mainly by genetic factors whereas environmental factors influenced hair thinning. These findings indicate that women who look young for their age have large lips, avoid sun-exposure and possess genetic factors that protect against the development of gray hair and <b>skin</b> <b>wrinkles.</b> The findings also demonstrate that perceived age is a better biomarker of skin, hair and facial aging than chronological age...|$|E
