25|$|That Bishop Moreton, in {{that very}} room, (for he was, when Bishop of Chester, parson of Stockport,) did <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and some others, about non-conformity, that they despised the Common Prayer; but it had {{converted}} more than all their preaching could do or ever would do, or to that purpose. Which expression we much wondered at, from so learned a man, and so great a divine as he was.|$|E
25|$|My {{grandfather}} Thorgny {{could well}} remember the Uppsala king Eirik Eymundson, {{and used to}} say of him {{that when he was}} in his best years he went out every summer on expeditions to different countries, and conquered for himself Finland, Kirjalaland, Courland, Esthonia, and the eastern countries all around; and at the present day the earth-bulwarks, ramparts, and other great works which he made are to be seen. And, more over, he was not so proud that he would not listen to people who had anything to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} 1955 Campbell {{decided to}} give up editing in favour of his {{scientific}} career as a research chemist. He was replaced from the February 1956 issue by E.C. Tubb, who remained editor {{to the end of}} the magazine's life. Tubb had contributed a great deal of material to the magazine under various pseudonyms, often amounting to more than half of an issue's fiction, and he later recalled that Campbell's way of hiring him as editor was to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "As you're practically writing it, you may as well edit it." ...|$|E
500|$|To evoke genuine {{emotions}} {{of shock and}} sadness, the final O.R. scene was kept a secret from the cast, {{with the exception of}} Alan Alda, until immediately before filming; only then did Gelbart hand out the last page of the script. As a result, Stevenson was still on the set to see the final scene being filmed. After shooting was completed, a season-ending cast party was planned. Stevenson left the set almost immediately after the end of filming, and the party was canceled due to the poor mood of the cast. Stevenson later {{said in an interview that}} he was deeply hurt that his character's death was revealed in that fashion and the party was [...] "ruined." [...] Gelbart later said of the event, [...] "I wish we could <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> 'We didn't mean it, Mac.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{theme of}} Xander's dream is {{his sense of}} failure and of being left behind as his friends move ahead in life. His fear that he is stuck is reiterated {{throughout}} his dream by his inability to escape his basement bedroom in his parents' home. No matter where his dream takes him, he ends up back in the basement. As {{the only one of}} the Scoobies not in college, he feels anxiety about his ability to understand and keep up with ideas and conversations, a fear which is realized when he goes to the university, a place he already feels excluded from, and finds that he cannot understand what people <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Aware that he is being chased and is in danger, he asks Giles what is happening but cannot understand his answer, nor what Anya says to him, as they are both inexplicably speaking French. He exclaims, [...] "I don't understand!" [...] During his dream both Buffy and Willow tell him, [...] "I'm way ahead of you," [...] and Giles tells him [...] "the others have gone on ahead," [...] underscoring his fear that this is really the case.|$|E

500|$|The AFL's {{experiment}} was largely derided by AFL personalities throughout Hunt's early Australian rules career. [...] Wayne Carey is quoted {{to have said}} that [...] "I just think he's really going to struggle. I'm just not sure a rugby player - {{as good as he}} is - can do it." [...] Tony Shaw was quoted in 2011 to have said [...] "he just cannot play the game naturally and it won't work. Just <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> 'Take your money, you've been fantastic for us', maybe see the year out, but I wouldn't be playing him very often any more." [...] Paul Roos is quoted to have said that [...] "a player of Karmichael Hunt's current ability would probably be worth only $100,000 in the AFL". [...] Jason Akermanis is quoted to have said in reference to both Hunt and Israel Folau – who converted from rugby league to Australian rules football the year after Hunt – that [...] "if they can't run and they can't handball - and we're only talking basics like kick, run, chase, handball and get body-to-body collisions - and can't get up to speed its going to be such {{a waste of time and}} money." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 2007, Washington {{appeared}} on Larry King Live, {{to present his}} side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who he felt was treating him like a [...] "B-word", a [...] "P-word", and the [...] "F-word", which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back". In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: [...] "I wasn't interested in what anybody thought publicly. I was interested in what was going on right here on the ground...with the people I work with every day. Did I do it perfectly? Of course not. This is my first television show. It was a learning experience." [...] Knight said that Rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out, however Rhimes said: [...] "I remember saying , 'This is our proudest day here. T.R. got to come out and I got to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he was going to come out and George would suddenly be gay.

You're letting down all the {{individuals}} who are reformers within Islam who are asking the right questions that will ultimately bring about change.|$|E

2500|$|At the 2007 Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, Powell {{revealed}} that he had spent {{two and a half}} hours explaining to President Bush [...] "the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers." [...] During this discussion, he insisted that the U.S. appeal to the United Nations first, but if diplomacy failed, he would support the invasion: [...] "I also had to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that you are the President, you will have to make the ultimate judgment, and if the judgment is this isn't working and we don't think it is going to solve the problem, then if military action is undertaken I'm with you, I support you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), in the morning, Balaam asked Balak's dignitaries to leave, as God {{would not let}} him go with them, and they left and {{reported}} Balaam's answer to Balak. Then Balak sent more numerous and distinguished dignitaries, who offered Balaam rich rewards in return for damning the Israelites. But Balaam replied: [...] "Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, big or little, contrary to the command of the Lord my God." [...] Nonetheless, Balaam invited the dignitaries to stay overnight to let Balaam find out what else God might <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and that night God told Balaam: [...] "If these men have come to invite you, you may go with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In other cases, the {{examining}} magistrate {{must consider the}} evidence tendered by the prosecution and decide if there are sufficient grounds for committing the accused for trial.

Otherwise, if {{the examining}} magistrate feels that the accused should be committed for trial in the High Court based on the prosecution's evidence, the charge tendered by the prosecution must be read and explained to the accused, and the magistrate must <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> or her the following words or words to similar effect: ...|$|E

2500|$|The British naval Commander-in-Chief of the Jamaica station Admiral Sir John Duckworth, {{accepted}} the French commander General Rochambeau, {{his staff and}} entourage, as prisoners. Duckworth wrote [...] "From General Rochambeau's extraordinary conduct in the public service, neither Captain Bligh or myself have any thing to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> further than complying with his wishes in allowing him to remain on board the Surveillante until her arrival at Jamaica." [...] Another French frigate, the HMS Clorinde, suffered {{the loss of her}} rudder and was temporarily beached, although she was re-floated and taken as a prize. Consequently both frigates were brought into the Royal Navy as HMS Surveillante and HMS Clorinde. Surveillante, newly built, was bought into the Service quickly; the first recorded Navy Pay Office Ships' Pay Books from the Navy Board commenced from 11 July 1804.|$|E

Even when Lana Cantrell came into the scene I was puzzled and I did <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> why all this, and of course we all know it was good publicity. Lana came to the house and I had to go up, and have it all cleaned, ready for her and her party to come one Sunday night.

An unseen man and woman (Godard and Florence Colombani) paint with watercolors and black ink. They order Roxy {{out of the room and}} (paraphrasing Dostoyevsky's Demons) compare Kirillov's two questions, [...] "a big one and a little one" [...] (the other world and suffering) and the [...] "difficult fit flatness into depth" [...] to the act of creating art. [...] Roxy falls asleep on a couch as a narrator (Anne-Marie Miéville) describes his thoughts and the film ends with the sounds of a dog barking and a baby crying.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} notable ways was {{demonstrated}} in the 1992 Olympics, when the Dream Team, including Jordan and Pippen, took on Croatia for the gold medal. The Croatia team featured Toni Kukoč, a young star whom Krause had discovered through European contacts and was courting {{to a degree that}} some of the Bulls found annoying. Jordan biographer David Halberstam said that Jordan and Pippen [...] "seemed to play against Kukoc as if they had a vendetta", and that [...] "in the end, {{it was as if they}} had been playing not against Kukoc but against Krause." [...] Jordan would later be quoted as saying: [...] "The trade of Oakley was good, and the best thing he did was to get Pippen and Grant. That's it. His claim to fame is that he drafted Earl Monroe for the Bullets. And I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> 'What pick was that?' He says, 'Two.' And I say, 'Hell! Earl Monroe was a real secret, huh?

2500|$|Like {{many young}} heirs {{in an age}} when kings governed most of Europe, Ludwig was {{continually}} reminded of his royal status. King Maximilian wanted to instruct both of his sons in the burdens of royal duty from an early age. Ludwig was both extremely indulged and severely controlled by his tutors and subjected to a strict regimen of study and exercise. There are some who point to these stresses of growing up in a royal family as the causes for much of his odd behavior as an adult. [...] Ludwig was not close to either of his parents. King Maximilian's advisers had suggested that on his daily walks he might like, at times, to be accompanied by his future successor. The King replied, [...] "But what am I to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him?</b> After all, my son takes no interest in what other people tell him." [...] Later, Ludwig would refer to his mother as [...] "my predecessor's consort". He was far closer to his grandfather, the deposed and notorious King Ludwig I, who came from a family of eccentrics.|$|E
