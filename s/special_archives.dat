50|$|A {{photo of}} Louis Rorimer (1872-1939) by Ethel Standiford-Mehlingan appears {{in an article}} about him in an {{interview}} with his grandson from The Plain Dealer. Ethel Standiford's portrait of Louis Rorimer is of the patriarch of this family, the father of James Joseph Rorimer (1905-1966) who is the man upon whom the role of Lt. James Granger was loosely based in the film The Monuments Men. James Rorimer was one of the Allied special forces in the Monuments, Arts, and <b>Special</b> <b>Archives</b> program who helped recover confiscated art from the Nazis during World War II. James Rorimer later became the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a major force behind the creation of The Cloisters. His character as a young American soldier is played in the film by Matt Damon. The interviewee in The Plain Dealer article by Steven Litt is also named Louis Rorimer, but he is the grandson of the subject of the Standiford portrait shown in the article and the son of James Rorimer. Two photographs of Anna Burge Muir, attributed to Standiford studio and borrowed from a 1927 Louisville Herald-Post article, appear in a website about the The Little Colonel stories for children by Annie Fellows Johnston. One is of Anna as a child and one is of her as the grownup wife of lawyer Edward Porter Humphrey. Anna Burge Muir Humphrey was the real-life model for the character Anna Moore (Rob Moore's cousin) in the stories.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, Bykov {{started working}} on a new {{historical}} project. He gathered materials about the stay of the Entente diplomatic corps in Vologda in 1918. Bykov worked in <b>special</b> <b>archives</b> in Russia, in the U.S.A, and France. In 1998, his first big work on this subject, a book “the Diplomatic capital of Russia” was published. At the same time he organized and held an international conference “Russia and the World community in the early 20th century: Theory and practice of mutual relations” inside the walls of the “Museum of Diplomatic Corps”. In 1999, Bykov worked on a new monograph on the fate of the grand dukes Romanov, exiled in 1918 in Vologda and shot to death without legitimate criminal investigations and court decisions. The book, based on unknown archival data, gives a detailed story of the last months, of the grand dukes Romanov, Pavel Alexandrovich, Nikolay Constantinovich, and Georgiy Mikhailovich. The name of the latter is well known to the specialists in Russian numismatics history. In January 2009, Bykov published a book entitled “And Tanya’s golden name”, where he narrated about a famous Russian poet Nikolay Rubtsov’s first love for Tatiana Reshetova (Agafonova, maiden name). The poet had devoted more that 20 poems to Reshetova, including the famous “Bouquet.” The author managed to get unique information and materials about Rubtsov from Reshetova. He was interested in the materials which had been used for the plot of the poems. Before Bykov nobody had made such a detailed research on the first love of the poet. In the book itself the author described the meeting of Reshetova and Rubtsov, their dates, letters, separation and the love that the poet cherished for many years, depicting his love in his poetry.|$|E
