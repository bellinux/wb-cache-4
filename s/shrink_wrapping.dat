50|$|Their second {{full-length}} set Dial 'M' for Motherfucker, {{was released}} in 1989 and continued their formula of nihilistic guitar noise and punk rock provocation, with additional studio trickery filling out the material. Originally intended to be titled Make Them All Eat Shit Slowly, {{the name of the}} album was ultimately vetoed by Caroline Records. The album is sometimes wrongly referred to as New Album By Pussy Galore. This is largely {{due to the fact that}} the cover of the album has no text except for a sticker that appeared on the plastic <b>shrink</b> <b>wrapping</b> that bears those words. Dial M represents a move away from a simple noise formula to something more experimental. It is, for example, difficult to determine where some songs begin and end. Many sequences on the album appear to run in reverse, sometimes mid-song, seemingly for no apparent reason. Cafritz appears on some of this album but not the entirety. Dial M marks a point at which Cafritz and the band began fighting, ultimately leading to her leaving the band.|$|E

Sets on eBay and Amazon have been known to sell from $700-$1000 as of 2016. These boxes are more and more scarce to each day due to very low print run.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{simplicity}} and flexibility, polygonal meshes {{are about to}} become the standard representation for surface geometry in computer graphics applications. Some algorithms {{in the context of}} multiresolution representation and modeling can be performed much more efficiently and robustly if the underlying surface tesselations have the special subdivision connectivity. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for converting a given unstructured triangle mesh into one having subdivision connectivity. The basic idea is to simulate the <b>shrink</b> <b>wrapping</b> process by adapting the deformable surface technique known from image processing. The resulting algorithm generates subdivision connectivity meshes whose base meshes only have {{a very small number of}} triangles. The iterative optimization process that distributes the mesh vertices over the given surface geometry guarantees low local distortion of the triangular faces. We show several examples and applications including the progressi [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Cell–matrix {{interactions}} {{are important for}} the physical integration of cells into tissues and the function of insoluble, mechanosensitive signaling networks. Studying these interactions in vitro can be difficult because the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that adsorb to in vitro cell culture surfaces do not fully recapitulate the ECM-dense basement membranes to which cells such as cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells adhere to in vivo. Towards addressing this limitation, we have developed a surface-initiated assembly process to engineer ECM proteins into nanostructured, microscale sheets that can be shrink wrapped around single cells and small cell ensembles to provide a functional and instructive matrix niche. Unlike current cell encapsulation technology using alginate, fibrin or other hydrogels, our engineered ECM is similar in density and thickness to native basal lamina and can be tailored in structure and composition using the proteins fibronectin, laminin, fibrinogen, and/or collagen type IV. A range of cells including C 2 C 12 myoblasts, bovine corneal endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes survive the <b>shrink</b> <b>wrapping</b> process with high viability. Further, we demonstrate that, compared to non-encapsulated controls, the engineered ECM modulates cytoskeletal structure, stability of cell–matrix adhesions and cell behavior in 2 D and 3 D microenvironments...|$|E

Subjects were briefly shown a random set of point-like dots which were then masked, and subsequently reappeared with a possible added or deleted dot.

The data are consistent with the view that the fastest of the perceptual processes is a global system which proceeds from the periphery inward toward fixation and that a separate slower local analytical sequence starts at fixation and works outward. I conjecture that proximity, one, if not the most salient of all features in the early perceptual processes that extract data from the sensory store and encode it in the visual memory systems, is not itself stored as part of the representation...|$|E
