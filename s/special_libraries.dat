500|$|The {{growth of}} the {{classification}} to date had led to significant criticism from medium and large libraries which were too large to use the abridged edition but found the full classification overwhelming. Dewey had intended issuing the classification in three editions: the library edition, {{which would be the}} fullest edition; the bibliographic edition, in English and French, which was to be used for the organization of bibliographies rather than of books on the shelf; and the abridged edition. In 1933, the bibliographic edition became the Universal Decimal Classification, which left the library and abridged versions as the formal Dewey Decimal Classification editions. The 15th edition, edited by Milton Ferguson, implemented the growing concept of the [...] "standard edition", designed for the majority of general libraries but not attempting to satisfy the needs of the very largest or of <b>special</b> <b>libraries.</b> It also reduced the size of the Dewey system by over half, from 1,900 to 700 pages. This revision was so radical that an advisory committee was formed right away for the 16th and 17th editions. The 16th and 17th editions, under the editorship of the Library of Congress, grew again to two volumes. However, by now, the Dewey Decimal system had established itself as a classification for general libraries, with the Library of Congress Classification having gained acceptance for large research libraries.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Special</b> <b>libraries</b> {{often have}} a more {{specific}} clientele than libraries in traditional educational or public settings, and deal with more specialized kinds of information.

Those that are open to the public may offer services similar to research, reference, public, academic, or children's libraries, often with restrictions such as only lending books to patients at a hospital or restricting the public from parts of a military collection. Many <b>special</b> <b>libraries</b> are not open to the general public, though access may be requested for specialized research by request. <b>Special</b> <b>libraries</b> are also sometimes known as information centers.

[...] They are generally staffed by librarians, although many librarians employed in <b>special</b> <b>libraries</b> are specialists in the library's field rather than generally trained librarians, and often are not required to have advanced degrees in specifically library-related field due to the specialized content and clientele of the library.
