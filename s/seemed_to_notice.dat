500|$|Crane {{decided to}} publish it privately, with money he had {{inherited}} from his mother. The novel was published in late February or early March 1893 by a small printing shop that usually printed medical books and religious tracts. [...] The typewritten title page for the Library of Congress copyright application read simply: [...] "A Girl of the Streets, / A Story of New York. / —By—/Stephen Crane." [...] The name [...] "Maggie" [...] {{was added to the}} title later. Crane used the pseudonym [...] "Johnston Smith" [...] for the novel's initial publication, later telling friend and artist Corwin Knapp Linson that the nom de plume was the [...] "commonest name I could think of. [...] I had an editor friend named Johnson, and put in the [...] "t", and no one could find me in the mob of Smiths." [...] Hamlin Garland reviewed the work in the June 1893 issue of The Arena, calling it [...] "the most truthful and unhackneyed study of the slums I have yet read, fragment though it is." [...] Despite this early praise, Crane became depressed and destitute from having spent $869 for 1,100copies of a novel that did not sell; he ended up giving a hundred copies away. [...] He would later remember [...] "how I looked forward to publication and pictured the sensation I thought it would make. It fell flat. Nobody <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> it or care for it... Poor Maggie! She was one of my first loves." ...|$|E
2500|$|During another {{performance}} on her world tour, a backstage door was opened during {{a performance of}} Phėdre, and a cold wind blew across the stage as Bernhardt was reciting. Without interrupting her speech, she added [...] "If someone doesn't close that door I will catch pneumonia." [...] The door was closed, {{and no one in}} the audience <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> the addition.|$|E
2500|$|The pair began asserting their {{perceived}} immunity from normal restrictions with acts of petty theft and vandalism. Breaking into a fraternity {{house at the}} university, they stole penknives, a camera, and a typewriter [...] that they later used to type their ransom note. Emboldened, they progressed {{to a series of}} more serious crimes, including arson, but no one <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice.</b> Disappointed with the absence of media coverage of their crimes, they decided to plan and execute a sensational [...] "perfect crime" [...] that would garner public attention, and confirm their self-proclaimed status as [...] "supermen".|$|E

2500|$|Paramount hired Boam in 1992 {{to write}} a script for The Phantom, based on Lee Falk's comic strip character, with Joe Dante to direct. The box office failure of The Shadow, a similarly-themed period adventure, put the film on hold for several years. Boam's {{original}} script {{was intended to be}} a funny spoof of The Phantom. The studio restarted the film with Simon Wincer as director, who had Boam make changes to the original script, including a decision to keep the screenplay close in style and tone to the source material. Dante said that [...] "nobody <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> it was written to be funny, so it was [...] disastrously [...] played straight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other reasons {{include the}} passage not being {{something}} a devout Jew such as Josephus would write (especially, [...] "if it be lawful {{to call him}} a man" [...] and [...] "doer of incredible deeds"), as his writing was usually sophisticated and would have explained {{anything out of the}} ordinary to his Gentile audience, such as explaining what the word [...] "Christ" [...] means, why Jesus was called that and further explanations such as how he won over many Jews and Greeks, as he did for every other group (see [...] ), or why he would mention Jesus [...] "appearing" [...] in the [...] "third day"—a Christian creed—without explaining it and how no one <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> this passage until the 4th century, not even Origen who quotes Josephus extensively in his works, thus leading mythicists to think that the Testimonium Flavianum is a forgery of the 4th century, perhaps written by Eusebius in order to provide an outside Jewish authority for the life of Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|... Madame Geoffrin was {{the first}} child of a bourgeois named Pierre Rodet, a valet de chambre for the Duchess of Burgundy, and Angelique Thérèse Chemineau, the {{daughter}} of a Parisian Banker. Marie Thérèse's mother died a year later in giving birth to her son Louis. At age seven, Marie Thérèse and her brother were taken to live with their grandmother Madame Chemineau on the rue Saint-Honoré. At thirteen, she was engaged to be married to the widower Francois Geoffrin, a lieutenant-colonel of the National Guard and a prosperous general cashier of the Saint-Gobain Venetian mirror manufactory. Despite {{the fact that he was}} in his fortcy-ninth year, and Marie Thérèse had barely passed her fourteenth birthday, Monsieur Geoffrin had inherited a substantial fortune from his first wife, and the chance for [...] "an excellent settlement" [...] was thought to be quite suitable by Madame Chemineau. The marriage took place on 19 July 1713. Nearly two years after the wedding, she gave birth to her first child, a daughter, and the future Marquise de la Ferté Imbault. Her second child, a son, (who was to die later in childhood) was born two years later. It was not until Madame Geoffrin was over her thirtieth year that her connection to the salons would become established. [...] Her husband, Pierre François Geofrin died December 20, 1749, a fact that was hardly noticed by Mme Geoffrin's visitors--indeed, Madame Geoffrey hardly <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> herself.|$|E
