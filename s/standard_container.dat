25|$|In {{countries}} where the railway loading gauge is sufficient, truck trailers are often carried by rail. Variations exist, including open-topped versions covered by a fabric curtain are used to transport larger loads. A container called a tanktainer, with a tank inside a <b>standard</b> <b>container</b> frame, carries liquids. Refrigerated containers (reefer) are used for perishables. Swap body units have the same bottom corners as intermodal containers but are {{not strong enough to}} be stacked. They have folding legs under their frame and can be moved between trucks without using a crane.|$|E
25|$|A full {{container}} load (FCL) is an ISO <b>standard</b> <b>container</b> that {{is loaded}} and unloaded under the risk and account of one shipper and only one consignee. In practice, {{it means that the}} whole container is intended for one consignee. FCL container shipment tends to have lower freight rates than an equivalent weight of cargo in bulk. FCL is intended to designate a container loaded to its allowable maximum weight or volume, but FCL in practice on ocean freight does not always mean a full payload or capacity - many companies will prefer to keep a 'mostly' full container as a single container load to simplify logistics and increase security compared to sharing a container with other goods.|$|E

2500|$|A [...] "tag" [...] in {{an audio}} file is {{a section of}} the file that {{contains}} metadata such as the title, artist, album, track number or other information about the file's contents. The MP3 standards do not define tag formats for MP3 files, nor is there a <b>standard</b> <b>container</b> format that would support metadata and obviate the need for tags. However, several de facto standards for tag formats exist. As of 2010, the most widespread are ID3v1 and ID3v2, and the more recently introduced APEv2. These tags are normally embedded at the beginning or end of MP3 files, separate from the actual MP3 frame data. MP3 decoders either extract information from the tags, or just treat them as ignorable, non-MP3 junk data.|$|E
2500|$|The barmaster or {{his deputy}} granted title in a mine, the usual name for which was grove or groove, on receipt of proof {{that it was}} viable.

He was given permission to work 2 meers of ground, known as founder meers, with no restriction on width or depth. A third meer was the king's, and other miners were each allowed to open a further meer, taker meers, along the vein. The miner marked each meer with his possessions or stows (a miniature version of the stows or windlass used to wind the ore from the shaft). A meer was , in the Wirksworth Wapentake.|$|E

40|$|This note {{proposes a}} {{straightforward}} and simple method for the criticality safety analysis of fissionable materials configured into large arrays of <b>standard</b> <b>containers.</b> While criticality-safe storage limits have been well-established for <b>standard</b> <b>containers</b> [...] even under flooded conditions, {{it is also}} necessary {{to rule out the}} potential for criticality arising from neutronic interactions among multiple containers that might build up over long distances in a large array. Traditionally, the array problem has been approached by individual Monte Carlo analyses of explicit arrangements of single units and their surroundings. Here, the authors show how multiple Monte Carlo analyses can be usefully combined for wide-ranging general application. The technique takes advantage of low average density of fissionable material in typical storage arrays to separate neutron interactions that take place in the neutron`s ``birth unit`` from subsequent interactions in a highly dilute array. Effects of array size, in particular, are conservatively calculated by straightforward analyses which simply smear array contents uniformly across the extent of the array. For given unit loadings in <b>standard</b> <b>containers,</b> practical expressions for neutron multiplication depend only on overall array shape, size and reflective boundary...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Washington and Oregon became {{important}} {{states in}} the production of apples and pears in the early 1900 's. During these beginning stages, wooden boxes were used for shipping both apples and pears. Apple containerization has progressed through several stages. Today, the most common container for shipment of apples out of the Northwest is the tray-packed corrugated carton. Pear containerization, on the other hand, has changed only slightly. Presently, the container most commonly used for shipment of pears is a wooden box of approximately the same dimensions as its early predecessor. Improvements on the wooden box have been made, but basically the container has remained unchanged. In this study, the tray-packed apple carton and the wooden pear box are referred to as <b>standard</b> <b>containers.</b> These two <b>standard</b> <b>containers</b> will be compared to a five bushel, corrugated container, which will be referred to as a bulk bin. In evaluating the expenses which arise when packing fruit in bulk and <b>standard</b> <b>containers,</b> only the cost differentials were discussed. The major cost categories that were analyzed were: labor, materials, packing house commissions and overhead, and miscellaneous. Due {{to the nature of the}} packing house operations, only labor and material expenses gave rise to cost differentials. The cost differential in favor of bulk <b>containers</b> over <b>standard</b> <b>containers</b> was l. 4784 per 100 pounds of packed apples and 1. 2995 per 100 pounds of packed pears. In order to determine the shipping quality of bulk containers, three shipments of fruit packed in bulk containers were inspected. Two shipments of Anjou pears packed in <b>standard</b> and bulk <b>containers</b> were sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The third shipment was sent to Los Angeles, California and consisted of Red Delicious apples packed in bulk containers. In the pear shipments, three types of damage were recorded. These were: bruising, discoloration, and punctures or skin tears, In the apple shipment, only bruising and puncture damage were recorded. After the containers were inspected and the damages recorded, comparisons between containers were made. Using statistical methods, it was shown that there was no difference in total damage between the bulk and <b>standard</b> <b>containers.</b> In order to determine where the damage was occurring, the bulk containers were divided by height into three equal layers. Using this procedure, the damages occurring in the top, middle, and bottom layers could be identified and compared. Bruising was found to be most severe in the bottom layer. Discoloration and puncture damage was not affected by the layer treatment. From the information gathered in this study, it appears that two important observations can be made. First, the cost associated with 100 pounds of fruit can be substantially reduced by using bulk bins and second, the arrival condition of apples and pears packed in bulk containers will be about the same as fruit packed in <b>standard</b> <b>containers...</b>|$|R
