5|$|Great Auk calls {{included}} low croaking and {{a hoarse}} scream. A captive great auk was observed making a gurgling noise when anxious.

50|$|The limbs {{were more}} <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> modern large bovids (e.g. buffaloes) than <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> okapis.

5|$|Like {{the modern}} pygmy hippopotamus, the Malagasy pygmy hippo has {{eyes on the}} side of its head rather than high orbits and teeth <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pygmy hippopotamus.

5|$|Most of the {{provisions}} of section 29 are plainly <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sixth Amendment, namely the Information Clause, the Assistance of Counsel Clause, and the Compulsory Process Clause.

5|$|Ninox boobook cinnamomina {{is found}} on Tepa and Babar Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It has {{cinnamon}} upperparts, brownish crown and cinnamon-streaked underparts. Its redder coloration and small size led German naturalist Ernst Hartert to describe it as a distinct taxon in 1906. The call is <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Its {{effects in}} humans are reputedly <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> PMA, but {{slightly}} more empathogenic in nature.

5|$|This small martin's {{flight is}} {{typically}} slow and leisurely, {{but it is}} capable of considerable speed when required. The calls are <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eurasian crag martin and include a soft chi, chi contact call and a twittering song.|$|E

5|$|Faith et al. 2013 further {{suggested}} that the bluebuck, being a grazer, probably favoured grassland habitats. This hypothesis is supported by fossil evidencebluebuck fossils appear in significant numbers {{along with those of}} grassland antelopes. Kerley et al. 2009 {{suggested that}} the bluebuck frequented grasslands and shunned wooded areas and thickets. In a 1976 study of fossils in the Southern Cape, Klein observed that the bluebuck's habitat preferences were <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and the reedbuck (Redunca).|$|E
5|$|Neptunium {{is found}} {{in at least three}} allotropes. Some claims of a fourth allotrope have been made, but they are so far not proven. This {{multiplicity}} of allotropes is common among the actinides. The crystal structures of neptunium, protactinium, uranium, and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3dtransition metals.|$|E
5|$|On the {{battlefield}} the Jägers provided strong leadership that made disciplined {{action by the}} common White soldiers possible. The White troopers were <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Guards with brief and inadequate training. At {{the beginning of the}} war, the leadership of the White Guards had little authority over volunteer White Guard platoons and companies, which obeyed only their dominant, local leaders. In the end of February, the Jägers started rapid training of six regiments with conscripts.|$|E

According to Petco, the animals are described as being somewhat unsuitable for children as they do not enjoy being held. Hobbyists have kept turtles alive for decades.|$|E
5|$|Subfossil parrot {{remains were}} later {{excavated}} from grottos on Réunion and reported in 1996. X-rays {{of the two}} existing stuffed Mascarene parrots {{made it possible to}} compare the remaining bones with the subfossils and showed these were intermediate in measurements in comparison to the modern specimens. The lesser vasa parrot was introduced to Réunion as early as 1780 but, though the subfossil parrot bones were similar to that species in some aspects, they were more <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mascarene parrot and considered to belong to it.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow's {{calls are}} chirps <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house sparrow, {{but much more}} musical and mellow. The basic call is used in flight and while {{perching}} socially and transcribed as chissip, chirrup, chreep, or chirrichup. A loud, distinctive call used by the male to advertise nest ownership can be written as tweeng or twileeng; this call can be extended into a jerky and repetitive song, chip cheerup, chip cheerup.|$|E

5|$|The core of {{the pyramid}} is made of roughly hewn {{limestone}} blocks <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main pyramid. These were disposed in two layers and finally clad with fine Tura limestone which fell victim to stone robbers. Consequently, the poor quality pyramid core was exposed and degradated rapidly with only the two lowest layers of the pyramid still visible today.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many of its}} fellow mimids, {{the black}} catbird is not known to imitate any other species. Its song {{consists}} of repeated phrases of notes ranging from harsh and scratchy to warbled and flute-like, often interspersed with metallic clicking buzzes. It often sings from exposed perches. It {{has a variety of}} calls, including some which are quite <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gray catbird; these are variously described as a harsh rriah, a nasal chrrh and a grating tcheeu.|$|E
5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. All {{of them are}} soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some {{of them can be}} cut with a knife. Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium {{is similar to that of}} soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3d-transition metals.|$|E
