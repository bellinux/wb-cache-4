50|$|The CKS-1 turret holds 2 lenses. Both {{positions}} {{secure a}} mounting bracket {{to connect to}} lenses. One position is the Cine Kodak mount, with a fixed 25mm lens. The other position is the Kodak S-Mount distinguished by an alignment pin and secured by a <b>screw</b> <b>collar.</b> The latter allows for insertion of interchangeable lenses. The mounting brackets have tilt-up viewfinders with masks according to the focal length.|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, New Zealand {{and many}} {{associated}} South Pacific island nations, the AS/NZ 3123 standard is used. In this series, multiple sizes of three-phase round-pin socket are standardized by current rating and neutral circuit. Each socket accepts plugs {{up to its}} rating, but excludes plugs with a higher current rating or with a neutral pin (if not on the socket). Multiphase plugs and sockets are rated at up to 500 V and all include an earth connection. These plugs and sockets are usually IP56 rated if fitted correctly. A <b>screw</b> <b>collar</b> helps hold plug and socket together.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{has greater}} vertical travel and more adjustability than the suspension on the Versys 650 siblings.. On the front thicker/stiffer 41 mm inverted front forks are externally adjustable for preload and rebound damping. The right fork leg carries a damping cartridge while both legs contain springs. The {{rear shock absorber}} is adjustable for rebound damping. Suspension preload is adjustable in the rear via a <b>screw</b> <b>collar</b> on the shock. 2015+ models have an external adjuster. The rear shock/spring is directly connected, without linkages, to a non symmetrical, gull wing, aluminum swing arm instead of the more basic steel swing arm used on the Ninja and ER-6.|$|E
5000|$|Class 6 {{occupies}} the largest proportion of UDC schedules. It contains over 44,000 subdivisions. Each specific field of technology or industry usually {{contains more than}} one special auxiliary table with concepts needed to express operations, processes, materials and products. As a result, UDC codes are often created through the combination of various attributes. Equally, some parts of this class enumerate concepts to a great level of detail e.g. 621.882.212 Hexagon screws with additional shapes. Including: Flank <b>screws.</b> <b>Collar</b> <b>screws.</b> Cap screws ...|$|R
50|$|Set <b>screw</b> <b>collars</b> {{are best}} used when the {{material}} of the shaft is softer than the set screw. Unfortunately, the set screw causes damage to the shaft - a flare-up of shaft material - which makes the collar harder to adjust or remove. It is common to machine small flats onto the shaft at the set screw locations to eliminate this problem.|$|R
5000|$|Elswick Pattern “T”: Had {{an inner}} A tube, A tube {{in two parts}} joined by <b>screwed</b> <b>collar,</b> B tube and half-length wire, jacket and short breech ring. A {{pneumatically}} operated Welin breech block was used {{and they were in}} hydraulic powered mounts. [...] The Armstrong gun was similar to the Vickers gun, but weighed 69.3 metric tons (68.2 long tons).|$|R
5000|$|The first mass-produced shaft <b>collars</b> {{were set}} <b>screw</b> <b>collars</b> and were used {{primarily}} on line shafting in early manufacturing mills. These early shaft collars were solid ring types, employing square-head set screws that protruded from the <b>collar.</b> Protruding <b>screws</b> {{proved to be}} a problem because they could catch on a worker's clothing while rotating on a shaft, and pull them into the machinery.|$|R
5000|$|On Saturday, 14 August 1915, the 08:45 Birmingham to Euston express {{passenger}} train hauled by LNWR George the Fifth Class locomotive No. 1489 lost a taper pin; its {{purpose was to}} lock a <b>screwed</b> <b>collar</b> which retained the offside coupling rod to its crank pin. The coupling rod detached and struck one of the sleepers on the up line; pushing the track out of alignment just as the 08:30 Euston to Holyhead Irish Mail train approached. It consisted of 15 coaches hauled by two locomotives LNWR Renown Class No. 1971 and Precedent Class No. 1189 and was travelling at 60 miles per hour. Both locomotives and every carriage was derailed; several being thrown down an embankment, killing 10 passengers and injuring 21 more. The approximate location of the collision was [...] between Weedon and Stowe Hill tunnel.|$|R
40|$|See {{appendix}} {{for part}} design and sizing and {{on how to}} assemble the deformation apparatus. One-time jobs Bending of metal plates: they must be bent at one side {{so that they can}} be screwed to both the fixed and moving vertical walls. 3 - 4 holes must be drilled in the 1 ” wide bend to ensure following proper installation. Metal plates must be reinstalled at the beginning of each experiment: Screw mount supports: they must be glued and screwed to the lateral wall to ensure stability while cranking. 1 _ ” flat head screws are suitable for this: Collars: they must be screwed to the head screw mount: Nut for lead screw: it must be installed on one of the horizontal bars behind the moving wall. The anti-tilting bar (see apparatus design) can be added now and also glued to the moving wall. The two bars must be fastened to each other for maximum stability. !! All the mounting parts (thread inserts, <b>screws,</b> <b>collars,</b> nuts, lead <b>screw</b> will be provided to teachers from each school).

50|$|A stand (of drill pipe) is two {{or three}} joints of drill pipe {{connected}} {{and stood in the}} derrick vertically, usually while tripping pipe. A stand of collars is similar, only made up of collars and a collar head. The <b>collar</b> head is <b>screwed</b> into the <b>collar</b> to allow it to be picked up by the elevators.|$|R
5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the strong room for three weeks wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), thumb <b>screws,</b> iron <b>collar,</b> leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the swelling in his legs was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|R
50|$|Clamp-style shaft collars are {{designed}} {{to solve the problems}} associated with the set-screw collar. They come in one- and two-piece designs. Instead of protruding into the shaft, the screws act to compress the collar and lock it into place. The ease of use is maintained with this design and there is no shaft damage. Since the <b>screws</b> compress the <b>collar,</b> a uniform distribution of force is imposed on the shaft, leading to a holding power that is nearly twice that of set-screw collars.|$|R
5000|$|A {{live axle}} is {{probably}} the most common axle setup used on mini choppers. The [...] "live" [...] term indicates that the axle spins along with the wheel, sprocket, and other pieces anchored to the axle. Since the axle spins, bearings are mounted to the swing arm frame. This is a very simple axle setup, and components are relatively easy to change. Each piece, such as wheel hub, disc brake rotor, sprocket, etc., are slid onto the axle and are held in place by set <b>screws</b> or locking <b>collars.</b> The components can also be separated by bushings that are cut to the desired length. Since the axle spins, the wheel, brake, and sprocket components must be locked to the axle. This is accomplished by using a square key that fits into a groove on the axle and the components.|$|R
