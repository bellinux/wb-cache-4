50|$|Most modern pumps have an auto cut-off {{feature that}} stops the flow when the tank is full. This {{is done with}} a second tube, the <b>sensing</b> <b>tube,</b> that runs from just inside {{the mouth of the}} nozzle up to a Venturi pump in the pump handle. A {{mechanical}} valve in the pump handle detects this change of pressure and closes, preventing the flow of fuel.|$|E
50|$|In {{anterior}} rhinomanometry, {{the patient}} is asked to blow his nose, sit in an upright position, and the pressure <b>sensing</b> <b>tube</b> is placed in one nostril while the contralateral nostril is left opened. The patient places a mask which {{is connected to the}} device tightly onto his face. Unilateral measurements are performed to detect any asymmetry or abnormality in nasal airway resistance. When the measurements are performed before and after the application of a nasal decongestant spray, the differences in resistance can be attributed to nasal mucosal congestion. If there is no significant improvement after decongestant, anatomical abnormality, like deformity of cartilage or bone within nasal cavity is suspected. However, such measurements allow only to detect in which side of the nose there is obstruction, not the location within the nasal cavity, which can be detected by acoustic rhinometry or endoscopy. Anterior rhinomanometry is more commonly used and it is often recommended for its easy technique. However, it should be stressed that controlled ambient temperature and humidity, tight seal of the facial mask, contralateral nostril closure and prevention of mouth breathing are essential for reproducible results. Patients' complaints of nasal obstruction are not always confirmed by these objective measurements. Posterior rhinomanometry should be done by more experienced technicians and very good collaboration of {{the patient is}} essential.|$|E

40|$|Water flows uniformly along a <b>tube,</b> with <b>sensing</b> <b>tubes</b> {{connected}} {{along the}} flow tube at equal intervals, {{as shown in}} Figure 1. The height to which the water rises in the <b>sensing</b> <b>tubes</b> {{is a measure of}} the pressure in the tube at those points. The pressure decreases uniformly along the tube, as can be seen on the video and in Figure 1. A faster flow creates a larger pressure differential along the tube, but the pressure drop is still uniform along the length of the tube...|$|R
50|$|Catheters, in this <b>sense,</b> are <b>tubes</b> that drain urine {{from the}} body. A Foley catheter, used {{with men and}} women, is {{inserted}} into the bladder.

In the US, while Foley catheters can only be applied by a nurse or physician, external catheters can be attached by a certified nurse assistant.|$|R
60|$|The fifth nerve, has, in the dog-fish, {{as in the}} rabbit, three chief branches. V.2 and V.3 {{fork over}} the mouth {{just as they do}} in the mammal; V.1 passes out of the cranium by a {{separate}} and more dorsal opening, and runs along a groove along the dorsal internal wall of the orbit, immediately beneath a similar branch of VII., which is not distinct in the rabbit. The grooves are shown in the figure of the cranium, Sheet 18; the joint nerve thus compounded of V. and VII. is called the ophthalmic (oph.). It is distributed to the skin above the nose and orbit. When the student commences to dissect the head of a dog-fish he notices over the dorsal surface of the snout an exudation of a yellowish jelly-like substance, and on removing the tough skin over this region and over the centre of the skull he finds, lying beneath it, a quantity of coiling simple tubuli full of such yellowish matter. These tubuli open on the surface by small pores, and the nerves terminate in hair-like extremities in their lining. These <b>sense</b> <b>tubes</b> are peculiar to aquatic forms; allied structures are found over the head and along a lateral line (see below) in the tadpole, but when the frog emerges from the water they are lost. They, doubtless, indicate some unknown sense entirely beyond our experience, and either only possible or only necessary when the animal is submerged.|$|R
40|$|A {{detector}} of {{ultraviolet radiation}} for operation {{in a space}} vehicle which orbits through high intensity radiation areas is described. Two identical ultraviolet sensor tubes are mounted within a shield which limits to acceptable levels the amount of proton radiation reaching the sensor tubes. The shield has an opening which permits ultraviolet radiation to reach one of the sensing tubes. The shield keeps ultraviolet radiation from reaching the other sensor tube, designated the reference tube. The circuitry of the detector subtracts {{the output of the}} reference tube from the output of the <b>sensing</b> <b>tube,</b> and any portion of the output of the <b>sensing</b> <b>tube</b> which is due to proton radiation is offset by the output of the reference tube. A delay circuit in the detector prevents false alarms by keeping statistical variations in the proton radiation sensed by the two sensor tubes from developing an output signal...|$|E
40|$|Water flows along a {{tube with}} a {{constriction}} near its center, {{as shown in}} Figure 1. Because the water flows faster in {{the section of the}} tube with a smaller radius, the pressure in that region is reduced, as indicated by the water in the attached sensing tubes.

40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{evaluating}} traditional computational leak detection technologies pipeline operators have a suite of simulated testing methods available. In {{the last several years}} however External Leak Detection Technologies have become more mature and potentially could provide operators with another layer of leak detection with more sensitivity than seen in traditional methods. The challenge with these technologies is in the evaluation of their sensitivity, reliability, and robustness. ENBRIDGE INC (Enbridge) and C-FER Technologies 1999 Inc. (C-FER) begun a comprehensive study to assess the state-of-the-art external, continuously distributed sensors for leak detection in early 2012. Initially, a technology review was undertaken to identify commercial, off-the-shelf technologies with the potential to detect small leaks of oil from buried pipelines. From this literature review, four technologies were identified; Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS), Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS), Vapor <b>Sensing</b> <b>Tubes</b> (VST), and Hydrocarbon Sensing Cables (HSC). All four methods require proprietary materials and technology, which have had limited independent testing efforts to date. To evaluate these four leak detection methods and their vendors in an objective way, Enbridge and C-FER initiated the design and construction of a large-scale External Leak Detection Experimental Research apparatus (ELDER) that can accommodate a full-size segment of pipeline within a trench, at the same scale used in pipeline construction in North America. An instrumented pipe segment is buried in the trench with sensing cables laid alongside. The apparatus generates leaks with controlled variables including rate, pressure and temperature, and at various locations to accurately represent pipeline leaks. This paper summarizes the literature review on the four selected leak detection technologies that were identified as candidates for large-scale evaluation. The discussion will also include features of the ELDER apparatus, and re-engineered pipeline construction techniques that were required to accurately represent a full-scale pipeline trench within a laboratory environment.

50|$|This greatly {{expanded}} {{the opportunities for}} senior archaeology students to do MA thesis research based on more than visits {{to the library and}} minor projects of fieldwork. Provision was made in the new laboratory complex for student projects in archaeological remote <b>sensing,</b> transmission <b>tube</b> XRF analysis, radioactive source excitation XRF, and thermoluminescence analysis. Leach formed strong links with various external laboratories, which enabled students to take advantage of scientific facilities at the then Institute of Nuclear Sciences accelerator group, the Otago Department of Chemistry facility for Electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR), and the Lucas Heights Nuclear Physics Laboratory. He encouraged his students to publish their archaeometry projects, often jointly with the senior scientists whose external facilities were being used. Student projects that survived the rigours of publishing covered a wide range of topics from accelerator depth profile dating of bones and teeth, seasonal dating of shells using oxygen isotopes, experimental archaeology, thermoluminescence dating of oven stones, physical analysis of pottery, trace element analysis of obsidian sources with XRF, dating of human bone with ESR, and diet reconstruction from atomic absorption spectroscopy of human bone.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted at}} Mach numbers of 1. 41, 1. 83, and 2. 20 {{to determine the effects}} of parametric variations both in the height of the pitot-tube center line from the probe surface, by varying the pitot-tube diameter, and in the radius of surface curvature on the pressure recovery of a probe designed to measure free-stream stagnation pressure. The probe consists of a pitot tube mounted on the surface of a curved cylinder of circular cross section; the pitot <b>tube</b> <b>senses</b> the pressure of the stream tube which has been slowed to subsonic or near sonic velocity by isentropic compression along the curved surface. Pressure recovery - greater than or equal to 99. 8 percent of free-stream stagnation pressure - was obtained for a wide range of both angle of attack and yaw for probes satisfying the optimum design criteria determined in this investigation...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the design and}} fabrication of an in-line evanescent field gas sensor based on a novel suspended ring-core photonic crystal fiber (PCF) to further overcome limitations in sensing capability. The suspended ring-core PCF is made by the stack-and-draw technique with a large central capillary of ~ 60 µm and adapted small capillaries in a larger cladding <b>tube.</b> <b>Sensing</b> capabilities of two variations of the proposed suspended ring-core PCFs were investigated experimentally by detecting absorption lines of acetylene gas. The sensitivity of the two PCF structures was also numerically analyzed using a full-vectorial finite-element method. The dynamic response of the sensors was quantified in detail. The results demonstrated significant improvement in both sensitivity and response time of the suspended ring-core PCF as this special PCF can provide larger gas diffusion and higher overlap between the sensing species and the guided light than either a Ge-doped ring defect PCF or a conventional index-guided PCF...|$|R
40|$|Catheters and shunts are tubes {{which are}} used to manage the flow of fluids into, within, {{and out of the}} body. Intravascular (IV) {{catheters}} deliver fluids and medications directly into the bloodstream, while urinary catheters drain waste fluids. In some cases devices such as cerebral ventricular shunts drain fluid from the brain, {{to another part of the}} body, such as the heart or stomach where the fluids are processed internally. There are numerous indications for catheter use in a wide variety of anatomic sites and for treating many chronic diseases. Urinary or IV catheters might be placed for a few hours for patient management during a surgical procedure, radiological scan during a surgical procedure, or during an imaging examination. Some catheters may have an anticipated lifetime of months or years in certain patients. Catheters can be transcutaneous, where by definition, they breach the protective skin barrier (i. e. IV catheters and external ventricular drains), be inserted into natural orifices (i. e. urinary and nasogastric catheters) or be completely indwelling (i. e. cerebral ventricular shunts). In the broadest <b>sense,</b> endotracheal <b>tubes</b> and ear tubes might be considered catheters since they are tubes designed to facilitate the transport of fluids (air or liquid) into and out of the body. Some of the more common catheters are listed in Table 1. In addition to catheters, stents and cannulae are also often used for the transport of fluids into and out of the body. A stent is a 'tube' inserted into a vessel or other conduit in the body to prevent or treat stenosis, or constriction e. g. of a vessel, esophagus or ductus choledocus...|$|R
40|$|Although {{classical}} electrostatic plasma probes {{can provide}} detailed information regarding electrons and ions, these devices rely on charge-carrying particles both for energy filtering and for detection. Neutral particles are transparent to such diagnostics. In {{light of this}} a new probe design was developed to provide a measurement of the neutral particle flux component of a flowing plasma. The simple design adopted for this probe utilizes a set of electrostatic retarding grids to remove the charged particles from the flow. The neutral particles are <b>sensed</b> within the <b>tube</b> of an off-the-shelf hot cathode ionization gauge. Additionally, by varying the potential on the retarding grids, this same probe configuration {{can be used to}} measure the ion energy distribution. Preliminary data from this probe were taken in the exhaust plume of a Hall-current accelerator designed for space propulsion. This probe was found to be a very simple, accurate diagnostic tool for such use. By using this probe in combination with interrelated diagnostics the spatial distribution of energetic charge exchange neutrals was quantified in the plume of an SPT- 100 thruster. © 1997 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
50|$|Nano-scaffolding is very small, 100 times {{smaller than}} the human hair and is built out of {{biodegradable}} fibers. The use of this scaffolding allows more effective use of stem cells and quicker regeneration. Electrospun nanofibers are prepared using microscopic tubes that range between 100 and 200 nanometers in diameter. These entangle {{with each other in}} the form of a web as they're produced. Electrospinning allows the construction of these webs to be controlled in the <b>sense</b> of the <b>tube's</b> diameter, thickness, and the material being used. Nano-scaffolding is placed into the body at the site where the regeneration process will occur. Once injected, stem cells are added to the scaffolding. Stem cells that are attached to a scaffold are shown to be more successful in adapting to their environment and performing the task of regeneration. The nerve ends in the body will attach to the scaffolding by weaving in-between the openings. This will cause them to act as a bridge to connect severed sections. Over time the scaffolding will dissolve and safely exit the body leaving healthy nerves in its place.|$|R
50|$|The cell uses {{conventional}} piston and cylinder arrangement. The piston {{is placed}} in a thin elastic diaphragm. The piston doesn't actually {{come in contact with}} the load cell. Mechanical stops are placed to prevent over strain of the diaphragm when the loads exceed certain limit. The load cell is completely filled with oil. When the load is applied on the piston, the movement of the piston and the diaphragm results in an increase of oil pressure. This pressure is then transmitted to a hydraulic pressure gauge via a high pressure hose. The gauge's Bourdon <b>tube</b> <b>senses</b> the pressure and registers it on the dial. Because this sensor has no electrical components, it is ideal for use in hazardous areas. Typical hydraulic load cell applications include tank, bin, and hopper weighing. By example, a hydraulic load cell is immune to transient voltages (lightning) so these type of load cells might be a more effective device in outdoor environments. This technology is more expensive than other types of load cells. It is a more costly technology and thus cannot effectively compete on a cost of purchase basis.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to produce a finned tube constructed of a highly conductive braided graphite fiber preform infiltrated with a copper matrix. In addition, the tube was to be fabricated with an integral geometry. The preform was integral in the <b>sense</b> that the <b>tube</b> and the fin could be braided to yield one continuous part. This composite component is a candidate for situations with high heat transmitting and radiation requirements. A proof-of-concept finned tube was braided and infiltrated with a copper matrix proving that a viable process was developed to fabricate the desired component. Braiding of high conductivity carbon fibers required much trial-and-error and development of special procedures. There are many tradeoffs between braidability and fiber conductivity. To understand the properties and structure of the braided finned tube, an geometric model of the braid structure was derived. This derivation set the basis for the research because knowing the tow orientations helped decipher the thermal as well as the mechanical and conduction tendencies. Infiltration of the fibers into a copper matrix was a complex procedure, and was performed by TRA, of Salt Lake City, Utah, using a proprietary process. Several batches were fabricated with a final, high quality batch serving as a confirming proof-of-concept...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Plant {{biologists}} have long speculated about the mechanisms that guide pollen tubes to ovules. Although {{there is now}} evidence that ovules emit a diffusible attractant, {{little is known about}} how this attractant mediates interactions between the pollen tube and the ovules. Results We employ a semi- in vitro assay, in which ovules dissected from Arabidopsis thaliana are arranged around a cut style on artificial medium, to elucidate how ovules release the attractant and how pollen tubes respond to it. Analysis of microscopy images of the semi- in vitro system shows that pollen tubes are more attracted to ovules that are incubated on the medium for longer times before pollen tubes emerge from the cut style. The responses of tubes are consistent with their sensing a gradient of an attractant at 100 - 150 μ m, farther than previously reported. Our microscopy images also show that pollen tubes slow their growth near the micropyles of functional ovules with a spatial range that depends on ovule incubation time. Conclusions We propose a stochastic model that captures these dynamics. In the model, a pollen <b>tube</b> <b>senses</b> a difference in the fraction of receptors bound to an attractant and changes its direction of growth in response; the attractant is continuously released from ovules and spreads isotropically on the medium. The model suggests that the observed slowing greatly enhances the ability of pollen tubes to successfully target ovules. The relation of the results to guidance in vivo is discussed. </p...|$|R
