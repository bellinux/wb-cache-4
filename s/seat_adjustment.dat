This was $8,000-$11,000 higher than any previous Subaru. A rear spoiler was optional on the 1992 L and LS-L models and was included as standard equipment beginning in 1993. There was a brief XR model in 1992 that was made on the first production run that included the spoiler standard but put the vehicle over the import weight limit. As a result, the spoiler was shipped separately. On the other hand, it was almost $5,000 lower than a comparable four wheel drive Dodge Stealth R/T/Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4, though with almost 100 additional horsepower, the Stealth/3000GT twins were much faster and more technologically advanced.

40|$|Technique {{and energy}} saving are two {{variables}} often considered {{as important for}} performance in cycling and related to each other. Theoretically, excellent pedalling technique should give high gross efficiency (GE). The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the relationship between pedalling technique and GE. 10 well-trained cyclists were measured for GE, force effectiveness (FE) and dead centre size (DC) at a work rate corresponding to ~ 75 % of VO 2 max during level and inclined cycling, seat adjusted forward and backward, at three different cadences around their own freely chosen cadence (FCC) on an ergometer. Within subjects, FE, DC and GE decreased as cadence increased (p <  0. 001). A strong relationship between FE and GE was found, which was to great extent explained by FCC. The relationship between cadence and both FE and GE, within and between subjects, was very similar, irrespective of FCC. There was no difference between level and inclined cycling position. The <b>seat</b> <b>adjustments</b> did not affect FE, DC and GE or the relationship between them. Energy expenditure is strongly coupled to cadence, but force effectiveness, as a measure for pedalling technique, is not likely the cause of this relationship. FE, DC and GE are not affected by body orientation or <b>seat</b> <b>adjustments,</b> indicating that these parameters and the relationship between them are robust to coordinative challenges within a range of cadence, body orientation and seat position that is used in regular cycling...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: The {{purposes}} of this study are twofold: First, to recommend a range of angles for driving posture comfort from measurement of participants and second, to investigate the relationships between drivers' anthropometric characteristics, comfortable postural angles and <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Approach: Forty five participants were involved in the study. Both anthropometric data and postural angles were measured and recorded by using the photographic technique and analyzed further using software. During the study, each participant was required to sit on the driver's seat in his or her preferred comfortable driving postures. Images of the participant's driving posture were taken after 5 min he or she has been in the driving position to allow him/her to adapt with the seat environment and fabrics. The <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> data were measured manually after the seat is adjusted for comfort by the participant. Prior to that, 10 anthropometric data of each participant was measured and recorded. Data on comfortable driving postural angles, anthropometry and <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> were analyzed statistically with Pearson correlation using the SPSS software. Results: From the study, a range of angles are proposed based on the participant's perception on comfort. The ranges of comfortable angles for Malaysian citizen proposed shows significant different between Caucasian and Korean populations. The relationships between the comfortable postural angles, anthropometric data and <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> were analyzed and discussed with several outcome shows that taller participants preferred a driving posture with their arms outstretched in order to achieve comfort, participants with bigger body dimension have a tendency to sit farther back from the steering wheels and smaller participants prefer to sit closer to the steering wheels with a slightly greater trunk thigh angle. Conclusion: The result obtained and discussed in this study can be applied in the driver's car seat design and construction to ensure comfort and safety...|$|E
40|$|A {{wheelchair}} user makes {{direct contact}} with the wheelchair seat, which serves as the interface between the user and the wheelchair, for much of any given day. <b>Seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> design is of crucial importance in providing proper seating posture and comfort. This paper presents a multiple-DOF (degrees of freedom) <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism, which is intended to increase the independence of the wheelchair user while maintaining a concise structure, light weight, and intuitive control interface. This four-axis Stewart platform is capable of heaving, pitching, and swaying to provide seat elevation, tilt-in-space, and sideways movement functions. The geometry and types of joints of this mechanism are carefully arranged so that only one actuator needs to be controlled, enabling the wheelchair user to adjust the seat by simply pressing a button. The seat is also equipped with soft pressure-sensing pads to provide pressure management by adjusting the seat mechanism once continuous and concentrated pressure is detected. Finally, by comparing with the manual wheelchair, the proposed mechanism demonstrated the easier and more convenient operation with less effort for transfer assistance...|$|E

50|$|Finally, the <b>adjustment</b> <b>seats</b> {{that each}} party has {{received}} are distributed among the districts. The {{application of the}} Sainte-Laguë number gives each party a quotient ('comparison number', jämförelsetal) in each district, which is its number of votes in the district divided by (2n+1), where n {{is the amount of}} seats it has been awarded. The district where the party has the highest quotient is awarded an <b>adjustment</b> <b>seat,</b> and a new quotient is then calculated for that district, before the next <b>adjustment</b> <b>seat</b> is distributed. In theory, a district can thus receive more than one <b>adjustment</b> <b>seat.</b> If a party is yet to receive a seat in the district, its quotient simply is the amount of votes it received. When the fixed seats were distributed among the parties in the district, this number was divided by 1.4, which made it harder for a party to achieve its first seat. Now, however, no such division takes place. The method used is thus pure and not modified Sainte-Laguë.|$|R
