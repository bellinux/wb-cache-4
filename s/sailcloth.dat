5|$|During the Industrial Revolution, Arbroath's economy {{expanded}} {{and the population}} of the town expanded, with new housing having to be constructed to house the influx of workers. Arbroath became moderately well known for jute and <b>sailcloth</b> production, with 34 mills employing 1,400 looms and producing over one million yards of osnaburg cloth and 450,000yards of <b>sailcloth</b> in 1875. Arbroath {{is believed to be the}} source of the sails used on the Cutty Sark. In 1867, the mills in Arbroath employed 4,620 people. Arbroath was also prominent in the manufacture of shoes and lawnmowers; local firm Alexander Shanks supplied mowers to the Old Course at St Andrews and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath's {{prospects}} originally {{revolved around}} the harbour. The original harbour was constructed and maintained by the abbot within the terms of an agreement between the burgesses and John Gedy, the abbot in 1394 AD. This {{gave way to a}} more commodious port in 1725, which in turn was enlarged and improved in 1839, when the sea wall, quay walls and breakwater were added to the old inner harbour, at a cost of £58,000. Arbroath became a major port for the coastal shipping trade and in 1846, there were 89 Arbroath registered vessels, totalling 9,100 gross tons. In the same year, 599 vessels docked at Arbroath, 56 from foreign ports (mainly Baltic ports) with the remaining 543 employed on the coastal trade. Bark, flax, hemp, hides, oak and fir timber, and guano for manure, groceries from London, and numerous articles of Baltic produce were imported via Arbroath, with manufactured goods (mainly <b>sailcloth)</b> exported via Arbroath.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution, Scotland {{became one}} of the {{commercial}} and industrial centres of the British Empire. With tariffs with England now abolished, the potential for trade for Scottish merchants was considerable, especially with Colonial America. However, the economic benefits of union were very slow to appear, primarily because Scotland was too poor to exploit the opportunities of the greatly expanded free market. Scotland in 1750 was still a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3million. Some progress was visible, such as the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow after 1740. The clippers belonging to the Glasgow Tobacco Lords were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia. Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, <b>sailcloth,</b> glassworks, breweries, and soapworks, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial centre after 1815. The tobacco trade collapsed during the American Revolution (1776–83), when it sources were cut off by the British blockade of American ports. However, trade with the West Indies began {{to make up for the}} loss of the tobacco business, reflecting the extensive growth of the cotton industry, the British demand for sugar and the demand in the West Indies for herring and linen goods. During 1750–1815, 78 Glasgow merchants not only specialised in the importation of sugar, cotton, and rum from the West Indies, but diversified their interests by purchasing West Indian plantations, Scottish estates, or cotton mills. They were not to be self-perpetuating due to the hazards of the trade, the incident of bankruptcy, and the changing complexity of Glasgow's economy.|$|E
25|$|Common sails {{consist of}} a lattice {{framework}} on which a <b>sailcloth</b> is spread. The miller can adjust the amount of cloth spread according {{to the amount of}} wind available and power needed. In medieval mills, the <b>sailcloth</b> was wound {{in and out of a}} ladder type arrangement of sails. Postmedieval mill sails had a lattice framework over which the <b>sailcloth</b> was spread, while in colder climates, the cloth was replaced by wooden slats, which were easier to handle in freezing conditions. The jib sail is commonly found in Mediterranean countries, and consists of a simple triangle of cloth wound round a spar.|$|E

25|$|The series {{all share}} similar {{construction}} featuring a bolted aluminium tube structure with the flying surfaces covered in pre-sewn Dacron <b>sailcloth</b> envelopes. All models are open-cockpit, but some have optional streamlined pods available. All models use {{tricycle landing gear}} and steerable nosewheels.|$|E
25|$|The Eagle design sold {{in large}} numbers, but {{suffered}} many wing failures {{that resulted in}} several fatalities {{as a result of}} the deterioration of the unreinforced Dacron <b>sailcloth</b> trailing edge design. The lawsuits, {{as a result of the}} design defects, put the company out of business in about 1984, just as the market for ultralight aircraft in the United States collapsed.|$|E
25|$|Sir John Call {{argued the}} {{advantages}} of Norfolk Island {{in that it was}} uninhabited and that New Zealand flax grew there. In 1786 the British government included Norfolk Island as an auxiliary settlement, as proposed by John Call, in its plan for colonisation of New South Wales. The decision to settle Norfolk Island was taken due to Empress Catherine II of Russia's decision to restrict sales of hemp. Practically all the hemp and flax required by the Royal Navy for cordage and <b>sailcloth</b> was imported from Russia.|$|E
25|$|Gaskell {{was born}} in Latchford, a suburb of Warrington, the eldest of six children. The Gaskell family were {{prominent}} Dissenters. His father, also William, was a <b>sailcloth</b> manufacturer with a business on Buttermarket Street and also a Unitarian theology teacher; according to one source, his mother, Margaret Jackson, was a housemaid. He was tutored by a local minister, Joseph Saul. Barred as a non-conformist from attending Oxford or Cambridge, Gaskell studied at Glasgow University (1820–25), taking his BA and MA in 1825. He then trained for the Unitarian ministry at Manchester New College (1825–28), at that time located in York, where his tutors included Charles Wellbeloved and James Turner.|$|E
25|$|The ship's crew {{transferred}} to Garden Key, taking {{food and water}} with them. A rumor spread among the men that, since the ship was wrecked and they were on dry land, they were free of naval discipline. Captain Herbert told the men {{that they were still}} under naval authority, and that all needed to work together to save themselves. A camp was established on the island, using <b>sailcloth</b> for tents to shelter men and supplies. On 18 January, the ship's longboat, with nine men, sailed for New Providence in the Bahamas to seek help for the stranded crew. The voyage was expected to be short, as the officers still believed they had wrecked on the Reques Keys, in the Bahamas.|$|E
25|$|With tariffs with England now abolished, the {{potential}} for trade for Scottish merchants was considerable. However, Scotland in 1750 was still a poor rural, agricultural society {{with a population of}} 1.3 million. Some progress was visible: agriculture in the Lowlands was steadily upgraded after 1700 and standards remained high. there were the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow Tobacco Lords after 1740.

25|$|The East Room {{was among}} the last rooms on the State Floor to be {{completed}} and used. The White House was unfinished when President John Adams occupied it between 1800 and 1801. His wife, Abigail Adams, hung laundry in the bare East Room to dry. Although much of the White House was finished and decorated during Adams administration, the East Room was not. The room's lone artwork was {{a copy of the}} Lansdowne portrait depicting George Washington, painted by Gilbert Stuart in 1797. It was purchased by the White House in 1800, and hung in the East Room. (Rescued from the 1814 fire, it still hangs there, with a companion portrait of Martha Washington painted by Eliphalet Frazer Andrews in 1878.) There was extensive feeling in Congress that Adams had adopted too many of the trappings of monarchy, and Congress declined to appropriate funds to finish the room for fear it would look too much like a throne room. During the Jefferson administration, 38 gold-and-black painted chairs were purchased and placed in the room, but little else is known of the room's furnishings prior to 1814. Jefferson also had the East Room partitioned (using canvas and <b>sailcloth</b> for walls) and the southern end used for a bedroom and office for Meriwether Lewis and Lewis Harvie (both Private Secretary to the President).|$|E
500|$|... "E. Weston & Son" [...] {{became a}} diverse {{operation}} {{which included a}} large ropewalk on Weston's property on Powder Point. The 1,000 foot long structure produced cordage for Weston vessels and became a lucrative component of the enterprise as the Westons supplied rigging to all of Duxbury's major shipbuilders as well as shipyards in Boston. In 1812, the Westons built a <b>sailcloth</b> mill in the Millbrook section of Duxbury. They owned a blacksmith shop and tar kiln and employed a large workforce of carpenters, laborers, stevedores and mariners. Thus the Westons were able to supply virtually all their own raw material needed to build sailing vessels. The Westons built numerous smaller vessels, including [...] schooners for fishing and coastal trade. However, Weston's best known vessels were large brigs and ships which traded primarily in the northern Atlantic and Mediterranean.|$|E
