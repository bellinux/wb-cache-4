5|$|The Paradigm {{system allows}} the player to program six {{different}} roles, which the characters can assume to perform certain formations in battle {{in response to}} specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, which uses non-elemental attacks to stabilize the Chain Gauge; Ravager, which uses elemental attacks to fill the Chain Gauge; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal the party; Saboteur, which can weaken enemies; <b>Synergist,</b> which can strengthen allies; and Sentinel, which has protective abilities. The two main characters can initially assume three roles, but they can learn others at the player's choosing as the game progresses. The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters use while outside or during battle, {{which is the only}} way that the player can control the AI characters during a fight. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up before the battle. Monsters only have one role; different ones are used when the player switches paradigms. The player selects up to three monsters they wish to use in paradigms outside of battle. Unlike in Final Fantasy XIII, the player cannot summon the Eidolons, as the giant creatures were only available to the protagonists of that game.|$|E
5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} chain counter, {{consisting}} of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Attacks by different roles have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the chain counter resets. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy is placed into Stagger State. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air. The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, a warrior-type role; Ravager, a black mage-type role which uses damage-dealing magic; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal and remove negative status ailments; Saboteur, which uses magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses; <b>Synergist,</b> which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses; and Sentinel, which has protective and defensive abilities similar to a paladin. Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles, but the player has access to all of them later in the game (although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them). The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle, which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during battle. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle.|$|E

40|$|<b>Synergists</b> are {{commonly}} used in combination with pesticides to suppress metabolism-based resistance and increase {{the efficacy of the}} agents. They are also useful as tools for laboratory investigation of specific resistance mechanisms based on their ability to inhibit specific metabolic pathways. To determine the role of metabolic degradation as a mechanism for acaricide resistance in human scabies, PBO (piperonyl butoxide), DEF (S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate) and DEM (diethyl maleate) were used with permethrin as <b>synergists</b> in a bioassay of mite killing. A statistically significant difference in survival time of permethrin-resistant Sarcoptes scabiei variety canis was noted when any of the three <b>synergists</b> were used in combination with permethrin compared to survival time of mites exposed to permethrin alone (p< 0. 0001). These results indicate the potential utility of <b>synergists</b> in reversing tolerance to pyrethroid-based acaricides (i. e. the addition of <b>synergists</b> to permethrin-containing topical acaricide cream commonly used to treat scabies). To further verify specific metabolic pathways being inhibited by these <b>synergists,</b> enzyme assays were developed to measure esterase, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase activity in scabies mites. Results of in vitro enzyme inhibition experiments showed lower levels of esterase activity with DEF; lower levels of GST activity with DEM and lower levels of cytochrome monooxygenase activity with PBO.

25|$|Due to {{the level}} of damage an {{infestation}} can result in, much has been done over the years in the effort to manage, reduce, and eliminate the horn fly. Traditional methods were through the use of pour-ons, backrubbers and face powder bags, with products such as Co-Ral which is available as dust for face/horn flies. Self-applicator methods such as dust bags and backrubbers are used mainly for range or pasture herds, and are placed so that the animal cannot avoid coming into contact with it, such as at a gate through which animals pass. More recently, control of the horn fly by using ear tags on cattle has been extremely successful. The ear tags are made of a PVC matrix impregnated with pyrethroid, and can be effective for between 16 and 24 weeks. Originally, the ear tags were developed and used against such pests as ticks and by 1983 50% of cattle had ear tags. Long periods of such dosing resulted in the elimination of 95-99% of susceptible flies, but this strong selective pressure ended up resulting in the development of resistant strains of the flies. To combat this, the use of organophosphates and piperonyl butoxide as a <b>synergist</b> are now recommended to be alternated with pyrethroid to help slow resistance. In addition, methoprene in the form of sustained release bolus (a rounded mass of food or pharmaceutical preparation ready to swallow) inhibits the emergence of an adult insect from a pupal case or an insect larva from an egg for up to 7 months.|$|E

For {{the development of}} more effective and less toxic retinoids, gene expression analyses using DNA microarrays have the potential to supplement conventional screening methods, which are based on the changes in cell morphology and/or function. In this study, we applied the class prediction algorithm, which was used in the molecular phenotyping of tumors, for the classification of synthetic retinoids (Am 80 and Tp 80) and retinoid <b>synergists</b> (HX 630, TZ 335, and PA 024) as all-trans retinoic acid-like, 9 -cis retinoic acid-like, and control-like classes. By analyzing the effects of all-trans retinoic acid and 9 -cis retinoic acid on the gene expressions in a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL 60, we successfully selected 50 marker genes whose expression pattern could distinguish these classes. Moreover, the classification revealed the existence of two subclasses among the retinoid <b>synergists</b> used with Am 80. Close inspection of the DNA microarray analyses indicated that these two subclasses had different effects on the apoptosis of HL 60 cells, and this was confirmed by in vivo experiments. These results indicate that the retinoidal activity of Am 80, which has already been used in clinical trials, could be modulated differently by the two classes of retinoid <b>synergists.</b> Thus, these two subclasses of retinoid <b>synergists</b> have the potency to widen the usage of Am 80.

40|$|The basic {{locomotor}} rhythm in the cat {{is generated}} by a neuronal network in the spinal cord. The exact organization of this network and its drive to the spinal motoneurones is unknown. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to use time (cumulant density) and frequency domain (coherence) analysis to examine the organization of the last order drive to motoneurones during fictive locomotion (evoked by application of nialamide and dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)) in the spinal cat. In all cats, narrow central synchronization peaks (half-width < 3 ms) were observed in cumulants estimated between electroneurograms (ENGs) of close <b>synergists,</b> but not between nerves belonging to muscles acting on different joints or to antagonistic muscles. Coherence was not observed at frequencies above 100 Hz and was mainly observed between <b>synergists.</b> Intracellular recording was obtained from a population of 70 lumbar motoneurones. Significant short-term synchronization was observed between the individual intracellular recordings and the ENGs recorded from nerves of the same pool and of close <b>synergists.</b> Recordings from 34 pairs of motoneurones (10 pairs belonged to the same motor pool, 11 pairs to close <b>synergists</b> and 13 pairs to antagonistic pools) failed to reveal any short-lasting synchronization. These data demonstrate that short-term synchronization during fictive locomotion is relatively weak and is restricted to close <b>synergists.</b> In addition, coherence analysis failed to identify any specific rhythmic component in the locomotor drive that could be associated with this synchronization. These results resemble findings obtained during human treadmill walking and imply that the spinal interneurones participating in the generation of the locomotor rhythm are themselves weakly synchronized. The restricted synchronization within the locomotor drive to motoneuronal pools may be a feature of the locomotor generating networks that is related to the ability of these networks to produce highly adaptive patterns of muscle activity during locomotion. ...|$|R
