5|$|Animals {{and birds}} {{associated}} with C.australis include lizards which forage among the flowers, including the gold-striped gecko which is well camouflaged for life among {{the leaves of}} the tree. New Zealand bellbirds like to nest under the dead leaves or among the flower stalks, and paradise shelducks commonly build their nests in the base of an old cabbage tree <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> a field. Red-crowned parakeets are often seen foraging in cabbage trees. In South Canterbury, long-tailed bats shelter during the day in the hollow branches, which would once have provided nesting holes for many birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} opens with shots of Rihanna hooded, {{lying on the}} floor of a gas chamber. Three men, dressed in black uniforms and wearing dark round glasses {{circulate}} around the singer, attempting to extort information from her. The scene then moves to a dimly lit room in which Rihanna sits at a table with her love interest (played by American actor Jesse Williams) opposite. On the table between them lies a silver revolver in which, throughout the video, they take it turns holding to their heads. Other scenes include Rihanna in a woodland at night <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> a highway before a car speeds towards her, quickly cutting to another scene, giving the impression she is run over. Elements of blood and tears and vehicular assault dominate the video. In the final scenes, Rihanna is shown underwater, floating whilst being fired at; one bullet is visually seen cutting her throat. The video ends with her lover apparently committing suicide with the revolver placed between them.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the video features Jay Z as a passenger in a car speeding along Mission Road in Los Angeles, where he encounters Beyoncé, <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the road, at the Fourth Street bridge. Beyoncé performs in various dance sequences, beginning with her wearing a white tank top, denim blue shorts, and red high-heels. She performs an elaborate solo dance on a riser. The scene shifts to a gold set with a mock photo shoot, before moving into a scene with dancers detailing Beyoncé and dancing against a wall while wearing caps and full length pants. Jay Z appears and ignites a line of petrol leading to a car parked under the bridge, which explodes in flames. Jay Z performs his rap {{in front of the}} burning car, and Beyoncé dances beside him, wearing an exotic silk print over a fur coat, before kicking the valve off a fire hydrant. She continues to dance while the water is flying everywhere. The video ends with Beyoncé and her dancers wearing vibrant Versace dresses in front of a large fan. Their outfits contrast with the neutral colors of the background, the video. Carmit Bachar, a former Pussycat Dolls singer, is one of the dancers.|$|E

The highway intersects Livingston Road again in the center of Accokeek; that highway heads east as MD 373 and west as MD 810J before becoming a county highway. MD 210 intersects Farmington Road and curves north to cross Piscataway Creek. The state highway continues along the eastern edge of Fort Washington, where it intersects Old Fort Road and Swan Creek Road; the latter provides access to Livingston Road, which switches to the west side of the state highway. MD 210 intersects Fort Washington Road, which leads to Fort Washington Park, and Old Fort Road again east of historic Harmony Hall and St. John's Church, which are accessed from Livingston Road. Livingston Road reconnects with MD 210 at Palmer Road, north of which the state highway crosses Henson Creek.|$|E

[...] "Early on, {{we knew it}} was supposed to feel like a nightmare," [...] Miller professed, who commented that early on in the process, Fincher wanted to use an artwork as a template for the sequence. After browsing through various paintings to no avail, Fincher chose a painting that depicted the artist, covered in black paint, <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> a gallery. Many of Miller's sketches contained a liquid-like component, and were rewritten to produce the [...] "gooey" [...] element that was so desired.

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a girl (a young Underwood) {{studying}} at home. Her abusive father arrives and asks her if she needs help. She declines his offer and starts gathering her things to leave the room, however; as she stands up, he grabs her arm. She manages to pull away and leave. Underwood stated that this scene had no script. She and the actor acted it out the way they thought it might have happened. Underwood revealed that she left the filming location with bruises on her arm- [...] "I had finger marks on my arm when I left {{at the end of}} the day, so I was like, 'Wow.' ... It was intense. I wasn't just imagining it, it was really intense." [...] As the video continues, the girl is seen <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> a cemetery, walking around and staring at the clouds as a thunderstorm forms in the sky. She runs back to her house through an old, destroyed yellow-brick road, similar to the one of Wizard of Oz. She enters the house to see her father sleeping on the couch, holding a bottle of alcohol. She sits next to him, recalling the times he let his drunkenness and anger get out of hand. She tries to wake him up but fails. She realizes that he has passed out. She looks through the window and notices the thunderstorm getting worse, so she leaves her father and runs to the cellar alone to protect herself. She's seen lying in an old bed and crying, as she hears the tornado coming closer, with her father still passed out. The next day, there are no traces of the house, and she calmly walks away.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} {{close-up}} shots of several items, including a soft-drink glass, {{a bottle of}} milk, marshmallows, and pages from a briefcase, falling onto the ground. A QR code, which was said to produce the word [...] "LOVE" [...] when scanned, can be seen printed on the glass and bottle, {{and on the ground}} during the scene of the marshmallows falling. In their analysis of the video, Popjustice commented that the falling objects convey an environment of excitement, saying: [...] "the general idea here is that something exciting is happening and someone is so excited by the exciting thing that they have dropped their drink." [...] Several couples are shown removing their clothes, stripping down to their underwear, and proceeding to kiss and caress each other. Minogue then rises up from the inside of a [...] "mountain of writhing bodies" [...] and a flock of doves flies around them. Her attire consists of a black bra, similar to the one Madonna wore in the 1990 music video of [...] "Vogue", wore underneath a [...] "shredded" [...] white top coupled with white go-go boots and knee-pads. She continues singing the song while laying atop the pyramid of couples and changes her position as the song approaches its second verse. A convertible <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> a road is shown releasing a bunch of white balloons from its top. The scene switches back to Minogue, from where the camera pans upward to reveal a large white inflatable elephant floating in between two skyscrapers. The flash mob continues growing in size and the height of the pyramid increases. Minogue sways her hand above the participants of the mob, emphasising rings and jewellery designed by UK-based jeweller Shaun Leane. During of the bridge section of the song, Minogue is pulled inside the pyramid and the lighting is dimmed down. The song's breakdown coincides with scenes of a white horse galloping on a road amid various couples kissing each other. As the chorus begins, Minogue again rises up and stands atop the pyramid, which has greatly increased in height. Popjustice pointed out that the increment in the height of the pyramid is reflective of the lines of the song in which Minogue repeats the word [...] "higher". The camera switches to a distant view of the scene, showing the pyramid in between the skyscrapers and the floating elephant and balloons. The video ends with Minogue realising a dove in the air.|$|E
