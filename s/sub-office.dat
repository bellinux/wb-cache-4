500|$|By 1934, Eichmann {{requested}} {{transfer to}} the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service) of the SS, to escape the [...] "monotony" [...] of military training and service at Dachau. Eichmann was accepted into the SD and assigned to the <b>sub-office</b> on Freemasons, organising seized ritual objects for a proposed museum. After about six months, Eichmann was invited by Leopold von Mildenstein to join his Jewish Department, Section II/112 of the SD, at its Berlin headquarters. Eichmann's transfer was granted in November 1934. He later came to consider this as his big break. He was assigned to study and prepare reports on the Zionist movement and various Jewish organisations. He even learned a smattering of Hebrew and Yiddish, gaining {{a reputation as a}} specialist in Zionist and Jewish matters. On 21 March 1935 Eichmann married Veronika (Vera) Liebl (1909–93). The couple had four sons: Klaus (b. 1936 in Berlin), Horst Adolf (b. 1940 in Vienna), Dieter Helmut (b. 1942 in Prague) and Ricardo Francisco (b. 1955 in Buenos Aires). Eichmann was promoted to SS-Hauptscharführer (head squad leader) in 1936 and was commissioned as an SS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) the following year.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{the town}} of Barrow was {{continuing}} to grow, and this resulted in many commissions for the practice. [...] In {{order to deal with}} this they opened a <b>sub-office</b> in the town, run by John Harrison (1837–96), which continued to exist until the late 1880s. [...] The first major commission in the town was to design a flax and jute mill for James Ramsden (1870–72). [...] Other secular buildings included banks, cemetery buildings (including a large gateway), ten large tenement blocks, schools, villas, meeting halls, and the School of Art. [...] For the Furness Railway they designed stations, goods sheds, workers' cottages and, probably, the circular water tower at Seascale. [...] The partners were also involved with work at large country houses. [...] The most important commission was to build a new wing at Holker Hall in 1871–75 to replace a wing severely damaged by fire; this was the largest project undertaken by the partners. [...] The next major country house commission was the restoration of Hoghton Tower (1876–78) for SirHenry deHoghton. [...] Other work on country houses included building Sedgwick House (1868–69), adding an extension to Leighton Hall (1870), making extensions to Walton Hall (1870), Underley Hall (1872), Capernwray Hall (1875–76), and Whittington Hall (1887). [...] New houses included Oak Lea for Henry Schneider (1874, since demolished), Witherslack Hall (1874), and Hampsfield House (1880–82). [...] Their last major work on a country house was the remodelling of Thurland Castle (1879–85) following severe damage by fire.

It was so pitilessly manifest she was resolved to idealise the situation whatever I might say. I began {{walking up and down}} the room between those cyclamens and the cabinet. There were little gold fishermen on the cabinet fishing from little islands that each had a pagoda and a tree, and there were also men in boats or something, I couldn't determine what, and some obscure <b>sub-office</b> in my mind concerned itself with that quite intently. Yet I seem to have been striving with all my being to get words for the truth of things. [...] "You see," [...] I emerged, [...] "you make everything possible to me. You can give me help and sympathy, support, understanding. You know my political ambitions. You know all that I might do in the world. I do so intensely want to do constructive things, big things perhaps, in this wild jumble.... Only you don't know a bit what I am. I want to tell you what I am. I'm complex.... I'm streaked." ...|$|E
6000|$|He had {{finished}} that spring, not without credit, {{the last section}} of the great Mosuhl Canal, and - much against his will, for he hated office-work - had been sent in to serve during the hot weather on the accounts and supply side of the Department, with sole charge of the sweltering <b>sub-office</b> at {{the capital of the}} Province.

60|$|Scott moved leisurely to his room, {{and changed}} into the evening-dress {{of the season}} and the country: spotless white linen from head to foot, with a broad silk cummerbund. Dinner at the Martyns' was a decided {{improvement}} on the goat-mutton, twiney-tough fowl, and tinned entrees of the Club. But it was a great pity Martyn could not afford to send his sister to the Hills for the hot weather. As an Acting District Superintendent of Police, Martyn drew the magnificent pay of six hundred depreciated silver rupees a month, and his little four-roomed bungalow said just as much. There were the usual blue-and-white striped jail-made rugs on the uneven floor; the usual glass studded Amritsar phulkaris draped to nails driven into the flaking whitewash of the walls; the usual half-dozen chairs that did not match, picked up at sales of dead men's effects; and the usual streaks of black grease where the leather punka-thong ran through the wall. It was as though everything had been unpacked the night before to be repacked next morning. Not a door in the house was true on its hinges. The little windows, fifteen feet up, were darkened with wasp-nests, and lizards hunted flies between the beams of the wood-ceiled roof. But all this was part of Scott's life. Thus did people live who had such an income; and in a land where each man's pay, age, and position are printed in a book, that all may read, it is hardly worth while to play at pretences in word or deed. Scott counted eight years' service in the Irrigation Department, and drew eight hundred rupees a month, on the understanding that if he served the State faithfully for another twenty-two years he could retire on a pension of some four hundred rupees a month. His working life, which had been spent chiefly under canvas or in temporary shelters where a man could sleep, eat, and write letters, was bound up with the opening and guarding of irrigation canals, the handling of two or three thousand workmen of all castes and creeds, and the payment of vast sums of coined silver. He had finished that spring, not without credit, the last section of the great Mosuhl Canal, and--much against his will, for he hated office work--had been sent in to serve during the hot weather on the accounts and supply side of the Department, with sole charge of the sweltering <b>sub-office</b> at the capital of the Province.
