40|$|Internet of Things {{has become}} one of the big buzzwords in the IT market in recent years, and it is {{predicted}} to continue its rapid growth in the coming years. In order to talk about the Internet of Things, this thesis presents an introduction to Internet of Things, what it is, how it surrounds us, and why it is so important to provide security to Internet of Things devices. A 4 -layered protocol stack is proposed to work towards a common development framework for Internet of Things. Due to the limitations in power, bandwidth and processing power of devices, many of the established technologies and solutions we have today is simply not compatible with the requirements brought along by the Internet of Things. Wearables, smart homes and the Industrial Internet of Things are just some examples of what Internet of Things is being used for, and together with the use of previous research findings, it is shown how the different use-case areas bring different security requirements to developers. Standards such as ZigBee, Thread, Z-Wave, Bluetooth Low Energy, and WirelessHART are some examples of established standards trying to win out in the marketplace. Often, these standards serve specific use-case areas, and thus, a new standard is proposed. IP-Smart is based on open and well-known protocols and is intended to cover <b>several</b> <b>use-case</b> areas. Comparison of the different standards shows that the application layer is sometimes left open for developers (Thread, BLE, IP-Smart) to carry out, how weaknesses is found in standards proposing their own cryptographic algorithms (ZigBee, Z-Wave, andWirelessHART), howThread, IP-Smart and (if properly configured) BLE fulfills security off wearables, how standards require proper implementations to fulfill smart home requirements, and WirelessHART being the only standard which fulfills the additional performance requirements found in the Industrial Internet of Things. While many of the standards offer satisfactory security properties, the actual implementation is sometimes left to the developers to ensure secure products. An investigation into the two application layer protocols MQTT and CoAP indicates how CoAP with its use of DTLS provides a reasonable option to MQTT if extra reliability in lossy networks is of importance for the developers...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in Web 2. 0, SOA, crowd-sourcing, social and collaboration technologies, {{as well as}} cloud-computing, have truly transformed the Internet into a global development and deployment platform. As a result, developers have been presented with ubiquitous access to countless Web-services, resources and tools. However, while enabling tremendous automation and reuse opportunities, new productivity challenges have also emerged: The exploitation of services and resources nonetheless requires skilled programmers and a development-centric approach; it is thus inevitably susceptible to the same repetitive, error-prone and time consuming integration work each time a developer integrates a new API. Business Process Management {{on the other hand}} were proposed to support service-based integration. It provided the benefit of automation and modelling, which appealed to non-technical domain-experts. The problem however: it proves too rigid for unstructured processes. Thus, without this level of support, building new application either requires extensive manual programming or resorting to homebrew solutions. Alternatively, with the proliferation of SaaS, various such tools could be used for independent portions of the overall process - although this either presupposes conforming to the in-built process, or results in "shadow processes" via use of e-mail or the like, in order to exchange information and share decisions. There has therefore been an inevitable gap in technological support between structured and unstructured processes. To address these challenges, this thesis deals with transitioning process-support from structured to unstructured. We have been motivated to harness the foundational capabilities of BPM for its application to unstructured processes. We propose to achieve this by: First, addressing the productivity challenges of Web-services integration - simplifying this process - whilst encouraging an incremental curation and collective reuse approach. We then extend this to propose an innovative Hybrid-Process Management Platform that holistically combines structured, semi-structured and unstructured activities, based on a unified task-model that encapsulates a spectrum of process specificity. We have thus aimed to bridge the current lacking technology gap. The approach presented has been exposed as service-based libraries and tools. Whereby, we have devised <b>several</b> <b>use-case</b> scenarios and conducted user-studies in order to evaluate the overall effectiveness of our proposed work...|$|R

In this respect, Hadoop has gained much popularity since it scales to thousand of nodes and terabytes of data. However, Hadoop suffers from poor performance, especially in I/O performance.

However, tampering with a user’s data is not the only goal a Byzantine server might have.
