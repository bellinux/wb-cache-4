Archaeological surveys of Bryce Canyon National Park and the Paunsaugunt Plateau <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{have been in the}} area for at least 10,000years. Basketmaker Anasazi artifacts several thousand years old have been found south of the park. Other artifacts from the Pueblo-period Anasazi and the Fremont culture (up to the mid-12th century) have also been found.|$|E

25|$|Studies <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who forgive are {{happier and}} {{healthier}} {{than those who}} hold resentments. The first study {{to look at how}} forgiveness improves physical health discovered that when people think about forgiving an offender it leads to improved functioning in their cardiovascular and nervous systems. Another study at the University of Wisconsin found the more forgiving people were, the less they suffered {{from a wide range of}} illnesses. The less forgiving people reported a greater number of health problems.|$|E
25|$|A {{basic income}} (or {{negative}} income tax) {{is a system}} of social security that periodically provides each citizen with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on frugally. It is argued that recipients of the basic income would have considerably more bargaining power when negotiating a wage with an employer as {{there would be no}} risk of destitution for not taking the employment. As a result, the jobseeker could spend more time looking for a more appropriate or satisfying job, or they could wait until a higher-paying job appeared. Alternatively, they could spend more time increasing their skills in university, which would make them more suitable for higher-paying jobs, as well as provide numerous other benefits. Experiments on Basic Income and NIT in Canada and the USA <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> spent more time studying while the program was running.|$|E

25|$|Wegner {{has applied}} this {{principle}} to the inferences people make {{about their own}} conscious will. People typically experience a thought {{that is consistent with}} a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference. Through such work, Wegner has been able to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused – and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, priming subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause. The implication for such work is that the perception of conscious will (which he says might be more accurately labelled as 'the emotion of authorship') is not tethered to the execution of actual behaviors, but is inferred from various cues through an intricate mental process, authorship processing. Although many interpret this work as a blow against the argument for free will, both psychologists and philosophers have criticized Wegner's theories.|$|E
500|$|Citron's {{relationship}} with his wife was debated because historians doubt that she betrayed him, since {{she gave birth to}} their child shortly after his death. Madsen was sure the betrayal happened, but he took the liberty of affirming the couple did not get back together. Madsen declared, [...] "I do not think it is morally tarnished to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> have affairs with people they are not married to.

500|$|The new {{creative}} team, {{while avoiding}} references aimed specifically at adults, {{was determined not}} to adapt the humour to children or otherwise patronise their audience. Instead, they sought to make the best use possible of the material. Norris said that her goal was [...] "to make a <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> would say was too good for children... we started out with really high ambitions." [...] To that end, adult historical satires such as Blackadder and the Monty Python films were shown at the first writers' meeting to demonstrate the proposed tone, and these influences would be visible throughout the show's run.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{scheduled}} debut {{air date}} for Gone Too Far had been October 5, 2009. After Goldstein's death, DiSanto acknowledged {{the possibility that}} placing Goldstein near other addicts helped contribute to his relapse. After debating whether to air the show {{in the wake of}} his death, MTV decided to debut it on October 12. His family stated: [...] "It is our hope through airing this <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> will get to see the side of Adam that we knew and loved. The decision to air the show has been difficult, but we do this with the profound belief that it will inspire others to seek help". Favreau also consulted people close to Goldstein about whether the footage of him in Iron Man 2 should still be used; they agreed unanimously it should remain. Favreau said that following his death, [...] "there was never any doubt" [...] the film would be dedicated to him.|$|E
500|$|... "Tea Leaves" [...] {{was written}} by Matthew Weiner and Erin Levy and {{directed}} by series star Jon Hamm. This is the first episode of the series that Jon Hamm had directed, with Hamm saying that he owes thanks to John Slattery for paving the way. As preparation for directing the Rolling Stones concert, Hamm looked over archival photographs of the original concert. [...] "They were kids. The Rolling Stones. It was them and The Beatles. These huge pop explosions. People were really excited about {{it and it was}} a really big deal. And, in a larger sense, gave us a sense of where advertising is going." [...] Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that [...] "My job was not {{to go in there and}} muck it up and say, [...] "I'm gonna put my stamp on this." [...] My job was to go in there and keep the train on the tracks, basically. We have a very firmly established tone and look to our <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> respond to, and that I love." [...] Although the third episode of the season, it was actually the first episode produced for season, prior to the two-part season premiere, [...] "A Little Kiss".|$|E
