25|$|On October 4, 2007, Staal {{made his}} National Hockey League debut for the New York Rangers, {{as well as}} for Head Coach Tom Renney, who would use him in that first season {{primarily}} in a defensive role. Staal would record his first NHL point against the Washington Capitals on November 1, 2007, when Chris Drury deflected his shot in for a goal, earning Staal an assist. Staal scored his first NHL goal on November 14, 2007, against the New Jersey Devils at the Prudential Center. His wrist shot from the left faceoff circle sailed over the outstretched glove of goaltender Martin Brodeur and deflected in off the crossbar. Assisting on his first goal in the NHL were teammates Scott Gomez and Brendan Shanahan. During 2007–08, Staal was one of 16 rookies selected to participate in the YoungStars competition at the 2008 NHL All-Star Game in Atlanta, where he scored a goal and added an assist. Staal finished his rookie season with ten points on the strength of two goals and eight assists; he also established himself as a reliable defender, posting a positive plus/minus rating at +2, as the Rangers qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs. He saved his best for the playoffs, with his first NHL playoff goal and two assists to help the Rangers defeat the Devils in five games during the Eastern Conference Quarter-finals. The goal was important — in the pivotal Game 4, Staal's <b>slapper</b> broke a 3–3 deadlock late in the third period and stood to be the game-winning goal in a 5–3 victory that gave the Rangers a 3–1 lead in the series. Like his first regular season goal, it also came against Martin Brodeur. However, despite their win over the Devils in the Conference Quarter-finals, the Rangers would fall to the eventual Stanley Cup runner-up Pittsburgh Penguins in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008–09, Chára {{was named}} to his fourth All-Star Game. As {{back-to-back}} champion of the hardest shot competition, Chára initiated a charity drive among the participants ($1,000 per player) {{to go to the}} charity of choice of the competition's winner. The 2009 installation of the event featured additional intrigue, as three players widely considered to possess the hardest shots in the NHL (Chára, Sheldon Souray and Shea Weber) had all been chosen as All-Stars, and therefore would participate in the event. Having raised $24,000 from the six competitors and their respective teams, the NHL and the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA), Chára set a new Skills Competition record with a 105.4mph (169.7km/h) slapshot. He donated the winnings to Right to Play, and due to Chára's leading role in fundraising for charity, the hardest shot competition that year was punningly dubbed a [...] "Chara"ty event. The shot passed Al Iafrate's previous record 105.2mph (169.3km/h) <b>slapper</b> from the 1993 competition. During the season, Chára posted a career best 19 goals, and eclipsed his career best points total, reaching the 50-point plateau for the second consecutive year with a goal and an assist in his final game of the season. For his efforts, he won his first Norris Trophy as the NHL's best defenseman, beating out Mike Green of the Washington Capitals and Nicklas Lidström of the Detroit Red Wings. Chára would post another standout season in 2009–10, scoring 44 points. His goal total fell to seven from the year before, but his play was as strong as ever, leading the Bruins to lock him up long-term with a contract extension; on 9 October 2010, he re-signed with the Bruins on a seven-year deal.|$|E

50|$|Both {{metal and}} wood slappers {{are used for}} metalworking. Generally wood slappers are covered with a leather-face. Slappers {{can be used to}} shrink, contour, and planish (smooth) the panel without leaving rough marks to clean up. The <b>slapper</b> {{controls}} more surface with each blow than a hammer can and is very easy to use because it has the same angle of attack as a body hammer. This means the user does not need to change their arm and hand position when moving from hammer to <b>slapper.</b> The <b>slapper</b> can be far more effective than the hammer for shrinking because its leverage gives greater mechanical advantage over the rough spots. The <b>slapper</b> is great for working metal over a T-stake or for gouging and planishing. A good <b>slapper</b> can make radius bends and crowns quite well. A <b>slapper</b> works well with forming stakes and post dollies for lightly planishing and pulling cold shrinks.|$|E

A worker, using repeated, relatively soft glancing blows, smooths the metal toward the curvature of the stake. If the metal begins to look dimpled, the worker is using too much force in individual hammer blows.|$|R
