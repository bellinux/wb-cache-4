25|$|Porsche AG, 2000, patent # 6029987, Front Axle for a Motor Vehicle. Describes a <b>strut</b> <b>suspension</b> system {{supported}} by a transverse leaf-spring system largely {{the same as that}} used by the Corvette. The Porsche patent mentions the beneficial stabilizing effects of this arrangement.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} uses oleo <b>strut</b> <b>suspension</b> for its 24 wheels. The suspension {{has been}} calibrated to allow landing on rough terrain {{and is able}} to kneel to allow easier front loading. The plane has an onboard overhead crane capable of lifting up to 30 tonnes of cargo, and items up to 120 tonnes can be winched on board.|$|E
2500|$|The second generation, {{introduced}} in Japan in September 1988, followed by their European debut at the Brussels Auto Salon in October. Some {{say it was}} designed at GM's Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, USA, and GM did designate it the GM M platform. (Personal interviews with GM Proving Grounds [...] Technicians indicate that the car was never seen at the Proving Grounds during the development period, thus casting doubt on a Warren design.) The chassis, engines, and drivetrains were developed by Suzuki, The second generation offered new styling and four wheel independent <b>strut</b> <b>suspension.</b> A turbocharged version remained fairly popular in Canada, which was the only export market for the version.|$|E
50|$|The F10/F11/F07 is {{the sixth}} {{generation}} 5 Series, produced from 2010-2016. The platform {{is based on}} the F01 7 Series; improvements include a front dual ball joint short-long arm suspension (replacing the MacPherson <b>strut</b> <b>suspensions</b> BMW previously used), and a rear multilink suspension.|$|R
50|$|ZAZ-1102 Tavria, a 3-door {{hatchback}} {{released in}} 1987, {{was the first}} model of the range. It features independent MacPherson <b>struts</b> <b>suspension</b> at the front and a twist-beam rear suspension. The water-cooled MeMZ-245 I4 engine was a major shift forward from the air-cooled V4 used in former models.|$|R
50|$|A strut bar is {{designed}} to reduce this strut tower flex by tying the two strut towers together. This transmits the load off each strut tower during cornering which ties the two towers together and reduces chassis flex. To accomplish this effectively (especially on MacPherson <b>strut</b> <b>suspensions),</b> the bar must be rigid throughout its length.|$|R
2500|$|The Bluebird 910, the of {{the last}} rear-wheel drive Bluebird, {{featured}} simple clean-cut lines, unlike the [...] "Coke Bottle" [...] styling of its predecessor. It did however retain the same engine range, the same MacPherson <b>strut</b> <b>suspension</b> and the same [...] wheelbase as the 810. Starting with this generation, in Japan the Bluebird returned to offering only four-cylinder vehicles, and the six-cylinder Bluebird {{was replaced by the}} Nissan Skyline based Nissan Leopard at Nissan Bluebird Store Japanese dealerships. Bluebirds of this generation were renowned for reliability but rusted away in salted areas long before the engine gave trouble. Nissan realigned with the Japanese Stanza/Auster/Violet sedans which were assigned to individual Japanese Nissan dealerships.|$|E
2500|$|The first Skyline GT-R, {{known by}} the {{internal}} Nissan designation PGC10, was released on 4 February 1969, and was exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealership network called Nissan Prince Store when the Prince company was integrated into Nissan operations in 1966. It was available originally as a four-door sedan after a public debut at the October 1968 Tokyo Motor Show. It was advertised alongside the Nissan R380 racecar to showcase the Skyline's racing heraldry. It was equipped with the 2.0L DOHC S20 I6 producing [...] at 7000 rpm and [...] of torque at 5600 rpm. Power was delivered to the rear wheels by a 5-speed manual transmission. The first Skyline GT-R rode on a semi-trailing arm <b>strut</b> <b>suspension.</b> It was available as a coupe in March 1971 with the chassis code KPGC10.|$|E
2500|$|With the 1988 {{model year}} came a {{completely}} new front and rear suspension with vented disc brakes at all four corners- what Pontiac's engineers had planned for the car to have from the beginning. The front suspension geometry was changed to decrease the scrub radius thus decreasing steering effort without adding a bulky power steering system. The camber curve was also much improved, the dampers are moved inside the coil springs, and new sealed bearing/hub units were used in 1988. The rear suspension featured multi-link (two lateral links and one trailing arm) Chapman <b>strut</b> <b>suspension,</b> and the tie-rod related bump steer experienced with the earlier suspension design was fixed. The brakes were also upgraded to [...] vented rotors {{on the front and}} rear with an improved slide caliper design having larger diameter slides. The Fiero Formula (new for 1988) and Fiero GT models also received a rear anti-sway bar to compliment non-progressive rate springs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{configuration of}} the Arena consists {{of a combination of}} independent MacPherson <b>strut</b> <b>suspensions</b> from a saloon car at the front, and torsion beam, leaf sprung suspensions at the rear. Other modifications include the use of a rigid rear axle, an uprated front stabiliser bar, and 14" [...] front ventilated discs and 9" [...] rear drum brakes with load sensing proportioning valves (LSPV), optimised weight distribution and the use of reinforced high profile tyres. Lotus Engineering provided additional ride and handling enhancements.|$|R
50|$|In Singapore, Thailand and New Zealand, the R11 Presea came {{predominantly}} {{with the}} ancient 1.6L GA16DE. With essentially every curve and panel being unchanged, {{and only a}} fresher looking headlights and rear lamp cluster the car still had the same old MacPherson <b>struts</b> <b>suspension</b> up front and rear multi link geometry. Market demand for such a car fell rapidly, as the economic recession in Japan began to take full effect, known in Japan as the Lost Decade and the Presea was also cancelled after review under Nissan Revival Plan.|$|R
50|$|TRD offers bolt-on headers, sport mufflers, and cat-back {{exhausts}} {{that are}} 50 state emission legal. Cold air intakes are also sold {{but not always}} emission legal. Suspension equipment includes coilovers, springs, dampers and <b>struts,</b> <b>suspension</b> tower braces, sway bars, and wheel upgrades as well. Braking hardware includes full brake kits including calipers, rotors and stainless steel braided brake lines. Separate performance brake pads are also sold. Oil and air filters are offered. Engine head gaskets and camshafts are sold as well. A number of cosmetic modifications are available among other performance equipment.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} is a MacPherson <b>strut</b> <b>suspension</b> and {{the rear}} is multilink one.|$|E
50|$|The coilover {{style of}} spring {{placement}} is {{a component of}} the MacPherson <b>strut</b> <b>suspension</b> system, which uses a design of anti-roll bar as a longitudinal constraint.|$|E
50|$|The MacPherson strut is {{a common}} form of <b>strut</b> <b>suspension.</b> This {{was not the first}} attempt at <b>strut</b> <b>suspension,</b> but in MacPherson's {{original}} patent, the anti-roll bar forms an integral and essential part of the suspension, in addition to its usual function in controlling body roll. A <b>strut</b> <b>suspension</b> like MacPherson's requires a hinged lower member between the chassis and wheel hub to control the wheel position both inwards and outwards (controlling the track), and also forwards and backwards. This may be provided by a wishbone with a number of joints, or by using an additional radius rod. MacPherson's design replaced the wishbone with a simpler and cheaper track control arm, with a single inboard joint, to control the track. Forward and backward position was controlled through the anti-roll bar. Overall this required a simpler and cheaper set of suspension members than with wishbones, also allowing a reduction in unsprung weight.|$|E
50|$|The Audi 80 had a MacPherson <b>strut</b> front <b>suspension,</b> and a C-section beam {{rear axle}} located by {{trailing}} arms and a Panhard rod, and using coil springs and telescopic dampers.|$|R
50|$|The Mk II's MacPherson <b>strut</b> front <b>suspension</b> was {{replaced}} with more conventional double A-arm suspension to give the car a soft 'freeway' ride, which gave the larger engines distinct understeer.|$|R
5000|$|The Rover SD1 (released in 1976) shared several {{engineering}} features {{with the}} P76 [...] - [...] including MacPherson <b>strut</b> front <b>suspension,</b> the aluminium V8 engine and a live rear axle.|$|R
5000|$|All {{versions}} {{came with}} a five speed gearbox, front-wheel drive, a front transverse engine, a MacPherson <b>strut</b> <b>suspension</b> and a front and rear rigid [...] "omega" [...] axle.|$|E
5000|$|After the Cadet was {{canceled}} in May 1947, MacPherson left GM, joining the Ford Motor Company later that year. One {{of his first}} projects was to adapt his <b>strut</b> <b>suspension</b> design for the 1949 Ford Vedette, for Ford's French subsidiary. This became the first car to use the true MacPherson <b>strut</b> <b>suspension.</b> Ford's Poissy plant {{got off to a}} slow start with the Vedette, however, and the Fords Zephyr and Consul which captured the headlines at the 1950 London Motor Show have also been claimed as the first cars to appear [...] "in mass production" [...] with MacPherson struts.|$|E
50|$|Official WRC {{models in}} the initial 2500 were only {{produced}} in 1994 {{as required by the}} WRC homologation rules. All ST205 sold in Australia were WRC models and called the GT-Four Group A Rallye. All the Australian-spec ST205 came with leather interior, and the only options were air conditioner and glass sunroof. Each of 77 cars also came with limited edition numbered plaque mounted ahead of the gear shift. Instead of using the Super <b>Strut</b> <b>Suspension</b> as found in the production cars, the actual ST205 rally cars for WRC came with standard <b>strut</b> <b>suspension</b> as they found the wear rates too high from the rigors of rallying.|$|E

50|$|The {{platform}} basics are a MacPherson <b>strut</b> <b>suspension</b> {{in front}} and 3-link solid axle in the rear with a Panhard rod. Unlike previous Special Vehicle Team (SVT) Mustang variations, the Shelby GT500 does not include independent rear suspension, but instead has a solid rear axle.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Toyota Caldina was the 5-door wagon {{or commercial}} van version (1992-2002) of the four-door sedan Toyota Corona and Toyota Carina in Japan. The wagon has independent <b>strut</b> rear <b>suspension</b> while the commercial wagon has semi-independent leaf springs.|$|R
50|$|In {{cars with}} double {{wishbone}} suspensions, camber angle may be fixed or adjustable, but in MacPherson <b>strut</b> <b>suspensions,</b> it is normally fixed. The elimination of an available camber adjustment may reduce maintenance requirements, {{but if the}} car is lowered by use of shortened springs, the camber angle will change. Excessive camber angle can lead to increased tire wear and impaired handling. Significant suspension modifications may correspondingly require that the upper control arm or strut mounting points be altered to allow for some inward or outward movement, relative to longitudinal centerline of the vehicle, for camber adjustment. Aftermarket plates with slots for strut mounts instead of just holes are available {{for most of the}} commonly modified models of cars.|$|R
5000|$|As Volkswagen's first 4-door saloon, the Type 4 also {{introduced}} unibody construction, coil springs, trailing wishbone rear suspension, hydraulic clutch manual transmission [...] - [...] {{as well as}} MacPherson <b>strut</b> front <b>suspension,</b> subsequently adapted to the VW Type 1 1302/1303 ("Super Beetle").|$|R
