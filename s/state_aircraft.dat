In 2009, Governor Ted Strickland designated Dayton as Ohio's aerospace innovation hub, the first such technology hub in the <b>state.</b> <b>Aircraft</b> engine manufacturing accounts for nearly 75% of Ohio's aerospace and defense industry workforce.|$|E
5|$|The Asia Minor Campaign was {{followed}} by a long period of peace during which both the Hellenic Army and Naval Aviation Services were reorganized and upgraded. From 1925 new types of aircraft of British and, mainly, French manufacture were delivered. At 1925, in co-operation with the British Company Blackburn Aircraft, the <b>State</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Factory (KEA) was set up in Phaleron, near Athens. The factory developed a number of aircraft that were designed by Blackburn Aircraft and built under license, like the two-seat torpedo carrier, T3A Velos and the KEA Chelidon, as well as the Armstrong Whitworth Atlas and the Avro 504. On the other hand, a new Naval Aviation school was established at Tatoi, Attica, in 1926.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aviation}} {{units in}} the Greek Armed Forces were formed in June 1912. In the following Balkan Wars, the Hellenic Navy {{was the first in}} military history to use aircraft to track down and bomb the enemy fleet (1913). The Naval Air Service was officially established during the First World War and participated with the Allies in several missions over the Aegean. After participation in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) a long period of peace followed during which the Naval Air Service was reorganized and upgraded, especially with the establishment of the <b>State</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Factory, which manufactured various types of aircraft. In 1930 the Naval Air Service was merged with the Hellenic Army Aviation and formed the third branch in the Greek Armed Forces, the Hellenic Air Force.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day, January 29, {{the prosecution}} delivered a 40-minute closing argument. Blagojevich then delivered his 47-minute closing arguments in defense. Among Blagojevich's statement were continuing reminders {{that he believed}} the process to be tainted {{because it did not}} allow him to call witnesses or challenge the evidence (although, as the Chicago Tribune reported two days earlier, the process did in fact allow the governor to call witnesses and challenge the evidence, but Blagojevich had done neither by the deadline). The prosecution then made a 12-minute rebuttal. Blagojevich did not remain in the Statehouse for the prosecution's rebuttal speech or the vote on his impeachment. After giving his closing statement, Blagojevich immediately left Springfield to return to his Chicago home aboard an official <b>state</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Had Blagojevich remained in Springfield for his impeachment, he would have been immediately ineligible to be transported on <b>state</b> <b>aircraft</b> as he would no longer be Governor—he would have been stranded in Springfield, responsible for his own transportation home.|$|E

The project was promoted by engineer Ricardo Olmedo and became {{under the guidance of}} engineer Aníbal Dreidemie, who also designed the IA-52 Guaraní II and the IA-63 Pampa.

25|$|The German {{invasion}} of Poland {{at the start}} of the Second World War resulted in the destruction of Poland's aviation industry, and following the end of the war the Polish government decided to re-establish a national aviation industry. Two design bureaus were set up to design and develop prototypes, Lotnicze Warsztaty Doświadczalne (LWD) (Aircraft Experimental Workshops) at Łódź and the Centralné Studium Samolotów (C.S.S.) (Central Aircraft Office) based at Warsaw, with production to be carried out at a series of <b>State</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Factories. The C.S.S., led by Franciszek Misztal, who worked as a designer in the pre-war PZL, was tasked with the design of three types, the CSS-10, a single-engined primary trainer, an aerobatic trainer, the CSS-11 and a twin-engined feederliner, which was designated CSS-12.|$|E
25|$|In late January 2010, Indonesian Air Force {{commander}} Air Marshal Imam Sufaat made {{it clear}} that Indonesia had split the competition, designating the Embraer EMB-314 Super Tucano turboprop from Brazil as the preferred replacement for their OV-10s. Indonesia signed a memorandum of understanding with Embraer at the Indo Defense 2010 exhibition in Jakarta. Indonesia ordered eight EMB-314 Super Tucanos at first, with an option for another eight on the same terms. The first Super Tucanos were scheduled to arrive in 2012, and the order also included ground-support stations and a logistics package. Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro added that <b>state</b> <b>aircraft</b> maker PT Dirgantara Indonesia would be used for maintenance work, and they also hoped Dirgantara would wind up manufacturing some parts and components. Subsequent contracts have ordered a total of 16 of these Super Tucano planes for the Tentara Nasional Indonesia – Angkatan Udara (TNI-AU), Indonesian Air Force.|$|E

There were few developments of note during the year, with the obsolete fleet continuing to decline, and even the <b>state</b> <b>aircraft</b> factory at Kraljevo was largely idle except {{for the production of}} spare parts for the large number of Breguet 19 aircraft still in service. The Ikarus and Zmaj factories at Zemun installed plant and equipment for the production of the Hawker Fury under licence, but the delivery of the ten purchased aircraft was not expected until March 1937, and it was not expected that any of the locally made aircraft would be delivered until May of that year. Ikarus also produced several Avia BH-33E fighters, and overhauled a large number of Potez 25 aircraft during the year. A prototype Dornier Do 17 light bomber with Gnome-Rhône engines was ordered, with a further order for nineteen more aircraft pending a successful trial.|$|E

500|$|The new {{streamlined}} low-wing monoplane {{design was}} to have a retractable undercarriage. Like the IK-2 it was initially developed privately by Ilić and Sivčev. A scale model was tested in the Eiffel-built wind tunnel in Paris, but the pair soon realised that they needed a third engineer to help with evaluating the design and determining the structural details. Slobodan Zrnić, the head of construction at the Yugoslav <b>State</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Factory in Kraljevo, was recruited, as he had worked as a specialist aircraft engineer in France. The project name for the IK-2 was changed from IK, standing for (Ljubomir) Ilić and Kosta (Sivčev), to IKZ, to include Zrnić. This name was changed, possibly due to the similarities between the Cyrillic [...] "З" [...] (Z) and the Arabic numeral [...] "3", and the aircraft became known as the IK-3. The aircraft was to be powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Y29 engine, generating [...] at [...] The designers chose to favour manoeuvrability over speed, trying to find a compromise between the German and British concepts of a modern monoplane fighter. The design had a smaller wing area than the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire, to achieve a relatively higher speed for the engine power. In comparison to the Messerschmitt Bf109, the Yugoslav design had a shorter fuselage and smaller turning radius. It differed from British and German design concepts in that its proposed armament was concentrated in the fuselage.|$|E
