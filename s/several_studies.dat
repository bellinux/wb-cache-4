5|$|<b>Several</b> <b>studies</b> {{have also}} implicated {{warfarin}} use in valvular and vascular calcification. No specific treatment is available, but some modalities are under investigation.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} rapid growth rate, short life span, and {{tolerance}} to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids {{are regarded as}} one of the most promising species for mariculture. Although there have been <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> about this, there have been no reported commercial-scale cultures, as of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Route 17 {{has been}} the object of <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> {{exploring}} a Bergen BRT, a bus rapid transit system that would potentially alleviate some traffic congestion and decrease automobile dependency. While funding has not been identified, the potential routes of the system have centered around the vicinity radiating from the malls of Paramus.|$|E

5000|$|The Institute was {{composed}} of <b>several</b> <b>study</b> groups doing research on the following topics: ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Several</b> <b>studies</b> have {{investigated}} the proteome of E. coli. By 2006, 1,627 (38%) of the 4,237 open reading frames (ORFs) had been identified experimentally.|$|E
5|$|<b>Several</b> <b>studies</b> have {{suggested}} that DST increases motor fuel consumption. The 2008 DOE report found no significant increase in motor gasoline consumption due to the 2007 United States extension of DST.|$|E
5|$|<b>Several</b> <b>studies</b> of diets {{supplemented}} with MFGM and its components, including gangliosides and sphingomyelin, {{have aimed to}} address measures of cognitive development in pediatric populations. In some of the studies, MFGM supplementation to infant formula was shown to narrow the gap in cognitive development between breastfed and formula-fed infants.|$|E
50|$|In {{the period}} between 1950 and 1972 Remo Rossi {{accomplished}} <b>several</b> <b>study</b> travels in Spain, Greece, Belgium, England, Turkey, France, Austria, Hungary and Russia.|$|R
50|$|During {{his student}} years, Elron made <b>several</b> <b>study</b> trips to Moscow, Prague and Budapest {{where he spent}} {{his time in the}} museums, {{studying}} the great masters.|$|R
50|$|PEU {{also offers}} {{interdisciplinary}} education - {{a possibility of}} simultaneous study at some faculties in <b>several</b> <b>study</b> programmes in a foreign language, bilingual and multilingual lectures.|$|R
5|$|The {{department}} of entomology has done <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> in apiculture, chemical ecology, horticultural pollination, and the behavior of honeybee and bumblebee colonies. Although some research {{was done in the}} apiary yards, the majority of data had to be collected with higher numbers of colonies at different experimental stations.|$|E
5|$|After initial {{reports that}} {{warfarin}} could reduce bone mineral density, <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> have demonstrated {{a link between}} warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1980s, <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> {{suggested}} a link between children's consumption of aspirin and Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal disease. By 1986, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required warning labels on all aspirin, further suppressing sales. The makers of Tylenol also {{filed a lawsuit against}} Anacin aspirin maker American Home Products, claiming that the failure to add warning labels before 1986 had unfairly held back Tylenol sales, though this suit was eventually dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Although the convulsions {{caused by}} {{central nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} may lead to incidental injury to the victim, it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to the nervous system following the seizure could occur and <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> searched for evidence of such damage. An overview of these studies by Bitterman in 2004 concluded that following removal of breathing gas containing high fractions of oxygen, no long-term neurological damage from the seizure remains.|$|E
5|$|Americium is an {{artificial}} element of recent origin, and thus {{does not have}} a biological requirement. It is harmful to life. It has been proposed to use bacteria for removal of americium and other heavy metals from rivers and streams. Thus, Enterobacteriaceae of the genus Citrobacter precipitate americium ions from aqueous solutions, binding them into a metal-phosphate complex at their cell walls. <b>Several</b> <b>studies</b> have been reported on the biosorption and bioaccumulation of americium by bacteria and fungi.|$|E
5|$|Bolzano and Willi were great-great grandsons of Folie, {{while the}} rest were great-great-great grandsons. Especially {{in the early years}} of the breed's history, some {{inbreeding}} occurred, both by accident and design, which served to reinforce the breed's dominant characteristics. During the 1980s and 1990s, <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> were conducted to examine morphological differences among the breed lines. Significant differences were found in some characteristics, including height and proportions; these have been used to help achieve breeding objectives, especially in Italy during the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|In 1987 Najem Wali went to Madrid {{to study}} Spanish literature. In 1990 he {{returned}} to Hamburg. <b>Several</b> <b>study</b> visits followed, for example to Oxford in 1993 and to Florence in 1995.|$|R
50|$|Cappelen went on <b>several</b> <b>study</b> {{tours in}} Norway: the Gudbrandsdalen and Lom (along with Gude and Johan Fredrik Eckersberg, 1846), Sogn and Hardanger (1847), {{as well as}} several summer {{residence}} in the countryside around Holden.|$|R
50|$|Samastipur {{has several}} schools and colleges. Most {{of the colleges}} are {{affiliated}} to the Lalit Narayan Mithila University, Darbhanga. IGNOU has <b>several</b> <b>study</b> centres in Samastipur. The Rajendra Agricultural University is located near the town, in Pusa.|$|R
5|$|Fraudulent {{accounting}} {{can arise}} {{from a variety}} of issues. These problems usually come to light eventually and could ruin not only the company but also the auditors for not discovering or revealing the misstatements. <b>Several</b> <b>studies</b> have proposed that a firm's corporate culture as well as the values it stresses may negatively alter an accountant's behavior. This environment could contribute to the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities.|$|E
5|$|Ibicella lutea {{is another}} flypaper protocarnivore {{that has been}} the subject of <b>several</b> <b>studies.</b> Early studies {{concluded}} that the plant digested proteinaceous offerings, though the methods were crude. Subsequent studies done more carefully tested for the presence of protease activity and found none, though it was noted that the plant has a great capacity for capturing and killing prey.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> {{were devoted}} to Normanisation in 12th century Scotland, {{focusing}} upon and hence emphasising the changes {{brought about by the}} reign of David I. Græme Ritchie's The Normans in Scotland (1954), Archie Duncan's Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom (1974) and the many articles of G. W. S. Barrow all formed part of this historiographical trend.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Campanian of North America, Daspletosaurus was a {{contemporary}} of the albertosaurine tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus. This {{is one of}} the few examples of two tyrannosaur genera coexisting. In modern predator guilds, similar-sized predators are separated into different ecological niches by anatomical, behavioral or geographical differences that limit competition. <b>Several</b> <b>studies</b> have attempted to explain niche differentiation in Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Np2O5 is black-brown {{in color}} and monoclinic with a lattice size of 418×658×409picometres. It is {{relatively}} unstable and decomposes to NpO2 and O2 at 420-695°C. Although Np2O5 was initially subject to <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> that claimed to produce it with mutually contradictory methods, it was eventually prepared successfully by heating neptunium peroxide to 300-350°C for 2–3 hours or by heating it under a layer of water in an ampoule at 180°C.|$|E
5|$|Several reviews {{have found}} that the use of AAC does not impede the {{development}} of speech in individuals with autism or developmental disabilities, and in fact, may result in modest gains being observed. A 2006 research review of 23 AAC intervention studies found gains in speech production in 89% of the cases studied, with the remainder showing no change. A descriptive review looking specifically at Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) intervention studies found that <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> reported an increase in speech, often during later phases, while one noted little or no effect.|$|E
