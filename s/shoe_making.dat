25|$|The Jews of Yemen had {{expertise}} {{in a wide}} range of trades normally avoided by Zaydi Muslims. Trades such as silver-smithing, blacksmiths, repairing weapons and tools, weaving, pottery, masonry, carpentry, <b>shoe</b> <b>making,</b> and tailoring were occupations that were exclusively taken by Jews. The division of labor created a sort of covenant, based on mutual economic and social dependency, between the Zaydi Muslim population and the Jews of Yemen. The Muslims produced and supplied food, and the Jews supplied all manufactured products and services that the Yemeni farmers needed.|$|E
25|$|New Hampshire {{experienced}} a significant shift in its economic base {{during the last}} century. Historically, the base was composed of the traditional New England manufactures of textiles, <b>shoe</b> <b>making,</b> and small machining shops drawing upon low-wage labor from nearby small farms and from parts of Quebec. Today, these sectors contribute only 2% for textiles, 2% for leather goods, and 9% for machining of the state's total manufacturing dollar value (Source: U.S. Economic Census for 1997, Manufacturing, New Hampshire). They {{experienced a}} sharp decline due to obsolete plants and the lure of cheaper wages in the South.|$|E
25|$|St. Louis {{industry}} in 1929 had diversified {{a great deal}} since the late 19th century; in order of significance, St. Louis {{industry in}}cluded food processing, chemical production, steelmaking, and clothing and <b>shoe</b> <b>making.</b> The industrial districts of St. Louis were readily identifiable due {{to the efforts of}} the Board of Health in the 1880s: the North Broadway area included lumber mills, Mallinckrodt Chemical, St. Louis Car Company, meatpacking houses, and railroad yards. South Broadway heavy industries included Anheuser-Busch, Monsanto, American Car and Foundry, and a railroad yard for the Iron Mountain Railroad. Extending west from downtown and south of Union Station were the yards for the Missouri Pacific and the Frisco, more meatpacking plants, and the Liggett and Myers tobacco factory. Downtown commerce and industries were mostly light manufacturing, major wholesalers and retailers, banks and insurance companies.|$|E

25|$|Horses were {{central to}} Cuman culture {{and way of}} life, and their main {{activity}} was animal husbandry. The knight, Robert de Clari, described the Cumans as nomadic warriors who raised horses, sheep, goats, camels, and cattle. They moved north with their herds in summer and returned south in winter. Some of the Cumans led a semi-settled life and took part in trading and farming, as well as blacksmithing, furriery, <b>shoe</b> <b>making,</b> saddle making, bow making, and clothes making. They mainly sold and exported animals, mostly horses, and animal products. They attached feeding sacks to the bridles of their horses, allowing them to cover great distances. They could go on campaign with little baggage and carry everything they needed. They wore sheepskin and were armed with composite bows and arrows. They prayed to the first animal they saw in the morning. Like the Bulgars, the Cumans were known to drink blood from their horse (they would cut a vein) when {{they ran out of}} water far from an available source. Their traditional diet consisted of soup with millet and meat and included beer, curdled mare's milk, kumis, and bread (though bread could be rare depending on location).|$|E
25|$|Three of {{the four}} Bs that have shaped Chesham's history relate to its industries. Brush making was {{introduced}} around 1829 {{to make use of}} the off-cuts from woodworking. Boot and <b>shoe</b> <b>making</b> which started as a cottage industry later expanding through small workshops thrived following the opening of tanneries around 1792 which also supplied leather for saddle making and glove. By the mid-19th century both brushmaking and footwear manufacture became major industries in the town with production concentrated in large factories. The industry declined in the early-20th century as the market for heavy boots declined. Beer brewing grew rapidly around the town centre in the 19th century again declining at the start of the 20th century. These traditional industries were succeeded by smaller but more commercial enterprises which took advantage of the available skilled labour. For example, in 1908 the Chiltern Toy Works was opened by Joseph Eisenmann on Bellingdon Road, later moving to the 'new' industrial estate in Waterside, making high quality teddy bears. The works finally closed in 1960. Post Second World War industry has ranged from the manufacture of glue (Industrial Adhesives) to aluminium-based packaging (Alcan), Aluminium Castings & Bronze Castings (Draycast Foundries Limited) and balloons (B-Loony).|$|E
500|$|After {{trying and}} failing to find work in New Hampshire, in 1833 Wilson walked {{more than one hundred}} miles to Natick, Massachusetts seeking {{employment}} or a trade. Having met William P. Legro, a shoemaker who was willing to train him, Wilson hired himself out for five months to learn to make leather shoes called brogans. [...] Wilson learned the trade in a few weeks, bought out his employment contract for $15, and opened his own shop, intending to save enough money to study law. Wilson had success as a shoemaker, and was able to save several hundred dollars in a relatively short time. [...] This success gave rise to legends about Wilson's skill; according to one story that grew with retelling, he once attempted to make one hundred pairs of shoes without sleeping, and fell asleep with the one hundredth pair in his hand. [...] Wilson's <b>shoe</b> <b>making</b> experience {{led to the creation of}} the political nicknames his supporters later used to highlight his working class roots—the [...] "Natick Cobbler" [...] and the [...] "Natick Shoemaker".|$|E
50|$|During {{this period}} {{significant}} industry came to Wollaston {{in the form}} of shoe- making and farming.

500|$|The Republican {{convention}} {{opened on}} June 5 in Philadelphia and the delegates {{were in an}} enthusiastic mood. For {{the first time in}} party convention history, telegraph operators communicated minute-by-minute proceedings to the nation. The Republican platform supported amnesty for former Confederates, low tariffs, civil service reform, Grant's Indian Peace policy, and civil rights for African Americans. Grant was unanimously renominated on the second day, to the loud cheers of the convention crowd. Wilson was popular among Republicans for the vice presidential nomination, with an appealing rags-to-riches story that included his rise from indentured servant to owner and operator of a successful <b>shoe</b> <b>making</b> business. On the first ballot, he defeated Colfax, who by then had become an active candidate by renouncing his 1870 pledge and informing his supporters that he would accept renomination if it was offered. The Republicans believed Wilson's nomination, as a politician of integrity coming from the anti-slavery movement, would outflank the anti-corruption argument of the Liberal Republicans, who counted Sumner among their members. Both Grant and his new running mate Wilson were idealized by Republican posters, which depicted Grant [...] "the Galena Tanner" [...] and Wilson [...] "the Natick Shoemaker" [...] carrying tools and wearing workmen's aprons. (Grant's father operated a tanning and leather goods manufacturing business, and before the Civil War Grant had clerked in his father's Galena, Illinois store.) In July, in an unprecedented political party fusion influenced by Schurz, the Democrats adopted the Liberal Republican platform and endorsed that party's candidates. Grant's personal popularity proved insurmountable in the general election, and Grant and Wilson went on to overwhelmingly defeat Greeley and Brown in both the popular and electoral college votes. Wilson's nomination for Vice President had been intended to strengthen the Republican ticket, and was seen as a success.|$|E
