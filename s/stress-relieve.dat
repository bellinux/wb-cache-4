5000|$|Any {{machining}} process on a barrel, whether it's boring, rifling, or turning the outside contour, will produce some {{stress in the}} steel of the barrel. This stress can cause the barrel to expand unevenly as it heats, causing shots to [...] "walk" [...] as the barrel heats and cools. To prevent this, careful post-machining heat treatment {{is often used to}} <b>stress-relieve</b> the barrels. The amount of good this does depends on the technique used to make the barrel. For example, the hammer forging method of manufacture leaves a significant amount of stress in the barrels, which could be addressed through stress-relieving heat treatment.|$|E
40|$|Nature uses a {{combination}} of dynamic hydrogen bonds and static covalent bonds in e. g. the muscle sarcomer to achieve toughness in otherwise elastic materials. The dynamic bonds can open when a force is applied, thereby providing a <b>stress-relieve</b> mechanism to prevent rupturing of the covalent links. Upon release of external force the hydrogen bond network can heal to restore the former properties. To mimic these astonishing effects we envisioned a similar combination in elastomeric compounds by creating a dual network of hydrogen bonded and covalently linked polyisoprene. We synthesized a number of dual networks by first modifying polyisoprene with hydrogen bond forming urazole groups to form supramolecular networks with a cross-linking density between 0 and 15 mol%. In a second step covalent crosslinks were added by hydrosilylation with a bissilane linker. Linear rheological analysis of the transient network showed a dissipation mechanism extrapolated {{to be on the}} order of 0. 01 - 0. 10 s at ambient temperature. In combination with neutron scattering, which provides unrivalled and first insights on the chain level, the self-healing properties of these novel semi-transient networks are studied on the molecular level in static and dynamic deformation through a selective labelling of chains. Understanding of the self-healing mechanism in these mixed covalent and transient systems will allow the development of new polymeric materials with advanced functionality...|$|E
40|$|Liquid waste {{generated}} by the PUREX process for separation of nuclear materials is concentrated and stored in Type IV single-shell carbon steel tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The Type IV tanks for this waste do not have cooling coils and have not undergone heat treatment to <b>stress-relieve</b> the tanks. After the waste is concentrated by evaporation, it becomes very alkaline and can cause stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and pitting corrosion of the tank materials. SRS has experienced leakage from non-stress-relieved waste tanks constructed of A 285 carbon steel and pitting of A 212 carbon steel tanks in the vapor space. An investigation of tank materials has been undertaken at SRS to develop {{a basic understanding of}} caustic SCC of A 285 and A 212 grade carbon steels exposed to aqueous solutions, primarily containing sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium nitrate (NaNO{sub 3 }), and sodium nitrite (NaNO{sub 2 }) at temperatures relevant to the operating conditions of both the F and H area plants. This report presents the results of this corrosion testing program. Electrochemical tests were designed using unstressed coupons in a simulated tank environment. The purpose of this testing was to determine the corrosion susceptibility of the tank materials as a function of chemical concentration, pH, and temperature. A 285 and A 516 (simulates A 212 carbon steel) coupons were used to investigate differences in the corrosion of these carbon steels. Electrochemical testing included measurement of the corrosion potential and polarization resistance as well as cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP) testing of coupons. From the CPP experiments, corrosion characteristics were determined including: corrosion potential (E{sub corr}), pitting or breakdown potential (E{sub pit}), and repassivation potential (E{sub prot}). CPP results showed no indications of localized corrosion, such as pitting, and all samples showed the formation of a stable passive layer as evidenced by the positive hysteresis during the scan. Analysis of the CPP data was performed to compare the corrosion susceptibility of the samples under different environmental conditions. Test results indicated that the most important factors affecting corrosion of the steel are the solution temperature, hydroxide concentration, and the material used in constructing the tanks. Variables that did not significantly affect the corrosion susceptibility of the steel were the nitrate or nitrite concentration and the atmosphere in the tank. The passivation current of the coupons increased exponentially with temperature. Longer-term studies of the passivation current are suggested based on results from the literature for iron in highly caustic environments. Polarization resistance studies showed a significant increase in corrosion rate at 125 C and 12 M hydroxide concentration when compared with tests at lower temperatures and lower hydroxide concentrations. Within the temperature and pH range of these tests, iron oxide, Fe{sub 3 }O{sub 4 }, becomes unstable and could account for the increased corrosion susceptibility. The applicability of these conditions should be confirmed and detailed surface studies should be conducted to determine the corrosion resistance of A 285 and A 516 carbon steels under these conditions. Surface science studies should also be conducted to determine the role of the carbon steel composition in preventing corrosion under these conditions...|$|E

Prior to the welding, the material was double tempered at 538 C (1, 000 F). After welding, only part of the material was stress relieved at 510 C (950 F) for 3 h.
