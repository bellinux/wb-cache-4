The {{thermal desorption unit}} adopted electromagnetic induction heating during continuous conveying of materials by double screws, and the handling capability was 250  L/h. Thermal desorption test at different temperatures (300 – 550  °C) were carried out in conditions of residence times of 7  min and 12  min respectively. Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) content of samples after treatment reduced to less than 1 % when heating temperature up to 450  °C, and the oil removal rate was about 95 %. The residual content of TPH dropped to 0.3 % when heating temperature at 550  °C and residence time reached to 12  min. The temperature distribution of the material in heating bed obtained by numerical simulation based on test operating conditions. A temperature rising lag area of materials <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> <b>section</b> of barrel was found when heating. The material temperature in this area was only about 55 – 65 % of the setting value when residence time reach to 12  min, while the other areas temperatures could up to above 90 %, and the deviation between the material temperature and the setting value became obvious when the temperature is higher.|$|R

40|$|<b>Slope</b> {{failures}} <b>in</b> <b>fill</b> <b>slopes</b> {{formed by}} loosely compacted, completely decomposed granite in Hong Kong occur commonly during intense tropical rainstorms. The stress path greatly influences the shear {{strength of the}} soil mass, and is therefore crucial to the identification of slope-failure mechanisms. The soil mass {{in this case is}} largely unsaturated. In situ hydrologic response to rainstorms indicates that soil suction is reduced by rainfall infiltration, which often becomes the triggering factor <b>in</b> initiating <b>slope</b> instability. The constant dead-load tests on unsaturated, loosely compacted, completely decomposed granite appropriately simulate the field stress path of rainfall-induced fill-slope failure by reducing suction. The tests indicate that matric suction contributes to the dilative or contractive behavior of the unsaturated soils. The anisotropically consolidated undrained triaxial tests demonstrate the consistently contractive behavior of the specimens. On this basis, we delineate the in situ stress conditions leading to the initiation of rainfall-induced fill-slope failure, and the stress paths of the transformation from local failures to flowage. Based on a systematic study of fill-slope case records in Hong Kong, implications of such mechanisms on fill-slope stability are given. © ASCE / JUNE 2004. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

30|$|This ideal {{splitting}} method is introduced in our proposed reservoir design {{as shown in}} Fig.  1 d. First a column L 1 is filled by liquid pulled from the <b>filling</b> <b>section</b> of the reservoir. Next, liquid is further transported across arc section A and placed on second linear section L 2. Both L 1, L 2 are divided into slender (instead of square) electrode segments. Arc A is also composed of four sectors. All of these segments can be individually addressed. Note that, A is not filled with liquid and only used to carry liquid to L 2. Since L 1 and L 2 create a right angle, liquid on those two sections touch each other diagonally just before pinch-off, {{which is similar to}} that in Fig.  1 c. Later, liquid column L 1 is held in place by activating all of the electrodes while pulling force is applied on the liquid on L 2 from left. Without generating any elongated tail, pinch-off happens very close to the junction point of L 1 and L 2. Like the ideal splitting scheme already discussed and shown in Fig.  1 c, the tail formed after pinch-off is expected to be very tiny in this case and therefore dispensed volume should be very accurate. Also, because the liquid column L 1 is fixed, the volume <b>in</b> the <b>filling</b> <b>section</b> is not likely to affect the meniscus formation in the neck and thus will not affect location of the pinch-off point. The use of the slender electrodes in L 1 and L 2 serves two additional purposes: first, it controls the deformation thus making sure that the necking will happen very close to the L 1 –L 2 junction and second, it speeds up the process by enhancing the transport velocity of liquid [35]. Due to the latter advantage, this reservoir design would also give higher droplet generating rate as well.|$|R

MSE/Soil Nail hybrid {{earth retaining}} walls use a soil nailed wall in the cut section and an MSE wall <b>in</b> the <b>fill</b> <b>section.</b> The paper demonstrates the results of instrumentation and monitoring an MSE/Soil Nail hybrid retaining wall system.

In order to evaluate the global Factor of Safety (FOS) of the soil nail wall portion using the conventional limit-equilibrium design methods (LEM), two different methodologies to simulate the effect of the upper MSE walls were proposed. The obtained results of numerical and limit equilibrium approaches as a design methodology are presented for such type of walls, in this paper. The design of hybrid MSE/SN walls is complicated as it is a composite of two different reinforcement techniques, traditional limit equilibrium approaches cannot be used alone for design of such walls, it shall be supported by numerical methods for estimation of the global factor of safety and failure surface. The limit equilibrium approaches can be used for the estimation of internal stability and facing connection for both soil nails and mechanically stabilized walls...|$|R

When PDMS is irradiated with UV light its refractive index increases [7].
