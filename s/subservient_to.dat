5|$|During {{the martial}} law era, Manila became a hot-bed of {{resistance}} activity as youth and student demonstrators repeatedly {{clashed with the}} police and military which were <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> the Marcos regime. After decades of resistance, the non-violent People Power Revolution (predecessor to the peaceful-revolutions that toppled the iron-curtain in Europe), ousted the authoritarian Marcos from power.|$|E

5|$|Lord Keith {{stated in}} the {{judgement}} {{that there was no}} reason why this reasoning could not apply in English law. He stated that following the Matrimonial Causes Acts, the definition of marriage had moved from Hale's time from where the wife was <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> her husband into a contract of equals.|$|E
5|$|Media in the Eastern Bloc was {{an organ}} of the state, {{completely}} reliant on and <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> the communist party, with radio and television organizations being state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local communist party. Soviet propaganda used Marxist philosophy to attack capitalism, claiming labor exploitation and war-mongering imperialism were inherent in the system.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, Charles IV of Luxembourg {{was elected}} emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. In {{consequence}} of an alliance between {{his father and}} Pope Clement VI, the relentless enemy of the emperor Louis IV, Charles was chosen Roman king in opposition to Louis {{by some of the}} princes at Rhens. He had previously promised to be <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> Clement, he confirmed the papacy in the possession of wide territories, promised to annul the acts of Louis against Clement, to take no part in Italian affairs, and to defend and protect the church.|$|E

50|$|Leuu: The Orcs {{are divided}} into two tribes: the Waw-Raws and the Ree-Waw-Raws. Leuu is the {{chieftain}} of the Waw-Raws, a warlike tribe whose military prowess far exceeds that of the Goblins. However, due to their low intelligence and endless internecine strife, they are surprisingly content in their <b>subservient</b> position <b>to</b> the Goblins.|$|R
5|$|The Woman's Bible is {{a two-part}} non-fiction book, written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and a {{committee}} of 26 women, published in 1895 and 1898 to challenge the traditional position of religious orthodoxy that woman should be <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> man. By producing the book, Stanton wished to promote a radical liberating theology, one that stressed self-development. The book attracted {{a great deal of}} controversy and antagonism at its introduction.|$|E
5|$|Caesar held {{both the}} {{dictatorship}} and the tribunate, and alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship. In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers. This made his person sacrosanct, {{gave him the}} power to veto the senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. In 46 BC, Caesar was given censorial powers, which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans. Caesar then raised {{the membership of the}} Senate to 900. This robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made it increasingly <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> him. While the assemblies continued to meet, he submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment. Thus, the assemblies became powerless and were unable to oppose him.|$|E
5|$|However, Soeprapto {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with Minister of Justice Moeljatno {{over the role of}} the prosecution. Moeljatno took the traditional view that the prosecutor general's office, {{under the control of the}} Ministry of Justice during the Dutch colonial period, was in a similar station after independence; on the other hand, Soeprapto believed that the function of the prosecutor general was half executive and half judicial and as such demanded to be accountable only to the cabinet. This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the prosecutor general <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> the Minister of Justice, which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from prosecutors and police officers. However, the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, Korea was invaded in 1627 {{and again}} in 1636 by the Manchus, {{who went on to}} conquer China and {{establish}} the Qing dynasty, after which the Joseon dynasty recognized Qing suzerainty. Though Joseon respected its traditional <b>subservient</b> position <b>to</b> China, there was persistent loyalty for the perished Ming and disdain for the Manchus, who were regarded as barbarians.|$|R
50|$|In the 1350 BC {{correspondence}} of 382 - letters, {{called the}} Amarna letters, the Prostration formula {{is usually the}} opening <b>subservient</b> remarks <b>to</b> the addressee, the Egyptian pharaoh. The formula is based on prostration, namely reverence and submissiveness. Often the letters are from vassal rulers or vassal city-states, especially in Canaan but also in other localities.|$|R
50|$|Among his successes was the Treaty of Annemasse {{which the}} Count of Geneva and the Dauphin of Viennois {{accepted}} <b>subservient</b> roles <b>to</b> {{him as his}} vassals.

5|$|Not all of {{the monks}} were {{attracted}} by Symeon's zealous approach. Symeon attempted to reform the Byzantine monasteries, where monks had become <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> the emperor and had acquired large holdings of property, libraries, and art. His writings and teachings were aimed at returning the monasteries to their traditional role in the early church, urging the monks {{to take up a}} life of simplicity, asceticism, purity of heart, and constant prayer. The strict monastic discipline for which Symeon aimed upset several monks in the monastery. Symeon also took a more emotional approach to worship, suggesting that a monk shouldn't take the sacrament without tears. The introduction of vegetarian meals, along with other unique practices to instill discipline and humility, also caused some displeasure among the monks.|$|E
5|$|Vortigaunts are {{a fictional}} extra-dimensional {{species in the}} Half-Life series of video games by Valve Corporation. In Half-Life and its three expansions, Vortigaunts are {{frequently}} encountered by the player as hostile non-player characters in Half-Life and later as allies in Half-Life 2. The Vortigaunts are depicted in Half-Life as being an enslaved race in an alternative dimension called Xen, <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> a large creature called the Nihilanth, which itself is a slave to undisclosed masters. In Half-Life 2, the Vortigaunts have broken free of their slavery, and actively assist the player and other humans in resisting the Combine occupation of Earth.|$|E
5|$|During the Chou Dynasty, {{the upper}} class {{considered}} daughters-in-law as commodities of the husband's parents, not the husbands. This meant that wives had to be <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> parents-in-law. They were expected to have impeccable manners, including refraining from coughing and sneezing {{in the presence of}} their husbands' parents. Wives could not leave their rooms or accept gifts from relatives without permission. Refusal to turn gifts over to parents-in-law lead to physical abuse and expulsion from the family. In addition, wives were required to serve in-laws, including helping them bathe, arranging their bedding, and cooking. People placed a strong emphasis on food preparation in Ancient China. Cooking {{was one of the most}} time-consuming tasks for wives because of traditional rituals and high expectations for the taste and appeal of food.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Han society, {{which had}} a strict {{separation}} of responsibilities along gender lines, and placed women in a <b>subservient</b> role <b>to</b> men, the Khitan women of the Liao dynasty performed {{many of the same}} functions that the Khitan men did. Khitan women were taught how to hunt, and managed family herds, flocks, finances, and property when their husbands were at war. Upper-class women were able to hold governmental and military posts.|$|R
50|$|A single simple chiefdom is {{generally}} {{composed of a}} central community surrounded by or near a number of smaller subsidiary communities. All of the communities recognize the authority of a single kin group or individual with hereditary centralized power, dwelling in the primary community. Each community will have its own leaders, which are usually in a tributary and/or <b>subservient</b> relationship <b>to</b> the ruling elite of the primary community.|$|R
5|$|From January 1996 onwards, Ranariddh's {{relations}} with Hun Sen {{began to show}} signs of tension. Hun Sen submitted a government circular to reinstate 7 January as a national holiday, the anniversary of Phnom Penh's liberation from the Khmer Rouge by Vietnamese forces. Ranariddh added his signature to the circular, which incurred the ire of Sihanouk and several FUNCINPEC leaders. A few days later, apparently to tone down dissatisfaction from party members, Ranariddh publicly accused the Army of Vietnam of encroaching into the territories of four Cambodian provinces bordering it. As Widyono saw it, Ranariddh intended to test Hun Sen's response to his accusations, of which the latter chose to remain quiet. During a closed-door FUNCINPEC meeting in the later part of January 1996, party members criticised Hun Sen and the CPP for monopolizing government power, and also chided Ranariddh for being too <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> Hun Sen.|$|E
5|$|In late antiquity, {{historic}} accounts {{become much}} more diffuse, and the Iazyges generally cease to be mentioned as a tribe. In the late 4thcentury, two Sarmatian peoples were mentioned, the Argaragantes and the Limigantes, who lived {{on opposite sides of}} the Tisza river. One theory is that these two tribes were formed when the Iazyges were conquered by the Roxolani, with the Iazyges becoming the Limigantes, and the Roxolani becoming the Argaragantes. Another theory is that a group of Slavic tribesmen gradually migrated into the area, <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> the Iazyges, and the Iazyges became known as the Argaragantes, and the Slavs were the Limigantes. Regardless of which is true, in the 5th century both of them were conquered by the Goths, and, by the time of Attila, they were absorbed into the Huns.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs often pledged various {{items of}} state regalia as {{collateral}} for loans throughout the Middle Ages. At {{some point in}} the 14thcentury, all of the state regalia were moved to the White Tower at the Tower of London due to a series of successful and attempted thefts in a part of Westminster Abbey that housed state regalia. The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey. Arches topped with a monde and cross were added to images of StEdward's Crown by the time of HenryIV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor HenryV. Known as a closed or imperial crown, the arches symbolised the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> no one but God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
50|$|Early Fulbe {{settlers}} {{entered the}} Adamawa from present-day Nigeria or northern Cameroon {{as early as}} the 13th century. These settlers and nomads were never numerous, however, and they often held <b>subservient</b> status <b>to</b> other tribes. Over time, however, the steady stream of Fulbe immigrants allowed Fulbe communities to spring up in many areas. These early Fulbe converted to Islam sometime in the 17th century, beginning with the settled, or town, Fulbe.|$|R
40|$|Although librarians have {{traditionally}} defended intellectual freedom, the American Library Association (ALA) tends {{to treat it}} as a local management issue. As librarianship has become increasingly technical defense of intellectual freedom has diminished. Censorship generates self-censorship and demonstrates a <b>subservient</b> relation <b>to</b> authority detrimental to collection development. Using instances from his professional life, the author argues that censorship infantilizes patrons, discourages critical thinking, and is counterproductive to institutions of higher learning...|$|R

5|$|The Manche Ch'ol were {{integrated}} into a regional trade network that included their Itza and Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours, and involved the exchange of Manche produce such as cacao, annatto and vanilla for salt, the only Maya source of which was controlled by the Itza after the Spanish conquest of the province of Acalan. This trade monopoly was maintained by force {{on the part of}} the Itza, who vigorously ensured that the Manche Ch'ol remained <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> them. After the Manche towns on the coast of Belize fell under Spanish control in the 16th century, they continued to have close links with the independent inland Manche settlements. Trade continued and intermarriage was common. The towns in the Cancuén River drainage traded via land and riverine routes with both the independent Itza (notably with Nojpetén) and with colonial Verapaz (principally with Cobán and Cahabón).|$|E
5|$|The central {{conflict}} in many Final Fantasy games {{focuses on a}} group of characters battling an evil, and sometimes ancient, antagonist that dominates the game's world. Stories frequently involve a sovereign state in rebellion, with the protagonists taking part in the rebellion. The heroes are often destined to defeat the evil, and occasionally gather {{as a direct result of}} the antagonist's malicious actions. Another staple of the series is the existence of two villains; the main villain is not always who it appears to be, as the primary antagonist may actually be <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> another character or entity. The main antagonist introduced at the beginning of the game is not always the final enemy, and the characters must continue their quest beyond what appears to be the final fight.|$|E
5|$|Though the French {{presented}} {{themselves as}} liberators, they behaved like conquerors. After acrimonious {{negotiations between the}} representatives of the new Batavian Republic and those of the French Republic, a harsh Treaty of The Hague was concluded on 16 May 1795. Apart from imposing territorial concessions and a huge indemnity, this obligated the Dutch to maintain a French army of occupation of 25,000 men. This changed the Dutch republic from a client state of England and Prussia into a French one; henceforth it would conduct a foreign and military policy dictated by France, where its predecessor had followed British dictates since 1787 (an offensive and defensive alliance of the two republics was part of the treaty), while its economic policies would in effect also be made <b>subservient</b> <b>to</b> the interests of France. However, this did not mean that it lost its independence in all respects. The program of reform that the Dutch revolutionaries attempted to put in place (however constrained by the political realities of the French revolution as this was to progress) was mostly driven by indigenous needs and aspirations. The political events in the Netherlands were mainly derived from Dutch initiative, with some notable exceptions. The French were responsible for {{at least one of the}} coups d'état, and the French ambassador often acted as a proconsul.|$|E
50|$|Dalinar Kholin's Alethi armies won a {{fleeting}} victory at a terrible cost: The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, which now sweeps {{the world with}} destruction, and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and <b>subservient</b> parshmen <b>to</b> the horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must {{come to grips with}} the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} reevaluation of {{selected}} short stories by Dorothy Parker. Although receptions of Parker's work have been predominantly negative, {{this is not}} seen as cause for lament, but rather for a revision of literary valuing practices and the canonical paradigms they support. Traditional assumptions {{about the status of}} so-called "minor" literature and its <b>subservient</b> relation <b>to</b> canonical works are rejected in favour of a revised appreciation of the qualities specific to minor modes of writing...|$|R
500|$|As the Cold War grew hotter after 1947, Innis grew {{increasingly}} {{hostile to the}} United States. He warned repeatedly that Canada was becoming a <b>subservient</b> colony <b>to</b> its much more powerful southern neighbor. [...] "We are indeed fighting for our lives," [...] he warned, pointing especially to the [...] "pernicious influence of American advertising.... We can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against American imperialism in all its attractive guises." [...] His anti-Americanism influenced some younger scholars, including Donald Creighton.|$|R
