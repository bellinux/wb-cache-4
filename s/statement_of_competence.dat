As elements of human material culture these houses represent the physical objectification of invisible culture. They are the products of a culturally dictated mental process of design, and in their form reflect the successful mediation by their creators of a set of binary oppositions common to all human experience. The mental rules that guide this process of design, and therefore account for the physical form of the object, are called the artifactual competence. Because, as a product <b>of</b> this <b>competence,</b> an artifact has implicit within its form the set of rules that account for its being, it is theoretically possible, through an inductive analysis of artifactual form, to isolate this set of relational rules.

40|$|The {{competence}} and learning outcomes approach, which intends to improve effective performance of academic staff and students, is becoming dominant in today’s higher education. This {{was quite different}} 15 years ago. This contribution aims to offer insight in the reforms initiated and implemented, by posing and answering the questions why the time was appropriate — by identifying and analysing the underlying conditions — and in what way the change was shaped — by focusing on terminology required and approaches developed. Central here is the role the Tuning project — launched in 2000 - 2001 — played in this respect. The contribution starts with contextualising {{the situation in the}} 1990 s: the recession and growing unemployment in many European countries {{on the one hand and}} the development of a global society and the challenges the higher educational sector faced at the other. It offers the background for initiating the Tuning project, and the discourse on which its approach is based. In particular, attention is given to choosing the concept <b>of</b> <b>competences,</b> distinguishing subject specific and general/generic ones, as an integrating approach of knowledge, understanding, skills, abilities and attitudes. The approach should serve as a means of integrating a number of main goals as part of the learning and teaching process: strengthening employability and preparing for citizenship besides personal development of the student as a basis for the required educational reform. Tuning’s unique contribution is the alignment of this concept to learning outcomes <b>statements</b> as indicators <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> development and achievement and by relating both concepts to profiling of educational programmes...|$|R

This {{has led to a}} {{need to be able to}} assess and compare professions and their education across the EU and beyond. Historically, in response to the challenge of addressing the needs of persons with difficulties with communication, the profession has developed differently across European countries influenced by linguistic, cultural and socio-political diversity and a range of approaches to medicine, health and education. The NetQues project was set up to establish agreements on areas of commonality in speech and language therapy (pathology) education across the EU and also to look at any differences. The article looks briefly at the history and diversity of the profession in Europe and describes how 65 partners from 31 countries across Europe recruited into a multilateral academic and professional network achieved the project’s goal to delineate the agreed common core competences which are both essential and desirable for a newly qualified speech-language practitioner to work safely and effectively.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an {{empirical}} study which attempts to answer basic questions about translation competence {{as a key}} issue in translation studies, through the conceptual replication of Campbell’s (1998) model to test {{the applicability of the}} model on translating into L 1. It is a process-oriented study which presents a methodology for the testing of the model through the quantitative statistical analysis of the translator’s output. The primary aim is pedagogical and it is carried out in the framework of applied linguistics, translation studies in general and translator training in particular. The study is focused on the investigation of the three components of Campbell’s model: textual competence, disposition and monitoring. Theoretically, the model assumes that the interrelation among these components constitutes the function <b>of</b> the translator’s <b>competence.</b> The study investigates questions regarding the ways in which translators into L 1 vary in regard of the three components. The central question, which represents the ultimate aim, is {{about the extent to which}} these aspects are helpful in characterizing the <b>competence</b> <b>of</b> student-translators as revealed by their individual profiles. The profiles are based on the results of an experiment in which translations of two texts were undertaken by a group of twenty-five participants (L 1 Arabic MA translation students translating from English into Arabic). The findings of the study show that translators into the first language markedly vary in their output in respect to the three components of the model, which confirms its applicability. The current study claims that it has successfully sharpened Campbell’s measure by transforming the behavioural <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> characterizing translation <b>competence</b> into numerical values for each component to make the individual’s competence more easily interpretable. Certainly, numerical values have easily recognizable discrimination ability which makes them suitable to rank translators in a dependable and justifiable way...|$|R

Here, the concept <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> is being explored by focusing on its dimensions and by identifying differ-ences with related terms. The boundary approach <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> heavily depends on a constructivist point of view.
