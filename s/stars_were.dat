5|$|Opposition to heliocentrism and Galileo's {{writings}} combined {{religious and}} scientific objections and were fueled by political events. Scientific opposition came from Tycho Brahe and others and {{arose from the}} fact that, if heliocentrism were true, an annual stellar parallax should be observed, though none was. Copernicus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because the <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> so distant. However, Brahe had countered that, since stars appeared to have measurable size, if the <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> that distant, they would be gigantic, and in fact far larger than the Sun or any other celestial body. In Brahe's system, by contrast, the <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> a little more distant than Saturn, and the Sun and <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> comparable in size.|$|E
5|$|The crest was {{modified}} in 1995 after consultation with a Supporters Forum, with the turrets of the Wolsey Gate {{moved to the}} top of the crest, the yellow background changed to red, the Suffolk Punch given a more dominant physique and the F.C. expanded to Football Club. Three <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> added to the sleeve of the team's away shirt for the 2004–05 season, and also to the home kit for the 2005–06 season.

5|$|Important {{theoretical}} work on {{the physical}} structure of stars occurred during {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century. In 1913, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was developed, propelling the astrophysical study of stars. Successful models were developed to explain the interiors of stars and stellar evolution. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first proposed that <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis. The spectra of <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> further understood through advances in quantum physics. This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined.|$|E

5|$|Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe {{identified}} {{new stars}} {{in the night sky}} (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 Giordano Bruno suggested that the <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that the <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, {{information}} about the types and distances of stars became more readily available.

40|$|It {{is known}} that most visible <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> binary: they have a nearby {{companion}} star, and these two stars orbit around each other.

5|$|Significant {{advances}} in astronomy came {{about with the}} introduction of new technology, including the spectroscope and photography.

A binary <b>star</b> <b>is</b> one kind of double star : a star that resolves visually into two separate <b>stars</b> that <b>are</b> very close together {{as seen from the}} Earth; the other type of double <b>star</b> <b>is</b> an optical double, {{consisting of}} stars of significantly differing distances or velocities which merely appear near each other in the sky but are dynamically unrelated.|$|R
5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{constellation}} was known to exist during the Babylonian period. Ancient sky watchers imagined that prominent arrangements of stars formed patterns, and they associated these with particular aspects of nature or their myths. Twelve of these formations lay along the band of the ecliptic and these became the basis of astrology. Many of the more prominent individual <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> also given names, particularly with Arabic or Latin designations.|$|E
5|$|The current stellar {{classification}} system {{originated in the}} early 20th century, when <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> classified from A to Q based {{on the strength of}} the hydrogen line. It thought that the hydrogen line strength was a simple linear function of temperature. Rather, it was more complicated; it strengthened with increasing temperature, it peaked near 9000K, and then declined at greater temperatures. When the classifications were reordered by temperature, it more closely resembled the modern scheme.|$|E
