40|$|A steady state, {{laminar flow}} coupled with heat transfer, gas-phase and surface chemistry, is numerically solved for the optimal {{design of a}} {{showerhead}} gas delivery system in an axis-symmetrical MOCVD reactor. The design method involves an evolutionary algorithm based on CFD simulations. A finite-volume CFD code for aluminum growth provides the numerical predictions of the growth rate and its spatial variation over the substrate. A multilevel evolutionary algorithm is used to continuously adjust {{the shape of the}} <b>shower</b> <b>plate</b> so as to minimize the spatial variation of the growth rate. A 5 -variable parameterization of the <b>shower</b> <b>plate</b> is investigated and a near-optimal solution is proposed and compared to the original configuration of the <b>shower</b> <b>plate.</b> © The Electrochemical Society...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{demonstrates}} a computational method for shape optimization of a showerhead gas delivery {{system in a}} metal-organic chemical vapor deposition system. The method involves evolutionary algorithms in combination with CFD analysis. The growth rate and its spatial non-uniformity across the substrate are calculated through a finite-volume CFD code, while the task of minimizing the nonuniformity of the growth rate is assigned to a multilevel evolutionary algorithm. Design limitations resulting from {{the operation of the}} actual system are identified and different parameterizations of the <b>shower</b> <b>plate</b> are investigated. Optimal solutions are proposed and compared to the actual <b>shower</b> <b>plate</b> configuration. © 2008 Civil-Comp Press...|$|E
30|$|The plasma {{treatment}} process {{is carried out}} in a vertically placed stainless-steel cylindrical chamber of 40 cm in diameter and 45 cm in length. The chamber is evacuated to a base pressure of 1 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 mbar using a rotary pump (21 m 3 h− 1). Argon gas (purity[*]>[*] 99.9 %) is fed in the chamber through a flat cylindrical gas <b>shower</b> <b>plate</b> (9.25 cm in diameter). The bottom surface of the <b>shower</b> <b>plate</b> contains 60 holes, each having a diameter of 5 [*]×[*] 10 − 2 cm. The RF electrode (10 cm in diameter) is placed horizontally {{at the center of}} the chamber with proper insulation and connected to an RF (13.56 MHz) source (COMDEL-CPS- 500 AS, 0 to 500 W, Gloucester, MA, USA) through an L-type matching network. Cold water is circulated through the electrode so as to keep it cool during the {{plasma treatment}} process. The gas <b>shower</b> <b>plate</b> is placed 5 cm above the RF electrode, and the samples are placed on the surface of the electrode. The Ar plasma treatment is carried out at an RF power of 20 W and treatment time range of 5 to 20 min. The argon gas flow rate is set at 5 sccm (MFC) (Aalborg, Orangeburg, NY, USA) during the whole plasma treatment process. Finally after treatment, the RF power is turned off, and the substrates are allowed to cool in an argon flow (35 sccm) for 15 min. The samples are collected from the RF chamber after 6 h and immediately transferred to a vacuum desiccator.|$|E
60|$|Alice did not at {{all like}} the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to {{introduce}} some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a <b>shower</b> of saucepans, <b>plates,</b> and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. SiC {{nanoparticles}} are synthesized by r. f. {{thermal plasma}} {{chemical vapour deposition}} using a chemical system of SiH 4 -C 2 H 4 -H 2 -Ar. The average particle size is about 30 nm, and its shape is nearly spherical. The product is β-SiC and high pure with total metal impurity of less than 1 ppm. High pure and fully densified SiC body {{can be made by}} hot-pressing the sub-micron sized SiC powder added SiC nanoparticles without any sintering additives. They show electrical conductivity, high thermal conductivity and better properties of thermal shock resistance and chemical resistance compared with conventional SiC ceramics. Furthermore, Al 2 O 3 -SiC nano-composite can be made by using SiC nanoparticles easily. These functional ceramics from nanoparticles are the most promising materials for the semiconductor manufacturing process. Up to now, various sintered parts, such as heater, susceptor, pulse heat tool, <b>shower</b> <b>plate</b> and electrical static chuck, etc. have been developed and widely used in the semiconductor industry...|$|E
