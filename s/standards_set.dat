This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins.

The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.

His economic policies aimed to prevent issues that occurred in other former Soviet states, such as the establishment of oligarchic structures and mass unemployment.

The per-capita Gross national income rose from US$1,423 in 1993 to US$5,830 at the end of 2011.

AIMS: To develop a criterion-referenced <b>standard</b> <b>setting</b> approach for SCT using an adapted Nedelsky approach, to pilot feasibility, and to compare failure rates {{with two other}} methods. METHODS: Second- and third-year medical students were administered a 45 -question SCT and results collated. <b>Standard</b> <b>setting</b> was applied using three approaches: (1) norm-referenced (student cohorts), (2) expert-referenced (student cohort compared to expert mean), and (3) adapted Nedelsky approach using answer key normalization. Feasibility and failure rates were measured. RESULTS: All <b>standard</b> <b>setting</b> approaches were feasible, with 60 additional minutes required for the Nedelsky <b>standard</b> <b>setting</b> exercise. Failure rates between the three approaches were similar (Year 2 : 8. 0 – 9. 8 % and Year 3 : 2. 1 – 7. 6 %), with the adapted Nedelsky approach representing an intermediate option (Year 2 : 8. 0 % and Year 3 : 3. 5 %).

The case is based on extensive interviews with members of the standard-setting board at that time, supplemented with documentary studies. Findings – The paper identifies and discusses five general measures to deal with the immanent resistance to auditing standard setting: alignment of interests, representation, due process, soft texts, and reference to ideology.
