5|$|Madgwick was {{frequently}} absent from his official duties from 1963 to 1966 due to ill health. Nevertheless, from 1964 to 1966, {{he served as}} chairman of the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee. In this capacity, he successfully fended off a decision from the Australian Universities Commission, headed by Leslie H. Martin, that distance (extension) education should not be a university function. Internal student enrolment had increased to 1396 in 1965, a year before Madgwick's retirement. The academic <b>staff</b> <b>had</b> grown from 65 in 1953 to 360 in 1966 and the general <b>staff</b> <b>had</b> increased from 100 in 1954 to 693 in 1966. Research expenditures in 1954 had amounted to £5,286. In 1965 £180,834 was spent on research with £51,328 coming from university funds and the rest from other sources.|$|E
5|$|At 11 am a {{disturbance}} {{started in the}} chapel at Strangeways Prison when some 300 prisoners attacked staff. Those prisoners then gained access to the chapel roof and then broke into the living accommodation in the main prison. Other prisoners, including those on remand, joined in the disturbance and <b>staff</b> <b>had</b> to be withdrawn. The perimeter is secure.|$|E
5|$|At about 10:30, Rybka {{launched}} a frontal attack across the Unac supported {{by at least}} one MG42 machine gun firing into the mouth of the cave. The Germans reached the base of the hill, fifty metres from the cave, but suffered severe casualties in the assault. They were also running low on water. Prior to this attack, Tito and around 20 <b>staff</b> <b>had</b> taken refuge in the cave.|$|E

5|$|Bader's {{staff was}} split into a {{military}} command staff led by Oberst (Colonel) Erich Kewisch and an administrative staff {{under the control}} of SS-Gruppenführer Harald Turner. Kewisch's <b>staff</b> <b>had</b> direct control of the regional defence battalions and worked with the military forces of occupation in the territory. Turner's staff supervised the Serbian puppet regime, the German commandants of the four military districts and the police and security forces.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Frederick {{thought the}} sounds of the battle were either an outpost {{skirmish}} or the Croats, who apparently started their days with regular firing of their weapons. His <b>staff</b> <b>had</b> trouble rousing him from bed, but he was soon alerted when Prussian cannons, captured by the Austrians, started to fire on his own camp.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Hipólito Vieytes {{released}} a new newspaper shortly afterwards, the Agriculture, Trade and Industry Weekly, with Castelli in the staff. The editorial <b>staff</b> <b>had</b> {{meetings at the}} house of Saturnino Rodríguez Peña, discussing ideas for technical improvements in agriculture, removal of trade restrictions, development, manufacturing, and other topics. The newspaper also published the biographies of some Founding Fathers of the United States, such as Benjamin Franklin.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} pitched and written by John Swartzwelder. The writing <b>staff</b> <b>had</b> {{to find a}} new angle for Homer's weight problems, as the idea had been used several times before. This was {{emphasized}} in this episode when Marge does not seem to care that Homer {{is going to try to}} lose weight again.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{values for}} the set were quite good. The production <b>staff</b> <b>had</b> reproduced an effective-looking replica of {{the bridge of the}} U.S.S Enterprise. As the scene began, the viewscreen of the ship depicted the U.S.S Enterprise being pursued by a type of automobile commonly manufactured in the United States and from the time period when Star Trek was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The resort's <b>staff</b> <b>had</b> {{left a note}} in {{a message}} book at the swimming-pool {{reception}} area, asking that the same table, which overlooked the apartments, be block-booked for 20:30 for the McCanns and friends every evening {{for the last four}} evenings of the holiday. The message said the group's children were asleep in the apartments. Madeleine's mother believes the abductor may have seen the note.|$|E

In 1943 the synagogue {{changed its name to}} Temple Israel, and by the late 1940s membership had almost doubled from its low point in the 1930s. Ettelson retired in 1954, and was succeeded by Jimmy Wax.|$|E
5|$|Trinidad and Tobago's athletes {{arrived in}} Beijing's Olympic Village early in August. The {{athletic}} contingent of Trinidad and Tobago's team arrived in Beijing from Finland on August 5, 2008, but spent only one night {{before leaving for}} a training camp in nearby South Korea. The athletics team returned on August 11. Sharpshooter Roger Daniel, along with the entirety of Trinidad and Tobago Olympic Committee's administrative and medical <b>staff,</b> <b>had</b> arrived in the Olympic Village by August 3, 2008.|$|E

5|$|A {{scene in}} the episode shows Grampa and Bart driving to Branson with Marge's car, {{listening}} to the radio. Because the scene consists entirely of auditive gags, the Simpsons <b>staff</b> <b>had</b> difficulty figuring out what to show visually during the scene. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Jean explained that these scenes “get a really big laugh at the table,” but are subsequently hard for the animators. The scene makes use of a repeated background, an animation technique made famous by Hanna-Barbera in order to cut budget.|$|E
5|$|After {{the recent}} Polish Campaign, the German Army staff {{analysis}} had been rigorous in its analysis of that battle. The Army's General <b>Staff</b> <b>had</b> assessed {{the problems of}} leadership, tactics, command and control to improve effectiveness. It appears that Schumacher's fighter units did not {{do the same and}} were too busy congratulating themselves on their success. There is little evidence that the Luftwaffe took anything like the Army's approach in Poland, following their own victory at Heligoland Bight. The historian for the Luftwaffes General Staff noted it was only exploited for propaganda, despite the operational problems and warnings the battle had flagged for attacker and defender.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} shooter {{game in the}} Final Fantasy series, the game's <b>staff</b> <b>had</b> various {{problems}} during development, although producer Yoshinori Kitase found the experience challenging, and added role-playing elements {{in order to make}} the game more entertaining for traditional fans of the main series. When Dirge of Cerberus was released outside Japan, several aspects of the gameplay were modified in order to make it more appealing. A mobile phone tie-in was also released in 2006, while in 2008, Square republished the game in Japan with the updates made for the Western versions. Although the game has sold 1.5 million copies worldwide as of 2011, it has received a mixed critical reaction.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day, tens of {{thousands}} of defenders had been killed or captured. The remaining garrisons in the Gerfan and Ponticelli sectors were completely isolated. The logistical and administrative units were being overrun. Recognising that the situation was hopeless, General Bergonzoli and his <b>staff</b> <b>had</b> departed on foot for Tobruk during the afternoon, in a party of about 120 men. General Giuseppe Tellera, the commander of the Italian Tenth Army, considered the possibility of sending a force to relieve the Bardia fortress but in the end concluded that such an operation had no chance of success.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower favored Shoup {{because he}} feared other {{officers}} {{spent too much}} time in political affairs, and felt Shoup would reduce the influence of the military industrial complex. Immediately after his appointment, Shoup sought to place new officers in key positions, in an attempt to overhaul the leadership of the Marine Corps. He and Pate disagreed over some of the new appointments, as Shoup transferred many senior officers and encouraged others to retire. Shoup later wrote he felt the Joint Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>had</b> an undue weight in the direction of military strategy. He also sought to curtail politicking by lower-level Marine officers seeking career advancement.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{fighting}} {{broke out}} on the Plain of Jars as the members of each political grouping chose sides. Souvanna called upon the U.S. for support and was answered in the affirmative by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was eager to support a rightist/neutralist alliance in Laos. In November 1963 General Maxwell D. Taylor, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>had</b> proposed that U.S. armed reconnaissance missions be conducted over Laos {{as part of a}} two phase program that would warn Hanoi of U.S. determination to support the Saigon government. The missions were to take place along North Vietnamese infiltration routes then developing in the Laotian panhandle.|$|E
