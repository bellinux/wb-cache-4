25|$|Micropropagation, {{also known}} as tissue culture, is the {{practice}} of rapidly multiplying <b>stock</b> <b>plant</b> material to produce {{a large number of}} progeny plants. Micropropagation uses in vitro division of small pieces in a sterile environment, where they first produce proliferations of tissue, which are then separated into small pieces that are treated differently so that they produce roots and new stem tissue. The steps in the process are regulated by different ratios of plant growth regulators. Many commercial organizations have produced cannas this way, and specifically the “Island Series” of cannas was introduced by means of mass-produced plants using this technique. However, cannas have a reputation for being difficult micropropagation candidates.|$|E

It reaches only about [...] in cultivation, but has proven difficult to grow. The Dorrigo waratah has been successfully cultivated at the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra in a sheltered position in part-shade with {{a thick layer of}} mulch. It is propagated most easily by seed, which is ripe from February to June and keeps for around twelve months. Seedlings often perish when they reach [...] high, and are difficult to transplant. It has also been grown at Mount Tomah Botanic Garden, where it was noted to be exacting in its requirements, needing very good drainage as well as a sheltered location to survive. It is slow growing; specimens planted in 1989 have been flowering since 1999. The considerably easier to grow Queensland tree waratah (A. flammeum) has been considered as a <b>stock</b> <b>plant</b> for grafting. The pinkish red timber has been used for making cabinets and furniture. It is soft and light, weighing 500kg (1100lb) per cubic metre. The cut flowers have a long vase life.|$|E

Total biomass, leafbiomass, leaf area and number of shoots produced during the 3 years period were measured. Increasing levels of applied nitrogen till 400 mg N L- 1 led to a significant increase of both biomass and shoot production. However, these productions were not significantly affected when N fertilization increased from 400 to 800 mg N L- 1. Increasing levels of applied nitrogen also led to an increase of: i) total leaf area ii) specific leaf area (29 % increase) and iii) leaf area ratio (13 % increase), showing that with a higher N availability <b>stock</b> <b>plants</b> tend to improve their photosynthetic apparatus.
