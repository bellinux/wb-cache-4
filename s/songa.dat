2500|$|Coelacanths {{have been}} caught {{off the coast of}} Tanzania since 2004. Two {{coelacanths}} were initially reported captured off <b>Songa</b> Mnara, a small island {{off the edge of the}} Indian Ocean in August 2003. A spate of 19 more specimens of these extremely rare fishes weighing between 25 and 80kg were reported netted in the space of the next five months, with another specimen captured in January 2005. A coelacanth weighing as much as 110kg was reported by the Observer newspaper in 2006. Officials of the Tanga Coastal Zone Conservation and Development Programme, which has a long-term strategy for protecting the species, see a connection with the timing of the captures with trawling - especially by [...] Japanese vessels - near the coelacanth's habitat, as within a couple of days of trawlers casting their nets, coelacanths have turned up in deep-water gill nets intended for sharks. The sudden appearance of the coelacanths off Tanzania has raised real worries about its future due to damage done to the coelacanth population by the effects of indiscriminate trawling methods and habitat damage.|$|E

50|$|The {{remains of}} Shenshou were {{discovered}} along with fossils {{of two other}} extinct squirrel-like animals, Xianshou <b>songae</b> and Xianshou linglong, in strata dating back 160 million years. The animals were found {{to belong to a}} group referred to as haramiyids, now identifiable as early mammals. They lived alongside another group of small rodent-like animals, the multituberculates, which were already accepted as mammals. This discovery has pushed the date of the origin of mammals back to the Late Triassic, the period in which the haramiyid-multituberculate clade, Allotheria, originated, about 220 million to 200 million years ago. Haramiyids were previously known from fragments of teeth and jaw, but the less complete remains had not established whether they were mammals. The fossils found consisted of a skull, teeth and parts of the skeleton, which clearly indicate that Shenshou - and the other haramiyids - are mammals. Until this was established, mammals were thought to have originated in the Middle Jurassic, which lasted from 174 million to 164 million years ago.|$|R

40|$|Song {{is a short}} poem which {{contains}} lyrics. Lyrics of the song contain figurative language {{that is used to}} say something rather than the ordinary way. It is because songs illustrates the real life, includes conflicts, problems, and other aspects of life. This study focused on figurative languages used in Barry ManilowÂ’s song in even now albums. More specifically, it was intended to describe: 1) the kinds of figurative language found in Barry ManilowÂ’s album Â“Even NowÂ” and 2) the meanings of figurative language found in Barry ManilowÂ’s album Â“Even NowÂ”. This research used a descriptive qualitative design because there was no treatment as an experimental research and just attempted to present the information concerning with the study on figurative language and meaning at Â“Barry ManilowÂ” <b>songÂ’s</b> lyrics. Moreover, objective approach employed because the writer focused his analysis on the literary work which was independent from many factors like the authorÂ’s education, the authorÂ’s life background, and also the audience. After analyzing the songs, the writer found that the composer of the songs used some figurative language to describe his feelings. They include seven hyperboles, two similes, three personifications, two metaphors, and one symbol. Through the detail meaning that are already found, it is shown that the lyrics meaning in figurative language cannot be understood literary, it needs sensitivity from the listeners. The word in figurative language sometimes has different meaning or it is not the real meaning at that expression. Furthermore, the composer used those figurative languages in order to beautify, startle, refresh, exaggerate and give obvious imagination of his feeling in his lyrics {{in order to make the}} listener understand what he means...|$|R
