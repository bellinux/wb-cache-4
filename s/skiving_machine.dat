50|$|In {{deep hole}} machining, a roller {{burnishing}} tool is often combined with skiving knives {{on the same}} tool. The skiving knives pass first, scraping the inside layer of metal, followed by the burnishing rollers, which cold work the tube to create a mirror surface finish. Skive-burnishing is often used in hydraulic cylinder applications. This process can happen on a deep hole drilling machine or a dedicated <b>skiving</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a {{step by step}} approach to the design, assembly and final testing of a high resolution electro-mechanical actuator which will {{be an integral part}} of an automated skiving process used in the shoe manufacturing industry. It is referred to as a <b>skiving</b> <b>machine</b> in this thesis. The thesis provides the necessary background information as to the reasons for replacing a previous machine and then investigates the features considered suitable for incorporation into the new <b>skiving</b> <b>machine.</b> An investigation is carried" out into the desired objectives of the new design and the components to be used. A discussion then follows into the most desirable design systems to be considered for the <b>skiving</b> <b>machine.</b> It is concluded that a system comprising, of- actuating pins, levers, transmission wires and,, solenoids has the most ' appropriate combination of I, characteristics for a satisfactory machine, a' detailed description of the completed design and its parameters is given in relation to the initial objectives. There follows a description of the manufacture' and assembly based upon the design principles. The thesis then describes the performance of the machine and evaluates its skiving capability. Finally, suggestions for future improvements and further integration of the automation process in shoe manufacturing are made...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a successful attempt to identify angular movement of leather components, when transported from one operation to another, by a conveyor system. The automated manufacturing process of skiving leather components was utilised for this research. Skiving is the localised thinning of the leather components {{to enable the}} joining of these without forming thick and unsightly joints. This process had been automated, but its performance could be enhanced by combining an additional sensing system. The research work was directed towards integrating a relatively small and low-cost form of sensing system onto a dynamic matrix <b>skiving</b> <b>machine.</b> Two key areas of the research were the identification of suitable sensor technology and {{the investigation of the}} environment within which they operate. The sensors form a vital and necessary part of any type of identification process and are used to acquire relevant data. The thesis {{describes a}} variety of sensor technologies and their suitability for use in restrictive environments. These environmental restrictions of the skiving process and the component material influence the choice of sensor. Following the study of sensor technologies, the second phase was aimed at implementing an automatic position sensing system. Therefore the main specification of the system was to detect the leather components, and their orientation prior to, and following transportation through the process. The final part of this work presents the results obtained from the introduction of the sensing arrays. It also identifies areas that may be investigated further to improve the system, concerning the particular restricted environment utilised in this research...|$|E
50|$|In 1898, {{the company}} entered the machine {{building}} industry by producing cold circular metal sawing machines and saw blade <b>skiving</b> <b>machines</b> {{as well as}} thread cutting machines. On 5 January 1900, the original company was superseded by „Gebr. Heller Maschinenfabrik GmbH“ founded by the brothers Ernst (1866-1936) and Hermann Heller.|$|R
50|$|<b>Skiving</b> or {{scarfing}} <b>machines</b> cut material off in slices, usually metal, {{but also}} leather or laminates. The process {{is used instead}} of rolling the material to shape when the material must not be work hardened, or must not shed minute slivers of metal later which is common in cold rolling processes.|$|R
50|$|Hyco uses a {{large number}} of {{manufacturing}} processes in order to produce their final products. The processes include rod and tube machining and grinding, custom metal <b>machining,</b> component <b>machining,</b> <b>skive</b> and roller burnishing, friction and inertia welding, plating, painting, and hydraulic component assembly. Robotic and CNC machines are used in many of these processes. Several plants specialize in large capacity machining and handling the very heavy, oversized components used to produce very large bore, very long stroke hydraulic rod and telescoping cylinders.|$|R
