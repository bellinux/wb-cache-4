50|$|The ETCS {{standard}} has {{listed a}} number of older Automatic Train Controls (ATC) as Class B systems. While they are set to obsolescence, the older line side <b>signal</b> <b>information</b> can be read by using Specific Transmission Modules (STM) hardware and fed the Class B <b>signal</b> <b>information</b> to a new ETCS onboard safety control system for partial supervision. In practice an alternative transition scheme is used where an older ATC is rebased to use Eurobalises. This leverages {{the fact that a}} Eurobalise can transmit multiple information packets and the reserved national datagram (packet number 44) can encode the signal values from the old system in parallel with ETCS datagram packets. The older train-born ATC system is equipped with an additional Eurobalise reader that converts the datagram signals. This allows for a longer transitional period where the old ATC and Eurobalises are attached on the sleepers until all trains have a Eurobalise reader. The newer ETCS-compliant trains can be switched to an ETCS operation scheme by a software update of the onboard train computer.|$|E
