50|$|French {{polishing}} became {{prominent in}} the 18th century. In the Victorian era, French polishing was commonly used on mahogany and other expensive timbers. It was considered the best finish for fine furniture and string instruments such as pianos and guitars. The process was very labour-intensive, and many manufacturers abandoned the technique around 1930, preferring the cheaper and quicker techniques of <b>spray</b> <b>finishing</b> nitrocellulose lacquer and abrasive buffing. In Britain, instead of abrasive buffing, a fad of pullover is used {{in much the same}} way as traditional French polishing. This slightly melts the sprayed surface and has the effect of filling the grain and burnishing at the same time to leave a 'French polished' look.|$|E

I n recent years, the appli-caticn of these techniques to leather finishing has been studied to improve finish utilization and reduce solvent emission.

However, precision roll coating appears to be less than ideal, since a t best there is a compromise between face, fill and uniformity as in-fluenced by the tracking pattern.

It provides information on both new construction and small-scale repair and covers choice of application method, materials and mixes, specification, pumping and <b>spraying,</b> <b>finishing,</b> curing, testing and performance. The information is a combination of existing good practice and new knowledge acquired during a recently-completed three-year research project conducted at Loughborough University entitled ‘Wet Process Sprayed Concrete for Repair’. This was funded by both the UK Government (the EPSRC) and industry, namely Balvac Whitley Moran, Fibre Technology, Fosroc International, Gunform International Ltd and Putzmeister UK Ltd. This document concentrates on wet-process mortars and small aggregate concretes (< 8 mm) applied in thin layers (< 100 mm) at low/medium output rates (< 5 m 3 /hr), in some cases with mesh or fibre reinforcement.

40|$|The {{lubrication}} of dry viscose fibres by a two component finish, and the lubrication of wet Iyocell fabric against metal, {{with various}} aqueous lubricant systems, has been studied. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) was investigated {{as a means}} of providing direct chemical information from finished fibre surfaces. The composition and distribution of a two component finish applied to viscose fibres was determined successfully. When applying finish from a bath, the surface composition of the finished fibres was not controlled by the bath conditions. Increasing the concentration of finish in the bath did, however, increase the total amount of finish deposited, and increasing the concentration of antistat relative to lubricant in the bath increased the amount of antistat relative to lubricant deposited on the finished fibres. Fibre friction was determined using the capstan method. The friction forces, measured for finished viscose fibres, were correlated with the finish application conditions. Increasing the emulsion concentration in the finish bath reduced fibre/metal friction, but finish component ratio, emulsion concentration, dip time and bath temperature did not affect fibre/fibre friction. <b>Spray</b> applying the <b>finish</b> resulted in unfinished regions on the fibre surfaces and the electrical resistance of fibre bundles was not reduced.

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} (IC) {{engines are}} broadly utilized today. The friction caused by piston rings in IC engines contributes around 20 % {{of the mechanical}} friction losses. The liner finish is the most critical parameter to define the tension and other design parameters of the piston rings for proper sealing. This work is focused on developing numerical approaches to generating liner finishes based on certain values of topology parameters. The generated surface is able to simulate the lubrication and dry contact behaviors of the original surface, so that the method is used to {{study the effects of}} various topology parameters on friction losses. First, methods to analyze, generate, test, and compare honed liner surfaces have been developed. The algorithm to analyze the topology parameters of honed surfaces is described. The honed surfaces are numerically generated and compared with the experimental data. Moreover, the topological variables are changed and the corresponding friction behaviors are studied. The relations between topology variables and friction losses are illustrated. We also developed a quantitative relation between two ISO standards describing the honed liner finish, so that the manufacturing industry can use the surface generation method in convenience. Second, attempts were made to simulate the break-in processes for honed liner finish. Measured and numerically generated surfaces are simulated and compared. The friction and pressure behaviors for lightly and heavily worn surfaces are compared with experimental data. Moreover, by tuning the worn parameters, the friction effective mean pressure (FMEP) curve can match the experimental data. Finally, the algorithm to numerically generate thermally <b>sprayed</b> liner <b>finish</b> is described. The hydrodynamic and dry contact friction behaviors for generated surfaces are compared with experimental data. Critical topology parameters are tuned and their effects on friction losses are studied.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. November 2008. Major: Food science. Advisor: Dr. Gary A. Reineccius. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 102 pages. The {{objective of this}} research was to understand the effects of octenyl succinic anhydride (OSAn) substitution level of carbohydrate encapsulation materials on the capsule characteristics and real-time release of l-menthol from spray dried powder. Spray dried l-menthol powder was prepared from modified dextrin and gum acacia of varying levels of OSAn substitution. Physical properties of the microcapsules and encapsulation matrices were determined by: constructing moisture sorption isotherms, particle sizing, density measurement via pycnometry, and by total and surface menthol content of the finished powders. Real-time menthol release and moisture uptake profiles were accomplished by using dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) coupled with either Tenax trapping and gas chromatography (GC) or proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). It was found that as OSAn substitution of carbohydrates increases, total and surface menthol appeared to increase and decrease, respectively. The particle size of the <b>finished</b> <b>spray</b> dried powder was influenced by spray dryer infeed solids concentration with higher solids leading to larger particle size. Microcapsule density {{did not appear to be}} affected by OSAn substitution or carrier type. Menthol release profiles varied greatly with carrier material used. Increased OSAn substitution (up to 3 % treatment level) of the carrier material resulted in a significantly greater, but not earlier burst of menthol release. For most samples, the characteristic burst of menthol was followed by a decrease in release which was attributed to an observed matrix collapse. Moisture uptake rates of the powders were related to corresponding menthol release rates. As OSAn substitution increased for gum acacia (Acacia seyal), a trend of increased moisture uptake rate with menthol release rate was evident. However, for the dextrins, the moisture uptake rate had no influence on the rate of menthol release. The degree of OSAn substitution did not affect moisture sorption characteristics for dextrin samples. For gum acacia, increased levels of OSAn substitution resulted in a decreased affinity for moisture in the range of 0. 3 to 0. 7 aw...|$|R
