30|$|The {{electron}} beam {{is produced in}} a photoemission <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> [19]. A GaAs cathode is coated with a monolayer of cesium and oxygen to obtain negative electron affinity (NEA) conditions. In a NEA semiconductor, the conduction band minimum is above vacuum energy. Illuminating the surface with a laser excites electrons to the conduction band and can induce electron emission by tunneling through the thin surface barrier. The <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> has been described in detail in the work by Schröter et al. [20]. To keep the surface stable, ultra-high vacuum is needed. The <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> is therefore placed in a <b>separately</b> <b>pumped</b> chamber, which can be sealed off completely from the measurement vacuum chamber by a gate valve. This so-called gun chamber was heated to 220 °C for one week to reach a base pressure below 1 × 10 − 11 mbar at room temperature afterwards. During the measurements, the two chambers are connected by an aperture 1 mm in diameter, which allows a pressure of 1 × 10 − 10 mbar to be maintained in the <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> chamber.|$|R

40|$|Improvements on {{the charge}} control {{measurements}} of the torsion pendulum, <b>electron</b> <b>gun,</b> and autocollimator system were conducted at the University of Washington {{in preparation for the}} fabrication of the final prototype of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) gravitational wave detector for NASA. One main cause of transient forces on LISA is solar charges in space that can cause unwanted torque on the test masses. Using a torsion pendulum as a geometric equivalent of the test masses, charge control measurements were conducted by producing a sinusoidal curve of the charge. The pendulum could be negatively or positively charged by an <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> or a UV LED by increments as small as a pico-coulomb. The average charging for the UV LED is 3. 5 * 10 - 14 C/s, and <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> is- 4. 4 * 10 - 14 C/s, which allows for very precise control. Photocurrent of the UV LED and <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> were measured by fabricating two new <b>electron</b> <b>guns,</b> one including an Einzel lens. Preliminary results showed that a current leakage powering the UV LED was a major source of error. To compensate for this error a battery system was built to power the UV LED separately from the <b>electron</b> <b>gun.</b> Subsequent results showed that, even with the battery improvement, no difference in current could be measured.
