But what is it that makes Triodos different from other banks? Based on ethnographic research conducted in the Netherlands, I will give insight into this question from the perspective of Triodos employees. Furthermore, I present a case study where I look at the meaning investees give to their businesses and their relationship with the bank, as experienced by organic food entrepreneurs. Additionally, I bring in broader themes that my research considers, namely that of economies and sustainability.

40|$|We {{present a}} broad agenda for {{meaningful}} banking regulation reform aiming {{the creation of}} evolutive competitive environment to maximize the effectiveness of international financial system through the introduction of fair competition process among the banks in free market capitalism. We assume that the international financial system may evolve or decline within the evolutive competitive environment depending on both the environmental regulation policies {{as well as the}} competition between the banks. We present the commonly known definition of competition and apply the conceptual collateral thinking to identify the source of competitive strengths of financial institutions in free market capitalism. We explore how the banks conduct a search for competitive strategies. We show that the root cause of crisis in finances is hidden in the very wrong regulation policies and ideas behind these policies, which failed to create the evolutive competitive environment for effective, profitable, responsible and <b>sustainable</b> <b>bank</b> operation within existing international financial system. We review a number of initiatives on meaningful banking regulation reform proposed by central bankers from the G 20 nations. We propose to introduce the Random Tax and the Quantum Tax. We argue that the introduction of the Random Tax and the Quantum Tax may compensate for the negative effects commonly associated with the existing banking regulation limitations imposed on the international financial system. We believe that the Random Tax and the Quantum Tax will improve the evolutive competitive environment and make it possible for the management teams at financial institutions to search for and to execute the winning virtuous business strategies toward the effective, profitable, responsible and sustainable banks operation.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} one of {{the major}} challenges of the future: the sustainable development of the society. Sustainability is now increasingly recognized as central to the growth of emerging market economies. For the banking sector, this represents both a demand for greater social and environmental responsibility as well as a new landscape of business opportunity. Several years ago, {{the main part of the}} banks did not consider the social and environmental problems relevant for their operations. Recently, the banks began to realize the major impact of the sustainable development over the way of ulterior development of the society and, implicitly over the way of creating of the banking value in the future. In this context, the development of a banking management system, based on sustainable principles represents {{one of the}} provocations of these days. Starting from literature in the <b>sustainable</b> <b>banking</b> management field in this paper are presented several relevant issues related to risk management in the context of <b>sustainable</b> <b>banking</b> financing: the need to implement the sustainable management principles in financial and banking industry; the role of <b>banks</b> in <b>sustainable</b> development of society; social and environmental risk management policies, events that have shaped the role of the <b>banking</b> sector in <b>sustainable</b> development; international standards regarding <b>sustainable</b> <b>banking</b> management such us: Equator Principles for sustainable investment projectsâ€™ financing or GRI principles for sustainable reporting.

40|$|Brazil, Russia, India, and china'(BRIC) have {{attracted}} recent investors {{have attracted}} attention. In particular, Russia offers foreign banks material commercial opportunities. Leading {{up to the}} 2008 global crisis various relevant banking sector performance indicators suggested that banks could earn relatively high financial returns in Russia. However, this was set against backdrop of high levels of corruption, a banking sector dominated by big state-owned banks, and a national economy almost exclusively reliant on high oil and gas prices for growth. Given the context, this exploratory six bank multi-case study set out to explore underlying motivations for bank FDI into Russia, the way that such entries are and should be ideally effected, and to discover what may be effective strategies in practice to generate the expected returns, given the initial motivations. Making use of the general analytic procedure, semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} senior bank executives and independents experts, and internal bank and published documents were used to collect and analyse the data. The empirical work delivered findings at two levels. First order findings reflecting what the sample banks did successfully or needed to change in the unfolding economic context in which they found themselves; and, also very importantly, recommendations for managerial action by the sample banks going forward or other banks considering FDI in Russian banking industry. The first levels of findings are as follows. Firm specific competitive advantages {{in the form of the}} IT platform, existing relationships with MNC clients, organization learning capacity, flexibility and bank size are required. Important host country factors, namely, formal institutions rules, the socio-economic environment, political risk, bank industry saturation in home markets influenced entry decisions. A gradual entry into Russia allowed for sustainable FDI in Russia. The second level of findings, the managerial recommendations, alluded to, in turn were found to compromise two separate and distinct categories. The first category compromise the external factors to be considered when evaluating FDI in Russia, namely, the dramatic change in socio-economic environment presents both opportunities and threats; increased bi-lateral trade flows with important trading partners has increased the need for banking services; external shocks and oil and gas price volatility have rendered the Russian government more reliant on international capital markets; informal constraints (customs, norms, culture) tend to entrench the use of corrupt business practices; Russian banking industry is governed by an operational autonomous Central Bank and international acceptable laws are in place; current levels of political risk do not necessarily impact on foreign banks and are not deemed to be deterrent to investments decisions. The second category comprises of the key actions which foreign banks should take for successful FDI in Russia, namely, investment in Russia should promote attainment of overall strategic objectives of the parent; initial-entry strategy should aim to leverage the constituent parts of the global banking model; the appropriate banking structure should be utilized to garner profits for deployments in segments; the banking structure should be flexible enough to be profitable regardless of the market share; a gradual entry mode commencing with representative office should be used to manage risk and allowed for knowledge to be accumulated; the development of local Russian management should be prioritized; and progress towards the achievement of goals should be measured through financial and non-financial parameters. The direct findings leading to these important managerial recommendations display a contribution to knowledge especially given the paucity of research in the subject area. Furthermore, emanating from the first level of findings another important contribution was displayed by developing an analytical frame work in which the critical variables and their logical relationships are used to analyze and explain <b>sustainable</b> <b>bank</b> FDI in Russia. This provides guidance for future research in the immediate subject area or indeed allied services in other emerging markets...|$|E

40|$|Risk {{management}} is a pivotal factor for managing financial institutions.

The results demonstrate that banks in East Asian countries are exposed {{to a variety of}} risk exposures. Also, the findings show that banks with lower unsystematic risks do not necessarily have lower insolvency risks, indicating that the sources of insolvency risk are complicated and need further research.

Sustainability ensures that economic growth takes into consideration social and environmental issues. In the financial sector, sustainability is necessary due to the critical role played by the sector in national development. In Kenya, financial institutions are financing investments in the agricultural, manufacturing, housing, infrastructural, energy and extractive industries. These investments have significant environmental and social impacts creating the need for adoption of sustainable finance. In spite of this, initiatives aimed at sustainability in the sector, are diverse and uncoordinated, and are therefore not likely to result in tangible long term benefits for society, environment and the business community. A synergistic approach to sustainability in the industry is thus imperative. The paper proposes the adoption of a hybrid approach in implementing <b>sustainable</b> <b>banking</b> in Kenya. The model would harness the positive attributes of market-driven and compliance approaches to regulation.
