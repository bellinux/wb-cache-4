It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and I had forgotten what it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for her, and I think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E

"Then," [...] said Mister Woodchuck, [...] "there {{are some}} things that we know that you don't; and {{although}} a woodchuck might not be of much account in one of your schoolrooms, you must forgive me for <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you'd make a mighty poor woodchuck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonderful!" [...] Sarah {{acknowledged}} with emphasis. [...] "He {{has developed}} gifts of which I {{had not the}} slightest apprehension. Of course, Josephine would scratch me if I ventured upon {{such a thing as}} comparison,-so I'll be content with <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we are both very happy women." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lieutenant ONeill: Captain Bridger is not {{a hostile}} target. He was our {{commander}} and our friend and Id like to go on record as <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this action is a mistake.Captain Hudson: Lieutenant, Nathan Bridger became a hostile target the moment he disabled this ship. Now, {{get back to your}} station! ...|$|R

5000|$|... "My book wasn't made to bash {{religion}}. I {{poke fun}} at it, sure, but <b>that's</b> because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> religion is great source material for comedy, especially with the cultural dogmas each generation adds to it." [...] "...I am not <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> religion {{is a waste of}} time, as many people seem to <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> there's a lot to laugh at." ...|$|R

60|$|It seems {{useless to}} inquire. I cannot even {{decide whether the}} figure was a man's or a woman's. I can only <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was a woman's.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} for that. I {{was going to}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you need not take any further trouble with the fire. It will light of itself now." ...|$|E

Watson told Katrina Fox [...] "I've never {{made a point of}} letting people know about my sexuality because I've never thought it was relevant, but it's who I am and I'm not ashamed of it. However in <b>saying</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> in this particular day it's a lot easier to be identified as a not-so-straight woman particularly with the The L Word series out where it's glamorised if you like; it's almost a bit of a fad like we're in fashion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] breathed Miss Willett. [...] "I mean—I {{was only}} going to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> the {{slightest}} detail would have escaped me. All she seems {{to remember is that}} it took place in a church." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{may well}} <b>say,</b> now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it over, <b>that</b> {{it was this}} {{particular}} hen that started the mutiny. The men, well-driven by Mr. Pike, were ripe for an explosion, and Possum and the hen laid the train.|$|R

6000|$|... "No;--certainly not. Why {{should you}} ask all this? Do you love me? Come, Isabel; <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you love me. Will {{you call me}} vain if <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> almost <b>think</b> you do? You cannot doubt about my love;--not now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Miss Chatterton will neither sing at your concert, nor {{distribute}} {{any more}} coal tickets to encourage professional loafers!" [...] he said. [...] "In fact she is seriously ill. If {{you had not}} been enjoying yourself in Edinburgh you would have known it. You are sorry! Well, I really cannot help <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you ought to be. Miss Chatterton has not been strong all winter, and was warned against damp and exposure; but you managed to convince her it was her duty to wander {{up and down the}} village, pestering the sick folk, in spite of the rain and snow. Women have not the sense to discriminate between what is necessary and sentimental foolishness, you know." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wimsatt replied: [...] "I do, of course. Your question, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> was {{prompted}} by that very fine essay of Father Ong's, 'The Jinnee in the Well-Wrought Urn,' which you read in his book The Barbarian Within 15-25. It first appeared in Essays in Criticism at Oxford some years ago 1954, and was in part, I believe, an answer to an essay written many years ago, about twenty at least, by a friend of mine, Monroe Beardsley, and myself, called 'The Intentional Fallacy.' I would like to pay Father Ong the compliment of <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> his essay 'The Jinnee in the Well-Wrought Urn' is the only sensible response that has ever been written to that essay of ours." ...|$|R
