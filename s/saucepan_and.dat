2500|$|In 1982 Springfield met an American actress Teda Bracci at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting; {{the pair}} moved in {{together}} in April 1983, and seven months later, they exchanged vows {{at a wedding}} ceremony which was not legally recognised under California law. The pair had a [...] "tempestuous" [...] relationship which led to an altercation with both Springfield and Bracci hospitalised; Springfield had been smashed in the mouth by Bracci wielding a <b>saucepan</b> <b>and</b> had teeth knocked out, requiring plastic surgery. The pair had separated within two years.|$|E

60|$|Her {{face was}} {{absolutely}} expressionless. She was busying herself {{now with a}} small <b>saucepan,</b> <b>and</b> her back was turned towards him.|$|E
50|$|While in Australia, Miller also {{appeared}} in ads for non-stick <b>saucepans</b> <b>and</b> Ampol petroleum, which included demonstrations of real principles of physics, albeit briefly.|$|R
6000|$|... "She’s thrown all the <b>saucepans</b> <b>and</b> things overboard," [...] {{said the}} cook with desperate calmness. [...] "This lid of a tea kettle is all that’s left {{for me to}} do the cooking in." ...|$|R
60|$|Jane {{had begun}} to call Northwold home; and, {{in spite of her}} mournings over the old place, Clara thought she had never been so happy there as in her present {{dominion}} over Master Oliver, and her prospects of her <b>saucepans</b> <b>and</b> verbenas at No. 5.|$|R
60|$|With the {{dazzling}} thoughts which flashed through the cook's brain the cabbage dropped violently into the <b>saucepan,</b> <b>and</b> {{a shower of}} cooling drops fell on both men.|$|E
60|$|She had {{put down}} her <b>saucepan,</b> <b>and</b> was {{stirring}} the sugar into the beer. He dropped his two hands heavily on the table, and thrust his face forwards at her.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Fulton {{kept his}} word. When Miss Blowser returned, with her <b>saucepan</b> <b>and</b> Rangoon, {{she found her}} trunks in the passage, corded by Mr. Fulton's own {{trembling}} hands, and she departed for ever.|$|E
60|$|In next to no time 'arf-a-dozen rakes was at work, and {{the things}} they brought out o' that pond you wouldn't believe. The edge of it was all {{littered}} with rusty tin pails <b>and</b> <b>saucepans</b> <b>and</b> such-like, and by-and-by Lewis found the things he'd 'ad to go 'ome without a few hours afore, but they didn't seem to find that sack, and Bob Pretty, wot was talking to 'is wife, began to look 'opeful.|$|R

Some utensils are considered both cookware and bakeware.|$|R
5000|$|Charlie Brown gives Lucy a Valentine's Day {{card and}} mistakenly says [...] "This {{is for you}} Lucy, Merry Christmas!" [...] Charlie Brown sees Marcie and thinks that {{she is going to}} give him a Valentine's Day card but she does not. Lucy comes up to Schroeder again <b>and</b> talks about <b>saucepans,</b> <b>and,</b> again, Schroeder cannot stand it.|$|R
6000|$|... “I inclose to you [‘Dear Prue’] {{a receipt}} for the <b>saucepan</b> <b>and</b> [...] spoon, {{and a note}} of 23l. of Lewis’s, which will make up the [...] 50l. I promised for your ensuing occasion.|$|E
6000|$|... "She says," [...] added Mrs. Tolbridge, [...] "that if {{you give}} her a gridiron, a <b>saucepan,</b> <b>and</b> a fire, she will cook a meal fit for a duke. With brains, she says, one can make up all deficiencies." ...|$|E
60|$|Not more {{grateful}} for the coin than the kindness, the cripple's face glowed like a polished copper <b>saucepan,</b> <b>and</b> shuffling a pace nigher, with one upstretched hand he received the alms, while, as unconsciously, his one advanced leather stump covered the card.|$|E
50|$|Interviewed in 1975, she {{provided}} Italian and 'Chinese style' {{recipes for}} readers and included in her advice for 'young people setting up {{home for the}} first time' was that they should 'buy a couple of really good <b>saucepans</b> <b>and,</b> if possible, invest in an iron oven casserole... they last a lifetime and these days are so attractive that they can be taken to the table'.|$|R
6000|$|... "Providence," [...] was Robina's suggestion: {{it seemed}} to be the only one possible. [...] "They lifted off one of the <b>saucepans</b> <b>and</b> just dropped the thing in--fortunately wrapped up in a brown paper parcel, which gave them both time {{to get out of the}} house. At least Veronica got clear off. For a change it was not she who fell over the mat, it was the boy." ...|$|R
50|$|This is {{the land}} Jack's beanstalk led to. The children, <b>Saucepan,</b> Silky <b>and</b> Moonface go through here to rescue Connie.|$|R
60|$|On {{the chest}} of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small {{saucepan}} on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the <b>saucepan,</b> <b>and</b> an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood near it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'To see how dreadful {{she takes}} on, going moping about, and taking no {{pleasure}} in nothing, except when her friends comes in, out of charity, {{to sit with}} her, and make her comfortable,' resumed Mrs. Cluppins, glancing at the tin <b>saucepan</b> <b>and</b> the Dutch oven, 'it's shocking!' ...|$|E
60|$|As it {{was plain}} that Sampson was bent on a {{complimentary}} harangue, unless {{he received a}} timely interruption, Mr Quilp politely tapped him on the crown of his head with the little <b>saucepan,</b> <b>and</b> requested {{that he would be}} so obliging as to hold his peace.|$|E
50|$|Igor is a 1-trillion-millenniums-old Transylvanian man who {{has very}} poor hygiene (but claims it's an old Transylvanian custom). He also works at the café and loves making potions and other weird concoctions. He also has a pet dustbin called Vinny. Igor also has a short temper, when he gets angry he has a 'Monster Bubbly' where he {{breathes}} fire <b>and</b> throws <b>saucepans</b> <b>and</b> custard pies (which always hit Skull) at other monsters.|$|R
6000|$|Morgan {{resumed his}} imperturbable demeanour. [...] "Know nothing about it, sir. Servants don't know them {{kind of things}} the least. Most probbly {{there was nothing in}} it--so many lies is told about families--Marobblan went away, bag <b>and</b> baggage, <b>saucepans,</b> <b>and</b> pianna, and all--the feller ad a pianna, and wrote potry in French, and he took a lodging at Clavering, and he hankered about the primises, and it was said that Madam Fribsy, the milliner, brought letters to Miss Hamory, though I don't believe a word about it; nor that he tried to pison hisself with charcoal, which it was all a humbug betwigst him and Madam Fribsy; and he was nearly shot by the keeper in the park." ...|$|R
50|$|His predecessor, Captain Maconochie, {{had been}} {{of a more}} kindly disposition. He had looked on his prisoners as human beings and had given them some little {{interest}} in life {{by allowing them to}} have small farm plots in which they could grow sweet potatoes and other vegetables. Maconochie also shortened hours of labor, holidays were granted to those convicts whose behaviour was considered satisfactory, and each prisoner was allowed to cook his own meals in <b>saucepans</b> <b>and</b> kettles specially provided.|$|R
60|$|Hans {{showed us}} {{everything}} that had happened; where the chair in which Inez was carried was set down, where she and Janee {{had been allowed to}} walk that she might stretch her stiff limbs, the dregs of some coffee that evidently Janee had made in a <b>saucepan,</b> <b>and</b> so forth.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Let 's cook 'em, {{then they}} 'll be good, {{and we can}} put some away in our little pails for to-morrow.'" [...] 'That will be splendid! There 's {{a fire in the}} kitchen, Debby always leaves the kettle on, and we can use her <b>saucepan,</b> <b>and</b> I know where the sugar is, and we 'll have a grand time.' [...] "In we went, and fell to work very quietly. It was a large, open fire-place, with the coals nicely covered up, and the big kettle {{simmering}} on the hook. We raked open the fire, put on the <b>saucepan,</b> <b>and</b> in it the best of our plums, with water enough to spoil them. But we did n't know that, and felt very important as we sat waiting for it to boil, each armed with a big spoon, while the sugar box stood between us ready to be used.|$|E
6000|$|... "How nice it is!" [...] exclaimed Maud, as {{she emerged}} from the big closet where Polly kept her stores. [...] "Such a cunning teakettle and <b>saucepan,</b> <b>and</b> a tete-a-tete set, and lots of good things to eat. Do have toast for tea, Polly, and let me make it with the new {{toasting}} fork; it 's such fun to play cook." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Casual line {{came with}} {{matching}} cookware such as Dutch ovens, covered skillets, <b>saucepans</b> <b>and</b> fry pans that were oven proof and complemented the tableware. Iroquois also provided asbestos pads to protect countertops and tabletops while using the ware which were back stamped with the verbiage; [...] "for best results use an asbestos pad." [...] Additionally, various serving pieces were produced {{to match the}} dinnerware such as vegetable bowls, [...] "Lazy Susan" [...] side dishes, and gravy boats and under plates.|$|R
50|$|At {{the rise}} of the curtain, Gianna the cook and her scullery maids are busy {{preparing}} dinner, but Gianna no sooner leaves the kitchen than the scullery maids abandon their duties and begin to dance <b>and</b> play with <b>saucepans</b> <b>and</b> skillets.Gianna returns, sees their mischief and sternly orders them back to business; they pay her no heed and Gianna, drawn into their merriment, begins to dance with them. A bell is heard. Gianna now emphatically orders her helpers to calm down; in confusion, they rush back to their places.|$|R
40|$|The {{changes in}} {{composition}} and shapes in domestic wares detected among the communities along the lower Guadalquivir valley, from the 3 rdcentury B. C., seem {{to point to}} a slow but constant transformation in alimentary habits. On one side is a growing Phoenician influence, reflectedin {{the emergence of new}} cooking wares: <b>saucepans,</b> mortars <b>and</b> big bowls, related with new ways of processing and preparing food. Following a parallel evolution, the distribution of salted products, oil and other foodstuffs from the area around the Strait and the Cadiz plain becomes common. However, local cooking wares, mainly <b>saucepans</b> <b>and</b> big, straight-walled bowls, remain dominant at least until the early 1 st century B. C., suggesting a low receptivity for changes in cooking practices. The Roman conquest introduced Italian fine wares, without apparently affecting consumption patterns among local populations. In addition,from the 2 nd century B. C. and over the following century, the importation and imitation of Italian cooking wares became generalised in indigenous contexts...|$|R
60|$|The captain {{followed}} this {{up with a}} roar and such an indescribably ferocious demonstration that the girl fled in terror to the culinary regions, where she found the cat breakfasting on a pat of butter. The girl yelled, and flung first a <b>saucepan,</b> <b>and</b> after that the lid of a teapot, at the thief. She failed, of course, in this effort to commit murder, and the cat vanished.|$|E
60|$|For {{though the}} fire was warm in front, behind was very cold. Pancrazio stuck a long pointed stick down the handle of a <b>saucepan,</b> <b>and</b> gave this utensil to Ciccio, to hold over the fire and scald the milk, whilst he put the tin coffee-pot in the ashes. He took a long iron tube or blow-pipe, which rested on two little feet at the far end. This he gave to Giovanni to blow the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Talk! She'll think I'm threatenin' {{to knock}} her head off, or somethin'. There there, don't ee cry! We'll go see papa soon.--Confound it, man, I can't {{go on with}} this thing! There, there! See, child, we're goin' to have some nice hot pancakes now; goin' to have breakfast now. See, ol' pap's goin' to fry some pancakes. Whoop--see!" [...] He took down the <b>saucepan,</b> <b>and</b> flourished {{it in order to}} make his meaning plainer. Bert laughed.|$|E
40|$|The {{excavations}} at the Beira Rio Guest House {{have brought}} remains of Mértola’s riverside settlement to light, a well organized 12 th century neighbourhood. The houses {{do not differ}} from others in Mértola coming from the same period, but the remains and objects found within them allow this area to be inserted within the riverside context. The ceramics found include new items relative to the repertoire of the Umayyad era (<b>saucepans</b> <b>and</b> casseroles with a marked body, casseroles with rudimentary “ribs” and bottles and small vases made from white clay) {{and a set of}} imported ceramics (“cuerda seca” and “esgrafiada”) ...|$|R
50|$|The song {{catalogues}} {{the troubles}} of a harassed housewife. The song {{is associated with the}} rugby union club Llanelli RFC and, more recently, the Scarlets regional rugby side. The association derives from Llanelli's tin plating industry, which used to tin-plate steel <b>saucepans</b> <b>and</b> other kitchen utensils as a cheap supply to the British public. During the final years of Stradey Park, the former ground of Llanelli RFC and the Scarlets, the goalposts were adorned with Scarlet saucepans as a tribute to the town's history; the utensils have been transferred to the clubs' new ground, Parc y Scarlets. The Scarlets' official magazine is titled Sosban.|$|R
5000|$|The Saucepan Man, {{who lives}} with Mr. Watzisname. His name {{stems from the fact}} that he is covered all over with <b>saucepans</b> <b>and</b> kettles. Sometimes, he cannot {{understand}} what his friends are saying because he is partially deaf, which is further aggravated by all the noise from the pans and kettles which he carries all the time. In the cartoon series he looks very similar to Horace and Jasper from 1961 Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians. The Saucepan Man also appears in another lesser-known Blyton book, The Book of Brownies (aka Brownie Tales), helping the travellers out of one of their many bouts of trouble on their journey.|$|R
