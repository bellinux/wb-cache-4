5|$|Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, grapefruit, fluoxetine, erythromycin, diltiazem, {{clarithromycin}} {{inhibit the}} metabolism of midazolam, {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, <b>sedative</b> antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the <b>sedative</b> effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} dental {{prescriptions for}} anxiolytics, <b>sedatives,</b> and hypnotics for Brazilian outpatients in 2010. Methods. A cross-sectional {{study was conducted}} using data {{on the use of}} anxiolytics, <b>sedatives,</b> and hypnotics from the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency, Brazil, 2010. For each prescription, prescribed drugs and the prescribed amount were identified. Prescribed medications were classified according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code. We calculated the number of Defined Daily Doses (DDD) for anxiolytics, <b>sedatives,</b> and hypnotics by code, their mean DDD, and DDD per inhabitant per year. Results. There were 16, 436 prescriptions dispensed, including anxiolytics, <b>sedatives,</b> and hypnotics. These prescriptions corresponded to 3, 555, 780. 50 [*]mg, distributed as 2, 286, 200. 50 [*]mg (64. 30 %) of anxiolytics and 1, 269, 580. 00 [*]mg (35. 70 %) of <b>sedatives</b> and hypnotics. This amount allowed treating approximately 474, 106 individuals (number of DDD). The anxiolytics most frequently dispensed were bromazepam (25. 30 %), alprazolam (19. 19 %), and diazepam (15. 60 %). <b>Sedatives</b> and hypnotics mostly prescribed were zolpidem (9. 55 %), midazolam (6. 99 %), and flunitrazepam (2. 14 %). The per capita rates (100, 000 inhabitants) of anxiolytics and sedatives/hypnotics were 6. 83 and 1. 78, respectively. Conclusions. Benzodiazepines and derivatives were the most frequently prescribed drugs. There was a low rate of dental prescriptions for anxiolytics, <b>sedatives,</b> and hypnotics, although excessive doses were concentrated in the same prescription...|$|R
30|$|In all {{patients}} treated with <b>sedatives,</b> sedation was managed and titrated {{by using the}} Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS). In {{all patients}} treated with <b>sedatives,</b> daily interruption of sedation was an integral component of the sedation protocol. To establish sedation, short active <b>sedatives</b> such as disoprivan were preferred providing absence of hemodynamic instability. In patients with hemodynamic instability, sedation was achieved by administration of benzodiazepines given at the lowest possible dose and titrated according to the sedation level as determined by SAS.|$|R
5|$|Although {{antidepressants}} with anxiolytic properties {{have been}} introduced, {{and there is}} increasing awareness of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, prescriptions for short-term anxiety relief have not significantly dropped. For treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines are now less popular than nonbenzodiazepines, which include zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct, but nonetheless, they work on the same benzodiazepine receptors and produce similar <b>sedative</b> effects.|$|E
5|$|Bromine has {{sometimes}} been considered to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported by only limited circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical <b>sedative,</b> before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{is known}} to be {{additive}} to even minimal alcohol intoxication, and also to the effects of other drugs such as cannabis (which is more likely than alcohol to have effects that last into a day of abstinence from use). Other <b>sedative</b> and analgesic drugs, such as opiate narcotics and benzodiazepines, add to narcosis.|$|E
50|$|Bromide compounds, {{especially}} potassium bromide, {{were frequently}} used as <b>sedatives</b> in the 19th and early 20th century. Their use in over-the-counter <b>sedatives</b> and headache remedies (such as Bromo-Seltzer) in the United States extended to 1975, when bromides were withdrawn as ingredients, due to chronic toxicity.|$|R

5|$|Some authors {{challenge}} {{the validity of}} the second step (mild opioids) and, pointing to their higher toxicity and low efficacy, argue that mild opioids could be replaced by small doses of strong opioids (with the possible exception of tramadol due to its demonstrated efficacy in cancer pain, its specificity for neuropathic pain, and its low <b>sedative</b> properties and reduced potential for respiratory depression in comparison to conventional opioids).|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, <b>sedative,</b> hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E
5|$|Bromide compounds, {{especially}} potassium bromide, {{were frequently}} used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Bromides {{in the form}} of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies from country to country. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve bromide for the treatment of any disease, and it was removed from over-the-counter <b>sedative</b> products like Bromo-Seltzer, in 1975.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{when the}} only {{anticonvulsant}} drugs were the <b>sedative</b> bromides (discovered 1857) and phenobarbital (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when H. Houston Merritt and Tracy Putnam discovered phenytoin (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of sodium valproate in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across {{a broad range of}} epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, declined further.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2002, President George W. Bush {{underwent}} a colonoscopy and chose to invoke Section 3 of the amendment, temporarily transferring his powers to Vice President Dick Cheney.

Bush woke up twenty minutes later, {{but did not}} resume his presidential powers and duties until 9:24a.m. EDT after the president's physician, Richard Tubb, conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the additional {{time to make sure}} the <b>sedative</b> had no aftereffects. Unlike Reagan's 1985 letter, Bush's 2002 letter specifically cited Section 3 as the authority for the transfer of power.|$|E

Two people, whose identities were withheld, were selected to administer individual injections, of which only one was lethal so that neither would know with certainty who executed the prisoner. The prison selected among paramedics or nurses because the American Medical Association prohibits licensed physicians from participating in executions. A mild <b>sedative</b> was delivered intravenously to calm Parsons before the deadly drugs were administered.|$|E

5|$|Peak {{benefits}} achieved for generalized {{anxiety disorder}} (GAD) may take up to a week. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and antipanic effects is controversial, with only some authoritative sources supporting the development of tolerance; tolerance will, however, develop to the <b>sedative</b> and hypnotic effects {{within a couple of}} days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition.|$|E
5|$|Shulgin began {{studying}} organic chemistry as a Harvard University scholarship {{student at the}} age of 16. In 1943 he dropped out of school to join the U.S. Navy. While serving on USS Pope in the Navy during World War II, Shulgin was given a glass of orange juice by a nurse prior to surgery for a thumb infection. Shulgin drank the juice and, assuming that the powder {{at the bottom of the}} glass was a <b>sedative,</b> fell asleep rapidly. Upon waking he learned that the powder was undissolved sugar.

5|$|The two neurotransmitters {{that are}} used most widely in the {{vertebrate}} brain are glutamate, which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is almost always inhibitory. Neurons using these transmitters {{can be found in}} nearly every part of the brain. Because of their ubiquity, drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects. Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their <b>sedative</b> effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.|$|E

5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a <b>sedative)</b> to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the high}} blood {{solubility}} of methoxyflurane is often undesirable, this property makes it useful in certain situations—it persists in the lipid compartment {{of the body}} for a long time, providing sedation and analgesia well into the postoperative period. There is substantial data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective analgesic and <b>sedative</b> agent at subanesthetic doses. Supervised self-administration of methoxyflurane in children and adults can briefly lead to deep sedation, {{and it has been}} used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures in children in hospital emergency departments. During childbirth, administration of methoxyflurane produces significantly better analgesia, less psychomotor agitation, and only slightly more somnolence than trichloroethylene.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong <b>sedative</b> actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E
