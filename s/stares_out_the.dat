She also suggests that her situation is too complicated for a young woman such as herself to realistically see through a life with Rick, a baby, and no money or viable career opportunities for either of them. Rick is upset, and hands her an engagement ring that he planned to propose with, suggesting that she could pawn it. Alice then talks to Sheryl, asking her what happened to her earlier views regarding how nothing could stop true love. Sheryl tells her that she is simply too young to understand.

A fur-clad young woman named Chika (Akemi Negishi), {{who lives in a}} remote village somewhere deep in the mountains. Chika is none too pleased to see so many visitors in the lodge, since the people of her village shun all contact with outsiders. However, the night is so brutal that she has little choice but to join them if she wants to stay warm. There is still no response from the cabin; and the little group is horrified to hear the sound of an avalanche thundering down a nearby slope. The lodge telephone starts ringing. Machiko runs to the phone; but no sooner has she put it up to her ear when she throws it back down again in horror. Through the earpiece comes the sound of screams, followed by a single gunshot. There is a moment of silence. Takashi picks up the receiver, he hears another agonized scream and the line goes dead. Chika puts her furs back on and slips away, unnoticed by the others.|$|E

5000|$|The narrator spends {{four days}} hitchhiking from Saginaw to join Kathy in Pittsburgh, where {{together}} they board a Greyhound bus {{to continue the}} journey. The narrator begins with a lighthearted and optimistic outlook ("Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together") that fades {{over the course of}} the song. To pass time, he and Kathy play games and try to guess the backgrounds of their fellow passengers. Over the course of their journey, they smoke all their cigarettes. Kathy reads a magazine before falling asleep, leaving the narrator awake to reflect on the meaning of the journey alone. In the final verse, the narrator is able to speak his true emotions to Kathy, now that she is sleeping and cannot hear or answer. [...] "I'm empty and aching and I don't know why" [...] captures the longing and angst of the 1960s in nine simple words. The narrator then <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window [...] "counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike." [...] Many other empty, aching, and lost souls are on the highway, each on their own journey alone even if someone is traveling with them. The soaring harmony lines and crashing cymbals create a powerful and poignant end to the song's final verse: [...] "They've all come to look for America." [...] Pete Fornatale interprets this lyric as a [...] "metaphor to remind us all of the lost souls wandering the highways and byways of mid-sixties America, struggling to navigate the rapids of despair and hope, optimism and disillusionment." ...|$|E

50|$|Walt {{meets with}} Jack {{and his men}} at their hideout, where Jesse is still {{performing}} slave labor for the gang in an adjacent Quonset hut. Jack refuses Walt's offer and orders him killed. Walt diverts Jack's attention by accusing him of partnering with Jesse; Jack responds by ordering that Jesse join them. Upon seeing Jesse, Walt tackles him and uses his car keys to remote-fire the machine gun (which he has connected to a pivoting turret rigged to the car key's remote unlock button) from his car. Jack's men are killed in the barrage of gunfire; Jack and Walt are wounded while Todd and Jesse are unharmed. As Todd <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window in amazement at the now-empty machine gun pivoting in its turret, Jesse strangles and kills Todd with the chain attached to his handcuffs, and then frees himself by taking a key from Todd's pocket. After Walt picks up a dropped handgun, Jack pleads for his life, attempting to bargain with {{the location of the}} stolen money, but Walt coldly kills Jack. Walt gives the gun to Jesse and asks Jesse to kill him. Jesse notices Walt's wound and refuses, telling Walt to kill himself. As Jesse and Walt leave Jack's house, Walt answers a call on Todd's phone from a visibly ill Lydia. He informs her that her business partners are dead and asks if she's feeling a little under the weather, revealing that he had earlier put ricin in her stevia at the coffee shop. Jesse and Walt exchange a farewell glance before Jesse leaves. Jesse flees in Todd's El Camino, crying with joy.|$|E
5000|$|Several months pass, and Hester {{has begun}} to enter labor as David, J.B., Shory, and Gus wait downstairs {{for the child to}} be born. Beeves tries to {{convince}} Gus to take over sixty percent of his business ventures so he can raise enough money to purchase more mink. Gus refuses on the basis that David could lose everything he owns if his mink perish, to which he replies that he has already mortgaged most of his assets. As things escalate into quarrel, David divulges that Hester has fallen and that {{it is possible that the}} child could be delivered as a stillbirth or deformed. David is convinced that this catastrophe is his final payment for all of the luck that has pursued him throughout his recent life. Ironically, the child is born a healthy boy, and David continues to feel ashamed and guilty about his prosperity. A month later, Gus and Hester learn that Dan Dibble’s mink have all died after consuming contaminated feed - David uses the same feed for his own mink. Both decide to hold off on telling him; Gus fearing that his psychological and emotional stability might come into jeopardy, and Hester believing that such a loss would eventually make him happy in the long run. Dibble eventually calls the house and informs David, who begins to chastise Hester. She makes the decision to leave him, the reasoning behind this misconstrued by David as Gus having an affair with his wife. Just as things come to an emotional climax, Dibble arrives and assuages their fears - he and David both realize that the careful monitoring of the feed has saved his mink. David has an epiphany after Gus points out that only Beeves’ hard work and meticulous care giving could have saved the mink, not luck. He then departs. Hester asks David to come up for bed, and as thunder roars in the distance, he <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window with apprehension.|$|E

The next day, Gregory and Jesus discuss what to do about Maggie and Sasha when some Saviors show up. Gregory tells Jesus to hide Maggie and Sasha in the closet. Gregory opens the door for Simon and the other Saviors at the Hilltop. Simon tells Gregory they should talk in private in the study. Gregory said the message last night was received loud and clear: He is the Hilltop's [...] "Negan" [...] now. Simon asks if there is anything else he should be made aware of and Gregory stays silent. He says that there actually is something and Gregory leads Simon to the corridor closest, opening the door to reveal bottles of classic scotch. Simon asks Gregory to kneel before they continue and Gregory instantly obliges. Simon tells him it's a solid kneel, and pats his head like a child. After the Saviors leave, Gregory finds Sasha and Maggie in his room, where they were hiding in a closet. Jesus puts his foot down and says the women are staying, and he will knock Gregory out of power if he disagrees. Gregory says the Saviors can be quite reasonable and Maggie punches him in the face. In the mid-season finale [...] "Hearts Still Beating", Gregory warns Maggie not to let her popularity with the Hilltop residents get to her head.|$|E
