2500|$|Most of Ribbentrop's {{time was}} spent either {{demanding}} that Britain sign the Anti-Comintern Pact or that London return the former German colonies in Africa. But he also devoted considerable time to courting {{what he called the}} [...] "men of influence" [...] as the best way to achieve an Anglo-German alliance. Ribbentrop believed the British aristocracy comprised <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>secret</b> society that ruled from behind the scenes, and if he could befriend enough members of Britain's [...] "secret government", he could bring about the alliance. Almost all of the initially favourable reports Ribbentrop provided to Berlin about the alliance's prospects were based on friendly remarks about the [...] "New Germany" [...] that came from British aristocrats such as Lord Londonderry and Lord Lothian; the rather cool reception that Ribbentrop received from British Cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats did not make much of an impression on him at first. In their view, summarised by Viscount Cranborne, he always was a second rate man.|$|E

As soon as he had {{swallowed}} his breakfast, he flew up to the old orchard and hid among the white and pink apple blossoms to watch for Johnny Chuck. You see, he knew that Johnny Chuck had <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a <b>secret</b> which filled Johnny with very great pride; but what it was Sammy Jay couldn't even guess, and nothing troubles Sammy Jay quite {{so much as the}} feeling that he cannot find out the <b>secrets</b> <b>of</b> other people.

5000|$|It {{is unclear}} what relationship, if any, {{the old man}} and his murderer share. The narrator denies having any {{feelings}} of hatred or resentment for the man who had, he says, never wronged him. He also denies that he killed for greed. The specific motivation for murder, the relationship between narrator and old man, and other details are left unclear. It has been suggested that the old man is a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his [...] "vulture-eye" [...] represents <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> veiled <b>secret,</b> or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand {{in stark contrast to the}} specific plot details leading up to the murder.|$|R

60|$|When in the room, Chainbearer and I seated {{ourselves}} {{near the}} door, while Thousandacres had a {{chair on the}} turf without, surrounded by his sons, {{all of whom were}} standing. As this arrangement was made amid a grave silence, the effect was not altogether without impressiveness, and partook of some of the ordinary aspects of justice. I was struck with the anxious curiosity betrayed in the countenances of the females in particular; for the decision to which Thousandacres was about to come, would with them have the authority of a judgment of Solomon. Accustomed to reason altogether in their own interests, I make no doubt that, in the main, all of that semi-barbarous breed fancied themselves invested, in their lawless occupation, by <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>secret</b> natural right; ignorant of the fact that, the moment they reduced their claim to this standard, they put it on the level with that of all the rest of mankind. Nature gives nothing exclusively to an individual, beyond his individuality, and that which appertains to his person and personal qualities; all beyond he is compelled to share, under the law of nature, {{with the rest of his}} race. A title dependent on original possession forms no exception to this rule; for it is merely human convention that gives it force and authority, without which it would form no title at all. But into mysteries like these, none of the family of Thousandacres ever entered; though the still, small voice of conscience, the glimmerings of right, were to be traced occasionally, even amid the confused jumble of social maxims in which their selfishness had taken refuge.|$|E
60|$|I regained my compartment, which I {{was annoyed}} to find had filled up till mine {{was the only}} vacant seat. I had not had time to buy any papers or magazines, but, after all, I had enough to {{interest}} me in my thoughts. Of Tapilow I scarcely thought at all. He and I had met, and I had kept my oath. So far as I was concerned, that was the end. I had not even any fears for my own safety as regards this matter. My interview with Decresson and his friend had had a curiously convincing effect upon me. I felt that I had been tried for my crime, and acquitted, in the most orthodox fashion. For me the curtain had fallen upon that tragedy. It was the other things which occupied my mind. I seemed to have found my way into a maze, to have become mixed up in certain affairs in a most mysterious and inexplicable way. What was the meaning of that place to which Louis had introduced me? Was it <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>secret</b> organization,--an organization which assumed to itself, at any rate, the power to circumvent the police? And Bartot, too! Had he really the power which Louis had declared him to possess? If so, why had he baited a clumsy trap for me and permitted me {{to walk out of}} it untouched? What did they want from me, these people? The thought was utterly confusing. I could find absolutely no explanation. Then, again, another puzzle remained. I remembered Louis' desire, almost command, that I should return to London by this particular train. Had he any reason for it? Was it connected in any way, I wondered, with the presence of this man and girl in the next compartment? It seemed feasible, even if inexplicable.|$|E

Edie was relieved, but she {{was by no means}} satisfied. She knew Harry loved her tenderly, devotedly; but she knew also there was <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> shadow or <b>secret</b> looming ominously between them.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Traditional {{methods for}} message {{authentication}} {{are based on}} the cryptographic verification of received data using <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a shared <b>secret.</b> While this task is not critical for traditional networks, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) may pay a high price for the gained protection – sensor nodes are forced to invest their already scarce resources in receiving a message and executing cryptographic computations, only to discard the message afterwards in case of a failed authentication. This work introduces a different, crypto-free approach for enabling authenticated communication by leveraging peculiarities of wireless communication, in particular its broadcast nature and the feasibility of channel capacity jamming. Instead of receiving and then verifying transmitted data, sensor nodes are prevented from receiving fake data at all. This is achieved by coupling physical characteristics of signal propagation with legitimate transmissions. Such a coupling enables the detection and invalidation of impersonation attacks by using short jamming pulses emitted by surrounding WSN nodes. We justify this concept by designing a novel communication protocol explicitly integrating the jamming feature, and analyze factors which impact the efficiency of successful jamming, such as the frame length, transmission timing accuracy, and various other issues identified through extensive empirical measurements.

60|$|This {{proposal}} was thought by themselves liberal indeed; and they expected the highest applauses for it. However, their reception {{was very different}} from their expectations. When they brought up their plan to the House of Commons, the offer, as it was natural, of 400,000l. was very well relished. But nothing could be more disgustful than the 80,000l. which the Company had divided amongst themselves. A violent tempest of public indignation and fury rose against them. The heads of people turned. The Company was held well able to pay 400,000l. a year to government; but bankrupts, if they attempted to divide the fifth part of it among themselves. An ex post facto law was brought in with great precipitation, for annulling this dividend. In the bill was inserted a clause, which suspended for about a year the right, which, under the public faith, the Company enjoyed, of making their own dividends. Such was the disposition and temper of the House, that although the plain face of facts, reason, arithmetic, all the authority, parts, and eloquence in the kingdom, were against this bill; though all the Chancellors of the Exchequer, who had held that office from the beginning of this reign, opposed it; yet a few placemen of the subordinate departments sprung out of their ranks, took the lead, and, by an opinion of <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>secret</b> support, carried the bill with a high hand, leaving the then Secretary of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a very moderate minority. In this distracted situation, the managers of the bill, notwithstanding their triumph, did not venture to propose the payment of the civil list debt. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was not in good humor enough, after his late defeat by his own troops, to co-operate in such a design; so they made an act, to lock up the money in the exchequer until they should have time to look about them, and settle among themselves what they were to do with it.|$|E

5000|$|Fortune telling fraud, {{also called}} the bujo or egg curse scam, {{is a type of}} {{confidence}} trick, based on a claim of secret or occult information.

The archetypical grifter working the scam is a fortune teller who announces that the mark is suffering from a curse that her magic can relieve, while threatening dire consequences if the curse is not lifted.|$|E

[...] On the other hand, stars of David, pentagrams, (left-facing) swastikas, triskelions, and other non-Christian symbols are found in many of Maciachini's facades and architectures.

The plot gradually develops when Colin receives three mysterious messages in quick succession containing cryptic references to [...] "the Thirteen" [...] and to Lewis Carrolls The Hunting of the Snark. He quickly connects this to Balzac and begins a quixotic quest to uncover what the messages mean and who the Thirteen are.
