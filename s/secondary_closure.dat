40|$|Background: Gastroschisis patients’ {{morbidity}} {{is still}} high, underlining {{the importance of}} identifying factors associated with adverse outcomes. Objective: To determine factors influencing gastroschisis patients’ morbimortality during the first 3 years of life in “Centro Hospitalar São João” (CHSJ). Methodology: Records of infants born with gastroschisis between January 2002 and December 2011 admitted to CHSJ were reviewed. The relation between demographic and clinical data and morbimortality during the first 3 years of life, specifically anthropometric evolution and digestive outcome, was evaluated. The factors that were compared were simple versus complex gastroschisis and primary versus <b>secondary</b> <b>closure.</b> Results: Forty records were analysed. The survival rate was 92. 3 %. Patients with complex gastroschisis had worse outcomes: hospital stay (median 59 versus 23. 5 days), total parenteral nutrition (50 versus 19 days), total oral intake reached (47 versus 22. 5 days), morphine analgesia (9 versus 3 days), intestinal occlusion (60 % versus 11. 8 %), perforation (60 % versus 0 %) and ischaemia (40 % versus 0 %), sepsis (100 % versus 32. 4 %), short bowel syndrome (40 % versus 3. 1 %), laxative need during 1 -year follow-up (40 % versus 0 %), weight percentile < 5 at 6 months (75 % versus 13. 6 %) and gastrointestinal symptoms {{after the first year}} of life (OR: 42; 95 % CI: 2. 01 - 877. 5). <b>Secondary</b> <b>closure</b> patients had worse outcomes: start of oral intake (25 versus 11. 5 days), total oral intake reached (48 versus 23 days), necrotizing enterocolitis (40 % versus 2. 9 %) and mortality (40 % versus 2. 9 %). Conclusion: Complex gastroschisis and <b>secondary</b> <b>closure</b> were both associated with higher morbidity. <b>Secondary</b> <b>closure</b> was also associated with higher mortality. Complex gastroschisis revealed to be a predictive factor for higher incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms after the first year of life.

The aim of the present prospective study was to analyze the early and late results of <b>secondary</b> <b>closure</b> of giant omphaloceles using the component separation technique (CST) in infants. METHODS: From January 2004 to January 2007, 10 consecutive pediatric patients with a giant omphalocele were treated at our department. Initially, patients were treated conservatively. After epithelialization of the omphalocele, the abdominal wall was reconstructed using CST. Patients were monitored for complications during admission, and all patients were seen for follow-up. RESULTS: Component separation technique was performed at median age of 6. 5 months (range, 5 - 69 months). The median diameter of the hernia was 8 cm (range, 6 - 9 cm). There was no mortality. The postoperative course was uneventful in 7 patients. Complications were seen in 3 patients (infection, skin necrosis, and hematoma). Median hospital stay was 7 days.

40|$|AIM—To {{evaluate}} histomorphometrically {{the optic}} nerve head in highly myopic eyes with absolute <b>secondary</b> angle <b>closure</b> glaucoma.  METHODS—Optic disc sections of 16  highly myopic eyes with an axial length {{of more than}} 26  mm and of 19  eyes with an axial length of less than 26  mm were histomorphometrically evaluated. All eyes had been enucleated due to painful absolute <b>secondary</b> angle <b>closure</b> glaucoma.  RESULTS—In the highly myopic eyes compared with the non-highly myopic eyes, mean optic disc diameter was significantly larger (mean 2. 33  (SD 0. 55) mm versus 1. 77  (0. 50) mm; p= 0. 01), and the optic cup was significantly shallower (optic cup depth 0. 34  (0. 29) mm versus 0. 63  (0. 23) mm; p= 0. 03). The peripapillary scleral ring was significantly broader (0. 58  (0. 65) mm versus 0. 08  (0. 06) mm; p= 0. 001), and the β zone (0. 83  (0. 74) mm versus 0. 28  (0. 25) mm; p= 0. 006) of the parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy was significantly larger in the highly myopic eyes.  CONCLUSIONS—The {{results of the present}} study agree with biomorphometric data of the optic nerve head in highly myopic eyes with glaucoma.

40|$|BACKGROUND There is {{evidence}} of certain beneficial effects and increasing understanding of the mechanisms of action of negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT). However, {{it is known that}} prolonged duration of NPWT is associated with increased bacterial growth and efforts should be made to decrease the duration of NPWT. It was the aim of this study to evaluate potential risk factors for the duration, from first application of NPWT to <b>secondary</b> wound <b>closure</b> and to identify factors that increase the rate of hospital readmission. METHODS In a retrospective cohort study, 261 patients (46 ± 19 years, 70 female) who underwent 280 treatments with NPWT were analysed. Patient-specific and demographic characteristics and the presence of several risk factors were documented. The duration of treatment from first application of NPWT to <b>secondary</b> wound <b>closure,</b> the number of interventions, the duration of hospital stay and the incidence of readmissions due to complications of the wound treated by NPWT were recorded and a risk factor analysis was performed. RESULTS The median number of NPWT procedures was 2. 0 ± 2. 0, the duration of NPWT was 6. 0 ± 14. 7 days and the length of hospital stay was 16. 0 ± 27. 9 days. Presence of an open fracture (p =. 002) and increased age (p =. 004) were identified as independent risk factors for a prolonged duration of NPWT. Patients who smoked (p =. 001) or patients with alcohol/drug abuse (p =. 015) were more likely to return to hospital (smoking: 18 out of 58 cases; alcohol/drug abuse: 7 out of 19 cases). No such association was seen for diabetes (p =. 702), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (p =. 052), immunosuppressive medication (p =. 187), immunodeficiency (p =. 404), trauma (p =. 358), infection (p =. 298) and open fracture (p =. 061). CONCLUSIONS Patient age and presence of an open fracture are independent predictors of a prolonged duration from first application of NPWT to <b>secondary</b> wound <b>closure.</b> These results should be taken into account for the calculation of average costs and anticipated hospital stay associated with this therapy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Deep sternal wound {{infection}} after {{cardiac surgery}} carries high morbidity and mortality. Our strategy for deep sternal wound infection is aggressive strenal debridement followed by vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy and omental-muscle flap reconstrucion. We describe this strategy {{and examine the}} outcome and long-term quality of life (QOL) it achieves. Methods We retrospectively examined 16 patients treated for deep sternal wound infection between 2001 and 2007. The most recent nine patients were treated with total sternal resection followed by VAC therapy and <b>secondary</b> <b>closure</b> with omental-muscle flap reconstruction (recent group); whereas the former seven patients were treated with sternal preservation if possible, without VAC therapy, and four of these patients underwent primary closure (former group). We assessed long-term quality of life after DSWI by using the Short Form 36 -Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF 36 v 2). Results One patient died and four required further surgery for recurrence of deep sternal wound infection in the former group. The duration of treatment for deep sternal wound infection in the recent group was significantly shorter than that in previous group (63. 4 ± 54. 1 days vs. 120. 0 ± 31. 8 days, respectively; p = 0. 039). Despite aggressive sternal resection, the QOL of patients treated for DSWI was only minimally compromised compared with age-, sex-, surgical procedures-matched patients without deep sternal wound infection. Conclusions Aggressive sternal debridement followed by VAC therapy and <b>secondary</b> <b>closure</b> with an omental-muscle flap is effective for deep sternal wound infection. In this series, it resulted in a lower incidence of recurrent infection, shorter hospitalization, {{and it did not}} compromise long-term QOL greatly. </p...|$|E
