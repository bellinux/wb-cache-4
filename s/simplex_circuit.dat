The British Post Office adopted the Baudot system {{for use on}} a <b>simplex</b> <b>circuit</b> between London and Paris in 1897, and subsequently made considerable use of duplex Baudot systems on their Inland Telegraph Services.|$|E

A pair of walkie-talkie two-way radios provide a <b>simplex</b> <b>circuit</b> in the ITU sense; only one party at a time can talk, while the other listens until it can hear an opportunity to transmit. The transmission medium (the radio signal over the air) can carry information in only one direction.|$|E
50|$|On 8 August 1890 he {{established}} communications between Paris, Vannes, and Lorient over a single wire. On 3 January 1894 he installed a triplex apparatus on the telegraph between Paris and Bordeaux {{that had previously}} been operating with some difficulty on the Hughes telegraph system. On 27 April 1894 {{he established}} communications between the Paris stock exchange and the Milan stock exchange, again over a single wire, using his new invention, the retransmitter. The British Post Office adopted the Baudot system in 1897 for a <b>simplex</b> <b>circuit</b> between London and Paris.|$|E
40|$|For {{real-time}} communication, {{we must be}} able {{to guarantee}} timely delivery of messages. In recent years, improvements in technology have made possible switch-based local area networks (LANs) and system area networks (SANs) that use wormhole switching, a pipelined switching technique which permits significantly shorter network latencies and higher throughputs than traditional store-and-forward packet switching. This paper proposes a model for real-time communication in such wormhole networks based on the use of real-time wormhole channels, which are <b>simplex</b> virtual <b>circuits</b> inwormhole networks with certainrealtime guarantees. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it can be used in existing wormhole networks without any special hardware support. Preliminary delay analysis and properties are shown for the proposed real-time wormhole channel model. A practical quadratic time complexity algorithm is shown for determining the feasibility of a set of wormhole channels. Finally, {{as an example of the}} utility of our model, actual parameter values obtained from experiments on a Myrinet switch-based network are used to determine if real-time guarantees are possible for an example set of real-time traffic streams intermixed with nonreal-time traffic...|$|R
40|$|Repeater {{insertion}} {{can be used}} {{to overcome}} the quadratic increase in the time required for a signal to propagate through an interconnect. A new timing model, based on short-channel equations, has been developed to characterize the signal delay through a resistive line. These analytical expressions provide the foundation for algorithms used to insert uniform repeaters into tree structures. Both local and global optimization algorithms for repeater insertion are presented. While the local optimization algorithm provides a computationally fast solution to the repeater insertion problem, the resulting circuit implementation is less power, area, and speed efficient than applying global optimization techniques. The global optimization algorithm for repeater insertion is achieved through the downhill <b>simplex</b> method. The <b>circuit</b> equations, algorithms, and software implementation of this repeater insertion system are presented in this paper. Results fro...|$|R
50|$|The Baudot {{telegraph}} {{system was}} employed progressively in France, {{and then was}} adopted in other countries, Italy being the first to introduce it, in its inland service, in 1887. The Netherlands followed in 1895, Switzerland in 1896, and Austria and Brazil in 1897. The British Post Office adopted it for a <b>simplex</b> <b>circuit</b> between London and Paris during 1897, then used it for more general purposes from 1898. In 1900 it was adopted by Germany, by Russia in 1904, the British West Indies in 1905, Spain in 1906, Belgium in 1909, Argentina in 1912, and Romania in 1913.|$|E
