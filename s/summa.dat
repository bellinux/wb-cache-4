5|$|In {{the early}} 13th century mendicant orders were founded by Francis of Assisi and Dominic de Guzmán. The studia conventualia and studia generalia of the mendicant orders played {{a large role}} in the {{transformation}} of Church sponsored cathedral schools and palace schools, such as that of Charlemagne at Aachen, into the prominent universities of Europe. Scholastic theologians and philosophers such as the Dominican priest Thomas Aquinas studied and taught at these studia. Aquinas' <b>Summa</b> Theologica was an intellectual milestone in its synthesis of the legacy of Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle with the content of Christian revelation.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer {{majored in}} chemistry, but Harvard {{required}} science students to also study history, literature, and philosophy or mathematics. He compensated for his late start by taking six courses each term and {{was admitted to}} the undergraduate honor society Phi Beta Kappa. In his first year, he was admitted to graduate standing in physics on the basis of independent study, which meant he was not required to take the basic classes and could enroll instead in advanced ones. He was attracted to experimental physics by a course on thermodynamics that was taught by Percy Bridgman. He graduated <b>summa</b> cum laude in three years.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century {{scholastic}} {{philosopher and}} theologian {{heavily influenced by}} Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his <b>Summa</b> Theologica. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God, through his Five Ways, and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist. Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that God is goodness, {{and that there is}} no evil in God.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his <b>Summa</b> Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. The ontological argument would be meaningful only to someone who understands the essence of God completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, only He could use the argument. His rejection of the ontological argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the argument.|$|E
5|$|By early April 1999, TouchWave had {{upgraded}} their WebSwitch 1608 {{local area}} network distributed phone system to a product called WebSwitch 2000. On April 13, 1999, Swedish telecommunication company Ericsson announced that it had purchased TouchWave for $46 million. In exchange for the $46M, TouchWave provided Ericsson with Internet Protocol centric network products such as business phone and private business exchanges. The acquisition of TouchWave {{came at a time}} when multibillion-dollar companies were acquiring other relatively small Internet-connected companies, such as WebLine, Selsius, GeoTel, NBX, Dialogic, and <b>Summa</b> Four. Some employees from TouchWave eventually followed serial entrepreneur and former TouchWave president and CEO Samir Lehaff to Adomo, Inc., a provider of voicemail majordomo services. TouchWave co-founder Jeff Snider would go on to be vice president of enterprise sales at Ericsson and then a CEO co-founder of Adomo in 1999.|$|E
