In [...] May 1841 Tolstoy [...] debuted with The Vampire (a novella published under the pen name of [...] "Krasnorogsky", a reference to Krasny Rog, his residence). Complicated in structure, multi-layered and rich in counterpoints, featuring both the element of [...] "horror" [...] and political satire, it instantly caught the attention of Vissarion Belinsky who praised its [...] "obviously still very young, but undoubtedly gifted author," [...] totally unaware of the latter's real identity.
