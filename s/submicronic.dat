40|$|AbstractInhalational drugs often {{suffer from}} low {{pulmonary}} deposition {{due to their}} micronized size. Aim of present study was development and evaluation of a novel <b>submicronic</b> L-arginine respiratory fluid formulation for treatment of cardiopulmonary complications associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). Objectives were (a) to develop and characterize <b>submicronic</b> L-arginine respiratory fluid formulation, (b) pre-clinical safety/toxicity study in 2 -animal species, (c) in vitro and in vivo evaluation in terms of respiratory fraction, and (d) clinical study to assess safety/efficacy in healthy volunteers/COPD patients. Formulation was optimized {{on the basis of}} particle size of aerosolized medication with particle size in the range of 400 – 500 nm. Anderson cascade impaction (ACI) studies were performed to validate the advantage in terms of respirable fraction, which indicated a high respirable fraction (51. 61 ± 3. 28) for the developed formulation. In vivo pulmonary deposition pattern of optimized formulation was studied using gamma scintigraphy in human volunteers using 99 mTc-arginine as radiotracer. It clearly demonstrated a significant pulmonary deposition of the <b>submicronic</b> formulation in various lung compartments. Efficacy of the developed formulation was further assessed in COPD patients (n= 15) by evaluating its effect on various cardiopulmonary parameters (spirometry, pulse-oxymetry, echocardiography and 6 -min walk test). A marked improvement was seen in patients after inhalation of <b>submicronic</b> arginine in terms of their cardiopulmonary status. Results suggest that <b>submicronic</b> arginine respiratory fluid {{has the potential to be}} developed into an attractive therapeutic option for treating COPD associated cardiopulmonary complications...|$|E

40|$|Spherical, <b>submicronic</b> TiO 2 powder {{particles}} {{were prepared}} {{in the low}} temperature process of ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (150 °C) by using as a precursor aqueous colloidal solutions consisting of surface modified 45 Å TiO 2 nanoparticles with dopamine. Detailed structural and morphological characterization of colored <b>submicronic</b> TiO 2 spheres was performed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), laser particle size analysis and FTIR techniques. Also, optical characterization of both dopamine-modified TiO 2 precursor nanoparticles and <b>submicronic</b> TiO 2 powder particles was performed using absorption and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, respectively. A significant decrease of the effective band gap (1. 9 eV) in dopamine-modified TiO 2 nanoparticles compared to the band gap of bulk material (3. 2 eV) was preserved after formation of <b>submicronic</b> TiO 2 powder particles {{in the process of}} ultrasonic spray pyrolysis under mild experimental conditions. Due to the nanostructured nature, surface-modified assemblage of TiO 2 nanoparticles preserved unique ability to absorb light through charge transfer complex by photoexcitation of the ligand-to-TiO 2 band, conventionally associated with extremely small TiO 2 nanoparticles (d < 20 nm) whose surface Ti atoms, owing to the large curvature, have penta-coordinate geometry...|$|E

The French community involved in air quality monitoring early got interested in the measurement of <b>submicronic</b> particles. Since 2003 INERIS has carried out monitoring campaigns {{once or twice a}} year in an urban site located near Paris, enabling the constitution of a large hourly database. Besides air quality measurements, other variables have been introduced into the database: traffic and heating emissions provided by the local air quality monitoring agency (AIRPARIF); meteorological variables issued from monitoring or extracted from the meteorological MM 5 model (height of the boundary layer). An exploratory study of the data collected from 2003 to 2007 has been performed.

Corrections accounting for shadowing and multiple scattering are included in the model. The result is compared to rigorous numerical simulations using a Monte-Carlo algorithm.

40|$|The massive basal {{skeleton}} of a few remnant living hypercalcified sponges rediscovered since the 1960 s are valuable representatives of ancient calcium carbonate biomineralization mechanisms in basal Metazoa. A multi-scale mineralogical characterization of the easily accessible Mediterranean living hypercalcified sponge belonging to Calcarea, Petrobiona massiliana (Vacelet and Lévi, 1958), was conducted. Oriented observations in light and electron microscopy of mature and growing areas of the Mg-calcite basal skeleton were combined in order to describe all structural levels from the <b>submicronic</b> to the macroscopic scale. The smallest units produced are ca. 50 - 100 nm grains that are in a mushy amorphous state before their crystallization. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) further demonstrated that <b>submicronic</b> grains are assembled into crystallographically coherent clusters or fibers, the latter are even laterally associated into single-crystal bundles. A model of crystallization propagation through amorphous <b>submicronic</b> granular units is proposed to explain the formation of coherent micron-scale structural units. Finally, XRD and EELS analyses highlighted, respectively, inter-individual variation of skeletal Mg contents and heterogeneous spatial distribution of Ca ions in skeletal fibers. All mineralogical features presented here cannot be explained by classical inorganic crystallization principles in super-saturated solutions, but rather underlined a highly biologically regulated formation of the basal skeleton. This study extending recent observations on corals, mollusk and echinoderms confirms that occurrence of <b>submicronic</b> granular units and a possible transient amorphous precursor phase in calcium carbonate skeletons is a common biomineralization strategy already selected by basal metazoans. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Experimental {{results on}} wet {{electrostatic}} scrubbing of <b>submicronic</b> particles, {{produced by a}} model combustion process, are reported. This process {{should be used to}} develop new technologies to reduce environmental footprint of industry and transportation, but also for the cleaning of indoor air or virus abatement, and may have application to the recovery of precious by-products in particulate forms (e. g. entrained catalysts in process gas streams). Experiments were carried out in a lab-scale facility that was purposely designed and optimized to perform tests with a train of falling droplets of identical size and charge, which scrubs a closed volume of gas containing pre-charged <b>submicronic</b> particles at opposite polarity. The experimental campaign aimed to assess the effects of droplet and particle charge and number of scrubbing droplets on the efficiency of wet electrostatic scrubbing. Results were interpreted with a model derived from the theory on wet scavenging of aerosol particles in atmosphere showing a good matching between experimental and theoretical data. Experimental results and modeling demonstrated that the process was dominated by electrostatic interactions among droplets and particles. Particle removal efficiency, in the <b>submicronic</b> range, was favored by higher particles and droplet charges, while image charge seem to have a negligible effect on particle abatement when only the droplets are charged. Results allowed assessment of guidelines for the design of wet electrostatics scrubbers for particle abatement, which are discussed in the paper with reference to a specific case study...|$|E

Since 2009, particle number concentration data have also been provided by 3031 measurements. An exploratory study of the data collected from 2003 to 2007, which focused on particles with diameter in the 10 nm to 500 nm range, was performed in 2008 - 2009 and presented at the EFCA 2009 symposium.

A synthetic scheme explaining the daily evolution of <b>submicronic</b> particle concentrations as a function of emissions and meteorology was established. More recently, following the EFCA symposium, investigations have been carried out thanks to additional monitoring campaigns and the enlargement of the summer database, previously limited to three weeks of measurements. Particle number concentrations over those three weeks appeared to be significantly higher than those measured in winter and revealed enhanced photochemical activity. Two recent campaigns of 7 to 11 weeks provided values inferior to winter concentrations, which is in better agreement with data from other European studies.
