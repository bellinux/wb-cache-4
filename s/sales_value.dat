40|$|SIGNIFICANCE: The tobacco {{industry}} argues that tobacco sales {{are important to}} small retailersâ€™ business. We examined 1) tobacco gross margins, sales, and profits in small shops, 2) differences by area deprivation and smoking prevalence, and 3) the role of e-cigarettes. METHODS: Sales data from 1447 shops covering two 2 -week periods in 2015 (weeks starting 1 June, 8 June, 14 Sept, 21 Sept) recorded by electronic point of sale systems (EPOS) in small shops in the UK were obtained from an EPOS company. Data were aggregated into weekly tobacco, non-tobacco, and e-cigarette <b>sales</b> <b>values,</b> gross margins, <b>sales</b> quantities, and transactions. RESULTS: For the week starting 21 Sept (N= 1416), mean gross margins on tobacco products were 6. 6 % (SD= 2. 2) and 24. 1 % (SD= 4. 9) on non-tobacco products. Mean total <b>sales</b> <b>values</b> (tobacco+non-tobacco <b>sales)</b> =Â£ 14, 893. 58 (SD= 8543. 91) while mean tobacco sales=Â£ 3, 716. 17 (SD= 2087. 16), thus tobacco accounted for 26. 0 % (SD= 0. 08) of total sales. Mean total gross profits=Â£ 2, 894. 54 (SD= 1788. 81) while mean gross profits from tobacco were only Â£ 241. 80 (SD= 165. 41), thus tobacco accounted for 9. 1 % (SD= 0. 05) of total profits. Area smoking prevalence and deprivation were both positively correlated with tobacco <b>sales</b> <b>values</b> and tobacco gross profits, but negatively correlated with tobacco gross margins (p< 0. 0001 for all). N= 550 shops {{had at least one}} e-cigarette transaction, with a mean of 3. 2 (SD= 5. 3) transactions and mean gross margins of 43. 4 % (SD= 10. 5). Week 4 (N= 1416) was chosen for presentation because it was the most current and had fewer EPOS errors. Findings across the 4 weeks were similar although small differences were found, including tobacco and total <b>sales</b> <b>values</b> (p< 0. 0001). Tobacco gross margins did not differ (p= 0. 68). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high <b>sales</b> <b>values,</b> tobacco has low gross margins compared to other products. Tobacco <b>sales</b> <b>values</b> are higher in more deprived/higher smoking prevalence areas. The lower gross margins on tobacco in more deprived/higher smoking prevalence areas suggest that more smokers in these areas smoke cheap discount brands. E-cigarettes have high gross margins but transactions in small shops are low...|$|R
