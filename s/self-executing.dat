We recently proposed a lifelong autobiographical memory architecture tackling some of these challenges, allowing the iCub humanoid robot to 1) create new memories for both actions that are <b>self-executed</b> and observed from humans, 2) continuously annotate these actions in an unsupervised manner, and 3) use reasoning modules to augment these memories a-posteriori. In this paper, we present a reasoning algorithm which generalises the robots’ understanding of actions by finding the point of commonalities with the former ones. In particular, we generated and labelled templates of pointing actions in different directions. This represents a first step towards the emergence of a procedural memory within a long-term autobiographical memory framework for robots...|$|R

The study corresponds to a joint research of parallel type with concurrent triangulation. The study populations were made up by twenty-six young adult people (who face morbid process health or chronic pain condition) and four nursing professionals who worked in the Clinic of Pain Control and Palliative Care and in the Onco-hematology Service of the Max Peralta Hospital. A <b>self-executed</b> questionnaire and a semi-structured interview were used to collect the information, which was analyzed using the “SPSS” program and the qualitative categories, respectively. Results: The ten elements of the “Human Care Theory” can be included in the care given by the nursing personnel to the young adult population who faces morbid process health or chronic pain condition. The nursing care mainly focuses on the young adult population quality of life throughout education and pain management. The young adult population perceives a warm, pleasant and human nursing care.

40|$|The {{anterior}} {{portion of}} the inferior parietal cortex possesses comprehensive representations of actions embedded in behavioural contexts. Mirror neurons, which respond to both <b>self-executed</b> and observed actions, exist in this brain region {{in addition to those}} originally found in the premotor cortex. We found that parietal mirror neurons responded differentially to identical actions embedded in different contexts. Another type of parietal mirror neuron represents an inverse and complementary property of responding equally to dissimilar actions made by itself and others for an identical purpose. Here, we propose a hypothesis that these sets of inferior parietal neurons constitute a neural basis for encoding the semantic equivalence of various actions across different agents and contexts. The neurons have mirror neuron properties, and they encoded generalization of agents, differentiation of outcomes, and categorization of actions that led to common functions. By integrating the activities of these mirror neurons with various codings, we further suggest that in the ancestral primates' brains, these various representations of meaningful action led to the gradual establishment of equivalence relations among the different types of actions, by sharing common action semantics. Such differential codings of the components of actions might represent precursors to the parts of protolanguage, such as gestural communication, which are shared among various members of a society. Finally, we suggest that the inferior parietal cortex serves as an interface between this action semantics system and other higher semantic systems, through common structures of action representation that mimic language syntax...|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} of this work is domestic development of electronics instruments. It used for measuring ionization radiation and practical training at Nuclear Research Institute (NRI), Dalat, Vietnam. The aim of this work is to study and develop a novel MCA 8 k for Gamma-ray spectrometer concerning experimental nuclear physics. An approach for design and construction of the aforementioned instrument is to apply logic integrating techniques via Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) under Max[*]+[*]PlusII, Altera. The instrument allows interfacing to PC with self-developed application software. Scientific significance of this work is partly to contribute to opening a research direction {{in the field of}} nuclear electronics science for design and construction of radiation measurement instruments with the advanced IC technology in Vietnam. Practical significance of this work is partly to contribute to enhancement of capabilities in developing radiation measurement instruments for experimental research as well as practical training in nuclear physics. The advantages of FPGA: overcoming ballistic deficit, decrement of serial and parallel noise, flexible in programming, control of the system by software without an interfere of hardware. The disadvantages of FPGA: requirement of good knowledge of VHDL and professional tools for development of a expected project. A new electronics module of MCA 8 k has been achieved. Some main results obtained from the experimental testing are as follows: differential nonlinearity (DNL) of FPGA-MCA 8 k approximately 1.27 %, integral nonlinearity (INL) = 0.607 %, time conversion[*]≈[*] 2.2  μs, deadtime (DT) is 0.75 %.

40|$|Prediction of "when" {{a partner}} will act and "what" {{he is going}} to do is crucial in joint-action contexts. However, studies on {{face-to-face}} interactions in which two people have to mutually adjust their movements in time and space are lacking. Moreover, while studies on passive observation have shown that somato-motor simulative processes are disrupted when the observed actor is perceived as an out-group or unfair individual, the impact of interpersonal perception on joint-actions has never been directly addressed. Here we explored this issue by comparing the ability of pairs of participants who did or did not undergo an interpersonal perception manipulation procedure to synchronise their reach-to-grasp movements during: i) a guided interaction, requiring pure temporal reciprocal coordination, and ii) a free interaction, requiring both time and space adjustments. Behavioural results demonstrate that while in neutral situations free and guided interactions are equally challenging for participants, a negative interpersonal relationship improves performance in guided interactions {{at the expense of the}} free interactive ones. This was paralleled at the kinematic level by the absence of movement corrections and by low movement variability in these participants, indicating that partners cooperating within a negative interpersonal bond executed the cooperative task on their own, without reciprocally adapting to the partner's motor behaviour. Crucially, participants' performance in the free interaction improved in the manipulated group during the second experimental session while partners became interdependent as suggested by higher movement variability and by the appearance of interference between the <b>self-executed</b> actions and those observed in the partner. Our study expands current knowledge about on-line motor interactions by showing that visuo-motor interference effects, mutual motor adjustments and motor-learning mechanisms are influenced by social perception. © 2012 Sacheli et al...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the current}} Dutch {{construction}} industry, complex and extensive civil engineering projects are often executed by private partnerships, {{with a public}} client (the Dutch department of public works, better known as Rijkswaterstaat). Large projects in this context are considered multimillion euro projects, characterised as uncertain, complex, politically sensitive and involving {{a large number of}} stakeholders. Multiple research on such projects is already done over the past years, especially on ‘hard factors’, like risk management or supply chain control. However, research on ‘soft factors’ like collaboration is limited but desirable due to struggle as identified in practice. The size of the projects and the associated large amount financial resources, reference requirements and risk involved, causes that company are willing to step into a partnership. Out of these companies a joint organisation (or joint venture) is established, in which collaboration is necessary to reach shared project success. The different backgrounds of the individuals entering the project on a temporary basis, has proved to be difficult in practise. The combination of individuals derived from different parent companies, all having a specific specialism and having more or less experience in the sector, causes a complex situation regarding collaboration. This thesis is aimed at providing insight into the individuals’ perspectives into factors influencing collaboration in a specific formed centre of collaboration, using the following research question: Which factors influence collaboration according to an individual’s view, in a specific formed centre of collaboration? To generate the required data for answering the research question, Q-methodology is used {{within the context of a}} single-case. Q-methodology starts with the definition of a concourse, which is the sum of all information about the main issue (here: factors influencing collaboration). A combination of five researches (both comparative and <b>self-executed)</b> provides a set of forty-six factors and criteria regarding collaboration, which forms the base for this study. These forty-six items are clustered into six categories: trust, organisation, purpose, communication, risk and incentives. After comparison and selection of the items, nineteen factors remained to use for this research: (1) Atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding; (2) Confidence in each other’s skills; (3) Trust and support from the client; (4) Variety in team composition; (5) Availability resources; (6) Clear project role guidelines; (7) Shared objectives; (8) Attainable goals; (9) Project focussing; (10) Formal communication; (11) Informal communication; (12) Open and honest communication; (13) Understand each other’s language; (14) High technical complexity; (15) Clarity about risk allocation; (16) Gain and pain sharing; (17) Cooperative attitude; (18) Repetitiveness of collaboration; (19) Common priorities. These factors are translated into statements, known as the Q-set, which form the base for the Q-sorting process. Within this process, the twenty-eight respondents as selected in the case are confronted with the statements and asked to rank them relatively by the degree of importance using the main theme: “To achieve good collaboration within a project team it is important that [...] ” For the most salient outcomes an explanation is given by the respondents in short interviews afterwards, which is used for the interpretation of the data. Analysis showed that respondents agreed on the degree of (un) importance of nine of the nineteen statements, which signifies a high consensus in opinion. Two factors which are considered as most important by the majority of respondents are: “open and honest communication” and “an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding”. Despite of the recognition of the importance of these two factors, respondents argue that both items are hard to achieve because of the different interests of individuals, as an effect of the different parent companies and the different departments in the organisation individuals act in. Though the relatively high degree of consensus, also several differences can be identified, which makes it possible to formulate and characterise (three) different perspectives, which can be seen as clusters of correlated viewpoints of respondents. After a quantitative data analysis the perspectives are ualitatively interpreted. The three perspectives as derived are labelled as: (1) Perspective A: “The idealistic team worker”; This person represents someone who attaches importance towards the mental part, with a certain distance from reality. It is a supportive individual, who is known for its flexibility and adaptability to different situations and environments. This person is considered an unconditionally collaborator. (2) Perspective B: “The socialistic co-ordinator”; This person represents someone who strives for equality, has a certain degree of solidarity and puts the collective interest of the team on top of their priority list. It is a conditional collaborator, having a strong focus on their internal team and own framework, which neglects the outside world. In addition, its effectiveness will be optimal when working in a small, restricted team. (3) Perspective C: “The pragmatic implementer”; This person represents someone who aims for a pragmatic attitude, which places production above collaboration. He or she is known for routine, practical common-sense and self-discipline. This person works hard, but needs guidance. This individual is generally not suitable for an umbrella function, because of the lack of seeing the bigger picture. It is tried to link the different perspectives with one or more of the three characteristics of the respondents, which are ‘parent company’, ‘organisation’s department’ and ‘work experience’. Apparently, these characteristics do not have a clear influence on the individual’s viewpoint towards factors influencing collaboration. The differences in perspectives may not be find in the individual’s characteristics as identified and may even be found in the deeper layer of what drives people to act and to react. Collaboration was shown to be dynamic and a deeply rooted emotional process, which cannot easily traced down to unambiguous characteristics. Earlier research already showed that effective teams include a variety of types of individuals. Nevertheless, the confrontation of these different individuals causes conflict on the shop floor. While confronting the different perspectives of this research, conflict occurs between both perspective A and B, A and C and B and C; all for different reasons. The main source of these conflicts can be found in a discrepancy in expectations and the individual’s needs, which should be solved by the individuals themselves. Therefore the main management implication is to be found in bringing people together and within the confrontation of individuals. The outcomes of the research are mirrored against a research on collaboration of thirty-eight years ago, which showed to be outdated. Especially conflict over costs became more important over the years. An increased cost awareness and need for cost effectiveness over the years caused that conflicts over (and attention for) costs became more and more accurate. In addition, were the technical options and performance trade-offs are seen as a source of conflict thirty-eight years ago, this research aims that technical complexity is a side effect of the sector and something that can be managed by specialists. As an indicator for collaboration effectiveness, the maturity levels of Meng et al. (2011) are used. Analysis showed that the organisation as identified does not (yet) reach full maturity (which is ultimately desired). To reach higher maturity, attention should be paid to the identified sources of conflict as well as to the factors indicated as important by all perspectives (“open and honest communication” and “an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding”). As a remark, it should be clear that all factors extracted from literature are considered influential on collaboration and therefore not one factor should be neglected. An extreme focus on only those factors which came forward within this research may cause deterioration of others. In addition, it needs to be mentioned that although individuals think in a certain maturity level, they do not necessarily act in the same level. This research was indented to explore the individual’s view on factors influencing collaboration, not to explore how these individuals actually act. In a people process (like within collaboration) a researcher (as well as a manager) should always be aware of the discrepancy between thinking and acting of individuals. Looking back to the main research question it can be concluded that the research results generally show a common view towards factors influencing collaboration, but that some nuances are visible. The three different perspectives of individuals show the differences in viewpoints. Although some consensus exists, the discovery of the existence of different types of individuals is a step forward in an improved internal collaboration situation.

2500|$|Russian {{scholars}} have disputed this retroactivity issue at length. Gavrilov, for instance, who had {{argued for the}} Russian reservation to the Berne Convention, kept defending it, while others disagreed. Maggs and Sergeyev, for instance, pointed out in 2000 that the reservation was inadmissible under article 30(1) of the Berne Convention; Podshibikhin and Leontiev agreed in 2002. [...] The modification of the copyright law through law 72-FL in 2004 refuelled the discussion, because this law added a new paragraph 4 to article 5 of the 1993 copyright law which clearly stated under which conditions foreign works were copyrighted in Russia, using a wording that corresponded in essence to articles 18(1) and 18(2) of the Berne Convention. Nevertheless, Gavrilov continued arguing in favour of the non-protection of pre-1973 foreign works, arguing {{that this was not}} so much a reservation to the Berne Convention but merely an interpretation, whereas others considered the 2004 amendments to finally do away with this reservation and claimed that law 72-FL restored copyright in Russia on pre-1973 foreign works. According to the Russian representative at the negotiations on Russia's accession to the WTO, law 72-FL indeed was intended to rescind the non-retroactivity reservation, thereby restoring copyrights on pre-1973 foreign works. The Russian copyright law (already before 2004) also considered international treaties <b>self-executing</b> and to take precedence over the Russian law (article 3). The common practice in Russia nevertheless did not change; pre-1973 foreign works were commonly considered to be uncopyrighted in Russia due to this reservation.|$|E
