50|$|Closures need a {{means of}} {{attaching}} to the container with sufficient <b>security.</b> <b>Threads,</b> lugs, hinges, locks, adhesives, etc. are used.|$|R
25|$|Security thread: When {{the note}} is held against the light, the <b>security</b> <b>thread</b> {{appears as a}} dark line. The Euro symbol (€) {{and the value of}} the {{banknote}} can be seen in tiny white lettering in the thread.|$|E
25|$|The new {{security}} features were: a windowed <b>security</b> <b>thread</b> (with the notes' denominations in microprinting), watermarks, microprinting, intaglio printing (viewing-angle dependent visibility {{as well as}} a Braille representation of the notes denomination), colour-shifting ink (on the DM 500 and 1000 denominations), a see-through register and ultraviolet-visible security features.|$|E
25|$|On 27 July 2010, the Bank of Thailand {{announced}} that the 16th series banknotes would enter circulation in December 2010. On 9 August 2012, the Bank of Thailand issued a new denomination banknote, 80 baht, to commemorate queen Sirikit's 80th birthday. It was the first Thai banknote that featured Crane's Motion <b>security</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Security</b> <b>threads</b> {{can also}} be used as an anti-counterfeiting device in passports. They are {{generally}} made of plastic and contain microprinting.|$|R
25|$|<b>Security</b> <b>threads</b> are {{inserted}} into the note so that horizontal and vertical lines are shown from top to bottom. The threads can be varied in the materials, size, colour and design.|$|R
25|$|The minimum {{security}} features {{visible to the}} naked eye are watermarks, electrotypes and <b>security</b> <b>threads</b> with colour fibres. Extra features may be included, such as holograms, Irisafe, iridescent stripes, clear windows, metameric windows and gold patches.|$|R
25|$|Banknotes {{produced}} during the Second World War were overprinted with different letters so that particular batches {{could be identified}} and removed from circulation if they were lost in transit between the printers in Britain and Dublin. Notes issued on and from 1961 no longer bore the promise of exchange in London. In 1971 the £1, £5 and £10 received {{the addition of a}} metal <b>security</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|E
25|$|Moving image <b>security</b> <b>thread</b> ("Motion"): The 50,000 won note has {{a special}} blue and gray film with {{numerous}} Taegeuk patterns all over it. Taegeuk patterns move {{to the left and}} right when the note is tilted up and down, while moving up and down when the note is tilted to the left and right. When the note is held up to the light, the movement of the Taegeuk patterns appears more clearly.|$|E
25|$|Higher-denomination {{notes of}} 5,000 and 10,000 won were {{introduced}} in 1972 and 1973, respectively. The notes incorporated new security features, including watermark, <b>security</b> <b>thread,</b> and ultraviolet response fibres, and were intaglio printed. The release of 10,000-won notes was planned {{to be at the}} same time as the 5,000-won notes, but problems with the main theme delayed it by a year. Newly designed 500-won notes were also released in 1973, and the need for a medium denomination resulted in the introduction of 1,000-won notes in 1975.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Security</b> <b>threads</b> {{are put in}} {{the middle}} of the note's {{materials}} so horizontal and vertical lines are shown from top to bottom. The threads also can be made with many variations such as the materials, size, colour and design.|$|R
5|$|The 2007 {{banknote}} series was {{prepared by the}} Reserve Bank in October 2006 for the abandoned second phase of Operation Sunrise. The Chiremba Balancing Rocks was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark continued. There were additional security features as opposed to previous issues, which included <b>security</b> <b>threads,</b> see-through register marks and recognition marks for the partially sighted. Holographic <b>security</b> <b>threads</b> and Optically Variable Ink were used on the $100, $500 and $1000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred these notes were put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.|$|R

25|$|October 27, 1997: Major {{design changes}} were {{implemented}} under Series 1996 to further deter counterfeiters. Included were an enlarged and off-center portrait, an enlarged and updated {{view of the}} U.S. Capitol now showing the west front on the reverse, a <b>security</b> <b>thread</b> which glows yellow under ultraviolet light, a numeric 50 which shifts color from black to green when tilted, and a watermark of Grant. Also, for those with vision limitations, a large dark 50 {{was added to the}} bottom left corner of the reverse. The Federal Reserve seal was also changed to a unified Federal Reserve System seal and an additional prefix letter was added {{to the beginning of the}} bill's serial number. The first bills were printed in July 1997.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} the 'Bridge' banknotes was initiated in 2006 by the Danish National Bank. The {{theme of the}} new banknotes is Danish bridges and the surrounding landscapes, or details from these landscapes. Danish artist Karin Birgitte Lund has chosen to interpret this theme in two ways: bridges as links between various parts of Denmark and as links between {{the past and the}} present. The present is represented by the bridges, the past by five distinctive prehistoric objects found near the bridges. Among the new security features is a window thread ("Motion") with a moving wave pattern. Another feature is a new, sophisticated hologram that reflects light in different colors. The new banknotes also have the traditional security features such as the watermark and the hidden <b>security</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|E
25|$|March 25, 1996: The {{first major}} design change since 1929 took {{place with the}} {{adoption}} of a contemporary style layout. The main intent of the new design was to deter counterfeiting. New security features included a watermark of Franklin to {{the right side of the}} bill, optically variable ink (OVI) that changed from green to black when viewed at different angles, a higher quality and enlarged portrait of Franklin, and hard-to-reproduce fine line printing around Franklin's portrait and Independence Hall. Older security features such as interwoven red and blue silk fibers, microprinting, and a plastic <b>security</b> <b>thread</b> (which now glows pink (nominally red) under a black light) were kept. The individual Federal Reserve Bank Seal was changed to a unified Federal Reserve Seal along with an additional prefix letter being added to the serial number, w. The first of the Series 1996 bills were produced in October 1995.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{internet}} play a {{vital role}} in our communication infrastructure and faces the challenges using cloud computing security. In this work we strive to frame the full space of cloud-computing <b>security</b> <b>threads,</b> attempting to individual concerns for every organization jobs from possible over-reactions. We suggest that few cloud computing security issues are basically new or fundamentally intractable, and so many applications in all organization needed by introducing a new concept of cloud computing in their environment using <b>security</b> <b>threads</b> in cloud computing. Few we have seen to the time-sharing and distributed period, many of these problems already received great response. On the other hand, we argue that two particular aspects are to some degree new and fundamental to cloud computing: the complexities of multiparty trust and the ensuing need is equally done for mutual audit ability...|$|R

50|$|Several new {{security}} features have {{been incorporated into}} this series. Microprinting, windowed <b>security</b> <b>threads,</b> perfect registration devices and lithographic printing have been included. The NT$2,000 was initially the only banknote to feature a holographic patch, being the highest denomination banknote in public circulation. This feature has since been extended to NT$500 and NT$1,000 banknotes, which now include a holographic strip.|$|R
25|$|The Reserve Bank of India was {{formally}} inaugurated on Monday, 1 April 1935 with its Central Office at Calcutta. Section 22 of the RBI Act, 1934, empowered it to continue issuing Government of India notes until its own notes {{were ready for}} issue. The bank issued the first five rupee note bearing the portrait of George VI in 1938. This was followed by Rs. 10 in February, Rs 100 in March and Rs 1,000 and Rs 10,000 in June 1938. The first Reserve Bank issues were signed by the second Governor, Sir James Taylor. In August 1940, the one-rupee note was reintroduced as a wartime measure, as a Government note with {{the status of a}} rupee coin. During the war, the Japanese produced high-quality forgeries of the Indian currency. This necessitated a change in the watermark. The profile portrait of George VI was changed to his full frontal portrait. The <b>security</b> <b>thread</b> was introduced {{for the first time in}} India. The George VI series continued till 1947 and thereafter as a frozen series till 1950 when post-independence notes were issued.|$|E
25|$|The first 50 million {{pieces of}} the new RM50 {{banknote}} features Malaysia's first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, at the historic declaration of Malaya's independence, and the logo of the 50th Anniversary of Independence on the reverse. Security features on the banknote include a watermarked portrait of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, a <b>security</b> <b>thread,</b> micro letterings, fluorescent elements visible only under ultraviolet light, a multi coloured latent image which changes colour when viewed at different angles, and a holographic stripe {{at the side of}} the note and an image that is visible only via a moiré effect to prevent counterfeiting using photocopiers. Circulation for the first edition of this new RM50 banknote was eventually curtailed by the Central Bank due to the various Malaysia banks' automatic teller machines inability to accept it. The bank began to re-release the new series for general circulation beginning 15 July 2009 without the 50th Anniversary logo. This edition include new enhanced security features such as two color number fluorescents and security fibres.|$|E

5|$|Other {{security}} features include lithographic print (the resulting background hinders camera counterfeiting), anti-copying line structures, perfect registration, microprinting, asymmetrical serial numbers and windowed <b>security</b> <b>threads</b> (thin ribbons {{woven into the}} paper). Polymer versions of the banknote include two clear windows and other {{security features}} that substitute its paper version. Several features that are invisible {{to the naked eye}} appear when both versions of the banknote are exposed under UV light.|$|R
25|$|The {{banknotes}} vary in {{size and}} colour, with larger denominations being longer than smaller ones. All contain multiple colours. However, each denomination does have one colour which predominates. All banknotes feature a watermark for security purposes. On the larger denomination notes, the watermark {{is a picture of}} Jinnah, while on smaller notes, it is a crescent and star. Different types of <b>security</b> <b>threads</b> are also present in each banknote.|$|R
500|$|Although the {{discussion}} {{was supposed to}} be secret, in November 1939 Michael Palairet, Britain's ambassador to Greece, met a Russian émigré who gave him full details of the plan discussed at the 18 September meeting; according to the émigré's report, the plan was titled [...] "Offensive against Sterling and Destruction of its Position as World Currency". Palairet reported the information to London, who alerted the US Department of the Treasury and the Bank of England. Although the Bank considered the existing security measures were sufficient, in 1940 it released a blue emergency £1 note which had a metal <b>security</b> <b>thread</b> running through the paper. It also banned the import of pound notes {{for the duration of the}} war in 1943, stopped producing new £5 notes and warned the public about the danger of counterfeit currency.|$|E

40|$|This final thesis {{describes}} the currently available processes for testing <b>security</b> <b>threads</b> in banknote papers. The currency market has generally {{two types of}} <b>security</b> <b>threads,</b> embedded and window threads.   It is generally important to optimize the adhesive used. This requires a test method with good precision and low operator independence. By achieving and using good test methods the process of evaluating a new products pros and cons {{can be done with}} higher precision. The thread adhesion properties are of great importance when developing new adhesion systems. The main reason for testing the threads adhesion is to verify that the thread cannot be removed in an intact form from the banknote but also for product development processes.   The current test methods were developed by introducing new parameters and sample preparations specifications. The data evaluation system was also upgraded.   The measurement of thread adhesion vs. position in CD and vs. time showed expected results. A new and more reliable test method was implemented and evaluated and was together with the improved current method able to detect same properties independently...|$|R
