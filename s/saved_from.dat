40|$|Few {{studies have}} tried to measure how {{households}} in a developing country <b>save</b> <b>from</b> each of the different income sources at their disposal. To help fill that gap, the Author uses five-year panel data to examine how households in rural Pakistan <b>save</b> <b>from</b> {{each of the seven}} separate sources of income. The author finds that households <b>save</b> <b>from</b> different sources of income at significantly different marginal rates. For example, the marginal propensity to <b>save</b> <b>from</b> external remittances (0. 711) is much higher than that for rental income (0. 085). As the precautionary model of saving suggests, the reasons for this relate to uncertainty: income that is more variable, tends to be saved at a higher marginal rate. Faced with incomplete capital, and credit markets, households in rural Pakistan save: for a rainy day"by putting away mainly those sources of income that are more variable, and uncertain.
