5|$|Caron and Jackson {{found that}} about 25% of the 172 known species were {{abundant}} and widespread throughout the time {{range of the}} GPB, {{while the majority of}} species were rare, and occurred in a small area {{for a short period of}} time. In most layers the five most abundant species accounted for 50% to 75% of individual animals. The <b>species</b> <b>that</b> had wide ranges in time and space may have been generalists, while the rest were specialists in particular types of environment. Alternatively some wide-ranging species may have been opportunists that were quick to recolonize the area after each burial event. The 6 <b>species</b> <b>that</b> appeared in all layers were very probably generalists.|$|E

5|$|Plant <b>species</b> <b>that</b> {{are genetically}} {{compatible}} may not hybridize in nature for various reasons, including geographical isolation, differences in flowering period, or differences in pollinators. <b>Species</b> <b>that</b> are brought together by humans in gardens may hybridize naturally, or hybridization can be facilitated by human efforts, such as altered flowering period or artificial pollination. Hybrids are sometimes created by humans to produce improved plants that {{have some of}} the characteristics of each of the parent species. Much work is now being done with hybrids between crops and their wild relatives to improve disease-resistance or climate resilience for both agricultural and horticultural crops.|$|E
