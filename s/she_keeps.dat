5|$|Items 77–81 in {{the code}} have been {{interpreted}} as {{a description of a}} woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation.

5|$|In the {{original}} pre-Crisis continuity, Kathy Kane, a wealthy Gotham City heiress and former circus performer, decides {{to use her}} skills and resources to become a costumed crime-fighter. This is partly out of altruism and partly to attract the romantic attentions of Batman. During the Silver Age of Comics, Batwoman guest-starred occasionally in Batman stories published from 1956 to 1964. While Batman wished for Kane to retire from crime-fighting due to the danger, she remained his ally, even when she temporarily became {{a new version of}} Catwoman. In 1961, Batwoman was joined by her niece Betty Kane, the Bat-Girl. Kathy and Betty were romantically interested in Batman and Robin, respectively. Robin seemed to return Bat-Girl's affection, while Batman remained aloof. In 1964 however, DC dropped Batwoman, as well as Bat-Girl, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite from the Batman titles, which were undergoing a revamp under editor Julius Schwartz that eliminated many of the sci-fi elements that were introduced in the 1950s. However, Batwoman continues to make appearances in stories published during the next few years in the Batman-Superman team-up book World's Finest. The character would later reappear in the late 1970s, made guest appearances in the Batman Family and Freedom Fighters comic book series, often fighting crime alongside Barbara Gordon, who had become the new Batgirl. In a story depicting Batwoman as a retired crimefighter, she becomes the owner of a circus, which <b>she</b> <b>keeps</b> until killed by the League of Assassins and the brainwashed Bronze Tiger.|$|E

As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally.
