In unsaturated soils, the excess pore-water and pore-air pressures simultaneously change during the consolidation procedure; and the solutions {{are not easy to}} obtain. The present paper uses the differential quadrature method (DQM) for axisymmetric consolidation of unsaturated soils in a <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> foundation. The radial seepage of <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> foundation is considered based on the framework of Fredlund’s one-dimensional consolidation theory in unsaturated soils. With the use of Darcy’s law and Fick’s law, the polar governing equations of excess pore-air and pore-water pressures of axisymmetric consolidation are derived. By using DQM, the two governing equations are transformed into two sets of ordinary differential equations. Then the solutions of excess pore-water and pore-air pressures can be obtained by Rong-Kutta method. The DQM solution can be used to deal with the case of nonuniform initial pore-air and pore-water distributions. Finally, case studies are presented to investigate the behavior of axisymmetric consolidation of unsaturated soils. The convergence analysis and average degree of consolidation, the settlements in radial and vertical direction, and the effects of different initial excess pore pressure distributions are presented, and discussed in this paper...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the performance of geogrid reinforced soil walls with panel facing using marginal backfill with and without chimney <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> subjected to seepage. A series of centrifuge model tests were performed at 40 gravities using a 4. 5 m radius large beam centrifuge facility available at IIT Bombay. The results revealed that a geogrid reinforced soil wall with low stiffness geogrid and without any chimney drain experienced a catastrophic failure due to excess pore water pressure that developed in the reinforced and backfill zones at the onset of seepage. In comparison, a soil wall reinforced with stiff geogrid layers was found to perform effectively even at the onset of seepage. Provision of chimney <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> effectively decreased pore water pressure not only at the wall toe but also at mid distance from toe of the wall and thereby resulted in enhancing the wall performance under the effect of seepage forces. However, a local piping failure was observed near the toe region of the wall. The observed centrifuge test results were further analysed by performing seepage and stability analyses to evaluate the effect of thickness of sand layer in a chimney drain. An increase in thickness of sand layer in chimney drain was found to improve the discharge values and thereby enhancing the factor of safety against piping near the toe region. Based on the analysis and interpretation of centrifuge test results, it can be concluded that marginal soil can be used as a backfill in reinforced soil walls provided, it has geogrid layers of adequate stiffness and/or proper chimney drain configuration.

Unfortunately, the installation of vertical <b>sand</b> <b>drains</b> have become less economically viable due to the high costs and limited availability of good quality sand. Particle size distribution analyses done on samples of waste copper slag obtained from the Colombo dockyard revealed that its gradation was similar to that of sand, which meant that waste copper slag could potentially be used {{as a substitute}} for sand, provided that it did not adversely affect the hydraulic conductivity of the resulting mixture. In this study, constant head permeability tests were done on "sand-copper slag" mixes of varying proportions and it was shown that up to 50 % copper slag by weight could be added to sand without an appreciable loss in permeability. The performance of sand piles is dependent on strength and settlement characteristics of the sand. Hence, consolidation tests and direct shear tests were also carried out on the "sand-copper slag" mixes to explore how the mechanical properties of sand were affected by the copper slag...|$|R

40|$|Vacuum {{preloading}} is {{a ground}} improvement technique in which effective stress in soil is increased by reducing pore-water pressure. To understand the pore-water pressure, effective stress changes and deformation mechanism of soft soil subjected to underwater vacuum preloading, theoretical analysis, centrifuge modelling and numerical modelling were carried out. Analytical solutions of average degree of radial consolidation of soft clay subjected to vacuum preloading were developed. Well resistance, smear effect, vacuum loss, large lateral deformation and variation of soil stiffness and permeability are considered. Centrifuge tests of clay {{with a single}} vertical <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> and a vertical <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> group at a spacing of 8 D (D is drain diameter) were carried out. Subsurface displacement was measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV) and photogrammetry. Coupled axis-symmetric and coupled three-dimensional finite-element analyses were carried out to model consolidation behaviour of soft clay subjected to underwater vacuum preloading with a vertical drain group. Numerical experiments were carried out to investigate the behaviour of soft clay subjected to underwater vacuum preloading, on-land vacuum preloading and underwater surcharge preloading under idealized boundary conditions. Both measured and computed rates of consolidation with a vertical drain group were greater than those with a single vertical drain. Measured surface settlement near a vertical drain was 80 % of that away from the vertical drain. Measured maximum inward lateral displacement between vertical drains in centrifuge tests was about 5 % surface settlement. At the centre of a vertical drain group, final lateral earth pressure coefficient {{at the end of}} underwater and on-land vacuum preloading is greater than lateral earth pressure coefficient at rest, while that in underwater surcharge preloading is less than lateral earth pressure coefficient at rest. Computed inward lateral displacement {{at the edge of a}} treated zone is about 27 % of surface settlement by underwater and on-land vacuum preloading. The magnitude of computed lateral displacement by underwater or on-land vacuum preloading is 16 % of that by underwater surcharge preloading.

40|$|The {{consolidation}} theories considering instant load cannot fully {{reveal the}} consolidation mechanism {{of a stone}} column composite foundation used in the expressway embankments due to the time effect of loading; that is, the expressway embankments are often constructed in several stages for a long time.

40|$|The {{consolidation}} {{behavior of}} ground with vertical drains {{is known to}} be greatly affected by the finite permeability of the sand drains, also called the effect of well resistance. However, up to now, no analytical methods have been reported for evaluating this effect on the nonlinear consolidation behavior of vertical drains. In this paper, by considering the nonlinear compressibility and permeability of soil during consolidation, the effect of well resistance was incorporated into the derivation of the equations that govern the nonlinear consolidation of a vertical drain with coupled radial-vertical flow. In addition, the smear effect was considered by assuming three decay patterns for the radial permeability coefficients of the soil toward the <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> in the smeared zone. After obtaining the governing equations, a simplified analytical solution is derived for a general time-variable surcharge loading.

The validity of the solution is verified by reducing it to several special cases and comparing these to existing solutions.

Each subsystem of the reinforced fill-soil system is idealized by elastic membrane, Pasternak shear layer, Winkler springs and dashpots, as applicable. The suggested model incorporates {{various aspects of the}} behavior of the geosynthetic-reinforced granular fill-soft soil system such as horizontal stress induced in the granular fill, the compressibility of the granular fill, and the time-dependent behavior of the subgrade. The differential equations governing the settlement response of the beam resting on two layered reinforced foundation soil has been formulated by incorporating deformation compatibility conditions. The numerical solutions are obtained using Finite Element Method and results are presented in non-dimensional form. The parametric studies are carried out to enumerate the effects of parameters on the settlement response of the system. Results indicate that over a large number of various parameters under large deformation the proposed model evaluate the settlement of the system and horizontal displacement of membrane with reasonable accuracy. It is observed that compressibility, shear modulus and thickness of granular fill, pre-stressing and tension modulus of reinforcement have appreciable influence on the settlement of the system and horizontal displacement of membrane.

40|$|Granular drains {{are among}} the most {{effective}} tools for controlling the migration of contaminants. For long-term decommissioning in the mining industry, these drains might be subjected to clogging caused by fine particles of the surrounding soils. Fine particles become trapped in the granular drains, lowering permeability and reducing effectiveness. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize the effect of clogging by allowing particles to move more freely within the drains. The primary objectives of this research were to: i) 	Develop an understanding about the nature of clogging in <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> materials subjected to infiltration of fines; ii) Measure the impact {{of a wide range of}} fines on clogging of typical <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> materials; and iii) Modify an existing clogging model to more accurately predict permeability reduction. This study is a continuation of Bergerman’s (2011) study. The laboratory test program was built based on that study with some modifications to the test apparatus to gain better control over the output data. In addition, this study examined a wider range of variables, including particle size, clay activity and swelling capacity. The laboratory test program was conducted using three types of granular drainage soils: Coarse sand, Uniform sand and French drain sand, all under low gradient conditions. In order to simulate the transient effects of different fines on drainage sands, various suspensions of kaolinite, Battleford till and bentonite fines were used to infiltrate the sands. The test equipment used was similar to that of Bergerman’s (2011) study but with bigger inlet and outlet tubes and a fixed inflow elevation. These modifications were made with the goal of achieving a condition in which all head losses occurred only in the sand. Test results were recorded in terms of total heads versus time and were interpreted to determine the changes in head due to clogging of fine particles in the inflow. A normalization method was employed in the interpretation process to scale all test results to the same boundary conditions, which is important when comparing results from one test to another. The result of the test program showed that Coarse sand and Uniform sand were able to maintain flow longer than French drain sand due to their coarse nature. The positions of fines captured in these sand samples were also different. Fines were captured mostly at the effluent end in the Coarse sand column, at the middle of the Uniform sand column, and at the influent end of the French Drain sand column. Among the fines chosen, Bentonite was the most active clay with a plasticity index of 473 %, activity of 6. 5 and modified free swelling index of 58. 5. The presence of fully water-absorbed bentonite particles and flocculation caused fast clogging in the sand samples. A model, developed by Reddi et al. (2000), was chosen to simulate the test results in this study. The proposed modelling equations were applied with modifications in critical velocity of flow and the characteristic pore length of drain sand. These modifications were part of the calibration process, and they reflected the properties of materials used in this study. Most modelling results were in good agreement with the test results after calibration, except for Coarse and Uniform sands with bentonite. The unpredictable behavior of bentonite could be due to its great swelling potential and ability to create big flocculated particles. This model is therefore best used to simulate the behavior of clay suspensions with low-to-medium swelling capability. High-swelling clays would require additional effort in adjusting input parameters and perhaps modifying the model itself...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum {{preloading}} is {{a ground}} improvement technique in which effective stress of soil is increased by reducing pore water pressure. It {{can be further}} divided into on-land vacuum preloading and underwater vacuum preloading. To understand the consolidation behaviour of the soil subjected to on-land vacuum preloading and underwater vacuum preloading, theoretical analysis, field investigation, centrifuge modelling and numerical modelling were carried out. Analytical solutions of average reduction of pore water pressure in soft clay subjected to vacuum preloading were developed. Well resistance, smear effect and vacuum loss are considered in combined radial and vertical consolidation. Variation of soil stiffness and permeability, multi-stage loading procedure are considered in an incremental form. Based on constant coefficient of consolidation, {{it is found that}} average degree of consolidation is slightly larger in the presence of vacuum loss than that without vacuum loss (one-way drainage). It is also found that radial consolidation is significant only if the drain spacing ratio is less than threshold n value, which is 7 - 10 for large diameter drain (e. g., D = 0. 5 m) or 20 - 30 for small diameter drain (e. g., D = 0. 1 m). Observations obtained from field on-land vacuum preloading and centrifuge model tests on underwater vacuum preloading show that the pore water pressure reduces to a suction line with total vertical stress nearly unchanged. The principle of underwater vacuum preloading {{is similar to that of}} on-land vacuum preloading with little difference near the edge of treated zone. The increase in vertical effective stress is equal to reduction of pore water pressure for saturated soil, but the increase in horizontal effective stress varies with locations and generally less than that increase in vertical effective stress. The final coefficient of earth pressure in the treated zone ranged from K 0 at the bottom of the treated soil layer to nearly unity near the ground surface at the edge of treated zone. The coefficient of earth pressure also varies across the treated area. Negligible lateral displacement was found at lower depths below ground surface or 2. 5 H (H thickness of soft soil or depth of vertical drain) away from the edge of treated zone. The water pressure on the membrane plays a positive role on the increase of vertical effective stress. The efficiency (increment of reduction of pore water pressure over increment of water pressure on membrane) is about 0. 8 in present centrifuge test with lateral seepage. In field observations, vacuum loss is negligible in a large treated area, whereas vacuum loss is significant in a small treated zone. Penetration depth of a membrane influences the settlement slightly, whereas its influence is reduced in presence of vertical drains. However, penetration depth of a membrane significantly affects lateral displacement. The inward lateral displacement induced by vacuum preloading when the membrane penetrates through the full depth of soil is 1. 25 times of that when penetration depth of a membrane into soil is negligible. The ratio of lateral displacement to vertical displacement is 0. 55 when the penetration depth of membrane into soil is negligible, and is 0. 70 when the membrane penetrates through the full depth of soil. The larger the drain penetration depth, the larger the settlement is developed, unless the vertical drain penetrates beyond the optimum penetration depth. For a given penetration depth of sand drains, settlement decreases with increasing drain spacing from 8 D to 1 H. Given a penetration depth, the largest settlement is developed with drain spacing 8 D when sand drains are used. It is found that the bottom upward seepage (vacuum loss) has a negligible influence on the consolidation when the drain spacing is less than 8 D. The optimum penetration ratio is about 0. 95 when drain spacing is less than 28 D and the permeability of <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> is larger than four orders of that of clay...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} interprets the {{monitoring}} information collected from Hays Creek Dam since its upgrade in 1994. The upgrade involved the retrofitting of a continuous 800 mm wide well graded <b>sand</b> chimney <b>drain</b> from abutment to abutment in the downstream {{edge of the}} clay core of the dam, using a revertible bio-ploymer. Since this upgrade, the safety and performance of this water supply dam has improved...|$|R
50|$|They grow in nutritionally {{poor soil}} including: clay, <b>sand,</b> well <b>drained,</b> alkaline, loam; they require full sun {{but not a}} lot of watering, with a {{moderate}} aerosol salt tolerance. They tolerate wind, air pollution, salt, heat, and drought. They grow moderately and are sometimes fast growers. They produce seeds that are blown away and get germinated and this might result in the growing of more trees next to the original one.|$|R
40|$|The Bangkok subsoil {{that forms}} {{part of the}} larger Chao Phraya Plain {{consists}} of a broad basin filled with sedimen-tary soil deposits that form alternate layers of sand, gravel and clay. The depth of the bedrock is still undetermined, but its level in the Bangkok area is known to vary between 400 m and 1800 m deep. The aquifer system beneath the city area is very complex, and the deep-well pumping from the aquifers over the last 50 years or so has caused substantial piezometric drawdown in the upper soft and highly compressible clay layer. In this paper, the influence of the piezometric drawdown on the performance of vertical drains with surcharge on the upper clay layer is examined. Instrumented test embankments were built and the performance of large-diameter <b>sand</b> <b>drains,</b> <b>sand</b> wicks and prefabricated vertical drains was examined. A novel interpretation technique was adopted to evaluate the settlements from pore pressure dissipation and to compare with those measured directly from settlement measurements.
