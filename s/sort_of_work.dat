25|$|Philip Sidney {{was central}} to Scott's {{conception}} of what poetry was and what it could achieve, and in the Model he cites Astrophel and Stella, the Arcadia and, of course, An Apology for Poetry. Gavin Alexander writes that The model of poesy {{is in many ways}} a commentary on The defence of poesy, adopting its basic theory, filling in its gaps, interrogating and weighing its sources, glossing and elaborating its difficulties. But it is also a very different <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> a much more ambitious and comprehensive exercise inspired by the Defence but not bounded or constrained by it' (p. liii).|$|E
25|$|Today, dog breeds {{are often}} {{categorized}} by the ancestral type and subtype {{from which the}} breed descended. In addition, dog breed groups, which kennel clubs use to organize breeds of dogs, are based on dog types such as hound or terrier. Some group categories cover more than one type; working dog refers to dogs that do some <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for humans, in contrast to companion dogs which are pets, although working dogs can also be companions, and companion dogs can do useful work. The terminology is unclear; see Working Group and Utility Group. Mixed-breed dogs can have any combination of working and companion functions and be of any type. Toy dogs are very small dogs of any type. See Toy Group. Ancient dog breeds are modern breeds genetically identified as descending from very old types of various kinds, and would fit into multiple categories.|$|E

500|$|Stanford's chamber music, {{which as}} Dibble notes even Shaw praised, has not entered the general repertoire, but is well crafted. Dibble singles out the Three Intermezzi for {{clarinet}} and piano (1879), the Serenade nonet (1905), and the Clarinet Sonata (1911) with its touching lament. Writing of the First String Quintet, Porte {{calls it a}} sonorous and warm-hearted <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> constructed on fairly classical lines, and notes that the character and construction are typical of the composer. Porte comments similarly on other chamber works, including the Second Piano Trio: [...] "This is a typical Stanfordian work. It is sonorously scored, classical in outlook, and contains many passages of an expressive and somewhat poetical freshness. There are no very special features to note, but the work is one that makes a useful and interesting item." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s, Norman Hastings {{built on}} Berry's {{hypothesis}} proposing Bury as the Ripper, and 100 {{years after the}} Ripper murders William Beadle and Dundee librarian Euan Macpherson published books and articles popularising Bury as a Ripper suspect. They highlighted that the canonical five Whitechapel murders ended in November 1888, which roughly coincided with Bury's departure from Whitechapel. There was graffiti at Bury's Dundee flat that implied that Jack the Ripper lived there, and Macpherson supposed this was written by Bury {{as a form of}} confession. William took Ellen's rings, and the Ripper is believed to have taken rings from victim Annie Chapman. Bury was persistently violent to his wife, threatened her with a knife, and cut open her abdomen after death in a manner not dissimilar to the Whitechapel murderer. In a conversation with her neighbours, Marjory Smith, who ran the shop above the Burys' Prince's Street flat in Dundee, asked them [...] "What <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> was this you Whitechapel folk have been about, letting Jack the Ripper kill so many people?" [...] Bury did not answer her, but Ellen replied [...] "Jack the Ripper is quiet now." [...] She reportedly told another neighbour, [...] "Jack the Ripper is taking a rest." [...] Beadle and Macpherson argued that Ellen's comments might indicate that she had knowledge of the Ripper's whereabouts.|$|E
500|$|Kurt's {{scenes with}} Blaine {{and with his}} father evoked very {{divergent}} opinions from reviewers. Canning made mention of [...] "a great conversation between Blaine and Kurt that felt very real for kids in this situation" [...] and noted he was [...] "glad it wasn't an easy talk for either of them". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson agreed, and said of their [...] "debate over the existence of bisexuality" [...] that [...] "it was refreshing to see Glee portray a conversation like it really goes down in reality. It’s also good to see them not treat Kurt like such a saint all the time." [...] Semigran wrote that Kurt showed [...] "an unflattering side of himself", and Gonzalez stated that she [...] "was completely on Blaine's side here": Kurt [...] "wasn't fair" [...] and [...] "was sort of unlikable" [...] for once, though she did add that [...] "he's allowed to be flawed". Blaine's [...] "sudden confusion over his sexual orientation" [...] was deemed a [...] "false note" [...] by Reiter, who called his [...] "overwrought speech" [...] at the Lima Bean [...] "off-key". Harper was unhappy that [...] "major plot points like a gay character thinking he might be bi or straight get instigated, sorted out and wrapped up within an hour", and said {{she thought it was}} [...] "hurtful" [...] for Blaine to [...] "accept a date with Kurt's friend" [...] after he and Kurt had [...] "agreed to <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on a potential relationship between the two of them" [...] in the [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] episode.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Slant magazine, Keith Uhlich {{gave the}} season an overall rating of three-and-a-half stars out of five, {{finding that the}} {{appointment}} of Morgan and Wong was [...] "an inspired choice that led to, arguably, the finest episodic run ever produced under [...] Carter's Ten-Thirteen Productions banner". Uhlich found that the season was torn between episodes remaining true to the Carter-led first season's [...] "serial killer of the week" [...] format and make-it-up-as-you-go-along approach to storytelling", and Morgan and Wong's attempt to introduce a continuous story arc which lent a [...] "sealed-off feel" [...] to the season, finding that the latter approach lead to a [...] "compulsively watchable" [...] but largely dated end result. DVD Talk's Bill Gibron rated the season overall four-and-a-half stars out of five, finding that the new thematic direction was [...] "right on the money". Gibron felt that the season [...] "was truly ahead of its time. It predates and predicts such fashionable fads as The Da Vinci Code, the omens of terrorist evil and the slow erosion of the citizenry's faith in the Federal Government". Todd VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, wrote that [...] "the second season of Millennium is some <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> of weird genius". VanDerWerff added that the season [...] "moves like a series with a new purpose, with {{a new sense of}} meaning. Morgan and Wong start tossing ideas at the wall with a thrilling abandon, almost as if they were pretty sure they’d never work in Hollywood again".|$|E
500|$|In Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, Clarke infuses her dry wit with prosaic quaintness. For example, {{the narrator}} notes: [...] "It has been remarked (by a lady {{infinitely}} cleverer {{than the present}} author) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry. Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne! No young lady ever had such advantages before: for she died upon the Tuesday, was raised {{to life in the}} early hours of Wednesday morning, and was married upon the Thursday; which some people thought too much excitement for one week." [...] As Michel Faber explains in his review for The Guardian, [...] "here we have all the defining features of Clarke's style simultaneously: the archly Austenesque tone, the somewhat overdone quaintness ("upon the Tuesday"), the winningly matter-of-fact use of the supernatural, and drollness to spare." [...] Gregory Maguire notes in The New York Times that Clarke even gently ridicules the genre of the novel itself: [...] " [...] picks up a book and begins to read...but he is not attending to what he reads and he has got to Page 22 before he discovers it is a novel– the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> which above all others he most despises– and he puts it down in disgust." [...] Elsewhere, the narrator remarks, [...] "Dear Emma does not waste her energies upon novels like other young women." [...] The narrator's identity has been a topic of discussion, with Clarke declaring that said narrator is female and omniscient rather than a future scholar from within the real storyline as some had suggested.|$|E

2500|$|I {{remember}} that your brother Hugh {{did something to}} dissuade me from tackling Manxland in any <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> He did not think the readers of novels would find the island at all interesting, and {{he was sure that}} the local atmosphere was not such as would attract them. I thought over this a good deal, and decided, I must say, against your brother's judgment. [...] In the first place, the island has excellent atmosphere. It has the sea, a fine coast on the west, fine moorland above; it has traditions, folk-talk, folk-lore, a ballad literature, and no end of superstition – and all these are very much its own.|$|E
2500|$|Nozomi Momoi {{was born}} in Tokyo on September 23, 1978. She {{attended}} junior high school in Nagano Prefecture, and remained in touch with friends there, visiting them on vacation, {{for the rest of}} her life. Before beginning work in the AV field, Nozomi worked in what she called [...] "a very normal job." [...] Describing her daily routine at this time, she said, [...] "I used to wake up at 5:30 in the morning to get ready for work and I didn't have time to put on make-up or do my hair... It was the type of job where I was alone most of the time so I didn't bother with it." [...] She wanted a different lifestyle, and to make more money, but she was unable to decide what <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> she wanted to do. She was in this frame of mind when she was scouted by a representative of the AV industry in Tokyo's Shinjuku neighborhood.|$|E
2500|$|Besides {{the more}} {{mechanical}} <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> such as mosaic patterns and architectural decoration, they also produced mosaic pictures and sculpture {{of very high}} merit, especially the recumbent effigies, with angels standing at the head and foot, in the tombs of Aracoeli, S. Maria Maggiore and elsewhere. One of their finest works is in S. Cesareo; this is a marble altar richly decorated with mosaic in sculptured panels, and (below) two angels drawing back a curtain (all in marble) so as to expose the open grating of the confessio. The magnificent cloisters of S. Paolo fuori le Mura, built about 1285 by Giovanni, {{the youngest of the}} Cosmati, {{are one of the most}} beautiful works of this school. The baldacchino of the same basilica is a signed work of the Florentine Arnolfo di Cambio, 1285, cum suo socio Petro, probably a pupil of the Cosmati. Other works of Arnolfo, such as the [...] at Orvieto, show an intimate artistic alliance between him and the Cosmati. The equally magnificent cloisters of the Lateran, of about the same date, are very similar in design; both these triumphs of the sculptor-architects and mosaicists work have slender marble columns, twisted or straight, richly inlaid with bands of glass mosaic in delicate and brilliant patterns. In the crypt at Anagni is the largest section of undisturbed Cosmatesque flooring.|$|E
