30|$|Johnson et al. {{demonstrated}} that modern cortical <b>suspension</b> <b>devices</b> {{are capable of}} withstanding ultimate forces of 784 – 2231  N (Johnson et al., 2015). These forces are much greater than those tolerated by the tissue grafts in our study, {{which suggests that the}} suture by which the graft is secured, or to the fixation device is the weakest component of the graft-link construct. This extrapolation is complicated by a variety of factors including dynamic in vivo force vectors and loads as well as by supplemental fixation techniques such as cortical <b>suspension</b> <b>devices</b> used in combination with an interference screw. Nevertheless, it is essential to identify and minimize those components which are susceptible to rupture or failure.|$|R

40|$|International audienceFemale pelvic {{disorders}} {{have a large}} social impact, {{the diagnosis}} of which relies on a key indication: pelvic mobility. The normal mobility is present in a healthy patient, meanwhile the hypermobility can {{be a sign of}} female pelvic prolapse and the hypomobility for endometriosis. The evaluation of pelvic mobility is based on medical image analysis. However, the latter does not provide precise values of these indicators directly. Moreover, <b>suspension</b> <b>devices</b> {{play an important role in}} pelvic organ function, but can hardly be observed on medical images. Our objective is to propose an image-based analysis tool for the quantitative evaluation of pelvic mobility and the shear strain which has an impact on <b>suspension</b> <b>devices.</b> Hence, this paper introduces a such tool based on an e cient and semi-automatic motion tracking of multiple pelvic organs: the bladder, vagina and rectum presented in dynamic magnetic resonance imaging sequences. The method was validated on prototypical images and applied to di↵erent mobility cases. The computed displacement and shear strain fields provide important information on the quality of <b>suspension</b> <b>devices</b> between organs for a fine diagnosis in the clinical context, for example the early diagnosis of female pelvic prolapse and the localization of possible lesion areas before surgery. Meanwhile, the predicted mobility can be used to compare with the finite element model for numerical simulation...|$|R
30|$|Among extracortical {{fixation}} buttons, fixed-loop and adjustable-loop <b>suspension</b> <b>devices</b> are available. In {{an effort}} to clinically investigate the suggestion that adjustable-loop graft suspension constructs in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may loosen after deployment, (Boyle et al., 2015) reported the two-year outcomes of their consecutive single-surgeon series of 188 patients with primary ACL reconstruction using hamstrings autografts. Seventy-three patients received adjustable-loop (TightRope RT, Arthrex Inc., Naples, FL) and 115 received fixed-loop (RetroButton, Arthrex Inc., Naples, FL) femoral cortical suspension. The authors found {{no significant difference between}} the two groups in KT- 1000 testing at all time-points up to two years of follow-up. The rates of graft failure were similar too at 10 % vs. 11 %, respectively (Boyle et al., 2015).

30|$|As an alternative, extracortical graft {{fixation}} devices can be utilized.

Adjustable-loop devices offer the opportunity of retensioning the graft while already placed in the tunnel.

In contrast, the medallion for the Order of the State has the trident of Prince Volodymyr of Kiev (St. Vladimir) placed {{on top of a}} wreath of oak leaves.

5000|$|A coilover is an {{automobile}} <b>suspension</b> <b>device.</b> [...] "Coilover" [...] {{is short for}} [...] "coil spring over shock". It consists of a shock absorber with a coil spring encircling it. The shock absorber and spring are assembled as a unit prior to installation, and are replaced as a unit when the shock absorber has leaked. This provides damping without torsional loads. Some coilovers allow adjustment of ride height and preload, using a simple threaded spring perch similar to a nut. More advanced adjustable coilover systems use a threaded shock body, along with an adjustable lower mount for ride height adjustment, while an adjustment knob is used to adjust damping. Stiffness is changed by switching the spring for one with a different spring rate.|$|E

Among the options for repairs with synthetic devices is anatomic reconstruction with a double tunnel in the clavicle {{as well as in}} the coracoid [5]. This technique allows the conoid and trapezoid ligaments to be emulated, and has shown biomechanical advantages [12], but there is also an increased risk of fracture of the clavicle during the construction of two tunnels and an increase in technical difficulty [5]. On the other hand, the isometric approach seeks to restore the anatomy of the conoid and trapezoid ligaments by using a single anchoring stitch in the coracoid at the midway point of the insertion of both ligaments.|$|R
