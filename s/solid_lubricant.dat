40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} {{a review of}} <b>solid</b> <b>lubricants</b> application in different machining processes such as grinding, milling, drilling, and turning. Of late, several reasons {{have led to the}} increased usage of <b>solid</b> <b>lubricants</b> in machining. The heat generated in the cutting zone dur-ing machining is critical in deciding the workpiece quality. Although cutting fluids are widely employed to carry away the heat in machining, their usage poses threat to ecology and the health of workers. Hence, there arises a need to identify eco-friendly and user-friendly alternatives to conventional cutting fluids. Modern tribology has facilitated the use of <b>solid</b> <b>lubricants</b> as an alter-native to cutting fluids in machining. Graphite, calcium fluoride, molybdenum disulphide, and boric acid are the general <b>solid</b> <b>lubricants</b> used in machining. Process performance is improved with the application of <b>solid</b> <b>lubricants</b> in machining. By reducing coefficient of friction, cutting forces and tool wear are reduced in machining with <b>solid</b> <b>lubricants.</b> Reduction in cutting forces results in lower specific energy requirement and thus reduces production cost. Surface quality of the machined workpiece is also improved with <b>solid</b> <b>lubricants...</b>|$|R

The widespread use of <b>solid</b> <b>lubricants</b> did not occur until about 1947.

40|$|The main {{research}} {{focus of}} this thesis is {{on the development of}} the next generation of <b>solid</b> <b>lubricants</b> for high temperature forming of steel. These lubricants are based on ceramic nanoparticles which are more resistant to temperature and oxidation than traditional lubricants. Nowadays, the most common products are aqueous suspensions of graphite, molybdenum disulfide or polytetrafluoroethylene (TeflonTM). Nevertheless, some problems are associated to their use, for instance pitting corrosion on the steel surface caused by partial decomposition of the lubricants at high temperature, and, more in general, a dirty working environment. Advanced inorganic <b>solid</b> <b>lubricants</b> were developed to overcome these problems. The performance of <b>solid</b> <b>lubricants</b> in forging processes is correlated with their plastic behavior. This means that when a force is applied, needed to shape the metal piece, the lubricants should absorb part of the force, transforming it into a physical deformation or a chemical change. The role of the lubricant is to decrease the necessary forces to form the metal pieces, protection of the metal surface, and/or participation in the process of releasing the piece from the mold. It is straightforward to think that the plasticity (softness) of <b>solid</b> <b>lubricants</b> originates from naturally soft networks. At first glance, a common lubrication mechanism can be inferred from the mechanical behavior of the different materials. The plastic deformability of the networks seems to be connected to the ease of dislocation propagation in the network. In this thesis, this property was explored by studying three different classes of materials: (1) soft structured networks, i. e. layered oxides; (2) soft atomic networks, i. e. bismuth metal and (3) soft amorphous networks, i. e. organosilicas. Control over the synthesis and chemical modification is an important factor to obtain materials that can be part of the new generation of <b>solid</b> <b>lubricants.</b> Some of the tested materials were able to outperform graphite in terms of a decrease of friction force. The results of this research are the input for the achievement of the next generation of <b>solid</b> <b>lubricants</b> for high temperature applications...|$|R
