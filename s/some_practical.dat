In the season finale, after the wedding ceremony presided over by Larry, he is happy but worries about disconnecting with Don and offers to have the garage renovated into a guest house for his father. He toasts his friends and family and amazes at the prospect of staying in England with his wife.|$|E

He hit a century in each innings against Queensland in their inaugural Sheffield Shield match in 192627. The following season he registered the highest score of his career, 315 not out in 388minutes versus Queensland at the SCG. Bradman wrote of this performance, [...] "...although they say Victor Trumper was even more beautiful to watch, it is hard to conceive more graceful batting than our skipper produced on that occasion." [...] Kippax ended the season with 926runs at an average of 84.18.|$|E

In addition, Rothstein notes the space opera teachings also provide fundamental justifications for <b>some</b> <b>practical</b> aspects of Scientology, including the rejection of psychiatry and the formation of the Sea Org. He sees space opera as similar to most types of mythology, involving superhuman beings in the far distant past. Willms states the mythology of Scientology differs from many other religions because it focuses on material beings; but argues the Xenu myth is a religious narrative, although the Church of Scientology has never used this claim in their efforts to be recognized as a religion.|$|E

She was particularly interested by John Symonds' book The Great Beast, which was a biography of the occultist Aleister Crowley, who had founded the religion of Thelema in 1904, and following this she avidly read a copy of Crowley's Magick in Theory and Practice which she found in a local library.

These types of LARPs exist with boffer weapons, but they are more commonly seen with real weapons and armor. This system follows variations of the Limb Loss System with the primary difference being realism. In <b>some</b> <b>practical</b> LARPs actions such as kicking another player's shield is authorize, as seen in the LARP Dagohir. Practical systems that involve real weapons and armor put emphasis on realism, specifically historic realism which is what the [...] strives to achieve. The SCA is techinally an educational group and not a LARP, however, they are the most widely known group that utilizes the Practical system of combat. On the RP side of things, Practical LARPs differ from Limb Loss LARPs because of the interaction that takes place between combat. Generally, but not always, Practical LARPs do not role play in between fights and if they do, they usually take on the role of a historical figure rather than a created character.|$|E
