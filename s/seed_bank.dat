5|$|Like {{many plants}} in Australia's southwest, Banksia aculeata {{is adapted to}} an {{environment}} in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy <b>seed</b> <b>bank,</b> thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia aculeata is killed by fire because it possesses neither thick protective bark nor a lignotuber to reshoot from. It is serotinous—it accumulates a canopy <b>seed</b> <b>bank</b> that is released only in response to fire—so populations typically recover rapidly after a fire, but this strategy makes it dependent on a suitable fire regime. Plants take three to four years to reach flowering after a bushfire.|$|E
5|$|A {{declared}} vulnerable species, {{it occurs}} in two disjunct populations on granite outcrops along the south coast of Western Australia, with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole, and is threatened by dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and aerial canker (Zythiostroma). B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate from seed afterwards. Populations take over a decade to produce seed and fire intervals of greater than twenty years are needed to allow the canopy <b>seed</b> <b>bank</b> to accumulate.|$|E
5|$|Banksia menziesii regenerates after bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} woody lignotuber, or from epicormic buds on the trunk. It is {{generally}} only weakly serotinous {{in the southern}} part of its range, that is, it lacks a canopy <b>seed</b> <b>bank</b> as follicles on old flower spikes in the canopy release their seed after two years, but populations retain more seed as populations move north. Lower canopies and drier climates predispose to hotter fires that are more likely to kill plants and effect seed release, and thus facilitate seedling recruitment.|$|E
40|$|In Nepal, {{community}} <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> have a {{long and}} rich history. Supported in particular {{by a number of}} non-government organizations and more recently, also by government agencies, they can be found across the country from the lowland terai to the high hill areas and from east to west. The latest count puts the number of active community <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> at 115. These proceedings present the contributions of community <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> to the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biodiversity. The various contributions discuss conceptual, practical and policy issues concerning the establishment and management of community <b>seed</b> <b>banks.</b> Lessons learned from the experiences in Nepal will be useful for community <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> globally...|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} soil <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> in 102 plots {{within a}} 110000 ha Arizona Pinus ponderosa landscape, determined seed-bank responses to fire cues and tree canopy types (open or densely treed patches), compared seed-bank composition among ecosystem types, and assessed {{the utility of}} <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> for ecological restoration. Liquid smoke was associated with increased community-level emergence from <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> in greenhouse experiments, whereas heating to 100 °C had minimal effect and charred P. ponderosa wood decreased emergence. We detected 103 species in seed-bank samples and 280 species in aboveground vegetation. Erigeron divergens was the commonest seed-bank species; {{with the exception of}} Gnaphalium exilifolium, species detected in <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> also occurred above ground. Although a dry, sandy-textured black-cinder ecosystem exhibited the greatest seed density, seed-bank composition was more ecosystem-specific than was seed density. Native graminoids (e. g., Carex geophila and Muhlenbergia montana) were common in <b>seed</b> <b>banks,</b> whereas perennial forbs were sparse, particularly under dense tree canopies. Our results suggest that (i) smoke may increase emergence from <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> in these forests, (ii) <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> can assist establishment of major graminoids but not forbs during ecological restoration, and (iii) seed-bank composition is partly ecosystem-specific across the landscap...|$|R
40|$|Although community-level seed-saving {{initiatives}} have existed {{in many countries}} around the world for about 30 years, they have rarely been the subject of systematic scientific enquiry. Based on a combination of a literature review and field research, we present a novel comprehensive conceptual framework that focuses on the multiple functions and services provided by community-based seed-saving efforts, in particular community <b>seed</b> <b>banks.</b> This framework is output oriented and complements an input oriented typology of community <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> presented in 1997. The framework identifies three core functions: conserving genetic resources; enhancing access to and availability of diverse local crops; and ensuring seed and food sovereignty. The framework can be used for analysis of existing seed-saving initiatives and serve as a guide for the establishment of new community <b>seed</b> <b>banks.</b> In addition, it can inform the development or revision of national policies or strategies to support community <b>seed</b> <b>banks.</b> The framework’s utility is illustrated by three case studies of community <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> in Bangladesh, Guatemala and Nepal...|$|R
5|$|Lambertia formosa regenerates after bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} woody lignotuber, {{but is also}} {{serotinous}} in {{that it has a}} <b>seed</b> <b>bank</b> held in its canopy to be released after fire. The number of flowers produced by plants growing back from fire peaks two or three years afterwards. A field study in Brisbane Water National Park north of Sydney found that plants that had experienced two short (less than seven-year) intervals between bushfires had reduced reproductive output as measured by lower numbers of follicles, compared with plants in areas which had had no or one short inter-fire interval. Plants can live for over 60 years.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.attenuata {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy <b>seed</b> <b>bank,</b> thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Bearing epicormic buds and a lignotuber, B.attenuata is one of the latter group, with follicles that may open spontaneously or by fire.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.epica has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. The species lacks a lignotuber, so {{is thought to be}} killed by fire. Like most Banksia species, however, it is adapted to release its aerial <b>seed</b> <b>bank</b> following a bushfire, so populations regenerate rapidly. It is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
50|$|Pyrogenic {{flowering}} is the fire-stimulated {{flowering of}} plants in heathland and other fire-prone habitats. It {{is associated with}} species which have transient <b>seed</b> <b>banks,</b> as opposed to canopy or persistent soil <b>seed</b> <b>banks.</b> These species are mostly monocots, {{but it is also}} observed in several species of woody dicots.|$|R
40|$|According to our {{hypothesis}} we found more {{seeds in the}} southern part of the gradient. The northern <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> (Rodillo and Cisne) are characterized by their low number of seeds and low species richness, according with their more extreme aridity. The central and southern <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> have more than two times higher number and species richness than the northern ones. Southern <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> (Lagunillas, Romeral and Punta Choros) contain more exotics&#x 2019; seeds; meanwhile central <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> (Pajonales, Carrizal Bajo and Los Bronces) have less seeds, and less exotics&#x 2019; seeds. These results suggest that the increased seed number in the southern portion of the gradient could be due to an increased number of exotic species, rather than an increased diversity of native annuals. More viable and larger seeds were found in the southern sites, meanwhile, smaller seeds were found to the north indicating the use of a cautious opportunism strategy by these species. This is the first report on <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> composition of this Atacama Desert area...|$|R
40|$|Aerial <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> are {{potentially}} {{the main source}} of sexual recruitment for woody wetland plants. Whilst the importance of soil <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> for the persistence and recruitment of wetland plants has been examined in many studies, the role of aerial <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> has been largely neglected. We used seed traps and the seedling emergence technique to quantify the seed rain from aerial <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> of the Swamp Paperbark Melaleuca ericifolia Sm. (Myrtaceae) in Dowd Morass, a Ramsar-listed, brackish-water wetland in south-eastern Australia. Nine plant species germinated from material collected in seed traps over 2004 – 2005, but emergents were dominated (80 – 97 %) by M. ericifolia. The mean number of M. ericifolia emergents ranged from < 1 to < 100 seedlings m− 2 day− 1, and showed a peak in the summer–autumn period. Regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation (r 2 = 0. 738) between the number of M. ericifolia emergents and water depth. Water depth and salinity were negatively correlated (r 2 = 0. 819), and increases in the number of M. ericifolia emergents as water levels fell were also associated with high salinities. Increasing air temperature and vapour pressure deficit also stimulated seed release during periods of drying. This study {{is one of the first}} to demonstrate the importance of aerial <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> for sexual recruitment in woody wetland plants and the release of seed in relation to environmental factors. Aerial <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> warrant consideration alongside soil <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> for the establishment and long-term survival of woody plants in wetlands...|$|R
5|$|Neither {{the species}} nor the sites have any current legal protection, {{and it could}} be under {{significant}} threat of survival in the long term from inappropriate gardening or care. Seed samples of the Radyr hawkweed have been provided to the Millennium <b>Seed</b> <b>Bank,</b> the international conservation project coordinated by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and plants are being carefully cultivated. The plant normally flowers between May and early July and Radyr residents are urged by botanists to be on the look out for further examples of the endangered species while walking in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in dry sclerophyll forest on sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soil. It has adapted to a fire-prone environment; plants lost in bushfires can {{regenerate}} through a ground-stored <b>seed</b> <b>bank.</b> Seedlings mostly germinate {{within two years}} of fires. Several species of native bee of the genus Leioproctus pollinate the flowers. Swamp wallabies are a main consumer of its fruit, and the seeds are spread in wallaby faeces. Its lifespan ranges from 25 to 60 years, though difficulties in propagation have seen low cultivation rates.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} {{the rise of a}} number of {{scientific}} establishments. The Agricultural University of Norway had established a primitive <b>seed</b> <b>bank</b> in 1984. The University Centre in Svalbard opened on 6 September 1993 and had 30 students in its inaugural semester. Telenor Mobil established GSM coverage in 1995, and in 2004 the Svalbard Undersea Cable System opened, providing fiber optic cable connection to the mainland. The European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) opened a radar in 1996, followed by Svalbard Satellite Station in 1999 and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in 2008.|$|E
40|$|In Mindanao, {{the southernmost}} island of Philippines, {{participatory}} plant breeding and participatory varietal selection projects were established. Centre-based and community-based <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> were established to support community efforts to systematically collect, conserve, develop and utilize plant genetic resources. The community <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> give farmers {{access to and}} control over seeds and strengthen local seed supply systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} trends in the composition of <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> due to geographic location and duration of drainage and cultivation and to estimate the role of relict <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> in restorations.

5|$|B. coccinea {{is killed}} by fire and regenerates {{afterwards}} from seed released from burnt follicles. It has is {{some degree of}} serotiny, that is, it has an aerial <b>seed</b> <b>bank</b> in its canopy {{in the form of}} the follicles of the old flower spikes. However, numbers of seed are less than other co-occurring species of banksia on the southern plains and peak several years after a fire. Unusually for banksias, B. coccinea can release seed with resulting seedlings growing in the absence of a bushfire trigger. Plants flower and fruit three years after germination and are shorter-lived than other banksias, appearing in poor health or dying before 20 years of age. They hence appear to be suited to fire intervals of less than 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of Banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous populations. In both cases, plants are adapted to release their aerial <b>seed</b> <b>bank</b> {{following}} a bushfire, ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground; however the possession of a lignotuber makes plants much less reliant on fire regime for population maintenance and regeneration, as maternal plants are not killed by bushfire, but resprout from below ground level. Lignotuberous plants generally occur among the north-eastern populations, in the vicinity of Woodanilling. An investigation into the biogeography of these plants failed to find any vegetative, climatic or other environmental factors associated with the possession of a lignotuber.|$|E
5|$|It is a hairy {{biennial}} {{plant that}} can grow to 2 m tall or more. Its small, yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows {{from a large}} rosette of leaves. It grows {{in a wide variety}} of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the soil <b>seed</b> <b>bank.</b> It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, but it rarely becomes aggressively invasive, since its seeds require open ground to germinate. It is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it is not a very competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> have become highly {{relevant}} {{in the field of}} agriculture and alimentation. Although these institutions were under-considered by social sciences, <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> are key institutions related to the use and conservation of natural resources. In this paper they are analyzed from a qualitative approach, that combines both deeply interviews with <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> referents in Argentina -a country with an economy fundamentally based on agriculture-, and documentation sources, among others. We will investigate how the main legal norms and international agreements were developed, their impact on Argentina and how plant genetic resources conservation mechanisms have evolved in the country, with the purpose of analyzing how a normative and institutional frame over plant genetic resources was shaped in Argentina...|$|R
40|$|Management {{of exotic}} {{plants that are}} annuals entails {{understanding}} and managing their soil <b>seed</b> <b>banks.</b> We completed {{a study of the}} influences of heat and liquid smoke on red brome (Bromus rubens) soil <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> collected from Red Rock Canyon in southern Nevada as part of a collaborative fire effects monitoring effort with Bureau of Land Management - Las Vegas. We collected the samples from the 2005 Loop Fire, where we observed in a monitoring field study that exotic grasses such as red brome were relatively sparse in the first 2 - 3 years (which were during a dry period) following the fire. Based on these observations, we were interested in assessing whether the direct exposure to heat and smoke during fire may influence brome’s <b>seed</b> <b>banks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Forest {{fragmentation}} is {{prevalent in}} regions with high human population density, {{but also with}} high biological diversity, such as southwestern China. Predicting potential changes in species composition in native forest ecosystems resulting from forest fragmentation is an important approach in assessing forest ecosystems and sustainable management of forests. The term nonconstituent species is proposed for plant species that occur in a natural landscape but are not native to it. We hypothesized that fragmentation of continuous forests significantly increases both the richness {{and the size of}} soil <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> of nonconstituent species. To test our hypothesis we compared soil <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> in three small fragments and one large tract of subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in Yunnan Province, southwestern China. In total, 249 species were identified in all soil samples from the four sites. Nonconstituent species represented 36. 4 %- 61. 5 % of the total taxa and 33. 8 %- 59. 6 % of total germinants from soil samples in the three forest fragments, but only 3. 7 %- 7. 9 % of total taxa and 7. 5 %- 9. 4 % of total germinants from soil samples in the continuous forest tract. Both richness and size of soil <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> of nonconstituent species were greater under forest fragments than under continuous forest. A majority of nonconstituent species were native weeds and annual herbs with wind-dispersed seeds; most were present in soil <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> but not in aboveground vegetation. We suggest that nonconstituent species in soil <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> could be used as an indicator species group for assessing human disturbance. If so, the richness and size of soil <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> of nonconstituent species could {{play an important role in}} quantifying disturbance in forests. © 2006 NRC...|$|R
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in Australia's southwest, Banksia sceptrum {{is adapted to}} an {{environment}} in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy <b>seed</b> <b>bank,</b> thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia sceptrum is a reseeder—killed by bushfire and regenerating by seed. The follicles on the old flower spikes remain closed until burnt by fire, after which they open and release the seed. New plants take three to five years to flower again. If bushfires are too frequent—occurring less than four years apart—they risk eradicating local populations of reseeders.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.oligantha {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy <b>seed</b> <b>bank,</b> thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.oligantha is a reseeder; it has thin bark, and lacks a lignotuber, so it is killed by fire. However, the species is weakly serotinous: fire triggers seed release, yet seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, Banksia caleyi {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy <b>seed</b> <b>bank,</b> thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.caleyi belongs to the reseeder group. In the wild, seedlings take at least three to four years to reach flowering after bushfire. Non-patchy fires occurring at intervals of less than seven years may wipe out local populations of reseeders.|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} ex situ {{conservation}} facilities has grown dramatically in recent years, {{and they have}} become increasingly integrated under national and regional conservation initiatives. However, little information is available {{about the extent to}} which plant species are appropriately represented in ex situ collections. This paper assesses whether seed/spore collections stored in European <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> cover or not, and to what extent, the species currently threatened with extinction in the wild. Although a substantial amount of the European flora (ca. 70 %) is currently stored in <b>seed</b> <b>banks,</b> we highlight the relatively poor representation of threatened species: only 27 % of the taxa listed on the European threatened plant list and 44 % of the taxa listed in Annex II of the EU Habitat Directive are stored in European <b>seed</b> <b>banks.</b> Some taxonomical groups most at risk, e. g. Pteridophytes and Orchidaceae, are also under-represented in European <b>seed</b> <b>banks.</b> By examining the number of accessions per species and the number of seeds per accession, this study also gave some insight on how well species are conserved, considering that these two variables are surrogates for genetic diversity. We have highlighted that at least two thirds of the threatened species stored in European <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> likely suffer from too low genetic diversity in the collections. These analyses were essential to identify those collections and additionally the standards needed to maximize the usefulness of future collections. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Over three decades, {{a number}} of {{international}} and national organizations have provided {{technical and financial support}} to community <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> around the world. Only a few of these organizations have developed and published a practical guide about how they have offered this support. This handbook fills the gap and advances research and capacity development regarding community <b>seed</b> <b>banks.</b> The handbook is organized as a guide for facilitators — people who work in the field with farmers and their organizations on issues of seed conservation and sustainable use. The publication Community seed banks: origins, evolution, and prospects edited by Ronnie Vernooy, Pitambar Shrestha, and Bhuwon Sthapit (Vernooy et al. 2015), which offers a global overview of diverse community <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> around the world, provided the foundation for the content of this handbook. Parts of that publication have been updated and integrated into the handbook...|$|R
30|$|The Orchidaceae is {{probably}} the largest family of flowering plants with more than 27, 000 species (Zotz 2013) and is the most diverse plant group (Swarts and Dixon 2009), {{with high levels of}} ecological specialisation for pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi (Bailarote et al. 2012). The Itremo region in the Central Highlands of Madagascar is a micro-hotspot for orchids (Yokoya et al. 2015). The taxa we studied were from granite and quartz outcrops, and montane grassland. <b>Seed</b> <b>banking</b> is one of the cornerstones of ex situ biodiversity conservation. The majority of epiphytic orchids are desiccation tolerant, and can be stored at −[*] 20  °C in <b>seed</b> <b>banks</b> (Seaton et al. 2010). According to Merritt et al. (2014) seed life span depends on seed traits, along with the biotic and abiotic components of their environment. Desiccation tolerance is common in most orchids, but longevity in storage using conventional <b>seed</b> <b>banking</b> is poor (Li and Pritchard 2009). Therefore, cryopreservation offers a viable long-term seed storage option (Popova et al. 2016).|$|R
5|$|The seeds {{maintain}} their germinative powers for decades, up {{to a hundred}} years, according to some studies. Because of this, and because the plant is an extremely prolific seed bearer (each plant produces hundreds of capsules, each containing up to 700+ seeds, with a total up to 180,000 or 240,000 seeds), it remains in the soil <b>seed</b> <b>bank</b> for extended periods of time, and can sprout from apparently bare ground, or shortly after forest fires long after previous plants have died. Its population pattern typically consists of an ephemeral adult population followed by {{a long period of}} dormancy as seeds. Great mullein rarely establishes on new grounds without human intervention because its seeds do not disperse very far. Seed dispersion requires the stem to be moved by wind or animal movement; 75% of the seeds fall within 1 m of the parent plant, and 93% fall within 5 m.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many Banksia species, B.telmatiaea lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, it is adapted to release its aerial <b>seed</b> <b>bank</b> {{following}} a bushfire, and so regenerates rapidly. This behaviour, known as serotiny, makes B.telmatiaea dependent upon a suitable fire regime for successful regeneration; indeed, excessive fire frequency {{may be one reason}} why B.telmatiaea does not occur further south, despite suitable habitat throughout southwest Australia. Unlike most serotinous Banksia species, the seeds of B.telmatiaea are not released immediately after the passage of a bushfire. The follicles open straight away, but at first the seeds are blocked from falling out by the winged seed separator. If moistened, these wings close up, and as they dry they open out again, levering the seeds out of position, making it possible for them to fall. This adaptation ensures that seeds are released only after the first rains following a bushfire.|$|E
5|$|Banksia oblongifolia {{plants can}} live {{for more than}} 60 years. They respond to bushfire by resprouting from buds located on the large woody lignotuber. Larger lignotubers have the {{greatest}} number of buds, although buds are more densely spaced on smaller lignotubers. A 1988 field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that shoots grow longer after fire, particularly one within the previous four years, and that new buds grow within six months after a fire. These shoots are able to grow, flower and set seed two to three years after a fire. The woody infructescences also release seeds as their follicles are opened with heat, although a proportion do open spontaneously at other times. One field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found 10% opened in the absence of bushfire, and that seeds germinated, and young plants do grow. Older plants are serotinous, that is, they store large numbers of seed in an aerial <b>seed</b> <b>bank</b> in their canopy that are released after fire. Being relatively heavy, the seeds do not disperse far from the parent plant.|$|E
