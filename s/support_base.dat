In contrast, the Australian force had fought together in previous campaigns and was backed up by a formidable logistical <b>support</b> <b>base</b> that could deliver them a technological and industrial superiority that the Japanese were unable to match.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the team's <b>support</b> <b>base</b> {{consists}} of fans of Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb, the two best-supported clubs in the Croatian domestic league, the Prva HNL. The clubs' ultra-style supporter groups, the Bad Blue Boys of Zagreb and The Torcida from Split, have both been associated with hooliganism, though violence between the two groups does not usually occur at international games. Heavy support for the Croatian national team also comes from Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly from fans of Zrinjski Mostar. The official Croatia supporters' club endorsed by the Croatian Football Federation is called Uvijek Vjerni (Always Faithful).|$|E

5|$|After Syria became {{independent}} in 1946, al-Bakri joined the pro-Western and Arab nationalist People's Party. President al-Atassi assigned him ambassador to Jordan, {{ruled by the}} Hashemites, after al-Bakri refused the ambassadorial post to Saudi Arabia, a government that he opposed ideologically. Following Adib al-Shishakli's seizure of the presidency in 1953, al-Bakri resigned. After al-Shishakli stepped down in 1954, al-Bakri {{became president of the}} People's Party. He was unsuccessful in establishing a significant <b>support</b> <b>base</b> in Damascus and resigned from political life in April 1957. He died in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Although the DPP {{passed a}} {{resolution}} to ban all factions within the party in 2006, the dissent between former members of different factions was still present and {{was thought to be}} one of the factors that led to DPP's loss in the presidential election. Chai, along with Koo Kwang-ming emphasized the importance of consolidating the party's policy on independence, while Tsai Ing-wen focused on the cooperation of former factions and expansion of the party's <b>support</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{reportedly}} saw {{the poll}} {{as an opportunity}} to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could frame and justify his refusal to participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist authoritarianism. Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and championed the referendum as a first step in nurturing democracy. His <b>support</b> <b>base</b> was to use this as a means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.|$|E

5|$|Karmal was {{promoted}} to Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers on 27 December 1979. He remained in office until 1981, when he was succeeded by Sultan Ali Keshtmand. Throughout his term, Karmal worked to establish a <b>support</b> <b>base</b> for the PDPA by introducing several reforms. Among these were the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, introducing a general amnesty for those people imprisoned during Nur Mohammad Taraki's and Amin's rule. He also replaced the Khalqist flag with a more traditional one. These policies failed to increase the PDPA's legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the Afghan people.|$|E
5|$|Monuments at El Cayo {{record that}} Yo'nal Ahk III was {{involved}} in burial ceremonies for a sajal in 763 AD, although he {{was not involved in}} picking the leader's successor. It is also known that during his reign, a k'ini' ajaw—or prince—of Piedras Negras, T'ul Chiik, was captured by Yaxun B'alam IV of Yaxchilan; it has been hypothesized by Martin and Grube that Yo'nal Ahk III's focus on smaller satellite kingdoms such as La Mar and El Cayo was a tactic to build up a <b>support</b> <b>base</b> in order to combat the growing threat that Yaxchilan posed. He was succeeded by Ha' K'in Xook, who was possibly his brother.|$|E
5|$|Morales' {{second term}} was heavily {{affected}} by infighting and dissent from {{within his own}} <b>support</b> <b>base,</b> as indigenous and leftist activists came to oppose {{a number of the}} governments' reforms. In May 2010, Morales' government announced a 5% rise in the minimum wage. The Bolivian Workers' Central (COB) felt this insufficient given the rise in the cost of living, and called a general strike. Protesters clashed with police, although the government refused to increase the rise, accusing protesters of being pawns of the right. In August 2010, violent protests then broke out in southern Potosí over widespread unemployment and a lack of investment in infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|Political {{analysts have}} {{suggested}} {{several reasons for}} this victory, including the popularity of Modi, {{and the loss of}} support for the Congress due to the corruption scandals in its previous term. The BJP was also able to expand its traditionally upper-caste, upper-class <b>support</b> <b>base</b> and received significant support from middle-class and Dalit people, as well as among Other Backward Classes. Its support among Muslims remained low; only 8% of Muslim voters voted for the BJP. The BJP was also very successful at mobilising its supporters, and raising voter turnout among them.|$|E
5|$|Several Aleppan dignitaries {{supported}} Emir Faisal and in late October 1918, {{following the}} Sharifian army's entry into Aleppo, {{a branch of}} the Arab Club was founded in the city. The Arab Club's ideology was a mix of Arab nationalism and Aleppine regionalism. It promoted the concept of Syrian national unity, and served as a political <b>support</b> <b>base</b> for Emir Faisal. Among the Arab Club's founders were Ibrahim Hananu, the president of Aleppo Vilayet's presidential council, Rashid al-Tali'a, governor of Aleppo Vilayet, Najib Bani Zadih, a wealthy Aleppine merchant, Abd al-Rahman al-Kayyali, an Aleppine physician and Shaykh Mas'ud al-Kawakibi, one of the city's leading Muslim scholars.|$|E

5|$|Tension grew {{between the}} Pelham {{ministry}} and George, {{as he continued}} to take advice from Carteret and rejected pressure from his other ministers to include William Pitt the Elder in the Cabinet, which would have broadened the government's <b>support</b> <b>base.</b> The king disliked Pitt because he had previously opposed government policy and attacked measures seen as pro-Hanoverian. In February 1746, Pelham and his followers resigned. George asked Lord Bath and Carteret to form an administration, but after less than 48 hours they returned the seals of office, unable to secure sufficient parliamentary support. Pelham returned to office triumphant, and George was forced to appoint Pitt to the ministry.|$|E
5|$|The French {{authorities}} imprisoned Long {{and many}} of his supporters, who openly admitted their aim of overthrowing French authorities at the trial. During the 1916 Cochinchina uprisings against French rule, many of Long's supporters attempted to break him out of jail. The French easily repelled the attack on the jail, decimating Long's movement. Following the attempted breakout, Long and his key supporters were put to death. Many of the remnants of his <b>support</b> <b>base</b> went on to join what later became the Cao Đài, a major religious sect in Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Shamrock Rovers supporters originate from the Southside of Dublin, but the club attracts fans {{from across the}} city and country.

Their <b>support</b> <b>base</b> contains a number of clubs dedicated to supporting the team at away games. It also contains an ultras group, {{which was the first}} formed in Ireland, the SRFC Ultras, who produce choreographed displays of support at games. They have connections with other European groups including supporters of Roma, Hammarby and Panathinaikos.|$|E

Those hamlets that were deemed to be tenable were consolidated, while the remainder were dismantled and their inhabitants returned to their ancestral land.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an adaptive video denoising technique {{based on the}} intersection of confidence intervals (ICI) rule used for adaptive filter support size calculation. The method is applied to three real-life video signals and its denoising performance is compared to a fixed size filter <b>support</b> <b>based</b> method resulting in a significant estimation error reduction {{in terms of the}} average frame peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) improvement. The average frame PSNR obtained by using the here presented ICI based video denoising method is increased by up to 14. 64 dB and by up to 23. 74 dB when compared to the fixed size filter <b>support</b> <b>based</b> method. Furthermore, unlike the fixed size filter <b>support</b> <b>based</b> method, the adaptive ICI based method is shown to be efficient in a moving object edge preserving, while avoiding its blurring. The method performs well for both video signals obtained by recording stationary scenes, and video signals of moving objects, which are far more often encountered in practical applications, whereas the fixed size filter <b>support</b> <b>based</b> method is limited only to video signals of stationary scenes...|$|R
