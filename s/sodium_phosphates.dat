500|$|While McDonald's {{had been}} trying to develop and test a similar product for several years, the company was caught off guard at the time when its {{mainline}} competitors introduced their grilled chicken products and was not able to initially deploy a similar product. This was primarily due to the fact the company's highly specialized kitchens could not produce a high quality product without a large investment in new equipment. By early 1991, McDonald's grilled chicken product was still in development, and the vendor would not introduce its version, the McGrilled Chicken Classic, until 1994. The McGrilled chicken sandwich was replaced with the Grilled Chicken Deluxe sandwich in September and October 1996 as part of McDonald's Deluxe line of [...] "upscale" [...] sandwiches; the company had hoped that a higher value product would help improve average check performance at its stores. However, by 1998 the whole Deluxe line was said to be not selling well, and the Grilled Chicken Deluxe was eliminated when McDonald's brought back the Chicken McGrill sandwich back in 1999. The Chicken McGrill sandwich was retired in 2005 when the company introduced its new Premium line of products, which like the TenderCrisp sandwich was targeted to a more adult audience with higher quality ingredients such as natural cheeses and whole leaf lettuce. Beginning in April 2015, McDonald's moved to a new grilled chicken sandwich, the Artisan Grilled Chicken; the new chicken uses a smaller list of ingredients in the chicken filet, removing ingredients such as maltodextrin and <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphates.</b> The new sandwich is in response to consumer-based market trends of food products that have simpler, more natural ingredients.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesTo compare three bowel {{preparation}} regimens for colonoscopy {{in terms}} of the quality of preparation, the side effects and patient acceptance. MethodsA total of 299 patients who underwent colonoscopy were randomized to three bowel preparation regimens: polyethylene glycol solution (n = 106), or a single dose (n = 92) or two doses (n = 101) of <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> solution. The colonoscopists who recorded the quality of bowel preparation were blind to the preparation regimens. The discomforts associated with bowel preparation and patient acceptance of the preparation were also recorded. ResultsTwo doses of <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> solution achieved significantly better bowel preparation than polyethylene solution or a single dose of <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> solution (p < 0. 05). Although two doses of <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> solution was associated with more dizziness and anal irritation, patients preferred preparation with <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> solution than with polyethylene glycol solution. Of the 69 patients in the <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> solution groups who had prior experience of bowel preparation using polyethylene glycol solution, 55 patients (80 %) stated that they preferred <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> solution.

We evaluated their tolerability and palatability in Saudi Arabian (SA) and UK children. Methods: Prospective observational/interview study (three months in each country). Palatability was evaluated using a five-point facial scale and tolerability by direct questioning of patient/parents. Results: In SA, of 122 patients (2 – 10 years) recruited: 52 received prednisolone base tablets; 37 prednisolone <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> syrup; 33 dexamethasone elixir.

In both countries dexamethasone had the highest palatability scores (SA mean: 1. 97; UK mean: 3) and prednisolone base tablets the lowest (SA mean: 1. 12; UK mean: 1. 39). Palatability scores improved for all formulations of prednisolone with each subsequent daily dose. In SA prednisolone base tablets were associated with more nausea (24 vs 7 patients) and vomiting (5 vs 0) than <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> syrup (P= 0. 008 and P= 0. 073 respectively).
