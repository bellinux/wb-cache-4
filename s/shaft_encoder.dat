40|$|Abstract—Conventional {{vector control}} of IPMSM {{requires}} a motor position sensor to correctly orient the current vector orthogonally to the flux. Thus, {{a high degree}} of torque control over a wide speed range can be achieved. Rotor speed position is measured using <b>shaft</b> <b>encoder</b> which is fixed manually on the rotor such that positive edge of the home signal per one revolution Z of the <b>shaft</b> <b>encoder</b> coincides with the zero reference position of phase-A. However, <b>shaft</b> <b>encoder</b> placement may be significantly inaccurate due to human mechanical error during fixing. This paper shows that misplaced the <b>shaft</b> <b>encoder</b> not only leads to unbalance operation of the inverter and motor phases, which increases the low frequency harmonics in torque ripple and degrades the overall drive performance but also, reduces the overall torque obtained from the vector controlled drive system due to the reduction of the quadrature-axis component of current. However, a novel technique is theoretically proposed and experimentally applied to determine on-line the value of error angle between positive edge of home signal Z of the <b>shaft</b> <b>encoder</b> and zero position of phase-A, to achieve a better dynamic performance.

40|$|For {{measuring}} draft {{force and}} drawbar power requirements for mounted implements, precise instruments such as three-point hitch dynamometers and tractor speed measurement devices are needed. In this research, a frame-type three-point hitch dynamometer was built and evaluated. Forces applied to dynamometer are measured by three separate load cells {{located on a}} frame which can be attached to tractor’s three-point hitch. Each dynamometer’s load cell measures load using a strain gauge bridge circuit. Each load cell was calibrated by applying a known load and measuring bridge circuit’s output voltage. Dynamometer was calibrated by the application of known forces and measuring the output voltage of the strain gauge bridges. The calibration showed {{a high degree of}} linearity between the applied forces and the bridge outputs (R 2 = 0. 996).

40|$|The {{measurement}} of instantaneous angular speed is being increasingly investigated {{for its use}} {{in a wide range}} of condition monitoring and prognostic applications. Central to many measurement techniques are incremental shaft encoders recording the arrival times of shaft angular increments. The conventional approach to processing these signals assumes that the angular increments are equidistant. This assumption is generally incorrect when working with toothed wheels and especially zebra tape encoders and has been shown to introduce errors in the estimated shaft speed. There are some proposed methods in literature that aim to compensate for this geometric irregularity. Some of the methods require the shaft speed to be perfectly constant for calibration, something rarely achieved in practice. Other methods assume the shaft speed to be nearly constant with minor deviations. Therefore existing methods cannot calibrate the entire <b>shaft</b> <b>encoder</b> geometry for arbitrary shaft speeds. The present article presents a method to calculate the <b>shaft</b> <b>encoder</b> geometry for arbitrary shaft speed profiles. The method uses Bayesian linear regression to calculate the encoder increment distances. The method is derived and then tested against simulated and laboratory experiments.

40|$|Multilevel {{inverters}} {{are very}} popular for medium and high-voltage induction motor (IM) drive applications. They have superior performance compared to 2 -level inverters such as reduced harmonic content in output voltage and current, lower {{common mode voltage}} and dv/dt, and lesser voltage stress on power switches. To get nearly sinusoidal current waveforms, the switching frequency of the conventional inverters have to be in¬creased. This will lead to higher switching losses and electromagnetic interference. The problem in using lower switching frequency is the introduction of low order harmonics in phase currents and undesirable torque ripple in the motor. The 5 th and 7 th harmonics are dominant for hexagonal voltage space-vector based low frequency switching. Dodecagonal voltage space-vector based multilevel inverters have been proposed as an improvement over the conventional hexagonal space vector based inverters. They achieve complete elimination of 5 th and 7 th order harmonics throughout the modulation range. The linear modulation range is also extended by about 6. 6 %, since the dodecagon is closer to circle than a hexagon. The previous works on dodecagonal voltage space vector based VSI fed drives used voltage controlled PWM (VC-PWM). Although these controllers are more popular, they have inferior dynamic performance when compared to current controlled PWM (CC¬PWM). VSIs using current controlled PWM have excellent dynamic response, inherent short-circuit protection and are simple to implement. The conventional CC-PWM tech¬niques have large switching frequency variation and large current ripple in steady-state. xix As a result, there has been signiﬁcant research interest to achieve current controlled VSI fed IM drives with constant switching frequency. Two current error space vector (CESV) based hysteresis controllers for dodecagonal voltage space-vector based VSI fed induction motor drives are proposed in this work. The proposed controllers achieve nearly constant switching frequency at steady state operation, similar to VC-SVPWM based VSI fed IM drives. They also have fast dynamic response {{while at the same}} time achieving complete elimination of ﬁfth and seventh order harmonics for the entire modulation range, due to dodecagonal voltage vector switching. The ﬁrst work proposes a nearly constant switching frequency current error space vector (CESV) based hysteresis controller for an IM drive with single dodecagonal voltage space vectors. Parabolic boundaries computed oﬄine are used in the proposed controller. An open-end winding induction motor is fed from two inverters with asymmetrical DC link voltages, to generate the dodecagonal voltage space vectors. The drive scheme is ﬁrst studied at diﬀerent frequencies with a space vector based PWM (SVPWM) control, to obtain the current error space vector boundaries. The CESV boundary at each frequency can be approximated with four parabolas. These parabolic boundaries are used in the proposed controller to limit the CESV trajectory. Due to symmetries in the parabolas only two set of parabola parameters, at diﬀerent frequencies, need to be stored. A generalized next vector selection logic, valid for all sectors and rotation direction, is used in the proposed controller. For this an axis transformation is done in all sectors, to bring the CESV trajectory to the ﬁrst sector. The sector information is obtained from the estimated fundamental stator phase voltage. The proposed controller is extensively studied using vector control at diﬀerent frequencies and transient conditions. This controller maintains nearly constant switching frequency at steady state operation, similar to VC-SVPWM inverters, {{while at the same time}} achieving better dynamic performance and complete elimination of 5 th and 7 th order harmonics throughout the modulation range. In the second work the nearly constant switching frequency current hysteresis con¬troller is extended to multilevel dodecagonal voltage space-vector based IM drives, with online computation of CESV boundaries. The multilevel dodecagonal space-vector dia¬gram has diﬀerent types of triangles, and the previously proposed methods for multilevel hexagonal VSI based current hysteresis controllers cannot be used directly. The CESV trajectory of the VC-SVPWM, obtained for present triangular region, is used as the reference trajectory of the proposed controller. The CESV reference boundaries are com¬puted online, using switching dwell time and voltage error vector of each applied vector. These quantities are calculated from estimated sampled reference phase voltages, which are found out from the stator current error ripple and the parameters of the induction motor. Whenever the actual current error space vector crosses the reference CESV tra¬jectory, an appropriate vector that will force it along the reference trajectory is switched. Extensive study of the proposed controller using vector control is done at diﬀerent fre¬quencies and transient conditions. This controller has all the advantages of multilevel switching like low dv/dt, lesser electromagnetic interference, lower switch voltage stress and lesser harmonic distortion, in addition to all the dynamic performance advantages of the previous controller. The third work proposes an elegant 5 th and 7 th order harmonic suppression tech¬nique for open end winding split-phase induction motors, using capacitor fed inverters. Split-phase induction motors have been proposed to reduce the torque and ﬂux ripples of conventional three-phase IM. But these motors have high 5 th and 7 th order harmonics in the stator windings due to lack of back-emf for these frequencies. A space-vector harmonic analysis of the split-phase IM is conducted and possible 5 th and 7 th order harmonic sup¬pression techniques studied. A simple harmonic suppression scheme is proposed, which requires the use of only capacitor fed inverters. A PWM scheme that can maintain the capacitor voltage as well as suppress the 5 th and 7 th order harmonics is also proposed. To test the performance of the proposed scheme, an open-loop v/f control is used on an open-end winding split-phase induction motor under no-load condition. Synchronized PWM with two samples per sector was used, for frequencies above 10 Hz. The har¬monic spectra of the phase voltages and currents were computed and compared with the traditional SVPWM scheme, to highlight the harmonic suppression. The concepts were initially simulated in Matlab/Simulink. Experimental veriﬁca¬tion was done using laboratory prototypes at low power. While these concepts maybe easily extended to higher power levels by using suitably rated devices, the control tech¬niques presented shall still remain applicable. TMS 320 F 2812 DSP platform was used to execute the control code for the proposed drive schemes. For the ﬁrst work the output pins of the DSP was directly used to drive the inverter switches through a dead-band circuit. For the other two works, DSP outputs the sector information and the PWM signals. The PWM terminals and I/O lines of the DSP is used to output the timings and the triangle number respectively. An FPGA (XC 3 S 200) was used to translate the sector information and the PWM signals to IGBT gate signal logic. A constant dead-time of 1. 5 µs was also implemented inside the FPGA. Opto-isolated gate drivers with desaturation protection (M 57962 L) were used to drive the IGBTs. The phase currents and DC bus voltages were measured using hall-eﬀect sensors.
