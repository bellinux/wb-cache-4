5|$|Multiple <b>static</b> <b>lines</b> of defence, {{to delay}} the enemy's advance. Hitler had in fact {{forbidden}} the construction of multiple lines, saying that soldiers would be tempted to abandon their current line in favour of falling back to the next; Model ignored this order.|$|R

25|$|Areas {{south of}} the Rhine river were liberated in the period September–December 1944, {{including}} the province of Zeeland, which was liberated in October and November in the Battle of the Scheldt. This opened Antwerp to allied shipping. The First Canadian Army held a <b>static</b> <b>line</b> along the river Meuse (Maas) from December 1944 through February 1945.|$|E
25|$|Whilst a success, {{this result}} {{was greeted with}} dismay by the corps commander, the Earl of Cavan; he was a believer in a more {{traditional}} strongly held <b>static</b> <b>line</b> of defence and felt that Fanshawe {{did not need to}} have given up any ground at all. Fanshawe was quickly relieved of his command and ordered home, leaving Italy four days {{after the end of the}} battle, on 20 June.|$|E
50|$|Several of {{the methods}} {{described}} below force exactly one, or no, moving lines, whereas the traditional yarrow-stalk method allows from zero to six moving lines. The yarrow-stalk method favours <b>static</b> <b>lines</b> over moving lines in the ratio 3:1, and favours old yang to old yin in the same ratio.|$|R
50|$|Paratroopers' main parachutes {{are usually}} {{deployed}} by <b>static</b> <b>lines</b> that release the parachute, yet retain the deployment bag {{that contains the}} parachute—without relying on a pilot chute for deployment. In this configuration the deployment bag {{is known as a}} direct-bag system, in which the deployment is rapid, consistent, and reliable.|$|R
50|$|Most {{analyses}} of the probabilities of either the coin method or yarrow-stalk method agree on the probabilities for each method. The coin method varies significantly from the yarrow-stalk method, in that the former gives the same probability to both the moving lines and to both the <b>static</b> <b>lines,</b> {{which is not the}} case in the yarrow-stalk method.|$|R
25|$|Module 5 Continuation {{training}} is {{the conclusion of}} the SOFQ course, and candidates are posted to an operational ARW task unit as an assault team operator. 3 Star Privates (and equivalents) who are successful in completing the SOFQ course pass out at the rank of Acting Corporal, and the lowest commissioned rank in the unit is that of Captain. All candidates must successfully complete the basic parachute course of five (5) <b>static</b> <b>line</b> jumps from 3,000 feet using T10 round canopies.|$|E
25|$|On 11 December, India airdropped the 2 Parachute Battalion Group in the {{now famous}} Tangail airdrop. The {{operation}} involved An-12s, C-119s, 2 Caribous and Dakotas from various squadrons. In total, about 700 troops were airdropped. The only hitch was one paratrooper, Hav Mahadeo, who had a <b>static</b> <b>line</b> hangup. Gnats from No. 22 Squadron provided top cover for the operation, which ultimately went unhindered. Also, on 11 December, three converted An-12s from the No. 44 Squadron struck the Jaydebpur Ordnance factory in East Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|Advanced Airborne Package – Extremely {{important}} to Force Recon for inserting Marines behind enemy lines. In this three-week period, Marines will transition from conventional Low Level <b>Static</b> <b>Line</b> (LLSL) insertions into the hallmark HAHO techniques. Usually {{it consists of}} consecutive night jumps with night combat equipment, but HAHO training {{is done in the}} Paraloft of the S3 Section using a complex virtual reality-based (VR) computer system. While wearing a VR headset device, the Marines hang suspended from the Paraloft ceiling that resembles the MC-5 Ram Air parachute. Many simulations are factored in this Virtual Reality Parachute Simulation; it allows the Marine to jump at high altitudes and visually check his main canopy for proper deployment, alleviate malfunctions, to cutaway and deploy a reserve parachute, then employ guidance and control to an unmarked drop zone (DZ).|$|E
50|$|The Corcoran jump {{boots were}} {{initially}} {{replaced by the}} Combat Boots. This particular change was ferociously challenged by the airborne, as the double-buckled cuff {{at the top of}} the boots could allegedly sometimes catch parachute <b>static</b> <b>lines</b> and seriously injure a jumper, though they also preferred the Corcoran boots for the status that they gave above regular infantry.|$|R

40|$|Both {{research}} and practice have shown that preexistence of long-term associations/clusters of active and competitive organizations, the so-called virtual organizations breeding environments (VBEs), can greatly enhance dynamic creation of virtual organizations (VOs). During the past decade, a number of VBEs are formed worldwide, mostly among organizations located in a common region that, in principle, have common business culture and other similarities, and primarily focus on <b>static</b> <b>lines</b> of activities. The second-generation VBEs addressed in this paper; however, aim to focus on associations/clusters that are not bound to geographical regions or <b>static</b> <b>lines</b> of activities, and wish to act as well recognized and competitive entities in the society/market, facilitating time/cost effective and fluid configuration, and establishment of dynamic VOs. The proposed VBEs apply supporting information and communication technology infrastructures, tools, and services that provide common grounds for the interaction and cooperation among their member organizations. Furthermore, these multiregional VBEs assist with the needed evolution of VOs, introducing new approaches and mechanisms to build trust, define the needed collaboration business culture, and establish the common value systems and working/sharing principles among their independent organizations, among others. The paper introduces a number of models, methodologies, and tools that are designed and developed supporting both the management as well as successful operation of the second-generation VBEs...|$|R
25|$|Parachute pack systems – The {{parachute}} {{is one of}} the trademarks of Force Recon, {{throughout its}} existence the operators have extensively used a wide variety of parachutes. In the mid-1950s, they used the T-10, then later adopting the Capewell canopy release which provided a cut-away to reduce the deadly effect of drag. The T-10 became the most frequented parachute; which had two variants, one for low-level <b>static</b> <b>line</b> (LLSL) and the other for military free fall (MFF) descends. They had numerous parachutes listed under the Table of Equipment (T/E) that had been contained in the Paraloft. Even in its formative days in the Marine Corps Test Unit#1, the operators and testers of the Naval Parachute Unit (NPU) at El Centro had tested and sported numerous parachutes, adding modifications and suggestions that soon were adopted by other parachutists. By the 1990s, the MC-4 and MC-5 Ram Air Parachutes became the feasible choice, as it allows more detailed and accurate landing in smaller areas, easy to control—especially during oscillation of the canopy. Plus, it was formed to modulate between the LLSL and MFF without having to consort to a different pack.|$|E
500|$|Of the albums documenting Davis' 1973–75 band, Agharta was {{considered}} by many critics to be the best, in retrospect. For Tingen, it represented the [...] "high plateau" [...] of the musician's electric explorations; because he had given the band leeway for constant interplay, the music exhibited an [...] "organic and fluid quality", with {{a greater variety of}} textures, rhythms, timbres, and moods than Dark Magus. Davis biographer Jack Chambers believed it proved far better than most of his other electric albums; the [...] "Maiysha" [...] and [...] "Jack Johnson" [...] segments, Chambers wrote, [...] "magically brought into focus the musical forces over which many thought Davis had lost control". Reflecting on his 1970s concert recordings, J. D. Considine contended that Aghartas [...] "alternately audacious, poetic, hypnotic, and abrasive" [...] music had endured the passage of time best. Although Davis' use of wah-wah was frequently dismissed in the past as a failed experiment, Richard Cook and Brian Morton wrote in The Penguin Guide to Jazz (2006) that the effects pedal in fact helped him achieve remarkably adventurous playing on the album, [...] "creating surges and ebbs in a harmonically <b>static</b> <b>line,</b> allowing Miles to build huge melismatic variations on a single note". Cook named it among Davis' best works and the culmination of the music he had begun to explore on Bitches Brew (1970); as well as possessing an [...] "epic" [...] sound and scope, Agharta was [...] "a great band record", in his opinion. [...] "Even though Davis contributed only telling details, he still cued exceptional performances from his men." [...] Robert Christgau saw it as his finest music since Jack Johnson, an [...] "angry, dissociated, funky" [...] record built on the septet's virtuosic performance, particularly Foster's [...] "guileless show of chops" [...] and Fortune's woodwind playing, which he deemed the best on a Davis album from this decade. Henry Kaiser called Agharta the best ensemble performance of jazz's electric era, and Steve Holtje, writing in MusicHound Jazz (1998), credited Davis with conducting the album's [...] "heroes" [...] to sculpt [...] "moments of shattering beauty and soul-rending vehemence".|$|E
2500|$|The first {{parachute}} jump in history {{was made by}} André-Jacques Garnerin, {{the inventor of the}} parachute, on October 22, 1797. Garnerin tested his contraption by leaping from a hydrogen balloon [...] above Paris. Garnerin's parachute bore little resemblance to today's parachutes, however, as it was not packed into any sort of container and did not feature a ripcord. The first intentional freefall jump with a ripcord-operated deployment was not made until over a century later by Leslie Irvin in 1919. [...] While Georgia Broadwick made an earlier freefall in 1914 when her <b>static</b> <b>line</b> became entangled with her jump aircraft's tail assembly, her freefall descent was not planned. Broadwick cut her <b>static</b> <b>line</b> and deployed her parachute manually, only as a means of freeing herself from the aircraft to which she had become entangled.|$|E

2500|$|If a skydiver {{experiences}} a malfunction of their main parachute which they cannot correct, they pull a [...] "cut-away" [...] {{handle on the}} front right-hand side of their harness (on the chest) which will release the main canopy from the harness/container. Once free from the malfunctioning main canopy, the reserve canopy can be activated manually by pulling a second handle on the front left harness. Some containers are fitted with a connecting line from the main to reserve parachutes – known as a reserve <b>static</b> <b>line</b> (RSL) – which pulls open the reserve container faster than a manual release could. Whichever method is used, a spring-loaded pilot-chute then extracts the reserve parachute from {{the upper half of}} the container.|$|E

50|$|The only {{difficulty}} {{was that}} the TF-1 Trader never in the past had foreseen its use in parachute deployment, modifications {{were made to the}} bombing bay chutes by mounting anchor-line cables to allow parachutists to hook up their <b>static</b> <b>lines.</b> After a thorough review of aerial and still photography, plus extra scrutiny of the aircraft, they attached dummies with the appropriate weight and gear and tested its use. Major Meyers, CWO Lew Vinson and two other NPU parachute engineers made the first live jumps from the TF-1 carrier aircraft on 9-13 July 1956. They began to test later jumps with the TF-1 by wearing additional combat gear, including weapons, packs and the AN/GRC9 radio.|$|R
