50|$|In {{a single}} {{receiver}} residential installation {{there is a}} single coaxial cable running from the receiver set-top box in the building to the LNB on the dish. The DC electric power for the LNB is provided through the same coaxial cable conductors that carry the signal to the receiver. In addition, control signals are also transmitted from the receiver to the LNB through the cable. The receiver uses different power supply voltages (13 / 18 V) to select antenna polarization, and pilot tones (22 kHz) to instruct the LNB to select one of the two frequency bands. In larger installations each band and polarization is given its own cable, so there are 4 cables from the LNB to a switching matrix, which allows the connection of multiple receivers in a star topology using the same <b>signalling</b> <b>method</b> as in a single receiver installation.|$|E

The inquiry recommended that tablet machines be placed in the signal box under the sole control of the signalman, and also that starting signals (which gave trains authority to leave the station) be interlocked with the tablet instruments, so that they could not be cleared until the correct tablet had been released. However, this would involve the rebuilding of the station buildings and signal boxes at Abermule and several other small stations, and it was suggested that alternate single-line sections use the electric tablet system and the older electric staff system; there would be no possibility of mistaking a staff for a tablet.

40|$|Electronic {{identification}} is an increasingly pervasive technology that permits rapid data recovery from low-power transponders whenever they are placed within {{the vicinity of}} an interrogator device. Fundamental benefits include proximity detection not requiring line-of-sight, multiple transponder access and data security. In this document, electronic identification methods for asset management are devised for the new target application of electrical appliance testing. In this application mains-powered apparatus are periodically subjected a prescribed series of electrical tests performed by a Portable Appliance Tester (PAT). The intention is to enhance the process of appliance identification and management, and to automate the test process as far as possible. Three principal methods of electronic identification were designed and analysed for this application: proximity Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), cable RFID and power- line signalling. Each method relies on an inductively coupled mechanism that utilities a signalling technique called direct-load modulation. This is particularly suited to low- cost passive transponder designs. Physical limitations to proximity RFID are identified including coil size, orientation and susceptibility to nearby conducting surfaces. A novel inductive <b>signalling</b> <b>method</b> called cable RFID is then described that permits automatic appliance identification. This method uses the appliance power cable and inlet filter to establish a communication channel between interrogator and transponder. Prior to commencing the test phase, an appliance is plugged into the PAT and identified automatically via cable RFID. An attempt is made to extend the scope of cable RFID by developing a novel mains power-line <b>signalling</b> <b>method</b> that uses direct-load modulation and passive transponders. Finally, two different implementations of RFID interrogator are described. The first {{takes the form of}} an embeddable module intended for incorporation into electronic identification products such as RFID enabled PAT units. Software Defined Radio (SDR) principles are applied to the second interrogator design in an effort to render the device reconfigurable. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the design}} and {{analysis}} of a new bandwidth-efficient <b>signalling</b> <b>method</b> over the bandlimited intensity-modulated direct-detection (IM/DD) channel is pro- posed. The channel can be modeled as a bandlimited channel with nonnegative input and additive white Gaussian noise. Due to the nonnegativity constraint, the methods previously proposed for conventional bandlimited channels cannot be applied here. We propose a method to transmit without intersymbol interference in a narrower bandwidth compared to previous works, by combining Nyquist pulses with a constant bias. In fact, we can transmit with a bandwidth {{equal to that of}} coherent transmission. A trade-off between the required average optical power and the bandwidth is investigated. At low bandwidths, the most power- efficient transmission is obtained by either the parametric linear pulse or the so-called “better than Nyquist” pulse, depending on the exact bandwidth...|$|E

40|$|In this study, a {{novel and}} generic <b>signalling</b> <b>method</b> is {{proposed}} {{that results in}} {{a significant reduction in}} signalling messages exchanged between a user equipment and the network over the air interface. Reduction of signalling messages in future mobile cellular systems is an important issue because of the current trend of deploying smaller cells while achieving higher than expected data area capacities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method within the standard constraints, some signalling procedures of the 3 rd generation mobile standard, Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), are investigated. In one application, the number of UMTS packet switch call setup messages was reduced down to three messages only. In such a scenario, measurements show that the gains in comparison with prior call setup is 61 % in the duration of the call setup, 50 % in the downlink processing delays, 93 % in the downlink radio power transmission and 79 % in the uplink radio power transmission...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of multicellular organisms from monocellular ancestors {{represents one of}} the greatest advances of the history of life. The assembly of such multicellular organisms requires signalling and response between cells: over millions of years these signalling processes have become extremely sophisticated and refined by evolution, such that study of modern organisms {{may not be able to}} shed much light on the original ancient processes. Here we are interested in determining how simple a <b>signalling</b> <b>method</b> can be, while still achieving self-assembly. In 2 D a coupled cellular automaton/differential equation approach models organisms and chemotaxic chemicals, producing spiralling aggregation. In 3 D Lennard-Jones-like particles are used to represent single cells, and their evolution in response to signalling is followed by molecular dynamics. It is found that if a single cell is able to emit a signal which induces others to move towards it, then a colony of single-cell organisms can assemble into shapes as complex as a tower, a ball atop a stalk, or a fast-moving slug.

40|$|IEEE 802. 11 WLAN {{service is}} {{broadening}} its service area rapidly. One {{of the major}} driving factors of WLANs is multimedia services such as VOD or HDTV delivered by multicast protocols. However, there have been little research on how to efficiently operate multicast protocols in IEEE 802. 11 WLANs. The most widespread variants of IEEE 802. 11 standards, 802. 11 b and 802. 11 a, are characterized by the rate adaptation mechanism depending on time-varying wireless link conditions. However the current IEEE 802. 11 WLAN standard does not utilize the rate adaptation function for multicast transmissions. In this {{paper we propose a}} new rate adaptation mechanism for multimedia multicasting in IEEE 802. 11 WLAN environments, called SARM (SNR-based Auto Rate for Multicast). SARM is based on the RBAR (Receiver Based Auto Rate) protocol. Therefore SARM adapts its transmission rate based on the SNR values of mobile nodes. In order to obtain SNR values, since there are no RTS-CTS messages or MAC layer ACK messages in multicast transmissions, SARM needs an additional <b>signalling</b> <b>method</b> by which the AP can estimate channel quality (SNR). By adapting multicast transmission rate based on SNR, SARM guarantees the best quality of multimedia service depending on the mobile nodes ’ link conditions. Moreover the proposed protocol minimizes the portion of wireless channel resource for multimedia multicasting, so that it can allocate more bandwidth to other unicast traffic...|$|E

40|$|Financial {{markets are}} subject to {{sentiment}} from within and beyond their nation's borders. Fund flows either flood markets with liquidity, or drain them {{to the point of}} asset fire sales. This typically occurs in accordance with investors' beliefs and risk preferences and ultimately renders markets unstable. This thesis serves to establish the implications of investor behaviour to financial markets. Chapter 2 proposes macro sentiment as a leading indicator for financial instability within the Early Warning Framework of Borio & Lowe (2002). This <b>signalling</b> <b>method</b> identifies imbalances within the financial system. Key indicators include real equity and property prices, and private credit. Macro sentiment is then shown to display excess pessimism prior to systemic crises and therefore, is a relevant leading indicator. US institutional investor sentiment is measured through the demand for portfolio insurance in Chapter 3. Shefrin (1999) advocates index option markets as the manifestation of institutional investor sentiment. A decrease in index option skewness is associated with bearish sentiment. This chapter applies a non-parametric method to extract the risk-neutral distribution to gauge sentiment based on the 30 -day probability of the underlying reaching the at-the-money futures level, and the third moment. These measures are examined in relation to the VIX, the put-call ratio, the slope of the implied volatility function and the Bakshi, Kapadia & Madan (2003) skew. Chapter 4 proposes a theory of sentiment propagation and examines the link between global and investor sentiment within the US. An extensive literature review of mutual fund flows and sentiment within the broad context of the macroeconomy affirms the use of cross-border fund flows as the channel through which sentiment propagates. The empirical section then establishes congruency between global sentiment, as measured by dedicated USA equity and bond fund flows of US and non-US domiciled investors and sentiment within the US.

40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}}, the causative {{agent of}} tuberculosis {{exists in a}} number of different environmental states. It must therefore have gene regulatory systems which are specific for virulence. One major <b>signalling</b> <b>method</b> is through reversible phosphorylation of proteins, mediated by protein kinases and phosphatases. This study focuses on the function of one serine-threonine protein kinase, PknF, and its substrate, the ABC transporter Rv 1747 which is necessary for growth in a virulent infection. This kinase is known to interact with both of the fork-head associated (FHA) domains of Rv 1747 in a phosphorylation dependent manner. The aims of this study were to analyse the function of Rv 1747 particularly in relation to its requirement for a virulent infection and to investigate how PknF is controlling Rv 1747 function. pknF was shown to be co-transcribed with Rv 1747 and the stimulus sensed by the kinase was investigated. Phenotypic analysis linked the function of Rv 1747 to properties of the cell wall. Transcriptional microarray analysis of pknF and Rv 1747 mutants showed altered expression levels of genes involved in cell wall functions. Moreover, thin layer chromatography revealed changes in lipid profiles between wild type and mutant, but these differences could not be confirmed to be due to the mutation since they were not restored by complementation. Cell wall structure, however, appeared normal by transmission electron microscopy. Experiments to determine how PknF regulates the function of Rv 1747 demonstrated that phosphorylation occurs on two specific threonine residues; mutation analysis indicated that these are likely to be the only residues phosphorylated. The involvement of the FHA domains in this regulation was demonstrated by isothermal titration calorimetry, using peptides containing both phosphothreonine residues. Furthermore, FHA- 1 domain mutation resulted in attenuation in macrophages highlighting its critical role in Rv 1747 function. Infection experiments in macrophages and in mice have been performed using the threonine mutants to determine the in vivo consequences of phosphorylation and hence construct a model of how this regulation takes place. This study has revealed that PknF positively regulates the function of Rv 1747 which is required for growth in both the lungs and spleens of mice...|$|E
40|$|Driven by {{the massive}} growth in {{communications}} data traffic {{as well as}} flourishing users' demands, we need to fully utilize the existing scarce spectrum resource. However, {{there have been several}} studies and reports over the years showing that a large portion of licensed spectrum is actually underutilized in both temporal and spatial domains. Moreover, aiming at facing the dilemma among the fixed spectrum allocation, the ever enormous increasing traffic demand and the limited spectrum resource, cognitive radio (CR) was proposed by Mitola to alleviate the under usage of spectrum. Thus, cognitive radio networking (CRN) has emerged as a promising paradigm to improve the spectrum efficiency and utilization by allowing secondary users (SUs) to utilize the spectrum hole of primary users (PUs). By using spectrum sensing, SUs can opportunistically access spectrum holes for secondary transmission without interfering the transmissions of the PUs and efficient spectrum utilization by multiple PUs and SUs requires reliable detection of PUs. Nevertheless, sensing errors such as false alarm and misdetection are inevitable in practical networks. Hence, the assumption that SUs always obtain the exact channel availability information is unreasonable. In addition, spectrum sensing must be carried out continuously and the SU must terminate its transmission as soon as it senses the re-occupancy by a PU. As a better alternative of spectrum sensing, cooperation has been leveraged in CRN, which is referred as cooperative cognitive radio networking (CCRN). In CCRN, in order to obtain the transmission opportunities, SUs negotiate with the PUs for accessing the spectrum by providing tangible service for PUs. In this thesis, we study cluster based spectrum sharing mechanism for CCRN and investigate on exploiting the cooperative technique in heterogeneous network. First, we develop cooperation protocols for CRN. Simultaneous transmission can be realized through quadrature <b>signalling</b> <b>method</b> in our proposed cooperation protocol. The optimal power allocation has been analyzed and closed-form solution has been derived for amplify and forward mode. Second, we study a cluster based spectrum sharing mechanism. The spectrum sharing is formulated as a combinatorial non-linear optimization problem which is NP-hard. Afterwards, we solve this problem by decomposing it into cluster allocation and time assignment, and we show that the result is close to the optimal solution. Third, we propose a macrocell-femtocell network cooperation scheme for heterogeneous networks under closed access mode. The cooperation between the femtocell network and macrocell network is investigated. By implementing the cooperation, not only the macrocell users' (MUEs') and femtocell users' (FUEs') utility can be improved compared with the non-cooperation case, but also the energy consumption as well as the interference from the femtocell network to the macrocell network can be reduced...|$|E
