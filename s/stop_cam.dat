40|$|Objectives: Although {{research}} {{evidence exists}} to suggest why consumers use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), {{there remains a}} need to distinguish between factors and processes involved in the initial uptake of therapies and those involved in their subsequent maintenance. We therefore conducted a qualitative study to explore and describe consumers' reasons for maintaining or stopping CAM use. Methods: This was a qualitative study. We interviewed 46 CAM consumers and 9 CAM practitioners, in two high-street CAM clinics in the UK. The interviews were analyzed thematically using techniques from grounded theory. Results: Consumers described and evaluated their CAM experiences along four dimensions: interpersonal (e. g., interactions with practitioners), physical (e. g., sensations such as touch or pain during treatment), affective (e. g., empowerment), and cognitive (e. g., beliefs about treatment). They evaluated their experiences {{in relation to their}} individual needs and expectations; financial considerations could limit maintenance of CAM use. Practitioners emphasized the effectiveness of treatment and themselves as contributing to consumers maintaining treatment, and recognized the role of financial considerations in decisions to <b>stop</b> <b>CAM</b> use. Conclusions: This study suggests that experiences of conventional medicine are of limited importance after the decision to initiate CAM. Experiences of CAM were foremost in our consumers' decisions to maintain or stop specific CAM therapies. Maintenance of CAM could occur even if consumers' experiences were not entirely positive. Our findings provide novel, systematic insights that will be of particular interest to practitioners who want to support consumers as they decide whether to maintain CAM use. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Question: Consumers {{are thought}} to use CAM because they are {{attracted}} to attributes of specific CAM therapies and discouraged by negative experiences of conventional medicine. Research evidence supports this hypothesis, but there remains a need to distinguish between factors and processes involved in the initial uptake of therapies and those involved in their subsequent maintenance. We therefore conducted a qualitative study to explore and describe consumers’ reasons for maintaining or stopping CAM use. Methods: This was a qualitative study. We interviewed 46 CAM consumers and 9 CAM practitioners, in two high-street CAM clinics in the UK. The interviews were analysed thematically using techniques from grounded theory. Results: Consumers described and evaluated their CAM experiences along four dimensions: interpersonal (e. g. interactions with practitioners), physical (e. g. sensations such as touch or pain during treatment), affective (e. g. empowerment) and cognitive (e. g. beliefs about treatment). They evaluated their experiences {{in relation to their}} individual needs and expectations; financial considerations could limit maintenance of CAM use. Practitioners emphasised the effectiveness of treatment and themselves as contributing to consumers maintaining treatment, and recognised the role of financial considerations in decisions to <b>stop</b> <b>CAM</b> use. Conclusions: Further work is needed to test and extend our findings in other settings. This study suggests that experiences of conventional medicine are of limited importance after the decision to initiate CAM. Experiences of CAM were foremost in our consumers’ decisions to maintain or stop specific CAM therapies. Maintenance of CAM could occur even if consumers’ experiences were not entirely positive. CAM practitioners may have a vital role to play in ethically supporting consumers’ decisions to maintain CAM use. <br/...|$|E

50|$|Face cams {{may provide}} {{repetitive}} motion with a groove that forms a closed curve, or may provide function generation with a <b>stopped</b> groove. <b>Cams</b> used for function generation may have grooves that require several revolutions {{to cover the}} complete function, and in this case, the function generally needs to be invertible so that the groove does not self intersect, and the function output value must differ enough at corresponding rotations that there is sufficient material separating the adjacent groove segments. A common form is the constant lead cam, where displacement of the follower is linear with rotation, such as the scroll plate in a scroll chuck. Non-invertible functions, which require the groove to self-intersect, can be implemented using special follower designs.|$|R

As the Center Force tried to force a passage through the Sibuyan Sea it was spotted and attacked by US Task Force 38. Although most airstrikes concentrated on the battleship , Myōkō {{was hit by a}} torpedo aft on the starboard side, which damaged her starboard screws. She broke off and headed for Singapore at a reduced speed of 15 kn, arriving on 2 November 1944. After temporary repairs she departed for Japan with a <b>stop</b> at <b>Cam</b> Ranh Bay. En route to Cam Ranh Bay Myōkō was hit by one torpedo from a spread of six, fired by the submarine [...] at 17:35 on 13 December 1944 on her aft port side, blowing away her stern, and leaving her unable to steer. She went dead in the water. Despite the extensive damage to the aft, one port screw remained operable and she could make 6 kn. Unable to steer, she was towed by destroyer [...] (which assisted in damaging Bergall, which survived and returned to Fremantle) and several other ships to Singapore harbor for repairs; however, there were insufficient materials in Singapore to complete the repairs for both Myōkō and Takao, which was also in harbor for repairs.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to study Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) used among {{degenerative}} arthritis patients in Korea. Method: This study used a descriptive survey method. Study subjects of the study were 278 degenerative arthritics selected from hospitals located in Kyungpook province and Daegu city. Data were collected between February 15, 2007 and March 31, 2007. Results: 62. 6 % of degenerative arthritics had used CAM. Manipulative Methods has shown to be one of the most effective methods on CAM. The utilization of CAM may be interpreted mainly due to the desperate need find therapeutics of their disease by all possible means (57. 5 %). Major factors that affect the decision of the patient include family, relatives, friends(42 %), and the other patients who were in the similar circumstance (32. 8 %). Effectiveness of CAM has shown the following result “for complete cure of symptoms(77. 0 %), for health promotion (42. 0 %) and for psychological stabilization (29. 9 %) ”. 43. 7 % of the patients answered that they <b>stopped</b> of using <b>CAM</b> because of non-effectiveness. Conclusion: This study found that CAM among degenerative arthritic patients was a popular alternative method. Therefore, some nursing-oriented intervention method is needed together with a systematic guidelines of CAM usage is required...|$|R
