One of the main challenges in such research is to develop robust analysis techniques {{that are able to}} deal with the multidimensional data that musical sound and body motion present. The article evaluates four different analysis methods applied to an experiment in which participants moved their hands following perceptual features of short sound objects. Motion capture data has been analyzed and correlated with a set of quantitative sound features using four different methods: (a) a pattern recognition classifier, (b) t-tests, (c) <b>Spearman</b> <b>s</b> Á correlation, and (d) canonical correlation.

A retrospective database was queried for the patients diagnosed as phyllodes tumors and fibroadenomas at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital from January 2008 to August 2012. Three hundred and fifty lesions from 323 consecutive patients were included in the study. All the cases were examined by conventional ultrasonography and ultrasound elastography. Ultrasound elastography was used to calculate strain ratio of the lesions with bilateral breast tissue at the same depth as reference. There were 36 phyllodes tumors (27 benign, 8 borderline, 1 malignant) and 314 fibroadenomas (158 the pericanalicular type, 103 the intracanalicular type, 53 other special types). The strain ratio for phyllodes tumors (3. 19 ± 2. 33) was significantly higher than for fibroadenomas (1. 69 ± 0. 88) (p< 0. 05). The <b>Spearman(.)</b> <b>s</b> correlation coefficient between strain ratio of ultrasound elastography and pathological groups was significant, with a value of 0. 17 (p< 0. 05).

Subjects: Twenty-four patients (4 men and 20 women) with moderate-to-severe COPD (FEV 1 41. 3 13 % predicted [mean SD]) aged 68. 1 8 years. Research Method: The SOBQ, providing only a total score, contains 24 items measuring perceptions of dyspnea for a variety of activities of daily living (ADLs). Three experts in pulmonary medicine and nursing classified each item into LE, upper extremity (UE), and WB activity subscores with the LE and WB subscores being the focus of this study. Using these proposed SOBQ subscores, a secondary analysis was performed using data obtained from an 8 week walking program.

Furthermore, this research aimed to establish whether, and how, companies adapt capital budgeting tools to embed sustainability impacts when evaluating capital budgets. This study is a cross-sectional descriptive quantitative research about practices of sustainable capital budgeting and the adaptation of capital budgeting tools to incorporate sustainability impacts. Data were collected through an online survey via a Likert-type scale structured questionnaire. Quantitative data were analysed using summary tables, central tendencies, bar graphs, radars, Fisher s Exact Test, and <b>Spearman</b> <b>s</b> rank correlation coefficient (), while qualitative data were analysed using patterns and categories. The study concluded that Scope- 1 companies practice sustainable capital budgeting because they prioritise sustainability and have motives related to competitive advantage as part of their approach to sustainability. Companies also deal with constraints related to sustainable capital budgeting tools, including discounted cash flows deficiencies and the difficulty in measuring sustainability impacts. A holistic model to incorporate sustainability impacts is still imperative and a PPP model has been suggested. This study contributes to the literature and to business by bridging the gap between sustainability and accounting bodies of knowledge, which are normally regarded as distinct.

40|$|Some current {{similarity}} {{measurement method}} include Normal Euclidean Distance, Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient, Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rank correlation coefficient, Z-Score or standard score, Spearman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Footrule</b> distance, Kendall tau rank coefficient, Jaccard similarity coefficient, Cayley 2 ̆ 7 s distance, hamming distance etc, since they cannot capture {{the similarity between}} genes with arbitrary time-delay and time-gap behavior, a novel algorithm, which enables time-delay alignment and time-gap alignment is proposed and integrated {{with some of those}} existing approaches which are local comparisons to fit into the underlying biological context. Time-delay behavior occurs when a gene 2 ̆ 7 s expression triggers a delayed expression in its co-regulated or anti-co-regulated peers. In addition, arbitrary time lag also might appear due to experiment error or measurement error. If any gene data has one or both of those condition, the similarity measurement using traditional methods will either under-estimate the similarity or completely miss such relationship. 	To align the gene data, an alignment algorithm {{that can be used to}} align time-delay as well as removing time-gap was developed. Because both Normal Euclidean Distance and Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient are local comparisons, the algorithm was able to integrate within those two approaches to accommodate the time-delay and time-gap behavior. All of the implementations are done through parallel programming of Message Passing Interface in C by splitting the work load dynamically from a master server to many slave servers in order to speed up the computation process. 	Synthetic and real microarray data are used to demonstrate the superior of our proposed method. The experimental results show that Normal Euclidean Distance and Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient with our alignment algorithm perform better in terms of capturing the similarity of more co-regulated or anti-regulated gene pairs. Some improvements such as isolation of experimental conditions, weighted averages and statistical analysis for threshold setting are proposed. Because such time-delay behavior in gene expression pattern is not unusual and usually play important roles in the cell system, the new approach will help scientists to discover important knowledge that otherwise will not be revealed. This approach is sensitive to capturing a wide spectrum of expression patterns, which tends to be ignored by traditional methods. Global comparison algorithms usually have a pre-step that normalize the entire dataset to achieve better result, thus the implemented time-delay and time-gap alignment algorithm will not be effective on the normalized data set. In order to cope with the intensive computing needs of large-scale microarray data, parallel code under message passing interface in C is developed with dynamic work load balancing strategy and executed at a Linux cluster...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of how much control individuals have over their data online has taken centre stage with the introduction of the European Union s right to be forgotten (RTBF) principle. However, this principle does not explain the impact and possible consequences that this right has on an individual s willingness to disclose information online. This research examines how an individual s privacy calculus is affected if he or she discloses person ally identifiable information online to service providers. Two hypotheses, the first which, related to the influence the right to be forgotten has on the privacy calculus and, secondly, dealing with the impact of such on information disclosure are assessed using quantitative approach based on an online survey (n= 502). The results were analysed using nonparametric tests, which included <b>Spearman</b> <b>s</b> Correlation, Krusal Wallis and the Mann-Whitney U tests. The findings show that the RTBF principle does influence an individual s thought process prior to he or she disclosing information online. Furthermore, the findings indicated individuals with a medium and high degree of information disclosure would disclose more personally identifiable information if they were convinced that information they provided was not discernible. Some of the findings in this research could be of significance in the areas of information technology, international and criminal law, psychology, politics and human rights. Additionally, this study could be used to address individual privacy through amendments to privacy policies, laws and changes in software engineering practices.

In the works by other authors, {{the accuracy of the}} trajectory statistical methods was estimated for particular species and at specified receptor locations. We have obtained a more general statistical estimation of the accuracy of source reconstruction and have found optimum conditions to reconstruct source distributions of atmospheric trace substances. Only virtual pollutants of the primary type were considered. In real world experiments, TSMs are intended for application to a priori unknown sources. Therefore, the accuracy of TSMs has to be tested with all possible spatial distributions of sources. An ensemble of geographical distributions of virtual sources was generated. <b>Spearman</b> <b>s</b> rank order correlation coefficient between spatial distributions of the known virtual and the reconstructed sources was taken to be a quantitative measure of the accuracy. Statistical estimates of the mean correlation coefficient and a range of the most probable values of correlation coefficients were obtained. All the TSMs that were considered here showed similar close results. The maximum of the ratio of the mean correlation to the width of the correlation interval containing the most probable correlation values determines the optimum conditions for reconstruction. An optimal geographical domain roughly coincides with the area supplying most of the substance to the receptor. The optimal domain s size is dependent on the substance decay time. Under optimum reconstruction conditions, the mean correlation coefficients can reach 0. 70 0. 75. The boundaries of the interval with the most probable correlation values are 0. 6 0. 9 for the decay time of 240 h and 0. 5 0. 95 for the decay time of 12 h. The best results of source reconstruction can be expected for the trace substances with a decay time on the order of several days. Although the methods considered in this paper do not guarantee high accuracy they are computationally simple and fast.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Angiotensin II (Ang II) {{is known}} to induce cardiac growth and {{modulate}} myocardial contractility. It {{has been reported that}} elevated levels of endogenous Ang II {{contribute to the development of}} cardiac hypertrophy in hypertensives. However, the long-term functional effects of cardiac exposure to Ang II in normotensives is unclear. A recently developed transgenic mouse (TG 1306 / 1 R), in which cardiac-specific overproduction of Ang II produces primary hypertrophy, provides a new experimental model for investigation of this phenotype. The aim of the present study was to use this model to investigate whether there is a functional deficit in primary hypertrophy that may predispose to cardiac failure and sudden death. We hypothesised that primary cardiac hypertrophy is associated with mechanical dysfunction in the basal state. METHODS: Normotensive heterozygous TG 1306 / 1 R mice harbouring multiple copies of a cardiac-specific rat angiotensinogen gene 1 were studied at age 30 - 40 weeks and compared with age-matched wild-type littermates. Left ventricular function was measured ex vivo in bicarbonate buffer-perfused, Langendorff- mounted hearts (at a perfusion pressure of 80 mmHg, 37 degrees C) using a fluid-filled PVC balloon interfaced to a pressure transducer and digital data acquisition system. RESULTS: There was no difference in the mean (+SEM) intrinsic heart rate of TG 1306 / 1 R and wild-type control mice (357. 4 +/- 11. 8 vs. 367. 5 +/- 20. 9 bpm, n= 9 & 7). Under standardised end-diastolic pressure conditions, TG 1306 / 1 R hearts exhibited a significant reduction in peak developed pressure (132. 2 +/- 9. 4 vs. 161. 5 +/- 3. 1 mmHg, n= 9 & 7, p< 0. 05) and maximum rate of pressure development (3566. 7 +/- 323. 7 vs. 4486. 3 +/- 109. 4 mmHg, n= 9 & 7, p< 0. 05). TG 1306 / 1 R mice show a significant correlation between incidence of arrhythmia and increasing heart size (<b>Spearman</b> <b>s</b> correlation coefficient 0. 61). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that chronic in vivo exposure to elevated levels of intra-cardiac Ang II is associated with significant contractile abnormalities evident in the ex vivo intact heart. Our findings suggest that endogenous overproduction of cardiac Ang II, independent of changes in blood pressure, is sufficient to induce ventricular remodelling that culminates in impaired cardiac function which may precede failure...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, declines have {{occurred}} in the range and abundance of several passerines and farmland bird species and even though several possible causes have been suggested, the exposure to environmental contaminants and intensification of agriculture have received much attention. Several environmental contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polybrominated flame retardants (PBDEs) have been found to alter steroid hormones levels and may cause adverse effects on reproduction. Present decline in house sparrow numbers appears to be widespread in North-Western Europe since the 1970 s. Among a variety of physical and chemical stressors, endocrine disruptive chemicals (EDCs) may contribute to the decline. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine levels of some selected PCBs (PBC- 28, - 52, - 101, - 118, - 138, - 153, - 180), PBDEs (BDE- 47, - 99, - 100, - 153, - 154, - 209, hexabromocyclododecane [HCBD]) and OCPs (hexachlorobenzene [HCB], dichloro-diphenyl-dichloroethylene [p,p -DDE]) and to investigate the possible effects of these contaminants on circulating levels of steroid hormones (estrone [E 1], 17 &# 945;-estradiol [&# 945;E 2], 17 &# 946;-estradiol [&# 946;E 2], progesterone [PRO], pregnenolone [PRE], Hydroxylated progesterone [OH-PRO], aldosterone [ALDO], androstenedione [AN], dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], dihydrotestosterone [DHT], testosterone [TS]) in adult house sparrows from Leka, Helgeland, Norway. Plasma samples were analysed for steroid hormones by gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) and liver samples were analysed for environmental contaminants by gas chromatography-electron capture detection (GC-ECD) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). It was hypothesized that POPs may have endocrine disrupting effects on the local house sparrow population and can thus interfere with the steroid hormone homeostasis. Multivariate data analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures (O-PLS), and bivariate correlation test (<b>Spearman</b> <b>s</b> rank correlation test) was applied to evaluate the effects of environmental contaminants and biometrical variables on steroid hormone levels. Multivariate regression analysis indicated no strong relationships between contamination load and steroid hormone levels in adult female and male house sparrows, nor did biometrical variables seem to be very important in explaining the variation of the steroid hormones. However, bivariate correlations revealed negative relationships between PCB- 118 and &# 946;E 2 and p,p -DDE, &# 8721;OCPs and E 1 among female house sparrows. Among male sparrows, bivariate correlations indicted positive relationships between DHT levels and PCB- 118, BDE- 100 and &# 8721;PCBs. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to emphasize that statistical significant models were not found in the multivariate analysis and relationships indicated by bivariate correlations should be interpreted with caution. In addition, these statistical correlations do not represent direct cause-effect relationships and no definite conclusion can be made on possible disruptions on estrogen and androgen levels...|$|R

The sample comprises 4178 spectra that are selected to suffer little from the host-galaxy starlight contamination.

40|$|Early {{diagnosis}} of carious lesions {{is a key}} factor in prevention and management of dental caries. With non-invasive, quantitative diagnostic methods {{it should be possible to}} detect lesions at an initial stage and subsequently monitor lesion changes over time during which preventive measures are introduced. Conventional methods are inadequate for a modern approach to clinical caries management. The need for objective and quantitative methods for detecting and monitoring progression of carious lesions is therefore obvious. Aims The present thesis is aimed at evaluating two fluorescence devices, DIAGNOdent and QLF for detection and quantification of carious lesions on smooth surfaces under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, with special reference to applications in orthodontic patients. Material and methods Validity of DIAGNOdent and QLF: (papers I, IV) The validity of two fluorescence methods, DIAGNOdent and QLF, was evaluated for the purpose of caries detection and quantification on non-cavitated carious lesions on smooth surfaces. In paper I, the performance of these fluorescence methods was validated by microradiographic and histopathological analyses in order to correlate the two methods with mineral loss and lesion depth. In paper IV, the DIAGNOdent and the DIAGNOdent pen were validated by histopathological analysis in terms of <b>Spearman</b> <b>s</b> rank correlation coefficient. Reliability of DIAGNOdent and QLF: (papers I, II, IV) The reliability of DIAGNOdent and QLF in terms of observer agreement on quantification of enamel caries on smooth surfaces was evaluated and compared under in vitro conditions employing Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) (paper I, IV). The inter- and intra-observer agreement of the DIAGNOdent method was also tested under in vivo conditions (paper II). Application of DIAGNOdent as a monitoring tool for evaluation of preventive programs: (paper III) The capacity of DIAGNOdent for monitoring caries progression was evaluated in a clinical study where twelve subjects with 127 test teeth were randomly assigned to two caries preventive treatment groups. The lesion changes over a 12 months period were followed by DIAGNOdent. The mean changes of the DIAGNOdent values for the two treatment groups were analyzed by three-way ANOVA. Results In the in vitro studies on comparisons between the fluorescence methods with respect to the correlation with lesion depth, the correlation coefficients for DIAGNOdent and QLF were 0. 76 and 0. 82, respectively (paper I), and 0. 55 and 0. 52 for DIAGNOdent and DIAGNOdent pen, respectively (paper IV). The QLF method showed higher correlation with mineral loss, 0. 84, compared to 0. 64 for DIAGNOdent. The ICC values showed excellent intra-examiner agreement, and good inter-examiner agreement under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. For longitudinal quantification, there was a significant difference in the DIAGNOdent readings between the first and the final evaluation, p= 0. 025. However, the difference between the two treatment groups regarding the changes of DIAGNOdent values over time was not statistically significant, p= 0. 87. Conclusions It was concluded that the applied fluorescence methods are reliable and valid for quantification of natural carious lesions on smooth surfaces.

40|$|Abstract Background The Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ) was {{developed}} {{in response to the}} difficulties of observing and quantifying freezing of gait (FOG) clinically as well as in laboratory settings. However, as the FOGQ is a clinician-administered patient-reported rating scale it cannot be used in postal surveys. Here we report the development and measurement properties of a self-administered version of the FOGQ (FOGQsa). Methods A clinical sample and a postal survey sample of non-demented people with Parkinson's disease (PD; total n = 225) completed the FOGQsa and questionnaires concerning physical functioning (PF) and fall-related self efficacy (FES). Additional questions (No/Yes) regarded previous falls and whether they were afraid of falling. The clinical sample was also assessed with the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS). Thirty-five participants completed FOGQsa and were also assessed with the original version (FOGQ) in a clinical interview. Results There were no differences (P = 0. 12) between FOGQ (median, 10; q 1 -q 3, 2 - 14) and FOGQsa (median, 8; 2 - 14) scores. The <b>Spearman</b> (r <b>s)</b> and intra-class correlations between the two were 0. 92 and 0. 91 (95 % CI, 0. 82 - 0. 95), respectively. For FOGQsa, corrected item-total correlations ranged between 0. 68 - 0. 89. Reliability was 0. 93 (95 % CI, 0. 91 - 0. 94). FOGQsa scores correlated strongest with UPDRS Item 14 (Freezing; r s, 0. 76) and with FES (r s, - 0. 74). The weakest correlation was found with age (r s, 0. 14). Fallers scored significantly (p Conclusions The present findings indicate that the FOGQsa is as reliable and valid as the original interview administered FOGQ version. This has important clinical implications when investigating FOG in large scale studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background & Objectives: Obesity is an {{important}} risk factor for many diseases and hormonal and metabolic factors have {{a great impact on}} its development. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between leptin and growth hormones with anthropometric indices and blood glucose in healthy men.   Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study on 30 healthy adult men aged 18 - 49 years in Tonekabone city during 2011 - 2012. Samples were randomly selected and information on anthropometric parameters (waist circumference, body mass index and waist/hip ratio), fasting blood sugar, serum levels of leptin and growth hormones were recorded and blood sampling was performed After 12 hours of fasting (at 8 am). Data were analyzed using software SPSS 15 by non- parametric Mann – Whitney and <b>Spearman</b> test <b>s</b> and multiple regression analysis.   Results: Serum leptin levels were negatively correlated with serum level of growth hormone (P< 0. 05) and positively related to body mass index (P< 0. 01), waist circumference (P< 0. 01) and the body weight (P< 0. 05). Inverse relationship between serum growth hormone levels with age and fasting blood glucose were observed (P< 0. 05). Serum levels of leptin were significantly higher in overweight and obese than normal weight subjects (P< 0. 01) and mean leptin levels in subjects with central obesity (waist circumference≥ 94 cm) were significantly higher than men without central obesity (waist circumference< 94 cm) (P< 0. 01).   Conclusion: This study showed that growth hormone level was negatively correlated with serum level of leptin. Low serum growth hormone and high serum leptin levels were associated with obesity and upper body fat distribution.

40|$|Background: In {{response}} {{to the need for}} more comprehensive quality assessment within Australian residential aged care facilities, the Clinical Care Indicator (CCI) Tool was developed to collect outcome data as a means of making inferences about quality. A national trial of its effectiveness and a Brisbane-based trial of its use within the quality improvement context determined the CCI Tool represented a potentially valuable addition to the Australian aged care system. This document describes the next phase in the CCI Tool. s development; the aims of which were to establish validity and reliability of the CCI Tool, and to develop quality indicator thresholds (benchmarks) for use in Australia. The CCI Tool is now known as the ResCareQA (Residential Care Quality Assessment). Methods: The study aims were achieved through a combination of quantitative data analysis, and expert panel consultations using modified Delphi process. The expert panel consisted of experienced aged care clinicians, managers, and academics; they were initially consulted to determine face and content validity of the ResCareQA, and later to develop thresholds of quality. To analyse its psychometric properties, ResCareQA forms were completed for all residents (N= 498) of nine aged care facilities throughout Queensland. Kappa statistics were used to assess inter-rater and test-retest reliability, and Cronbach. s alpha coefficient calculated to determine internal consistency. For concurrent validity, equivalent items on the ResCareQA and the Resident Classification Scales (RCS) were compared using <b>Spearman.</b> <b>s</b> rank order correlations, while discriminative validity was assessed using known-groups technique, comparing ResCareQA results between groups with differing care needs, as well as between male and female residents. Rank-ordered facility results for each clinical care indicator (CCI) were circulated to the panel; upper and lower thresholds for each CCI were nominated by panel members and refined through a Delphi process. These thresholds indicate excellent care at one extreme and questionable care at the other. Results: Minor modifications were made to the assessment, and it was renamed the ResCareQA. Agreement on its content was reached after two Delphi rounds; the final version contains 24 questions across four domains, enabling generation of 36 CCIs. Both test-retest and inter-rater reliability were sound with median kappa values of 0. 74 (test-retest) and 0. 91 (inter-rater); internal consistency was not as strong, with a Chronbach. s alpha of 0. 46. Because the ResCareQA does not provide a single combined score, comparisons for concurrent validity were made with the RCS on an item by item basis, with most resultant correlations being quite low. Discriminative validity analyses, however, revealed highly significant differences in total number of CCIs between high care and low care groups (t 199 = 10. 77, p= 0. 000), while the differences between male and female residents were not significant (t 414 = 0. 56, p= 0. 58). Clinical outcomes varied both within and between facilities; agreed upper and lower thresholds were finalised after three Delphi rounds. Conclusions: The ResCareQA provides a comprehensive, easily administered means of monitoring quality in residential aged care facilities that can be reliably used on multiple occasions. The relatively modest internal consistency score was likely due to the multi-factorial nature of quality, and the absence of an aggregate result for the assessment. Measurement of concurrent validity proved difficult {{in the absence of a}} gold standard, but the sound discriminative validity results suggest that the ResCareQA has acceptable validity and could be confidently used as an indication of care quality within Australian residential aged care facilities. The thresholds, while preliminary due to small sample size, enable users to make judgements about quality within and between facilities. Thus it is recommended the ResCareQA be adopted for wider use...|$|R

MÉTODOS: De novembro de 2002 a outubro de 2003 foram {{realizadas}} coletas mensais de imaturos de culicídeos em pneus-armadilha expostos por 15 dias em área urbana de Potim, Vale do Paraíba, SP, Brasil. Os imaturos foram criados em laboratório por 29 dias e identificados segundo espécie. A associação com temperatura, pluviosidade e umidade relativa do ar foram testadas utilizando-se correlações de <b>Spearman</b> (r <b>s).</b> As estatísticas descritivas foram apresentadas pela média e erro-padrão (EP) e nos testes foi utilizado alfa= 0, 05. RESULTADOS: Do total de 20. 727 imaturos coletados, 95, 3 % eram Ae. aegypti e 4, 7 % Ae. albopictus. A espécie Ae. aegypti esteve presente em todas as estações/meses do ano e Ae. albopictus somente de novembro a julho. As associações das espécies coletadas com fatores abióticos foram significantes em relação à temperatura máxima para Ae. aegypti (p= 0, 04) e Ae. albopictus (p= 0, 01), e pluviosidade (p= 0, 02) para esta última espécie. CONCLUSÕES: Ambas espécies apresentaram variação sazonal. Porém, Ae. aegypti esteve presente durante todo ano, com maiores quedas de densidade entre abril e maio e entre junho e julho. Ae. albopictus menos abundante, foi encontrado apenas de novembro a julho, com o pico em abril. A maior abundância de Ae. aegypti em relação à Ae. albopictus em área urbana mostrou maior capacidade de Ae. aegypti em colonizar pneus. A existência de tal criadouro no ambiente pode ser importante na manutenção e abundância de Ae. aegypti. OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} seasonal variation of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and {{to estimate the}} association between the species abundance and abiotic factors. METHODS: Tire-traps were kept {{for a period of}} 15 days monthly in an urban area of the city of Potim in the state of São Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, from November 2002 to October 2003. Samples of immature forms were followed up under laboratory conditions for 29 days and species were identified. The association between abundance and temperature, rainfall and air relative humidity was tested using <b>Spearman</b> correlations (r <b>s).</b> The descriptive statistics were presented by the average and the standard error (alpha= 0. 05). RESULTS: From a total of 20, 727 immatures collected, 95. 3 % were Ae. aegypti and 4. 7 %, Ae. albopictus. Ae. aegypti was found throughout the whole year while Ae. albopictus was found from November to July. The association between these species and abiotic factors was significant for Ae. aegypti (p= 0. 04) as for maximum temperature and for Ae. albopictus as for maximum temperature (p= 0. 01) and rainfall (p= 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Both species presented seasonal variation. However, Ae. aegypti was found throughout the whole year showing a decrease between April and May and June and July. Ae. albopictus, less abundant, was found only between November, 2002 and July, 2003 with a peak in April, 2003. The higher abundance of Ae. aegypti compared to Ae. albopictus in an urban area showed Ae. aegypti has greater capacity of colonizing tires. Such a breeding site in the environment may be important to the maintenance and abundance of Ae. aegypti...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Purpose It {{is vital}} to {{understand}} the associations between the medication event monitoring systems (MEMS) and self-reported questionnaires (SRQs) because both are often used to measure medication adherence and can produce different results. In addition, the economic implication of using alternative measures is important {{as the cost of}} electronic monitoring devices is not covered by insurance, while self-reports are the most practical and cost-effective method in the clinical settings. This meta-analysis examined the correlations of two measurements of medication adherence: MEMS and SRQs. Methods The literature search (1980 - 2009) used PubMed, OVID MEDLINE, PsycINFO (EBSCO), CINAHL (EBSCO), OVID HealthStar, EMBASE (Elsevier), and Cochrane Databases. Studies were included if the correlation coefficients [Pearson (r p) or <b>Spearman</b> (r <b>s)</b> ] between adherences measured by both MEMS and SRQs were available or could be calculated from other statistics in the articles. Data were independently abstracted in duplicate with standardized protocol and abstraction form including 1) first author's name; 2) year of publication; 3) disease status of participants; 4) sample size; 5) mean age (year); 6) duration of trials (month); 7) SRQ names if available; 8) adherence (%) measured by MEMS; 9) adherence (%) measured by SRQ; 10) correlation coefficient and relative information, including p-value, 95 % confidence interval (CI). A meta-analysis was conducted to pool the correlation coefficients using random-effect model. Results Eleven studies (N = 1, 684 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The mean of adherence measured by MEMS was 74. 9 % (range 53. 4 %- 92. 9 %), versus 84. 0 % by SRQ (range 68. 35 %- 95 %). The correlation between adherence measured by MEMS and SRQs ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 87. The pooled correlation coefficient for 11 studies was 0. 45 (p = 0. 001, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI]: 0. 34 - 0. 56). The subgroup meta-analysis on the seven studies reporting r p and four studies reporting r s reported the pooled correlation coefficient: 0. 46 (p = 0. 011, 95 % CI: 0. 33 - 0. 59) and 0. 43 (p = 0. 0038, 95 % CI: 0. 23 - 0. 64), respectively. No differences were found for other subgroup analyses. Conclusion Medication adherence measured by MEMS and SRQs tends to be at least moderately correlated, suggesting that SRQs give a good estimate of medication adherence. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Fear {{of falling}} (FOF) {{is common in}} Parkinson's disease (PD), and it is {{considered}} a vital aspect of comprehensive balance assessment in PD. FOF can be conceptualized differently. The Falls-Efficacy Scale (FES) assesses fall-related self-efficacy, whereas the Survey of Activities and Fear of Falling in the Elderly (SAFFE) assesses activity avoidance due {{to the risk of}} falling. This study aimed at investigating the validity and reliability of FES and SAFFE in people with PD. Methods Seventy-nine people with PD (mean age; 64 years, SD 7. 2) completed the Swedish version of FES(S), SAFFE and the physical functioning (PF) scale of the 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 36). FES(S) and SAFFE were administered twice, with an 8. 8 (SD 2. 3) days interval. Assumptions for summing item scores into total scores were examined and score reliability (Cronbach's alpha and test-retest reliability) were calculated. Construct validity was assessed by examining the pattern of <b>Spearman</b> correlations (r <b>s)</b> between the FES(S) /SAFFE and other variables, and by examining differences in FES(S) /SAFFE scores between fallers and non-fallers, genders, and between those reporting FOF and unsteadiness while turning. Results For both scales, item mean scores (and standard deviations) were roughly similar and corrected item-total correlations exceeded 0. 4. Reliabilities were ≥ 0. 87. FES(S) -scores correlated strongest (r s, - 0. 74, p s, - 0. 76, p s ≤ 0. 08). Experiencing falls, unsteadiness while turning, and FOF was associated with lower fall-related self-efficacy and higher activity avoidance. Conclusions This study provides initial support for the score reliability and validity of the FES(S) and SAFFE in people with PD. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background RNA-seq and {{microarray}} {{are the two}} popular methods {{employed for}} genome-wide transcriptome profiling. Current comparison {{studies have shown that}} transcriptome quantified by these two methods correlated well. However, none of them have addressed if they complement each other, considering the strengths and the limitations inherent with them. The pivotal requirement to address this question is the knowledge of a well known data set. In this regard, HrpX regulome from pathogenic bacteria serves as an ideal choice as the target genes of HrpX transcription factor are well studied due to their central role in pathogenicity. Results We compared the performance of RNA-seq and microarray in their ability to detect known HrpX target genes by profiling the transcriptome from the wild-type and the hrpX mutant strains of γ-Proteobacterium Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri. Our comparative analysis indicated that gene expression levels quantified by RNA-seq and microarray well-correlated both at absolute as well as relative levels (<b>Spearman</b> correlation-coefficient, r <b>s</b> > 0. 76). Further, the expression levels quantified by RNA-seq and microarray for the significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) also well-correlated with qRT-PCR based quantification (r s [*]=[*] 0. 58 to 0. 94). Finally, in addition to the 55 newly identified DEGs, 72 % of the already known HrpX target genes were detected by both RNA-seq and microarray, while, the remaining 28 % could only be detected by either one of the methods. Conclusions This study has significantly advanced our understanding of the regulome of the critical transcriptional factor HrpX. RNA-seq and microarray together provide a more comprehensive picture of HrpX regulome by uniquely identifying new DEGs. Our study demonstrated that RNA-seq and microarray complement each other in transcriptome profiling. </p...|$|R

Analisou-se a topografia de superfície do esmalte humano dividido em 3 grupos de idades (n = 45) e subdivididos em 2 subgrupos: I 1 V, não erupcionado na face vestibular; I 1 L, não erupcionado na face lingual; I 2 V, idade entre 20 e 40 anos na face vestibular; I 2 L, idade entre 20 e 40 anos na face lingual; I 3 V, idade entre 41 e 60 anos na face vestibular; e I 3 L, idade entre 41 e 60 anos na face lingual. As amostras foram metalizadas e analisadas em interferômetro a laser (Microfocus Expert IV). Os parâmetros de topografia considerados foram: média aritmética das alturas de picos e vales (Sa), desvio padrão das alturas de picos e vales (Sq), coeficiente de simetria (Ssk) e coeficiente de achatamento (Sk).

O coeficiente de achatamento (Sk) foi o único que apresentou correlação com a idade, associado à análise morfológica superficial por MEV, porém apenas as faces vestibular e lingual dos dentes não erupcionados apresentaram diferenças estatisticamente significante no parâmetro Sq (rugosidade quadrática média), enquanto que nenhuma diferença foi detectada nos demais valores de Sq e de Sa (rugosidade média). This study {{tested the}} hypothesis of that the surface topography of human enamel {{is influenced by the}} age and the face of the tooth organ. It was analyzed the human enamel surface topography divided in 3 groups of ages (n = 45) and subdivided in 2 sub-groups: I 1 V, not erupted in the vestibular face; I 1 L, not erupted in the lingual face; I 2 V, age between 20 and 40 years in the vestibular face; I 2 L, age between 20 and 40 years in the lingual face; I 3 V, age between 41 and 60 years in the vestibular face; and I 3 L, age between 41 and 60 years in the lingual face. The samples had been metallized and analyzed in laser interferometer (Microfocus Expert IV). The considered parameters of topography were: arithmetic mean of the heights of peaks and valleys (Sa), standard deviation of the heights of peaks and valleys (Sq), skewness (Ssk) and kurtosis (Sk). The values had been submitted to statistical analysis and applied the Kruskal-Wallis test, the Wilcoxon test and <b>Spearman</b> <b>s</b> correlation (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were: (1) to characterise the exposure of non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS) in a vehicle using biomarkers, (2) to describe {{the time course of}} the biomarkers over 24 h, and (3) {{to examine the relationship between}} tobacco biomarkers and airborne concentrations of SHS markers. Methods: Eight non-smokers were individually exposed to SHS in cars with fully open front windows and closed back windows over an hour from a smoker who smoked three cigarettes at 20 min intervals. The non-smokers sat in the back seat on the passenger side, while the smoker sat in the driver's seat. Plasma cotinine and urine cotinine, 3 -hydroxycotinine (3 HC) and 4 - (methylnitrosoamino) -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanol (NNAL) were compared in samples taken at baseline (BL) and several time-points after exposure. Nicotine, particulate matter (PM 2. 5) and carbon monoxide (CO) were measured inside and outside the vehicle and ventilation rates in the cars were measured. Results: Average plasma cotinine and the molar sum of urine cotinine and 3 HC (COT+ 3 HC) increased four-fold, urine cotinine increased six-fold and urine NNAL increased ~ 7 times compared to BL biomarker levels. Plasma cotinine, urine COT+ 3 HC and NNAL peaked at 4 - 8 h post-exposure while urine cotinine peaked within 4 h. Plasma cotinine was significantly correlated to PM 2. 5 (<b>Spearman</b> correlation r <b>s</b> = 0. 94) and CO (r s = 0. 76) but not to air nicotine. The correlations between urine biomarkers, cotinine, COT+ 3 HC and NNAL, and air nicotine, PM 2. 5 and CO were moderate but nonsignificant (r s range = 0. 31 - 0. 60). Conclusions: Brief SHS exposure in cars resulted in substantial increases in levels of tobacco biomarkers in non-smokers. For optimal characterisation of SHS exposure, tobacco biomarkers should be measured within 4 - 8 h post-exposure. Additional studies are needed to better describe the relationship between tobacco biomarkers and environmental markers of SHS...|$|R
40|$|A utilização de terapia medicamentosa em crianças infectadas pelo HIV (HIV+) vem promovendo a diminuição na prevalência de manifestações bucais em tecidos moles ao longo dos anos. Entretanto, observa-se uma constância na experiência de cárie e gengivite desta população, sobretudo devido à influência crônica de alguns fatores envolvidos no processo da infecção pelo HIV, como uso prolongado de medicamentos líquidos açucarados, dieta rica em carboidratos e repetidos episódios de internação. Assim, o objetivo do presente estudo foi avaliar se a qualidade e quantidade de biofilme representam um fator importante na atividade da doença cárie e gengivite neste grupo em especial. Após exame do biofilme (índice de biofilme; Ribeiro 23, 2000), da atividade de cárie e gengivite de 56 crianças, de 0 a 14 anos, pacientes com diagnóstico definitivo de infecção pelo HIV, observou-se que somente 7 (12, 5 %) não apresentavam biofilme visível clinicamente e 33 (58, 9 %) apresentavam gengivite, com, em média, 4, 44 superfícies com sangramento. Quanto à doença cárie, 73, 2 % das crianças apresentavam lesões cariosas ativas. Verificou-se ainda a correlação entre o índice de biofilme, o estado gengival e a atividade das lesões cariosas (teste de correlação de <b>Spearman,</b> r <b>s</b> = + 0, 57 e r s = + 0, 49, respectivamente). Conclui-se, que nas crianças HIV+ avaliadas, a qualidade e quantidade de biofilme sobre a superfície dental representam um importante fator na etiologia da atividade das doenças cárie e gengivite, podendo e devendo este ser trabalhado para que seja possível restabelecer a saúde bucal destas crianças. The {{utilization}} of medicines to treat HIV-infected children has been promoting {{a decrease in}} the prevalence of soft-tissue oral lesions, as years pass by. In contrast, it has been observed that the experience of caries and gingivitis is constant in this population, mostly because of the chronic influence of some factors involved in the HIV-infection process, such as the chronic {{utilization of}} sweetened liquid medicines and carbohydrate-enriched diet, as well as frequent episodes of hospitalization. So, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate if the quality and quantity of biofilm are important factors in the activity of dental caries and gingivitis, also in this special group. After examination of the biofilm (biofilm index - Ribeiro 23, 2000), the activity of caries and gingivitis was assessed in 56 children, aging from 0 to 14 years, who were patients with definitive diagnosis of HIV infection. It was observed that only 7 subjects (12. 5 %) did not present with clinically visible biofilm, and 33 (58. 9 %) presented with gingivitis, with the average of 4. 44 bleeding sites. As to dental caries, 73. 2 % of the patients presented with active carious lesions. A strong correlation was verified between Biofilm Index, gingival status and active carious lesions (Spearman’s correlation test, r s = + 0. 57 and r s = + 0. 49, respectively). It was concluded that, also in HIV-infected children, the quality and quantity of biofilm over the dental surfaces are important etiologic factors related to the activity of caries and gingivitis.

40|$|Over a decade, {{declines in}} honey bee colonies have raised {{worldwide}} concerns. Several potentially contributing {{factors have been}} investigated, e. g. parasites, diseases, and pesticides. Neonicotinoid pesticides have received much attention due to their intensive use in crop protection, and their adverse effects on many levels of honey bee physiology led the European Union to ban these compounds. Due to their neuronal target, a receptor expressed throughout the insect nervous system, studies have focused mainly on neuroscience and behaviour. Through the Geometric Framework of nutrition, we investigated effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on survival, food consumption and sucrose sensitivity of honey bees (Apis mellifera). Thiamethoxam did not affect protein and carbohydrate intake, but decreased responses to high concentrations of sucrose. Interestingly, when bees ate fixed unbalanced diets, dietary protein facilitated better sucrose detection. Both thiamethoxam and dietary protein influenced survival. These findings suggest that, {{in the presence of}} a pesticide and unbalanced food, honey bee health may be severely challenged. Consequences for foraging efficiency and colony activity, cornerstones of honey bee health, are also discussed. S 1 Fig. Daily nutrient intake is influenced by the amount of dietary protein, but not by the THX pesticide dose. The panels show the effect of THX doses among different diets. The top panel is the choice experiment, where bees were able to regulate their nutrient intake. The four panels below the line represent the no-choice experiment with the four different fixed diets (indicated at the top-left corner of each panel). For each panel, days are indicated on the x-axis, from day 1 to day 14, while the four THX doses are represented on the y-axis. Nutrient intake (in mg/bee) is colour-scaled. Maximal intake is achieved during the choice experiment, around day 6, independent of THX dose. The patterns of daily consumption of P:C ratios 1 : 30 and 1 : 3 diets are similar to those in the choice experiment, although the maximum intake is around day 7. In contrast, when dietary protein is low or absent, daily consumption is reduced, especially on the second week. S 1 Table. Statistical data. (A) Choice experiment. (B) No-Choice experiment–THX Dose effect. (C) No-Choice experiment–Dietary protein effect. <b>S</b> 2 Table. <b>Spearman</b> correlations. <b>S</b> 3 Table. Cumulative consumption and details of the different amount of nutrient eaten during the Choice Experiment. Every values are in mg/bee ±s. e. m., except for the P:C ratio columns. The “Cumulative Consumption” column is the same as the last column in Table 1. Honey bees were offered the choice between two unbalanced diets, differing in their P:C ratios (1 : 3 and 1 : 30). First, consumption of each diet is assessed and proportions of protein and carbohydrate are calculated. The total protein consumption is the addition of the protein parts eaten from the 1 : 3 diet and the 1 : 30 diet; the same goes for the carbohydrate part. P:C ratios are calculated by dividing the total protein consumption by the total carbohydrate consumption. FJD is supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the University of Pretoria.

40|$|Objectives: Skin notations {{are used}} as a hazard {{identification}} tool to flag chemicals associated with a potential risk related to transdermal penetration. The transparency and rigorousness of the skin notation assignment process have recently been questioned. We compared different approaches proposed as criteria for these notations {{as a starting point}} for improving and systematizing current practice. Methods: In this study, skin notations, dermal acute lethal dose 50 in mammals (LD 50 s) and two dermal risk indices derived from previously published work were compared using the lists of Swiss maximum allowable concentrations (MACs) and threshold limit values (TLVs) from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). The indices were both based on quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) estimation of transdermal fluxes. One index compared the cumulative dose received through skin given specific exposure surface and duration to that received through lungs following inhalation 8 h at the MAC or TLV. The other index estimated the blood level increase caused by adding skin exposure to the inhalation route at kinetic steady state. Dermal-to-other route ratios of LD 50 were calculated as secondary indices of dermal penetrability. Results: The working data set included 364 substances. Depending on the subdataset, agreement between the Swiss and ACGIH skin notations varied between 82 and 87 %. Chemicals with a skin notation were more likely to have higher dermal risk indices and lower dermal LD 50 than chemicals without a notation (probabilities between 60 and 70 %). The risk indices, based on cumulative dose and kinetic steady state, respectively, appeared proportional up to a constant independent of chemical-specific properties. They agreed well with dermal LD 50 <b>s</b> (<b>Spearman</b> correlation coefficients − 0. 42 to − 0. 43). Dermal-to-other routes LD 50 ratios were moderately associated with QSAR-based transdermal fluxes (Spearman correlation coefficients − 0. 2 to − 0. 3). Conclusions: The plausible but variable relationship between current skin notations and the different approaches tested confirm the need to improve current skin notations. QSAR-based risk indices and dermal toxicity data might be successfully integrated in a systematic alternative to current skin notations for detecting chemicals associated with potential dermal risk in the workplac...|$|R
40|$|I {{investigated}} {{the role of}} extra-pair paternity on use of public information and the interaction between public information and personal information for patch fidelity decisions. It is unknown if songbirds use public information {{about the number of}} conspecific fledglings for patch fidelity decisions when extra-pair paternity is uncommon. I tested if probability of patch fidelity was associated with (1) number of fledglings in adjacent territories (public information), and (2) number of fledglings raised with a social mate (personal information). I used logistic regression to predict probability of patch fidelity of males and females based on the 2 uncorrelated predictor variables (<b>Spearman?s</b> rank correlation, <b>S</b> = 21895. 28, n = 50, P = 0. 723, r = ? 0. 051). I monitored patch fidelity of 107 territories, counted the number of fledglings in each territory, and assessed parentage of 102 young from 36 nests for white-eyed vireos (Vireo griseus) from 2008 ? 2010 in a 100 ha patch of woodland in central Texas, USA. I excluded the social male as the father of 3 of the 102 young and did not exclude any of the social females as the mother with parentage analysis using 6 microsatellite loci. The number of fledglings in adjacent territories was not a good predictor of probability of patch fidelity for males (beta 1 = 0. 166, df = 35, P = 0. 247, Nagelkerke?s R 2 = 0. 054) or females (beta 1 = 0. 121, df = 17, P = 0. 670, Nagelkerke?s R 2 = 0. 016). The number of fledglings raised with a social mate was also not a good predictor of probability of patch fidelity for males (beta 1 = ? 0. 296, df = 43, P = 0. 360, Nagelkerke?s R 2 = 0. 029), whereas it was a good predictor for females (beta 1 = 1. 281, df = 21, P = 0. 048, Nagelkerke?s R 2 = 0. 409). The dominant ecological concepts for explaining site fidelity in songbirds, win-stay lose-switch (based on personal reproductive success with a social mate) and public information, did not predict probability of patch fidelity well for male white-eyed vireos. The win-stay lose-switch model, but not public information was a good predictor of probability of patch fidelity for females. My results suggest that use of public information may depend on frequency of extra-pair paternity. Males may primarily use other information for patch fidelity decisions beyond reproductive success of conspecifics for patch fidelity decisions in some circumstances. My results support the need to ensure high levels of nesting success for females to return and maintain populations in areas managed for breeding songbirds for conservation efforts to be successful...|$|R

De Smet, I. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2015 Journal of Experimental Botany 66175367 - 5374 <![CDATA[In the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, over 1000 putative genes encoding small, presumably secreted, signalling peptides can be recognized. However, a major obstacle in identifying the function of genes encoding small signalling peptides is the limited number of available loss-of-function mutants. To overcome this, a promising new tool, antagonistic peptide technology, was recently developed. Here, this antagonistic peptide technology was tested on selected CLE peptides and the related IDA peptide and its usefulness in the context of studies of peptide function discussed. Based on the analyses, it was concluded that the antagonistic peptide approach is not the ultimate means to overcome redundancy or lack of loss-of-function lines. However, information collected using antagonistic peptide approaches (in the broad sense) can be very useful, but these approaches do not work in all cases and require a deep insight on the interaction between the ligand and its receptor to be successful. This, as well as peptide ligand structure considerations, should be taken into account before ordering a wide range of synthetic peptide variants and/or generating transgenic plants...|$|R
