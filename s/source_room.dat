40|$|Airborne {{transmission}} is a main spread mode of respiratory infectious diseases, whose frequent epidemic has brought serious social burden. Identifying possible routes of the airborne transmission and predicting the potential infection risk are meaningful for infectious disease control. In the present study, an internal spread route between horizontal adjacent flats induced by air infiltration was investigated. On-site measurements were conducted, and tracer gas technique was employed. Two measurement scenarios, closed window mode and open window mode, were compared. Using the calculated {{air change rate}} and mass fraction, the cross-infection risk was estimated using the Wells-Riley model. It found that tracer gas concentrations in receptor rooms are one order lower than the <b>source</b> <b>room,</b> and the infection risks are also one order lower. Opening windows results in larger air change rate on the one hand, but higher mass fraction on the other hand. Higher mass fraction not necessarily results in higher infection risk as the pathogen concentration in the <b>source</b> <b>room</b> is reduced by the higher air change rate. In the present study, opening windows could significantly reduce the infection risk of the index room but slightly reduce the risks in receptor rooms. The mass fraction of air originated from the index room to the receptor units could be 0. 28 and the relative cross-infection risk through the internal transmission route could be 9 %, which are higher than the external spread through single-sided window flush. The study implicates that the horizontal transmission route induced by air infiltration should not be underestimated. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports {{results from}} a {{research}} project that examines flanking sound transmission involving lightweight gypsum board walls using SEA. There are multiple transmission paths between any two gypsum board surfaces coupled by the junction. This is because the gypsum board leaves of a wall are often resiliently mounted to the studs, which forms a cavity and transverse velocity {{is not the same}} {{on either side of the}} wall. Often the assumption is made that power flow occurs along every path independently and the power balance method is applied to estimate the flanking transmission along every path independently. This approach overestimates the power flow along each of the single paths, since their magnitude is a complex function of the wall structure. However, two different approaches of application of the power balance method to estimate the total flanking sound transmission between two rooms from measured surface velocity level differences between two leaves are presented in this paper. One is a common approach that was already applied in earlier work to identify the relative importance of the different paths that might contribute to the overall transmission at the regarded junction. The velocity level difference is measured between the surfaces of the flanking walls that are exposed two the source and receiving room respectively where the first is excited structurally. In the second, the modified measurement approach, the surface velocity of the wall that is not exposed to the <b>source</b> <b>room</b> is measured instead to get some benefit in predicting the structural response of this leaf to airborne excitation in the <b>source</b> <b>room.</b> The results of the methods are compared and the advantages as well as the disadvantages of both methods are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{two main}} {{standard}} methods for measuring sound transmission loss using the two-room method-ASTM E 901 and ISO 140 - 32 - only require that measurements {{be made in}} one direction. One of the rooms is designated as the <b>source</b> <b>room,</b> the other automatically is the receiving room. Neither standard gives any guidance on how to select the role for each room in most cases. Users may choose to test in two directions {{but it is not}} mandatory. At low frequencies the room modal response influences the measured transmission loss values, and so is a factor in determining the reproducibility of the two-room test methods. Measurements made in both directions 3 at the National Research Council showed differences in transmission loss at low frequencies that were large enough to give different STC 4, or Rw 5 ratings. This observation caused us to routinely measure transmission loss in both directions in our test facilities. This paper presents the findings from the data collected. 2.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how the effectiveness of portable air cleaners (ACs) against tobacco smoke is influenced by the clean air delivery rate (CADR), the location of the AC in relation to the pollution source and the apartment structure.

Ultrafine particles (UFP) exposure in a room without tobacco smoking (clean room) could be much less than in the <b>source</b> <b>room</b> if these rooms were not directly connected with each other (but indirectly connected via doors open to other rooms). Operating the AC in one of the rooms without cigarette smoking could develop a partly isolated clean environment.

40|$|An {{essential}} {{step towards}} improving sound insulation is a reliable means of quantifying the performance. However, {{for various reasons}} sound insulation measurements at low frequencies are associated with relatively high uncertainty and wide variance values. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop a method of sound insulation measurement which complements the standard ISO 140 measurement methods by providing improved accuracy at low frequencies. In this paper {{part of the problem is}} considered, namely the measurement of power radiated into the receiver room. The ‘peak envelope method’ is based on mode theory and the measurement employs a pair of microphones in the receiver room and a calibrated volume velocity source. No reverberation time measurements are required. The theory is outlined and computer simulations and trial measurements are carried out in order to validate the theory. Good agreement in numerical and experimental validation is demonstrated. We conclude that the peak envelope method is suitable for the measurement of radiated sound power at modal frequencies where ISO 140 methods are poorly adapted. In order to obtain transmission loss, a measure of incident power in the <b>source</b> <b>room</b> will also be required, which will be the subject of future works...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} models {{based on}} Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) to predict bending wave vibration in heavyweight buildings from structure-borne sound {{sources such as}} machinery. These sources tend to inject most power in the low- and mid-frequency ranges where the walls and floors have low mode counts and low modal overlap for which calculated Coupling Loss Factors (CLFs) from semi-infinite plate theory can be in error. For machinery {{it is necessary to}} predict vibration on walls/floors that are remote from the <b>source</b> <b>room.</b> In this situation, propagation across successive structural junctions causes spatial filtering of the wave field and the assumption of a diffuse field in each plate subsystem breaks down. The predictive approach described in the European Standard EN 12354 uses SEA path analysis which assumes that transmission is dominated by first-order paths. However the feasibility of extending the concept of path analysis to walls and floors of rooms that are distant from the source room(i. e. not adjacent) is unknown. These issues are addressed in the thesis. The feasibility of SEA path analysis was assessed by quantifying the total contribution to receiver subsystem energy from paths containing specified numbers of CLFs. For receiving subsystems which are attached directly to the source subsystem, the EN 12354 approach was found to underestimate the energy levels. For rooms remote from the <b>source</b> <b>room,</b> path analysis was found to significantly underestimate the vibration of the walls/floors which form the receiver room. Alternative approaches to improve predictions in large heavyweight buildings were assessed through comparison with Monte-Carlo Finite Element Method (MCFEM) models which were validated on a small heavyweight building. Matrix SEA was used with CLFs calculated for L-, T- and X-junctions using analytical models for rectangular plates to try and incorporate modal features. For isolated junctions, there was good agreement with MCFEM but in large buildings. However, it was unable to predict the peaks and troughs in the vibration response to one-third octave band accuracy although it can estimate the envelope response for plates that are directly connected to the source plate. In general, matrix SEA using finite plate theory CLFs does not improve the prediction in one-third octave bands when the statistical mode count is less than unity. Ray tracing was therefore investigated which showed that the angular distribution of power incident on the plate edges differed significantly from a diffuse field. Computationally efficient ray tracing was then developed for inclusion in Advanced SEA (ASEA) models to account for indirect coupling between plate subsystems. ASEA gave significant improvements over matrix SEA when there were large numbers of structural junctions between the source and receiving plates...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLarge {{reverberation}} {{rooms are}} generally prescribed for the acoustic characterization of materials. Diffuse-field absorption properties are measured in a reverberation room, while transmission loss properties {{can be measured}} between a reverberation <b>source</b> <b>room</b> and an anechoic receiving room. The large volumes needed (ASTM standards require 80 m 3) make the building of such rooms impractical, and transforming existing anechoic rooms in transmission suites is generally impossible. In the present work, a mobile reverberation cabin is developed and placed inside an existing anechoic room for acoustic material characterization. Light materials (plywood and wood) are chosen to enable easy assembly, disassembly and transportation of the cabin. An external thick layer of open-cell foam is used {{in order to maintain}} the anechoic properties of the surrounding room.

40|$|In this paper, a {{modification}} of the diffusion model for room acoustics is proposed to account for sound transmission between two rooms, a <b>source</b> <b>room</b> and an adjacent room, which are coupled through a partition wall. A system of two diffusion equations, one for each room, together {{with a set of}} two boundary conditions, one for the partition wall and one for the other walls of a room, is obtained and numerically solved. The modified diffusion model is validated by numerical comparisons with the statistical theory for several coupled-room configurations by varying the coupling area surface, the absorption coefficient of each room, and the volume of the adjacent room. An experimental comparison is also carried out for two coupled classrooms. The modified diffusion model results agree very well with both the statistical theory and the experimental data. The diffusion model can then be used {{as an alternative to the}} statistical theory, especially when the statistical theory is not applicable, that is, when the reverberant sound field is not diffuse. Moreover, the diffusion model allows the prediction of the spatial distribution of sound energy within each coupled room, while the statistical theory gives only one sound level for each room.
