He also had a substance abuse problem, and he acknowledged after his retirement that he never pitched without the use of drugs.

5|$|In December 1988, the Ramones {{recorded}} {{material for}} their eleventh studio album, Brain Drain; co-produced by Beauvoir, Rey, and Bill Laswell. However, the bass parts were done by Daniel Rey and the Dictators' Andy Shernoff. Dee Dee Ramone would only record the additional vocals {{on the album}} citing that {{the other members of}} the band (including himself) were going through personal troubles and changes to the point where he didn't want to be in the band anymore. After the band finished their Halfway to Sanity tour in February 1989, Dee Dee became <b>sober</b> <b>and</b> left the band.|$|E

5|$|Vargas Llosa's fourth major novel, The War of the End of the World (La guerra del fin del mundo), was {{published}} in 1981 and was his first attempt at a historical novel. This work initiated a radical change in Vargas Llosa's style towards themes such as messianism and irrational human behaviour. It recreates the War of Canudos, an incident in 19th-century Brazil in which an armed millenarian cult held off a siege by the national army for months. As in Vargas Llosa's earliest work, this novel carries a <b>sober</b> <b>and</b> serious theme, and its tone is dark. Vargas Llosa's bold exploration of humanity's propensity to idealize violence, and his account of a man-made catastrophe brought on by fanaticism on all sides, earned the novel substantial recognition.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 18 he {{was given}} a {{separate}} establishment, and in dramatic contrast with his prosaic, scandal-free father, threw himself with zest into a life of dissipation and wild extravagance involving heavy drinking and numerous mistresses and escapades. He was a witty conversationalist, drunk or <b>sober,</b> <b>and</b> showed good, but grossly expensive, taste in decorating his palace. The Prince of Wales turned 21 in 1783, and obtained a grant of £60,000 (equivalent to £ today) from Parliament and an annual income of £50,000 (equivalent to £ today) from his father. It was far too little for his needs – the stables alone cost £31,000 a year. He then established his residence in Carlton House, where he lived a profligate life. Animosity developed between the prince and his father, who desired more frugal behaviour {{on the part of the}} heir apparent. The King, a political conservative, was also alienated by the prince's adherence to Charles James Fox and other radically inclined politicians.|$|E
5|$|Rainie {{returns to}} Walford in 2010 and tells Max she {{is clean and}} <b>sober,</b> <b>and</b> asks Max for Tanya's phone number. Tanya's daughter, Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), wants Rainie to stay and Max agrees. She steals money out of Max's sister Carol Jackson's (Lindsey Coulson) purse, which she uses to buy crack cocaine. Max catches her with the drugs and throws her out. She starts looking for her drugs where a drunken Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) approaches, finds Rainie's crack cocaine and is tempted to try some after she says it helps her block out her memories. Phil and Rainie get high at Phil's home. Rainie goes to get more drugs when Phil steals money from The Queen Victoria public house, but is mugged by a drug dealer. Phil's girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) offers {{to help him get}} clean but throws Rainie out of the house, calling her pathetic.|$|E

5|$|With {{lead singer}} Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) no longer part of New Directions, the McKinley High glee club, {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) grows {{concerned about the}} club's forthcoming performance at Invitationals. He discovers that April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth), {{a member of the}} club during his own high school days, never actually graduated, and convinces her to return to school in order to get her diploma and join the glee club. Having failed to achieve her Broadway dreams, April is now an alcoholic, and goes about winning the favor of the existing club members by unconventional means, including getting Kurt (Chris Colfer) drunk and teaching Mercedes (Amber Riley) and Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) to shoplift. After guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) warns Will that April is corrupting the students, Will asks April to become <b>sober,</b> <b>and</b> she vows to do so.|$|E
5|$|Calvin's {{theology}} caused controversy. Pierre Caroli, a Protestant {{minister in}} Lausanne accused Calvin {{as well as}} Viret and Farel of Arianism in 1536. Calvin defended his beliefs on the Trinity in Confessio de Trinitate propter calumnias P. Caroli. In 1551 Jérôme-Hermès Bolsec, a physician in Geneva, attacked Calvin's doctrine of predestination and accused him of making God the author of sin. Bolsec was banished from the city, and after Calvin's death, he wrote a biography which severely maligned Calvin's character. In the following year, Joachim Westphal, a Gnesio-Lutheran pastor in Hamburg, condemned Calvin and Zwingli as heretics in denying the eucharistic doctrine of the union of Christ's body with the elements. Calvin's Defensio sanae et orthodoxae doctrinae de sacramentis (A Defence of the <b>Sober</b> <b>and</b> Orthodox Doctrine of the Sacrament) was his response in 1555. In 1556 , a Dutch dissident, held a public disputation with Calvin {{during his visit to}} Frankfurt, in which Velsius defended free will against Calvin's doctrine of predestination. Following the execution of Servetus, a close associate of Calvin, Sebastian Castellio, broke with him {{on the issue of the}} treatment of heretics. In Castellio's Treatise on Heretics (1554), he argued for a focus on Christ's moral teachings in place of the vanity of theology, and he afterward developed a theory of tolerance based on biblical principles.|$|E

25|$|Painting {{was one of}} {{the more}} {{distinguishing}} factors of the Portuguese Renaissance, being one of the more contrasting arts to the other Renaissances of Europe. Painting in the Portuguese Renaissance was largely <b>sober</b> <b>and</b> almost exclusively religious, being more inline with the Northern Renaissance in nature, not following the pomp and excess of the Italian and Spanish Renaissances.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-Joseon period, the winglike bracket form {{appeared}} (an {{example is}} the Yongnyongjon Hall of Jongmyo, Seoul), which, according to some authors, better suited the peninsula's poor economic situation that resulted from repetitive invasions. Only in buildings of importance like palaces or sometimes temples (Tongdosa, for instance) were the multicluster brackets still used. Korean Confucianism also led to more <b>sober</b> <b>and</b> simple solutions.|$|E

25|$|In August 1882, Jacob Philippi (c. 1835–1892) {{purchased}} a {{tract of land}} on Fort Moore Hill and built a beer garden. He had started the New York Brewery, the first brewery in Los Angeles, and had owned a saloon in the Temple Block {{in the center of}} town. On the summit of the hill he had a rambling structure erected, covering much of the ground with wide galleries, and for many years following, as the story went, local inhabitants of Los Angeles would climb the hill <b>sober</b> <b>and</b> roll down drunk.|$|E
25|$|However, the Patagonian giant frenzy was to {{die down}} {{substantially}} {{only a few}} years later, when some more <b>sober</b> <b>and</b> analytical accounts were published. In 1773 John Hawkesworth published on behalf of the Admiralty a compendium of noted English southern-hemisphere explorers' journals, including that of James Cook and John Byron. In this publication, drawn from their official logs, {{it became clear that the}} people Byron's expedition had encountered were no taller than , very tall but by no means giants. Interest soon subsided, although awareness of and belief in the myth persisted in some quarters even up into the 20th century.|$|E

It was a disappointing turnout: all but John <b>Sober</b> <b>and</b> the hatter Joseph Stretch (son of Peter Stretch), {{who later became}} a Pennsylvania assemblyman, were officers. The library now had eleven paid-up members. Joseph Stretch and his {{brothers}} provided half of the original capital to build Pennsylvania Hospital, another of Benjamin Franklin's projects.|$|E

25|$|Shinyo-Togyo Shinji (May 5): A {{festival in}} which {{portable}} shrine (mikoshi) is {{carried in a}} formal procession to the Western Gate, where ceremonies and prayers {{for the security of}} the Imperial Palace are performed in the open air. In the Meiji period and Taisho period, this procession moved in <b>sober</b> <b>and</b> solemn silence. The ceremony at the gate was brief, lasting only 20 minutes; and then the mikoshi and its attendants returned into the Shrine precincts. Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa provided a new mikoshi and a complete set of robes and other accouterments for this festival on the occasion of repairs to the shrine in the 1457-1459 (Chōroku 1-3).|$|E
25|$|Sangster {{promptly}} made Edward Turner head of {{the automotive}} division which as well as Daimler and Carbodies (London Taxicab manufacturers) included Ariel, Triumph, and BSA motorcycles. Turner designed the lightweight hemi head Daimler 2.5 & 4.5 Litre V8 Engines. The small engine was used to power a production version of an apprentice's exercise, the very flexible Dart and the larger engine installed in the Majestic Major, a relabelled Majestic. Under Sangster Daimler's vehicles became a little less <b>sober</b> <b>and</b> more performance oriented. The Majestic Major proved an agile high-speed cruiser on the new motorways. Bill Boddy described the SP250 as unlikely to stir the memories of such ghosts as haunt the tree-lined avenues near Sandringham, Balmoral and Windsor Castle.|$|E
25|$|Hogg did {{not express}} much admiration for Shelley's poetry in the book. Many readers {{inferred}} from {{his description of}} Shelley that Hogg viewed him as a lady's man who was often irresponsible. Another irritation to many was that Hogg often boasted about himself in the book. He attempted to present himself as a <b>sober</b> <b>and</b> serious friend to an often foolish Percy Shelley. The book contained many descriptions of Shelley breaking appointments, borrowing money {{that he could not}} repay, and fabricating odd stories. Hogg did not mention the atheism that he shared with Percy Shelley, fearing the effect that this disclosure could have on his reputation. He went to great lengths in the book to portray himself as conservative and loyal to the traditions of England.|$|E
