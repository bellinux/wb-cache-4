In South Canterbury, long-tailed bats shelter during the day in the hollow branches, which would once have provided nesting holes for many birds.|$|E
5|$|As {{the postwar}} years yielded to the Gilded Age, Troy's {{prosperity}} continued. The wealth created by its industries built {{some of the}} city's most notable Victorian buildings. Frederick Clarke Withers designed First Street's Rice Building in 1871, a five-story flatiron-shaped building representative of his Victorian Gothic style. The Cannon Building got a contemporary mansard roof after two fires. Cummings' 1870 Congregation Berith Sholom Temple on Third Street is among the oldest synagogue buildings still <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, the oldest Reform synagogue in New York, {{and one of the}} most significant religious buildings in the district from this period.
