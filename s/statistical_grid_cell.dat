40|$|Statistical {{downscaling}} has mainly {{been used}} for site (point) scales to provide daily rainfall series for climate change impact studies. The objectives {{of this study are}} to compare three methods of applying statistical downscaling to catchment rainfall and evaluating their hydrological response with a hydrological model: (a) statistically downscaling to sites and then interpolating to gridded rainfall which is accumulated to catchment average rainfall; (b) statistically downscaling to catchment average rainfall directly; and (c) <b>statistical</b> downscaling to <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> and then accumulating to catchment average rainfall. Results indicate that statistical downscaling can be successfully applied at catchment average and <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> scales. All three methods of application performed similarly for a range of rainfall characteristics, with directly downscaled catchment average rainfall producing a relatively better result for extreme daily rainfall indices. However, hydrological simulation indicated that the direct downscaling of catchment average rainfall did not have any advantages over the other two downscaling application methods in terms of the runoff statistics evaluated. In addition, all three methods of downscaling application could simulate the spatial correlation of daily and annual runoff across the nine focus catchments investigated. The advantages and limitations of applying statistical downscaling to the assessment of hydrological response to climate change are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Discharge {{can be estimated}} from remotely sensed floodplain and channel inundation area, but there is currently no method that can be automatically extended to many rivers. We examined whether automated monitoring is feasible by statistically relating inundation estimates from moderate to coarse (> 0. 058) resolution remote sensing to monthly station discharge records. Inundation extents were derived from optical MODIS data and passive microwave sensors, and compared to monthly discharge records from over 8000 gauging stations and satellite altimetry observations for 442 reaches of large rivers. An automated <b>statistical</b> method selected <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> to construct ‘‘satellite gauging reaches’’ (SGRs). MODIS SGRs were generally more accurate than passive microwave SGRs, but there were complementary strengths. The rivers widely varied in size, regime, and morphology. As expected performance was low (R 0. 6. The best results (R> 0. 9) were obtained for large unregulated lowland rivers, particularly in tropical and boreal regions. Relatively poor results were obtained in arid regions, where flow pulses are few and recede rapidly, and in temperate regions, where many rivers are modified and contained. While discharge variations produce clear changes in inundated area and gauge records are available {{for part of the}} satellite record, SGRs can retrieve monthly river discharge values back to around 1998 and up to present.

40|$|The entorhinal-hippocampal system plays {{a crucial}} role in spatial {{cognition}} and navigation. Since the discovery of <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> in layer II of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), several types of models have been proposed to explain their development and operation; namely, continuous attractor network models, oscillatory interference models, and self-organizing map (SOM) models. Recent experiments revealing the in vivo intracellular signatures of <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> (Domnisoru et al., 2013; Schmidt-Heiber & Hausser, 2013), the primarily inhibitory recurrent connectivity of <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> (Couey et al., 2013; Pastoll et al., 2013), and the topographic organization of <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> within anatomically overlapping modules of multiple spatial scales along the dorsoventral axis of MEC (Stensola et al., 2012) provide strong constraints and challenges to existing <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> models. This article provides a computational explanation for how MEC cells can emerge through learning with <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> properties in modular structures. Within this SOM model, <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> with different rates of temporal integration learn modular properties with different spatial scales. Model <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> learn in response to inputs from multiple scales of directionally-selective stripe cells (Krupic et al., 2012; Mhatre et al., 2012) that perform path integration of the linear velocities that are experienced during navigation. Slower rates of <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> temporal integration support learned associations with stripe cells of larger scales. The explanatory and predictive capabilities of the three types of <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> models are comparatively analyzed in light of recent data to illustrate how the SOM model overcomes problems that other types of models have not yet handled...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{climate models}} rely on couplers. Each {{complete}} climate model is broken into different sub-models (oceanic, atmospheric, [...] .), each one {{working on a}} different grid. The coupler brings these models together and interpolates the physical quantities between the grids. However, neither the coupler nor sometimes the sub-models themselves know precisely the <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> edges. They only know the <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> corners (vertices) and the true <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> areas. Thus, the coupler has to make assumptions about the <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> edges in order to compute the <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> intersections. For first-order schemes, the most straightforward way to interpolate scalar quantities is to directly use these approximate <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> intersections, that don' take the true <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> areas into account. It is the method used in the "conservative" regridding option implemented in the widely used spherical interpolation package SCRIP. We show that is doesn't preserve integrals in the general case, whether the coupler using the SCRIP-generated weights transmits directly the intensive quantity, or its extensive counterpart (that is the same quantity multiplied by the true area of the individual source <b>grid</b> <b>cell).</b> We show how to modify the interpolation scheme to preserve integrals in the general case.

40|$|Firing {{fields of}} <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> in medial entorhinal cortex show {{compression}} or expansion after manipulations {{of the location}} of environmental barriers. This compression or expansion could be selective for individual <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> modules with particular properties of spatial scaling. We present a model for differences in the response of modules to barrier location that arise from different mechanisms for the influence of visual features on the computation of location that drives <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> firing patterns. These differences could arise from differences {{in the position of}} visual features within the visual field. When location was computed from the movement of visual features on the ground plane (optic flow) in the ventral visual field, this resulted in <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> spatial firing that was not sensitive to barrier location in modules mod-eled with small spacing between <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> firing fields. In contrast, when location was com-puted from static visual features on walls of barriers, i. e. in the more dorsal visual field, this resulted in <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> spatial firing that compressed or expanded based on the barrier loca-tions in modules modeled with large spacing between <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> firing fields.

40|$|Different {{models have}} been able to account for {{different}} features of the data on <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> firing properties, including the relationship of <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> to cellular properties and network oscillations. This paper describes a model that combines elements of two major classes of models of grid cells: models using interactions of oscillations and models using attractor dynamics. This model includes a population of units with oscillatory input representing input from the medial septum. These units are termed heading angle cells because their connectivity depends upon heading angle in the environment as well as the spatial phase coded by the cell. These cells project to a population of <b>grid</b> <b>cells.</b> The sum of the heading angle input results in standing waves of circularly symmetric input to the <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> population. Feedback from the <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> population increases the activity of subsets of the heading angle cells, resulting in the network settling into activity patterns that resemble the patterns of firing fields in a population of <b>grid</b> <b>cells.</b> The properties of heading angle cells firing as conjunctive grid-by-head-direction cells can shift the <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> firing according to movement velocity. The pattern of interaction of oscillations requires use of separate populations that fire on alternate cycles of the net theta rhythmic input to <b>grid</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|SummaryEstablishing how <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> are anatomically arranged, on a {{microscopic}} scale, {{in relation to}} their firing patterns in the environment would facilitate a greater microcircuit-level understanding of the brain’s representation of space. However, all previous <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> recordings used electrode techniques that provide limited descriptions of fine-scale organization. We therefore developed a technique for cellular-resolution functional imaging of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) neurons in mice navigating a virtual linear track, enabling a new experimental approach to study MEC. Using these methods, we show that <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> are physically clustered in MEC compared to nongrid cells. Additionally, we demonstrate that <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> are functionally micro-organized: the similarity between the environment firing locations of <b>grid</b> <b>cell</b> pairs varies {{as a function of the}} distance between them according to a “Mexican hat”-shaped profile.
