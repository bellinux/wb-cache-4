(age: 12. 6 ± 0. 7 years, height: 157. 9 ± 6. 9 cm, weight: 49. 7 ± 6. 7 kg) Two different protocols have been made in this research. In the first protocol, 5 minutes aerobic density and 5 x 10 m forward, backward, side general warming up exercice in submaximal level has been applied on each child and in the second protocol, after general warming up, static <b>streching</b> practice has been applied to the same children. After each warming up and <b>streching</b> practice, countermovement jump performance have been measured.

40|$|A {{study of}} the effect of both {{plasticizer}} and <b>streching</b> strain on the percolation transition in polyisoprene-carbon nanocomposites (PCNC) is reported. The orthopositronium (oPs) accessible free volume sites in the unstreched and streched PCNC without plasticizer as well as with plasticizer have been measured by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). The lifetime of oPs,  3, is related {{to the size of the}} free volume, and the intensity, I 3, to the number concentration of free volume sites. It was found that <b>streching</b> decreases the number of free volume cavities independent of the both mass parts carbon nano-particles (CNP) and plasticizer. The free volume cavity size has maximum value in the region of percolation transition. Percolation threshold was determined by electric resistance measurements (ERM). Both PALS and ERM show that the percolation threshold shifts to greater values of mass parts of CNP under <b>streching</b> strain. An opposite shift of percolation threshold was found under adding plasticizer. It is interesting that adding of CNP increases mean free volume cavity size at mass parts percolation threshold. It means that filling of cavities occurs above the percolation threshold.

In the first part, putative enantioenriched α-chloroalkyllithiums (CHRLiCl) were employed for double and triple <b>StReCH</b> of B-alkyl boronic esters to synthesize molecules containing multiple contiguous stereogenic centers.

This green colored ether extractable substance proved qualitative reaction for biliverdin and exhibited the absorption maximum at 700 and 375 mμ. in the glacial acetic acid. In the infrared absorption spectra of the ether extractable biliverdin, the following features were observed with that of L.
