60|$|Upon {{approaching}} nearer I {{perceived that}} a funeral procession {{had just left}} the church. An assistant priest and a barefooted Mexican altar-boy <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> in the arch of the ancient portal.|$|R
60|$|A moment {{scarcely}} had elapsed after Schneider leaped upon Jane Clayton and wrenched {{the revolver}} from her hand, {{when the door}} of the cabin opened and a tall and half-naked white man <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> within the portal.|$|R
60|$|The Englishman glanced back. For {{a moment}} the lean figure of Sosra the Egyptian <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> in the narrow doorway. The next the door had slammed, and the heavy rasping of a bolt broke on the silent night.|$|R
60|$|The port lock opened. Talking ceased abruptly, as {{everyone}} turned. A black-clad Martian official, a Province Leiter, <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> against the bleak sunlight, staring around the ship. Behind him {{a handful of}} Martian soldiers stood waiting, their guns ready.|$|R
60|$|Before {{she could}} speak the door burst open, and the boisterous Rosamund Hunt, in her {{flamboyant}} white hat, boa, and parasol, <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> in the doorway. She was in a breathing heat, and on her open face was {{an expression of the}} most infantile astonishment.|$|R
6000|$|The door of {{the room}} was flung open, and the fashionable negro <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> in it, his eyeballs rolling, his silk hat still insolently tilted on his head. [...] "Huh!" [...] he cried, showing his apish teeth. [...] "What this? Huh! Huh! You steal a {{coloured}} gentleman's prize--prize his already--yo' think yo' jes' save that white 'Talian trash--" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{signified}} assent, and Father Time went to {{the window}} for a moment and beckoned into the darkened street. Then I heard footsteps, clumsy and hesitant they seemed, upon the stairs. And in a moment a figure <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> in the doorway--the figure of Father Christmas. He stood shuffling his feet, a timid, apologetic look upon his face.|$|R
60|$|How {{long she}} lay there {{she did not}} know, but finally she was aroused by the opening of her cabin door. As she sprang to her feet ready to defend herself against what she felt might easily be some new form of danger her eyes went wide in astonishment as they rested {{on the face of}} the man who <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> in the doorway of her cabin.|$|R
60|$|She <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> in the doorway, tall, mystic, silent, with strange, wistful {{face and}} deep soul shining in her dark, {{questioning}} eyes. Nigel kissed {{the hand that}} she held out, and all his faith in woman and his reverence {{came back to him}} as he looked at her. Her sister had slipped behind her and her fair elfish face smiled her forgiveness of Nigel over Mary's shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly the {{curtains}} parted {{and a short}} man with a large head <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> in the opening. His face was impassive but his glance {{was one of the}} most piercing I had ever encountered. In the single instant before he smiled he discovered my character and my thought as though his eyes had been the lenses of some singular and powerful x-ray instrument. It was the glance of a novelist.|$|R
60|$|The hall {{door opened}} with a single sweep. Blinky <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> there, wild eyed. And the next instant Dick Hardman {{staggered}} from that closet. He had both hands pressed to his abdomen. Blood poured out in a stream. Pan heard strange watery sounds. Hardman reeled out into the hall, groaning. He slipped along the wall. Pan leaped, to see him slide down into a widening pool of blood.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Gethryn {{seemed about to}} speak. He looked fixedly at his uncle as he <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> in the doorway, a cheerful column of cool, calm, {{concentrated}} cheek. Then, as if realizing that no words that he knew could {{do justice to the}} situation, he raised his foot in silence, and 'booted' his own flesh and blood with marked emphasis. After which ceremony he went, still without a word, upstairs again.|$|R
6000|$|They were {{separated}} by {{two thirds of the}} length of the terrace, and he had to pass the drawing-room window. As he did so he started with an exclamation. Madame Clairin <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> in the opening as if, though just arriving on the scene, she too were already aware of its interest. Conscious, apparently, that she might be suspected of having watched them she stepped forward with a smile and looked from one to the other. [...] "Such a tete-a-tete as that one owes no apology for interrupting. One ought to come in for good manners." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} bell (1846) now {{is housed}} in {{the west side of}} the narthex, due to weakening of the steeple. Next to the church <b>stands</b> the <b>frame</b> gothic revival Parish Hall is circa (1875).|$|R

6000|$|Lady Sandgate, as he spoke, {{found her}} eyes meeting {{those of a}} young woman who, {{presenting}} herself from without, <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> in the doorway to the terrace; a slight fair grave young woman, of middle, stature and simply dressed, whose brow showed clear even under the heavy shade of a large hat surmounted with big black bows and feathers. Her eyes had vaguely questioned those of her elder, who at once replied to the gentleman forming the subject of their inquiry: [...] "Lady Grace must know." [...] At this the young woman came forward, and Lady Sandgate introduced the visitor. [...] "My dear Grace, this is Mr. Breckenridge Bender." ...|$|R
60|$|They had now burst {{across a}} veil of underwood, and were come into a lawn among the forest, very green and innocent, and solemnly {{surrounded}} by trees. Otto paused on the margin, looking about him with delight; then his glance returned to Seraphina, as she <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> in that silvan pleasantness and looking at her husband with undecipherable eyes. A weakness both {{of the body and}} mind fell on him like the beginnings of sleep; the cords of his activity were relaxed, his eyes clung to her. ‘Let us rest,’ he said; and he made her sit down, and himself sat down beside her on the slope of an inconsiderable mound.|$|R
50|$|Asset Control Logistics: {{companies}} in the retail channels, both organized retailers and suppliers, often deploy assets required for the display, preservation, promotion of their products. Some examples are refrigerators, stands, display monitors, seasonal equipment, poster <b>stands</b> & <b>frames.</b>|$|R

60|$|She <b>stood</b> there, <b>framed</b> by the lintel, in the daintiest of aprons, the daintiest of caps {{upon her}} golden hair; and every {{objection}} she swept aside {{with the wind}} of her merry wilfulness. No one ever had their way with her, nor wanted it.|$|R

60|$|A silence fell {{suddenly}} {{between us}} which I somehow {{expected to be}} unbroken. But it had not fallen {{for more than a}} few seconds when, in the utter stillness, I distinctly heard a very rapid step coming nearer and nearer along the street. The next moment a figure flung itself into the shop and <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> in the doorway. He wore a large white hat tilted back as if in impatience; he had tight black old-fashioned pantaloons, a gaudy old-fashioned stock and waistcoat, and an old fantastic coat. He had large, wide-open, luminous eyes like those of an arresting actor; he had a pale, nervous face, and a fringe of beard. He took in the shop and the old man in a look that seemed literally a flash and uttered the exclamation of a man utterly staggered.|$|R
60|$|Five minutes passed. The bride stood silently at {{the foot}} of the throne. The guests spoke {{together}} in low whispers until the room was filled with the hum of many voices. At length the doors leading into The Hall of Chiefs swung open, and the resplendent bridegroom <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> for a moment in the massive opening. A hush fell upon the wedding guests. With measured and impressive step the groom approached the bride. Tara felt the muscles of her heart contract with the apprehension that had been growing upon her as the coils of Fate settled more closely about her and no sign came from Turan. Where was he? What, indeed, could he accomplish now to save her? Surrounded by the power of O-Tar with never a friend among them, her position seemed at last without vestige of hope.|$|R
60|$|A {{moment later}} our modest apartment, already so {{distinguished}} that morning, was further honoured by {{the entrance of}} the most lovely woman in London. I had often heard of the beauty of the youngest daughter of the Duke of Belminster, but no description of it, and no contemplation of colourless photographs, had prepared me for the subtle, delicate charm and the beautiful colouring of that exquisite head. And yet as we saw it that autumn morning, it was not its beauty which would be the first thing to impress the observer. The cheek was lovely but it was paled with emotion, the eyes were bright but it was the brightness of fever, the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn in an effort after self-command. Terror--not beauty--was what sprang first to the eye as our fair visitor <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> for an instant in the open door.|$|R
6000|$|Several gentlemen in {{evening dress}} <b>stood</b> <b>framed</b> in the lighted doorway, shouting: [...] "Have your tickets {{in your hands}} and give them up as you pass in." [...] They were fine fellows, helping in a splendid work, and their society did much good, {{though it was not}} so well {{organized}} as others that have followed in its steps; but Shovel, you may believe, was in no mood to attend to them. He had but one thought: that the traitor Tommy was doubtless at that moment boring his way toward them, underground, as it were, and [...] "holding his ticket in his hand." [...] Shovel dived into the rabble and was flung back upside down. Falling with his arms round a full-grown man, he immediately ran up him {{as if he had been}} a lamp-post, and was aloft just sufficiently long to see Tommy give up the ticket and saunter into the hall.|$|R

40|$|Site {{where the}} Hotel de la Havana once <b>stood.</b> The <b>frame</b> {{structure}} {{was built in}} 1887 and destroyed by fire in 1891. It was located in the Latin Quarter in Tampa, Florida. A building with various retail establishments now occupies the site. This is a contributing building on the National Register of Historic Places and a National Historic Landmark (NRIS and NHLS # 74000641). It is {{also a part of}} the Ybor City Historic District.

50|$|The show is filmed on {{location}} at several different locales around Vancouver, British Columbia. Episodes are also occasionally recorded in other cities, such as Tokyo, Japan. A common trademark {{of the show}} is to have the hosts <b>stand</b> in <b>frame</b> as video game footage is projected onto an object in the background such as a billboard or the side of a building. The show is filmed {{over the course of several}} hours and later edited to fit the show's thirty-minute time frame.|$|R
60|$|A {{strange thing}} {{happened}} to me, too, that night. When for {{the second or third}} time the crowd was flocking in to view me, my eyes chanced to fall on a figure standing in the clouded light a little apart. He was dressed in a high-peaked hat and a long and seemingly brown cassock-like garment, with buttoned tunic and silver-buckled leather belt. Spurs were on his boots, a light whip in his hand. Aloof, his head a little bowed down, his face in profile, he <b>stood</b> there, <b>framed</b> in the opening, dusky, level-featured, deep-eyed--a Stranger.|$|R
40|$|This Master’s thesis {{deals with}} {{measuring}} of acting forces from rider to footbike during the ride, {{followed by the}} construction of test stand to draw an equivalent load. Measurements and subsequent analysis of acting forces from the rider to the footbike were made. These results were then used for complete design of the test <b>stand.</b> The <b>frame</b> of the test stand was subdued to a stress analysis. A complete automatic control system, including a pneumatic control circuit, was also designed. The proposed automatic test stand was then manufactured and put into operation...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] she replied, {{but without}} looking up. Eliphalet led the way. He {{came to the}} summer house, glanced around it with {{apparent}} satisfaction, and put {{his foot on the}} moss-grown step. Virginia did a surprising thing. She leaped quickly into the doorway before him, and <b>stood</b> facing him, <b>framed</b> in the climbing roses.|$|R
60|$|Whilst a {{man might}} tell a dozen did those two remain motionless, the one eyeing the other. But their bearing was as widely {{different}} as their figures; Eugène's stalwart <b>frame</b> <b>stood</b> firm and erect, insolence in every line of it, reflected perchance from the smile that lurked about {{the corners of his}} thin­lipped mouth.|$|R
