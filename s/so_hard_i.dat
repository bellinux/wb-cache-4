25|$|Shooting 'Put It in a Love Song' in Rio, in Brazil, {{was very}} incredible, I {{feel that the}} energy of the city matches {{the energy of the}} song. It's sensual, it's exciting, it's so rich with color. I loved it. The people came out so heavy and <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> <b>I</b> think it was exciting, {{especially}} to participate and experience it with them like that. Me and B have a good relationship. And {{to be able to have}} the chemistry we have and do it in a city that's so unique like that is unforgettable. The pictures speak a thousand words. So you saw the energy out there. It was great.|$|E

500|$|Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} [...] "SeinfeldVision was a clever and ironic way to {{incorporate}} Seinfeld." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide said that [...] " [...] {{was a solid}} start to the new, fought-for season" [...] and that it did have [...] "some great, great moments." [...] Despite this praise, Webb Mitovich criticised Kenneth and Tracy's [...] "office wife" [...] storyline saying that [...] "we've seen this shtick before on countless other sitcoms, {{so it was a}} bit empty and filled with 'easy' jokes." [...] Criticism was also received regarding the [...] "striped outfit... it didn't work. No," [...] referring to a joke involving Jenna trying to distract the TGS writers from her newly gained weight. Lisa Schmeiser of Television Without Pity graded this episode as a [...] "B+." [...] Rick Porter of Zap2it thought that this episode [...] "started off [...] second season on a pretty strong note." [...] Porter said that this episode wasn't the best episode of 30 Rock but it was still [...] "one of the sharpest and wittiest comedies on television." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that [...] "SeinfeldVision" [...] "was a really funny beginning to the second season." [...] Sassone also notes that the appearance of Seinfeld did not feel like stunt casting. He also said that the joke about Jerry being able to buy NBC for $4 million was [...] "one of the many reasons [...] this show." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that this episode [...] "proves the low-rated show's best comedy Emmy win was no undeserved fluke." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger described this episode as [...] "really funny" [...] and thought that [...] "everyone is played in a style that's believable within [...]" [...] Linda Stasi of The New York Post said that [...] "the on-going story of the regulars that had me laughing <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>I</b> almost fell out of bed." [...] Jake Brooks of The New York Observer thought that this episode was [...] "a rather poor 22 minutes of television (well, only [...] portion of it, the rest was pretty great)." [...] Robert Canning of IGN said that [...] "30 Rock delivers a fantastic episode to open the season. Let's hope they can also deliver an audience to keep this great show on the air." [...] Canning also awarded this episode a rating of 9.4 out of 10. Brian Lowry of Variety said that it [...] "neatly highlights this series' strengths and weaknesses, elevated by moments of inspiration and Alec Baldwin's brilliance and leavened by considerably-less-flattering silliness." [...] Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times thought that [...] "SeinfeldVision" [...] "is mostly a reminder that even the most talented actors and writers sometimes slip under pressure." [...] Seinfeld was criticized as using his appearance in this episode as a plug for his upcoming feature film Bee Movie. Seinfeld, NBC and General Electric stated that this was done as metahumor.|$|E
2500|$|The singer would record {{late into}} the morning, {{sometimes}} until noon, before riding her bus to the next city. In May 2012, Rihanna revealed that whilst she was recording the album, she suffered from exhaustion, saying in part: [...] "It was the best [...] ever, it was some rock star [...] This is the craziest schedule I've ever been on in my entire life. One morning I woke up and started crying <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> <b>I</b> finally just got to my bed from the IV [...] and I was just like, 'Good I can actually get to sleep tonight', because we stayed up all night' and I finished [...] at 5pm the day before..." ...|$|E
2500|$|He said Norton's {{experience}} as a theatre actor combined with his self-confidence meant that [...] "in a way {{there was some kind}} of mental reality to Edward", but Norton believes he was the one who convinced Iñárritu to take him on. Norton was a fan of the director's work and impressed with his ability to push outside film-making boundaries. Norton heard about Iñárritu's project from a friend. Once he got the script, he read it straight through until 3:00 am. Norton said, [...] "I laughed <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>I</b> woke people up." [...] Norton wanted to meet Iñárritu the next day, and once they met, Norton told him he could not cast someone who was the [...] "embodiment" [...] of what the script was taking aim at. Instead, the director needed to cast someone [...] "who has at least a little bit of authentic depth of experience, in this world." [...] Iñárritu agreed.|$|E

2500|$|A. J. Allmendinger {{held off}} a hard {{charging}} Marcos Ambrose with two laps remaining to score his first career Sprint Cup Series victory. [...] "My gosh, I can't believe we've won a NASCAR Sprint Cup race," [...] Allmendinger said. [...] "With this whole 47 team, [...] Tad Geschickter, Jody Geschickter, Brad Daugherty, {{all the great}} sponsors we have, our first Cup victory together, my first victory...I love these guys. I just wanted it so bad for them and this team. They work <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> <b>I</b> wasn't gonna let Marcos take that from me." [...] "First of all, congratulations to AJ and the 47 team," [...] Ambrose said. [...] "They deserved that win. I left nothing on the table. I tried to rattle his cage and couldn't shake him. We raced fair and square to the end there. It was a tough couple laps but it was fair. We were both giving it to each other pretty hard. No harm, no foul. We just came up a little short." ...|$|E
2500|$|New York struck first. [...] Josh Devore {{walked with}} one out in the third, and {{advanced}} to third base on a single by Larry Doyle lost in the sun by Duffy Lewis. [...] After Fred Snodgrass struck out, Red Murray's single scored Devore and Doyle for a 2–0 Giants lead. [...] Tesreau and his spitball held the Red Sox hitless {{for the first five}} innings, but Boston then cut the lead to 2–1 in the sixth on a triple by Tris Speaker that fell to the ground untouched when neither Snodgrass nor Devore called for the ball (in an Alphonse-Gaston act), and an RBI groundout by Lewis. [...] The Red Sox scored three runs in the very next inning, on an RBI double by Harry Hooper and a two-run single by Steve Yerkes, after Giants second baseman Doyle had muffed Wood's potential inning-ending double play grounder and had to settle for the one out at second. [...] In the bottom of the ninth, the Giants scored a run and had the tying run on third and the winning run on second, but Wood, a spectacular 34–5 in the regular season, struck out the last two batters for the 4–3 Boston win in a complete game with eleven strikeouts. [...] Oddly, McGraw let relief pitcher Doc Crandall bat for himself for {{what turned out to be}} the last out rather than using backup catcher Art Wilson to pinch-hit. After the game Wood said, [...] "I threw <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>I</b> thought my arm would fly right off my body." ...|$|E
