5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} {{deterioration of the}} heart muscle's ability to contract, {{which can lead to}} heart failure. The causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, <b>systemic</b> <b>disease</b> such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy can cause the heart to become enlarged (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), constrict the outflow tracts of the heart (restrictive cardiomyopathy), or cause the heart to dilate and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a small-vessel {{vasculitis}} {{in which}} complexes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and complement component 3 (C3) are deposited on arterioles, capillaries, and venules. As with IgA nephropathy, serum levels of IgA {{are high in}} HSP and there are identical findings on renal biopsy; however, IgA nephropathy has a predilection for young adults while HSP is more predominant among children. Further, IgA nephropathy typically only affects the kidneys while HSP is a <b>systemic</b> <b>disease.</b> HSP involves the skin and connective tissues, scrotum, joints, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Other diagnoses {{that are}} {{typically}} considered include fractures, tumors, or <b>systemic</b> <b>disease</b> if plantar fasciitis pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel {{pain in the}} context of a systemic illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or serological markers of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained. Neurological deficits may prompt an investigation with electromyography to evaluate for damage to the nerves or muscles.|$|E
5000|$|Periodontitis as {{a manifestation}} of <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases</b> is one of the seven {{categories}} of periodontitis as defined by the American Academy of Periodontology 1999 classification system. [...] At least 16 <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases</b> have been linked to periodontitis. These <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases</b> are associated with periodontal disease because they generally contribute to either a decreased host resistance to infections or dysfunction in the connective tissue of the gums, increasing patient susceptibility to inflammation-induced destruction.|$|R
40|$|A healthy {{periodontium}} {{is needed}} for the general well being of an individual. However, periodontal diseases are common and periodontal infections are increasingly associated with <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases.</b> The literature {{is focused on the}} association between periodontal infections and <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases.</b> The individuals with periodontal disease may be at higher risk for adverse medical outcomes including cardiovascular diseases, respiratory infections, adverse pregnancy outcomes, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus. Many cohorts, in vitro and animal studies suggest that systemic inflammation due to pathogens associated with periodontal disease {{may play a role in}} the initiation and progression of some <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Periodontal infections should therefore be considered as a risk factor for various <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the effects of medications and <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases</b> on major salivary gland flow rates. Unstimulated and 2 % citrate-stimulated parotid and submandibular salivas were collected from 293 subjects of the oral physiology component of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The influence of the number of medications and diseases on salivary flow rates was determined by separate one-way ANOVA tests. There was an overall decrease in both parotid and submandibular flow rates with increasing numbers of medications and <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases.</b> However, this was significant (p < 0. 05) only for unstimulated submandibular flow rates (with increasing numbers of <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases)</b> and stimulated submandibular flow rates (with increasing numbers of <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases</b> and medications). Unstimulated flow rates rapidly approached zero with increasing numbers of medications and diseases. These results suggest that the submandibular gland may be more sensitive to physiologic permutations than the parotid gland. In addition, individuals being treated for multiple <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases</b> and taking numerous medications may be more susceptible to salivary hypofunction...|$|R

25|$|Since the 1990s, {{reviews of}} the studies that sought causal links between silicone-gel breast {{implants}} and <b>systemic</b> <b>disease</b> reported no link between the implants and subsequent systemic and autoimmune diseases.

40|$|Etiology of {{abnormalities}} in tooth {{structure has}} been subject of numerous studies but {{still has not}} been fully understood. Heredity is an established etiological factor for many types of structural anomalies of the teeth. Factors that cause changes in enamel structure may be genetic, immunologic and teratogenic or <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Genetic changes may include individual genes, micro deletions or chromosomal defects. <b>Systemic</b> <b>diseases</b> {{can be associated with}} anomalies of tooth structure and diversity of clinical picture requires a multidisciplinary approach to the therapy. Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) represents a large group of structural abnormalities of the teeth. AI can exist independently or as a part of large number of syndromes and <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Knowledge of clinical presentation, etiology, pathogenesis of structural anomalies of the teeth and their association with certain <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases</b> is of great importance to everyday dental practice in terms of prevention, prognosis and therapy. Also, it is necessary to expand basic knowledge of pediatricians in regards to the clinical picture of anomalies in tooth structure and their possible association {{with a wide range of}} <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases</b> and syndromes, in order to provide comprehensive clinical treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to present etiopathogenesis and classification and to describe the most important abnormalities of enamel structure and their association with <b>systemic</b> <b>diseases</b> and syndromes...|$|R

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} comes {{mostly from}} the history and examination, but the following special investigations may be involved: blood tests (vitamin deficiency, anemia, leukemia, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV infection, diabetes) microbiological swabs (infection), or urinalysis (diabetes). A biopsy (minor procedure to cut out {{a small sample of}} the ulcer to look at under a microscope) with or without immunofluorescence may be required, to rule out cancer, but also if a <b>systemic</b> <b>disease</b> is suspected. Ulcers caused by local trauma are painful to touch and sore. They usually have an irregular border with erythematous margins and the base is yellow. As healing progresses, a keratotic (thickened, white mucosa) halo may occur.|$|E
25|$|Periodontal {{disease is}} the most common disease found in dogs and affects more than 80% of dogs aged three years or older. Its {{prevalence}} in dogs increases with age, but decreases with increasing body weight; i.e., toy and miniature breeds are more severely affected. Recent research undertaken at the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition has established that the bacteria associated with gum disease in dogs {{are not the same as}} in humans. <b>Systemic</b> <b>disease</b> may develop because the gums are very vascular (have a good blood supply). The blood stream carries these anaerobic micro-organisms, and they are filtered out by the kidneys and liver, where they may colonize and create microabscesses. The microorganisms traveling through the blood may also attach to the heart valves, causing vegetative infective endocarditis (infected heart valves). Additional diseases that may result from periodontitis include chronic bronchitis and pulmonary fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} an anti-tumoral {{response}} {{of the immune system}} in vivo was recognized by the physician William B. Coley. In 1968, Dr. Gale A Granger from the University of California, Irvine, reported a cytotoxic factor produced by lymphocytes and named it lymphotoxin (LT). Credit for this discovery is shared by Dr. Nancy H. Ruddle from Yale University, who reported the same activity in a series of back-to-back articles published in the same month. Subsequently, in 1975 Dr. Lloyd J. Old from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, reported another cytotoxic factor produced by macrophages and named it tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Both factors were described based on their ability to kill mouse fibrosarcoma L-929 cells. These concepts were extended to <b>systemic</b> <b>disease</b> in 1981, when Ian A. Clark, from the Australian National University, in collaboration with Elizabeth Carswell in Dr. Old's group, working with pre-sequencing era data, reasoned that excessive production of TNF causes malaria disease and endotoxin poisoning.|$|E
