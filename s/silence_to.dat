5|$|In this ending, Loco {{draws his}} gun without {{waiting to be}} {{prompted}} by Silence. Suddenly, Burnett, having survived falling into the frozen lake, rides into town on horseback and shoots Loco in the head, allowing <b>Silence</b> <b>to</b> kill the remaining bounty killers. Burnett frees the outlaws as Pauline takes the bandages on Silence's burnt right hand off, revealing a gauntlet that he used for protection, before applying bandages to his wounded left hand. As Burnett takes the thieves to the local jail to await their amnesty, he asks <b>Silence</b> <b>to</b> become his deputy, which he accepts with a smile.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quatrain, the poet elaborates upon his sentiments {{made in the}} first quatrain, {{comparing}} the present <b>silence</b> <b>to</b> the relationship when it was new. He uses seasonal imagery to set up his atmosphere, which he continues to use in line three, where we also encounter an allusion to the myth of Philomela, {{which can be a}} poetic name for the nightingale.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, Southern Rhodesians' {{service on}} Britain's behalf in the World Wars, {{particularly}} the Second, {{was an integral}} part of the colony's national psyche. The territory had also latterly contributed to British counter-insurgency operations in Malaya, Aden and Cyprus, as well as Operation Vantage in Kuwait. The colonial government's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 was deliberately made on 11 November, Armistice Day, in an attempt to emphasise the territory's prior war record on Britain's behalf. The proclamation was signed at 11:00 local time, during the customary two-minute <b>silence</b> <b>to</b> remember the fallen.|$|E

5|$|Lennon's murder {{triggered}} {{an outpouring}} of grief {{around the world on}} an unprecedented scale. Lennon's remains were cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, Westchester County, N.Y.; no funeral was held. Ono sent word to the chanting crowd outside the Dakota that their singing had kept her awake; she asked that they re-convene at Central Park's Naumburg Bandshell the following Sunday for ten minutes of silent prayer. On 14 December 1980, {{millions of people around the}} world responded to Ono's request to pause for ten minutes of <b>silence</b> <b>to</b> remember Lennon. Thirty thousand gathered in Liverpool, and the largest group—over 225,000—converged on New York's Central Park, close to the scene of the shooting. For those ten minutes, every radio station in New York City went off the air.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April 2013, the Chamber of Deputies of Mexico {{observed}} {{a moment of}} <b>silence</b> <b>to</b> remember Regina Martínez, after a proposal made by Manuel Rafael Huerta from the Labor Party (PT). Huerta mentioned in his petition that {{a year after the}} murder the circumstances were still unclear and the official version from the government of Veracruz was not to be believed. The president of the chamber left those comments out, but found the proposal relevant and invited deputies to join in the minute of silence.|$|E
5|$|Wittmann's Tiger {{was spotted}} at about 09:00 by Sergeant O'Connor of the Rifle Brigade, who was {{travelling}} towards Point 213 in a half-track and broke radio <b>silence</b> <b>to</b> give the only warning the British force received. The Tiger emerged from cover onto Route Nationale 175 and knocked out a Cromwell, the rearmost tank at Point 213. A Sherman Firefly was then knocked out, caught fire and blocked the road. The British at Point 213 were then engaged {{by the rest}} of the 2nd Company and lost three more tanks.|$|E

40|$|The Fifth Amendment's {{due process}} clause {{requires}} the prosecution to share evidence with the defense, and its right <b>to</b> <b>silence</b> blocks the jury from drawing an adverse inference from the defendant's silence during trial. I examine {{the effect of}} the right <b>to</b> <b>silence</b> and the disclosure requirement on conviction rates and social welfare in an economic model of criminal trials. Many policy-relevant results emerge. The right <b>to</b> <b>silence</b> can only improve welfare if juries discriminate unduly against defendants. With the right <b>to</b> <b>silence,</b> mandatory disclosure always increases welfare. Mandatory disclosure always reduces the welfare-efficiency of the right <b>to</b> <b>silence.</b> The right <b>to</b> <b>silence</b> combined with mandatory disclosure is more likely to increase welfare than is the right <b>to</b> <b>silence</b> alone. The most efficient mechanism is either mandatory disclosure alone or mandatory disclosure combined with the right <b>to</b> <b>silence.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Kurt Busch {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner, followed by outside polesitter Jeff Gordon. On the following lap, Smith began to assist Busch by drafting. On lap 3, NASCAR held a moment of <b>silence</b> <b>to</b> honor Dale Earnhardt, who was killed ten years earlier in the 2001 race. On lap4, A. J. Allmendinger and Mark Martin moved to {{the first and second}} positions. A lap later, the first caution was flown when Kyle Busch got turned sideways. Under caution, he made a pit stop to have his car's toe plate checked and to have the front end aligned. When the race restarted on lap8, Kevin Harvick led but after one lap, Martin and Allmendinger passed him. Three laps later, the second caution came out when J. J. Yeley had an engine failure. Most of the drivers made pit stops under the caution, except for Brad Keselowski. At the restart, he would lead and Bobby Labonte passed him for the lead on the next lap.|$|E
5|$|The news of {{the fall}} of Kilinochchi to the Sri Lankan Military {{resulted}} in celebration, including gathering on the streets and lighting firecrackers, in places like Nuwara Eliya, Anuradhapura, Colombo, Ampara and Kalutara. The Government of Sri Lanka claimed that the population in Jaffna celebrated the capture by raising the national flag with anti-LTTE slogans and demonstrations. However Tamilnet, the pro-rebel website, denied these claims and claimed that the public were forced {{to take part in the}} celebrations. It claimed that the Sri Lankan Army confiscated the National identity cards of many residents in order to force them to take part. The country officially marked the capture of Kilinochchi on 5 January by hoisting the national flag and observing two minutes of <b>silence</b> <b>to</b> honour the troops, while television and radio stations either blacked out their regular bulletins during this time or played patriotic songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{operational}} {{plan called for}} strict radio <b>silence</b> <b>to</b> ensure surprise could be maintained. This required Meendsen-Bohlken to have total tactical and operational control of his ship; shore-based commands {{would be unable to}} direct the mission. On 16 August, Admiral Scheer and her destroyer escort left Narvik on a course to pass to the north of Novaya Zemlya. Upon entering the Kara Sea, she encountered heavy ice; in addition to searching for merchant shipping, the Arado floatplane was used to scout paths through the ice fields. On 25 August, she encountered the Soviet icebreaker Sibiryakov. Admiral Scheer sank the icebreaker, but not before she sent a distress signal. The German ship then turned south, and two days later, arrived off the port of Dikson. Admiral Scheer damaged two ships in the port and shelled harbor facilities. Meendsen-Bohlken considered sending a landing party ashore, but firing from Soviet shore batteries convinced him to abandon the plan. After breaking off the bombardment, Meendsen-Bohlken decided to return to Narvik. She reached port on 30 August without having achieved any significant successes.|$|E

5|$|While the Grand Prince is away in Lithuania, his power-hungry {{younger brother}} forms an {{allegiance}} {{with a group}} of Tatars and raids Vladimir. We see flashbacks of the Grand Prince and his brother attending a religious service in the church, and see the rivalry and animosity between them. The invasion of the combined armed forces on horseback and the resulting carnage is shown in great detail. The city is burned, the citizens are murdered and women raped and killed. One scene shows a horse falling from a flight of stairs and being stabbed by a spear. Another shows a cow being set on fire. Foma narrowly escapes being killed in the city and escapes into the nearby countryside, but as he is crossing a river he is shot in the back with an arrow and killed. The Tatars force their way into the barricaded church, now fully decorated with Andrei's paintings, where the majority of the citizens have taken refuge. The Tatars show no mercy and massacre the people inside and burn all the painted wooden altarpieces. Andrei saves Durochka from being raped by killing a Tatar with an axe. The Bishop's messenger is cruelly tortured to make him reveal the location of the city's gold, which he refuses to do. After being repeatedly burned, he has liquid metal from a melted crucifix poured into his mouth and is dragged away tied to a horse. In the aftermath only Andrei and Durochka are left alive in the church. Andrei imagines a conversation with the dead Theophanes the Greek, lamenting the loss of his work and the evil of mankind, while Durochka distractedly plaits the hair of a dead woman. Andrei decides to give up painting and takes a vow of <b>silence</b> <b>to</b> atone for killing another man.|$|E

50|$|Ted announces to a horrified Dougal that Father Paul Stone (Michael Redmond) {{has come}} for his holidays. For the {{preceding}} six years, Father Stone has visited the parochial house; he is pathologically boring and is totally unable to hold a conversation, giving one-sentence answers at the most and dominating the room with his awkward protracted <b>silences.</b> <b>To</b> try {{to stop him from}} coming, Ted told Father Stone incredible lies, but this failed to deter him.|$|R
