The best performance was obtained when the <b>sensitizers</b> were mixed {{at a ratio of}} 60 %: 40 % (M:R). The HOMO and LUMO levels of all of the investigated <b>sensitizers</b> were calculated. The optical band gap value decreased when the <b>sensitizers</b> were mixed. The individual rengas and mengkulang <b>sensitizers</b> exhibited lower energy conversion efficiencies (ŋ) than their mixed forms. The low IPCE percentage was found to contribute to the low energy conversion efficiencies (ŋ) of the DSSCs, with the individual <b>sensitizers</b> achieving a lower IPCE than their mixed forms. The efficiencies obtained using these <b>sensitizers</b> remain low for large-scale practical applications, but the results may serve as a reference for future studies on these new natural <b>sensitizers.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{interest}} {{in this study is}} towards effective natural <b>sensitizers.</b> In the last two decades, {{a number of studies have}} tested variable plant parts, such as flowers, leaves, barks, and roots, in search of effective natural <b>sensitizers.</b> However, most of the studies in the open literature did not investigate potential <b>sensitizers</b> extracted from the wood of forest trees. Malaysia is known for the biodiversity of its tropical rainforests that are home to various tree species. Hence, exploring the contribution of trees to fields other than the furniture industry, such as the field of solar energy, is important. The present study introduces <b>sensitizers</b> extracted from rengas (Gluta spp.) and mengkulang (Heritieraelata) wood and examines their optical properties and performance in DSSCs. In addition, the ratios of the mixtures of these <b>sensitizers</b> are manipulated to investigate their effectiveness on device performance.|$|R

40|$|The use {{of animal}} models in {{chemical}} safety testing will be significantly limited {{due to the}} recent introduction of the 3 Rs principle of animal experimentation in research. Although several in vitro assays to predict the sensitizing potential of chemicals have been developed, these methods cannot distinguish chemical respiratory <b>sensitizers</b> and skin <b>sensitizers.</b> In the present study, we describe a novel in vitro assay that can discriminate respiratory <b>sensitizers</b> from chemical skin <b>sensitizers</b> {{by taking advantage of}} the fundamental difference between their modes of action, namely the development of the T helper 2 immune response, which is critically important for respiratory sensitization. First, we established a novel three-dimensional (3 D) coculture system of human upper airway epithelium using a commercially available scaffold. It consists of human airway epithelial cell line BEAS- 2 B, immature dendritic cells (DCs) derived from human peripheral blood CD 14 + monocytes, and human lung fibroblast cell line MRC- 5. Respective cells were first cultured in individual scaffolds and subsequently assembled into a 3 D multi-cell tissue model to more closely mimic the in vivo situation. Then, three typical chemicals that are known respiratory <b>sensitizers</b> (ortho-phthaldialdehyde, hexamethylene diisocyanate, and trimellitic anhydride) and skin <b>sensitizers</b> (oxazolone, formaldehyde, and dinitrochlorobenzene) were added individually to the 3 D coculture system. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that DCs do not migrate into other scaffolds under the experimental conditions. Therefore, the 3 D structure was disassembled and real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was performed in individual scaffolds to analyze the expression levels of molecules critical for Th 2 differentiation such as OX 40 ligand (OX 40 L), interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 10, IL- 33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin. Both <b>sensitizers</b> showed similarly augmented expression of DC maturation markers (e. g., CD 86), but among these molecules, OX 40 L expression in DCs was most consistently and significantly enhanced by respiratory <b>sensitizers</b> as compared to that by skin <b>sensitizers.</b> Thus, we have established a 3 D coculture system mimicking the airway upper epithelium that may be successfully applied to discriminate chemical respiratory <b>sensitizers</b> from skin <b>sensitizers</b> by measuring the critical molecule for Th 2 differentiation, OX 40 L, in DCs...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{sensitization}} is {{an adverse}} immunologic response to chemical substances, inducing hypersensitivity in exposed individuals. Identifying chemical <b>sensitizers</b> {{is of great}} importance for chemical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry, {{in order to prevent}} the use of <b>sensitizers</b> in consumer products. Historically, chemical <b>sensitizers</b> have been assessed mainly by in vivo methods, however, recently enforced European legislations urge and promote the development of animal-free test methods able to predict chemical <b>sensitizers.</b> Recently, we presented a predictive biomarker signature in the myeloid cell line MUTZ- 3, for assessment of skin <b>sensitizers.</b> The identified genomic biomarkers were found to be involved in immunologically relevant pathways, induced by recognition of foreign substances and regulating dendritic cell maturation and cytoprotective mechanisms. We have developed the usage of this biomarker signature into a novel in vitro assay for assessment of chemical <b>sensitizers,</b> called Genomic Allergen Rapid Detection, GARD. The assay is based on chemical stimulation of MUTZ- 3 cultures, using the compounds to be assayed as stimulatory agents. The readout of the assay is a transcriptional quantification of the genomic predictors, collectively termed the GARD Prediction Signature, using a complete genome expression array. Compounds are predicted as either <b>sensitizers</b> or non-sensitizers by a Support Vector Machine model. In this report, we provide a proof of concept for the functionality of the GARD assay by describing the classification of 26 blinded and 11 non-blinded chemicals as <b>sensitizers</b> or non-sensitizers.

There is currently an unmet demand for safe and effective insulin <b>sensitizers,</b> owing to the restricted prescription or removal from market of certain approved insulin <b>sensitizers,</b> such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs), because of safety concerns. Effective insulin <b>sensitizers</b> without TZD-like side effects will therefore be invaluable to diabetic patients.

Direct PPARγ agonists, selective PPARγ modulators (sPPARγMs), PPARγ-sparing compounds (including ligands of the mitochondrial target of TZDs), agents that target the downstream effectors of PPARγ, along with agents, such as heat shock protein (HSP) inducers, 5 ′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators, 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 β-HSD 1) selective inhibitors, biguanides, and chloroquines, which may be safer than traditional TZDs, have been described.

40|$|Although p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) play {{a crucial}} role in the {{activation}} of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) by contact <b>sensitizers,</b> the upstream signals of p 38 MAPK remain undetermined. To examine whether <b>sensitizers</b> induce redox or oxidative stress in dendritic cells (DC), which subsequently stimulate p 38 MAPK, we measured the ratio of the oxidized (GSSG) versus reduced (GSH) form of cellular glutathione in MoDC stimulated with five <b>sensitizers</b> including NiCl 2 and 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and three non-sensitizers including sodium dodecyl sulfate using colorimetric assays. All the <b>sensitizers,</b> but none of the non-sensitizers at sublethal concentration, reduced the GSH/GSSG ratio, which was accompanied by phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK. Treatment with the antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, which suppressed the reduction of the GSH/GSSG ratio, abrogated both the phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK and the augmentation of CD 86 expression. A similar response pattern was observed in THP- 1 macrophage-monocyte cells. Unexpectedly, however, formaldehyde (HCHO) reduced the GSH/GSSG ratio in MoDC, but not in THP- 1. This finding, in conjunction with the observation that DNCB and NiCl 2 reduced the GSH/GSSG ratio at different kinetics, indicated that the <b>sensitizers</b> reduced the GSH/GSSG ratio by a different mechanism. These data suggest that the GSH/GSSG imbalance plays a crucial role in triggering DC maturation by <b>sensitizers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Currently, hazard {{characterization}} of skin <b>sensitizers</b> {{is based on}} data obtained from studies examining single chemicals. Many consumer products, however, contain mixtures of <b>sensitizers</b> that might interact {{in such a way}} that the response induced by a substance is higher than predicted in the hazard assessment. To assess interaction of skin <b>sensitizers</b> in a mixture, a dose-response modeling approach is applied. With this approach, it is possible to assess whether or not responses from mixtures of <b>sensitizers</b> can be predicted from the dose-response information obtained from individual chemicals using dose addition. We selected the skin <b>sensitizers</b> isoeugenol and cinnamal, frequently occurring together in consumer products, to be examined in an adjusted local lymph node assay (LLNA). Cell number and cytokine production (IL- 10 and IFN-c) of the auricular lymph nodes were measured as hallmarks of the skin sensitization response. We found that dose addition for these 2 skin <b>sensitizers</b> closely predicted the effects from mixtures of both chemicals across the broad dose range tested. Hence, isoeugenol and cinnamal show no synergistic effects in the LLNA. Therefore, hazard assessment and risk assessment of these substances can be performed without taking into account mixture exposure.

40|$|Repeated {{exposure}} to certain {{low molecular weight}} (LMW) chemical compounds may result in development of allergic reactions in the skin or in the respiratory tract. In most cases, a certain LMW compound selectively sensitize the skin, giving rise to allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), or the respiratory tract, giving rise to occupational asthma (OA). To limit occurrence of allergic diseases, efforts are currently being made to develop predictive assays that accurately identify chemicals capable of inducing such reactions. However, while a few promising methods for prediction of skin sensitization have been described, to date no validated method, in vitro or in vivo, exists that is able to accurately classify chemicals as respiratory <b>sensitizers.</b> Recently, we presented the in vitro based Genomic Allergen Rapid Detection (GARD) assay as a novel testing strategy for classification of skin sensitizing chemicals based on measurement of a genomic biomarker signature.

30|$|The {{performance}} of DSSCs depends on <b>sensitizers</b> {{that act as}} light harvesters in the mechanism. The best <b>sensitizers</b> must be capable of absorbing {{a wide range of}} visible light and producing electrons [12]. Natural dyes provide different types of pigments and thus serve as alternative <b>sensitizers</b> for inexpensive organic-based DSSCs. The requirements that natural dyes should meet are as follows:(1) ability to absorb a wide range of visible and near-infrared photons, (2) presence of an anchoring group that can strongly attach to the mesoporous oxide layer, and (3) an energy level that is between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) for an efficient electron injection from the valence to the conduction bands of the semiconductors [13]. Superior <b>sensitizers</b> should also be able to absorb all of the light that strikes below a threshold wavelength (920  nm) and convert standard air mass (AM) of 1.5 sunlight into electricity, so that upon excitation, these <b>sensitizers</b> could inject electrons from the dyes into the solid materials with a quantum yield of unity [14]. In considering natural dyes as one of the parameters in the development of DSSCs, verifying the efficiency with respect to processes such as (1) the absorption of incident photons by the dye molecules, (2) conversion of photons to electron–hole pairs, and (3) separation and collection, before choosing pigments as <b>sensitizers</b> is important [15].|$|R
