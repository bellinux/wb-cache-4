5|$|Vegetation {{clearing}} and cattle trampling river banks create severe <b>siltation,</b> which fill in pools, degrade river ecosystems and make {{rivers and streams}} uninhabitable for Murray cod. This is exacerbated by removal of riparian (riverbank) vegetation which causes <b>siltation</b> and degrades river ecosystems in many ways.|$|E
5|$|<b>Siltation</b> {{during the}} rainy season due to soil erosion of the denuded hills and {{inappropriate}} agricultural practices flowing through the three feeder streams namely, the Gomukh, the Nag Pahar and Savitri.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of alkalinity in Roaring Creek upstream of Lick Run is 9 milligrams per liter. Many nearby watersheds have been rendered nearly devoid of aquatic life due to acid mine drainage caused by coal mining. However, Roaring Creek {{has not been}} affected by this, {{although it has been}} still impacted by human land use. Sedimentation, <b>siltation,</b> and agricultural impacts occur in the watershed. The only impaired stream in the watershed is a small unnamed tributary that is impaired by <b>siltation.</b> From a chemical standpoint, Roaring Creek is infertile.|$|E
5|$|There is {{significant}} stormwater flow and sedimentation in Mahoning Creek, {{as well as}} agricultural and urban runoff. However, the creek is less environmentally damaged than the nearby Chillisquaque Creek. Mahoning Creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired downstream of Kase Run, part of which is also impaired. Additionally, the tributary Mauses Creek {{is considered to be}} impaired, as are {{the upper reaches of the}} tributary Sechler Run. The cause of the impairment of Mahoning Creek is <b>siltation</b> and the source is agriculture and urban runoff/storm sewers. Sections of all three of its named tributaries are impaired, with the cause being <b>siltation</b> and the source being agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{have died}} out {{in many of}} their upland habitats, {{particularly}} in the southern Murray-Darling basin, due {{to a combination of}} overfishing, <b>siltation,</b> dams and weirs blocking migration, pollution from arsenic-based sheep-dips, mining, and in some cases, introduced trout stockings, which causes competition between juvenile Murray cod and introduced trout species.|$|E
5|$|The harbour {{cost more}} than {{anticipated}} and high rates were levied to repay loans, reducing any benefit the new harbour had at drawing companies back from Liverpool. In 1848 the city council bought the docks company to force down the rates. They employed Isambard Kingdom Brunel to make improvements, including new lock gates, a dredger and sluice gates designed to reduce <b>siltation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the <b>siltation</b> of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles {{at or near the}} surface.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the construction of Ithai Barrage has altered the Loktak Lake and its ecosystem. <b>Siltation</b> has reduced the water holding capacity and has consequently had a negative impact on the power generation capacity at the Loktak Hydro Electric Power Project. Thinning of the phumdi in the Keibul Lamjao area has affected the habitat of the sangai, and other aquafauna, avifauna and flora are on the decline; the 35 species (5 mammals, 3 birds, 9 reptiles, 3 amphibians, 12 fishes, 2 molluscs and 1 annelid) are reported to be disappearing gradually.|$|E
5|$|Mahoning Creek is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired by <b>siltation.</b> The main rock formations in the watershed include the Trimmers Rock Formation, the Clinton Group, the Catskill Formation, the Hamilton Group, the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation, the Onondaga and Old Port Formation, and the Wills Creek Formation. The main soils include the Berks-Weikert-Alvira series, the Chenango-Pope-Holly series, the Clymer-Buchanan-Norwich series, and the Leck Kill-Meckesville-Calvin series. Most of the watershed is forested or agricultural land, {{but there is some}} developed land.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{and their}} {{attendant}} anemone fish can make attractive aquarium exhibits {{and both are}} often harvested from the wild as adults or juveniles. These fishing activities significantly impact the populations of anemones and anemone fish by drastically reducing the densities of each in exploited areas. Besides their collection from the wild for use in reef aquaria, sea anemones are also threatened by alterations to their environment. Those living in shallow water coastal locations are affected directly by pollution and <b>siltation,</b> and indirectly by the effect these have on their photosynthetic symbionts and the prey on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|The water {{also appears}} murky {{due to a}} high level of turbidity; however, this is not usually a health risk. However, the turbidity, which is caused by wind, {{prevents}} photosynthetic stabilisation. <b>Siltation</b> is not considered a major problem and is only a factor in the East Basin, but dredging is not required. The problem has eased with the construction of the Googong Dam, and the spectre of heavy metal pollution has receded, partly due to the closure of some lead mines upstream. However, leaching and groundwater leakage still causes some pollution. Rubbish, oil and sediment traps have been set up at the incoming openings to the lake to minimise pollution.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the upper}} tributaries of Shamokin Creek are in the Western Middle Anthracite Coalfield and {{nearly all of the}} streams {{in this part of the}} {{watershed}} are impacted by mining, except for Furnace Run. Various mine drainage sites occur in the watersheds of all other streams in the upper Shamokin Creek watershed. None of the tributaries in the lower reaches of the Shamokin Creek watershed are affected by mining. Four tributaries of Shamokin CreekLick Creek, Millers Run, Bennys Run, and Trout Runare not designated as impaired waterbodies by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Another five tributariesNorth Branch Shamokin Creek, Locust Creek, Quaker Run, Coal Run, and Carbon Run are impaired by metals due to abandoned mine drainage. Furnace Run is impaired by channelization and habitat alteration, while Little Shamokin Creek and its tributary Plum Creek are impaired by <b>siltation,</b> organic enrichment, and low levels of dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The fauna {{includes}} {{several species of}} zooplankton and benthic animals. Since the lake is oligotrophic (nutrient-poor), the native fish fauna is relatively scarce, and the only endemics are Rasbora tobana (strictly speaking near-endemic, since also found in some tributary rivers that run into the lake) and Neolissochilus thienemanni, locally known as the Batak fish. The latter species is threatened by deforestation (causing <b>siltation),</b> pollution, changes in water level and the numerous fish species that have been introduced to the lake. Other native fishes include species such as Aplocheilus panchax, Nemacheilus pfeifferae, Homaloptera gymnogaster, Channa gachua, Channa striata, Clarias batrachus, Barbonymus gonionotus, Barbonymus schwanenfeldii, Danio albolineatus, Osteochilus vittatus, Puntius binotatus, Rasbora jacobsoni, Tor tambra, Betta imbellis, Betta taeniata and Monopterus albus. Among the many introduced species are Anabas testudineus, Oreochromis mossambicus, Oreochromis niloticus, Ctenopharyngodon idella, Cyprinus carpio, Osphronemus goramy, Trichogaster pectoralis, Trichopodus trichopterus, Poecilia reticulata and Xiphophorus hellerii.|$|E
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded water circulation and caused an increase in <b>siltation</b> and deposit of pollutants in the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E
25|$|When {{water flows}} {{it has the}} ability to {{transport}} particles heavier than itself downstream. This has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations, particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high <b>siltation.</b> <b>Siltation</b> can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam. Eventually, some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail.|$|E
25|$|When {{suspended}} {{sediment transport}} is increased due to human activities, causing environmental problems including the filling of channels, {{it is called}} <b>siltation</b> after the grain-size fraction dominating the process.|$|E
25|$|Beaver Run has no named tributaries. However, it {{does have}} a number of unnamed tributaries. Their stream codes are 18995, 18996, 18997, and 64983. All are {{designated}} as impaired by <b>siltation</b> due to agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Hicks Creek {{experiences}} {{low flow}} in dry weather. However, {{it also is}} prone to flash flooding. The creek also experiences nonpoint source pollution, as well as <b>siltation,</b> sedimentation, and streambank erosion. In the 1980s, hazardous waste was observed in the creek.|$|E
25|$|Fidlers Run is not {{designated}} as an impaired waterbody. Some of its unnamed tributaries are not {{designated as}} impaired waterbodies. However, reaches {{of some of}} the stream's unnamed tributaries are in fact designated as impaired, due to <b>siltation</b> from agriculture and grazing-related agriculture.|$|E
25|$|The snail tolerates <b>siltation,</b> {{thrives in}} {{disturbed}} watersheds, and benefits from high nutrient flows allowing for filamentous green algae growth. It occurs amongst macrophytes and prefers littoral zones in lakes or slow streams with silt and organic matter substrates, but tolerates high flow environments {{where it can}} burrow into the sediment.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{introduced}} Nile perch (Lates niloticus), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), {{and water}} hyacinth, deforestation {{that led to}} water <b>siltation,</b> and overfishing, many Lake Victoria cichlid species have become extinct or been drastically reduced. By around 1980, lake fisheries yielded only 1% cichlids, a drastic decline from 80% in earlier years.|$|E
25|$|Logging of the {{extensive}} forests in the Great Lakes region removed riparian and adjacent tree cover over rivers and streams, which provide shade, moderating water temperatures in fish spawning grounds. Removal of trees also destabilized the soil, with greater volumes washed into stream beds causing <b>siltation</b> of gravel beds, and more frequent flooding.|$|E
25|$|The Ganges basin is home {{to about}} 30 fish species that are listed as {{threatened}} with the primary issues being overfishing (sometimes illegal), pollution, water abstraction, <b>siltation</b> and invasive species. Among the threatened species is the critically endangered Ganges shark (Glyphis gangeticus). Several fish species migrate between different sections of the river, but these movements may be prevented by the building of dams.|$|E
25|$|DVC {{is working}} on the {{proposal}} for a third dam across the Barakar at Balpahari in Jharkhand. Planned as part of its network of dams and barrages in the valley region, the Balpahari project was conceived with the objective of reducing <b>siltation</b> problems at Maithon, increasing the reach of canal irrigation and adding to hydro-electric generation capacity by 20MW from the existing 144 MW.|$|E
25|$|As of 2004, East Branch Chillisquaque Creek is {{impaired}} by sediment due to <b>siltation.</b> The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified it as {{needing a}} total maximum daily load. The creek's watershed was ranked eighth for quality {{out of ten}} sub-watersheds of Chillisquaque Creek. No part of any stream in the watershed meets the water quality standards of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.|$|E
25|$|In the United States and Canada, areas home to {{the most}} diverse {{freshwater}} mussel fauna in the world, there are 297 known freshwater mussel taxa. Of the 297 known species, 213 (71.7%) taxa are listed as endangered, threatened, of special concern. The main factors contributing to the decline of freshwater mussels include destruction from dams, increased <b>siltation,</b> channel modification, {{and the introduction of}} invasive species like the Zebra mussel.|$|E
25|$|A major {{contributor}} to the environmental degradation and barrier to the regeneration of forests was the grazing of domestic animals. Animals grazed and destroyed land areas unsuitable for cultivation. The consumption of hillside plants and young trees caused erosion, stripping hillsides of soils and eventually exposing bare rock. Silt and gravel would wash down off the hills and mountains creating other problems such as flooding, <b>siltation,</b> and filled-in marshlands.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{factors are}} thought to have contributed to the decline of Freshwater Catfish populations in the Murray-Darling Basin since the 1970s. These include habitat {{degradation}} and barriers to movement, and increased predation by and competition with introduced species such as carp (which has similar feeding habits) and Redfin. Severe <b>siltation</b> also probably severely impacts upon the species spawning by smothering the rocks and pebbles they use to build nests.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas where}} {{agriculture}} is more intense and developed, {{there are serious}} problems of soil erosion, <b>siltation</b> and sedimentation of streams and rivers, and pollution with pesticides. In parts of the savannas, where irrigated soybean production expanded in the 1980s, the water table has been affected. Expansion of pastures for cattle raising has reduced natural biodiversity in the savannas. Swine effluents constitute a serious environmental problem in Santa Catarina in the South.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} lake {{to highlight}} located near Guatemala City is the once pristine Lake Amatitlán {{which is now}} long degraded from years of domestic and industrial dumping, and deforestation. Each year large quantities of untreated sewage, industrial effluent and around 500,000 tons of sediment are carried into Lake Amatitlán through the lake's primary inflow source, the Villalobos River, causing high levels of water pollution and an accelerated rate of eutrophication and <b>siltation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Erosion {{accelerated}} up to twentyfold in the 3rd century, creating unusable marshlands, which spread {{diseases such}} as malaria. Flooding from runoff disrupted water supply to natural springs and rivers, but also increased <b>siltation</b> to coastal areas and harbors at river deltas. Rains washed away the unprotected earth and greatly altered coastlines, in some cases, pushing them many miles farther out to sea {{as in the case}} around the mouths of the Po River.|$|E
25|$|Elimia virginica {{is found}} in {{freshwater}} rivers and streams with cobble bottoms and boulders. (Pleurocerids are usually found in lotic erosional environments, in riffles or shoals with rock or sand substrate, and especially frequently on rocks in slower areas of medium size reaches.) Elimia virginica usually inhabits slow to medium velocity rivers and streams with firm and clean gravel, cobble and rock substrate. Pleurocerids in general are sensitive to abiotic stresses, and Elimia virginica is not tolerant to <b>siltation.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of {{the better}} {{examples}} of a tidal bore {{can be seen on}} the Shubenacadie River near the town of Truro and the village of Maitland, where local ecotourism operators offer the chance to experience rafting the bore upriver. Another good example of a tidal bore may be viewed on the Salmon River in the town of Truro. The once-famous tidal bores on the Petitcodiac and Avon rivers have been severely disrupted as a result of causeway construction in the 1960s–1970s which have caused excessive <b>siltation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The area {{features}} three rare fish species: the venomous stonecat (Noturus flavus), {{the only}} catfish species in Alberta, St. Mary's Sculpin (Cottus bairdi punctulatus), {{and the western}} silvery minnow (Hybognathus argyritis). All three are under threatened status in Alberta, and the western silvery minnow was upgraded to endangered in Canada by COSEWIC in April 2008. Their greatest threats are habitat alteration or loss, changes in water flow or drought water levels, increased <b>siltation,</b> elevated water temperatures, surface water extraction, dam construction, and for the western silvery minnow, introduction of predatory fish species.|$|E
25|$|The slow flowing {{nature of}} the streams {{caused a lot of}} <b>siltation</b> in the pool, this {{combined}} with it being used as a sewer for the Close caused it to become dirty. In 1772 the pool was cleaned and landscaped by the Corporation. Poet Anna Seward was instrumental in landscaping the pool into a serpentine shape and developing a ‘New Walk’ along its southern bank. By the mid 19th century it had become dirty again and five feet of mud was dredged in 1855. During these works cannonballs and shells from the Civil War were found in the mud.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the river channels flowing through Nantes were increasingly perceived as hampering the city's comfort and economic development. Sand <b>siltation</b> required dredging, which weakened the quays; one quay collapsed in 1924. Embankments were overcrowded with railways, roads and tramways. Between 1926 and 1946, most of the channels were filled in and their water diverted. Large thoroughfares replaced the channels, altering the urban landscape. Feydeau and Gloriette Islands in the old town were attached to the north bank, and the other islands in the Loire were formed into the Isle of Nantes.|$|E
