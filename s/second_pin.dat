40|$|The use of {{external}} fixation devices in orthopedic surgery {{is very common}} in open tibial fractures. A properly applied fixator may improve the healing process while one improperly applied might delay the healing process. The several external fixator systems used in clinical today, can be categorized into uniplanar–unilateral, uniplanar–bilateral, biplanar and multiplanar. The stability on the fracture focus and, therefore, the fracture healing process, is related with the type {{of external}} fixator configuration that is selected. The aim {{of this study is to}} discuss the principles for the successful application of unilateral–uniplanar external fixation, the assembly of its components, for the case of a transverse fractures using computational models. In this context, the fixation stiffness characteristics are evaluated using a simplified 1 D finite element model for the tibia and external fixator. The beams are modeled with realistic cross-sectional geometry and material properties instead of a simplified model. The VABS (the Variational Asymptotic Beam Section analysis) methodology is used to compute the cross-sectional model for the generalized Timoshenko model, which was embedded in the finite element solver FEAP. The use of Timoshenko beam theory allows accounting for several kinds of loads, including torsion moments. Optimal design is performed with respect to the assembly of fixator components using a genetic algorithm. The optimization procedure is based on the evaluation of an objective function, which is dependent on the displacement at the fracture focus. The initial and optimal results are compared by performing a 3 D analysis, for which different three-dimensional finite element models are created. The geometrical model of a tibia is created on the basis of data acquired by CAT scan, made for a healthy tibia of a 22 year old male. The 3 D comparison of the 1 D optimal results show a clear improvement on the objective function for the several load cases and, therefore, it is shown that appropriate selection of the external fixator geometrical features can lead to an improvement on the stability of the external fixator. The results obtained show that the optimal position of the side beam and the first pin should be as close as possible to the bone interface and as close as possible to the fracture focus, respectively. Concerning the <b>second</b> <b>pin,</b> it should be placed away from the first pin in case of flexion loads, to axial and torsion loads the <b>second</b> <b>pin</b> should be placed near the first pin...|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{any other}} battery charger, {{this project is}} about the {{combination}} of battery charger circuit with alarm circuit. The main objective of this project is the alarm will send signal to the user. Thus, the user will know that the batteries are already fully charged. It consists of 3 segments, the power supply, charging circuit and alarm circuit. In this project, the charging process is focus more on AA batteries. The heart of the circuit located at LM 324. It is the segment that controlling the charging process of the whole circuit. 2 pins are required. First pin (pin 12) is for Upper Limit Set, while the <b>second</b> <b>pin</b> (pin 9) is for lower limit set. This both pin sending the signal as a reference value. The upper limit send an information that the batteries is overcharged while the lower limit send the information about batteries deep discharge. Both of them are controlled by a potentiometer. When this is happen, the LM 324 will send signal to the transistor. This transistor than operates thus energizes the relay coil. When the relay retracted, the charging process is halt {{and at the same}} time, operates the buzzer. The buzzer will continue to ring until the charger is turn off...|$|E

40|$|Background: Alopecia Areata (AA) is {{a disease}} {{characterized}} by hair loss that is widely believed to be autoimmune in origin. Thus treatment is generally aimed in this direction using immune inhibitors such as steroids and PUVA. Objective: To describe a variant of AA, Pseudo Alopecia Areata, caused by a particular cupola pin holder (tic-tac) and to offer a non-pharmacological treatment option (NPT). Methods: A prospective open label study in 37 Jewish religious patients (34 males, 3 females, mean 35 ^ 2 years), previously diagnosed and treated for scalp AA were randomly referred {{to one of the}} three NPT intervention methods: small cupola held by two pins, large cupola held by one pin and similar cupola held by a different pin. Results: Three of the ten patients (33. 3 %) from the first group developed secondary AA from the additional pin. No changes were seen in the second group. Ten of the seventeen patients (58. 8 %) from the third group achieved immediate improvement subsequent to replacing the original pin with a new one on a larger cupola. Conclusions: Conservative pharmacological treatment failed to repair the lesions. The addition of a <b>second</b> <b>pin</b> caused an additional lesion. In contrast, replacing the cupola with a larger one and the original pin-fastener with a different type, successfully reduced the lesions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The arthroscopic M-ACT {{technique}} is applica-ble for defects at the femoral condyle up to 5 cm. The {{size of the}} defect has to be assessed with a speciWc scaled, per-cutaneously inserted needle. Then an 8 mm water-stop-can-nula is positioned in a suprameniscal portal. The chondrocyte seeded matrix is trimmed to size the defect. The scaVold is introduced in the joint through the cannula and placed into the defect with a blunt arthroscopic grasp instrument to prevent damage of the scaVold. Then a spe-ciWc drill guide is inserted through an additional anterome-dial portal to {{place it on the}} scaVold in a perpendicular angle. The position of the drill guide should not be changed during the next two steps. It may be helpful to hold the matrix in place with a probe inserted through the cannula. A 1. 5 mm K-wire is drilled at least 16 mm into the sub-chondral bone. Then the biodegradable pin (length 16 mm) is placed in the drill guide and carefully hammered into the subchondral bone. The joint is Xexed so that the drill guide can be placed on the posterior end of the scaVold. Another hole is drilled with the K-wire and a <b>second</b> <b>pin</b> is inserted. Finally the stability of the matrix is tested with a probe and the joint is mobilized...|$|E
40|$|Ultra high {{molecular}} weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) wear debris {{has been shown to}} be a major cause of long term failure of total joint replacements. In vitro studies have shown that not only is the size and shape of the particles important for cellular response but also the volumetric concentration of the particles. Recently, crosslinking has been extensively introduced to reduce the wear of UHMWPE. In this study the wear and wear debris of non-crosslinked and crosslinked UHMWPE were compared. The materials examined were UHMWPE GUR 1050, non crosslinked, moderately crosslinked - 5 MRad and highly crosslinked - IOMRad. The wear was examined on a multidirectional pin on plate rig. The first test looked at the wear of the UHMWPE's with different serum concentrations. The effect of counterface roughness with high multidirectionality against different counterfaces was then examined. The second test examined the effect of different counterface surfaces at lower multidirectionality. The debris produced was then analysed. The wear results from the first pin on plate study showed that serum concentration had a significant effect on the wear rate of non-crosslinked U}IMWPE. The high serum concentration resulted in a much higher wear rate than the lower serum concentration for the non-crosslinked UIHMWPE. The crosslinked UHMWPE's did not show any significant difference in wear rate with serum concentration. The results from the different counterface conditions showed that highly crosslinked UHMWPE significantly reduced wear against smooth and scratched counterfaces. The <b>second</b> <b>pin</b> on plate study showed that all the U MWPE's had lower wear rates than the previous study because of reduced cross shear frictional energy. As with the previous study the highly crosslinked UHMWPE had significantly lower wear rates against all the counterfaces, and there was no significant difference between the OMRad and 5 MRad UHMWPE. The reduction in wear rate found with the highly crosslinked UHMWPE was dependent on kinematics with less reduction with lower levels of cross shear frictional energy. The wear debris from the high multidirectional study on smooth and highly scratched plates was analysed. The use of field emission gun SEM revealed nanometre sized particles for the first time in all three materials under both counterface conditions. No significant difference was found in the percentage number and percentage area of the particles from any of the materials against any of the counterfaces although more larger wear particles were observed from the scratched counterface debris. The actual volumes of the particles showed that the highly crosslinked UHMWPE had a significantly lower volume in the 0. 1 - 1. 0 μm size range. This was an important observation as this is the most biologically active size range. The specific biological activity did not show any significant difference between the materials. The functional biological activity which takes into account the wear volume showed that the highly crosslinked UHMWPE had a lower FBA for debris from both the smooth and scratched counterfaces. The debris from the scratched tests had a higher FBA for all the materials because of the increased wear rates with the scratched counterface.
