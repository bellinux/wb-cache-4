The climbing stage involves secondary growth of the stem, which can be a standard or anomalous (Isnard and Silk 2009). Morphological variation in liana stems is primarily associated with the geometry of the phloem and xylem, and irregular shapes within the stems are classified into cambial variants (Angyalossy et al. 2015). The diversity of liana stem shapes, structures, and cambial variants has been recently reviewed (Angyalossy et al. 2012), including those of Piperaceae.|$|E

40|$|Capacitive {{displacement}} sensors {{have many}} applications where non-contact, high precision measurement of a surface is required. Because of their non-contact nature {{they can easily}} measure conductive surfaces that are flexible or otherwise unable to be measured using a contact probe. Since {{the output of the}} capacitance gage is electrical, data points can be collected quickly and averaged to improve statistics. It is often necessary for capacitive displacement sensors to gage the distance from a curved (non-flat) surface. Although displacements can easily be detected, the calibration of this output can vary considerably from the flat case. Since a capacitance gage is typically factory-calibrated against a flat reference, the experimental output contains errors in both gain and linearity. A series of calibration corrections is calculated for rectifying this output. Capacitance gages are also limited in their overall displacement travel. A <b>support</b> <b>stage</b> is described that, along with control electronics, allow the properties of the capacitance gage to be combined with an interferometer to overcome this displacement limitation. Finally, an application is proposed that would make use of the capacitance sensor and <b>support</b> <b>stage</b> assembly...|$|E

40|$|The final {{technical}} report for the Pegasus plow, a stalk and root embedding apparatus, describes progress from the development stage to the product <b>support</b> <b>stage.</b> The US Department of Agriculture - Agriculture Research Service (ARS) {{is now in the}} second year of a three year study comparing the Pegasus to conventional tillage. So far, no downside has been with the Pegasus and the following benefits have been documented: (1) Energy savings of 65. 0 kilowatt hours per hectare over conventional tillage. This is when the Pegasus plow is used to bury whole stalks, and represents a 70 % savings over conventional tillage (92. 5 kilowatt hours per hectare). (2) Four to seven fewer passes of tillage, depending on the particular situation. This represents a substantial time savings to farmers. (3) So far, no differences in cotton yields. Recent cotton boll counts in one study indicate a higher yield potential with the Pegasus. (4) No disease problems. (5) Significantly higher levels of organic matter in the soil. A hypothesis of the study is that whole stalk burial may reduce plant disease problems. This hypothesis has not yet been proven. (6) Significantly higher levels of nitrate nitrogen. Total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen trended higher but were not significantly different. This shows that whole stalk burial does not adversely affect the nitrogen cycle in the soil and may actually improve it.

40|$|Stage {{theories}} {{propose that}} individuals pass through different stages {{on their way}} toward behavior change. The present study examines stage-specific prediction patterns of social– cognitive variables (risk perception, outcome expectancies, perceived self-efficacy, action planning and social support) regarding transi-tions between the three stages of the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA; preintention, intention and action stage). In an online study (n 5 494) on fruit and vegetable intake, social– cognitive variables and stages were assessed at baseline and stage transitions 4 weeks later. Tran-sitions between the preintention, intention and action stage were predicted by social–cognitive variables using binary and multinomial logistic regression analyses. Stage-specific prediction patterns emerged for stage progression and stage regression. Outcome expectancies predicted pro-gression from the preintention stage, whereas so-cial support predicted progression to the action stage. Low levels of planningwere associatedwith relapse to thepreintention and the intention stage. Self-efficacy emerged as a universal predictor of stage transitions. Findings support not only {{the usefulness of the}} stage construct for describing health behavior change but also the validity of the HAPAvariables as predictors of stage transi-tions.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the capacity of the TTM for predicting physical activity stage transitions among adults (≥ 18 years of age) with type 1 (N[*]=[*] 517) or type 2 (N[*]=[*] 1, 157) diabetes over 6 months. Participants were identified by a random-digit dialing telephone protocol through the Alberta Diabetes Registry. Assessments of TTM's stage of physical activity behavior change, self-efficacy, pros and cons, cognitive Processes of Change, and behavioral Processes of Change at baseline (time 1) and 6 months (time 2) were assessed by questionnaire. Over this time period, participants were categorized as having regressed (moved back at least one stage), remained (no stage change), or progressed (moved forward at least one stage). Baseline TTM constructs were analyzed for their ability to predict transition over 6 months. Moderate support for the TTM constructs in predicting physical activity stage transitions was found. Self-efficacy, pros, and behavioral Processes of Change hold relatively strong predictive power for stage progression over 6 months, with very few differences found between the types 1 and 2 diabetes groups. The capacity of the model in predicting stage transition is partially supported. When promoting physical activity among adults with diabetes, targeting self-efficacy, pros, and cognitive Processes of Change may favorably <b>support</b> <b>stage</b> transition in the pre-action stages, while strategies to enhance the behavioral Processes of Change may be appropriate for the Action and Maintenance stages...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a multifaceted {{effort to develop}} a system that allows electrodiagnostic clinicians to perform a quantitative analysis of needle detected electromyographic (EMG) signals for characterization of neuromuscular disorders. Currently, the most widely adopted practise for evaluation of patients with suspected neuromuscular disorders is based on qualitative visual and auditory assessment of EMG signals. The resulting characterizations from this qualitative assessment are criticized for being subjective and highly dependent on the skill and experience of the examiner. The proposed system can be decomposed functionally into three stages: (1) extracting relevant information from the EMG signals, (2) representing the extracted information in formats suitable for qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative assessment, and (3) supporting the clinical decision, i. e., characterizing the examined muscle by estimating the likelihood of it being affected by a specific category of neuromuscular disorders. The main contribution of the thesis to the extraction stage {{is the development of}} an automated decomposition algorithm specifically tailored for characterization of neuromuscular disorders. The algorithm focuses on identifying as many representative motor unit potential trains as possible in times comparable to the times needed to complete a qualitative assessment. The identified trains are shown to reliably capture important aspects of the motor unit potential morphology and morphological stability. With regards to the representation stage, the thesis proposes ten new quantitative EMG features that are shown to be discriminative among the different disease categories. Along with eight traditional features, the features can be grouped into subsets, where each subset reflects a different aspect of the underlying motor unit structure and/or function. A muscle characterization obtained using a feature set in which every relevant aspect is included using the most representative feature is more structured, simple, and generalizable. All the investigated features are clinically relevant. An examiner can easily validate their values by visual inspection; interpret them from an anatomical, physiological, and pathological basis; and is aware of their limitations and dependence on the acquisition setup. The second main contribution to the representation stage is the evaluation of the possibility of detecting neurogenic disorders using a newly proposed set of quantitative features describing the firing patterns of the identified motor units. The last contribution to the representation stage is the development of novel methods that allow an examiner to detect contributions from fibres close to the detection surface of a needle electrode and to track them across a motor unit potential train. The work in this thesis related to the decision <b>support</b> <b>stage</b> aims at improving existing methods for obtaining transparent muscle characterization. Transparent methods do not only estimate the likelihood of the muscle being affected by a specific disorder, but also induce a set of rules explaining the likelihood estimates. The results presented in this thesis show that remodelling the characterization problem using an appropriate binarization mapping can overcome the decrease in accuracy associated with quantizing features, which is used to induce transparency rules. To attain the above mentioned objectives, different signal processing and machine learning methods are utilized and extended. This includes spectral clustering, Savitzky-Golay filtering, dynamic time warping, support vector machines, classification based on event association rules and Gaussian mixture models. The performance of the proposed methods has been evaluated with four different sets of examined limb muscles (342 muscles in total). Also, it has been evaluated using simulated EMG signals calculated using physiologically and anatomically sound models. A system capable of achieving the aforementioned objectives is expected to promote further clinical adoption of quantitative electromyographic techniques. These techniques have potential advantages over existing qualitative assessments including resolving equivocal cases, formalizing communication and evaluating prognosis...|$|E
