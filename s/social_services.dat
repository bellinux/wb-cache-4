40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine, describe and analyze the patterns of <b>social</b> <b>service</b> curricula in Uruguay. This exploratory study obtained data about structured and unstructured <b>social</b> <b>service</b> education, and the educational and professional backgrounds of educators and <b>social</b> <b>service</b> workers. The research process included: (1) administration of a questionnaire to University of the Republic's School of <b>Social</b> <b>Service</b> (EUSS) faculty to determine their perceptions of School curriculum, and their personal backgrounds; (2) administration of a questionnaire to <b>social</b> <b>service</b> workers in Montevideo to determine their perceptions of their professional education, and their personal backgrounds; (3) analysis of structured <b>social</b> <b>service</b> at EUSS and the Institute of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters’ (IFCL) Department of <b>Social</b> <b>Service</b> (formerly School of <b>Social</b> <b>Service</b> of Uruguay); (4) analysis of in-service <b>social</b> <b>service</b> education offered in Montevideo; and (5) observation of and participation in <b>social</b> <b>service</b> activities essentially in Montevideo. Forty-four faculty members of EUSS and one hundred and twenty <b>social</b> <b>service</b> workers responded to questionnaires. The results of the present research may be summarized thusly: (1) the <b>social</b> <b>service</b> professional respondents demonstrated a complete dedication to their profession and to the well-being of less fortunate members of Uruguayan society; (2) perceptions held by EUSS faculty about twenty-two courses of the EUSS 1979 curriculum were: nine courses, satisfactory in content; twelve courses, improve content; and one course, considerable content improvement required; (3) <b>social</b> <b>service</b> curricula of EUSS and IFCL differed notably in their requirements in social sciences, methodology and special course work; (4) the curricular mission of the Institute for Domestic Social Training (IFFS) appeared overly concerned with the family unit; (5) EUSS practicum training was poorly supervised by faculty, a broad spectrum of training sites was not used, and agency personnel were not utilized sufficiently for supervision of interns; (6) in-service educational offerings were limited in scope and number, and schools of <b>social</b> <b>service</b> were not meeting the continuing education needs of professional workers; (7) rural <b>social</b> <b>service</b> needs were not being met by structured and in-service education, nor was sufficient research being done about rural social problems; (8) insufficient research was being directed toward the indigenization and reconceptualization of <b>social</b> <b>service</b> curricula; (9) EUSS instructors were all part-time and limited in post-graduate training; (10) interest in postgraduate courses and a masters' degree program was high among EUSS faculty and <b>social</b> <b>service</b> professionals; and (11) graduates of Uruguayan schools of <b>social</b> <b>service</b> were limited in their ability to conduct independent research or to accept mid-level administrative positions due to minimal training in these two educational areas. EUSS faculty and <b>social</b> <b>service</b> professional defined <b>social</b> <b>service</b> priority curricular areas of emphasis for the 1980 as health, primary and secondary education, children, housing, the family, and social rehabilitation. Several conclusions and recommendations were derived from this research, including: (1) EUSS and IFCL curricula differed in emphasis on the social sciences and methodology courses; (2) <b>social</b> <b>service</b> education should be divided, and undergraduate education should be the responsibility of IFCL, and post-graduate education, as a structured masters’ degree program, the responsibility of the University of the Republic through a newly founded Graduate School of <b>Social</b> <b>Service.</b> In-service education should be a cooperative program involving all public and private <b>social</b> <b>service</b> educational institutions; (3) <b>social</b> <b>service</b> educators and professional workers should unite to influence national social policy formation; and (4) <b>social</b> <b>service</b> educators and professionals should give high priority to research to meet future needs of the Uruguayan society...|$|R

40|$|The Scandinavian welfare states – Denmark, Norway, and Sweden – {{are usually}} assumed to {{constitute}} a coherent and unique <b>social</b> <b>service</b> model, characterized among other things by {{a high level of}} universalism. This thesis questions the existence of such a model. It presents cross-country data, which demonstrate that only Denmark complies with the image of the Scandinavian <b>social</b> <b>service</b> model, while Norway and Sweden deviate significantly. Norwegian childcare services and Swedish elderlycare services do not stand out as particularly universalistic in comparison with other Western European countries. Altogether it seems that the Scandinavian countries in terms of <b>social</b> <b>service</b> universalism form a less coherent group than often believed. The main aim of this thesis is to explain this lack of coherence among the Scandinavian <b>social</b> <b>service</b> systems and to understand variations between different service fields. Two main questions are raised: First, why do the Scandinavian countries display different levels of <b>social</b> <b>service</b> universalism? Second, why are there different developments in the Swedish welfare state as to the level of <b>social</b> <b>service</b> universalism between the two major <b>social</b> <b>service</b> fields of childcare and elderlycare? In order to answer these questions, an institutionalist approach is chosen, focusing on the impact of institutional fragmentation in the implementation process between the central government level on one hand and local governments and NGOs on the other. It is hypothesized that a low level of institutional fragmentation implying a concentration of policy-specific authority on the central state level is a positive precondition for the achievement of <b>social</b> <b>service</b> universalism, whereas a high level of institutional fragmentation providing municipalities and/or NGOs with veto points against universalistic <b>social</b> <b>service</b> policies instead has a detrimental impact on the prospects of <b>social</b> <b>service</b> universalism. Empirical data drawing on public documents and national statistics support this hypothesis: In those countries and in those <b>social</b> <b>service</b> fields where a strong concentration of implementative decision making exists, a stronger level of <b>social</b> <b>service</b> universalism has been accomplished than in those where the implementative decision making is heavily fragmented between the central government on one hand and municipalities and/or NGOs on the other. This finding tentatively indicates that the intra-Scandinavian variations of <b>social</b> <b>service</b> universalism across countries and across policy fields are indeed related to different levels of institutional fragmentation in the implementation process...|$|R
