5|$|As an {{implement}} {{of war and}} hunting, javelin throwing began in prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the javelin was the <b>second</b> <b>throwing</b> event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance. The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the foul line.|$|E

He also competed at the 2011 Toronto International Track & Field Games, placing <b>second</b> <b>throwing</b> 77.72 meters (255' feet). At the 2011 Pan American Games, Cyrus earned the silver medal with a season-best throw of 82.24 meters (269'10" [...] feet), also {{achieving}} the 2012 Summer Olympics A standard. He placed fifth in javelin at the U.S. Olympic trials, but {{was one of the}} three javelin throwers who had the Olympic A standard. In the Javelin Throw at the 2012 Summer Olympics, Cyrus placed thirty-second in the qualifying with a throw of 75.76 meters.|$|E

5000|$|Lowe was {{relieved}} after [...] innings. After walking Aubrey Huff and allowing an infield single to Buster Posey, Bobby Cox {{made his way}} out to the mound, apparently to remove Lowe from the game. However, after talking to him, Cox elected to leave Lowe in, prompting huge cheers from the Atlanta fans. The next batter, Pat Burrell, walked on a 3-1 pitch near the inside corner and Lowe's night was done. He struck out eight while allowing only two hits and walking two. Braves' relievers Peter Moylan and Jonny Venters could not hold the lead as the Giants scored two runs {{in the top of the}} seventh inning on Juan Uribe's RBI fielder's choice and Cody Ross' RBI single. The Braves might have been able to escape the one-out, bases-loaded jam, however, Álex González's throwing error, his second in the game, cost them. Both errors were debatable. The first, was a ball hit in the hole he didn't field cleanly with the speedy Andrés Torres running. The second, was again, another crucial controversial call that went against the Braves in the series. With two on and one out and a weakly hit groundball, González elected to go to <b>second,</b> <b>throwing</b> it high, causing Omar Infante to edge up, however, the umpire ruled he came off the base.|$|E
50|$|The Cardinals {{added on}} five more {{runs in the}} fifth inning. Yadier Molina singled to right field and reached second base on Yasiel Puig's <b>second</b> <b>{{throwing}}</b> error of the night. David Freese singled to advance Molina to third base and Matt Adams drove him home with a double in to make it 5-0 Cardinals. Kershaw left the game with runners on second and third after throwing 98 pitches {{and was replaced by}} reliever Ronald Belisario. Shane Robinson came {{up to the plate and}} reached second base on a choice out by shortstop Hanley Ramírez to catcher A.J. Ellis, who tagged out David Freese in a run down between third and home. With runners still on second and third, Pete Kozma was intentionally walked for the second time that night. Then Michael Wacha hit Belisario's pitch and reached first base on a fielder's choice by second baseman Mark Ellis who allowed Matt Adams to score after hesitating on a throw to home, making the score 6-0 Cardinals. Belisario was replaced by relief pitcher J.P. Howell who allowed Robinson and Kozma to score on a sacrifice fly by Carpenter and a wild pitch to Molina respectively, stretching the lead to 8-0. Carlos Beltran closed the door on the Dodgers postseason by singling to left field and scoring Wacha for the final run of the game, giving the Cardinals a commanding 9-0 lead. The Dodgers eked out just one more hit on a double by catcher A.J. Ellis and the Cardinals pitching staff retired the next twelve batters in a row to end the game.|$|E

2500|$|For each turn {{a player}} throws 3 cheeses at the {{skittles}} which start {{standing in the}} classic diamond pattern. [...] If all the skittles are toppled after the first or <b>second</b> <b>throws,</b> they are reset and the player throws his remaining cheeses at the newly set skittles, adding his scores together. A player might knock down all nine skittles with the first throw {{and do the same}} on the <b>second</b> <b>throw,</b> offering the possibility of the skittles being set up a third time for the final cheese and a maximum theoretical score of 27 points.|$|R

5000|$|Thirteen athletes {{made the}} {{automatic}} qualifying mark {{to get into}} the final. Five throws into the first round, Johannes Vetter (GER) threw the winner, [...] At the end of the round, his teammate Thomas Röhler threw 87.08 m to move into second place. On the <b>second</b> <b>throw</b> of the <b>second</b> round, Jakub Vadlejch (CZE) threw tantalizingly close to Vetter with an 89.73 m. Three <b>throws</b> later, Vetter's <b>second</b> <b>throw</b> even bettered that, 89.78 m. At the end of round, Röhler improved to 88.26 m Through the next three rounds, nobody could surpass that third best throw, not even the leaders, though Petr Frydrych (CZE) threw 87.93 m twice. On his final throw, Frydrych threw 88.32m to take the bronze medal. Both Czech athletes are coached by world record holder Jan Železný. Both threw personal bests.|$|R
50|$|To get {{the maximum}} average score the {{strategy}} is straightforward. After the first throw the player will keep any 5s and 6s. After the <b>second</b> <b>throw</b> he will keep any 4s, 5s, and 6s. On average he will score 23.33. Different strategies will be required when he needs to achieve a specific target.|$|R
