25|$|There are two {{proposed}} theoretical views generally {{taken to}} approach bilingual aphasia.

The Dynamic view offers an explanation for <b>selective</b> <b>recovery</b> of language and many reported recovery patterns in bilingual aphasia (See Recovery) There is much debate over which hemisphere supports the languages and which intrahemispheric neural regions represent each language within a bilingual individual. Most neuroimaging studies show no laterality differences between monolingual and bilingual speakers, supporting the hypothesis that languages share some areas of the brain, but also have some separate neural areas.

40|$|The {{difficulties}} for <b>selective</b> metal <b>recovery</b> from electronic waste are {{induced by the}} high complexity of such waste stream and complicated purification procedures. In this research, an electrochemical stimulated method is demonstrated to selective recover copper from an industrially provided electronic waste. More specific, one-step <b>selective</b> copper <b>recovery</b> was achieved by combining electrochemical dissolution and deposition in ammonia-based electrolyte. In the process, copper instead of other impure metals from the electronic waste is selectively dissolved and electrochemically enhanced at the anode. On {{the other side of}} the cell, pure copper was electrodeposited at the cathode. The current efficiency was found to be significantly influenced by the applied current density if galvanostatic process was facilitated. Both temperature and copper concentration in the electrolyte were found to have positive effects on the current efficiency. In a well-controlled process, copper of 99. 56 wt% purity can be obtained which can be further improved by preventing potential oxidation on the electrodeposited layer. This research provide a possibility for <b>selective</b> copper <b>recovery</b> in one-step by substantially decreasing the purification cost and simplifying copper recovery procedures from electronic waste.

Leaching in 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution at 90 C with a 15 % solids concentration during 120 min of a crushed mixture of flowers and seeds of A. murale can produce leachate concentrated in Ni.

40|$|An {{environmental}} benign, non-acid {{process was}} successfully developed for <b>selective</b> <b>recovery</b> of palladium from waste {{printed circuit boards}} (PCBs). In the process, palladium was firstly enriched during copper recovery procedure and dissolved in a special solution made of CuSO 4 and NaCl. The dissolved palladium was then extracted by diisoamyl sulfide (S 201). It was found that 99. 4 % of Pd(II) could be extracted from the solution under the optimum conditions (10 % S 201, A/O ratio 5 and 2 min extraction). In the whole extraction process, the influence of base metals was negligible due to the relatively weak nucleophilic substitution of S 201 with base metal irons and the strong steric hindrance of S 201 molecular. Around 99. 5 % of the extracted Pd(II) could be stripped from S 201 /dodecane with 0. 1 mol/L NH 3 after a two-stage stripping at A/O ratio of 1. The total recovery percentage of palladium was 96. 9 % during the dissolution-extraction-stripping process.
