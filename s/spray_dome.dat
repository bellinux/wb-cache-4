50|$|The test {{conditions}} were met on May 16 {{allowing for the}} nuclear device to be detonated. Within a second of detonation, a <b>spray</b> <b>dome</b> was created that reached a height of 840 feet after seven seconds. The overall shape of the <b>spray</b> <b>dome</b> resembled an inverted cone with 45 degree sloped sides. Plumes were seen breaking through the <b>spray</b> <b>dome</b> after six seconds in every direction. The vertical plume continued rising until 12 seconds after the blast while the lateral plumes traveled for 20 seconds before collapsing. The diameter of the <b>spray</b> <b>dome</b> was approximately 3,800 feet at the 20 second mark. The base surge reached a radius of 8,000 feet in the downwind direction after 1.7 seconds. The downwind surge aided by a 15 knot wind reached speeds of 21 knots (24.2 mph). This base surge could be seen {{for three and a}} half minutes and for longer from the air as it continued to move across the ocean. When the <b>spray</b> <b>dome</b> and base surge had dissipated, a foam patch could be seen spreading from the surface zero water to reach over 6,000 feet. The nuclear device had a blast that was calculated to be nine kilotons. All fallout stayed within the predicted fallout area with a maximum of 0.030 R/hr. The target ship at 5,900 yards was directly hit by the shockwave vibrating the entire ship and shaking it violently. The Moran, merchant marine ship moored at 2,346 feet away, was immobilized due to shock damage to its main and auxiliary equipment while also attaining minor hull damage. One hour and ten minutes after detonation, a five-gallon water sample was taken directly above the blast location showing a 5 R/hr. The retrieval team entered a 3.8 R/hr field after an hour and thirty five minutes.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a deep {{underwater}} explosion is the Wahoo test, which {{was carried out in}} 1958 as part of Operation Hardtack I. A 9 kt Mk-7 was detonated at a depth of 500 ft in deep water. There was little evidence of a fireball. The <b>spray</b> <b>dome</b> rose to a height of 900 ft. Gas from the bubble broke through the <b>spray</b> <b>dome</b> to form jets which shot out in all directions and reached heights of up to 1700 ft. The base surge at its maximum size was 2.5 mi in diameter and 1000 ft high.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the CONTAIN code to predict the thermal {{hydraulics}} of five experiments performed in the NUPEC 1 / 4 -scale model containment was assessed. These experiments simulated severe accident conditions in {{a nuclear power plant}} in which helium (as a nonflammable substitute for hydrogen) and steam were coinjected at different locations in the facility with and without the concurrent injection of water <b>sprays</b> in the <b>dome.</b> Helium concentrations, gas temperatures and pressures, and wall temperatures were predicted and compared with the data. The use of different flow solvers, nodalization schemes, and analysis methods for the treatment of water sprays was emphasized. As a result, a general procedure was suggested for lumped-parameter code analyses of problems in which the thermal hydraulics are dominated by water sprays...|$|R
40|$|From November 2004 to December 2007, size-segregated aerosol {{samples were}} {{collected}} all-year-round at Dome C (East Antarctica) by using PM 10 and PM 2. 5 samplers, and multi-stage impactors. The data set obtained from the chemical analysis provided the longest and the most time-resolved record of sea spray aerosol (sea salt Na+) in inner Antarctica. Sea spray showed a sharp seasonal pattern. The highest values measured in winter (Apr-Nov) were about ten times larger than in summer (Dec-Mar). For the first time, a size-distribution seasonal pattern was also shown: in winter, sea spray particles are mainly submicrometric, while their summer size-mode is around 1 - 2 Âµm. Meteorological analysis on a synoptic scale allowed the definition of atmospheric conditions leading sea <b>spray</b> to <b>Dome</b> C. An extreme-value approach along with specific environmental based criteria was taken to yield stronger fingerprints linking atmospheric circulation (means and anomalies) to extreme sea spray events. Air mass back-trajectory analyses for some high sea spray events allowed the identification of two major air mass pathways, reflecting different size distributions: micrometric fractions for transport from the closer Indian-Pacific sector, and sub-micrometric particles for longer trajectories over the Antarctic Plateau. The seasonal pattern of the SO 4 ** 2 - /Na+ ratio enabled the identification of few events depleted in sulphate, {{with respect to the}} seawater composition. By using methanesulphonic acid (MSA) profile to evaluate the biogenic SO 4 ** 2 - contribution, a more reliable sea salt sulphate was calculated. In this way, few events (mainly in April and in September) were identified originating probably from the "frost flower" source. A comparison with daily-collected superficial snow samples revealed that there is a temporal shift between aerosol and snow sea spray trends. This feature could imply a more complex deposition processes of sea spray, involving significant contribution of wet and diamond dust deposition, but further work has to be carried out to rule out the effect of wind re-distribution and to have more statistic significance...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the first}} full second, the {{expanding}} bubble removed all the water within a 500 ft radius and lifted two million tons of spray and seabed sand into the air. As the bubble rose at 2500 ft/s, it stretched the <b>spray</b> <b>dome</b> into a hollow cylinder or chimney of spray called the [...] "column", 6000 ft tall and 2000 ft wide, with walls 300 ft thick.|$|E
50|$|The 9th of June {{held the}} second {{underwater}} nuclear {{test of the}} Hardtack I series. The detonation occurred at 1115 with clear skies and a 15 to 17 knot wind from the east-northeast. Within one-tenth of a second, the <b>spray</b> <b>dome</b> had broken through the surface. The overall shape of the <b>spray</b> <b>dome</b> resembled a vertical column with the plumes helping create the shape. Within 20 seconds detonation, the maximum height of the column reached 5,000 feet. The base surge reached a distance around 10,000 feet downwind and reaching out approximately 6,000 feet in all directions. This base surge could {{be seen from the}} air for about 25 minutes and the foam patch over the blast location lasting even longer. The blast yield of the nuclear device was measured to be eight kilotons. The Umbrella blast created a crater 3,000 feet in diameter and 20 feet in depth in the lagoon. The maximum radiation reading was found to be 0.350 R/hr by an aircraft flying over the blast location. Radiation was reported to be of small portions, and reentry was granted 30 minutes after detonation. Out of the major target ships, the highest radiation reading was logged at 0.0015 R/hr of the stern of the Moran. After all scientific data had been gathered from the target ships, they were restored to be seaworthy and towed back to Pearl Harbor. The Moran was concluded to be unseaworthy due to the blast and was sunk by naval gunfire near Ikuren Island.|$|E
50|$|The Baker {{nuclear test}} at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 was a shallow {{underwater}} explosion, part of Operation Crossroads. A 20 kiloton warhead was detonated in a lagoon which was approximately 200 ft deep. The first effect was illumination {{of the water}} because of the underwater fireball. A rapidly expanding gas bubble created a shock wave that caused an expanding ring of apparently dark water at the surface, called the slick, followed by an expanding ring of apparently white water, called the crack. A mound of water and spray, called the <b>spray</b> <b>dome,</b> formed at the water's surface which became more columnar as it rose. When the rising gas bubble broke the surface, it created a shock wave {{in the air as}} well. Water vapor in the air condensed {{as a result of a}} Prandtl-Glauert singularity, making a spherical cloud that marked the location of the shock wave. Water filling the cavity formed by the bubble caused a hollow column of water, called the chimney or plume, to rise 6000 ft in the air and break through the top of the cloud. A series of surface waves moved outwards from the center. The first wave was about 94 ft high at 1000 ft from the center. Other waves followed, and at further distances some of these were higher than the first wave. For example, at 22000 ft from the center, the ninth wave was the highest at 6 ft. Gravity caused the column to fall to the surface and caused a cloud of mist to move outwards rapidly from the base of the column, called the base surge. The ultimate size of the base surge was 3.5 mi in diameter and 1800 ft high. The base surge rose from the surface and merged with other products of the explosion, to form clouds which produced moderate to heavy rainfall for nearly one hour.|$|E
