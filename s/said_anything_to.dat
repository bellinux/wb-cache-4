25|$|This {{new number}} {{was based on}} {{information}} obtained from two imprisoned Kiowa chiefs at Fort Cobb who faced death by hanging. In view of their predicament, {{it seems likely that}} these men would have <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> avoid the gallows. But such skepticism is not warranted {{in the case of the}} Washita prisoners. The Cheyenne women were allowed to mingle freely with the officers and knew many of them on an intimate basis. They were assured good treatment and had no apparent reason to distort their statements about dead kinsmen.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Genie's {{stay the}} {{scientists}} saw how frequently and effectively {{she used her}} nonverbal skills, and never determined what she did to elicit such strong reactions from other people. David Rigler vividly remembered an occasion when he and Genie passed {{a father and a}} young boy carrying a toy firetruck without speaking to each other, and said the boy suddenly turned around and gave the firetruck to Genie. Curtiss also recalled one time when, while she and Genie were walking and had stopped at a busy intersection, she unexpectedly heard a purse emptying; she turned to see a woman stop at the intersection and exit her car to give Genie a plastic purse, even though Genie had not <b>said</b> <b>anything.</b> <b>To</b> take full advantage of her nonverbal communication abilities, in 1974 the Riglers arranged for her to learn a form of sign language.|$|E
500|$|Eaton: [...] "Have {{you ever}} seen {{anything}} {{in the conduct of}} General Babcock, or has he ever <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> you, which indicated to your mind that he was in any way interested in or concerned with the Whiskey Ring at St. Louis or elsewhere?" ...|$|E

I was caught out {{like a lot of}} artists were, with record companies figuring out how to do single releases these days. I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles and it just felt really old-fashioned. I'm pretty computer-savvy, something didn't feel right, but no one <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> me. You get Britney releasing [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] available on iTunes the day you hear it first. That's how it should be. And there's me waiting for a mid-week chart figure like it's 1989." ...|$|E
500|$|Dudley {{negotiated}} a separate {{peace with the}} Abenakis at Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1713. [...] He hoped to separate the western Kennebec tribe from French influence and consequently adopted a fairly hard line, threatening to withhold trade that was vital to their survival and reiterating claims of British sovereignty over the Abenaki. [...] The Treaty of Portsmouth resulted from those negotiations and repeats the claims of sovereignty. Dudley claimed that the French had ceded Abenaki lands as part of Acadia, and one sachem responded: [...] "The French never <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> us about it, and we wonder how they would give it away without asking us". [...] Nevertheless, Dudley and succeeding governors treated the Abenaki as British subjects, and friction persisted over British colonial expansion into Maine which flared into Dummer's War in the 1720s.|$|E
500|$|Christian Scientists {{call this}} [...] "the fall in Lynn," [...] {{and see it}} as the birth of their religion. Decades later Eddy wrote that, on the third day after the fall, she had been helped by reading a certain Bible passage. In several editions of Science and Health she {{identified}} it as Mark 3, but later said that it had been Matthew 9:2–8, a passage about Jesus healing the paralytic at Capernaum: [...] "As I read, the healing Truth dawned upon my sense; and the result was that I rose, dressed myself, and ever after was in better health than I had before enjoyed." [...] The physician who treated her at the time, Alvin M. Cushing, swore in an affidavit in 1907 that the injury had not been a serious one, and that Eddy had responded to morphine and a homeopathic remedy; she had not <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> him about a miraculous healing.|$|E

500|$|While {{majoring in}} finance, Youkilis excelled {{as a player}} for the Cincinnati Bearcats from 1998 to 2001. [...] "I take no credit", said Cleary. [...] "He coaches himself. He knows his swing. Any time we <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> him, he was already a step ahead. He made the {{adjustments}} he had to make. I just think he's a really smart guy who had a great feel {{for what he had}} to do." [...] In his junior year in 2000, he was a second-team All-American and first-team All-Conference USA, as he set school records by hitting three home runs in one game and 19 for the season; still, he went undrafted. [...] "He was kind of a square-shaped body, a guy [...] in a uniform didn't look all that athletic", Cleary said. [...] "He wasn't a tall, prospect-y looking guy. He looked chubby in a uniform. ... It wasn't fat. He was strong. [...] I think the body did scare some people away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cousins {{notes of}} Bower that 'a very {{clear sense of}} his rigid code of honour is plain, and a {{conviction}} that not only unity, peace and happiness in South Africa, but also the peace of Europe would be endangered if he told the truth. He believed that, as he had given Rhodes his word not to divulge certain private conversations, he had to abide by that, {{while at the same}} time he was convinced that it would be very damaging to Britain if he <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> the parliamentary committee to show the close involvement of Sir Hercules Robinson and Joseph Chamberlain in their disreputable encouragement of those plotting an uprising in Johannesburg.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke, {{who does}} not appear on the {{recording}}, noted that the recording foreshadowed his departure from the band, stating: [...] "They did that while I {{was on the road}} touring for my solo record. [...] I knew that that was the ending because nobody told me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me. That {{was one of the last}} straws for me, because nobody had <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> me, and they recorded a song by one of my favorite bands. It was pretty clear I'm a big Rolling Stones fan, and they recorded the song without me. So I knew that was it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Both, I think! I seem to {{have thought}} of {{thousands}} of things, and yet my whole soul was one scream of despairing prayer, though I don't believe I <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> except <b>to</b> bid the boy hold still, till I heard that welcome shout." ...|$|R

2500|$|Wray never <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> {{suggest that}} she knew why she had been called into this meeting, other than that it had {{something}} to do with Paulette Goddard, who was lined up to play Lucrezia Borgia, and that there was some connection to Dalton Trumbo's troubles. Dalton Trumbo's troubles were that The Hollywood Reporter had publicly named him and a dozen or so other industry professionals as communist sympathizers, and that the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) had seized upon this list as the starting point for their investigation into communist influence in Hollywood. [...] Paulette Goddard was a rising star at Paramount and the studio was heavily invested in her, but she was also at risk of being swept into the HUAC's investigation by virtue of her marriage to actor Burgess Meredith, whose communist affiliations were a matter of record.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{invasion}} {{took place}} between December 1299 and April 1300 due to the military campaign by the Mamluks against the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia who were allied with the Mongols. The Ilkhanate army managed to reach Damascus {{by the end of}} December 1299. Ibn Taymiyyah went with a delegation of Islamic scholars to talk to Ghazan Khan, who was the Khan of the Mongol Ilkhanate of Iran, to plead clemency and to stop his attack on the Muslims. It is reported that none of the scholars <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> the Khan except Ibn Taymiyyah who said: [...] "You claim that you are Muslim and you have with you Mu'adhdhins, Muftis, Imams and Shaykhs but you invaded us and reached our country for what? While your father and your grandfather, Hulagu were non-believers, they did not attack and they kept their promise. But you promised and broke your promise." [...] By early January 1300 the Mongol allies, the Armenians and Georgians, had caused widespread damage to Damascus and they had taken Syrian prisoners. The Mongols effectively occupied Damascus for the first four months of 1303. Most of the military had fled the city, including most of the civilians. Ibn Taymiyyah however, stayed {{and was one of the}} leaders of the resistance inside Damascus and he went to speak directily to the Mongol Ilkhan Mahmud Ghazan and his vizier Rashid al-Din Tabib. He sought the release of Muslim and dhimmi prisoners which the Mongols had taken in Syria, and after discussion, secured their release.|$|E
2500|$|... “There were a {{great many}} cowboys with the show. [...] There was a chief of the cowboys who had general {{supervision}} over both horses and men. [...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
