To this end, the following questions seem paramount: 1. How does one predict that a capability is about to emerge or <b>self</b> <b>organize?</b> 2. How does one know or assess if a newly <b>self</b> <b>organized</b> or emergent capability will be better or worse than the capabilities currently available in a process? 3. What types of knowledge are required to enable agents {{to be able to}} exhibit emergent capabilities or <b>self</b> <b>organizing</b> capabilities? The primary conclusions of this research are: 1. That we should develop a rigorous assessment process, capable of predicting and evaluating both emergent and <b>self</b> <b>organizing</b> capabilities. 2. That much more theoretical work and development is necessary to produce emergent and <b>self</b> <b>organizing</b> capabilities which can be relied upon in a military context. 3.
