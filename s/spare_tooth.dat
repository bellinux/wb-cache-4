40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{in vitro}} the fracture resistance {{of two different}} post systems, a conventional one with post space preparation using a drill and an alternative one adapted to the canal shape. Methodology: After sample size calculation, the crowns of 26 single-rooted freshly-extracted teeth were removed with a disc 1 mm coronal to the cemento-enamel junction. The canals were shaped with Mtwo rotary files up to size 40, 0. 06 tpaer and filled with the continuous wave of condensation technique leaving the coronal 9 mm of the canal unfilled. After the post space preparation by a dedicated drill, double-tapered fibre posts (DT Light-Post) were cemented in half of the roots (G 1, n = 13). 0. 06 tapered fibre posts (Tech S Endoshape) were trimmed to fit the canal of the remaining roots (G 2, n = 13) and then cemented without post space preparation. A self- adhesive cement (RelyX Unicem) was used in both groups. The posts were cut 5 mm from the root coronal surface. The specimens were embedded in acrylic resin {{and the top of}} the post was loaded under continuous compressive force (45 °, 0. 75 mm/min) to measure the maximum breaking load (N). Data were statistically analyzed by using a Student’s t-test (α = 0. 05). Results: The mean maximum breaking loads ±SD were G 1 = 164. 07 ± 21. 54 and G 2 = 151. 22 ± 14. 69. The difference was not statistically significant (P = 0. 093). Only post fractures were detected, with all the roots remaining intact. Conclusions: Within the limitation of the study, conservative posts without post space preparation performed similarly to conventional ones. In order to avoid procedural errors during the post space preparation and to <b>spare</b> <b>tooth</b> structure a conservative approach seems advisable...|$|E
40|$|The {{buccal cavity}} of Parahadronchus shakil i is formed anew {{during the process}} of moulting. A total of four moults occur. In the late phase of each moult there are always three dorsal teeth, one of these is cast off along with the old buccal cavity, the second one becomes the {{functional}} tooth of the stage to follow, while the third one is the <b>spare</b> <b>tooth</b> of the future stage. The development of the buccal cavity i,s more pronounced in the adults than in the juv-eniles. The development of oesophagus and tail in relation to total body length is greater in juveniles than adults. The genital primordium in the first stage juveniles consists of two oval bodies connected by a cellularstrand. Each oval body has one germinal nucleus and two somatic nuclei. The cap ce 11 nuclei are derived from the division of the somatic nuclei at the distal and proximal ends of the primordium and o not divide again. The germinal nuclei divide {{for the first time in}} the third moult while the somatic nuclei do so in the second moult. The somatic nuclei proliferate in the middle region of eaoh primordium to form the gonoduct. The epidermal nuclei are derived from the somatic nuclei a t the opposite ends of the primordia and €ormi the epidermal walls of the testes and ovaries. The vagina is formed by the specialized ventral chord nuclei, whereas the development of spicules and gubernaculum takes place from the spicular primordium in the anal region which is distinguishable in the third stage male juveniles. Sex differentiation occurs in the second stage juveniles when specialized ventral chord nuclei make their appearence in the female juveniles. The deyelopment of the genital tract and ovary in various seasons also differed. The frequency of egg production by the anterior ovary was much grgater than that by the posterior ovary (2 : 1).

40|$|Space maintainers {{make good}} oral hygiene difficult, modify the oral environment, and {{increase}} the chances of enamel demineralization. Demineralization can be prevented or reduced by improving patient oral hygiene or by using topical fluorides. However these methods depend on patient compliance and, therefore, are not very reliable. Thus, caries prevention in banding might be enhanced by using fluoride-releasing cements. The aim {{of the study was}} to comparatively evaluate the carioprotective potential of various luting media used for band cementation in permanent as well as deciduous molars. In this study, 100 molars were taken, which were banded and stored in artificial saliva for 1 month after which the teeth were debanded. An area of 2 x 2 mm was <b>spared</b> and the <b>teeth</b> were coated with nail varnish. The coated teeth were dipped in artificial caries solution in one month followed by 1 -day immersion in methylene blue dye, after which the samples were sectioned through the window. The depth of dye penetration was measured and the results were statistically analyzed. Minimum dye penetration was observed with glass ionomer, which could be due to the fluoride release from the cement, whereas the control group showed the maximum, probably due to direct contact with the artificial caries solution...|$|R
40|$|Changes {{occur to}} the {{mandible}} with dental loss and senescence. However, {{the influence that}} these changes have on sex and ancestry estimations remains unclear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the influence of dental loss and senescence on changes in mandibular morphology. The outcome has implications for both forensic anthropology and restorative dentistry. The study sample consisted of 717 mandibles consisting of both male and female South Africans of African (SAA) and European ancestry (SAE). To minimise the effects of variation in dentition amongst sex-ancestry groups, the sample included individuals with a spectrum of tooth loss patterns, namely efficient and inefficient occlusions as well as no occlusions. Dentition was considered efficient when the remaining teeth in occlusion were evenly distributed between the sides. Linear measurements as well as geometric morphometric shape analyses were performed. Shape analyses of the complete mandible were performed on models from digitised landmarks by using a MicroScribe G 2. Detailed shape analyses of the ramus and chin area as well as measurements of the cortical thickness at specific sites were executed on images generated by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). A comprehensive assessment of changes in shape, size and cortical thickness of the mandible with age and dental loss were made. Shape and size differences of the mandible were evaluated for discriminant abilities between sex and ancestry groups. Although most dimensions decreased with tooth loss, the greatest impact was noted in the loss of alveolar bone. The mandibular angle increased minimally in size when a few teeth were lost, but recovered to some extent with further tooth loss. The cortical thicknesses at the mental foramen lingually as well as in the midline in females, were relatively <b>spared</b> with <b>tooth</b> loss. Male individuals of SAA were often the most resilient to tooth loss. In general external linear dimensions were maintained with age despite tooth loss. Conversely, measurements of cortical bone thickness decreased slightly, but could have been influenced by dental loss. The shape of the chin and gonial area was more affected by aging in SAE. The sex and ancestry discriminant ability of the linear dimensions when considered collectively approximated 90 %, in general improving further when tooth loss was taken into account. All linear measurements were smaller in females and in general tooth loss accentuated sex differences. SAA exhibited greater dimensions, apart from maximum ramus height, bigonial breadth and cortical thickness at the gonion. The mental tubercles were more prominent than the pogonion in SAE (square chin) and vice versa in individuals of SAA (pointed chin). The gonial area in individuals of African ancestry was broad and more convex and the gonial eversion more prominent with a more upright ramus. Discriminant qualities of the gonial shape for sex in individuals of African ancestry reached 90 % within dentition groups. Ramus flexure and chin shape were not found to be useful in sex estimation. In conclusion, this research elucidated the effects of tooth loss and senescence on the morphology of the mandible for the forensic anthropological setting.
