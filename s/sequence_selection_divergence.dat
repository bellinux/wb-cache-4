These results answer problems posed by M. Scheepers.

40|$|A new (to our knowledge) de novo design {{framework}} with {{a ranking}} metric based on approximate binding affinity calculations is introduced {{and applied to}} the discovery of what we believe are novel HIV- 1 entry inhibitors. The framework consists of two stages: a <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> stage and a validation stage. The <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> stage produces a rank-ordered list of amino-acid sequences by solving an integer programming <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> model. The validation stage consists of fold specificity and approximate binding affinity calculations. The designed peptidic inhibitors are 12 -amino-acids-long and target the hydrophobic core of gp 41. A number of the best-predicted sequences were synthesized and their inhibition of HIV- 1 was tested in cell culture. All peptides examined showed inhibitory activity when compared with no drug present, and the novel peptide sequences outperformed the native template sequence used for the design. The best sequence showed micromolar inhibition, which is a 3 – 15 -fold improvement over the native sequence, depending on the donor. In addition, the best sequence equally inhibited wild-type and Enfuvirtide-resistant virus strains...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{capacity}} of visually oriented species to perceive {{and respond to}} visual signal is integral to their evolutionary success. Giraffes {{are closely related to}} okapi, but the two species have broad range of phenotypic differences including their visual capacities. Vision studies rank giraffe’s visual acuity higher than all other artiodactyls despite sharing similar vision ecological determinants with many of them. The extent to which the giraffe’s unique visual capacity and its difference with okapi is reflected by changes in their vision genes is not understood. Methods The recent availability of giraffe and okapi genomes provided opportunity to identify giraffe and okapi vision genes. Multiple strategies were employed to identify thirty-six candidate mammalian vision genes in giraffe and okapi genomes. Quantification of selection pressure was performed by a combination of branch-site tests of positive selection and clade models of <b>selection</b> <b>divergence</b> through comparing giraffe and okapi vision genes and orthologous sequences from other mammals. Results Signatures of selection were identified in key genes that could potentially underlie giraffe and okapi visual adaptations. Importantly, some genes that contribute to optical transparency of the eye and those that are critical in light signaling pathway were found to show signatures of adaptive evolution or <b>selection</b> <b>divergence.</b> Comparison between giraffe and other ruminants identifies significant <b>selection</b> <b>divergence</b> in CRYAA and OPN 1 LW. Significant selection divergence was identified in SAG while positive selection was detected in LUM when okapi is compared with ruminants and other mammals. Sequence analysis of OPN 1 LW showed {{that at least one of}} the sites known to affect spectral sensitivity of the red pigment is uniquely divergent between giraffe and other ruminants. Discussion By taking a systemic approach to gene function in vision, the results provide the first molecular clues associated with giraffe and okapi vision adaptations. At least some of the genes that exhibit signature of selection may reflect adaptive response to differences in giraffe and okapi habitat. We hypothesize that requirement for long distance vision associated with predation and communication with conspecifics likely played an important role in the adaptive pressure on giraffe vision genes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTwo de novo {{protein design}} {{frameworks}} {{are applied to}} the discovery of new compstatin variants.

The proposed frameworks were applied to a complex of C 3 c with compstatin variant E 1 and new variants with improved binding affinities are predicted and experimentally validated. The computational studies elucidated key positions in the sequence of compstatin that greatly affect the binding affinity. Positions 4 and 13 were found to favor Trp, whereas positions 1, 9, and 10 are dominated by Asn, and position 11 consists mainly of Gln.

40|$|Motivation: Various {{multiple}} sequence alignment-based {{methods have}} been proposed to detect functional surfaces in proteins, such as active sites or protein interfaces. The effect that the choice of sequences has on the conclusions of such analysis has seldom been discussed. In particular, no method has been {{discussed in terms of}} its ability to optimize the <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> for the reliable detection of functional surfaces. Results: Here we propose, for the case of proteins with known struc-ture, a heuristic Metropolis Monte Carlo strategy to select sequences from a large set of homologues, in order to improve detection of func-tional surfaces. The quantity guiding the optimization is the clustering of residueswhichareunder increasedevolutionarypressure, according to the sample of sequences under consideration. We show that we can either improve the overlap of our prediction with known functional sur-faces in comparison with the sequence similarity criteria of selection or match the quality of prediction obtained through more elaborate non-structure based-methods of <b>sequence</b> <b>selection.</b> For the purpose of demonstration we use a set of 50 homodimerizing enzymes which were co-crystallized with their substrates and cofactors.

40|$|Backgound: Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of the cubic lattice protein model with engineered sequences were performed {{in order to}} address the issue of potential accuracy required for folding. The potential used for <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> played the role of the ‘real’ potential and different levels of inaccuracy were introduced by addition of noise. ResultsThe dependence of successful folding probability on potential noise was found to be sigmoidal and sequence-specific and can be described by an expression analytically derived from a simple theoretical model in which the density of states of the system contains a continuous region approximated by a Gaussian distribution separated from the unique native conformation by a large energy gap. ConclusionThe decrease in folding probability with potential inaccuracy results from an average decrease in the energy gap. Sequences with large energy gaps support larger inaccuracies while retaining the ability to fold properly. As the energy gap is known to correlate with thermal stability, we suggest a simple criterion for specific real <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> in order to maximize success probability in realistic folding simulations...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{computing}} optimal routes poses new challenges when extending it to larger multi-domain network scenarios, as {{the quality of}} these computed endto-end inter-domain routes depends on {{the selection of the}} domain sequence to be traversed. In the scope of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Path Computation Element (PCE) Working Group has not provided definitive solutions to address the domain <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> problem, being still a work in progress. To this goal, the Path Computation Flooding (PCF) approach appears as a possible extension to Backward Recursive PCE-based Computation (BRPC) to calculate optimal end-to-end inter-domain paths without requiring a pre-configured domain sequence. Nonetheless, PCF presents major scalability issues in terms of network control overhead and path computation complexity, thus pleading for more accurate domain <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> techniques. This paper describes two novel mechanisms to establish inter-domain paths calculating the sequence of domains to be crossed when it is not known in advance. Both procedures make a good trade-off between the control overhead introduced and the accuracy of the computed end-to-end route. The obtained simulation results show the benefits of the proposed contributions, drastically reducing the control overhead while keeping the connection blocking probability close to the optimal values.
