5000|$|Amdahl's law {{is often}} conflated {{with the law}} of {{diminishing}} returns, whereas only a special case of applying Amdahl's law demonstrates law of diminishing returns. If one picks optimally (in terms of the achieved speedup) what to improve, then one will see monotonically decreasing improvements as one improves. If, however, one picks non-optimally, after improving a sub-optimal component and moving on to improve a more optimal component, one can see {{an increase in the}} return. Note that it is often rational to improve a system in an order that is [...] "non-optimal" [...] in this sense, given that <b>some</b> <b>improvements</b> <b>are</b> more difficult or require larger development time than others.|$|E

It will involve about 5.6 million train-kilometres a year, at a cost of €9-10 per train-km, a total cost of about €50 to 55 million. Because the operation of the network is to be contracted for a period of 12 years, it will be worth more than €600 million.|$|E
