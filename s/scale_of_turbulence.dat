40|$|A {{technique}} is developed for estimating the outer <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>turbulence</b> in a planetary atmosphere using dual-frequency radio occultation measurements. This {{technique is}} based on the frequency dependence of the temporal frequency spectra for the log-amplitude fluctuations and is particularly useful when probing the upper atmosphere where the transverse velocity of the line-of-sight path is decelerating very rapidly. It is applied to the region of strong turbulence located in the vicinity of 60 km on the dayside of the atmosphere of Venus using the Mariner 10 S/X radio occultation measurements. It is found that, contrary to earlier findings from Mariner 5, the outer <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>turbulence</b> is at least 5 km.

In this paper, we present a technique for improving the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, in which we take into account the averaging effect arising from independent eddies along the line of sight. In the conventional Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, the strength of fluctuating magnetic field divided by √(4 πρ̅), where ρ̅ is average density, is assumed to be comparable to the line-of-sight velocity dispersion. This however is not true when the driving <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>turbulence</b> L_f, i. e. the outer <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>turbulence,</b> is smaller than the size of the system along the line of sight L_los.

We provide new constraints to those two parameters. We use the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) to image the diffuse continuum emission in the Fan region at (l,b) (137. 0,+ 7. 0) at 80 "x 70 " resolution in the range [146, 174] MHz. We detect multi-scale fluctuations in the Galactic synchrotron emission and compute their power spectrum. Applying theoretical estimates and derivations from the literature for the first time, we derive the outer <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>turbulence</b> and {{the ratio of}} random to ordered magnetic field from the characteristics of these fluctuations. We obtain the deepest image of the Fan region to date and find diffuse continuum emission within the primary beam. The power spectrum of the foreground synchrotron fluctuations displays a power law behaviour for scales between 100 and 8 arcmin with a slope of (- 1. 84 +/- 0. 19). We find an upper limit of about 20 pc for the outer scale of the magnetic interstellar turbulence toward the Fan region. We also find a variation of the ratio of random to ordered field as a function of Galactic coordinates, supporting different turbulent regimes. We use power spectra fluctuations from LOFAR as well as earlier GMRT and WSRT observations to constrain the outer <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>turbulence</b> of the Galactic synchrotron foreground, finding a range of plausible values of 10 - 20 pc.
