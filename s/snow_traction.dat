50|$|Tread lugs often feature slits—sipes—that {{improve the}} {{flexibility}} of the lug to deform as it traverses the footprint area. This reduces shear stress in the lug and reduces heat build up. Testing of identical siped and unsiped tires showed measurable improvements in <b>snow</b> <b>traction</b> and ice braking performance, however diminishing and extending braking distances on wet and dry pavement by a few feet on siped tires. Off-road tire enthusiasts have been siping tires for years for greater traction, as many manufacturers now offer already siped off-road-tires.|$|E
2500|$|The trail down Dalzell Gorge {{from the}} divide is {{regarded}} as the worst stretch of the trail. Steep and straight, it drops [...] in elevation in just , and there is little traction so the teams are hard to control. Mushers have to ride the brake most of the way down and use a <b>snow</b> hook for <b>traction.</b> In 1988, rookie Peryll Kyzer fell through an ice bridge into a creek and spent the night wet. The route then follows Tatina River, which is also hazardous: in 1986 Butcher's lead dogs fell through the ice but landed on a second layer of ice instead of falling into the river. In 1997, Ramey Smyth lost the end of his pinkie when it hit an overhanging branch while negotiating the gorge.|$|R
