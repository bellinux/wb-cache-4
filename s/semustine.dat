50|$|Lomustine (INN), {{abbreviated}} CCNU (original {{brand name}} (formerly available) is CeeNU, now marketed as Gleostine), is an alkylating nitrosourea compound used in chemotherapy. It {{is closely related}} to <b>semustine</b> and is in the same family as streptozotocin. It is a highly lipid-soluble drug and thus crosses the blood-brain barrier. This property makes it ideal for treating brain tumors, which is its primary use. Lomustine has a long time to nadir (the time when white blood cells reach their lowest number).|$|E

50|$|The use of {{chemotherapy}} to treat stomach cancer has no firmly established standard of care. Unfortunately, stomach cancer {{has not been}} particularly sensitive to these drugs, and chemotherapy, if used, has usually served to palliatively {{reduce the size of}} the tumor, relieve symptoms of the disease and increase survival time. Some drugs used in stomach cancer treatment have included: 5-FU (fluorouracil) or its analog capecitabine, BCNU (carmustine), methyl-CCNU (<b>semustine)</b> and doxorubicin (Adriamycin), as well as mitomycin C, and more recently cisplatin and taxotere, often using drugs in various combinations. The relative benefits of these different drugs, alone and in combination, are unclear. Clinical researchers are exploring the benefits of giving chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor, or as adjuvant therapy after surgery to destroy remaining cancer cells.|$|E
40|$|Chloroethyl nitrosoureas {{constitute}} an important family of cancer chemotherapeutic agents, {{used in the}} treatment of various types of cancer. They exert antitumor activity by inducing DNA interstrand cross-links. <b>Semustine,</b> a chloroethyl nitrosourea, is a 4 -methyl derivative of lomustine. There exist some interesting reports dealing with DNA-binding properties of chloroethyl nitrosoureas; however, underlying mechanism of cytotoxicity caused by <b>semustine</b> has not been precisely and completely delineated. The present work focuses on understanding semustine-DNA interaction to comprehend its anti-proliferative action at molecular level using various spectroscopic techniques. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy is used to determine the binding site of <b>semustine</b> on DNA. Conformational transition in DNA after <b>semustine</b> complexation is investigated using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Stability of semustine-DNA complexes is determined using absorption spectroscopy. Results of the present study demonstrate that <b>semustine</b> performs major-groove-directed DNA alkylation at guanine residues in an incubation-time-drug-concentration-dependent manner. CD spectral outcomes suggest partial transition of DNA from native B-conformation to C-form. Calculated binding constants (K-a) for <b>semustine</b> and lomustine interactions with DNA are 1. 53 x 10 (3) M(- 1) and 8. 12 x 10 (3) M(- 1), respectively. Moreover, molecular modeling simulation is performed to predict preferential binding orientation of <b>semustine</b> with DNA that corroborates well with spectral outcomes. Results based on comparative study of DNA-binding properties of <b>semustine</b> and lomustine, presented here, may establish a correlation between molecular structure and cytotoxicity of chloroethyl nitrosoureas that may be instrumental in the designing and synthesis of new nitrosourea therapeutics possessing better efficacy and fewer side effects. ...|$|E
40|$|We report surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) {{studies on}} free calf thymus DNA and its {{complexes}} with anti-tumor chloroethyl nitrosourea derivatives; <b>semustine</b> and nimustine. Since, first incident of SERS in 1974, it has rapidly established into an analytical tool, {{which can be}} used for the trace detection and characterization of analytes. Here, we depict yet another application of SERS in the field of drug-DNA interaction and thereby, its promising role in rational designing of new chemotherapeutic agents. Vibrational spectral analysis has been performed in an attempt to delineate the anti-cancer action mechanism of above mentioned nitrosourea derivatives. Strong SERS bands associated with the complexation of DNA with <b>semustine</b> and nimustine have been observed, which reveal binding of nitrosourea derivatives with heterocyclic nitrogenous base pair of DNA duplex. Formation of dG-dC interstrand cross-link in DNA double helices is also suggested by the SERS spectral outcomes of CENUs-DNA adduct.

The agents most commonly associated with chemotherapy-associated nephrotoxicity are methotrexate, <b>semustine,</b> streptozocin, mithramycin, and cisplatin. Certain chemotherapeutic agents have adverse effects on the kidneys and urothelium that can be visualized radiographically, including cystic change, interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis, urothelial changes, haemorrhagic cystitis, acute tubular necrosis, and infarction. This review focuses on imaging features identifying complications of chemotherapy in the kidneys and collecting system and provides didactic cases to alert referring clinicians.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{focuses on}} {{curative}} effects of teniposide combining with <b>semustine</b> on patients with neuroglioma and the {{influences on the}} expression of Twist and E-cadherin in tissue. Sixty-eight patients with neuroglioma taking operation in our hospital {{were divided into two}} groups randomly. Single radiotherapy was given to 34 patients in group A, and teniposide (VM- 26) and <b>semustine</b> (Me-CCUN) were added to radiotherapy for 34 patients in group B. Then, curative effects, survival rate, living quality and adverse reaction rate after operation were compared between two groups. Moreover, the difference in positive expression rate of Twist and E-cadherin before and after treatment between two groups was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Results: In group B, the effective rate of treatment was 88. 2 %, and the disease control rate was 70. 6 %, higher than 52. 9 % and 32. 4 % in group A with statistical significance (P 0. 05). In addition, the difference in positive expression rate of Twist and E-cadherin between group A and group B has no statistical significance before treatment (P> 0. 05). After treatment, however, the positive rate of Twist in group B is lower than that in group A, while the positive rate of E-cadherin is higher. Both differences have statistical significance (P< 0. 05). Chemotherapy of VM- 26 combining with Me-CCNU can inhibit Twist expression and improve the expression rate of E-cadherin to help improving the curative effects and living quality and increasing survival rate...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{investigated}} {{the mechanism of}} Chloroethylnitrosoureas (CENUs) leading to secondary tumors after therapy, three kinds of CENUs, namely, Nimustine (ACNU), Carmustine (BCNU) and <b>Semustine</b> (MeCCNU) were used to investigated drug-induced DNA interstrand crosslinks(ICLs). Method: The alkaline comet assay was adopted to compare DNA damages induced by CENUs under different concentrations. Results: With the increase of drug’s concentration, DNA migration exhibited a positive concentration-dependent relationship in all three drugs. ACNU was shown to cause significant crosslinking. The other two drugs also induced crosslinking, but this could not be analyzed at high concentrations due to the high cytotoxicity of the drugs which caused cells death...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{conviction}} that postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy represent an acceptable {{standard of care}} for patients with Dukes ’ B (stage II) and Dukes ’ C (stage III) carcinoma of the rectum evolved {{in the absence of}} data from clinical trials designed to determine whether the addi-tion of radiotherapy results in improved disease-free sur-vival and overall survival. This study was carried out to address this issue. An additional aim was to determine whether leucovorin (LV) -modulated 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) is superior to the combination of 5 -FU, <b>semustine,</b> and vincristine (MOF) in men.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} {{clinical}} manifestations, neuroimaging and pathological characteristics of primary {{central nervous system}} lymphoma (PCNSL) with a normal immunity, and to explore the methods of treatment and diagnosis. METHODS The clinical, laboratory, imaging data and pathological find-ings and therapeutic efficacy of 31 cases with pathologically proved PCNSL, during a period from July 1995 to June 2006, were analyzed retrospectively. The method of surgery, used in combination with chemotherapy and radio-therapy, was evaluated in 18 cases versus a simple surgical procedure used in 5. Among the total cases, a CHOP regimen was employed in 11 and Teni-poside (VM 26) plus <b>Semustine</b> (me-CCUN) was used in 7 cases. RESULTS PCNSL had a variety of clinical features, so that its misdiagno-sis rate was high. The main clinical findings of PCNSL included intracranial hypertension and (focal) neurologic impairment.

40|$|Glutathione S-transferases (GST) are a {{superfamily}} of detoxifying enzymes {{present in}} most life forms. They catalyse the conjugation of the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) {{to a wide}} variety of exogenous and endogenous compounds with electrophilic functional groups to form more soluble and non-toxic peptide derivatives. The over-expression of the human class Pi enzyme (hGSTP 1) in tumours has been associated with multi-drug resistance. The work presented in this thesis is focused on the four polymorphisms of the hGSTP 1 enzyme and their reactivity towards five anticancer nitrosourea drugs. 	 The coding sequences of hGSTP 1 -A, -C and -D enzymes were obtained from the hGSTP 1 -B cDNA through successive cloning into the pGEM-T and pET- 28 a vectors, and site directed mutagenesis. This was followed by protein over-expression and purification by nickel affinity chromatography and gel filtration. 	Activity and inhibition assays, wavelength scans, mass spectrometry, denitrosation and thermofluor shift assays were performed to investigate the relationship between the four isozymes and the anticancer drugs (carmustine, lomustine, <b>semustine,</b> streptozocin and ethylnitrosourea). The enzymes were assayed for activity with 1 -clhoro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and hGSTP 1 -A and -D were found to be more active towards this substrate than the other hGSTP 1 variants. These two variants share residue Ile 104 which could influence catalysis towards different substrates. The mass spectrometry and denitrosation assays have shown that these drugs do not constitute substrates for the hGSTP 1 enzymes. The inhibition assays suggested that the four drugs may be weak inhibitors of the hGSTP 1 variants. However, the thermal shift assays did not show increased protein stability in the presence of the drugs. 	The hGSTP 1 -D protein was successfully crystallised which allowed determination of the first crystallographic structure of this variant. This has allowed a detailed comparison of hGSTP 1 -D with other hGSTP 1 protein structures available. The side chains of both amino acid residues Ile 104 and Val 113 of hGSTP 1 -D appear to occupy positions in the same orientation as the side chains of equivalent residues of other hGSTP 1 enzymes. The use of the same crystallisation conditions for co-crystallisation studies with hGSTP 1 -D and glutathione or the nitrosourea drugs did not result in protein crystals but further optimisation should be carried out. 	Nonetheless, the findings of this project have helped to understand the relationship of the hGSTP 1 natural variant enzymes with the five nitrosourea anticancer drugs and to realise that drug resistance in tumours over-expressing this class of hGSTs is not due to the fast metabolism of these drugs but most probably to the role that these enzymes play in cell apoptosis and survival...|$|E
