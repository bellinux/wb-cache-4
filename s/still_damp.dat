5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Kimi Räikkönen was eliminated due to a failure in communication, which meant he did not have enough time left for another fast lap {{at the end of the}} session. With the track <b>still</b> <b>damp</b> when qualifying began, times improved with every passing lap, with the drivers being able to switch from intermediate to slick tyres at the end of the first session. While the two Manor drivers once again qualified at the end of the grid, Jenson Button was also eliminated in Q1, leaving him with time penalties in the race, not being able to take the full extent of his 25-place grid penalty.|$|E
5|$|Due to rain {{shortly before}} the start of the race, it {{commenced}} behind the safety car, with every car equipped with full wet tyres. The safety car came back into the pitlane at the end of lap five and racing began properly. While the top four drivers stayed out, several behind chose to make a pitstop for intermediate tyres. Just one lap later, Pascal Wehrlein became the first casualty of the <b>still</b> <b>damp</b> track, sliding off the track and getting stuck in the gravel, leading to a brief virtual safety car period. During this time, both Hamilton and Rosberg changed tyres. The biggest winner of the first few laps was Sergio Pérez, who had worked up his way from tenth on the grid to fourth, ahead of Ricciardo. Meanwhile, at the front, Hamilton had established a five-second advantage over Rosberg, who soon came under attack by Verstappen, who was running well on the intermediate tyres. Bottas came into a spin on lap 11, losing positions and dropping back to 13th place. On lap 16, Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to make the switch to slick tyres, while Verstappen moved ahead of Rosberg into second position.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, when the track was <b>still</b> <b>damp</b> in some sections, Vettel set the fastest {{time of the}} night, a lap of 1:46.660 on super-soft tyres; Webber finished with the second fastest lap. Button drove aggressively and battled Vettel for the fastest time throughout before he ended with the third quickest lap, half a second off Vettel's pace. Alonso, who was fourth fastest, ran wide at turn 17 while on a quick lap and slid down the access road at the next corner; he stalled while attempting to rejoin the track and abandoned his car requiring marshals to push his Ferrari away from the track. Hamilton was fifth, with Barrichello and Massa in sixth and seventh places. The two Mercedes drivers were eighth and tenth; with Nico Rosberg ahead of Schumacher, separated by Kubica. Sutil's Force India was launched into the air when he hit a kerb at the Singapore Sling chicane and his front-left suspension was broken upon landing requiring him to miss half the session, and Alguersuari's left-rear tyre made contact with a barrier but he avoided major damage to his car. Sutil was fined US$10,000 (£6,300) by the stewards because he attempted to drive back to the pit lane in his damaged car and did not stop at a safe position on the circuit.|$|E
25|$|The fire {{continued}} to burn on the tower's upper floors.

500|$|The race {{began at}} 3:00pm local time (GMT+2), with the track <b>still</b> <b>damp</b> {{following}} a wet morning warm-up. [...] Sébastien Bourdais's Peugeot 908 HDi FAP led the field into the Dunlop Chicane, which he overshot, handing {{the lead to}} the No. 2 Audi R10 TDI.

500|$|While {{the rain}} had stopped at the {{beginning}} of the second session, the track was <b>still</b> <b>damp</b> and all drivers initially ran on intermediate tyres. Daniil Kvyat eventually set the fastest time at 1:48.277, just 0.023 seconds ahead of Nico Rosberg, with Lewis Hamilton in third, half a second down on Kvyat. Sebastian Vettel set the fifth fastest time while driving the most timed laps of the session at nineteen. Sainz, fastest in first practice, heard [...] "strange noises" [...] from his power unit, but eventually finished seventh fastest. Felipe Massa was the only Williams driver to run, as Valtteri Bottas saved wet-weather-tyres. After more than half an hour, more rain fell and a number of drivers went out to get more running on the full-wet tyres. This included Fernando Alonso, who had been forced to wait forty minutes to start his running due to an unspecified issue with the power unit.|$|E

25|$|Although their damping {{had been}} reduced as much as possible, spark {{transmitters}} <b>still</b> produced <b>damped</b> waves which had a wide bandwidth, creating interference with other transmitters. Around 1920 they became obsolete, superseded by vacuum tube transmitters which generated continuous waves at a single frequency, which could also be modulated to carry sound. Tesla's resonant transformer continued {{to be used in}} vacuum tube transmitters and receivers, and is a key component in radio to this day.|$|R

Visiting her at Sissinghurst some years later, she [...] "thought the less of her" [...] for troubling to provide, evidently in a hurry, table napkins that were <b>still</b> <b>damp.</b> Like Clarissa herself, many of her acquaintances frequented the bookshop Heywood Hill, next to the hairdresser Trumper's in Mayfair's Curzon Street, which, during the war was managed by Nancy Mitford and became a regular meeting place: according to Mitford's sister, Diana, Lady Mosley, [...] "its ground floor room didn't just look like a private club, it very nearly was one".|$|E
2500|$|The Poetry Foundation's website characterizes Ryan's poems as follows: [...] "Like Emily Dickinson and Marianne Moore before her, Ryan {{delights in}} quirks of logic and {{language}} and teases poetry {{out of the}} most unlikely places. She regards the 'rehabilitation of clichés,' for instance, {{as part of the}} poet’s mission. Characterized by subtle, surprising rhymes and nimble rhythms, her compact poems are charged with sly wit and off-beat wisdom." [...] J. D. McClatchy included Ryan in his 2003 anthology of contemporary American poetry. He wrote in his introduction, [...] "Her poems are compact, exhilarating, strange affairs, like Satie miniatures or Cornell boxes. … There are poets who start with lived life, <b>still</b> <b>damp</b> with sorrow or uncertainty, and lead it towards ideas about life. And there are poets who begin with ideas and draw life in towards their speculations. Marianne Moore and May Swenson were this latter sort of artist; so is Kay Ryan." ...|$|E

Abney Hall {{is one of the few}} places in Stockport to feature such wetlands. There is also a small cafe called Abney Garden Teas in the Abney Centre in the centre of the park.|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the final accretion stage of terrestrial planets from Mars-mass protoplanets that formed through oligarchic growth in a disk comparable to the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), through N-body simulation including random torques exerted by disk turbulence due to Magneto-Rotational-Instability. For the torques, we used the semi-analytical formula developed by Laughlin et al. (2004). The damping of orbital eccentricities (in all runs) and type-I migration (in some runs) due to the tidal interactions with disk gas are also included. We found that the orbital eccentricities pumped up by the turbulent torques and associated random walks in semimajor axes tend to delay isolation of planets, resulting in more coagulation of planets than in the case without turbulence. The eccentricities are <b>still</b> <b>damped</b> after planets become isolated. As a result, the number of final planets decreases with increase in strength of the turbulence, while Earth-mass planets with small eccentricities are still formed. In the case of relatively strong turbulence, the number of final planets are 4 - 5 at 0. 5 - 2 AU, {{which is consistent with}} Solar system, for relatively wide range of disk surface density (~ 10 ^{- 4 }- 10 ^{- 2 } times MMSN) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study by}} a fully nonlinear, {{three-dimensional}} pseudospectral, time-splitting simu-lation the feedback {{control of a}} layer of fluid heated from below. The initial condition corresponds to a steady, large-amplitude, preferred convection state obtained at Prandtl number of 7. 0 and Rayleigh number of 104, which is about six times the Rayleigh criti-cal value. A robust controller based on the LQG (Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian) synthesis method is used. Both sensors and actuator are thermal-based, planar, and assumed to be continuously distributed. The simulated results show that large-amplitude steady-state convection rolls can be suppressed by the linear LQG controller action. The Green’s function of the controller gives {{the shape of the}} control action corresponding to a point measurement. In addition, for Rayleigh numbers below the proportional feedback con-trol stability limit, this controller appeared to be effective in damping out steady-state convection rolls as well. However, in a region very near the proportional control stability limit, proportional control action induces subcritical g-type hexagonal convection, which is obtained here through direct simulations. Note that well above this proportional con-trol limit, the LQG <b>still</b> <b>damps</b> out all convection. Check cases to validate the nonlinear plant model are also performed by comparison with published results. 2 A. C. Or and J. L. Speyer 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{a variety}} of situations, {{isolated}} polymer molecules are found in a vacuum and here we examine their properties. Angular momentum conservation is shown to significantly alter the average size of a chain and its conservation is only broken slowly by thermal radiation. The time autocorrelation for monomer position oscillates with a characteristic time proportional to chain length. The oscillations and damping are analyzed in detail. Short range repulsive interactions suppress oscillations and speed up relaxation but stretched chains <b>still</b> show <b>damped</b> oscillatory time correlations.

50|$|Stylists often wash a subject's hair first, so {{that the}} hair is cut while <b>still</b> {{slightly}} <b>damp.</b> Compared to dry hair, wet hair can be easier to manage in a cut/style situation because the added weight and surface tension of the water cause the strands to stretch downward and cling together along the hair's length, holding a line and {{making it easier for}} the stylist to create a form. It {{is important to note that}} this method of cutting hair while wet, may be most suitable (or common) for straight hair types. Curly, kinky and other types of hair textures with considerable volume may benefit from cutting while dry, as the hair is in a more natural state and the hair can be cut evenly.|$|R
