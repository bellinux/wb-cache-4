5000|$|According to {{the reactor}} design specification, the uranium hydride core is {{surrounded}} by hydrogen-absorbing <b>storage</b> <b>trays,</b> made of depleted uranium or thorium. The <b>storage</b> <b>trays</b> can either desorb or absorb the hydrogen gas from the core. During normal operation (with the operating temperature being approximately [...] ), the <b>storage</b> <b>trays</b> are kept at a temperature high enough to expel the hydrogen gas to the core. The <b>storage</b> <b>trays</b> are heated or cooled by means of heat pipes and an external thermal source. Thus, in a steady state, the uranium hydride core is slaved to {{the temperature of the}} <b>storage</b> <b>trays.</b> Other heat pipes, protruding the uranium hydride core, deliver the nuclear generated heat from the core to a heat exchanger, which in turn can be connected to a steam turbine-generator set, for the production of electricity.|$|R

50|$|No {{prototype}} {{of this type}} of reactor has been realized yet, although the nuclear processes have been modeled with MCNP. As the concept of a uranium hydride reactor is novel, further experimental work will be needed with regard to gas flow dynamics, materials selection and performance (especially with regard to hydrogen embrittlement and hydride pyrophoricity), radiation damage and fission fragment buildup. A further challenge will be posed by the remote temperature control of the <b>storage</b> <b>trays</b> as well as cooling these trays when it may be necessary, so they absorb hydrogen from the core (absorption itself releases heat which first must be evacuated before more hydrogen can be absorbed by the <b>storage</b> <b>trays).</b>|$|R

50|$|Like {{many new}} wargame {{companies}} in the early '70s, early SPI games left {{a lot to be}} desired physically. A typical early game came in an envelope with a one-color map and one large folded sheet for the rules. However, SPI quickly set about improving the physical quality of the components with better printing and boxes under the guidance of Art Director Redmond A. Simonsen. In 1973, they introduced a flat plastic box that was molded to be a counter <b>storage</b> <b>tray</b> with a clear cover. The actual cover of the game was a printed sheet that backed the clear plastic. This allowed SPI to produce the boxes in bulk, as they were identical for each game, the printed sheet provided the cover and could be printed with all the other components of the game. This system became the hallmark of SPI games, and was later emulated by Simulations Canada, whose early games utilized a smaller <b>storage</b> <b>tray,</b> with the cover of the rules booklet doubling as the cover sheet.|$|E

Remote monitoring technologies are being evaluated to verify their capability to enhance the effectiveness and timeliness of IAEA safeguards in storage facilities while reducing the costs of inspections and burdens on the operator. Phase one of the field trial, which involved proving the satellite transmission of sensor data and safeguards images from a video camera activated by seals and motion sensors installed in the vault, was completed in September 1995. Phase two involves formal testing of the RMS {{as a tool for}} use by the IAEA during their tasks of monitoring the storage of nuclear material. The field trial to be completed during early 1997 includes access and item monitoring of nuclear materials in two <b>storage</b> <b>trays.</b> The RMS includes a variety of Sandia, Oak Ridge, and Aquila sensor technologies that provide video monitoring, radiation attribute measurements, and container identification to the on-site data acquisition system (DAS) by way of radio-frequency and Echelon LONWorks networks.

50|$|The largest {{construction}} or workplace utility knives typically feature retractable and replaceable blades, made of either die-cast metal or molded plastic. Some use standard razor blades, others specialized double-ended utility blades. The user can adjust {{how far the}} blade extends from the handle, so that, for example, the knife {{can be used to}} cut the tape sealing a package without damaging the contents of the package. When the blade becomes dull, it can be quickly reversed or switched for a new one. Spare or used blades are stored in the hollow handle of some models, and can be accessed by removing a screw and opening the handle. Other models feature a quick-change mechanism that allows replacing the blade without tools, as well as a flip-out blade <b>storage</b> <b>tray.</b> The blades for this type of utility knife come in both double- and single-ended versions, and are interchangeable with many, but not all, of the later copies. Specialized blades also exist for cutting string, linoleum, and other materials.|$|E
50|$|Portable icemakers are {{units that}} can fit on a countertop. They are the fastest and {{smallest}} icemakers on the market. The ice {{produced by a}} portable icemaker is bullet shaped and has a cloudy, opaque appearance. The first batch of ice can be made within 10 minutes of turning the appliance on and adding water. The water is pumped into a small tube with metal pegs immersed in the water. Because the unit is portable, water must be filled manually. The water is pumped {{from the bottom of}} the reservoir to the freeze tray. The pegs use a heating and cooling system inside to freeze the water around them and then heat up so the ice slips off the peg and into the storage bin. Ice begins to form in a matter of minutes, however, the size of ice cubes depends on the freezing cycle - a longer cycle results in thicker cubes. Portable icemakers will not keep the ice from melting, but the appliance will recycle the water to make more ice.

Tray freeze-dryers can dry products in bulk or in vials or other containers. When drying in vials, the freeze-dryer is supplied with a stoppering mechanism that allows a stopper to be pressed into place, sealing the vial before it is exposed to the atmosphere. This is used for long-term storage, such as vaccines.|$|R

5000|$|A facelifted model (the AS) {{arrived to}} Australia in September 1985. This {{comprised}} minor restyling {{to the front}} and rear, a comprehensively updated interior, improved suspension, revised trim and more features. Front turn signals were relocated from the headlamps to the bumper, with side repeaters added to the wrap-around sections of the front bumper. Taillamps for the sedan were restyled, and all models received new hubcaps or alloys. GL was now fitted with a left-hand side wing mirror, with Ghia models gaining electric mirror operation. The AS update also benefited from tinted side and rear glass for the GL sedan. Analogue instrumentation was now standard across the range, dispensing with the digital setup used previously by the TX5 Ghia. The new centre console housed audio equipment, a <b>storage</b> <b>tray,</b> gear lever and, on Ghia models, power window switches. Telstar GL and the base TX5 offered a more basic hand brake console integrating an ashtray for rear passengers. Ghia models featured an armrest console with acrylic [...] "smoked glass" [...] lid to provide extra storage. Compared to the AR series, console storage space for Ghia models was increased, as was glove compartment capacity across all trims. The seats were also revised—the work of Ford Australia—and a modification that only applied to the Ford-badged cars. Other interior changes included those made to the stalk-mounted switchgear, and a new digital clock in the centre of the dashboard benefitting from a glare-prevention hood. The clock was previously located awkwardly ahead of the gear lever.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} storage, significant differences were observed (P≤ 0. 05) in the amino acids isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, valine, glutamic acid and glycine between the control lot and the treated lots, and it was the control lot which exhibited the highest concentrations. However, the lots kept in special atmospheres exhibited higher levels of alanine, β-alanine, threonine, and tryptophan than the control lot. There was no relationship between the decreases in histidine, tyrosine, lysine, arginine and ornithine initial concentrations and the increases in their corresponding biogenic amine concentrations (histamine, tyramine, cadaverine, agmatine and putrescine, respectively) which appeared as a result of decomposition of fish by decarboxylation of the FAA. Significant differences (P≤ 0. 05) were observed in the biogenic amine concentrations among the lots kept under special atmospheres. The bulk-stored lot in controlled atmosphere for the first 12 days and then packed in trays with modified atmospheres exhibited the lowest levels of biogenic amines, except for agmatine, throughout storage. © Springer-Verlag 2002.
