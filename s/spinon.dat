50|$|In {{condensed}} matter physics, {{spin-charge separation}} {{is an unusual}} behavior of electrons in some materials in which they 'split' into three independent particles, the <b>spinon,</b> the orbiton and the holon (or chargon). The electron can always be theoretically considered as a bound state of the three, with the <b>spinon</b> carrying the spin of the electron, the orbiton carrying the orbital degree of freedom and the chargon carrying the charge, but in certain conditions they can become deconfined and behave as independent particles.|$|E

5000|$|Since the {{original}} electrons {{in the system}} are fermions, one of the <b>spinon</b> and chargon {{has to be a}} fermion, and the other one has to be a boson. One is theoretically free to make the assignment in either way, and no observable quantity can depend on this choice. The formalism with bosonic chargon and fermionic <b>spinon</b> is usually referred to as the [...] "slave-fermion" [...] formalism, while the formalism with fermionic chargon and bosonic <b>spinon</b> is called the [...] "Schwinger boson" [...] formalism. Both approaches have been used for strongly correlated systems, but neither has been proved to be completely successful. One difficulty of the spin-charge separation is that while <b>spinon</b> and chargon are not gauge-invariant quantities, i.e. unphysical objects, there are no direct physical probes to observe them. Therefore more often than not one has to use thermal dynamical or macroscopic techniques to see their effects. This implies that which formalism we choose is irrelevant to real physics, so in principle both approaches should give us the same answer. The reason we obtain radically different answers from these two formalisms is probably because of the wrong mean field solution we choose, which means that we are dealing with the spin-charge separation in a wrong way.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the {{quantum phase transition}} from antiferromagnetism (AF) to algebraic spin liquid (ASL). We propose that spin 1 / 2 fermionic <b>spinons</b> in the ASL fractionalize into spin 1 / 2 bosonic <b>spinons</b> and spinless fermions at the quantum critical point (QCP) between the AF and the ASL. Condensation of the bosonic <b>spinons</b> leads to the AF, where the condensed bosonic <b>spinons</b> are confined with the spinless fermions to form the fermionic <b>spinons.</b> These fermionic <b>spinons</b> are also confined to make antiferromagnons as elementary excitations in the AF. Approaching the QCP from the AF, spin 1 critical antiferromagnetic fluctuations are expected to break up into spin 1 / 2 critical bosonic <b>spinons.</b> Then, these bosonic <b>spinons</b> hybridize with spin 1 / 2 fermionic <b>spinons,</b> making spinless fermions. As a result the fermionic <b>spinons</b> decay into the bosonic <b>spinons</b> and the spinless fermions. But, the spinless fermions are confined and thus, only the bosonic <b>spinons</b> emerge at the QCP. This coincides with the recent studies of deconfined quantum criticalityLaughlin_deconfinement,Senthil_deconfinement,Kim 1,Ichinose_de confinement.

40|$|Electron fractionalization into <b>spinons</b> and chargeons plays {{a crucial}} role in 2 D models of {{strongly}} correlated electrons. In this paper we show that spin-charge separation is not a phenomenon confined to lower dimensions but, rather, we present a field-theoretic model in which it is realized in 3 D. The model involves two gauge fields, a standard one and a two-form gauge field. The physical picture is that of a two-fluid model of chargeons and <b>spinons</b> interacting by the topological BF term. When a Higgs mechanism of the second kind for the two-form gauge field takes place, chargeons and <b>spinons</b> are bound together into a charge 1 particle with spin 1 / 2.

The IXY fixed point is shown to be unstable against instanton excitations and the instanton excitations are proliferated. At the IXY fixed point it is the Berry phase effect that suppresses the instanton excitations, causing the deconfinement of <b>spinons.</b> On the other hand, the XY fixed point is found to be stable against instanton excitations because an effective internal charge is zero at the neutral XY fixed point.

In dimension d> 1, the issue of <b>spinons</b> as elementary excitations is still unsettled. In this paper, we study two spin- 1 / 2 AFM ladder models in which the individual chains are described by the Ising-like Heisenberg Hamiltonian.

Using the low-energy effective Hamiltonian approach in a perturbative formulation, we show that the <b>spinons</b> are coupled in bound pairs.

Our formulation makes explicit the existence of a local SU(2) gauge symmetry once the spin- 1 / 2 operators are replaced by bound states of <b>spinons.</b> The mean-field theory for the <b>spinons</b> is solved numerically as a function of the ratio J 2 /J 1 for the so-called s-RVB Ansatz. A second order phase transition exists into a novel flux state for J 2 /J 1 > (J 2 /J 1) cr. We identify the range 0 < J 2 /J 1 < (J 2 /J 1) cr as the s-RVB phase.
