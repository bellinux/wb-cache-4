40|$|<b>Sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> is {{a marine}} teleost of {{increasing}} interest for Mediterranean aquaculture, {{but there is}} still a lack of information regarding its circadian organization. In this study, we have investigated <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> locomotor activity, feeding and plasma melatonin daily rhythms under a 12 : 12 -h LD cycle, as well as the persistence of locomotor activity circadian rhythmicity under constant light (LL) conditions. When submitted to an LD cycle, most <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> displayed a diurnal locomotor pattern, with an average 74 % of activity recorded during daytime. However, along the experiment 40 % of fish spontaneously changed their locomotor rhythm phasing and became nocturnal. Feeding behaviour, nevertheless, remained strictly diurnal in all cases, with 97 % of food demands being made during the light period. Free-running locomotor rhythms were recorded in one third of the fish kept under LL. Daily plasma melatonin levels displayed a rhythmic profile, with low daytime values (111 pg/ml) and high nighttime concentrations (791 pg/ml). Taken together, these results evidence a high degree of plasticity for <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> activity patterns, as well as phasing independence of locomotor and feeding rhythms. Finally, the existence of a well-defined daily rhythm of plasma melatonin was found...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream,</b> (Diplodus puntazzo) is {{the third}} most farmed marine teleost species in Italy. Fish {{reproduction}} in aquaculture facilities is mainly obtained through environmental/pharmacological conditioning. These techniques may stress fish and decrease reproductive performances. Endogenous opioid peptides (EOPs) system is involved in stress response, and affects several physiological functions, both in central nervous system and in peripheral tissues. EOPs act through their specific cell membrane receptors (EOPr). The aim {{of the work is}} to evaluate the expression and localization of mu, delta and κappa opioid receptors in <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> milt by means of indirect immunofluorescence. Results show that mu opioid receptor is predominant localized on the tail, while delta and kappa seem to be located on the head. Opioid receptors detection on <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> milt let us suppose that the opioidergic system could modulate sperm motility, so that the use of opioid antagonists in fish farm could be useful to decrease stress effects on reproductive performances...|$|E

At {{the end of}} the experimental period (114 days), four fish per diet were randomly sampled. The partial substitution of fish meal (FM) with SBM affected the intestine histology and macromorphology of <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> and modified the enterocyte parameters. The addition of prebiotics has not produced positive effects, leading in some cases to a worsening, especially for INU diet that markedly altered the intestine histology. The micromorphological values were in both proximal and distal intestines significantly affected by the diet: in proximal tract, the nucleus was closer to the apex of the enterocyte in soy-fed fish (SBM, IMU, MOS diets), while fish fed with MOS diet showed the lowest value of enterocyte height, significantly different from the FM diet. In distal tract of intestine, fish fed with FM diet showed the highest value for all considered parameters, while MOS diet resulted in the lowest enterocyte height and supranucleus height among the four diets. SBM-containing diets (SBM, IMU, MOS) resulted in lower values than FM diet for the features of enterocyte nucleus. Microvilli height was not affected by the diet in both proximal and distal tracts.

The number of vertebrae, anal fin hard rays and dorsal fin hard rays was constant and did not vary with size. Seventeen types of skeletal and fin anomalies were observed, but no grave anomalies were found, such as the absence of a swimbladder, lordosis, kyphosis and calculi in the terminal tract of the urinary duct. The most prevalent anomalies were associated with the fins, especially E 7 (pectoral fin rays), F 7 (anal fin rays) and I 7 (dorsal fin soft rays).

40|$|Endogenous opioid {{peptides}} (EOP) are molecules affecting many biological functions influencing {{productive and}} reproductive performance. They increase in stress conditions {{and interact with}} specific opioidergic receptors (OR) : delta, kappa and mu. Several studies in other animal species suggest that they can also affect sperm cell motility. In fish the ionic external environment modulates the increase of intracellular calcium ion that is required to activate sperm motility after spawning. In mammals OR are functionally associated to calcium channels and in fishes calcium is highly required for fish sperm activation. In this study the presence of OR on spermatozoa of two Perciform fish, the <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus puntazzo, family Sparidae) and the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax, family Moronidae) was investigated; the two species were chosen for their importance in Mediterranean aquaculture. The analysis by indirect immunofluorescence evidenced the presence of OR on sperm cells of these fishes. Delta, kappa and mu opioid receptors appeared differently localized {{on the surface of}} the sperm cells of <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> and European sea bass. Opioidergic receptors on fish spermatozoa could be a new target for reducing stress associated to captivity reproduction in fish farms by EOP antagonists...|$|E

The fish came from three different conditions: reared in marine cages (R), captured in a natural lagoon (L) and in the Mediterranean sea (S). Thirty fish per group, divided into three weight categories (100 ± 15. 3, 200 ± 18. 7 and 300 ± 20. 4 g), were used for the trial. Reared <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> showed higher amounts of celomatic fat (3. 41 %, 2. 43 %, 0. 21 %, respectively for R, L and S) and total lipid (13. 86 %, 11. 23 % and 5. 06 % respectively for R, L and S), and lower moisture (64. 14 %, 65. 54 %, 71. 53 %) and protein (17. 73, 19. 03 and 19. 17 %) than those caught in the lagoon and sea. The whole body of reared fish contained lower amounts of lead (0. 70, 0. 75 and 0. 97 mg/kg, respectively for R, L and S), copper (0. 15, 0. 38, 0. 25 mg/kg) chrome (2. 19, 3. 52, 3. 77 mg/kg) and higher zinc contents (63. 47, 53. 42, 47. 31 mg/kg) than caught fish. Fatty acids from <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> fillets showed a high lipid quality as confirmed also by low values of Thrombogenic index (0. 36, 0. 30 and 0. 22, respectively for L, S, R) and Atherogenic index (0. 47, 0. 42 and 0. 33, respectively for L, S, R).

40|$|E. leei affects {{at least}} 25 fish species but it {{represents}} a production limiting factor most of all for sharpnout seabream, causing high mortality {{during the first year}} of rearing (Diamant, 1995; Athanassopoulou et al., 1999). The knowledge on the immune response of <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus puntazzo, Cetti 1777) is lacking, even if recently some innate immune parameters were studied owing to experimental myxozoan transmission in different marine species (Karagouni et al., 2005; Golomazou et al., 2006). In particular the innate immune response against E. scophthalmi was studied in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) (Sitjà-Bobadilla et al., 2006). The aim of this study was to evaluate serum complement and lysozyme activity, serum protein, peroxidase and immunoglobulin content in physiological conditions and during E. leei infection. Moreover the morphometry of peripheral blood leukocytes and the differential leucocyte counts were investigated on blood smears. Fish collected during spontaneous disease outbreaks, occurring in Italian fish farms, and a healthy fish group (control) were submitted to the immunological analysis. Lymphocytes, neutrophilic, acidophilic and occasionally basophilic granulocytes and monocyte-macrophages have been differentiated in peripheral blood of <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream.</b> In the light of the morphological findings, a cell population resambling the mammalian natural killer cells has been observed.

Average water temper- ature was 21. 9 ± 1. 6 °C, salinity was 30. 0 ‰ and pH ranged from 7 to 8. Four isonitrogenous- isolipidic diets were tested: a control diet (FM) with fish meal as the sole protein source; a second diet (SBM) with approximately 40 % of the protein supplied by soybean meal. The remaining two diets were formulated adding 8 g of MOS and FOS per kg of the SBM diet respectively. Average final weight, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio and protein efficiency ratio remained unaffected by partial fish meal substitution and by MOS or FOS sup- plementation.

In order {{to detect the}} main types of body deformation in <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream.</b> 120 specimens (60 juveniles and 60 adults) taken from a Mediterranean hatchery were examined. In juveniles and adults non-significant {{differences were found in}} the number of vertebrae, dorsal spines and pectoral fin rays. Moreover, the number of anomalies varied with age. The juveniles presented 28 types of anomaly, the adults 25. The most important anomalies for juveniles (in terms of frequency of occurrence) were anomalous neural arch or spine (47 %), anomalous hemal arch or spine (43 %), fusion of hypurals (67 %) and presence of calculi in the terminal tract of urinary ducts (43 %), while for adults were anomalous neural arch or spine (43 %), fusion of hypurals (90 %) and fusion of epurals (37 %). While anomalous hemal arch or spine and presence of calculi in the terminal tract of urinary ducts decreased with age, fusion of hypurals and fusion of epurals increased. Lordosis and kyphosis were found in a slight form only in juveniles and with a low frequency of occurrence. These decreased or disappeared in adults. No mortality was detected either in juveniles or in adults. In any case, these anomalies did not influence the growth performance of juveniles and no lethal anomalies were detected...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus puntazzo) were fed three {{experimental}} isonitrogenous diets composed of 45 g 100 g- 1 protein and varying lipid and fibre contents as follows: diet A: 45 / 10 / 1. 5, B: 45 / 15 / 1. 5 and C: 45 / 15 / 5. The {{effects of the}} diet composition were investigated by measuring digestibility, growth, carcass composition and haematological parameters. The apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) for proteins, fats and carbohydrates, measured at high (26 ˚C) and low (16 ˚C) water temperatures in laboratory conditions, were not affected by the diet or temperature treatments. Growth was evaluated in a seven-month trial using animals held in sea cages. The specific growth rate (SGR) showed no significant differences among the treatments while the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly improved in the fish that were fed a low-fat diet. A significant increase in body fat was detected in the fish that were fed high-fat diets. The blood serum total lipid levels were elevated for the fish that were fed diet C. In conclusion, a diet containing a protein/fat/fibre ratio of 45 / 10 / 1. 5 g 100 g- 1 can result in satisfactory growth and an improved FCR value when compared with diets with higher fat and/or fibre levels, demonstrating that the required fat level for <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> is lower than 15 g 100 g- 1...|$|E
40|$|Mixed {{function}} oxidase (MFO) {{activities and}} organochlorine levels were investigated in liver of farmed <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> bred in two intensive facilities, a sea farm and a land-based farm. The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate how different facility locations and breeding conditions might affect fish metabolic capabilities and accumulation of toxic chemicals in farmed <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream.</b> The differences between breeding two or more fish species in the same cage or tank known as polyculture and monoculture (1 species) were also investigated. The results showed that both facility location (sea and land) as well as breeding systems (polyculture and monoculture) might be responsible for the differences observed in both MFO enzyme activity and organochlorine levels. Significantly higher activities of two metabolizing enzymes such as 7 -ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and benzo(a) pyrene monooxygenase (B(a) PMO) were in fact recorded in land-based farmed fish than in sea farmed ones, and much higher in those from polyculture than in monoculture (p< 0. 05). By contrast, the highest levels of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethilene (ppDDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs as Aroclor 1260) were measured in sea-farmed fish, except for hexachlorobenzene (HCB), which gave higher levels in land-based farmed fishes. No significant differences were observed between monoculture and polyculture in p,pDDE and PCBs levels except for p,pDDE which was significantly higher in monoculture than in polyculture (p< 0. 05) in fish reared in tanks. Finally significantly higher HCB levels were measured in fish reared in monoculture in tanks (p< 0. 05) and in polyculture in cages (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Myxozoans are {{metazoan}} parasites {{which are}} highly pathogenic in commercially important fish, particularly in aquaculture. Enteromyxosis is an economically significant disease {{caused by the}} myxosporean parasite Enteromyxum leei. Presently, early diagnosis of enteromyxosis in <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> was achieved by monitoring fish on a time-scale scheduled basis in combination with a validated molecular diagnostic technique. Two different successive fish batches of a commercial fish farm were monitored starting from {{the first month of}} on-growing in sea cages until fish reached commercial size. Fish weight and water temperature differentially ranged between them. E. leei detection was performed both by classical microscopic observation of fresh smears and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) while prevalence, mean intensity and mortality rate were calculated. In total, 520 fish were screened; 320 from the first batch and 200 from the second one. Parasitosis illustrated a seasonal occurrence pattern (spring and summer). When qPCR was used as a diagnostic method, enteromyxosis was diagnosed earlier with more increased prevalence compared to the microscopic observation. In this case, the parasite was detected at the lowest water temperature that has ever been recorded (14. 7 degrees C), during the first month of on-growing in sea cages. The two-factor combination of water temperature and fish weight proved to be the most significant factor that could determine the emergence and development of parasitosis and smaller fish proved to be more susceptible. Mortality was influenced by both prevalence and intensity of parasitosis. An earlier diagnosis and identification of all developmental stages of the parasite throughout its life cycle was verified with qPCR, significantly before any outbreak occurred. The latter could become a key diagnostic tool for the control of enteromyxosis, allowing stakeholders and fish farmers to adopt all necessary precautionary measures minimizing economic loss in <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> intensive farming...|$|E

We used a mesocosm technique to investigate the susceptibility of <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus puntazzo) larvae to potential environmental pathogens in seawater compared to control borehole water. Fish exposed to seawater succumbed to epitheliocystis from 21 days post hatching, causing mortality in {{a quarter of the}} hosts. The pathogen responsible was not chlamydial, as is often found in epitheliocystis, but a novel species of the γ-proteobacterial genus Endozoicomonas. Detailed characterisation of this pathogen within the infectious lesions using high resolution fluorescent and electron microscopy showed densely packed rod shaped bacteria. A draft genome sequence of this uncultured bacterium was obtained from preserved material. Comparison with the genome of the Endozoicomonas elysicola type strain shows that the genome of Ca. Endozoicomonas cretensis is undergoing decay through loss of functional genes and insertion sequence expansion, often indicative of adaptation to a new niche or restriction to an alternative lifestyle.

The first anlage of the thymus developed by d 20 postfertilisation (p. f.) {{as a group of}} undifferentiated cells dorsal to the epithelium of the branchial chamber. The organ increased significantly in size around d 51 – 66 p. f. and differentiation of cortex and medulla occurred concomitantly. On the basis of their localisation, 4 main types of epithelial cell were distinguished: (1) limiting, adjacent to the connective capsule; (2) medullary and cortical reticular cells; (3) nurse cells, located in the corticomedullary boundary; (4) Hassall-like corpuscles. The majority of medium to large blast-like lymphoid cells were localised in the medulla, while small lymphocytes were housed in the cortical region. These morphological features were maintained at later stages. However, in juveniles in the medulla we observed reticular epithelial cells with cysts and rare Hassall-like corpuscles.

Rearing in the offshore cage (lot B) {{had a significant effect}} on shape variation when compared to rearing in the two enclosed tanks (A and C). Fish from the tanks show a higher frequency (43. 74 % in lot A and 37. 5 % in lot C) of the so-called 'goitred' and 'dorsal flat' forms, their deformations shown by displacements in the corresponding landmarks of the infraopercular and dorsal areas. In contrast, the so-called 'belly' fish were more numerous in lot B (66. 7 %). These changes in shape are mostly related to a non-uniform variation (i. e. not due to shearing and dilation but localised in some body areas) and the differences were shown to be statistically significant between the lots. Finally, more than 90 % of the variation in shape was left unexplained by the regressions of shape variables over size (expressed as weight in grams and centroid size).

At 5, 12, 19, 26, 40 and 55 days post-exposure (p. e.), control and recipient fish were sampled to determine the prevalence of infection and some humoral innate immune parameters (antiprotease, antitumoral and peroxidase activities). Prevalence of infection was high from day 12 p. e. and reached 100 % at days 40 and 55, when intensity of infection was medium to severe. The antiprotease activity was significantly increased in E. leei-exposed fish with respect to control fish at days 12 and 19 p. e. The serum antitumoral activity was slightly lower in recipient than in control fish at all sampling times, except at 40 days p. e., though no statistically significant differences were observed. Serum peroxidases were higher in all recipient fish than in control ones, with the highest stimulation index at 40 days p. e. Within recipient fish, no differences were detected between sampling times in any of the measured activities. The possible implication of these immune factors in the high susceptibility of D. puntazzo to this enteromyxosis is discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Within a {{two years}} project (2004 - 2006) on the {{pathological}} effects of parasites on marine fish farmed in Italy, the gill histopathological changes referable to monogenean infections have been studied. The most representative fish species of Italian mariculture were examined: European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus puntazzo), coming from different farming systems (extensive/intensive inland farms, inshore/offshore sea cages). Gill samples {{were obtained from}} parasitized fish after identification of gill monogeneans and evaluation of their infection intensity. Gills were fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin and subjected to histological examination with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Giemsa and Crossmon's Trichromic stains. Concerning European sea bass, only Diplectanum aequans was observed, with highest prevalence and infection intensity in inland and inshore sea cage systems. Histological changes were observed mainly at infection intensity > 200 parasites/gill arch, with hyperplasia of lamellar epithelium, haemorrhages and phlogosis. Lamellar oedema was also frequently evident; mucous cells were generally hyperplasic and hypertrophic. With reference to gilthead sea bream, Sparicotyle chrysophrii and Furnestinia echeneis were respectively found in sea cages (both inshore and offshore) and in inland and inshore cage systems. No pathological signs were referred to F. echeneis infections, also with 50 specimens/gill arch infection intensity. On the contrary, the polyopisthocotylean S. chrysophrii showed a high pathogenicity at low infection intensity (8 parasites/gill arch) with gross lesions such as gill and systemic anaemia already noticeable at necropsy. In this case histology showed severe hyperplasia of gill epithelium with thickening of lamellae up to fusion, and heavy sloughing off of the epithelial cells. Moreover the gills showed diffused degeneration and necrosis in the residual epithelial tissue. The hematophagous attitude of S. chrysophrii was evident {{for the presence of}} several erythrocytes in the parasite gut. Also in sharpsnout sea bream, both monopisthocotylean and polyopisthocotylean species, respectively Lamellodiscus spp. and Polylabris spp., were found during this survey. Sporadic cases of host switching by S. chrysophrii and F. echeneis were also observed in <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> with low prevalence and intensity. Histopathological lesions were observed in gills infected by Lamellodiscus spp. only when its number was > 100 specimens/gill arch, with haemorrhages, congestion, oedema and mild epithelial hyperplasia, focal necrosis and cellular sloughing off. Likely S. chrysophrii, Polylabris spp. appeared to cause severe gill anaemia at low infection intensity (8 - 10 parasites/gill arch). Histopathological examination showed diffuse oedema, mild hyperplasia, necrosis and sloughing off of the epithelial cells with karyorrhexis and pyknosis of nuclei. Although gill monogenean infestations have to be considered always detrimental to respiratory function of the host, mainly polyopisthocotyleans play a high pathogenic role apart from infection intensity while monopisthocotyleans cause histopathological changes strictly correlated to the parasitic burden...|$|E

The results concerned four ontogenetical stages of sharpsnout seabream: larval, post-larval, transitional, and juvenile stages. The yolk-sac larval stage was not detected as the smallest larvae at our disposal (3. 1 mm TL; 2 nd day from hatching) showed no external appearance of the yolk. During the larval stage (3. 1 – 4. 7 mm TL), <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> is equipped with free neuromasts and olfactory ciliated receptor cells. In the post-larval stage (5 – 28. 6 mm TL), mechano- and chemo-reception is implemented: {{the inner and outer}} taste buds differentiation, the nasal formation, the lateral line system canalization occur. The precocious differentiation of chemo-receptors makes post-larvae particularly sensitive to the organoleptic properties of administered preys. D. puntazzo, {{at the end of this}} phase, could be considered a juvenile (complete squamation is acquired), except for the mouth and pharyngeal teeth. During the subsequent phase (‘transitional’), in fact, eight chisel-type and two lateral series of molar-like teeth progressively substituted the conical ones on each jaw, and three different types of teeth on the upper and lower pharynx differentiated. So, the juvenile phase is reached in individuals longer than 58 mm TL...|$|E
40|$|Free, amoeboid {{movement}} of organisms within media {{as well as}} substrate-dependent cellular crawling processes of cells and organisms require an actin cytoskeleton. This system is also involved in the cytokinetic processes of all eukaryotic cells. Myxozoan parasites are known for the disease they cause in economical important fishes. Usually, their pathology is related to rapid proliferation in the host. However, the sequences of their development are still poorly understood, {{especially with regard to}} pre-sporogonic proliferation mechanisms. The present work employs light microscopy (LM), electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in combination with specific stains (Nile Red, DAPI, Phalloidin), to study the three-dimensional morphology, motility, ultrastructure and cellular composition of Ceratomyxa puntazzi, a myxozoan inhabiting the bile of the <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream.</b> Our results demonstrate the occurrence of two C. puntazzi developmental cycles in the bile, i. e. pre-sporogonic proliferation including frequent budding as well as sporogony, resulting in the formation of durable spore stages and we provide unique details on the ultrastructure and the developmental sequence of bile inhabiting myxozoans. The present study describes, for the first time, the cellular components and mechanisms involved in the motility of myxozoan proliferative stages, and reveals how the same elements are implicated in the processes of budding and cytokinesis in the Myxozoa. We demonstrate that F-actin rich cytoskeletal elements polarize {{at one end of the}} parasites and in the filopodia which are rapidly de novo created and re-absorbed, thu...|$|E

40|$|Aquaculture is {{a growing}} {{agricultural}} sector that due to the actual market saturation by sea bass and gilthead sea bream, needs for new fish species diversification. Sparid fishes are important candidates for species diversification in the Mediterranean aquaculture. Under culture conditions, parasites may cause serious problems. This thesis aims to improve our knowledge of myxozoan and aporocotylid parasites in sparids which are new candidates or existing Mediterranean aquaculture species. The present study seeks to identify, describe and clarify the taxonomic position of the parasite taxa by morphological and molecular approaches, and by defining their phylogenetical position and relationship with previously described species. Development, habitat selection in the host and pathology are analysed in order to evaluate the pathogenic potential of the parasites described. Also this thesis focuses {{on the study of}} parasite life cycles, seasonality, transmission and routes of infection in the fish host, with the final aim to provide information allowing for the development of management strategies for aquaculture systems. The study led to the following findings and conclusions: -A new genus and species of blood fluke, Skoulekia meningialis n. gen., n. sp. was described from the common two-banded seabream Diplodus vulgaris in a non common location, the ectomeningeal veins surrounding the optic lobes of the brain. The adults of S. meningialis were found to cause mild, chronic, localised meningitis. Its special location surrounding a vital organ should be kept in mind when establishing D. vulgaris in aquaculture systems. -Large cysts of myxosporean spores of the species Unicapsula pflugfelderi were detected in the fillets of sand steenbras Lithognathus mormyrus. Myoliquefaction process was not found to occur in U. pflugfelderi. However, the massive presence of macroscopic plasmodia in the fillets of L. mormyrus could produce marketing problems, affecting to the potential of the sand steenbras as an aquaculture candidate. -A new myxozoan parasite Ceratomyxa puntazzi n. sp. was found to cause histopathological changes in the liver and in the gall bladder of the <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> Diplodus puntazzo and has to be considered as an opportunistic parasite in immunocompromised hosts. The genus Ceratomyxa seems to be very host-specific in sparids and high species diversity can be expected in Mediterranean sparids. The phylogenetical analyses revealed that all ceratomyxid species of sparids from the Mediterranean rise from a common ancestor. -This thesis provides unique insights into the development and cellular organisation of the myxozoan C. puntazzi. This study is the first use of confocal laser scanning microscopy with specific stains on developmental stages of a myxozoan. C. puntazzi seems to follow a sequence of development with two pathways in the bile: pre-sporogonic proliferative development where stages show high degree of motility, cellular divisions and budding by plasmotomy, and sporogonic development, characterized by the formation and maturation of spores. For the first time in myxozoans, motility and the distribution of potential effectors of motility were analysed. F-actin rich cytoskeletal elements were found to concentrate {{at one end of the}} parasite, which produces localised filopodia, thus facilitating parasite motility. The mechanism of budding was identified, for the first time, as an active F-actin dependent separation process. -Natural exposures of <b>sharpsnout</b> <b>seabream</b> to a C. puntazzi enzootic habitat are the first attempt of conducting a seasonality study in marine myxozoans and provide important insights into the seasonal patterns of myxozoan abundance in a temperate marine environment. C. puntazzi infection in the bile shows a marked temperature-related seasonality, with visual detection of parasites exclusively between April - November. However, PCR detection in the bile is possible all year round. Blood stages were detected all year round by PCR. This indicates that actinospores are present in the sea water and the blood of exposed fish is invaded throughout the whole year. Implications for D. puntazzo culture are discussed. La acuicultura mediterránea necesita diversificación de especies de peces para el cultivo debido a la saturación del mercado con dorada y lubina. En condiciones de cultivo, los peces pueden verse afectados por diversos patógenos, entre ellos los parásitos. Entre los parásitos mas problemáticos en la acuicultura mediterránea, figuran los mixozoos y los aporocotílidos. En esta tesis doctoral se presentan nuevas y se aportan nuevos datos de especies ya descritas de estos dos grupos parásitos, se estudia la relación parasito-hospedador y se incluyen nuevos datos del desarrollo, rutas de infección, ciclo de vida y estacionalidad en especies de peces candidatas para el cultivo. Un nuevo género y especie de aporocotílido Skoulekia meningialis n. gen. n. sp. se halló en un hábitat poco común, las venas ectomeningeales del cerebro de la mojarra Diplodus vulgaris, donde los adultos provocan una meningitis moderada pero crónica. Plasmodios alargados con esporas del mixozoo Unicapsula pflugfelderi se hallaron en la musculatura de la herrera Lithognathus mormyrus y aunque no se observó mioliquefaccion, la presencia masiva de estas estructuras en los filetes puede afectar al potencial de la herrera como especie para la acuicultura. Ceratomyxa puntazzi n. sp. es una nueva especie de mixozoo descrita de la vesícula biliar del sargo picudo Diplodus puntazzo. C. puntazzi provoca cambios histopatológicos en el hígado y la vesícula biliar del sargo picudo y debe considerarse como un patógeno oportunista. C. puntazzi forma parte del complejo de especies del género Ceratomyxa hallado en espáridos del Mediterráneo los cuales provienen de un ancestro común. Dentro del estudio de C. puntazzi, se describen los componentes celulares, y los mecanismos que intervienen en la motilidad de los mixozoos y como estos elementos están implicados en los procesos de gemación y citocinesis en los mixozoos. Experimentos de transmisión con jaulas en el mar a un medio natural enzoótico para C. puntazzi reveló una estacionalidad marcada, con presencia de esporas en la bilis de Abril a Noviembre, pero con detección por PCR durante todo el año tanto en la bilis como en la sangre. Estos resultados tienen implicaciones para el manejo del cultivo del sargo picudo...|$|E
