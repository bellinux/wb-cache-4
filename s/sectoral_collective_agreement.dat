For trade unions, extension cuts two ways (Flanagan et al. 1993 : 424): by eliminating the competition from low wage non-union firms or sectors, legal extension reduces the incentives for employer resistance to unions. It also reduces the incentives for consumers to shift purchases to the non-union sector and therefore increases union bargaining power. On the other hand, by providing for free what unions charge for, legal extension encourages ‘free riders’ among potential union members.|$|E

30|$|A {{move toward}} partial {{decentralization}} of the bargaining framework was initiated in 2006 but the changes {{did not fully}} go into effect immediately. The Collective Agreement Act 2006 provided for collective agreements to be negotiated on a voluntary basis, but the prevailing practice of full coverage of general and sectoral agreements was to remain in effect for a three-year transitional period. Until 2005, the general agreement {{at the national level}} was negotiated on a tripartite basis between the trade unions, employers and government. From 2006 onward, the government stopped participating in the negotiations. Collective bargaining at the sectoral level gained in importance and became dominant. However, the social partners continued to negotiate a general agreement on starting pay and minimum basic pay increases as well as inflation safeguard clause that would apply to all workers in the private sector who were not covered by sectoral collective agreements or whose <b>sectoral</b> <b>collective</b> <b>agreement</b> did not determine the pay adjustment supplement. The sectoral agreements were required by law to set terms at least as favorable as those in the general intersectoral agreement 8.|$|E
30|$|Notwithstanding a {{decrease}} in trade union density, virtually all employees in Slovenia have been covered by collective agreements over the years. In 2007, 96 percent of employees were covered by collective agreements and the remaining 4  percent of employees, comprising of managerial workers, were covered by individual agreements (European Industrial Relations Observatory On-line (EIROnline) 2009 b). Until 2005, the extension procedure of collective agreements was based on “functional equivalent”, in that because of compulsory membership of enterprises in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry the agreements were binding for all employers and their employees (Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development (IMAD) 2004). Membership in employers’ associations ceased to be compulsory from 2006, but the Collective Agreements Act 2006 stipulated that sectoral agreements concluded by associations of employers {{would continue to be}} mandatory for all employers and their employees in the sector for a transitional period of three years. Thereafter, the Act allows for the possibility of extension of a <b>sectoral</b> <b>collective</b> <b>agreement</b> to all employers and employees in the sector if the agreement was signed by representative trade unions and employers that employ at least 50 percent of all employees in the sector and one of the parties seek an extension from the Minister of Labor (European Industrial Relations Observatory On-line (EIROnline) 2009 c); European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) 2011) 6.

A standardized questionnaire measuring self-reported influences of different types of external information was developed and administered to a representative sample of union and firm negotiators in the Netherlands. In total, 123 negotiators participated in the survey. Four types of external information were investigated: 1 - economic information; 2 - information on organizational power; 3 - institutional information; and 4 - information spillovers. Descriptive analyses show that economic information, particularly when referring to the sector level, was very influential, as was institutional information on national and <b>sectoral</b> <b>collective</b> <b>agreement</b> developments. Information reflecting organizational power, e. g. militancy, carried less weight, while information on other bargaining events, i. e. spillover, was also very important. From extant theory, empirical findings and common assumptions in labour relations literature, the paper developed and tested a number of hypotheses concerning the influence of external information. It was found that the influence of spillovers increased with the proximity of their source. Union negotiators were generally more influenced by external information than firm negotiators. There was some evidence that influence increased with experience, but this effect was rather modest. Evidence that negotiators in sector bargaining were less affected by the economic environment than negotiators in company bargaining was weak, but they were found to be less influenced by spillovers and international collective agreement developments...|$|E

30|$|Another change {{regarding}} {{collective bargaining}} in Germany is {{the increased use}} of collective opening clauses which relate to different aspects of the <b>sectoral</b> <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> (see Brändle et al., 2011; Kohaut and Schnabel, 2007). Some clauses lead to more flexibility in working time adjustment and have the same effects on firms’ adjustment behavior as improved opportunity of working time adjustment in general. But opening clauses also increase the flexibility of wages. Therefore, a firm can adjust wages instead of adjusting the number of employees to improve profits in a bad economic situation. Although this an explanation for the results of the mentioned studies using aggregated data, it does not lead to a faster adjustment of the number of employees. However, {{the increased use of}} opening clauses started {{in the middle of the}} 1990 s and is thus not specific to the second business cycle.|$|R
30|$|It {{is often}} {{argued that the}} {{importance}} of collective bargaining is de facto higher than what is reflected in these figures because in many cases, firms that do not fall under a collective bargaining scheme (i.e., are not part of an employers’ association) report that <b>collective</b> bargaining <b>agreements</b> orient their wage policies (Schnabel 2005). Additionally, in 2012, firm-level <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> (Firmentarifverträge) were reached by 7 [*]% of firms in the West and 12 [*]% in the East (see IAB 2014). Overall, however, the coverage of <b>sectoral</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining <b>agreements</b> is declining. This development, which is partly due to structural change in the economy, can be seen as an erosion of a key element of the German model.|$|R
30|$|Looking ahead, {{there is}} a need to examine how {{enterprises}} have adapted to the changes in the institutional aspects of wage-setting and employment relationships, and to conduct in-depth micro data-based analysis of the enterprise behavior prior to the crisis, during the crisis, and after the crisis. Unlike many other European countries, Slovenia did not participate in the follow-up WDN survey that was conducted in 2009 soon after the start of the financial crisis. Thus, a follow-up WDN style survey that takes into account the lessons from the 2008 survey and other follow-up surveys conducted elsewhere is desirable. It would be particularly important in the follow up survey to include questions on the role of the minimum wage in the setting of basic wages in <b>sectoral</b> <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> and its impact on the labor cost adjustment efforts of enterprises. For a comprehensive assessment of enterprise behavior and labor market outcomes, it is not sufficient to focus on existing firms. It would be worthwhile supplementing the survey for existing firms with a small survey of firms that have ceased operations in recent years.|$|R
30|$|In Romania no <b>sectoral</b> <b>collective</b> <b>{{agreements}}</b> {{have been}} signed since 2011 besides {{a handful of}} agreements combining specific company groups. In Bulgaria, the previous trend of sector agreements in manufacturing {{to be replaced by}} company agreements accelerated after 2008, when employers stopped negotiating at the sector level in chemicals, electrical equipment and food processing. According to a state inspectorate’s report collective bargaining in Poland is now rare in the private sector, with hardly any sectoral bargaining. During the recession sectoral bargaining further weakened to the point of near extinction in the private sector in Lithuania and Latvia. Gonser (2011) in a review of developments during the current crisis in the three Baltic states, claims that governments have de-legitimized collective bargaining as an institution by walking away from the agreements they had signed as employer. In Slovakia sector agreements used to be fairly widespread, but their number and coverage have declined in recent years, with employers withdrawing from their organizations. Kézdi and Kónya (2011), using an establishment survey, affirm that sector bargaining in the private sector has become rare in Hungary. In the Czech Republic since 2008 fewer <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> stipulate a specific year-on-year wage increase; in 2010 such rate increases were agreed in less than half of all agreements. Even in Slovenia, where multi-employer bargaining is more established, during the recession breaches of the pay guarantees in sectoral agreements soared from 462 reported cases in 2007 to 2, 596 in 2010, followed by a slowing down, or even full stop, of the renewal of agreements.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sectoral</b> <b>collective</b> {{bargaining}} is an aim {{of trade}} unions or labor unions {{to reach a}} <b>collective</b> <b>agreement</b> that covers all workers in a sector of the economy.

30|$|Beyond this, Streeck’s {{investigation}} {{regarding the}} political economy in Germany points to certain institutional arrangements, for instance the vocational education and training system as well as collective bargaining, which not only influence the strategies of companies but also strengthen them. Both mentioned institutions facilitate and support strategies, depending on high-skill and high value production, and thus contribute to succeeding in international markets (Thelen 1999, p.  393). As regards <b>collective</b> <b>agreements,</b> {{it is possible to}} further differentiate between <b>sectoral</b> and occupational <b>collective</b> <b>agreements.</b> While the first takes place at branch level, for instance agreements regulating wages and working time solely for the machinery industry, the latter encompasses specific professions.|$|R

30|$|In fact, a true EPL {{coverage}} {{would take}} into account all possible EPL regimes in a country and weight them by the proportion of workers concerned by such regimes. For example, if <b>sectoral</b> or industrial <b>collective</b> <b>agreements,</b> contractual agreements, or case law set special regimes for different worker categories, {{in addition to the}} general EPL outlined in national legislation, it would be preferable to take them into account. To the extent that existing EPL indicators measuring the level of protection, or costs of dismissals, afforded by EPL (for example, ILO EPLex indicators, or OECD EPL indicators), also reflect mainly laws and general regimes, our coverage data serves as a logical complement to these data.|$|R
30|$|Wage {{policy is}} {{generally}} considered to have facilitated the disinflation process in Slovenia during the transition process and run-up to euro adoption in 2007 (Bole and Mramor 2006; Banerjee and Shi 2010). As noted earlier, adjustments of basic wages to inflation were always partial and the wage indexation formula was weakened from 2001 onward. However, for a complete picture one {{should focus on the}} total gross wage of a worker rather than basic wage, and compare the dynamics of nominal and real total gross wage with that of productivity. The increase in the total gross wage of a worker depends on the increase in basic wage, increases negotiated in <b>sectoral</b> and enterprise-level <b>collective</b> <b>agreements,</b> and other increases based on promotions, individual performance, and enterprise performance. Thus, the growth of total gross wage may exceed inflation. Whether or not this adds to inflationary pressures depends on the trend in the growth of unit labor costs (ULC).|$|R
30|$|Both <b>sectoral</b> and {{occupational}} <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> {{as well as}} the vocational training system and the social security system stabilize the existence of so-called inter-company labor markets, whereas company-sponsored social benefits as well as dismissal protection foster the rise of internal labor markets. Inter-company labor markets constitute central elements for workers and employees and are essential to meet the demand for labor. Nonetheless, {{it is worth noting that}} only few articles within the German literature deal with this phenomenon (Grund 2001, p.  392). The inter-company labor market functions as equivalent for workplace security. For example, occupational labor markets for specific professions combine flexibility and security, since standardized qualifications reduce the transaction costs of firms. That is, the recruitment of workers and employees is incentivized. For those employed, this market offers both entrance and exit possibilities (Krause and Köhler 2012, p.  32). Occupational qualifications, and thus the existence of inter-company labor markets, are closely associated with the German craftsmanship (Köhler et al. 2007, p.  389).|$|R
30|$|Two other possibilities, {{noted by}} Villanueva (2015, p. 9), {{would be to}} make {{extensions}} non-binding once a <b>collective</b> <b>agreement</b> has expired and even to switch to an opt-in system of <b>collective</b> bargaining, whereby <b>sectoral</b> or higher-level bargaining <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> would make provision for non-negotiating and therefore non-signatory firms {{to sign on to}} an agreement ex post after the negotiation. However, the latter recommendation may be criticized as ignoring the point that foreclosing underbidding may be a precondition for <b>sectoral</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining in the first place, returning us to exemption based on ex ante defined criteria (on which more below). For its part, the former recommendation returns us to Exhibit 2. As our description of the Portuguese and Spanish experiences with extension as “unhappy” is meant to imply, one should distinguish between systems with automatic extension and the rest. More specifically, the issue here is the frequency of procedures regulating the “after effects” of <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> beyond their expiration. Such procedures are not the norm.|$|R
30|$|We also test {{additional}} hypotheses regarding institutional {{factors that}} could influence the extent of wage discrimination against foreigners and/or women. The first hypothesis relates {{to the role of}} the collective bargaining regime. We find evidence that firm-level bargaining seems to eliminate the incidence of wage discrimination against foreigners (see Table  4). This lends some support to the often expressed argument that trade unions strive to protect low-wage groups from unfair pay (cf. Dell’Aringa et al. 2004), but also that this protection appears to be only effective at lower levels of bargaining. In Belgium, virtually all firms are covered by national and <b>sectoral</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining <b>agreements,</b> yet only those that engage in additional renegotiation of wages within individual companies—which is the case for around 16.5  % of the firms in our sample—seem to curb wage discrimination against foreigners. The second hypothesis concerns the effect of firm size. Our results (Table  5) suggest that wage discrimination against foreigners is concentrated in relatively large firms. This speaks against the capacity of more sophisticated human resource management practices, according to Lallemand and Rycx (2005) a characteristic of large firms, to attenuate wage discrimination against foreigners. By contrast, our results are in line with the generally observed high wage inequality in big firms. It is also coherent with the explanation that larger firms harbor special low-pay categories in which foreigners are clustered—a practice that was documented in the German manufacturing sector during the first wave of massive post-war immigration (Swenson 1989; Kampelmann 2011) and that could have survived in large firms until today. On any account, the regressions capturing specific institutional contexts corroborate significant and sizable discrimination against women and the absence of significant double discrimination against foreign women.|$|R
40|$|There is no {{widespread}} {{consensus on}} {{what constitutes a}} precarious form of employment. The dividing line between atypical (flexible) and precarious employment is blurred and the analysis shows important differences across sectors in their use, extension, employer perceptions and trade union acceptance. The most important form of precarious employment is temporary, which is the predominant form also in the TAW and construction sectors, but is also important in private hospitals, industrial cleaning and care. The precariousness linked to instability has been reinforced by the extension of long-term unemployment and cuts in unemployment benefits. Part-time employment is strongly linked to low pay, as the industrial cleaning sector shows very clearly. Even though this atypical form of employment is also important in the public hospital sector, it doesn’t translate into precariousness. Part-time is also present in the care sector and private hospitals. Finally, self-employment is characteristic of the private hospital sector, {{but it is not}} associated with precariousness. Peak bipartite social dialogue has made a significant contribution to enhance the regulatory role of collective bargaining, and more specifically, to introduce clauses improving employment security and reducing precariousness. This can be observed in all sectors analyzed, where clauses have been introduced in national-sector <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> in line with recommendations laid down in peak inter-confederal <b>agreements</b> for <b>collective</b> bargaining signed since 1997. In all sectors, the crisis and in particular the 2012 labour market reform has introduced new elements that have increased tensions between social partners, and in some cases, led to a paralysis of collective bargaining, as TAW sector clearly shows. Particularly important in this regard have been the extension of temporary opting out by the employer as well as the limits imposed on the temporary extension of <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> (Ultractividad). The reform has certainly eroded the regulatory and protective capacity of collective bargaining, and has introduced elements dampening workers’ voice. This is a key dimension of precariousness in order to understand future developments. But there are also examples of continued cooperation, even during the crisis and after the 2012 reform. This would be the case of the construction sector, to a large extent explained by a) a shared blaming of the state as both the cause and solution for overcoming the crisis (similarly to what was also observed in the cleaning sector) and b) the institutionalization of social dialogue around a number of bi-partite bodies at sectoral level that do not restrict negotiations and dialogue to the periodical renewal of the <b>collective</b> <b>agreement.</b> The extension of atypical forms of employment, deriving in some cases in precariousness, has been reinforced by the high unemployment rate, but the analysis also shows very different logics across the sectors analyzed. In the case of the cleaning and care sectors, a) an easily replaceable workforce and b) increasing competition between private companies for being awarded public tenders, has led to a downward pressure on labour costs. At the same time, this has triggered a reduction in working time and an extension of low pay. In the case of public hospitals, atypical forms of employment have been introduced as a consequence of public spending cuts, but precariousness remains very limited in scope. In private hospitals, atypical forms of employment are more widespread than in the public sector and derive very often from the need to make compatible a job in the public and the private sectors. In the case of construction, there has not been an extension of atypical forms of employment; both unions and employers acknowledge the intrinsically temporary character of their activity. In this vein, precariousness does not derive directly from temporary employment, but from high unemployment and declining unemployment protection coverage. In some of the sectors analysed, trade unions have prioritized maintaining employment levels over wage increases or maintaining working time. Even though this has contributed in some cases to extend forms of precariousness like low pay, it is a strategy supported by workers provided the high (long-term) unemployment rate. It is also important to remark how in some sectors like construction, trade unions have paid particular attention in their relationship with employers to the unemployed, which goes against the essence of the so-called insider-outsider divide. Few joint initiatives have been developed at sectoral level in recent years in order to improve the position of precarious workers. First, because the emphasis has been placed on maintaining employment levels rather than on improving the conditions of those already employed. Secondly, because another concern, particularly for trade unions, has been to restore social dialogue with employers and manage to re-negotiate <b>sectoral</b> <b>collective</b> <b>agreements.</b> However, there are positive experiences like now the cleaning and care sectors where employers and trade unions have established mechanisms in order for workers to certify the skills acquired and obtain professional certificates...|$|R

30|$|First, various schemes {{allowing}} {{older workers}} to withdraw earlier from {{the labor market}} coexist. The most important one, the collectively agreed (or “conventional”) early-retirement regime, entitles old workers who loose their jobs to UB with an additional allowance paid by the previous employer.

People that benefit from this early retirement scheme are exempted from job search, and pension coverage is continued during that period. The employer has to replace the early retired {{for a period of}} at least three years, although exemptions to this obligation are awarded in 57 % of the cases (OECD 2003, p. 75).

Specific eligibility conditions can also be defined at the <b>sectoral</b> level by <b>collective</b> <b>agreements.</b> There is also an “unofficial early retirement scheme.” As in the collectively agreed pre-retirement regime, the employer who lays off a worker under this scheme pays a supplement to UB.
