40|$|Whole-body {{vibration}} describes vibrations {{that are}} transferred from a supporting surface {{to the human}} body. Low back injury is a major health issue amongst heavy machine operators and <b>seat</b> <b>selection</b> is important for reducing vibration exposure. Modeling the vibration attenuation properties of seats is one approach for predicting the performance of seats in different vibration environments. An efficient neural network (NN) algorithm identified the vibration attenuation properties of five suspension seats that are commonly used in the Northern Ontario mining sector. Each of the NN seat models strongly predicted vertical seatpan r. m. s. accelerations from the chassis accelerations and a measure of driver anthropometrics. We implemented the developed NN models to evaluate the performance of industrial seats {{for a variety of}} skidders from the forestry sector and load-haul-dump vehicles from the underground mining environment. Our results demonstrated that <b>seat</b> <b>selection</b> is not universal. The performance and rank orders of industrial seats varied between vibration environments based on the calculated equivalent daily exposure (A(8)) values. We performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of specific vibration frequency components on the predicted daily exposure values. This analysis revealed that each of the industrial seats responded differently to specific vibration frequencies and explained why the <b>seat</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm matched particular seats to specific vibration environments. We also evaluated the performance of the new No-JoltTM air-inflated cushion with multi-axis vibration exposures and vertical jolt exposures. The vibration attenuation properties were assessed for two seat suspensions (with relatively good and poor initial performance) when their foam cushions were replaced with the air-inflated cushion. The air cushion only improved the vibration attenuation properties of the seat that initially had good performance. We also observed that operator’s anthropometrics and sex influenced the performance of the air-inflated cushion in certain cases when vibration environment includes jolt exposures. All of our findings emphasize the importance of matching the specific seat/cushion to the particular vibration environment in order to reduce heavy machine operators’ vibration exposure and minimize their health risks...|$|E

Additionally, the previous research in aircraft seating was unable to dissociate a bias {{to one side of the}} screen from a bias to one side of the cabin of the aircraft. Here we present a study in which participants were asked to select seats for a range of fictional flights. They demonstrated a preference for seats on the right of the cabin, irrespective of whether the right of the cabin appeared to either the right or the left of the screen, a preference for seats towards the front of the aircraft and a preference to favour window and aisle seats. This suggests, in contrast to previous research, that participants demonstrated a rightward lateral bias to representations of an aircraft.

40|$|Background: The <b>seat</b> <b>selection</b> and {{classroom}} dynamics may have mutual {{influence on the}} student performance and participation in both assigned and random seating arrangement. Purpose: The aim {{of the study was}} to understand the influence of <b>seat</b> <b>selection</b> on educational achievement. Methods: The seating positions of the medical students were recorded on an architectural plan during each class session and the means and standard deviations of the students&#x 2019; locations were calculated in X and Y orientations. The locations of the students in the class were analyzed based on three architectural classifications: interactional zone, distance from the board, and access to the aisles. Final exam scores were used to measure the students&#x 2019; educational achievement. Results: Our results demonstrate that there is a statistically significant relationship between the student&#x 0027;s locations in the class and their attendance and educational achievements. Conclusion: Two factors may effect on educational achievement: student seating in the high interactional zone and minimal changes in seating location. Seating in the high interaction zone was directly associated with higher performance and inversely correlated with the percentage of absences. This observation is consistent with the view that students in the front of the classroom are likely more motivated and interact with the lecturer more than their classmates...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Correlational {{research shows that}} belief in a continuum of psychiatric problems predicts decreased public stigma. However, the correlational findings fail to inform the stigma reduction prospects of manipulating continuum beliefs. All extant experimental work has been executed online. This study examined effects of a laboratory-based continuum intervention on behavioral and self-report measures of psychiatric stigma. Methods Sixty-nine undergraduates believed that they would meet a man with schizophrenia. They then read a bogus scientific article that attested to a categorical view of schizophrenia, a continuum view, or that merely described schizophrenia. Some participants then completed a task that required reflection on their differences from (categorical group) or similarities to (continuum group) the man with schizophrenia. Participants eventually moved to an adjacent room and sat in one of several seats that varied in their proximity to a seat ostensibly occupied by the man with schizophrenia. Results The continuum intervention decreased self-reported social distance and the categorical intervention increased endorsement of damaging stereotypes. <b>Seat</b> <b>selection</b> was unaffected by our manipulation, but we obtained evidence of significant links to validated stigma measures. Limitations Our sample was small, and our behavioral stigma measure could be modified to maximize variability in participants 2 ̆ 7 <b>seat</b> <b>selection.</b> Conclusions The study offers modest support of the stigma reduction effect of continuum belief intervention.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} an {{investigation}} into the specification and use of appropriate seating systems to reduce whole-body vibration (WBV) exposure in typical vehicles used in the SA mining industry. The EU Directive EU/ 44 / 2002 to be legislated in 2005 in European countries, provides legal and economic motivation for this project. The criteria for <b>seat</b> <b>selection</b> can be condensed to the requirements in the directive, which mandates an action level of 0. 5 m/s 2 and a vibration exposure limit of 1. 15 m/s 2 for an equivalent 8 -hour daily exposure period. As part of this study six suspension seats, which the manufacturers claim satisfy the requirements in ISO 70966, were tested to determine the most suitable seat for an articulated dump truck. Six test subjects, three 'light' and three 'heavy' as specified in ISO 70966, were used to estimate the seat transmissibility functions in the vertical direction of the six different suspension seats. Transmissibility functions were measured in the laboratory with two excitation levels of 1 m/s 2 and 2 m/s 2 r. m. s. in the 0. 5 - 30 Hz frequency range, as well as one spectrum approximating the EM 5 spectral class. SEAT values were calculated for road vibration data measured on a typical articulated dump truck. A set of <b>seat</b> <b>selection</b> guidelines that can be followed by vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, procurement officers and and the technical staff on a mine is proposed in this article. It is recommended that additional studies of the use and operating conditions of seating systems in the SA industry, as well as an epidemiological survey be commissioned to gather additional information on this subject. © The South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 2005.

In order to cope with the challenges the petroleum industry is faced with in deepwater exploration today, a Marine Riserless Drilling Joint Industry Project, MRDJIP, was formed. The main task for this project is to develop the technology neede to drill in water depths beyond 7500 feet - the practical limit of current floating drilling units. As a part of this project the members of the MRDJIP wanted to investigate the peak gas outflow rate when circulating a kick out through the return line(s). They found it important to know whether it is necessary to redesign the mud/gas separators already existing. In this thesis different cases affecting the peak gas outflow rate are discussed and suggestions on how to reduce the peak gas outflow rate are discussed and suggestions on how to reduce the peak gas outflow rates are purposed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{discussion}} of improvements Chinese Low-cost Carriers (LCCs) could make {{in order to become}} profitable and successful as their counterparts in Europe and the United States. China is Asia's latest LCC market and has accelerated its pace in developing LCCs since Chinese authorities published the "Guidance on Promoting the Development of Low-Cost Airlines" at the end of 2013. There are currently seven LCCs in China, including Spring Airlines, an established LCC since 2004 along with another six newly established LCCs in response to the published Guidance. The newly established six have followed many practices adopted by Spring Airlines, which is seen as a role model for the Chinese LCC market. Spring Airlines applies sound management practices to control its costs, producing good profitability. As the Guidance is implemented by Chinese authorities in next few years, many costs that were previously uncontrolled, such as aircraft ownership, crew and airport fees, could be further cut. While expecting positive news from civil authorities, Spring Airlines and other Chinese LCCs could begin work on improvements. From the perspective of cost control, Spring Airlines could reduce its labor costs by decreasing employee-to-aircraft ratio. In terms of increasing revenue, Spring Airlines could increase charges on excess baggage and <b>seat</b> <b>selection.</b> It could also expand into various other ancillary services, such as in-flight wifi, to increase revenues. by Yu Zhan.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{discussed}} that auditory and visual sensations, {{in terms of the}} temporal and spatial factors, are associated with {{the left and the right}} human cerebral hemispheres, respectively (Ando, Auditory and Visual Sensations, to be published). The purpose of this paper is to apply this type of concept to general environmental design. An approach is made here, emphasizing the temporal design in architecture and in the environment. All healthy ideas, creations, and discoveries that have contributed to human life for thousands of years, have been based on the unique personality of the individual. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the environment be designed for three parallel stages of time, 1. the time of body, 2. the time of mind, and 3. the time of creation based on a unique personality. A well-designed environment would be a meeting place for the arts and sciences associated with both hemispheres, and in turn, might help further the discovery of the individual’s personality as a minimum unit of society. A typical example can be seen in the Kirishima International Music Hall, which opened in 1994. The acoustic design together with the <b>seat</b> <b>selection</b> system is made to the subjective preference judgments of each individual [Ando, Architectural Acoustics, Blending Sound Sources, Sound Fields, and Listeners, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1998]. Similarly, to develop a healthy personality in children, temporal and spatial design should be considered in their environment because such an environment is an essential element for the development of the brain through the temporal and spatial information it receives. To activate both cerebral hemispheres for finding individual personality, a creative working space (CWS) in the home plays an important role [Bosworth and Ando, Journal of Temporal Design in Architecture and the Environment, 6, 18 - 25, 2006].

40|$|The study {{described}} in this report attempted to describe some high school classrooms in terms of such physical features as lighting, acoustics, thermal comfort, furniture design and spatial arrangements. It also sought to explore the possible associations between student seating preference and such "ecological features". The study first tried to confirm some previous research findings {{with regard to the}} existence of "zones of participation", associated with student personality traits including academic ability. The researcher then explored whether the "physical conditions" prevalent in classrooms were as much the determinants of student seating choice, as much as the student's personality traits and relationships with his peers and teachers. It further sought to confirm whether <b>seat</b> <b>selection</b> was consistent and to explore whether it was characterised by a range of factors which could be identified and classified. The study lastly aimed to obtain anecdotal data about the students' perceptions of their classroom environments. Information was obtained from one thousand and eighty-six completed questionnaires from students in years seven to ten, in two different types of classroom, in two separate high schools in the Australian Capital Territory. The results in general supported previous findings regarding associations between central and peripheral seating locations and a student's personality traits and academic achievement level. The results, furthermore, suggested some possible dependence upon the classroom's dimensions and opportunity for teacherstudent eye contact as a crucial factor in the relationship between seating location and student achievement level. The data further confirmed that a number of physical as well as social factors were determinants of a student's choice of seat. These factors were found to be consistently identifiable over various age groups, in different kinds of classroom, in different subject areas and between separate schools. The anecdotal data further established the degree of concern and importance attributed to the physical environment by the students...|$|E
40|$|Crowding is {{identified}} both internationally and in New Zealand {{as a key}} issue in public transport. Unfortunately, the concerns of public transport providers are focussed on economic imperative rather than {{a concern for the}} actual experiences of patrons. The social needs of public transport passengers are neglected, both in practice and in research. This research examines the delicate balance between the need for privacy and the need for social interaction in the setting of public transport. These needs are examined through naturalistic observation of 1703 passengers' behaviours, such as <b>seat</b> <b>selection,</b> activity use, and conversation on buses and trains. This was followed by a survey-based Exploratory study examining a range of individual difference variables. Based on the findings of this Exploratory study measures were identified for use in a series of subsequent surveys of public and private transport users. Specifically, questionnaires measuring the attitudes and self-reported behaviour of train (N = 319), car (N = 305) and bus commuters (N = 216). Results suggest that the seating layout of public transport forces people into an intimate distance with strangers, causing social discomfort. Hall's (1966) proxemic theory suggests that these intimate distances are typically reserved for people with closer relations. People compensate by adapting to this close yet impersonal social situation. There is evidence that interactive strategies such as talking and positive body language with other passengers reduces the level of social discomfort, whereas defensive strategies do not reduce discomfort, but do form a negative relationship with social interaction which helps perpetuate a socially stagnant atmosphere. Discomfort from close interpersonal distance and less positive attitudes towards other passengers, while not as important as instrumental variables (such as longer trip durations), are still potential barriers to public transport patronage and should be given greater attention. In conclusion, interactive behaviours are determined to be necessary to reduce social discomfort in public transport. Festinger and colleague's (1950) passive contact theory (PCT) is interrupted in the public transport setting, and it is posited that pro-social behaviours, such as smiling, and acknowledging other passengers with greetings are a precondition for successful interpersonal interaction...|$|E
