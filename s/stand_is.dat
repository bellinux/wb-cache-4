The rear of the south end of the stand houses away supporters. The north corner of the <b>stand</b> <b>is</b> {{connected}} to the Gwladys Street Stand. The current capacity of the <b>stand</b> <b>is</b> 10,546. The stand takes its name from the adjacent Bullens Road. The Upper Bullens is decorated with Archibald Leitch's distinctive truss design.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the main <b>stand</b> <b>is</b> {{very similar to the}} one at Springfield Park, former home of Wigan Athletic. This was also built in 1953.|$|E

50|$|The north (with a {{capacity}} of 4,000 seated) and south (6,000 standing) <b>stands</b> <b>were</b> covered; the west and east <b>stands</b> <b>were</b> uncovered terraces. The east <b>stand</b> <b>was</b> reserved for away supporters, as was a small section of the north stand.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Originally {{only the}} lower <b>stands</b> <b>were</b> built but {{in later years}} the upper <b>stands</b> <b>were</b> added.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930's the North <b>Stand</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt and was {{extended}} along {{the full length}} of the pitch to become the largest stand in Fratton Park. The upper North <b>Stand</b> <b>was</b> roofed and contained wooden seating. The lower North <b>Stand</b> <b>was</b> left open as terracing.|$|R
5|$|Built in 2000, {{the main}} Trinity Road <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> the most {{recently}} completed at Villa Park and houses the dressing rooms, club offices and director's boxes. The <b>stand</b> <b>is</b> composed of three tiers with {{a row of}} executive boxes between {{the second and third}} tiers. Although much larger than the other stands, the stand has roughly the same roof level as the other three sides. The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match {{are in the middle of}} the stand at pitch level. The press and the directors' VIP area are situated in the centre of the middle tier. The upper tiers of the stand extend over Trinity Road, the street that cuts behind the ground. Trinity Road passes through a tunnel formed by the Trinity Road Stand.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{during the}} Second World War, the Gwladys Street Stand {{suffered}} bomb damage. The bomb had landed directly in Gwladys Street and caused serious injury to nearby residents. The bomb splinter {{damage to the}} bricks on the <b>stand</b> <b>is</b> still noticeable. The cost of repair was £5,000 and was {{paid for by the}} War Damage Commission.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the stands}} have more {{traditional}} names, but {{have since been}} renamed because of sponsorship deals. The JCT600 <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> the ground's main stand, and is often called the latter by fans, but {{is also known as}} the Sunwin stand owing to the former sponsor. The Kop, was the former standing area, and its name was derived, like at many stadia across the country, from the Battle of Spion Kop. The East Stand, sponsored by Northern Commercials, is also named the Midland Road stand, because of the road {{on that side of the}} ground. The TL Dallas <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> also known as the Bradford end, because it is nearest to the city centre.|$|E
50|$|The main West <b>Stand</b> <b>was</b> largely {{built in}} 1958 and {{consisted}} of seating and terraces. The South <b>Stand</b> <b>was</b> originally built in 1949 and served family spectators. The North <b>Stand</b> <b>was</b> built in 1984 and consisted solely of terraces. The East <b>Stand</b> <b>was</b> formed of uncovered terraces. Floodlights were first installed in 1961.The ground also hosted football games for the 1948 Olympic Games, {{one of only two}} grounds outside London (the other being Fratton Park).|$|R
5000|$|In 1947 {{the north}} <b>stands</b> <b>were</b> added and the stadium was renamed Skelly Stadium. In 1965, the track was removed, {{the field was}} lowered, the west <b>stands</b> <b>were</b> {{expanded}} and the south <b>stands</b> <b>were</b> added, bringing the total capacity to 40,385 seats. In February 2005, the north <b>stands</b> <b>were</b> demolished {{to make way for}} the new Case Athletic Complex, reducing the seating capacity to 35,542. In 2007-2008, the stadium was renovated, reducing capacity to 30,000 ...|$|R
50|$|The north <b>stand</b> <b>was</b> {{the only}} <b>stand,</b> not to <b>be</b> renovated in the 2006 rebuild, but in 2012 Randers FC {{announced}} that the North <b>Stand</b> would <b>be</b> renovated. The North <b>Stand</b> would <b>be</b> finished in {{the start of the}} season 2013-14. The North <b>Stand</b> <b>was</b> designed by Friis & Moltke, while Grontmij was the consultative engineers and Einar Kornerup contractor.|$|R
5|$|Opposite the Sir Alex Ferguson <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, {{formerly}} Old Trafford's {{main stand}} and previously {{known as the}} South Stand. Although only a single-tiered stand, the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand contains most of the ground's executive suites, and also plays host to any VIPs who may come to watch the match. Members of the media are seated {{in the middle of}} the Upper South Stand to give them the best view of the match. The television gantry is also in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, so the Sir Bobby Charlton <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> the one that gets shown on television least often. Television studios are located at either end of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, with the club's in-house television station, MUTV, in the East studio and other television stations, such as the BBC and Sky, in the West studio.|$|E
5|$|The 10,356 {{capacity}} all-seater {{stadium is}} in the Bury Park area of Luton, and named after the road that runs along one end of it, although the official address of the club is 1 Maple Road. Opposite the eponymous Kenilworth <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> the Oak Road End, which has evolved from a stand first used exclusively by Luton supporters, then later by away supporters, and now used by both except in times of high ticket demand from away clubs. The Main <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> flanked by the David Preece Stand, and opposite them stands a row of executive boxes. These boxes replaced the Bobbers Stand in 1986, as the club sought to maximise income.|$|E
5|$|The Jimmy McIlroy <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> {{situated}} at {{the eastern side of}} the pitch and has a current capacity of 6,088. The upper tier of the <b>stand</b> <b>is</b> the designated family area at Turf Moor and like the James Hargreaves Stand, it has a number of corporate hospitality boxes. The Bob Lord Stand, which has a capacity of 3,036 fans, runs parallel with Harry Potts Way and houses the executive lounges as well as the Burnley Football Club trophy room. The stand was built in 1974 and was paid for in part by the sale of Martin Dobson to Everton. Named after Bob Lord, the former chairman of Burnley, the stand cost £480,000 was opened by Edward Heath, the Conservative Party leader at the time, a Burnley supporter, who had just been defeated as prime minister by Labour's Harold Wilson.|$|E
50|$|In 1981 {{reconstruction}} {{works were}} done on arena, west <b>stand</b> <b>was</b> roofed, east <b>stand</b> <b>was</b> constructed, after these works {{capacity of the}} Stadium increased to 8,000 seats.|$|R
50|$|The {{field was}} {{transformed}} for the Greenville Majors {{after their first}} year of existence. In 1947, the football <b>stands</b> <b>were</b> removed and the <b>stands</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt to accommodate baseball.|$|R
50|$|It {{is planned}} to have 50,401 seats initially, with {{potential}} to increase to 60,000 at a later date. The club's current stadium has been all-seater (with a capacity of just over 40,000) since 1994, when a new <b>stand</b> <b>was</b> built {{at one end of}} the ground. The Main <b>Stand</b> <b>was</b> built in 1970, while the two remaining <b>stands</b> <b>are</b> refurbished interwar structures.|$|R
5|$|The North <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> {{the oldest}} {{part of the}} venue and is owned by Aspmyra AS. For {{sponsorship}} reasons, it is named after Nordlandsbanken. The area behind the East Stand was bought by Bodø Boligbyggelag, who built housing there and is named after Toyota, again for sponsorship reasons. In 2010, the operating costs of the venue were NOK2 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground is}} made up of five stands—opposite the eponymous Kenilworth <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> the Oak Road End, and to the left is the Main Stand, which is flanked to its right by the David Preece Stand. Opposite them stand a row of {{executive}} boxes.|$|E
5|$|The venue {{is located}} in the {{southern}} part of the town center of Bodø, on Hålogalandsgata, close to Bodø Airport. The venue has a capacity for 7,354 spectators. The South Stand has 15 luxury boxes, each with seating for 12 people, and club seating for an additional 100 people in Aspmyra Sportsbar; this is only available for corporate sponsors. Both the sports bar and the boxes have access to dinners before the match. The <b>stand</b> <b>is</b> combined with a commercial and residential building, which is owned by Aspmyra Næringsbygg, which is again controlled by Gunvald Johansen. Bodø/Glimt's offices are located in this section, which along with the public access is rented by Glimt. Of sponsorship reasons, the South <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> named for Diadora.|$|E
50|$|The latest {{construction}} work {{took place between}} 2004 and 2006. The south and north <b>stand</b> <b>were</b> renovated, with two tiers (lower tier and upper tier). On both sides, {{the capacity of the}} lower tier is 1,000 seats, and the capacity of upper tier <b>is</b> 2,500. Both <b>stands</b> <b>are</b> all-seater with roofs. During the last reconstruction, a new east <b>stand</b> <b>was</b> built.|$|R
5|$|Easter Road is an all-seated stadium, {{split into}} four {{geographic}} sections, {{known as the}} Famous Five (formerly North), East, South and West Stands. The Famous Five and South <b>Stands</b> <b>are</b> the oldest part of the present stadium, built in 1995. Each stand has two tiers, a cantilevered roof and a capacity of nearly 4,000. To keep {{within the boundaries of}} the site, the upper deck of each stand angles toward the centre. When the <b>stands</b> <b>were</b> built, the Famous Five <b>Stand</b> <b>was</b> above pitch level and the South <b>Stand</b> <b>was</b> below, but this was corrected when the natural slope <b>was</b> removed. Each <b>stand</b> also stretched beyond the east touchline, which was corrected by widening the pitch when the East <b>Stand</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt. Between the two tiers of the Famous Five <b>Stand</b> there <b>are</b> function suites and lounges. Before the <b>stands</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt in the 1990s, the north and south ends of Easter Road were known as the Cowshed and Dunbar End respectively. The southern end was called the Dunbar End because there was a lemonade factory named Dunbar's located behind it.|$|R
50|$|After {{the breakup}} of SFR Yugoslavia, the stadium {{underwent}} additional construction work. The east <b>stand</b> <b>was</b> torn down, and a new north <b>stand</b> <b>was</b> built. Capacity was reduced to 12,000.|$|R
5|$|To {{the right}} of the Main <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> the 3,229-seater Kenilworth Stand, which backs onto Kenilworth Road. The Club Shop is behind this stand, which was once an open terrace but is now a roofed all-seater stand. In the corner between the Kenilworth Stand and the boxes is the stadium clock.|$|E
5|$|At both Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors matches, away {{supporters}} are {{situated in the}} North Stand behind the goal. Occasionally, during rugby games which attract low away support, the 5,418 capacity North <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> closed altogether, and the away fans who attend are put into an alternative stand. The eastern stand, known as 'The Boston Stand', and the western 'Springfield Stand' run across the longer sides of the pitch. The Boston <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> the largest, capable of seating up to 8,238 fans and holding an electronic scoreboard. The Springfield Stand contains the stadium's vital facilities; four dressing rooms, benches, a doping control room and a treatment room for the players, as well as four executive boxes, ten radio commentary points and a designated TV studio, in addition to holding 6,100 fans. The North Stand and South Stand have a seating capacity of 5,418 and 5,412 respectively. The stadium also has facilities and access for up to 278 fans with disabilities, with facilities for partially sighted fans. The seats are a mixture of both resident teams' main colours — cherry red and blue. The stadium is fully compliant with safety guidelines for a sports ground.|$|E
5|$|Dunbeth hill {{where the}} present local {{authority}} municipal buildings <b>stand</b> <b>is</b> {{a wedge of}} rock which was probably squeezed upwards {{by the force of}} two (now-extinct) fault lines. There are the remains of spreads of glacial sands along the crest of Drumpellier, the west bank of Gartsherrie Burn and along modern day Bank Street. Kirkwood, Kirkshaws and Shawhead sit on a sandstone capped ridge looking south over the Clyde Valley. The vital Coatbridge black band coal field extended from Langloan to beyond {{the eastern edge of the}} town.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, {{reconstruction}} {{work was done}} on the arena; the west <b>stand</b> <b>was</b> roofed and the east <b>stand</b> <b>was</b> constructed. After these works capacity of the stadium increased to 8000 seats.|$|R
5000|$|His cymbal <b>stands</b> <b>were</b> the Ludwig Hercules <b>stands</b> (that <b>were</b> {{specially}} manufactured for Tucker by Ludwig).|$|R
50|$|In Mexico, taco <b>stands</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} referred to as taquerías, because originally a taquería was typically a street vendor. However, many taquerías today are restaurants located in buildings. Taco <b>stands</b> may <b>be</b> located at roadsides and in areas where people gather, such as at outdoor mall areas. Taco <b>stands</b> <b>are</b> typically located outdoors, although the term is also used at times to refer to taco restaurants. Some taco <b>stands</b> <b>are</b> temporary operations, set-up for events such as fairs and festivals.|$|R
5|$|Opposite the Bill Struth Main <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> the Sandy Jardine Stand {{formerly}} known as the Govan Stand. It is a two-tier stand, similar in style to the two end stands, which was completed in 1981. To the rear of the Govan <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> the Argyle House extension, completed in 1990, which provides executive boxes, hospitality areas and office space. The Bar 72 area was added to the rear section of the Govan Stand in 2006. The Copland Road Stand, at the east end of the stadium, was completed in 1979 and now accommodates just over 8,000 fans. It is traditionally the 'Rangers end' of the ground and the team normally chooses to attack that end {{in the second half of}} matches. The western Broomloan Road Stand, which was completed in 1980, is identical to the opposite end. Although constructed as separate structures, the three stands have been linked since the mid-1990s, when two additional areas of seating were added to the corner areas. All of the stands are designed using the 'goalpost' structure, in which a large portal frame supports perpendicular beams on which roof cladding is secured. A Rangers Megastore is located in the corner between the Copland Road and Govan Stands.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Western Wall came under Israeli control in 1967, a tefillin stand was erected with {{permission}} from Rabbi Yehuda Meir Getz, the first rabbi of the Kotel. The stand offers visitors the chance to put on Tefillin, a daily Jewish ritual. In the months following the Six-Day War an estimated 400,000 Jews observed this ritual at the stand. The <b>stand</b> <b>is</b> staffed by multilingual volunteers and an estimated 100,000 visitors put on tefillin there annually.|$|E
5|$|The Kenny Dalglish <b>Stand</b> <b>is</b> a two-tiered stand. Originally a single-tiered stand {{called the}} Kemlyn Road Stand, the second tier was added in 1992 to {{coincide}} with the club's centenary. It is located opposite the Main Stand and houses directors' boxes, which are between the two tiers. The stand also houses the ground's police station. On 3 May 2017, Liverpool announced the Centenary Stand would be renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand in honour of the club's greatest servant, former player and manager Kenny Dalglish.|$|E
50|$|Musicians {{may also}} have {{expensive}} non-folding stands in their homes or music studios made of wood or metal. These <b>stands</b> <b>are</b> not designs that {{are meant to be}} relocated. Due to their weight and/or their delicate finishes, they are intended to be used in a single location, such as a private home. Some heavy <b>stands</b> <b>are</b> made of carved wood and feature bas relief carvings and inlay work. Other heavy <b>stands</b> <b>are</b> made of brass, and feature musical motifs such as treble clefs. Some of these heavy <b>stands</b> <b>are</b> objects of art in their own right.|$|R
50|$|In 1920, {{the seats}} in the north <b>stand</b> <b>were</b> upholstered. At the same time, the {{railings}} on the south <b>stand</b> <b>were</b> moved forward 3 yd to allow a further 2,500 spectators in the ground.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Stands</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} {{located at}} high-traffic locations such as airports, hotel driveways, railway stations, subway stations, bus depots, ferry terminals, shopping centres, and major street intersections. Usually <b>stands</b> <b>are</b> marked by simple painted signs.|$|R
