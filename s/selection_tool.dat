2500|$|... main tools {{include a}} pen, an eraser, and a paintbrush. New to Flipnotes Studio 3D are tools that draw shapes, fill {{enclosed}} areas (paint bucket), and insert text. The application features a limited color palette, including black, white, red, blue, green, and yellow. This {{is a slight}} improvement upon Flipnote Studio, which didn't include yellow and green as selectable colors, but were still possible using color mixing. The <b>selection</b> <b>tool</b> is used to copy and manipulate parts of a frame. Users can also use the 3DS system's camera and microphone to add audio and photos to their creations. These animations can either be shared on the application's native online community, or by exporting them as GIF or AVI files.|$|E
2500|$|GIMP {{selection}} tools {{include a}} rectangular and circular <b>selection</b> <b>tool,</b> free select tool, and fuzzy select tool (also known as magic wand). More advanced selection tools include the select by color tool for selecting contiguous regions of color—and the scissors select tool, which creates selections semi-automatically between areas of highly contrasting colors. GIMP also supports a quick mask mode where a user {{can use a}} brush to paint the area of a selection. [...] Visibly {{this looks like a}} red colored overlay being added or removed. The foreground select tool is an implementation of Simple Interactive Object Extraction (SIOX) a method used to perform the extraction of foreground elements, such as a person or a tree in focus. The Paths Tool allows a user to create vectors (also known as Bézier curves). Users can use paths to create complex selections, including around natural curves. They can paint (or [...] "stroke") the paths with brushes, patterns, or various line styles. Users can name and save paths for reuse.|$|E

50|$|First, SAI {{includes}} several tools {{for creating a}} selection, but only the rectangular (rubber band) <b>selection</b> <b>tool</b> shows the transformation options. But {{it does not matter}} how a selection is initially created, selecting the rectangular <b>selection</b> <b>tool</b> will then show the transformation options which will work fine with it. Effectively the 'rectangular selection' tool button (a dotted rectangle in the tool palette) is also the 'make transform tools visible' tool button.|$|E

The border of a selected area in an image is often animated with the marching ants effect to help the user to distinguish the selection border from the image background.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the use of <b>selection</b> <b>tools</b> in New Zealand secondary schools, specifically which <b>selection</b> <b>tools</b> are used, how satisfactory the tools are, and which criteria secondary school librarians use in assessing <b>selection</b> <b>tools.</b> Particular attention was paid to the status of evaluative and alerting <b>selection</b> <b>tools</b> in school libraries. A mail questionnaire was sent to a random nationwide sample of 186 secondary school librarians. To gain a richer understanding of the context of selection in secondary schools, 4 focus groups were also held in the Wellington, Horowhenua, Palmerston North, and Wanganui areas. The resulting data was analysed alongside the questionnaire data to provide more comprehensive answers to the study's research questions. The study found that alerting tools were more widely used and considered more valuable than evaluative tools, with the ability to preview an item a key concern for school librarians. Tools supplied by the book selling and publishing industries were the most common tools used, and the features of <b>selection</b> <b>tools</b> considered most important focused on a tool's performance as an alerting tool. Online tools were not widely used, with connectivity problems and lack of time cited as the most common reasons...|$|R

50|$|Development and {{implementation}} of such screening methods is sometimes done by human resources departments; larger organizations hire consultants or firms that specialize in developing personnel selection systems. I-O psychologists must evaluate evidence regarding {{the extent to which}} <b>selection</b> <b>tools</b> predict job performance, evidence that bears on the validity of <b>selection</b> <b>tools.</b> These procedures are usually validated (shown to be job relevant), using {{one or more of the}} following types of validity: content validity, construct validity, and/or criterion-related validity.|$|R
25|$|Personnel {{selection}} is the systematic process of hiring and promoting personnel. Personnel selection systems employ evidence-based practices {{to determine the}} most qualified candidates. Personnel selection involves both the newly hired and individuals who can be promoted from within the organization. Common <b>selection</b> <b>tools</b> include ability tests (e.g., cognitive, physical, or psycho-motor), knowledge tests, personality tests, structured interviews, the systematic collection of biographical data, and work samples.

5000|$|The quick <b>selection</b> <b>tool</b> selects areas {{based on}} edges, {{similarly}} to the magnetic lasso tool. The {{difference between this}} tool and the lasso tool {{is that there is}} no starting and ending point. Since there isn’t a starting and ending point, the selected area can be added onto as much as possible without starting over. By dragging the cursor over the desired area, the quick <b>selection</b> <b>tool</b> detects the edges of the image. The [...] "marching ants" [...] allow the user to know what is currently being selected. Once the user is done, the selected area can be edited without affecting the rest of the image. One of the features that makes this tool especially user friendly is that the SHIFT key is not needed to add more to the selection; by default, extra mouse clicks will be added to the selection rather than creating a new selection.|$|E

40|$|In {{computer-based}} {{open learning}} environments {{students have the}} availability to control the <b>selection</b> of <b>tools</b> {{in order to support}} learning. However, learner-controlled <b>tool</b> <b>selection</b> is often suboptimal or even non-existent, which may be due to low or no perceived functionality of tools or to the type of achievement goals that a learner has set. This study highlights the importance of advice as a way to make students instructionally knowledgeable about the functionality of support tools and hence to promote students’ <b>tool</b> <b>selection.</b> Consequently, it is suggested that more optimal <b>tool</b> <b>selection</b> is reflected in higher motivation and higher learning gains. For this study, a computer-based learning environment was used and students were assigned to one of three conditions: (1) no advice on <b>tool</b> <b>selection,</b> (2) cognitive advice on <b>tool</b> <b>selection</b> and (3) affective advice on <b>tool</b> <b>selection.</b> Results indicate that both advice and students’ goals affect the perceived functionality of tools but that a higher perceived functionality is not reflected in intensified <b>tool</b> <b>selection.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

Once a selection is created, further changes to the image will be confined to that area.

In this paper we propose a model for index selection based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP). The ILP formulation enables a wealth of combinatorial optimization techniques for providing quality guarantees, approximate solutions and even for computing optimal solutions. We present a system architecture for ILP-based index selection, in the context of commercial database systems. Our ILP-based approach offers higher solution quality, efficiency and scalability without sacrificing any of the precision offered by existing index <b>selection</b> <b>tools.</b> 1...|$|R
