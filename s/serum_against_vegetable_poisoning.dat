60|$|We thus {{see that}} not only do {{those parts of the}} skin which bear white hair differ in a {{remarkable}} manner from those bearing hair of any other colour, but that some great constitutional difference must be correlated with the colour of the hair; for in the above-mentioned cases, <b>vegetable</b> <b>poisons</b> caused fever, swelling of the head, as well as other symptoms, and even death, to all the white, or white-spotted animals.|$|R
50|$|One such {{method to}} find out if {{witchcraft}} is being used is the so-called poison oracle; this uses a <b>vegetable</b> <b>poison</b> called benge, which is fed to a chicken.

In order for the first test to be accepted as solid evidence, the results of the second test must be opposite of the first.|$|R
60|$|Various facts, which I have {{elsewhere}} given, {{prove that}} the colour of the skin and hair is sometimes correlated in a surprising manner with a complete immunity from the action of certain <b>vegetable</b> <b>poisons</b> and from the attacks of certain parasites.

40|$|An {{enterotoxin}} {{with the}} ability to induce fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loops, erythema in the skin of guinea pigs, and lethality in mice appears in cell extracts (CE) and culture filtrates (CF) of sporulating cells of some Clostridium perfringens type A strains. All activities in CE and CF were eluted simultaneously from a Sephadex G- 200 column. Different elution patterns were obtained for these activities present in CE and CF. Rabbit immune <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> CF and the active CE fractions eliminated the three biological activities in CE and CF. These activities present in CF and CE were not eliminated by any of the known antitoxins present in diagnostic <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> C. perfringens types A, B, C, D, and E. Immunodiffusion studies with immune <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> active CE fractions and CF indicated a precipitin line of identity between CF and CE of NCTC 8798 and other enterotoxin-positive strains but not enterotoxin-negative strains. Disc electrophoresis of active G- 200 fractions on 7. 0 % polyacrylamide gels revealed a single area containing erythemal activity and mouse lethality. Immunodiffusion with acrylamide gels, containing crude fractionated enterotoxin, and immune <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> partially purified enterotoxin revealed a single precipitin band in the same area as the biological activities. Immunoelectrophoresis of CE of enterotoxin-positive and enterotoxin-negative strains also showed one precipitin band which occurred only with enterotoxin-positive strains. These findings suggest that one component is responsible for the biological activities attributed to the enterotoxin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the fourth part of a comprehensive programme undertaken by the WHO International Reference Centre for Enteroviruses and other laboratories for the testing of enterovirus equine antisera prepared for long-term use as reference antisera. The studies were designed to appraise the specificity of the immune serum of horses inoculated with prototype enteroviruses (coxsackievirus types A 2, 4, 8, 10, 11, 14 - 16, 18 - 21, and 24, and echoviruses E 21, 27, 30, 31, and 33). Tests for neutralizing antibody were performed against the homologous viruses and against available regional homotypic strains. Heterotypic tests were performed against reoviruses 1 - 3, adenoviruses 1 - 31, and the entire series of enteroviruses (with the exception of enterovirus 68). The homologous geometric mean titre of the 5 echovirus antisera ranged from 3 000 to 10 000; the titre of 1 coxsackievirus antiserum (A 24) was only about 400, but the titres of the others ranged from 1 500 to 14 000. All corresponding preinoculation sera were negative. Heterotypic antibody of significant titre was found in 4 antisera: E 31 <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> E 5 virus, CA 8 <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> CA 3 virus, CA 13 <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> CA 18 virus, and CA 15 <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> CA 2 virus.

40|$|The fusion {{glycoprotein}} (F protein) of paramyxoviruses plays a {{vital role}} in virus-induced cytopathology. To explore the role of the F protein in peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) - induced cytopathology, the F protein of PPRV was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. The purified F protein, when incubated with chicken erythrocytes, caused lysis suggesting that PPRV F protein is a hemolysin. Furthermore, the hemolysis can be inhibited by hyperimmune <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> F protein. The virus-induced cell fusion (syncytia) was also inhibited by the hyperimmune <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> the F protein. In summary, these results indicate that the purified PPRV F protein is biologically active and is involved in virus-induced hemolysis, cell-fusion and the initiation of infection...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this trial was to detect leptospires in fragments of kidney, liver and uterus of 96 cows with unknown sanitary status, randomly chosen at slaughter in Paraná, Brazil. All 96 urine samples were submitted to direct examination using dark field microscopy. Positive samples in the direct examination and all kidney, liver and uterus fragments were cultured in EMJH modified medium and Tween 80 / 40 /LH. Sections cut of kidney, liver and uterus were stained by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) and indirect immunoperoxidase with hyperimmune <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> serovar Hardjo (Hardjoprajitno) and strain Londrina 14 (LO 14), from serovar Canicola, which was isolated in the northern region of Paraná state, Brazil, used as primary antibodies. Direct examination detected leptospires in the urine of four animals. All attempts to isolate leptospires from urine and kidney, liver and uterus fragments were negative after 16 weeks of incubation. In the HE stain, focal infiltrate of mononuclear inflammatory cells was observed in the renal interstitial area of most animals. In the indirect immunoperoxidase assay using hyperimmune <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> LO 14 strain, the kidney of only one animal presented positive results.

40|$|Antigenic {{variants}} of influenza A virus strains emerge on serial passage in ovo {{in the presence}} of immune <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> different but related strains. An old laboratory strain (PR 8) which had been through hundreds of animal passages was as readily modified by this procedure as recently recovered strains. Such variants apparently can be obtained at will and show antigenic patterns which are reproducible and appear to be predictable in terms of the immune serum used for their selection. Variant strains retain their new antigenic patterns on serial passage in ovo in the absence of immune serum. Limited serial passage in ovo of strains in the absence of immune serum did not result in the emergence of antigenic variants.

40|$|Methods are {{described}} for the assay of chloroform-activated and fibrinolysin-activated plasma proteolytic enzyme, {{and for the}} determination of the inhibitory activity of plasma or other substances against chloroform-activated enzyme. The inhibitory activities of plasma, serum, and crude plasma albumin against chloroform-activated plasma proteolytic enzyme were proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of the inhibitory substance tested. This suggests that enzyme and inhibitor react in accordance with the law of mass action. The rate of fibrinolysis of recalcified plasma clots could not be related to the total proteolytic activity available in the plasma, nor to the inhibitory activity of fresh plasma or <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> plasma proteolytic enzyme. During the incubation of a recalcified plasma clot at 37 °C., the inhibitory activity of its <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> plasma proteolytic enzyme decreased until a minimal stationary level was reached. The clot lysis time could be correlated directly with the time which elapsed until this minimal level was reached...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 126 Haemophilus strains {{isolated}} from porcine pneumonia were serotyped, using the indirect fluorescent-antibody technique. Of these, 103 were successfully typed within the recognized scheme of serotypes 1 to 5.

60|$|It has {{sometimes}} been said that our domestic races do not differ in constitutional peculiarities, but this cannot be maintained. In our improved cattle, pigs, etc., the period of maturity, including that of the second dentition, has been much hastened.

In some breeds of poultry and pigeons the period at which the down and the first plumage are acquired, differs. The number of moults through which the larvae of silk-moths pass, varies. The tendency to fatten, to yield much milk, to produce many young or eggs at a birth or during life, differs in different breeds. We find different degrees of adaptation to climate, and different tendencies to certain diseases, to the attacks of parasites, and to the action of certain <b>vegetable</b> <b>poisons.</b> With plants, adaptation to certain soils, the power of resisting frost, the period of flowering and fruiting, the duration of life, the period of shedding the leaves or of retaining them throughout the winter, the proportion and nature of certain chemical compounds in the tissues or seeds, all vary.|$|R
40|$|Among the {{substances}} {{known to}} produce systolic contracture of the frog's heart are: (a) <b>vegetable</b> <b>poisons,</b> notably the glycosides of the digitalis group (1) and saponins (2); (b) animal venoms such as. {{those of the}} toad (3), the cobra, and other snakes (4); (c) certain bacterial toxins (5); (d) oxidizing agents (6).
