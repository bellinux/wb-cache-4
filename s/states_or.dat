5|$|Epiphenomenalism is a {{doctrine}} first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley. It {{consists of the}} view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states {{do not have any}} influence on physical <b>states</b> <b>or</b> mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world. This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by Frank Jackson.|$|E
5|$|For {{a general}} system, states are {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure <b>states,</b> <b>or</b> mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space.

Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization for pure states.|$|E

Aspen was also used for stakes, as it was believed that Christ's cross was made from aspen (aspen branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to prevent their risings at night).
