25|$|Hoover {{was best}} known for his civil air show career, which started when he was hired to {{demonstrate}} the capabilities of Aero Commander's Shrike Commander, a twin piston-engined business aircraft that had developed a staid reputation due to its bulky shape. Hoover showed the strength of the plane as he put the aircraft through rolls, loops, and other maneuvers, which most people would not associate with executive aircraft. As a grand finale, he shut down both engines and executed a loop and an eight-point hesitation <b>slow</b> <b>roll</b> as he headed back to the runway. Upon landing he would touch down on one tire followed gradually by the other. After pulling off the runway, he would start his engines to taxi back to the parking area. On airfields with large enough parking ramps (such as the Reno Stead Airport, where the Reno Air Races take place), Hoover would sometimes land directly on the ramp and coast {{all the way back to}} his parking spot in front of the grandstand without restarting the engines. He was also known for creating the stunt of successfully pouring a cup of tea while performing a 1G barrel roll.|$|E

He was posted to No. 3 Flying Training School at Grantham in Lincolnshire. He flew the Hawker Hart and the Hawker Audax {{for the first time on}} 20 May 1938.

5000|$|Gyroscopes {{were first}} {{used to control}} a ship's roll in the late 1920s and early 1930s for {{warships}} and then passenger liners. The most ambitious use of large gyros to control a ship's roll was on an Italian passenger liner, the SS Conte di Savoia, in which three large Sperry gyros were mounted in the forward part of the ship. While it proved successful in drastically reducing roll in the westbound trips, the system had to be disconnected on the eastbound leg for safety reasons. This was because with a following sea (and the deep <b>slow</b> <b>rolls</b> this generated) the vessel tended to 'hang' with the system turned on, and the inertia it generated made it harder for the vessel to right herself from heavy rolls.|$|R

In the second, or intermediate phase, pre-solo work was reviewed, and precision of control was developed. The third, or accuracy, phase demanded high proficiency in various types of landing approaches and landings, and the fourth, or acrobatic, phase required ability to perform loops, Immelmann turns, <b>slow</b> <b>rolls,</b> half-rolls, and snap rolls.

5000|$|The rate {{at which}} a <b>slow</b> <b>roll</b> can be {{performed}} is often determined by skill of the pilot. The better the pilot; the faster the roll can be performed. The <b>slow</b> <b>roll</b> is often used in aerobatic competitions and shows, displaying the pilot's ability to control the plane. Most rolls performed by fighter aircraft are slow rolls or partial slow-rolls, {{as opposed to an}} uncontrolled aileron roll, and this is especially true when flying in formation. A variation of the <b>slow</b> <b>roll</b> is the [...] "hesitation roll," [...] in which the pilot stops the roll at various [...] "points" [...] during the maneuver, maintaining a level flightpath at whatever angle of bank for a short time, such as 90 degrees (wings-vertical), 135 degrees (partly inverted) or 180 degrees (fully inverted). The pilot will then continue the roll to the next point, hesitating again. Such a roll may consist of any number of points, which are usually evenly spaced, with the most common being the two-point, three-point, and four-point rolls. However, the difficulty in maintaining level flight at the various angles requires the pilot to fully master the <b>slow</b> <b>roll</b> before attempting a hesitation roll.|$|E

Most {{of the show}} alternates between maneuvers performed by the Diamond Formation and those performed by the Solos. The Diamond, in tight formation and usually at lower speeds (400 mph), performs maneuvers such as formation loops, rolls, and transitions from one formation to another.

5000|$|Crank, is a {{condition}} in which a ship becomes when it heels abnormally, and recovers slowly under the action of the wind. If a ship makes long <b>slow</b> <b>rolls</b> and takes itʼs time to resume a vertical position, it is called: crank, cranky, crank- sided, tender, or tender-sided.

50|$|An {{improperly}} performed <b>slow</b> <b>roll</b> {{can easily}} {{result in a}} change in heading. Before performing the roll, the pilot will often pick a reference point on the horizon, located just above {{the nose of the}} plane. To keep a constant heading and attitude, the pilot will usually try to hold this reference point in a constant position over the nose as the horizon rotates around it. A <b>slow</b> <b>roll</b> can easily result in the aircraft falling out of the maneuver, so the pilot will usually need to ensure that the plane has sufficient altitude to recover if such an event occurs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>slow</b> <b>roll</b> appears {{similar to}} the aileron roll, except the roll rate is {{typically}} slower, and both the aircraft attitude and altitude are held consistent throughout the maneuver. The <b>slow</b> <b>roll</b> produces a constantly shifting load of one g-force on both the pilot and the aircraft, from one g positive in the upright position to one g negative in the inverted, caused by gravity. At {{the midpoint of the}} roll, the pilot will be hanging upside-down by the seatbelt, and any loose debris in the cockpit will fall to the canopy or out of the plane.|$|E
40|$|Cancellation {{control laws}} are {{designed}} which reduce {{the high levels}} of lateral acceleration encountered during aggressive rolling maneuvers executed at high angle of attack. Two independent problem are examined. One is to reduce lateral acceleration at the mass center, while the other focuses on lateral acceleration at the pilot's station, located 7. 0 m forward of the mass center. Both of these problems are challenging and somewhat different in their limitations. In each case the design is based on a linearization of the lateral-directional dynamics about a high angle of attack condition. The controllers incorporate dynamic inversion inner loops to provide control of stability-axis roll- and yaw-rates and then employ cancellation filters in both feed-forward and feed-back signal paths. The relative simplicity of the control laws should allow nonlinear generalizations to be devised. Although it is shown that lateral acceleration can be reduced substantially by such control laws, this is at the cost of <b>slowed</b> <b>roll</b> response, poor dutch-roll damping or a combination of the two...|$|R
50|$|Primary {{maneuvers}} {{are those}} which are performed without respect to an enemy's position. These are often simple maneuvers, such as climbs, turns, aileron <b>rolls,</b> <b>slow</b> <b>rolls,</b> and rudder rolls. Relative maneuvers are performed {{in relation to the}} motion of another aircraft. These are often more complex, including energy saving maneuvers, such as the high and low Yo-Yos, and repositioning maneuvers such as displacement rolls. It is easy to fall into the trap of considering BFM to be a series of set maneuvers providing a foolproof recipe for a dominant position. The reality is that BFM are a series of fluid and often improvised proactive and reactive actions, varying infinitely according to range, altitude, speed, aircraft type, weapons system type and any of an enormous range of other factors. An extremely successful tactic one day may yield unfortunate results if repeated the next day, and pilots often credit luck as a major factor.|$|R

In mirror formations, one Thunderbird must be inverted, and it is always Thunderbird Number 5. In fact, the [...] "5" [...] on this aircraft is painted on upside down, and thus appears right-side-up for much of the routine).
