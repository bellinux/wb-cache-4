5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. All {{of them are}} soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some {{of them can be}} cut with a knife. Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium {{is similar to that of}} <b>soft</b> <b>steel,</b> so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d-transition metals.|$|E

50|$|The Pzgr.41 had a {{tungsten}} carbide core, a <b>softer</b> <b>steel</b> casing and a magnesium alloy ballistic cap. The core was 40 mm long and 10.9 mm {{in diameter and}} contained about 9.1% of tungsten.|$|R
50|$|Tungsten carbide is used {{extensively}} in mining in top hammer rock drill bits, downhole hammers, roller-cutters, long wall plough chisels, long wall shearer picks, raiseboring reamers, and tunnel boring machines. It is generally utilised as a button insert, mounted in a surrounding matrix of steel {{that forms the}} substance of the bit. As the tungsten carbide button is worn away the <b>softer</b> <b>steel</b> matrix containing it is also worn away, exposing yet more button insert.|$|R
25|$|The {{masonry bit}} shown {{here is a}} {{variation}} of the twist drill bit. The bulk of the tool is a relatively <b>soft</b> <b>steel,</b> and is machined with a mill rather than ground. An insert of tungsten carbide is brazed into the steel to provide the cutting edges.|$|E
25|$|To prevent scarring, it is {{prudent to}} {{periodically}} inspect the brake pads for wear. A tire rotation {{is a logical}} time for inspection, since rotation must be performed regularly based on vehicle operation time and all wheels must be removed, allowing ready visual access to the brake pads. Some types of alloy wheels and brake arrangements will provide enough open space to view the pads without removing the wheel. When practical, pads that are near the wear-out point should be replaced immediately, as complete wear out leads to scarring damage and unsafe braking. Many disc brake pads will include some sort of <b>soft</b> <b>steel</b> spring or drag tab {{as part of the}} pad assembly, which is designed to start dragging on the disc when the pad is nearly worn out. The result is a moderately loud metallic squealing noise, alerting the vehicle user that service is required, and this will not normally scar the disc if the brakes are serviced promptly. A set of pads can be considered for replacement if the thickness of the pad material is the same or less than the thickness of the backing steel. In Pennsylvania, the standard is 1/32".|$|E
500|$|Thorium metal has a {{bulk modulus}} (a measure of {{resistance}} to compression of a material) of 54GPa, {{about the same as}} tin's (58.2GPa). Aluminium's is 75.2GPa; copper's 137.8GPa; and mild steel's is 160–169GPa. Thorium is about as hard as <b>soft</b> <b>steel,</b> so when heated it can be rolled into sheets and pulled into wire.|$|E

5000|$|This is the {{predecessor}} of all metal colouring typically {{employed in the}} firearms industry. Contemporary heat-treatable steels did not exist or were in their infancy. <b>Soft,</b> low-carbon <b>steel</b> was used, but strong materials were needed for the receivers of firearms. Initially case hardening was used but didn't offer any aesthetics. Colour case hardening occurs when <b>soft</b> <b>steels</b> were packed in a reasonably airtight crucible {{in a mixture of}} charred leather, bone charcoal and wood charcoal. This crucible was heated to [...] for up to 6 hours (the longer the heat was applied the thicker the case hardening). At the end of this heating process the crucible is removed from the oven and positioned over a bath of water with air forced through a perforated coil {{in the bottom of the}} bath. The bottom of the crucible is opened allowing the contents to drop into the rapidly bubbling water. The differential cooling causes patterns of colours to appear as well as hardening the part.|$|R
50|$|The {{composition}} of the stone affects the sharpness of the blade (a finer grain, usually, though not always, produces sharper blades), as does the {{composition of}} the blade (some metals take and keep an edge better than others). For example, Western kitchen knives are usually made of <b>softer</b> <b>steel</b> and take an edge angle of 20-22°, while East Asian kitchen knives are traditionally of harder steel and take an edge angle of 15-18°. The Western-style kitchen knives are generally in the range of 52-58 on the Rockwell scale, which denotes the relative hardness of a material.|$|R
500|$|The {{underwater}} {{protection system}} {{was designed to}} withstand a direct hit from a [...] explosive warhead; British aerial torpedoes had smaller warheads than this, though their ship-launched weapons were more powerful. The navy conducted several full-scale underwater explosion tests with sections of armour cut from the old pre-dreadnought [...] The tests revealed that welded steel construction better withstood {{the impact of the}} 250kg warhead than did riveted steel plates. However, the torpedo bulkhead, composed of Wotan Weich (Wotan, <b>soft)</b> <b>steel,</b> placed behind the armoured belt was riveted; this was done because plate joints that had been incorrectly welded would not sufficiently withstand explosive shocks. The underwater protection system was constructed out of several layers: the outer layer that was between 12–66mm (.47–2.6in) thick, directly underneath the main armoured belt, was designed to detonate the torpedo warhead. Behind the outer plate was a large void which would allow gases from the explosion to expand and dissipate. Beyond this was a fuel bunker with an [...] thick outer wall; this would absorb any remaining explosive force. The bunker was supported by longitudinal stiffeners and transverse bulkheads.|$|E

2500|$|The USSR donated two combat-used Model 1941 T-34s to the United States {{for testing}} {{purposes}} in late 1942. The examinations, performed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, revealed problems with overall armour build quality, especially of the plate joins and welds, {{as well as the}} use of <b>soft</b> <b>steel</b> combined with shallow surface tempering. Leak issues were noted: [...] "In a heavy rain lots of water flows through chinks/cracks, which leads to the disabling of the electrical equipment and even the ammunition". Earlier models of the T-34, until the Model 1942, had cast turrets whose armour was softer than that of the other parts of the tank, and offered poor resistance even to 37mm anti-aircraft shells.|$|E

50|$|Yatagans {{consist of}} a single-edged blade with a marked forward curve and a hilt formed of two grip plaques {{attached}} through the tang, {{the end of the}} hilt being shaped like large ears. The gap between the grips is covered by a metal strap, which is often decorated. The blade varies from 60 to 80 cm in length and is curved forward (like the Iberian falcata, or Greek kopis), sometimes reclining backwards again towards the very end. This blade form {{is often referred to as}} being 'recurved.' While the back of the blade is made of <b>softer</b> <b>steel,</b> the sharp edge is made of hard, tempered steel for durability.|$|R
25|$|Traditional jian blades {{are usually}} of sanmei (three plate) construction, which {{involved}} sandwiching {{a core of}} hard steel between two plates of <b>softer</b> <b>steel.</b> The central plate protrudes slightly from its surrounding pieces, allowing for a sharp edge, while the softer spine protects the brittle core. Some blades had wumei or five plate construction, with two more soft plates being used at the central ridge. Bronze jian were often made in a somewhat similar manner: in this case an alloy with a high copper content {{would be used to}} make a resilient core and spine, while the edge would be made from a high-tin-content alloy for sharpness and welded onto the rest of the blade.|$|R
2500|$|... (3) In machine {{engraving}} {{the pattern}} is impressed in the roller by a small cylindrical mill on which {{the pattern is}} in relief. It is an indirect process and requires the utmost care at every stage. The pattern or design is first altered in size to repeat evenly round the roller. One repeat of this pattern is then engraved by hand on a small highly polished <b>soft</b> <b>steel</b> roller, usually about 3 in. long and 1/2 in. to 3 in. in diameter; the size varies according {{to the size of}} the repeat with which it must be identical. It is then repolished, painted with a chalky mixture to prevent its surface oxidizing and exposed to a red-heat in a box filled with chalk and charcoal; then it is plunged in cold water to harden it and finally tempered to the proper degree of toughness. In this state it forms the die from which the mill is made. To produce the actual mill with the design in relief a softened steel cylinder is screwed tightly against the hardened die and the two are rotated under constantly increasing pressure until the softened cylinder or mill has received an exact replica in relief of the engraved pattern. The mill in turn is then hardened and tempered, when it is ready for use. In size it may be either exactly like the die or its circumferential measurement may be any multiple of that of the latter according to circumstances.|$|E

6000|$|Steels.--The {{possession}} of a really good steel {{is a matter of}} great comfort in rough travel, for, as I have just said, common iron is incompetent to afford a useful spark, and hardened iron or <b>soft</b> <b>steel</b> is barely sufficient to do so.

5000|$|Due to {{the quality}} of metal found in Japan, Japanese bladesmithing became an {{extremely}} rigid, precise process, involving folding and forge-welding the steel many times over to create a laminated blade. By the time of the Kamakura period (1185-1333 AD), Japan was under the rule of a military class and repelling Mongol invasions. This became known as the [...] "Golden era" [...] of Japanese bladesmithing under Emperor Toba II, who became a bladesmith himself. [...] After adbicating, Toba II summoned Japan's finest bladesmiths around him in an effort to develop the perfect sword. [...] It was determined that a sword had to be hard in order to maintain a sharp cutting edge, yet hard steel is brittle and can shatter under the stress of a heavy blow. [...] Swordsmiths in Japan found the solution by wrapping a <b>softer</b> low-carbon <b>steel</b> core such as wrought iron, in a jacket of high-carbon steel and then hardening the edge. [...] However, under heavy usage, the edge would be more prone to chipping than its European counterparts, which were typically designed to deal with heavier armor than Japanese blades. [...] This was answered by allowing projections of <b>softer</b> <b>steel</b> known as ashi to form in the hardened cutting edge during differential hardening of the blade.|$|R

60|$|Sharpening Tools.--A {{man will}} get through most {{work with his}} tools, if he stops {{from time to time}} to sharpen them up. The son of Sirach says, {{speaking}} of a carpenter--"If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength; but wisdom is profitable to direct."--Ecclesiasticus. A small fine file is very effectual in giving an edge to tools of <b>soft</b> <b>steel.</b> It is a common error to suppose that the best edge is given by grinding the sides of the tool until they meet at an exceedingly acute angle. Such an edge would have no strength, and would chip or bend directly. The proper way of sharpening a tool, is to grind it until it is sufficiently thin, and then to give it an edge whose sides are inclined to one another, about as much as those of the letter V. The edge of a chisel is an obvious case in point; so also is the edge of a butcher's knife, which is given by applying it to the steel at a considerable inclination. A razor has only to cut hairs, and will splinter if used to mend a pen, yet even a razor is shaped like a wedge, that it may not receive too fine an edge when stropped with its face flat upon the hone.|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of thermochemical heat treatment (e. g. nitriding or carburizing, {{with or without}} plasma enhancement) and hard coating (e. g.

However, also machine parts and precision components are very promising candidats for duplex treatments, especially when they are made of <b>soft</b> <b>steels</b> such as stainless steels.
