5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|In electronics, a <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> uses {{frequency}} mixing or heterodyning {{to convert}} a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency, {{which can be}} more conveniently processed than the original radio carrier frequency. Virtually all modern radio and television receivers use the superheterodyne principle. The <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> was invented in 1918 by Edwin Armstrong. It {{was introduced to the}} market place in the late 1920s.|$|E
25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} to the <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> is {{the problem}} of image frequency. In heterodyne receivers, an image frequency is an undesired input frequency equal to the station frequency plus twice the intermediate frequency. The image frequency results in two stations being received at the same time, thus producing interference. Image frequencies can be eliminated by sufficient attenuation on the incoming signal by the RF amplifier filter of the <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver.</b>|$|E

50|$|Ceramic {{resonators}} look {{similar to}} ceramic filters. Ceramic filters are frequently {{used in the}} IF stages of <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receivers.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{technique}} can be {{countered by}} shielding the intermediate frequency circuitry of <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receivers,</b> or moving into software-defined radio using digital signal processors with no local oscillator.|$|R
25|$|Radio {{transmitters}} {{may also}} use a mixer stage to produce an output frequency, working more or less as the reverse of a <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver.</b>|$|E
25|$|Microprocessor {{technology}} allows {{replacing the}} <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> design by a {{software defined radio}} architecture, where the IF processing after the initial IF filter is implemented in software. This technique is already in use in certain designs, such as very low-cost FM radios incorporated into mobile phones, since the system already has the necessary microprocessor.|$|E
25|$|A <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver,</b> often {{shortened}} to superhet, {{is a type}} {{of radio}} receiver that uses frequency mixing to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) which can be more conveniently processed than the original carrier frequency. It was invented by US engineer Edwin Armstrong in 1918 during World War I. Virtually all modern radio receivers use the superheterodyne principle.|$|E

50|$|An RF {{receiver}} module receives the modulated RF signal, and demodulates it. There {{are two types}} of RF <b>receiver</b> modules: <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receivers</b> and super-regenerative receivers. Super-regenerative modules are usually low cost and low power designs using a series of amplifiers to extract modulated data from a carrier wave. Super-regenerative modules are generally imprecise as their frequency of operation varies considerably with temperature and power supply voltage. <b>Superheterodyne</b> <b>receivers</b> have a performance advantage over super-regenerative; they offer increased accuracy and stability over a large voltage and temperature range. This stability comes from a fixed crystal design which in the past tended to mean a comparatively more expensive product. However, advances in receiver chip design now mean that currently there is little price difference between <b>superheterodyne</b> and super-regenerative <b>receiver</b> modules.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: One of {{the first}} amateur <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receivers,</b> built in 1920 even before Armstrong {{published}} his paper. Due to the low gain of early triodes it required 9 tubes, with 5 IF amplification stages, and used an IF of around 50 kHz.|$|R
25|$|The {{receiver}} {{is generally}} {{one of two}} types: a super-regenerative receiver or a superheterodyne. The super-regenerative receiver works like that of an intermittent oscillation detection circuit. The superheterodyne works {{like the one in}} a radio receiver. The <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> is used because of its stability, high sensitivity and it has relatively good anti-interference ability, a small package and lower price.|$|E
25|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} {{have essentially}} replaced all previous receiver designs. The development of modern semiconductor electronics negated {{the advantages of}} designs (such as the regenerative receiver) that used fewer vacuum tubes. The <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> offers superior sensitivity, frequency stability and selectivity. Compared with the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) design, superhets offer better stability because a tuneable oscillator is more easily realized than a tuneable amplifier. Operating at a lower frequency, IF filters can give narrower passbands at the same Q factor than an equivalent RF filter. A fixed IF also allows {{the use of a}} crystal filter or similar technologies that cannot be tuned. Regenerative and super-regenerative receivers offered a high sensitivity, but often suffer from stability problems making them difficult to operate.|$|E
25|$|As of its {{founding}} RCA {{was the largest}} radio communications firm in the United States. However, American Marconi had been falling behind industry advances, particularly in vacuum tube technology, and GE needed access to additional patents before its new subsidiary could be fully competitive. The result {{was a series of}} negotiations and a complicated set of cross-licensing agreements between various companies. On July 1, 1920, an agreement was made with the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT), which purchased 500,000 shares of RCA, although it would divest these shares in early 1923. The United Fruit Company held a small portfolio of radio patents, and signed two agreements in 1921. GE's traditional electric company rival, the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Corporation, had also purchased rights to some critical patents, including one for heterodyne receiving originally issued to Reginald Fessenden, plus regenerative circuit and <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> patents issued to Edwin Armstrong. Westinghouse was able to use this to negotiate a cross-licensing agreement, effective July 1, 1921, that included a concession that 40% of RCA's equipment purchases would be from Westinghouse. Following these transactions, GE owned 30.1% of RCA's stock, Westinghouse 20.6%, AT 10.3%, and United Fruit 4.1%, with the remaining 34.9% owned by individual shareholders.|$|E
50|$|For single {{conversion}} <b>superheterodyne</b> AM <b>receivers</b> {{designed for}} medium wave (AM broadcast) the IF is commonly 455 kHz. Most <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receivers</b> designed for broadcast FM (88 - 108 MHz) use an IF of 10.7 MHz. TV receivers often use intermediate frequencies of about 40 MHz. Some modern multiband receivers actually convert lower frequency bands first {{to a much}} higher frequency (VHF) after which a second mixer with a tunable local oscillator and a second IF stage process the signal as above.|$|R
5000|$|Therefore {{other methods}} {{may be used}} to {{increase}} selectivity, such as Q multiplier circuits and regenerative <b>receivers.</b> <b>Superheterodyne</b> <b>receivers</b> allow use one or more fixed intermediate frequency tuned circuits for selectivity. Fixed tuning eliminates the requirement that multiple tuning stages accurately match while being adjusted.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{frequency}} of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) {{varies with the}} voltage applied to its tuning port. Operating in a phase-locked loop (PLL), the VCO provides a stable local oscillator (LO) for frequency conversion in <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receivers.</b> VCOs are also used in transmit chains, where they upconvert the baseband signal to a radio frequency (RF) suitable for transmission over the airwaves. The {{frequency of}} a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) varies with the voltage applied to its tuning port. Operating in a phase-locked loop (PLL), the VCO provides a stable local oscillator (LO) for frequency conversion in <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receivers.</b> VCOs are also used in transmit chains, where they upconvert the baseband signal to a radio frequency (RF) suitable for transmission over the airwaves (Figure 1) ...|$|R
2500|$|Earliest {{research}} towards {{what was}} later named the phase-locked loop {{goes back to}} 1932, when British researchers developed an alternative to Edwin Armstrong's <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver,</b> the Homodyne or direct-conversion receiver. In the homodyne or synchrodyne system, a local oscillator was tuned to the desired input frequency and multiplied with the input signal. The resulting output signal included the original modulation information. [...] The intent was to develop an alternative receiver circuit that required fewer tuned circuits than the <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver.</b> [...] Since the local oscillator would rapidly drift in frequency, an automatic correction signal {{was applied to the}} oscillator, maintaining it in the same phase and frequency of the desired signal. The technique was described in 1932, in a paper by Henri de Bellescize, in the French journal L'Onde Électrique.|$|E
2500|$|He {{patented}} the regenerative circuit in 1914, the <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> in 1918 and the super-regenerative circuit in 1922. Armstrong {{presented his}} paper, [...] "A Method of Reducing Disturbances in Radio Signaling by a System of Frequency Modulation", (which first described FM radio) before the New York {{section of the}} Institute of Radio Engineers on November 6, 1935. The paper was published in 1936.|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{the ranges}} 29MHz to 30MHz; 28MHz to 29MHz etc. might be {{converted}} down to 2MHz to 3MHz, there {{they can be}} tuned more conveniently. This is often done by first converting each [...] "block" [...] up to a higher frequency (typically 40MHz) and then using a second mixer to convert {{it down to the}} 2MHz to 3MHz range. The 2MHz to 3MHz [...] "IF" [...] is basically another self-contained <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver,</b> most likely with a standard IF of 455kHz.|$|E

It is constructed in two sections, the mixer and local oscillator (left) and three IF amplification stages and a detector stage (right). The intermediate frequency was 75 kHz.|$|R
5000|$|By the mid-1930s, {{commercial}} production of TRF receivers was largely replaced by <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receivers.</b> By the 1940s the vacuum-tube <b>superheterodyne</b> AM broadcast <b>receiver</b> was refined into a cheap-to-manufacture design called the [...] "All American Five", because it only used five vacuum tubes: usually a converter (mixer/local oscillator), an IF amplifier, a detector/audio amp, audio power amp, and a rectifier.

2500|$|A {{basic list}} of topics {{to be covered}} was prescribed, but {{it was up to}} the schools to develop this into a three-month {{instructional}} program. Mandatory topics included the following: advanced d-c and a-c circuit theory, electrical motors and generators, vacuum-tube characteristics, power supplies, amplifiers, oscillators, modulation techniques, filters and wave-shaping, receiver circuits, transmitter circuits, transmission lines and antennas, and basic electromagnetic propagation theory. Mathematical topics (mainly trigonometry and elementary calculus) were taken up when necessary for developing theoretical equations. Each student built a <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver,</b> and fault-finding was taught using systematic signal-tracing.|$|E
2500|$|The mixer will process {{not only}} the desired input signal at fRF, but also all signals present at its inputs. There will be many mixer {{products}} (heterodynes). Most other signals produced by the mixer (such as due to stations at nearby frequencies) can be filtered out in the IF amplifier; that gives the <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> its superior performance. However, if fLO is set to fRF+fIF, then an incoming radio signal at fLO+fIF will also produce a heterodyne at fIF; the frequency [...] fLO+fIF is called the image frequency and must be rejected by the tuned circuits in the RF stage. The image frequency is 2fIF higher (or lower) than the desired frequency fRF, so employing a higher IF frequency fIF increases the receiver's image rejection without requiring additional selectivity in the RF stage.|$|E
2500|$|The diagram {{at right}} shows the block diagram {{of a typical}} single-conversion <b>{{superheterodyne}}</b> <b>receiver.</b> The diagram has blocks that are common to superheterodyne receivers. The antenna collects the radio signal. [...] The tuned RF stage with optional RF amplifier provides some initial selectivity; {{it is necessary to}} suppress the image frequency (see below), and may also serve to prevent strong out-of-passband signals from saturating the initial amplifier. A local oscillator provides the mixing frequency; it is usually a variable frequency oscillator which is used to tune the receiver to different stations. [...] The frequency mixer does the actual heterodyning that gives the superheterodyne its name; it changes the incoming radio frequency signal to a higher or lower, fixed, intermediate frequency (IF). [...] The IF band-pass filter and amplifier supply most of the gain and the narrowband filtering for the radio. [...] The demodulator extracts the audio or other modulation from the IF radio frequency; the extracted signal is then amplified by the audio amplifier.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to keep stray radiation from the local oscillator below the level that a nearby receiver can detect. The receiver's local oscillator can act like a low-power CW transmitter. Consequently, there can be mutual interference {{in the operation of}} two or more <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receivers</b> in close proximity.|$|R
50|$|Crystal-controlled <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receivers</b> {{with better}} {{selectivity}} and stability made control equipment more capable and at lower cost. Multi-channel developments were of particular use to aircraft, which really needed {{a minimum of}} three control dimensions (yaw, pitch and motor speed), as opposed to boats, which required only two or one.|$|R

25|$|Early <b>superheterodyne</b> <b>receivers</b> used IFs {{as low as}} 20kHz, {{often based}} on the self-resonance of iron-cored transformers.
