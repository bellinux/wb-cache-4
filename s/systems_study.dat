50|$|While the {{individual}} systems constituting {{a system of}} systems can be very different and operate independently, their interactions typically expose and deliver important emergent properties. These emergent patterns have an evolving nature that stakeholders must recognize, analyze and understand.

50|$|A {{dedicated}} commercial air freighter is {{an airplane}} {{which has been}} designed from the beginning as a freighter, with no restrictions caused by either passenger or military requirements. Over the years, {{there has been a}} dispute concerning the cost effectiveness of such an airplane, with some cargo carriers stating that they could consistently earn a profit if they had such an aircraft. To help resolve this disagreement, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) selected two contractors, Douglas Aircraft Co. and Lockheed-Georgia Co., to independently evaluate the possibility of producing such a freighter by 1990. This was done as part of the Cargo/Logistics Airlift <b>Systems</b> <b>Study</b> (CLASS). At comparable payloads, dedicated cargo aircraft was said to provide a 20 percent reduction in trip cost and a 15 percent decrease in aircraft price compared to other cargo aircraft. These findings, however, are extremely sensitive to assumptions about fuel and labor costs and, most particularly, to growth in demand for air cargo services. Further, it ignores the competitive situation brought about by the lower capital costs of future derivative air cargo aircraft.|$|E

The Feasibility of Telesurgery Across Metropolitan Hospital <b>Systems</b> <b>study</b> determines what the lag time is between two locations, then mimics that lag time using simulators and/or video displays to study how a surgeon responds to it. The Nicholson Center researched to determine if telesurgery can be performed based on bandwidth available and whether a surgeon can handle the lag time that is in place. The research team, headed by Chief Technology Officer, Dr. Roger Smith, had successfully tested the lag time to Ft. Worth, Texas, a location more than 1,200 miles away. This research determined that telesurgery is safe and possible in the United States.The telesurgery research benefits the US military by finding the necessary steps to providing specialized healthcare for wounded soldiers in remote locations.

Long-term Scenarios for Market Development, System Prices and LCOE of Utility-Scale PV <b>Systems.</b> <b>Study</b> {{on behalf}} of Agora Energiewende (February 2015) — #Solar {{photovoltaics}} is already today a low-cost renewable energy technology. Cost of power from large scale photovoltaic installations in Germany fell from over 40 ct/kWh in 2005 to 9 cts/kWh in 2014. Even lower prices {{have been reported in}} sunnier regions of the world, since a major share of cost components is traded on global markets.#Solar power will soon be the cheapest form of electricity in many regions of the world. Even in conservative scenarios and assuming no major technological breakthroughs, an end to cost reduction is not in sight. Depending on annual sunshine, power cost of 4-6 cts/kWh are expected by 2025, reaching 2-4 ct/kWh by 2050 (conservative estimate).#Financial and regulatory environments will be key to reducing cost in the future. Cost of hardware sourced from global markets will decrease irrespective of local conditions. However, inadequate regulatory regimes may increase cost of power by up to 50 percent through higher cost of finance. This may even overcompensate the effect of better local solar resources.#Most scenarios fundamentally underestimate the role of solar power in future energy systems. Based on outdated cost estimates, most scenarios modeling future domestic, regional or global power systems foresee only a small contribution of solar power. The results of our analysis indicate that a fundamental review of cost-optimal power system pathways is necessary.|$|E
