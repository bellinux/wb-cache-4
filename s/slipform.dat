500|$|Additional {{commissions}} from important {{clients as}} well as notable buildings continued in the 1970s. Construction on the Koubek-designed , $23 million L'Enfant Plaza Hotel and office building began until June 1971. In July 1970, construction began on his 37-story, pink granite United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company Building in Baltimore. It was the largest building yet constructed in the United States to employ the <b>slipform</b> method of continuously poured concrete. The USF Building successfully sparked the economic revival of the Inner Harbor. Opened in 1974, as of 2010 it remained the tallest building in Baltimore. Forty years later, it is considered a Baltimore landmark. Richard Burns of Design Collective Inc. has said, [...] "In my opinion, his USF tower, now Legg Mason, {{is one of the}} best if not the best office buildings in downtown Baltimore. It is simple, direct and honest..." [...] David Wallace, whose Wallace Roberts and Todd designed the master site plan for the Inner Harbor, declared it the [...] "linchpin for the Inner Harbor. If you look at it from a boat, it's a punctuation point at one corner of the Inner Harbor, signifying where the central business district meets the waterfront." [...] Construction started on his eight-story 2021 K Street NW office building in November 1970. In the summer of 1971, he completed his site plan for Friendship Heights, a [...] site straddling the boundary between the District of Columbia and Maryland border at Friendship Heights/Friendship Village. The plan contemplated several high-rise office buildings, a loop roadway around the site, pedestrian concourses, and several multi-story shopping malls clustered around the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and Western Avenue. (The project was built throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s.) In March 1971, the American Automobile Association commissioned him to design a six-story, $10-million headquarters for the group at 8111 Gatehouse Road in Fairfax, Virginia. Eight months later, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) began construction on a Koubek-designed headquarters at 1625 Massachusetts Avenue NW, three blocks northwest from his 1965 office building and across the street from the Philippine Embassy. In March 1974, developer Melvin Lenkin commissioned Koubek to design an all-glass Modernist building for 1900 M Street NW. [...] Koubek designed an eight-story cubist building with an all-glass facade; cutaway, cantilevered front corner; and ground floor arcade. In March 1975, the National Bank of Washington, one of the city's oldest and most storied banks, commissioned a new operations center (4340 Connecticut Avenue NW) from Koubek. In May 1975, Koubek joined a consortium of prominent local architects to design the Washington Harbor complex of buildings on the Georgetown waterfront. The three-block-long, eight-building complex, which contained luxury condominiums, office space, restaurants, luxury retail space, a boardwalk, and plaza, was the first large-scale redevelopment of Georgetown's waterfront in the city's history. By the end of 1975, The New York Times was reporting that Koubek's firm had designed roughly half the office buildings built in the District of Columbia since the 1950s.|$|E

The 'embedded rail structure', used in the Netherlands since 1976, initially used a conventional UIC54 rail embedded in concrete, and later developed (late 1990s) to use a 'mushroom' shaped SA42 rail profile; a version for light rail using a rail supported in an asphalt concrete–filled steel trough has also been developed (2002).|$|R
25|$|The towers were {{constructed}} by <b>slipforming,</b> {{and the north}} tower was completed by May 1974. The southern foundations were completed in September 1975, with the pier completed in March 1976, and the southern tower was completed by September 1976. The bridge itself had been planned to open in 1976. The northern tower and anchorage was built on solid chalk, but the southern tower and anchorage were built on fissured Kimmeridge Clay, and 500 metres from the southern shore, and built with a difficult caisson design. The subcontractor for the concrete was Tileman &. Co. Ltd of Shipston-on-Stour, south Warwickshire.|$|R

The site at the Limmat demanded piles basing up {{to a depth of}} 45 m in the bedrock of the Limmat Valley. The increase of the former building by 118 m was done by <b>slipforming</b> by up to 60 construction workers who processed concrete in three shifts around the clock. The construction was divided into two stages; the first construction phase was completed in early July 2015, the second began on 21 September 2015. The construction phase ended in April 2016.|$|R

40|$|In {{the course}} of the 20 th century, {{architectural}} construction has gone through intense innovation in its material, engineering and design, radically transforming the way buildings were and are conceived. Technological and industrial advances enabled and challenged architects, engineers and constructors to build increasingly complex architectural structures from concrete. Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) techniques have, more recently, rejuvenated and increased the possibilities of realising ever more complex geometries. Reinforced concrete is often chosen for such structures since almost any shape can be achieve when poured into a formwork. However, designs generated with digital tools tend to have limited relation to the efficient modes of production typically used in contemporary concrete construction. A large gap has emerged between the technology in architectural design and the building industry, so that few efficient solutions exist for the production of geometrically complex structures in concrete. This paper focuses on the capabilities and efficiency of existing casting techniques both with static and dynamic formwork which, when combined with digital fabrication, allow innovative fabrication approaches to be taken. Particular focus is placed on <b>slipforming,</b> an approved and efficient construction technique, which until now is unexplored in conjunction with digital fabrication...|$|R

50|$|<b>Slipform</b> Stonemasonry: <b>Slipform</b> stonemasonry is {{a method}} for making stone walls {{with the aid of}} {{formwork}} to contain the rocks and mortar while keeping the walls straight. Short forms, up to two feet tall, are placed {{on both sides of the}} wall to serve as a guide for the stone work. Stones are placed inside the forms with the good faces against the form work. Concrete is poured behind the rocks. Rebar is added for strength, to make a wall that is approximately half reinforced concrete and half stonework. The wall can be faced with stone on one side or both sides.|$|E

40|$|This project {{consisted}} of <b>slipforming</b> a 4 -inch thick econocrete subbase on a 6 -mile section of US 63. The project location extends south from one mile south of Denver, Iowa to Black Hawk County Road C- 66 and {{consisted of}} the reconstruction and new construction of a divided four-lane facility. The econocrete was placed 27. 3 feet wide in a single pass. Fly ash {{was used in this}} field study to replace 30, 45 and 60 percent of the portland cement in three portland cement econocrete base paving mixes. The three mixes contained 300, 350 and 400 pounds of cementitious material per cubic yard. Two Class "C" ashes from Iowa approved sources were used. The ash was substituted on the basis of one pound of ash for each pound of cement removed. The work was done October 6 - 29, 1987 and May 25 -June 9, 1988. The twelve subbase mixes were placed in sections 2500 to 3000 feet in length on both the north and southbound roadways. Compressive strengths of all mixes were determined at 3 and 28 days of age. Flexural strengths of all mixes were determined at 7 and 14 days. In all cases strengths were adequate. The freeze/thaw durability of the econocrete mixes used was reduced by increased fly ash levels but remained above acceptable limits. The test results demonstrate the feasibility of producing econocrete with satisfactory properties even using fly ash at substitution rates up to 45 percent...|$|R

50|$|Storage silos are {{cylindrical}} structures, typically 10 to 90 ft (3 to 27 m) {{in diameter}} and 30 to 275 ft (10 to 90 m) in height with the <b>slipform</b> and Jumpform concrete silos being the larger diameter and taller silos. They can be made of many materials. Wood staves, concrete staves, cast concrete, and steel panels have all been used, and have varying cost, durability, and airtightness tradeoffs. Silos storing grain, cement and woodchips are typically unloaded with air slides or augers. Silos can be unloaded into rail cars, trucks or conveyors.|$|E
50|$|Standing at 160 metres (520 ft) from {{street level}} and 236 metres (775 ft) {{from the bottom}} of the falls, the tower {{required}} approval from both Canadian and United States air transport authorities, due to its proximity to the international boundary. It was the second tower to be built using the <b>slipform</b> method, in which concrete is continually poured into a form moving slowly up the tower. It was built by Pigott Construction of Hamilton, Ontario. The same methods were also used to build the Inco Superstack in Sudbury, and the CN Tower in Toronto.|$|E
50|$|The {{concrete}} structure, {{design by}} architect Paul Hedqvist and built in 1935, {{is composed of}} 64 pillars, each of 1×1 metre cross section and 14 metres tall, carrying the uninsulated tank of 78×39×6 metres, containing 18 thousand cubic metres, crowned by a small lantern. One {{of the most prominent}} landmarks in central Stockholm observable from elevated locations kilometres away, the classical structure has a monumentality further amplified by its elevated location in a forest remote from any other buildings. It is one of few remaining, visible traces of the ambitious municipal projects carried through in the early 20th century, still witnessing the restraints and possibilities of casting techniques anticipating pre-stressed concrete and <b>slipform</b> constructions.|$|E
50|$|The {{purposes}} of the walls in buildings are to support roofs, floors and ceilings; to enclose a space {{as part of the}} building envelope along with a roof to give buildings form; and to provide shelter and security. In addition, the wall may house various types of utilities such as electrical wiring or plumbing. Wall construction falls into two basic categories: framed walls or mass-walls. In framed walls the load is transferred to the foundation through posts, columns or studs. Framed walls most often have three or more separate components: the structural elements (such as 2×4 studs in a house wall), insulation, and finish elements or surfaces (such as drywall or panelling). Mass-walls are of a solid material including masonry, concrete including <b>slipform</b> stonemasonry, log building, cordwood construction, adobe, rammed earth, cob, earthbag construction, bottles, tin cans, straw-bale construction, and ice.|$|E
5000|$|Slip forming, {{continuous}} poured, continuously formed, or <b>slipform</b> {{construction is}} a construction method in which concrete is poured into a continuously moving form. [...] Slip forming {{is used for}} tall structures (such as bridges, towers, buildings, and dams), as well as horizontal structures, such as roadways. Slipforming enables continuous, non-interrupted, cast-in-place [...] "flawless" [...] (i.e. no joints) concrete structures which have superior performance characteristics to piecewise construction using discrete form elements. Slip forming relies on the quick-setting properties of concrete, and requires a balance between quick-setting capacity and workability. Concrete needs to be workable enough to be placed into the form and consolidated (via vibration), yet quick-setting enough {{to emerge from the}} form with strength. This strength is needed because the freshly set concrete must not only permit the form to [...] "slip" [...] by the concrete without disturbing it, but also support the pressure of the new concrete as well as resist collapse caused by the vibration of the compaction machinery.|$|E
