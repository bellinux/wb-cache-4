2500|$|Instead of {{settling}} down {{at home in}} what was most expected (a spinsterhood dedicated to caring for her mother), Kenny continued {{to work as a}} nurse from her mother's home, often being brought to her patients in the sidecar of a motorcycle or by automobile. When a family friend's daughter Sylvia was injured by falling into the path of a horse-drawn plough, the friend called Kenny for help. Kenny improvised a stretcher from a cupboard door, fastened Sylvia to it and accompanied her the [...] to Dr.McDonnell's Toowoomba office. Sylvia recovered, primarily owing to Kenny's careful attention during that transport. Kenny improved the stretcher for use by local ambulance services, and {{for the next three years}} marketed it as the [...] "Sylvia Stretcher" [...] in Australia, Europe and the United States. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> profits over to the Australian Country Women's Association, which administered its sales and manufacturing.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1965, {{an article}} was {{published}} involving an antique oak rocking chair {{said to have}} been previously owned by attorney Charlie Willett, a Bell descendant. The rocking chair was recently sold in an estate sale to Mrs. J. C. Adams, owner of an antique store on U.S. 41. A customer sat down in the chair, after learning it was not for sale, and while rocking in the chair asked Mrs. Adams if she believed in the supernatural. Two weeks later, the customer's daughter visited the home of Mrs. Adams and said after her mother had left and visited the Bell cemetery a voice told her to [...] "stand up and look around, you will find something of much value." [...] After some car trouble, the woman walked out into a field and found a black iron kettle turned over. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> kettle over and found a pearl buckle in the grass.

2500|$|When casting {{about for}} the role of Norma Desmond for the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard, Billy Wilder offered West the role. Still smarting from the {{censorship}} debacle of The Heat's On, [...] and the constraints placed on her characterization, she declined. The theme of the Wilder film, she noted, [...] was pure pathos, while her brand of comedy was always [...] "about uplifting the audience". [...] Mae West had a unique comic character that was timeless, in the same way Charlie Chaplin did. After Mary Pickford also declined the role, Gloria Swanson was cast. In subsequent years, West was offered the role of Vera Simpson, opposite Marlon Brando, in the 1957 film adaptation of Pal Joey, which she turned down, with the role going to Rita Hayworth. [...] In 1964, West was offered a leading role in Roustabout, starring Elvis Presley. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> role down, and Barbara Stanwyck was cast in her place. West was also approached for roles in Frederico Fellini's Juliet of the Spirits and Satyricon, but rejected both offers.|$|E

2500|$|The role of DS Ellie Miller was {{the second}} role cast. Producer Jane Featherstone first {{suggested}} Olivia Colman {{for the role of}} Ellie Miller, to which Chibnall (having also had her in mind) immediately agreed. Chibnall then specifically wrote the role of Ellie Miller for Colman, hoping she would agree to join the cast. Colman remained Chibnall's first choice to play Miller, and there was consensus among the producers to offer the job to her without the need for an audition. Colman says she was immediately drawn to the role: [...] "From the off I really liked the idea of the story, a hard story and an upsetting one, but I liked the idea of a whole community being affected by something and I liked the character of Ellie. ... And I liked Ellie. I find it hard to play a character if I can't feel any of me in them. Especially {{if you are going to}} be playing that person through the whole series you need to feel that connection." [...] She was also highly impressed with the script she read, calling the script one she [...] "couldn't put down" [...] and that <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> pages [...] "frantically" [...] because it was such a good read. Colman says she also had heard that David Tennant and actress Vicky McClure were under consideration for roles as well, and she wanted very much to work with them. She accepted the role immediately after reading the script.|$|E
2500|$|On December 14, 1946, 26 {{year old}} Anne Louise Certain {{attended}} the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. She went backstage after the performance {{to meet some}} of the performers including Scruggs, who had been with Bill Monroe's band about a year at that time. [...] Scruggs and Certain began dating and fell in love. They were married {{about a year and a}} half later in April 1948. When Flatt and Scruggs formed the new group, Scruggs had done most of the bookings for the band, but being on the road for hours in a car and stopping at a phone booth to communicate with venues, often at odd hours, was difficult. Louise had a business aptitude and began helping by doing the phone work. She eventually became the [...] booking agent and ultimately the group's manager, Nashville's first female to become prominent in that role. Her acumen and skills in the job were prescient. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> band into TV personalities, and helped propel them into what today would be called rock stars, touring with Joan Baez and performing at the prestigious Newport Folk Festival. [...] She recruited noted artist Thomas B. Allen, who had done covers for The New Yorker and Sports Illustrated to create cover illustrations for 17 of the group's albums. She helped market the group to younger audiences at college campuses and arranged a live album to be recorded at Carnegie Hall. Earl Scruggs said, [...] "What talent I had never would have peaked without her. She helped shape music up as a business, instead of just people out picking and grinning". [...] Louise died on February 2, 2006 at age 78, predeceasing her husband by six years. [...] In 2007, The Country Music Hall of Fame created The Louise Scruggs Memorial Forum, an annual event to honor a music industry business leader.|$|E
