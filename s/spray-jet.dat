40|$|The {{physical}} and mathematical {{model of the}} crystallization process of liquid aluminum particles in the <b>spray-jet</b> of the ejection-type atomizer was proposed. The results of mathematical modeling of two-phase flow in the <b>spray-jet</b> and the crystallization process of fluid particles are given. The influence of the particle size, of the flow rate and the stagnation temperature gas in the ranges of industrial technology implemented {{for the production of}} powders aluminum of brands ASD, on the crystallization characteristics were investigated. The approximations of the characteristics of the crystallization process {{depending on the size of}} the aluminum particles on the basis of two approaches to the mathematical description of the process of crystallization of aluminum particles were obtained. The results allow to optimize the process parameters of ejection-type atomizer to produce aluminum particles with given morphology...|$|E
40|$|Surface-enhanced {{resonance}} Raman (SERR) spectroscopy {{was used}} to characterize compounds separated by column liquid chromatography (LC). Three percent of the effluent from a conventional-size LC column were immobilized on a moving thinlayer chromatography (TLC) plate using a <b>spray-jet</b> solvent-elimination interface. Next, colloidal silver {{was applied to the}} analyte spots and in situ SERR spectra were recorded with a multichannel micro-Raman spectrometer. Storage of the LC effluent avoids the need to use a continuous flow of colloidal silver and, in principle allows compounds to be detected independently of LC conditions like eluent composition and flow rate. Using dyes as test compounds, the method was optimized and aspects were studied such as type of TLC plate, LC separation of the dyes, preservation of LC integrity during immobilization, and SERR analysis of the deposited compounds. With a silica TLC plate as deposition substrate, good-quality and characteristic SERR spectra were obtained for the dyes which were separated on a cyanoproyl-modified silica LC column with methanol-water containing the volatile additives ammonium acetate and triethylamine as eluent. The minimum identifiable concentration of the dyes was about 250 ng m...|$|E
40|$|The {{understanding}} and quantification of hydrodynamic lift requires a full {{appreciation of the}} phenomena associated with high-speed planing. Repeatability of results {{is a major problem}} with planing craft experiments due to the complexity of fluid flows; wetted lengths, for example, are difficult to measure because of the obscurity created by <b>spray-jets.</b> This difficulty in measurement can produce subjective interpretation. Therefore, reducing hydrodynamic lift using uncertainly defined factors, such as wetted data, can be misleading. This paper outlines an experimental method, Computer Vision Data Acquisition (CVDA), that can remove questions of uncertainty regarding dynamic phenomena by remotely capturing large amounts of planing data for immediate and archival use. An example of the importance of this form of data capture and analysis is described by the ability to validate predictive formulae for planing performance in calm water, and to further advance these formulae for predictions outside their designed realms: in waves...|$|R
