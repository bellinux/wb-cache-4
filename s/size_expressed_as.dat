We therefore hypothesised that apelin peptides may protect the post-ischaemic myocardium from reperfusion injury via activation of the RISK pathway and tested this hypothesis in a rat isolated heart model of ischaemia and reperfusion. Hearts from anaesthetised male Sprague–Dawley rats (290 – 350 g) were excised and retrogradely perfused via the ascending aorta with oxygenated Krebs' buffer at 37 °C.
