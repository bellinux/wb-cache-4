40|$|AbstractAs {{a part of}} a {{consortium}} study, we analyzed the Martian meteorite Yamato (Y) 000097 by prompt gamma-ray analysis, instrumental neutron activation analysis, and instrumental photon activation analysis. For comparison, we also analyzed Allan Hills (ALH) 77005 using the same methods. The data confirm that Y 000097 belongs to lherzolitic <b>shergottites</b> in terms of chemical composition. Although there exist slight differences in elemental abundances among lherzolitic <b>shergottites</b> due to differences in the modal abundances of constituent minerals, they have essentially the same chemical compositions, suggesting they are genetically related and experienced similar formation histories. Zr/Hf ratios obtained for Y 000097 and ALH 77005 are subchondritic, consistent with values reported for other lherzolitic <b>shergottites</b> and olivine-phyric <b>shergottites.</b> Such fractionation can be explained by invoking clinopyroxene, ilmenite, or majorite in the petrogenesis of the shergottites' source material. CI-normalized Hf/Sm ratios obtained for Y 000097 and ALH 77005 are 1. 52 and 1. 37, respectively, consistent with superchondritic Hf/Sm ratios reported for <b>shergottites.</b> Based on experimentally derived partition coefficients, majorite is the best candidate mineral for the fractionation of Hf and Sm in <b>shergottites...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Among these, {{the famous}} {{specimen}} Allan Hills 84001 {{has a different}} rock type than other Martian meteorites: it is an orthopyroxenite (an igneous rock dominantly composed of orthopyroxene). For this reason it is classified within its own group, the [...] "OPX Martian meteorites". This meteorite received much attention after an electron microscope revealed structures that {{were considered to be}} the fossilized remains of bacteria-like lifeforms. , scientific consensus was that the microfossils were not indicative of Martian life, but of contamination by earthly biofilms. ALH 84001 is as old as the basaltic and intermediate <b>shergottite</b> groups — i.e., 4.1 billion years old.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, {{it was obvious}} that the SNC group of meteorites (Shergottites, Nakhlites, Chassignites) were {{significantly}} different from most other meteorite types. Among these differences were younger formation ages, a different oxygen isotopic composition, the presence of aqueous weathering products, and some similarity in chemical composition to analyses of the Martian surface rocks in 1976 by the Viking landers. Several scientists suggested these characteristics implied the origin of SNC meteorites from a relatively large parent body, possibly Mars (e.g., Smith et al. and Treiman et al.). Then in 1983, various trapped gases were reported in impact-formed glass of the EET79001 <b>shergottite,</b> gases which closely resembled those in the Martian atmosphere as analyzed by Viking. These trapped gases provided direct evidence for a Martian origin. In 2000, an article by Treiman, Gleason and Bogard gave a survey of all the arguments used to conclude the SNC meteorites (of which 14 had been found at the time) were from Mars. They wrote, [...] "There seems little likelihood that the SNCs are not from Mars. If they were from another planetary body, {{it would have to be}} substantially identical to Mars as it now is understood." ...|$|E

40|$|Recently, several basaltic <b>shergottites</b> {{have been}} found that include {{magnesian}} olivines as a major minerals. These have been called olivinephyric <b>shergottites.</b> Yamato 980459, which is a new martian meteorite recovered from the Antarctica by the Japanese Antarctic expedition, is one of them.

Differences in absolute REE abundances between bulk samples of these meteorites can be largely accounted for by sample heterogeneity. The three lherzolites were formed by essentially identical processes and they may even have originated from the same lithological unit on Mars. Preservation of major element zonation in olivines of Y 79 indicates that it is less equilibrated than the other lherzolitic <b>shergottites,</b> and may have crystallized at shallower depth. The parent magmas of lherzolitic <b>shergottites,</b> like those of other <b>shergottites,</b> were derived by partial melting of a partly depleted martian mantle...|$|R
40|$|A model-based {{argument}} is made {{that there is}} a plausible relationship between the <b>shergottites</b> and the other SNCs which implies that the former contain an igneous component that is both young and mantle-derived.

40|$|Magnetic {{properties}} of 26 (of 32) unpaired Martian meteorites (SNCs) are synthesized to further constrain the lithology carrying Martian magnetic crustal sources. Magnetic {{properties of}} ultramafic cumulates (i. e., Chassigny, Allan Hills [ALH] 84001) and lherzolitic <b>shergottites</b> (ALH 77005, Lewis Cliff [LEW] 88516) are {{one or two}} orders of magnitude too weak {{to account for the}} crustal magnetizations, assuming magnetization in an Earth-like field.

40|$|Martian basalts can be {{classified}} {{in at least two}} geochemically different families: enriched and depleted <b>shergottites.</b> Enriched <b>shergottites</b> are characterized by higher incompatible element concentrations and initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and lower initial 143 Nd/ 144 Nd and 176 Hf/ 177 Hf than depleted <b>shergottites.</b> It is now generally admitted that <b>shergottites</b> result from the melting of at least two distinct mantle reservoirs. Some of the olivine-phyric <b>shergottites</b> (either depleted or enriched), the most magnesian Martian basalts, could represent primitive melts, which are of considerable interest to constrain mantle sources. Two depleted olivine-phyric <b>shergottites,</b> Yamato 980459 and Nothwest Africa (NWA) 5789, are in equilibrium with their most magnesian olivine and their bulk rock compositions are inferred to represent primitive melts. Larkman Nunatak 06319 and NWA 1068, the most magnesian enriched basalts, have bulk Mg# that are too high to be in equilibrium with their olivine megacryst cores. Parental melt compositions have been estimated by subtracting the most magnesian olivine from the bulk rock composition, assuming that olivine megacrysts have partially accumulated. However, because this technique does not account for the actual petrography of these meteorites, we used image analysis to study these rocks history, reconstruct their parent magma and understand the nature of oli-vine megacrysts. Our image analysis results are supported by a series of high-pressure experiments performed on LAR 06319 bulk rock composition to test if it could represent a primitive melt, and understand its crystallization history...|$|R
40|$|The {{water content}} of the martian mantle is controversial. In particular, the role {{of water in the}} {{petrogenesis}} of the <b>shergottites</b> has been much debated. Although the <b>shergottites,</b> collectively, contain very little water [e. g., 1, 2], some experiments have been interpreted to show that percent levels of water are required for the petrogenesis of <b>shergottites</b> such as Shergotty and Zagami [3]. In this latter interpretation, the general paucity of water in the <b>shergottites</b> and their constituent minerals is attributed to late-stage degassing. Y 980459 (Y 98) is a very primitive, perhaps even parental, martian basalt, with a one-bar liquidus temperature of approx. 1400 C. Olivine is the liquidus phase, and olivine core compositions are in equilibrium with the bulk rock [e. g., 4]. Petrogenetically, therefore, Y 98 has had a rather simple history and can potentially help constrain the role of water in martian igneous processes. In particular, once trapped, melt inclusions should not be affected by subsequent degassing...|$|R

Significant bulk carbonate was confirmed in Nakhla and trace carbonate was confirmed for EETA 79001, all of {{which seems to be}} preterrestrial in origin. Chlorine in <b>shergottites</b> and Nakhla is found to covary with oxidized sulfur, whereas carbonate and sulfate are related inversely.

40|$|Shock {{metamorphism}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} fundamental processes in the history of Martian meteorites. Especially, <b>shergottites</b> experienced strong shock effects (> 30 GPa) most likely when they were ejected from Mars. "Maskelynitization" of plagioclase and formation of shock melts are major effects due to this severe shock. QUE 94201 (QUE) and Dhofar 378 (DHO) are basaltic <b>shergottites</b> that are mainly composed of pyroxene and plagioclase glass. These two <b>shergottites</b> suffered severe shock, which generated abundant impact melt and vesiculated flow textures. In spite of similar degrees of shock between two meteorites, they are distinct in several mineralogical aspects.

25|$|The {{majority}} of SNC meteorites are quite young compared to most other meteorites {{and seem to}} imply that volcanic activity was present on Mars {{only a few hundred}} million years ago. The young formation ages of Martian meteorites was one of the early recognized characteristics that suggested their origin from a planetary body such as Mars. Among Martian meteorites, only ALH 84001 and NWA 7034 have radiometric ages older than about 1400 Ma (Ma = million years). All nakhlites, as well as Chassigny and NWA 2737, give similar if not identical formation ages around 1300 Ma, as determined by various radiometric dating techniques. Formation ages determined for many <b>shergottites</b> are variable and much younger, mostly ~150-575 Ma. The chronological history of <b>shergottites</b> is not totally understood, and a few scientists have suggested that some may actually have formed prior to the times given by their radiometric ages, a suggestion not accepted by most scientists. Formation ages of SNC meteorites are often linked to their cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages, as measured from the nuclear products of interactions of the meteorite in space with energetic cosmic ray particles. Thus, all measured nakhlites give essentially identical CRE ages of approximately 11 Ma, which when combined with their possible identical formation ages indicates ejection of nakhlites into space from a single location on Mars by a single impact event. Some of the <b>shergottites</b> also seem to form distinct groups according to their CRE ages and formation ages, again indicating ejection of several different <b>shergottites</b> from Mars by a single impact. However, CRE ages of <b>shergottites</b> vary considerably (~0.5-19 Ma), and several impact events are required to eject all the known <b>shergottites.</b> It had been asserted that there are no large young craters on Mars that are candidates as sources for the Martian meteorites, but subsequent studies claimed to have a likely source for ALH 84001 and a possible source for other <b>shergottites.</b>|$|R
