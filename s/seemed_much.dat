5|$|In September, Alexander {{believed}} {{that he would make}} his final selection with a December verbal commitment and an April signing of his National Letter of Intent. On October 7, the Hoophall Classic schedule was announced and Curie was scheduled to play Montverde Academy on January 20. By some accounts Kansas was a favorite because his girlfriend was a student at Kansas and the 2013–14 Kansas Jayhawks were scheduled to play the 2013–14 Duke Blue Devils at Chicago's United Center in the ESPN Champions Classic on November 12 just before his scheduled announcement. In 2013 Caelynn Manning-Allen became a freshman on the Kansas women's basketball team. However, Illinois was very excited to be in serious contention for Alexander. It was the first time since Derrick Rose in 2006 that a top 5 prospect was still considering Illinois so late into his senior year and Alexander's level of interest <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> higher than Rose's. Following his Illinois visit, his scheduled announcement date had moved forward to November 15. On October 31, Alexander officially eliminated Michigan State from his candidate list, leaving Kansas, Illinois, DePaul and Memphis in contention.|$|E

Harry owned a jewelry store in Peoria, and Miriam {{wrote for the}} society page of a newspaper when Friedan's father fell ill. Her mother's new life outside the home <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> more gratifying.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{amount of}} medieval {{literature}} is anonymous. This {{is not only}} {{due to the lack}} of documents from a period, but also due to an interpretation of the author's role that differs considerably from the romantic interpretation of the term in use today. Medieval authors often deeply respected the classical writers and the Church Fathers and tended to re-tell and embellish stories they had heard or read rather than invent new stories. And even when they did, they often claimed to be handing down something from an auctor instead. From this point of view, the names of the individual authors <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> less important, and therefore many important works were never attributed to any specific person.|$|E

25|$|The Graham Kennedy Show {{began in}} February 1960 {{but was not}} popular in Sydney. The program was judged stilted {{compared}} to IMT itself; Kennedy <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> more subdued than usual, was tense, and the comedy was not working. Critics in Sydney and Queensland disliked key components of the show. Judged as a flop, The Graham Kennedy Show in Sydney was dropped by ATN7 after 13 weeks. The program however was immediately picked up by TCN9 – its general manager Ken G. Hall saw potential in the program. After continued bad reviews its popularity increased in Sydney. By July 1960 it had reached its twenty-fifth episode and had the highest ratings in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Food {{security}} {{indicators and}} measures {{are derived from}} country level household income and expenditure surveys to estimate per capita caloric availability. In general the objective of food security indicators and measures is to capture {{some or all of}} the main components of food security in terms of food availability, access and utilization or adequacy. While availability (production and supply) and utilization/adequacy (nutritional status/anthropometric measures) <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> easier to estimate, thus more popular, access (ability to acquire sufficient quantity and quality) remain largely elusive. The factors influencing household food access are often context specific. Thus the financial and technical demands of collecting and analyzing data on all aspects of household's experience of food access and the development of valid and clear measures remain a huge challenge.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{remained}} with No. 130 Squadron {{for the rest}} of his service, flying with it to Copenhagen, and then, via Britain, to Norway. He spent around five months in Norway as part of the post-war occupation forces, but did not learn Norwegian, later telling Berlyn that it <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> harder to him than Italian, [...] "and they all spoke English, you see". After No. 130 Squadron returned to Britain in November 1945, Smith was demobilised and sent home. He was met at RAF Kumalo in Bulawayo by his family, with whom he drove back to Selukwe.|$|E

500|$|These critiques {{were not}} taken seriously by AI researchers, often because they seemed {{so far off}} the point. Problems like intractability and commonsense {{knowledge}} <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> more immediate and serious. It was unclear what difference [...] "know how" [...] or [...] "intentionality" [...] made to an actual computer program. Minsky said of Dreyfus and Searle [...] "they misunderstand, and should be ignored." [...] Dreyfus, who taught at MIT, was given a cold shoulder: he later said that AI researchers [...] "dared not be seen having lunch with me." [...] Joseph Weizenbaum, the author of ELIZA, felt his colleagues' treatment of Dreyfus was unprofessional and childish. Although he was {{an outspoken critic of}} Dreyfus' positions, he [...] "deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Bertram Davis, [...] "For {{every person}} who remembers Sir John Hawkins {{as the author of}} the first {{full-length}} biography of Samuel Johnson, many remember him as the man Johnson once described as 'unclubable'." [...] Although [...] "unclubable" [...] reflects Hawkins's relationship with others of Johnson's circle, Johnson and Hawkins had a close friendship as Miss Reynolds describes: [...] "As we were returning from the meadows that day, I remember we met Sir John Hawkins, whom Dr. Johnson <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> rejoiced to see; and no wonder, for I have often heard him speak of Sir John in terms expressive of great esteem and much cordiality of friendship" [...] Their relationship began around 1739 and they were both involved with The Gentleman's Magazine. Later, Hawkins was, in 1749, a member of Johnson's first club: the Ivy Lane club.|$|E
500|$|He took a boat {{to inspect}} the {{destruction}} around Pudding Lane at close range and describes a [...] "lamentable" [...] fire, [...] "everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into the river or bringing them into lighters that lay off; poor people staying in their houses as long as till the very fire touched them, and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair of stairs by the water-side to another." [...] Pepys continued westward on the river to the court at Whitehall, [...] "where people come about me, and did give them an account dismayed them all, and word was carried in to the King. So I was called for, and did tell the King and Duke of Yorke what I saw, and that unless His Majesty did command houses to be pulled down nothing could stop the fire. They <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> troubled, and the King commanded {{me to go to}} my Lord Mayor from him, and command him to spare no houses, but to pull down before the fire every way." [...] Charles' brother James, Duke of York offered the use of the Royal Life Guards to help fight the fire.|$|E

500|$|Wadsworths {{first summer}} {{overseas}} {{proved to be}} the most eventful period of her wartime service. She sighted her first U-boat on 18May, less than two weeks after she began patrols out of Queenstown. Though the destroyer sped to the attack, the submarine dove and escaped. Three days later, Wadsworth picked up some survivors from [...] which had been torpedoed and sunk the preceding day. On 7June, the destroyer caught a glimpse of another enemy submarine just before it submerged and escaped. Between 24 and 27June, Wadsworth served as part of the escort for the first American troop convoy to reach Europe. Though she scored no definitely provable successes against German submarines, the destroyer made depth charge attacks on four separate occasions in July and a gunfire attack in one other instance. The first two depth-charge attacks, on 10 and 11July, returned no results whatsoever, and the gun attack on 20July was similarly unrewarding. However, after sighting a double periscope the following day, Wadsworth made another depth-charge attack. During that attack, one of the explosions <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> stronger than those from the other charges she dropped. Moreover, a patch of reddish-brown material rose to the surface. Although it seemed certain that the destroyer had damaged a submarine, no conclusive evidence was found to prove this possibility.|$|E
2500|$|A good {{vehicle for}} {{analysis}} is the 1923 Benz Diesel Lastkraftwagen 5K3. The truck was notable for being Mercedes Benz's first diesel. The model is {{five and a}} half inches long, and made of a sturdy, rather heavy styrene type plastic that seems heavier than the styrene plastic used by American companies AMT or Jo-Han, the American promotional model and kit makers. It is also much more solid than most French Minialuxe models or early Brumm carriages and steam vehicles which <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> more 'spidery' and delicate in the use of their plastic.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} Finno-Ugric {{linguistic}} affinity became widely accepted after extensive public debate. [...] Some Magyar scientists (e.g. orientalist Ármin Vámbéry) and intellectuals (e.g. Arany János and Jókai Mór) were unable to accept that the Hungarian nation had family relations in Northern Europe. To them, relationships with the [...] Hun or Turkic peoples <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> more plausible, mainly in the years of the Hungarian millennium around 1896. At this time the Finnish people, living in Tsarist Russia, were receptive to the idea of Finno-Ugric affinity and regarded the proud and freedom-loving Hungarian nation as an ideal.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{years later}} she reprised her role as Kay Adams in The Godfather Part II. She was {{initially}} reluctant, stating that, [...] "At first, I was skeptical about playing Kay again in the Godfather sequel. But when I read the script, the character <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> more substantial than in the first movie." [...] In Part II, her character changed dramatically, becoming more embittered about her husband's activities. Even though Keaton received widespread exposure from the films, her character's importance was minimal. Time wrote that she was [...] "invisible in The Godfather and pallid in The Godfather, Part II." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Shu Ji (蜀記; Records of Shu) by Wang Yin (王隱), {{when the}} state of Shu Han (founded by Liu Bei) was conquered {{by the state of}} Cao Wei in 263, the Wei general Zhong Hui had Pang De's body transported from Shu to Ye (鄴; in present-day Handan, Hebei) in Wei territory. Pang De <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> alive inside the tomb. However, Pei Songzhi, who {{annotated}} Pang De's biography in the Sanguozhi, dismissed this account as nonsense. He wrote: [...] "Pang De died in Fancheng. After Cao Pi ascended the throne, he sent an emissary to read out an imperial edict at Pang De's tomb, so Pang's body should not be in Shu. What Wang Yin wrote was nonsense." ...|$|E
2500|$|Next was Olympic silver {{medalist}} John Mugabi of Uganda, who was 25–0 with 25 knockouts and was ranked {{the number one}} contender by all three major bodies. The fight took place on March 10, 1986 as Hagler had hurt his back and could not fight {{on the first date}} booked in 1985. Hagler stopped Mugabi in the 11th round of a brutal fight. Many ringside observers, including analyst Gil Clancy, noticed that Hagler was showing signs of advanced ring wear and age. [...] He was much slower of hand and foot and <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> easier to hit. He had also completely morphed his ring style from a slick, quick-fisted, boxer/puncher to a strictly flat-footed, stalking, slugger to compensate for his loss of speed and reflexes. Hagler was now said to be seriously considering retirement. Hagler's promoter Bob Arum was quoted as saying he was expecting Hagler to retire in the face of being challenged by Sugar Ray Leonard.|$|E

2500|$|When {{approaching}} about 32 NMs {{from the}} airfield, the Captain directed the co-pilot to ask again for latest weather as the ATC had reported [...] visibility earlier while the weather being shown on weather radar <b>seemed</b> <b>much</b> worse. The crew discussed {{a way to}} go through / in between / around the weather. The co-pilot was also again heard exclaiming about the huge size of the cell/severe weather, seen on their weather radar. The co-pilot also suggested to wait and orbit for 10 minutes as the cell could be observed to be moving already, but the Captain did not respond to the suggestion. The Captain visually spotted the runway at 12:54. The Over speed Audio warning is audible on the CVR in 12:55 as the flaps were being lowered in excess of permissible speed. At 12:56:21, sound similar to rain falling on the cockpit was picked up on the CVR. Rain falling on the windscreen is audible on the CVR till end of recording.|$|E
