This penalty function is based <b>on</b> the due <b>date</b> <b>value</b> and <b>on</b> the earliness or the lateness of each job in the selected sequence. The main objective {{is to determine the}} optimal value of this due date and an optimal sequence to minimize a total penalty function. We prove that the optimal due date result can be generalized to the parallel machine problem. The problem of simultaneously available jobs on several parallel and identical machines. The problem is to find the optimal due date, assuming this to be the same for all jobs and we present a simple heuristic to find an approximate solution.

After documenting the passage of time, calculating differences in time came next. Calculating this passage of time using dates, times and datetimes in SAS ® can seem intimidating at first, however, after learning a few tips and tricks, this task can be invigorating and, some might say, fun!
