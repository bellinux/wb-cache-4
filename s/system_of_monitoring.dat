25|$|The {{government}} broadened {{land ownership}} by returning land {{that had been}} sold to large landowners in the late Ming period by families unable to pay the land tax. To give people more incentives {{to participate in the}} market, they reduced the tax burden in comparison with the late Ming, and replaced the corvée system with a head tax used to hire laborers. The administration of the Grand Canal was made more efficient, and transport opened to private merchants. A <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>monitoring</b> grain prices eliminated severe shortages, and enabled the price of rice to rise slowly and smoothly through the 18th century. Wary of the power of wealthy merchants, Qing rulers limited their trading licenses and usually refused them permission to open new mines, except in poor areas. These restrictions on domestic resource exploration, as well as on foreign trade, are held by some scholars as a cause of the Great Divergence, by which the Western world overtook China economically.|$|E
2500|$|Fisheries {{management}} is {{the activity of}} protecting fishery resources so sustainable exploitation is possible, drawing on fisheries science, and including the precautionary principle.

However, the working definition used by the FAO and much cited elsewhere is: The integrated process of information gathering, analysis, planning, consultation, decision-making, allocation of resources and formulation and implementation, with enforcement as necessary, of regulations or rules which govern fisheries activities in order to ensure the continued productivity of the resources and the accomplishment of other fisheries objectives.|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{continuous}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> {{the technical}} condition of structures is {{in most cases}} reduced to control over indicators compared {{to a set of}} limit values. The monitoring system alerts responsible officers about the facts within or beyond permissible limits and saves files that contain the measurement data. Generally, data analysis is non-automated and carried out post factum rather than in the real-time mode. <b>Systems</b> <b>of</b> continuous <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> the technical condition of structures need improved data monitoring, analysis and storage processes as well as the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> their immediate retrieval. Besides, the above procedures need a thorough assessment. Obviously, any advancement of technologies improves data processing (data collection, analysis, storage, presentation); therefore, issues <b>of</b> <b>monitoring</b> and operation <b>of</b> a sustainable <b>system</b> are to attain a new level. The information support <b>of</b> the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> continuous <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> the technical condition of structures is viewed from the perspective of Information Flow Processing (IFP) and SCADAsystems. Contemporary SCADA-systems are widely used to control and manage the industrial environment of plants and factories. Peculiarities <b>of</b> the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> continuous <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> the technical condition of structures consist in the fact that this system does not produce any direct influence on the subject under control. Undoubtedly, certain features <b>of</b> the SCADA <b>system</b> architecture (alert generation, integration with DBMS) might be considered in the course <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> continuous <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> the technical condition <b>of</b> structures. <b>Systems</b> <b>of</b> continuous <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> the technical condition of structures process basic interconnected monitoring events and generate more complex ones. Thus, the behavior of structures exposed to diverse influences may be considered in a new perspective. It is obvious that <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> continuous <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> the technical condition of structures require a data warehouse responsible for managing complex events, data storage and presentation.
