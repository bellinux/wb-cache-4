40|$|Since {{the last}} decade of the twentieth century, the Spanish port {{infrastructures}} cataloged of general interest has undergone a series of political, economic and social transformations that result in a significant change in the classic paradigms of port management. In this <b>sense,</b> <b>port</b> security has become one of the most relevant aspects of management. This article aims, from the descriptive analysis, to determine the configurator factors and dimensions of a singular scenario of public action, public security policies and port protection. This public policy has its special significance today, as it emerges and consolidates as a subspace that is strongly characteristic of public security policies and which, in turn, derives from a scope of post-governmental management of converging governance...|$|E

2500|$|When the Uhlan gear was {{incorporated}} in the Mark 14 design, the pressure <b>sensing</b> <b>port</b> for the depth mechanism was moved from its position on the cylindrical body to the cone-shaped tail section; the designers {{did not realize that}} move would affect the pressure readings. This repositioning meant that when the torpedo was moving, a hydrodynamic flow effect created a substantially lower pressure at the port than hydrostatic depth pressure. [...] The torpedo's depth control engine therefore thought the torpedo was too shallow depth and responded by trimming the torpedo to run deeper. A laboratory test (such as immersing a non-moving torpedo in a pool of water) would not be subject to the flow-induced pressure change and would show the torpedo trimmed at the desired depth. Dynamic tests using exercise heads with depth and roll recorders would have shown the depth problem, but the depth measuring port suffered from the same placement problem and gave consistent (though incorrect) measurements. The problem was also exacerbated by higher speeds. The depth problem was finally addressed in the last half of 1943 by relocating the sensor point to the midbody of the torpedo where hydrodynamic effects were minimized.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss the port of Antwerp’s {{sustainability}} reporting initiative, reporting on the joint performance of the harbour community, {{as a process of}} co-production. By means of ‘stakeholder elicitation’ and in interaction with the port’s sustainability reporting initiative we investigated potentially meaningful indicators (mainly qualitative in nature) for environmental nuisance and citizen participation as aspects of responsible care. Reflecting on this work, we argue that such initiatives not only produce new sustainability indicators and standards, but also encourage dialogue through which identities are formed and a <b>sense</b> of (<b>port)</b> community is established...|$|R
40|$|The {{specifications}} for the Stand Alone Pressure Measurement Device (SAPMD) are as follows: the SAPMD shall measure ambient pressure {{at the surface}} of the Orbiter TPS in the range of 0 to 15 pounds per square inch absolute (PSIA). Measurement will begin at solid rocket booster (SRB) ignition as sensed by appropriate vibration sensing elements in the SAPMD. Pressure and corresponding real-time data are to be recorded every one tenth second for 140 seconds {{and at the end of}} the recording period, the operation will be discontinued with the data preserved for interrogation subsequent to Orbiter re-entry and landing. The type and size of the battery shall be such as to allow the vibration sensing elements and a real-time clock to be initialized a minimum of 30 day prior to launch and still provide power as necessary to perform the 140 second data recording period after SRB ignition. Battery installation shall be in such a manner as to allow battery replacement without removing the SAPMD from its position or removing more than one TPS tile. The SAPMD must be mounted in specific locations under tile of the TPS. To accommodate such mounting, the absolute maximum physical dimensions much not exceed 6. 0 inches in length, 1. 5 inches in width, and 0. 4 inches in height, and the device shall be of such configuration that it can be bonded to the Orbiter skin at the joint line of two TPS tiles with the pressure <b>sensing</b> <b>port</b> at {{the surface of the}} tile. The SAPMD must remain operational in the temperature range of - 40 to + 85 C and survive storage temperature of - 55 to + 125 C. The pressure port must withstand 934 C without causing damage to the TPS during entry and must remain functional at 262 C during ascent. The accuracy of the pressure measurement must be plus or minus one-half PSIA over a temperature range of 0 to + 36 C. All the specifications were met and verified by prototype testing and documented in the enclosed test data. Four flight-qualified models were fabricated and of these, two were delivered and successfully flown in the cargo bay of STS- 26...|$|R
40|$|Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} com- mon and in the {{frequency}} increasing diseases in the western world. In- testinal metaplasia, or Barrett s Esophagus, is a precancerous conditi- on and complication of GERD. A large interobserver variation is known in histopathology of Barrett s Esophagus. Hence, it makes <b>sense</b> to sup- <b>port</b> pathologists with an automated pre-analysis of the images.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} problem of {{preventing}} biological invasions caused by ships transporting internationally traded goods between countries and continents. Specifically, we ask the following question: Should a port manager have {{a small number of}} inspectors inspect arriving ships less stringently or should this manager have a large number of inspectors inspect the same ships more stringently? We use a simple queuing-theoretic framework and show that if decreasing the economic cost of regulation is very important then it makes more <b>sense</b> for the <b>port</b> manager to choose the less stringent inspection regime. In contrast, if reducing the damage from biological invasions is more salient then the port manager ought to pick the more stringent inspection regime. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{variable}} displacement axial piston pump with Pressure compensator and Load Sensing control is coupled to a diesel engine. The pump {{is in an}} open circuit topology for load control in a typical excavator, skid-steer or front loader circuit. The active torque generated by the engine is subject to overloads, due to uncontrolled priority and sum of torque requests from hydrostatic transmission, implements and upper-structure control. In order to avoid engine overload a third 2 ways proportional valve {{is added to the}} control circuit. The valve controls the delivery pressure on the load <b>sensing</b> valve <b>port,</b> and the pressure is managed by an electronic system. This circuit architecture allow the designer to use the valve as a variable load sensing system, modifying the load sensing differential pressure depending on working conditions. The control must be in real time and a feed forward control based on the valve characteristic map is useful and helpful but a feedback control is needed to correct the steady state error; a PID and a Sliding mode are superimposed, in order to react to high dynamic transient. The controls runs properly on the bench and the advantages are: more engine efficiency and continuously working capacity, adapting load sensing pressure a more efficient use of power is possible...|$|R
30|$|To {{understand}} {{the impact of}} the first technique we did one hundred simulation runs, 10 minutes each, of the network with different BO settings (from BO = 8 up to BO = 12), simulating a larger network, with the initial scheduling and using the cluster re-ordering technique. The maximum end-to-end delays were measured for packets transmitted from a Sensing Node associated to Router 0 x 0004, at Depth 4, (S 3 in Figure 1), to the PAN-Coordinator, with no extra traffic on the network. This transmission is the worst-case for the initial TDCS schedule. In the simulation platform, frame size was set to 800 bits, and Packet Inter-arrival Time was set to 0, 06 seconds to emulate the arrival of Sensing Data at the <b>Sensing</b> Node’s serial <b>port</b> (this was verified experimentally).|$|R
2500|$|The {{last two}} V8's, the T and the 100hp were not successful. [...] Though tested, they never flew. [...] The type T {{introduced}} steel cylinders {{and was an}} overhead-valve engine with vertically mounted valves operated from a central camshaft by thin pull rods and rockers. [...] The carburettor was mounted centrally at the front, feeding a central tube which ran {{to the back of}} the engine, divided and ran back along each cylinder bank. Dual magneto/coil and battery ignition was provided. [...] The 100hp engine was also an overhead-valve engine in the <b>sense</b> that the <b>port</b> opened directly into the cylinder head, though the valves were mounted horizontally. [...] This arrangement required an unusual shape of combustion chamber but enabled the valves to be operated directly from a central crankshaft raised on pillars to cylinder head height. Vibrations of this crankshaft and weakness of a new cylinder head restraint system dogged the engine, the last E.N.V. made.|$|R
40|$|A high-angle-of-attack flush airdata {{sensing system}} was {{installed}} and flight tested on the F- 18 High Alpha Research Vehicle at NASA-Dryden. This system uses {{a matrix of}} pressure orifices arranged in concentric circles on {{the nose of the}} vehicle to determine angles of attack, angles of sideslip, dynamic pressure, and static pressure as well as other airdata parameters. Results presented use an arrangement of 11 symmetrically distributed ports on the aircraft nose. Experience with this sensing system data indicates that the primary concern for real-time implementation is the detection and management of overall system and individual pressure sensor failures. The multiple <b>port</b> <b>sensing</b> system is more tolerant to small disturbances in the measured pressure data than conventional probe-based intrusive airdata systems. However, under adverse circumstances, large undetected failures in individual pressure ports can result in algorithm divergence and catastrophic failure of the entire system. How system and individual port failures may be detected using chi sq. analysis is shown. Once identified, the effects of failures are eliminated using weighted least squares...|$|R
40|$|Between {{the end of}} {{the eighteenth}} and the {{beginning}} of the nineteenth century, it was the blood-red flag of the Omanis that formed a tie, and not merely in the figurative <b>sense,</b> between the <b>ports</b> of Makran-Baluchistan, the principal ports of Oman itself, and the ports along the Swahili coast from Mogadishu to Kilwa. This short note aims to re-read Baluch presence during nineteenth century’s Swahili coast during the ‘apogee’ with the ‘Arabs’ from Oman, as well as its potential influence on local society. The Tupak was the muzzle-loading musket used by the Baluch soldiers of the Omani Sultans, and the Jemadar (Jamadar, Jam’dar) was the chieftain representative as well as the Baluch commander in the Sultans’ Omani army. The Baluch in Africa were brought between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by the Omani Arabs as soldiers; once settled, their culture has undergone quite a metamorphosis from {{the end of the}} eighteenth century on. Traditional Baluch lifestyle gradually melted with the Swahili one. Baluch ancestors interacted with local people and assimilated to become part of the cultural and social life of the region. It must be noted however, that they did not lose their identity. Language and culture apart, the Baluch in Africa did maintain an identity from the rest of the people...|$|R
2500|$|As {{in other}} {{minimally}} invasive surgery the first laparoscopic surgeons were smiled at and the surgical community {{did not believe in}} this new technology. Today it is the gold standard for most surgeries. Starting with a simple appendectomy, partial kidney resections and partial liver resections, etc. The laparoscopic approach is expanding. The image quality, the possibility of imaging the patient in the surgical position and the guidance of the instruments facilitate this approach.(Efficacy of DynaCT for surgical navigation during complex laparoscopic surgery: an initial experience. Partial resection of the kidney, leaving as much healthy tissue, meaning kidney function to the patient has been described some time ago (Nephron sparing surgery for renal tumors: indications, techniques and outcomes.). The challenges the surgeons face is the loss of natural 3D vision and tactile <b>sensing.</b> Through small <b>ports</b> he/she has to rely on the images provided by the endoscope and is unable to feel the tissue. In a hybrid operating room the anatomy can be updated and imaged in real time. 3D images can be fused and/or overlaid on live fluoroscopy or the endoscope.

40|$|Properties of {{molecules}} of certain hydrocarbons {{give rise to}} difficult questions in graph theory. This paper is primarily devoted to the graph theory, but the physico-chemical motivation, which is somewhat speculative, is also presented. Molecules of unsaturated hydrocarbons exhibit alternating paths with single and double bonds. Such alternating paths have been postulated to be electrically conductive. When used to conduct, however, such a path is toggled: the single and double bonds are interchanged. This can imply that other alternating paths appear or disappear. In this way, switching behavior arises. This suggests a possibility of molecular computing. Molecules are represented by graphs where certain nodes, called ports, are chosen as connectors to the outside world. At these ports other chemical groups can be attached to observe and influence the behavior. A choice of single and double bonds in the molecule is represented by an almost-perfect matching in the graph-almost, in the <b>sense</b> that the <b>ports</b> and only the ports are allowed to have no double bond attached to them. The corresponding graph theory is a qualitative idealization of the molecules. It {{turns out that the}} switching behavior is completely determined by sets of ports, called cells. The paper is devoted to the question which cells are Kekule cells, i. e., correspond to almost-perfect matchings in graphs. We prove that every Kekule cell is what is known as a linkable Delta-matroid (it appears that this was known). An anonymous referee showed us the existence of a linkable Delta-matroid with 7 ports that is not a Kekule cell. The argument is presented. We classify the linkable cells wit...|$|R
40|$|The SONNETS Innovation Identification Framework is an {{innovative}} methodological framework that will accelerate {{the transformation of}} the public sector into an innovation breeding carrier. The goal of the SONNETS Framework is twofold and lies in supporting innovation both in the public sector and through the public sector. Innovation in the public sector may have an internal or external focus, pertaining to the improvement of the public sector internal processes and the former’s efficiency, and the development of improved services for citizens and businesses respectively, and targets the public sector’s modernization. On the other side, innovation through the public sector focuses on promoting the generation and implementation of innovative ideas and the corresponding creation of value in other sectors and pursues accordingly {{the transformation of the}} public sector into an innovation driver. The Framework emphasizes the necessity to have an informed view of the current societal trends and challenges as a prerequisite for better accommodating the respective needs, as well as the role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a key enabler for innovation, and pursues its goal by means of coupling findings on emerging ICTs and trends with insights on current societal challenges and needs. Such coupling is carried out on the basis of specifying and bringing into the foreground specific innovative solutions for the adoption of the identified technologies and the confrontation of the identified needs respectively. In this respect, the SONNETS Innovation Identification Framework, and more specifically the innovation solutions specified are considered as the means to bridge the identified needs with technologies. The Framework does not limit though its scope in the specification of relevant innovation solutions. It further addresses the assessment and evaluation of their actual innovation potential. The latter is considered under the prism of both the impact and feasibility of the identified solutions. To this end, the Framework defines a set of impact assessment criteria and feasibility assessment criteria, in order to evaluate the innovation potential of the solutions under consideration for the public sector. The former are used to evaluate the magnitude of the potential effects of the identified solutions, whereas the latter are employed to assess the research needs, which the technological, socio-economic and ethical implications of these solutions translate into. The rating of the specified solutions against both the dimensions of impact and feasibility allows to distinguish and, possibly prioritize, those solutions that hold greater value for the public sector, and lays the foundations for designing a concrete time plan of actions and a set of recommendations for their implementation in practice. From a methodological point of view, the SONNETS Framework relies basically on the methods of desk-based research, interviews, focus groups and workshops, and open consultations, and encompasses six logical steps or phases as follows: i) the identification of societal needs, societal and public sector trends/challenges (Needs Identification) ii) the identification of emerging technologies and trends that make a difference today in other sectors (Technology Identification) iii) the selection of a subset of these technologies and trends, and the analysis of the latter in terms of their key characteristics and specificities (Technology Selection and Analysis) iv) the assessment of these technologies in the domains originally met and their correlation to the public sector needs and societal challenges on the basis of existing services and applications, as well as new innovation solutions that may benefit from these technologies (Technology Assessment) v) the evaluation of these services’ and solutions’ innovation potential in terms of both their impact and feasibility (Innovation Identification) vi) the selection among the former, of those that make more <b>sense</b> to be <b>ported</b> to the public sector through the development of adequate scenarios (Scenario Building) vii) the evaluation and ratification of the overall findings (Results Validation). The SONNETS Innovation Identification Framework has guided the innovation identification activities within the SONNETS work-plan, but can also be used as a self-standing innovation framework for the public sector...|$|R
