Do all firms gains equally from investing in acquiring this certification? We examine the heterogeneous returns to the quality signal of CMM certification in the context of the Indian software services industry. Prior theory has argued that certification is important in markets characterized by information asymmetry and is of particular value in settings where suppliers and buyers are spatially dispersed and physically distant, where quality certification is perhaps the only way for a client to gain insight into unobservable management and production practices of the <b>supplier.</b> <b>Drawing</b> upon research in strategy, economics, and technology, we theorize that the impacts of CMM certification on a vendor’s export performance are conditional on factors reflecting the vendor’s strategy (diversification and location) and its competitive environment (the extent of CMM penetration in the vendor’s competition). Analysis of panel data supports our predictions related to the contingent value of CMM certification, and shows that a software service provider gains more from certification in terms of its softwar...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the focus}} on {{establishing}} close, long-term relationships in industrial markets, new suppliers are confronted with considerable restraints on the customer side. Switching barriers as well as uncertainty can prevent buyers from switching but also from searching for new <b>suppliers.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on the theoretical frameworks developed in inter-organizational theory, transaction cost analysis and industrial buying behaviour, a causal model is presented to analyse the effects on the consideration of new suppliers in the buying process. In particular, the antecedents of the proportion of out-suppliers included in the consideration set and in the choice set are examined. These sets indicate the decision {{about the number of}} suppliers that is considered (1) {{in the beginning of the}} search phase (consideration set), and (2) in the end of the search phase (choice set). The proportion of out-suppliers in the consideration set can serve as an indicator for the tendency to switch, whereas the proportion of out-suppliers in the choice set can serve as an indicator for the readiness to switch. While the determinants of these sets are assumed not to differ, it is conceivable that the size of impact is different for the two sets. Explaining these differences is one of the objectives of this study. The theoretical model is tested on data collected from 191 key informants in industrial firms that have recently purchased technical equipment. The results of the study contribute to the knowledge base with respect to buyer-seller relationships and to organizational buying behaviour. The findings have implications fo...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Firms {{face the}} {{challenge}} of working with other firms in their business network so as to increase the value of products and services offered to end customers and consumers. This often requires managers to investing in developing strong and effective business-tobusiness relationships. While an extensive literature examines the different dimensions of successful business-to-business relationships, little research examines how perceived corporate identity is likely to influence market relationships. The paper explores how a buyer and <b>supplier</b> <b>draw</b> on their own identities and the identities of each other in ways that enable them to develop a basis on which to conceptualise and operationalise a strategic sourcing relationship. Specifically, the paper investigates the emergent relationship identity that results from buyer-seller interactions. Methodology/Approach: An in-depth, longitudinal case study of a buyer-supplier relationship which involves an engineering buyer and design services supplier. Findings: The study suggests that the corporate identity of companies involved in a relationship has a prominent role in informing and moulding the relationship. Further, the strategic scope of the analysed business relationship adds to the significance of corporate identity in informing the relationship and, ultimately, the business policy. Finally, a key contribution is the notion of ‘relationship dentity’. Relationship identity conveys the idea that when companies develop a continuous relationship, the relationship itself has a unique identity. Research limitations: The research findings are based on a single case study. Additional research across multiple case studies are needed in order to verify the findings reported. Value of paper: This paper addresses a gap in the literature concerning the areas of the role of corporate identity in business relationship development. The findings are important to research and practice with regard to how companies develop successful business-to-business relationships...|$|R

40|$|This {{submission}} {{consists of}} a collection of four papers. Each paper stands on its own and makes a specific contribution to knowledge. However, the four papers are also closely connected, each providing a building block for understanding how China’s economic rise has affected Vietnam’s industrial development. Taken together, these papers show that the conclusion reached on how China’s rise affects its neighbours depends fundamentally on understanding the changing dynamics over time. So as to unravel these dynamics, this collection focuses on the motorcycle industry and covers a period of a decade. At the beginning of that decade China’s economic rise seemed to be a disaster for Vietnam’s industrial development. By the end the decade, it turned out to have transformed Vietnam’s industrial development and production capabilities. At the heart of this intriguing dynamic is the competition between two models of industrial organisation. The first paper conceptualises the two contrasting models of industrial organisation that underlie the Japanese dominance and the Chinese catch-up in the Asian motorcycle industry. The second and third papers present the findings of the empirical research on Vietnam’s motorcycle industry covering a period of a decade. The second paper shows that China’s economic rise brought about repeated rounds of competition between the Japanese and Chinese models of industrial organisation attempting to gain supremacy in the third country market of Vietnam. The third paper shows that local component suppliers were able to build up considerable production capabilities {{in the course of the}} decade as the changes in industrial organisation created new learning opportunities for these <b>suppliers.</b> <b>Drawing</b> together the findings of the research, the fourth paper argues that the impact of China’s economic rise on the development of Vietnam’s motorcycle industry changed over a decade and that the changing impact can be explained in terms of successive changes in industrial organisation...|$|R
