25|$|Systemic {{therapy is}} {{considered}} {{in people with}} advanced HCC which has spread beyond the liver {{to other areas of}} the body. Currently, the multikinase inhibitor <b>sorafenib</b> is the only chemotherapy shown to be effective against HCC.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sorafenib</b> and sunitinib, {{approved}} for other indications show promise for thyroid cancer {{and are being}} used for some patients who do not qualify for clinical trials. Numerous agents are in phase II clinical trials and XL184 has started a phase III trial.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{importance}} of both Ras and B-Raf mutations in tumorigenesis, several Raf inhibitors were developed to combat cancer, especially against B-Raf exhibiting the V600E mutation. <b>Sorafenib</b> was the first clinically useful agent, that provides a pharmacological alternative to treat previously largely untreatable malignacies, such as renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Several other molecules followed up, such as Vemurafenib, Regorafenib, Dabrafenib, etc.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{outcome is}} poor, because only 10–20% of {{hepatocellular}} carcinomas {{can be removed}} completely using surgery. If the cancer cannot be completely removed, the disease is usually deadly within 3 to 6 months. This is partially due to late presentation with tumors, but also the lack of medical expertise and facilities in the regions with high HCC prevalence. However, survival can vary, and occasionally people will survive much longer than 6 months. The prognosis for metastatic or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma has recently improved due to the approval of <b>sorafenib</b> (Nexavar®) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|The {{available}} {{treatments for}} RCC {{discussed in the}} “Treatment” section are also relevant for the metastatic form of the disease. Options include interleukin-2 which is a standard therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma. From 2007 to 2013, seven new treatments have been approved specifically for mRCC (sunitinib, temsirolimus, bevacizumab, <b>sorafenib,</b> everolimus, pazopanib and axitinib). These new treatments {{are based on the}} fact that renal cell carcinomas are very vascular tumors – they contain a large number of blood vessels. The drugs aim to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels in the tumors, hence slowing growth and in some cases reducing the size of the tumors.|$|E
25|$|RNA {{interference}} of BRAF {{stops the}} multiplication of melanoma tumor cells. This suggests that BRAF inhibitors such as <b>sorafenib,</b> PLX4720, PLX4032, GDC-0879, GSK2118436, or AZ628 may be affective in treating melanoma. These {{have been tested}} and proven {{to slow down the}} production of melanoma due to BRAF mutation but PLX4032 and GSK2118436 show the most promise because they worked the most aggressively in early stages of cell development. Although this drug helps slow down or shrink the tumors, there are many serious side affects to using these drugs that were found in the trials including arthralgia, rash, nausea, phosphosensitivity], fatigue, pruritus and palmo-plantar dysesthesia.|$|E
2500|$|... miR-122 {{levels are}} {{frequently}} reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to normal liver, and low miR-122 levels correlate with poor prognosis. Overexpression of miR-122 reduces tumorigenic properties in HCC cell lines, {{suggesting that it}} functions as a tumor suppressor gene, and increases the response of cells to the chemotherapeutic drugs <b>sorafenib</b> and doxorubicin. Several miR-122 target genes have been implicated in tumorigenesis, including ADAM10, IGF1R, CCNG1 and ADAM17.|$|E
2500|$|Since the ERK {{signaling}} pathway is involved in both physiological and pathological cell proliferation, it is natural that ERK1/2 inhibitors would represent a desirable class of antineoplastic agents. Indeed, many of the proto-oncogenic [...] "driver" [...] mutations are tied to ERK1/2 signaling, such as constitutively active (mutant) receptor tyrosine kinases, Ras or Raf proteins. Although no MKK1/2 or ERK1/2 inhibitors were developed for clinical use, kinase inhibitors that also inhibit Raf kinases (e.g. <b>Sorafenib)</b> are successful antineoplastic agents against various types of cancer.|$|E
50|$|In Australia this is {{the only}} {{indication}} for which <b>sorafenib</b> is listed on the PBS and hence the only Government-subsidised indication for <b>sorafenib.</b> Along with renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the TGA-labelled indications for <b>sorafenib.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Mechanism {{of action}} of {{angiogenesis}} inhibitors. Bevacizumab binds to VEGF inhibiting {{its ability to}} bind to and activate VEGF receptors. Sunitinib and <b>Sorafenib</b> inhibit VEGF receptors. <b>Sorafenib</b> also acts downstream.|$|E
5000|$|Clinical trial results, {{published}} January 2007, showed that, {{compared with}} placebo, treatment with <b>sorafenib</b> prolongs progression-free survival {{in patients with}} advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma in whom previous therapy has failed. The median progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the <b>sorafenib</b> group and 2.8 months {{in the placebo group}} (hazard ratio for disease progression in the <b>sorafenib</b> group, 0.44; 95% confidence interval CI, 0.35 to 0.55; P<0.01).|$|E
50|$|A study {{performed}} in 2011 showed that <b>Sorafenib</b> is active against aggressive fibromatosis. This study {{is being used}} as justification for using <b>Sorafenib</b> as an initial course of treatment in some patients with aggressive fibromatosis.|$|E
50|$|A {{prospective}} single-centre phase II {{study which}} included the patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)concluding {{that the combination of}} <b>sorafenib</b> and DEB-TACE in patients with unresectable HCC is well tolerated and safe, with most toxicities related to <b>sorafenib.</b>|$|E
50|$|At ASCO 2007, {{results from}} the SHARP trial were presented, which showed {{efficacy}} of <b>sorafenib</b> in hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary endpoint was median overall survival, which showed a 44% improvement in patients who received <b>sorafenib</b> compared to placebo (hazard ratio 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.87; p=0.0001). Both median survival and time to progression showed 3-month improvements. There {{was no difference in}} quality of life measures, possibly attributable to toxicity of <b>sorafenib</b> or symptoms related to underlying progression of liver disease. Of note, this trial only included patients with Child-Pugh Class A (i.e. mildest) cirrhosis. Because of this trial <b>Sorafenib</b> obtained FDA approval for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in November 2007.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sorafenib</b> (co-developed and co-marketed by Bayer and Onyx {{under the}} trade name Nexavar), {{is a drug}} {{approved}} {{for the treatment of}} advanced renal cell carcinoma, or advanced kidney cancer, and for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, {{the most common form of}} liver cancer. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%), which were considered to be related to <b>sorafenib,</b> are fatigue, weight loss, rash/desquamation, hand-foot skin reaction, alopecia, diarrhea, anorexia, nausea and abdominal pain. <b>Sorafenib</b> is also being evaluated in additional types of cancer, including thyroid and breast cancers.|$|E
50|$|A phase III trial (SIRT versus <b>sorafenib)</b> is in progress.|$|E
5000|$|In a randomized, double-blind, phase II trial {{combining}} <b>sorafenib</b> with doxorubicin, {{the median}} time to progression {{was not significantly}} delayed compared with doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Median durations of overall survival and progression-free survival were significantly longer in patients receiving <b>sorafenib</b> plus doxorubicin than in those receiving doxorubicin alone.|$|E
50|$|Brivanib alaninate is a multitargeted {{tyrosine}} kinase inhibitor (as is <b>sorafenib).</b>|$|E

5000|$|More general B-Raf inhibitors include GDC-0879, PLX-4720, <b>Sorafenib</b> Tosylate. dabrafenib, LGX818 ...|$|E
5000|$|Examples of [...] "promiscuous" [...] cancer drugs include: Sutent, <b>Sorafenib,</b> Zactima, and AG-013736.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sorafenib</b> {{is being}} studied for {{treatment}} of unresectable plexiform neurofibroma and low-grade astrocytomas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sorafenib</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to show significant activity against Flt3-ITD positive acute myelogenous leukemia.|$|E
50|$|Liver cancer: Treatment {{options include}} surgery, Trans-arterial {{chemotherapy}} (TACE), Radio-frequency abalation (RFA) and multi-kinase (<b>Sorafenib).</b>|$|E
50|$|Like <b>sorafenib,</b> lapatinib is {{a protein}} kinase {{inhibitor}} shown to decrease tumor-causing breast cancer stem cells.|$|E
50|$|The first drug {{licensed}} {{to act on}} this pathway is <b>sorafenib</b> — a Raf kinase inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sorafenib</b> {{treatment}} induces autophagy, {{which may}} suppress tumor growth. However, autophagy {{can also cause}} drug resistance.|$|E
5000|$|There is a phase I/II {{study at}} the Mayo Clinic of <b>sorafenib</b> and CCI-779 (temsirolimus) for {{recurrent}} glioblastoma.|$|E
5000|$|Phase III {{results on}} {{advanced}} {{renal cell carcinoma}} suggested a 30% or 3 months improvement in median PFS compared to <b>sorafenib</b> but showed an inferior overall survival rate of the experimental arm versus the control arm. [...] The Food and Drug Administration's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted in May 2013 13 to 1 against recommending approval of tivozanib for renal cell carcinoma. The committee felt the drug failed to show a favorable risk-benefit ratio and questioned the equipose of the trial design, which allowed control arm patients who used <b>sorafenib</b> to transition to tivozanib following progression disease but not those on the experimental arm using tivozanib to transition to <b>sorafenib.</b> The application was formally rejected by the FDA in June 2013, saying that approval would require additional clinical studies.|$|E
50|$|Current {{experimental}} studies are being done with Gleevec (Imatinib) and Nexavar (<b>sorafenib)</b> {{for treatment of}} desmoid tumors, and show promising success rates.|$|E
50|$|In {{some kinds}} of lung cancer (with squamous-cell histology) <b>sorafenib</b> {{administered}} in addition to paclitaxel and carboplatin may be detrimental to patients.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, a Phase III {{trial for}} {{previously}} treated metastatic {{renal cell carcinoma}} (mRCC) showed significantly extended progression-free survival when compared to <b>sorafenib.</b> In December 2011, the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted unanimously to recommend that US FDA approve axitinib for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), {{based on the results}} of the Phase III trial comparing axitinib and <b>sorafenib.</b> It has also been studied in combination with the ALK1 inhibitor dalantercept.|$|E
50|$|At {{the current}} time <b>sorafenib</b> is {{indicated}} {{as a treatment}} for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and thyroid cancer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sorafenib</b> {{is a small}} {{inhibitor}} {{of several}} tyrosine protein kinases, such as VEGFR, PDGFR and Raf family kinases (more avidly C-Raf than B-Raf).|$|E
50|$|In Australia {{this is one}} of two TGA-labelled {{indications}} for <b>sorafenib,</b> {{although it}} is not listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for this indication.|$|E
