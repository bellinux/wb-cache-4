500|$|Sinclair {{released}} {{only two}} official peripherals for the ZX81, a 16KB RAM pack (actually {{the same one}} previously released for the ZX80, but rebadged) and the ZX Printer, both of which plugged into the edge connector {{at the rear of}} the ZX81. They retailed at a launch price of £49.95 each but both had notable flaws. The RAM pack was top-heavy and was supported only by the edge connector. It had a habit of falling out of its socket at crucial points and crashing the ZX81, losing anything that the user had typed in. Users turned to using sticky lumps of chewing gum, double-sided tape or Blu-Tack to cure what became known as the [...] "RAM pack wobble" [...] problem. The ZX Printer was a tiny <b>spark</b> <b>printer</b> that used two electrically charged styli to burn away the surface of aluminium-coated paper to reveal the black underlay. It worked reasonably well at first but its output deteriorated rapidly after a time.|$|E

5000|$|The Western Union [...] "Deskfax" [...] fax machine, {{announced}} in 1948, was a compact machine that fit comfortably on a desktop, using special <b>spark</b> <b>printer</b> paper.|$|E
50|$|Teledeltos {{paper has}} several uses within {{engineering}} {{that are far}} removed from its original use in <b>spark</b> <b>printers.</b> Many of these use the paper to model the distribution of electric and other scalar fields.|$|R
50|$|The Buccaneer arose because Brendan Goh and You Jun had to {{prototype}} {{designs for}} school projects frequently {{and the large}} costs led to them experimenting with the then new 3D printers. They shared costs with Roger Chang to purchase a 3D printer by Ultimaker. Experimenting with the <b>printer</b> <b>sparked</b> the idea of setting up a 3D printing company. However, they were advised by Professor Neo Kok Beng to instead build a better printer for sale.|$|R
50|$|The Sinclair ZX Printer is a <b>spark</b> <b>printer</b> {{which was}} {{produced}} by Sinclair Research for its ZX81 home computer. It was launched in 1981, with a recommended retail price of £49.95.|$|E
50|$|The FP-10 <b>Spark</b> <b>printer</b> {{was used}} with the FX-602P series of {{programmable}} calculator and the FX-702P Pocket Computer to print out programs, data register and display content. Although the feature was not documented, the FP-10 can also be {{used with the}} FX-502P series and was able to print out programs in Key-code notation.|$|E
50|$|Teledeltos {{paper is}} an {{electrically}} conductive paper. It is formed by a coating of carbon {{on one side}} of a sheet of paper, giving one black and one white side. Western Union developed Teledeltos paper in the late 1940s (several decades after it was already in use for mathematical modelling) for use in <b>spark</b> <b>printer</b> based fax machines and chart recorders.|$|E
50|$|A {{different}} <b>spark</b> <b>printer</b> implementation propelled dry toner {{from a tiny}} hole {{in the end of}} a glass rod, using a high-voltage spark {{between the}} platen and print head. The glass toner rod held a solid mass of toner, pushed toward the ejection tip by a spring. This had the advantage of printing onto plain paper, but the disadvantage of the toner not being cured to the paper, and thus easily smudged. Unlike the Sinclair printer, this printer had only one stylus (the toner rod), since the entire platen behind the paper served as the other spark electrode. The printer could only print one line of pixels at a time.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{than what}} Clarke {{described}} as [...] "a few remarkably poor programs on cassette" [...] Sinclair released only two official peripherals for the ZX81, a 16 KB RAM pack (actually {{the same one}} previously released for the ZX80, but rebadged) and the ZX Printer, both of which plugged into the edge connector {{at the rear of}} the ZX81.
