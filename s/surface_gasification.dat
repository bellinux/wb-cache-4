30|$|UCG {{is similar}} to <b>surface</b> <b>gasification</b> [19], with syngas {{produced}} through the same chemical reactions [12]. The main difference is that <b>surface</b> <b>gasification</b> occurs in a manufactured reactor whereas the reactor for a UCG system is a natural geological formation containing unmined coal [19, 20]. UCG also has similarities to in situ combustion processes applied in heavy-oil recovery and oil shale retorting, with such common operational parameters as roof/floor stability, seam continuity and permeability, and ground water influx [19, 21].|$|E

30|$|Within the {{distillation}} (pyrolysis) zone, {{the coal}} seam is decomposed into multiple volatiles including H 2 O, CO 2, CO, C 2 H 6, CH 4, H 2, tar, and char [21, 28]. At the exit of the gasification channel, the volatile {{composition of the}} syngas consists mostly of CO, H 2, and CH 4. The UCG process can also have other products, including H 2 S, As, Hg, Pb, and ash [27, 29, 30]. The composition of syngas is highly dependent on the gasification agent, air injection method, and coal composition [31, 32]. During operation, the three gasification zones move along {{the direction of the}} air flow, ensuring continuous gasification reactions [21]. A distinguishing feature of UCG, compared to <b>surface</b> <b>gasification,</b> is that drying, pyrolysis, and char gasification occur simultaneously within the coal [26].|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} resin {{molecular}} {{weight on the}} flame-retardant mechanism of silica were studied with two different molecular weights of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), 122, 000 and 996, 000 g/mol, and two silicas, fused silica with a small surface area and silica gel with a large surface area. A total of six different samples were studied, with a mass fraction of 10 % silica. The mass loss rate of the six samples in nitrogen and the heat release rate from burn-ing in air were measured at an external radiant flux of 40 kW/m 2. The addition of silica gel to the low-molecular-weight PMMA significantly reduced the mass loss rate and heat release rate; addition to the high-molecular-weight PMMA provided the largest reductions of these quantities in this study. For fused silica, some reduction in mass loss rate and heat release rate was observed when it {{was added to the}} high-molecular-weight PMMA; addition to the low-molec-ular-weight PMMA did not reduce either loss rate. Chemical analysis of the collected residues and observation of the sample <b>surface</b> during <b>gasification</b> reveal the accumulation of silica near the surface; the larger its coverage over the sample surface was, less the mass loss rate and heat release rate were. Both the level of accumulation and its surface coverage depended strongly not only on the silica charac-teristics but also on the melt viscosity of the PMMA. © 200...|$|R
30|$|Coal is {{the largest}} fossil fuel {{resource}} in the world, with proven reserves that are adequate to meet the expected demand, without much increase in production costs (Couch 2009). With the depletion in {{the oil and gas}} reserves, coal is expected {{to play a major role}} in the global energy sector in the near future (BP 2010). Underground coal gasification (UCG) offers the potential for using the energy stored in coal in an economical and environmentally sensitive way, particularly from deposits that are not mineable by conventional methods (Couch 2009). Therefore, UCG is a candidate process for converting the world’s coal resources into energy, liquid fuels, and chemicals. If the UCG process is developed commercially, it would increase coal reserves by 60  % (Shirazi 2012). The process of UCG eliminates the costs of mining, lowers water consumption and transportation needs, and generates possible sites for CO 2 sequestration, and gasification installation, which are required for traditional <b>surface</b> <b>gasification</b> process (Gregg and Edgar 1978; Burton et al. 2007).

40|$|The wind-aided {{flame spread}} process along a solid fuel rod under oblique forced flow is {{analyzed}} in absence of gravity {{or when the}} forced flow dominates the gravity-induced flow. The transverse velocity {{is large enough to}} ensure that mixing of the fuel vapors and air occurs in a thin boundary layer surrounding the fuel rod and we can use the boundary layer approximation to describe the gas-phase chemical reaction and downwind flame spread process. A global, second-order, Arrhenius expression is employed to describe the gas-phase reaction, while the solid <b>surface</b> <b>gasification</b> reaction is modeled in terms of a constant pyrolysis temperature. The solid is heated by the hot gases convected from the flame by the axial component of the velocity {{in the direction of the}} flame spread. The solid will be considered thermally thick, assuming the thickness of the heated layer in the solid to be small compared with the rod radius. The analysis determines the flame spread velocity and the flow structure in the flame front region. The analysis also shows that flame spread is not possible at large flow velocities due to finite rate effects, while at low velocities the gas-phase reaction is diffusion-controlled. By including radiation losses from the surface a flame spread limit, at low velocities, is also found in the present analysis...|$|E
40|$|Our prior CCTR-funded {{project on}} {{underground}} coal gasification (UCG) {{has shown that}} this technology has great potential to grow and replace/complement traditional methods for coal mining and <b>surface</b> <b>gasification</b> [1]. Some basic screening criteria for selecting UCG sites in Indiana were formulated in the previous report [2]. Using the available information {{on the characteristics of}} coal seams in Indiana, it was recommended to focus on the Springfield and Seelyville coal beds. For these coals, maps were generated that show thickness, depth and other characteristics, such as moisture content and heating value for these two coals. Analysis of the maps and additional information identified nine promising zones for UCG in Indiana (five for the Seelyville and four for the Springfield Coal). For these zones, the lists of characteristics, including the amounts of available coal, were prepared. Based on these data, preliminary recommendations on the future selection of a suitable location for UCG operations were made. As a follow-up of the first project described above, we have completed the second CCTR-funded project which investigates gasification kinetics of coal samples from the Seelyville and Springfield seams. This investigation is required because Indiana coals, although of similar rank, may have significantly different chemical and petrographic compositions, also accompanied by differences in porosity and permeability of the coal [3]. Knowledge of gasification kinetics and understanding of the permeability effect is necessary for the modeling and success of UCG operations.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the NO-carbon {{reaction was}} studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The reactivity {{as a function}} of carbon conversion was systematically investigated through characterization of the pore structure and carbon active site evolution during reaction. Total surface area measured by CO, adsorption at 273 K gives a relatively constant normalized reactivity over a wide range of carbon conversions. The carbon active surface area (ASA) and unoccupied active surface area (UASA) were estimated from low-temperature NO chemisorption capacities. Large amounts of stable C-O complexes are found to form during the reaction. Results show that ASA or UASA measured in this way do not represent the reactive <b>surface</b> area under <b>gasification</b> conditions.

Drop-burning rates were measured with drops supported in a combustion gas environ-ment at pressures of 0. 2 - 7. 0 MPa. Some internal gasification of drops—causing swelling, partial bursting, and microexplosions—was observed throughout this region, but these disturbances decreased with increasing pressure. Effective drop-burning rates (including effects of both <b>surface</b> <b>gasification</b> and bursting) were relatively constant, ca. 10 mm/s, and were consistent with earlier strand-burning-rate measurements of gelled propellant. Pressure-atomized combusting sprays were studied in combustion gas environments at pressures of 3 - 9 MPa. The liquid-containing region was significantly larger than earlier measurements of Birk and Reeves, 19 as well as predictions based on the locally-homogeneous-flow approximation of multiphase flow theory.

40|$|Our {{interdisciplinary}} team, {{known as}} Forge, {{has built a}} cookstove that not only can be a portable cookstove, but also includes a port to charge devices such as a phone using thermoelectrics. The product has been designed for developing areas in Nicaragua where power is inaccessible and a multi-purpose cookstove/phone charger could be of use. The cookstove features a cylindrical combustion chamber {{that can be used}} for gasification. Gasification is a burning process where smoke from the fire is also burned, creating higher temperatures and a cleaner burn. The combustion chamber is insulated using refractory cement, which will drop the temperature from about 700 Celsius inside the chamber to 200 Celsius outside the chamber. The cookstove outputs heat at a rate of 4. 6 - 6. 6 kW. The cookstove has thermoelectric modules attached to the outside, which, by utilizing the Seebeck effect, convert excess heat into electrical energy. Ideally, the energy would be transferred into the phone at 5 volts and 0. 5 - 0. 6 amps and some of the electrical energy would be used to power a cooling fan to help the stove function properly. The final temperatures that were recorded ranged from around 400 ºC to 700 ºC in the combustion chamber and around 500 ºC for the cooking <b>surface.</b> <b>Gasification</b> was successfully occurring during this stage, and the smoke was being visibly burned off. The electrical output was less successful, resulting with only around 0. 08 V coming out of the thermoelectric generators due to the lack of air flow within the electrical housing and poor electrical connection.

40|$|Energy {{security}} and {{global climate change}} {{are two of the}} greatest challenges that face the next century and {{it will be up to}} this generation to figure out a solution to these monumental challenges. Nearly everything ranging from commerce to travel to education relies on abundant and cheap energy to function and progress. For the last 150 years, this energy has come through the combustion of fossil fuels which are limited by their very nature. As these fuels are combusted to produce heat and power, various harmful gasses are emitted into the atmosphere and can lead to 2 ̆ 2 acid rain, 2 ̆ 2 smog, depletion of the ozone layer, and even a heating of the earth 2 ̆ 7 s <b>surface.</b> <b>Gasification</b> of biomass provides one possible solution to both of these problems by utilizing a renewable energy source that is abundant and has the potential to be carbon negative. NOx emissions are regulated by the government and could potentially be the limiting factor on the potential of biomass gasification to have a major impact in overcoming the two greatest challenges of today. It is believed one of the primary causes of NOx emissions is due to nitrogen found in the feedstock that is gasified. This work is aimed at both developing the tools necessary to understand the detailed systems involved in biomass gasification, as well as to characterize the NOx emissions that result from the combustion of the biomass-derived producer gas. In the current work, a two-fold approach is taken to address this issue. First, a process model is created utilizing the software Aspen Plus to simulate data taken from a pilot-scale gasification system utilizing maple and oak wood as the feedstock and air as the gasification medium. This model uses a mass balance approach to simulate the gasification process. A system of cyclones filter out the particulate matter in the producer gas before the gas is burned. Second, the effects of fuel-NOx are studied experimentally utilizing a newly developed lab-scale, low-swirl combustion apparatus. This combustion apparatus is first tested using natural gas that contains low concentrations of ammonia for four swirlers with varying effective areas. A single swirler is chosen to conduct tests to analyze the effect of ammonia concentration on NOx emissions from the producer gas. Results of the current work can be summarized as follows. (1) A biomass gasification model was created to model the gasification of wood feedstock. This model shows very good agreement with experimental results for all components except hydrogen in the producer gas. (2) For the swirlers studied, NOx emissions are reduced as the swirl strength increases. (3) For a natural gas flame, both the equivalence ratio and effect of thermal NOx are important considerations when trying to achieve low NOx emissions. (4) For the combustion of producer gas, higher equivalence ratios reduce the overall NOx emissions. The above results show the need for a greater understanding of producer gas combustion in low-swirl burners for a wide variety of compositions in order to better control overall emissions in the future...|$|E

Injection and production wells were simulated using the HYSYS pipe flow utilities which {{makes use of}} the Beggs and Brill flow correlation applicable for vertical pipes. The downhole reservoir hydrothermal reactions were assumed to be in equilibrium, and hence, the Gibbs reactor was used. It was found that high W/C ratios and low O/C ratios are required to maximise gasification efficiency at a constant hydrocarbon feed flowrate, while {{the opposite is true}} for the energy efficiency. This occurs due to the dependence of process energy efficiency on the gas pressure and temperature at <b>surface,</b> while the <b>gasification</b> efficiency depends on the gas composition which is determined by the reservoir reaction conditions which affects production distribution. Another effect of paramount importance is the increase in reservoir production rate which was found to directly enhance both energy and gasification efficiency showing conditions where the both efficiencies are theoretically maximised.

Between 1960 and 1985 intensive coal-energy development—in the form of strip mines and power plants—took place in the western portion of the San Juan Basin. This period saw the enactment of major environmental legislation {{and the rise of the}} modern environmental movement. My thesis specifically focuses on how this development unleashed environmental damage upon the region’s land, water, and air. Beyond examining environmental destruction, my thesis explores how different groups came into conflict over coal-energy development. The groups that most actively contested the development of coal-energy were Navajo tribal leaders, local Navajo communities, Navajo activists, environmental organizations, and energy and mining corporations. I make the argument that each group built a discourse around energy development, environmental legislation, and the natural environment in ways that conformed to each group’s particular interests. The mere specter of energy development unleashed intergroup conflict even when plans for <b>surface</b> mines, coal <b>gasification,</b> and power plant projects did not materialize. Failed energy projects still resulted in social and landscape changes, such as intergroup conflict, factionalizing of Navajo political and social structures, changes in legal control over land, and the designation of wilderness areas within coal regions.

Linear and stepwise heating programs {{were employed to}} increase the information content of the experimental data sets. Low sample masses were used {{because of the high}} enthalpy change. Seven experiments with different experimental conditions were evaluated simultaneously for each sample. The method of least-squares was employed. Three reactions appeared in the temperature domain evaluated (600 - 1000 degrees C). The first and second reactions were due to the devolatilization and did not show a significant dependence upon the CO 2 concentration. They were approximated by first-order kinetics. The third reaction corresponded to the gasification. Its modeling was based on an empirical approximation of the change of the reaction <b>surface</b> during the <b>gasification</b> and by a formal reaction order with respect to the CO 2 concentration. Very close results were obtained for the two charcoals. The dependence upon the conversion could be well-approximated by power law kinetics. In the next step of the evaluation, the experiments of the two samples (14 experiments combined) were evaluated together, assuming common activation energy values and a common reaction order with respect to the CO 2 concentration. This process led to nearly the same fit as the separate evaluation of the two samples. The activation energy of the gasification step was 262 kJ/mol. The reaction order of CO 2 was 0. 40...|$|R
3000|$|With {{reference}} to the above studies and previous research, this short paper demonstrates that when C 2 H 4 decomposition takes place at 473  K, its dissociative adsorption leads {{to the formation of}} hydrocarbon CH x [...] species on the Ir surfaces. These species can then be readily hydrogenated into gaseous CH 4 in the second step. As the decomposition temperature reaches 573  K, CH x [...] groups on the catalyst surface can assemble to ethylidyne- or vinylidene-like surface species similar to those surface reactions reported by Bond et al. and Goodman et al. [6, 18]. Their presence can be clearly reflected by the TPSR–MS results, where both gaseous CH 4 and C 2 compounds were detected upon hydrogenation (Fig.  5). In addition, surface C 1 polymerization and metathesis reactions clearly took place at ≤ 573  K on the Ir surface, resulting in the formation of a range of higher hydrocarbons. But, the gaseous hydrocarbon distribution formed appears to be quite different from that reported on Ni and Pt catalysts [10]. Stepwise C 2 H 4 adsorption can produce surface ethylidyne, ethynyl, and carbon and hydrogen atoms on the metallic Ir and their surface interactions (i.e. metathesis) at different rates as compared to other metal surfaces [6]. We thus believe that both the iridium–carbon bond strength and the silica support must play some important roles during this process. More detailed studies on these aspects are currently in progress. Nevertheless, these hydrocarbon species are not stable at higher temperatures and can be transformed or decomposed into more stable graphitic carbon deposits. Interestingly, despite their reluctance for hydrogenation these carbons can react readily with H 2 O produced from the dehydroxylation reaction on the catalyst <b>surface</b> via steam <b>gasification</b> [19] to form H 2 /CO in the second step at elevated temperature.|$|R
40|$|Gasification {{of black}} liquor is an {{alternative}} to the combustion of black liquor, which is currently the dominant form of chemical recovery in the paper industry. Gasification of black liquor offers the possibility of higher thermal efficiencies than combustion, reducing manufacturing costs and creating new revenue streams through a forest biorefinery. Pressurizing the gasification reactor further enhances the efficiency advantage of gasification over combustion. This study uses a pressurized entrained flow reactor (PEFR) to study black liquor gasification behavior under pressures, temperatures, and heating rates similar to those of next-generation high-temperature black liquor gasifiers. The effects of pressure on black liquor char morphology, gasification rates, pyrolysis carbon yields, and sulfur phase distribution were studied. These characteristics were investigated in three main groups of experiments at 900 oC: pyrolysis (100 % N 2), gasification with constant partial pressure (0. 25 bar H 2 O and 0. 50 bar CO 2), and gasification with constant mole fraction (10 % CO 2, 2 % H 2 O, 1. 7 % CO, 0. 3 % H 2), under five, ten, and fifteen bar total pressure. It was found that pressure {{had an impact on the}} char physical characteristics immediately after the char entered the reactor. Increasing pressure had the effect of decreasing the porosity of the chars. Pressure also affected particle destruction and reagglomeration mechanisms. <b>Surface</b> areas of <b>gasification</b> chars decreased with increasing pressures, but only at low carbon conversions. The rate of carbon conversion in gasification was shown to be a function of the gas composition near the particle, with higher levels of inhibiting gases slowing carbon conversion. The same phenomenon of product gas inhibition observed in gasification was used to explain carbon conversions in pyrolysis reactions. Sulfur distribution between condensed and gas phases was unaffected by increasing total pressure in the residence times investigated. Significant amounts of sulfur are lost during initial devolatilization. With water present this gas phase sulfur forms H 2 S and did not return to the condensed phase. Ph. D.

40|$|The chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) {{process is}} a novel solution for efficient combustion with direct capture of carbon dioxide. The process uses a metal oxide as an oxygen carrier to transfer oxygen from an air to a fuel reactor, where the fuel reacts with the solid oxygen carrier. In this work, six different manganese ores are investigated as oxygen carriers for CLC application. The chemical-looping characteristics of the oxygen carriers were evaluated in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed reactor in the temperature range of 900 - 970 oC during alternating reducing and oxidizing conditions. Three of the manganese ores showed a small oxygen release in inert environment between 850 and 950 oC. During reactivity tests, the gas yield with methane increased with the temperature and complete conversion of 50 % CO in H 2 was obtained {{for all of the}} ores. The rates of char gasification of two fuels, namely Mexican petroleum coke and Swedish wood char, were compared for the different manganese ores at 970 oC and with 50 % H 2 O in N 2 as fluidizing gas. Ilmenite and a manufactured Mn-oxide oxygen carrier consisting of Mn 3 O 4 and MgO-stabilized ZrO 2 as support were also included for comparison. The char gasification rate and the gas conversion were higher with the manganese ores and the Mn-oxide oxygen carrier compared to ilmenite. However, the higher reactivity of the manganese ores with H 2 and the ensuing decrease in H 2 inhibition for manganese ores is not sufficient to explain their higher rate of char <b>gasification.</b> <b>Surface</b> analysis of partially gasified petcoke particles in the presence of manganese ores showed formation of cavities and channels as well as a uniform distribution of potassium and sodium elements. The rate of char gasification also increased with the concentration of potassium and sodium impurities in the manganese ores. Thus the results suggest that the increased rate of char conversion for manganese ores is due to alkali-catalyzed steam gasification. The increase in rate of char gasification, in combination with potentially low costs of these materials suggests that manganese ores could be interesting materials for CLC with solid fuels...|$|R
40|$|Utilization {{of biomass}} as an energy source {{is likely to}} {{increase}} in the near future. One way to recover energy from biomass is via gasification, which enables the production of electricity, heat, chemicals, or fuels such as synthetic natural gas or gasoline. The desired product from gasification is synthesis gas, which is a mixture of CO and H 2; however by-products such as tar and char are formed. The tars must be decomposed or removed, as they can cause clogging in downstream equipment. Tars are most commonly decomposed catalytically or thermally. However, thermal decomposition requires high temperatures, and catalyst deactivation takes place during catalytic decomposition. This thesis focuses on the utilization of char as a catalyst for tar decomposition. Char has a surface area that is higher than many typical catalysts, and contains catalytic minerals and metals which are well dispersed on the surface. Using char in this application would eliminate the need for purchasing expensive catalysts, and deactivation would not be a concern since deactivated char could be easily replaced by fresh char which is produced inside the gasifier. In addition, it provides a useful application for the char, which would otherwise be considered to be a low value product. In this work, poplar wood was gasified in a fluidized bed reactor under steam and CO 2 at 550, 750, and 920 C for different periods of time. The char was recovered from the fluidized bed, and its properties were studied. The BET surface area of the char ranged from 429 - 687 m^ 2 g^- 1 and increased with increasing gasification temperature or time. In addition, micropores were observed in char that was made in CO 2, but not in char that was made in steam. Gasification was also done in an ESEM under air, steam, and CO 2. ESEM results showed sintering of the metals and minerals on the char <b>surface</b> during <b>gasification</b> in air and steam, but sintering was not observed during gasification with CO 2. This showed that the properties of char depend on the gasification conditions. Catalytic activity of the char was demonstrated for decomposition of methane, propane, and toluene, which is a major component of gasification tar. The light off temperature for methane decomposition using a char catalyst was 100 C lower than the light off temperature when a commercial Pt/Al 2 CO 3 catalyst was used. Higher surface area char had higher catalytic activity. However, microporous char had lower catalytic activity than non-microporous char with a similar surface area, indicating that diffusion limitations occur in the micropores, reducing access to these catalytic sites. Deactivation was observed during catalytic cracking of CH 4. A 20 % reduction in surface area and 33 % reduction in mesopore volume were observed when comparing the used char catalyst to the fresh sample. This indicates that deactivation occurs via pore blocking. Kinetic analysis of the data showed a steeper deactivation function for mesoporous char that was made in H 2 O compared to microporous char that was made in CO 2. A steeper deactivation function is indicative of a higher number of catalyst sites per pore, since once a pore becomes blocked all of the catalytic sites within the pore will become inaccessible. Therefore, char made in steam, which is mesoporous, has more accessible catalyst sites per pore. The char morphology influences its catalytic activity, which increases with increasing accessible surface area. The accessible surface area of the char depends on both the surface area and the porosity of the char. Carbon based materials such as chars have been used in low temperature catalytic applications. In these applications, the catalytic activity is attributed to the presence of oxygen groups on the surface. Therefore, in this thesis the role of oxygen groups in the catalytic activity of the char for high temperature applications was investigated. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) was used to identify the types of oxygen groups on the char surface and both acidic (lactone, carboxylic) and basic (pyrone, quinone) groups were identified. There {{were no significant differences in}} the concentration and type of surface oxygen groups amongst the different char samples. In order to understand the role that these compounds play in the catalytic activity of the char, oxygen was added to the surface of a char sample via nitric acid treatment and its catalytic performance was compared to the raw char. However, when the sample was heated in nitrogen to the reaction temperature (850 C) prior to utilization for methane decomposition, the oxygen groups desorbed, and the catalytic activity of the oxygenated char was the same as the raw char. Therefore, the char has catalytic activity even when the acidic surface oxygen groups have been removed. The role of metals in the catalytic activity of the char was studied. Metals were removed via acid washing, and the catalytic activity of the acid washed char was compared to the untreated char. The catalytic activity of the acid washed char was 19 % lower than the untreated char, which demonstrated that the presence of metals increases the catalytic activity of the char. The metals were found to be dispersed on the surface of the char. When the char was heated to 1000 C, and was then used to catalyze the decomposition of CH 4, the catalytic activity of the char was lower than the untreated sample. Therefore, the gasification process preserves the high dispersion of inorganic elements in the char, which improves the catalytic performance of the char. Char is often considered to be a by-product of gasification processes. However, this work has shown that char is a valuable product that has the potential to be used in catalytic applications. It has a surface area which is higher than many commercial catalysts, and contains metals and minerals which are catalytically active and are well dispersed on the char surface...|$|R

In order to avoid the disturbing and possibly masking effect of other impurities normally present in industrial anode materials, this work uses cokes made by carbonization of high purity carbon precursors (tar oil/petroleum pitch) in a laboratory scale coke reactor. Known amounts of fluoride salts or the corresponding metal acetylacetonates are added to the liquid precursor prior to carbonization. “High”-sulfur cokes are prepared by also adding 4. 5 weight percent dibenzothiophene to the precursor (corresponds to an addition of 1 wt% elemental sulfur). The calcined coke samples are characterized in terms of reactivity towards air and CO 2 gasification, size and shape of optical texture units and degree of turbostratic order. Scanning electron microscopy and surface area measurements are used to study the surface textural changes resulting from the catalyzed gasification. The extent of gasification inside industrial prebaked and Søderberg anodes is investigated by characterizing anode core samples in terms of air permeabilities, contamination profiles and reactivities towards air and CO 2 gasification. The characteristics are related to findings from electron microscopy examinations. COKES DOPED WITH SODIUM ACETYLACETONATE, SODIUM FLUORIDE AND CRYOLITE Sodium acetylacetonate decomposes completely to sodium carbonate during carbonization and calcination of the coke samples. At the initial stages of gasification, the sodium carbonate particles decompose to a sodium oxide phase, which catalyzes the air and CO 2 gasification reactions strongly. Sodium fluoride and cryolite also act as strong gasification catalysts. Due to formation of higher amounts of inhibiting fluorine gases (COF 2, AlOF 2), the cryolite doped cokes are less reactive than the corresponding sodium fluoride cokes. The difference between the two coke series is especially pronounced during air gasification. The air reactivity of the sodium-doped cokes is markedly reduced when 4. 5 weight percent dibenzothiophene is added to the coke precursors prior to carbonization. During carbonization, the sulfur is stabilized in large aromatic molecules and it is only liberated when the carbon matrix is gasified. The free sulfur adsorbs on the active sites of the sodium particles and lowers their catalytic activity. The Na-S adsorption complexes are thermally unstable at the CO 2 gasification temperature (960 °C) and the CO 2 gasification rates are therefore not affected by the dibenzothiophene additions.

There are no cocatalytic effects between calcium and sodium i. e. the catalytic activity of calcium is not affected by the concurrent presence of sodium and vice versa. GAS REACTIVITY OF INDUSTRIAL ANODES The carbon dioxide produced at the anode working surface, percolates through the open porosity of the anodes and reacts with accessible carbon in the lower parts. Airburn is mainly of concern at the exposed parts of prebaked anodes (anode tops and the sides near the tapping positions) and under the gas skirts of the Søderberg anodes. From air permeability measurements and electron microscopy examinations, internal CO 2 gasification is found to occur in the lower 3 – 5 cm of prebaked anodes. Depending on the anode top <b>surface</b> temperature, air <b>gasification</b> may occur as deep as 4 cm below the anode top surface. In Søderberg anodes the extent of internal CO 2 gasification strongly depends on the gas permeability of the anode. In high-permeability Søderberg anodes, CO 2 gasification may occur as far as 60 cm above the working surface. Higher up, the temperature is normally too low for gasification. In some particular low-permeability Søderberg anodes (permeability resembling “bad” prebaked anodes), internal CO 2 gasification is limited to the lower 15 – 20 cm of the anodes. In both prebaked and Søderberg anodes, the more reactive binder coke is selectively gasified. Since much of the binder phase in the lower parts of the high-permeability Søderberg anodes is consumed, substantial dusting is expected from the working surface of these anodes. In the prebaked anodes, the binder phase is mostly structurally intact. Catalytically active sodium and calcium impurities are mainly introduced to prebaked anodes via the addition of butts. Pot-room dust is an important contamination source in Søderberg anodes. Additionally, the lower parts of especially the high-permeability Søderberg anodes are contaminated by gaseous sodium and aluminium bath species that penetrates into the anode open porosity and condense within the anodes. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
