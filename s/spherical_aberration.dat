5|$|After the <b>spherical</b> <b>aberration</b> was {{corrected}} during Space Shuttle mission STS-61 in 1993, {{the improved}} imaging {{capabilities of the}} telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The Medium Deep Survey (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe <b>spherical</b> <b>aberration,</b> a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E
5|$|The Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) {{system was}} {{designed}} to correct the <b>spherical</b> <b>aberration</b> for light focused at the FOC, FOS, and GHRS. It consists of two mirrors in the light path with one ground to correct the aberration. To fit the COSTAR system onto the telescope, {{one of the other}} instruments had to be removed, and astronomers selected the High Speed Photometer to be sacrificed. By 2002, all of the original instruments requiring COSTAR had been replaced by instruments with their own corrective optics. COSTAR was removed and returned to Earth in 2009 where it is exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum. The area previously used by COSTAR is now occupied by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.|$|E
40|$|The {{deviation}} {{of light to}} create normal retinal image in the optical system is called aberration. Aberrations are divided two subgroup: low-order <b>aberrations</b> (defocus: <b>spherical</b> and cylindrical refractive errors) and high-order <b>aberrations</b> (coma, <b>spherical,</b> trefoil, tetrafoil, quadrifoil, pentafoil, secondary astigmatism). Aberrations increase with aging. <b>Spherical</b> <b>aberrations</b> are compensated by positive corneal and negative lenticular <b>spherical</b> <b>aberrations</b> in youth. Total aberrations are elevated by positive corneal and positive lenticular <b>spherical</b> <b>aberrations</b> in elderly. In this study, we aimed to analyze the basic terms regarding optic aberrations which have gained significance recently. (Turk J Ophthalmol 2014; 44 : 306 - 11...|$|R

5|$|One {{of the key}} aims of {{the astronomers}} who {{designed}} the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high optical resolution to study distant galaxies {{to a level of}} detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the atmosphere, Hubble avoids atmospheric airglow allowing it to take more sensitive visible and ultraviolet light images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good adaptive optics correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from <b>spherical</b> <b>aberration</b> when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because light takes billions of years to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows {{a better understanding of how}} they evolve.|$|E

25|$|<b>Spherical</b> <b>aberration</b> {{occurs because}} spherical {{surfaces}} {{are not the}} ideal shape for a lens, but {{are by far the}} simplest shape to which glass can be ground and polished, and so are often used. <b>Spherical</b> <b>aberration</b> causes beams parallel to, but distant from, the lens axis to be focused in a slightly different place than beams close to the axis. This manifests itself as a blurring of the image. Lenses in which closer-to-ideal, non-spherical surfaces are used are called aspheric lenses. These were formerly complex to make and often extremely expensive, but advances in technology have greatly reduced the manufacturing cost for such lenses. <b>Spherical</b> <b>aberration</b> can be minimised by carefully choosing the surface curvatures for a particular application. For instance, a plano-convex lens, which is used to focus a collimated beam, produces a sharper focal spot when used with the convex side towards the beam source.|$|E

25|$|Spherical concave and convex mirrors do {{not focus}} {{parallel}} rays {{to a single}} point due to <b>spherical</b> <b>aberration.</b> However, the ideal of focusing to a point is a commonly used approximation. Parabolic reflectors resolve this, allowing incoming parallel rays (for example, light from a distant star) to be focused to a small spot; almost an ideal point. Parabolic reflectors are not suitable for imaging nearby objects because the light rays are not parallel.|$|E
40|$|Aspheric {{shaping of}} {{geodesic}} lenses in optical waveguides is suggested {{as a means}} for correcting <b>spherical</b> <b>aberrations.</b> The technique is complementary to the method of Spiller and Harper, in which geodesic lens aberrations are reduced by thickening the waveguiding layer in the lens region. The properties of a family of oblate-spheroidal lenses with no third-order <b>spherical</b> <b>aberrations</b> are described theoretically. Diffraction-limited performance over apertures up to one-half the full lens aperture is predicted for lenses with true f/numbers (focal length divided by useful aperture) in the range 2 - 12. By combining spheroidal-shaping and mode-index correction techniques, geodesic lenses free from both third- and fifth-order aberrations can be designed.

40|$|Conventional optical imaging systems {{suffer from}} the {{presence}} of many imperfections, such as <b>spherical</b> <b>aberrations,</b> astigmatism, or coma. If the imaging system is corrected for <b>spherical</b> <b>aberrations</b> and fulfills the Abbe sine condition, perfect imaging is guaranteed between two parallel planes but only in a small neighborhood of the optical axis. It is therefore worth asking for optical systems that would allow for perfect imaging between arbitrary smooth surfaces without restrictions in shape or extension. In this Letter, we describe the application of transformation optics to design refractive index distributions that allow perfect, aberration-free imaging for various imaging configurations in R(n).

25|$|Other uses are in imaging {{systems such}} as monoculars, binoculars, telescopes, microscopes, cameras and projectors.

25|$|In {{the eyes}} of most mammals, birds, reptiles, and most other {{terrestrial}} vertebrates (along with spiders and some insect larvae) the vitreous fluid has a higher refractive index than the air. In general, the lens is not spherical. Spherical lenses produce <b>spherical</b> <b>aberration.</b> In refractive corneas, the lens tissue is corrected with inhomogeneous lens material (see Luneburg lens), or with an aspheric shape. Flattening the lens has a disadvantage; the quality of vision is diminished away from the main line of focus. Thus, animals that have evolved with a wide field-of-view often have eyes that make use of an inhomogeneous lens.|$|E
25|$|Some {{marine organisms}} bear {{more than one}} lens; for {{instance}} the copepod Pontella has three.

Another copepod, Copilia, has two lenses in each eye, arranged like those in a telescope. Such arrangements are rare and poorly understood, but represent an alternative construction. Multiple lenses are seen in some hunters such as eagles and jumping spiders, which have a refractive cornea (discussed next): these have a negative lens, enlarging the observed image by up to 50% over the receptor cells, thus increasing their optical resolution.|$|E

40|$|SummarySuper-resolution imaging {{deep inside}} tissues has been challenging, {{as it is}} {{extremely}} sensitive to light scattering and <b>spherical</b> <b>aberrations.</b> Here, we report an optimized optical clearing agent for high-resolution fluorescence imaging (SeeDB 2). SeeDB 2 matches the refractive indices of fixed tissues to that of immersion oil (1. 518), thus minimizing both light scattering and <b>spherical</b> <b>aberrations.</b> During the clearing process, fine morphology and fluorescent proteins were highly preserved. SeeDB 2 enabled super-resolution microscopy of various tissue samples up {{to a depth of}} > 100  μm, an order of magnitude deeper than previously possible under standard mounting conditions. Using this approach, we demonstrate accumulation of inhibitory synapses on spine heads in NMDA-receptor-deficient neurons. In the fly medulla, we found unexpected heterogeneity in axon bouton orientations among Mi 1 neurons, a part of the motion detection circuitry. Thus, volumetric super-resolution microscopy of cleared tissues is a powerful strategy in connectomic studies at synaptic levels...|$|R

We demonstrate reduction of the longitudinal energy spread and realization of a lens with control over its focal length and sign, as well as the sign of the <b>spherical</b> <b>aberrations.</b> This creates new possibilities to correct for the <b>spherical</b> and chromatic <b>aberrations</b> which are presently limiting the spatial resolution...|$|R
25|$|In 1747, Leonhard Euler {{sent to the}} Prussian Academy of Sciences a {{paper in}} which he tried to prove the {{possibility}} of correcting both the chromatic and the <b>spherical</b> <b>aberration</b> of a lens. Like Gregory and Hall, he argued that since the various humours of the human eye were so combined as to produce a perfect image, {{it should be possible}} by suitable combinations of lenses of different refracting media to construct a perfect telescope objective. Adopting a hypothetical law of the dispersion of differently colored rays of light, he proved analytically the possibility of constructing an achromatic objective composed of lenses of glass and water.|$|E
25|$|For a given subject framing {{and camera}} position, the DOF is {{controlled}} by the lens aperture diameter, which is usually specified as the f-number, the ratio of lens focal length to aperture diameter. Reducing the aperture diameter (increasing the f-number) increases the DOF because the circle of confusion is shrunk directly and indirectly by reducing the light hitting the outside of the lens which is focused to a different point than light hitting the inside of the lens due to <b>spherical</b> <b>aberration</b> caused by the construction of the lens; however, it also reduces the amount of light transmitted, and increases diffraction, placing a practical limit {{on the extent to which}} DOF can be increased by reducing the aperture diameter.|$|E
25|$|Mirrors with curved {{surfaces}} can be modelled by {{ray tracing}} {{and using the}} law of reflection at each point on the surface. For mirrors with parabolic surfaces, parallel rays incident on the mirror produce reflected rays that converge at a common focus. Other curved surfaces may also focus light, but with aberrations due to the diverging shape causing the focus to be smeared out in space. In particular, spherical mirrors exhibit <b>spherical</b> <b>aberration.</b> Curved mirrors can form images with magnification greater than or less than one, and the magnification can be negative, indicating that the image is inverted. An upright image formed by reflection in a mirror is always virtual, while an inverted image is real and can be projected onto a screen.|$|E
