25|$|At {{the start}} of a typical Question Period, the Speaker recognizes the Leader of the Opposition to ask the lead question. It is {{possible}} for the question to be asked by a designee of the Leader of the Opposition, yet this Member of Parliament must {{be a member of the}} Official Opposition. Following the answer to the lead question, the lead questioner has two more questions permitted, referred to as <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions.</b> These questions may be asked by the same Member of Parliament to follow up on the answer provided to the lead question, or they may be given to another member of the Official Opposition.|$|E
500|$|Question Time is the {{flagship}} BBC Television political panel show, {{which began in}} 1979. The weekly show, hosted by David Dimbleby since 1994, takes place at locations around the country. Questions from a local audience are directed to a panel of invited guests, usually consisting of British politicians, alongside other public figures. The topics for debate during the programme are loosely defined by [...] "set-piece" [...] questions from pre-selected audience members. For each topic, the question is answered by each panel member in turn, followed by <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> on the topic, time permitting. The show is pre-recorded {{a few hours before}} being broadcast, and it is stressed by Dimbleby as the programme starts, that the panellists have no previous knowledge of the content of the questions.|$|E
500|$|Parliamentary time is {{also set}} aside for {{question}} periods in the debating chamber. A [...] "General Question Time" [...] takes place on a Thursday between 11:40a.m. and noon where members can direct questions to {{any member of the}} Scottish Government. At 2:30pm, a 40-minute-long themed [...] "Question Time" [...] takes place, where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day, such as health and justice or education and transport. Between noon and 12:30p.m. on Thursdays, when Parliament is sitting, First Minister's Question Time takes place. This gives members an opportunity to question the First Minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction. Opposition leaders ask a general question of the First Minister and then <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions.</b> Such a practice enables a [...] "lead-in" [...] to the questioner, who then uses their supplementary question to ask the First Minister a question on any issue. The five general questions available to opposition leaders are: ...|$|E
50|$|Occasionally {{the first}} {{question}} tabled is on a specific area of policy, not the engagements question. This, though, is quite rare as it would allow the Prime Minister to prepare a response in advance; the non-descript question allows some chance of catching him or her out with an unexpected <b>supplementary</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
25|$|When the Official Opposition has {{exhausted}} {{its initial}} three questions, the lead questioners {{of the other}} officially-recognized opposition parties are permitted an initial <b>question</b> and one <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> each, in order of size. Given {{the composition of the}} current 42nd Canadian Parliament, once the Official Opposition, the Conservative Party, is finished, the next question comes from the only other officially-recognized opposition party, the New Democratic Party.|$|R
5000|$|Backbench MPs {{wishing to}} ask a {{question}} must enter their names on the Order Paper. The names of entrants are then shuffled in a ballot to produce a random order in which they will be called by the Speaker. The Speaker will then call on MPs to put their questions, usually in an alternating fashion: one MP from the government benches is followed by one from the opposition benches. MPs who are not selected may be chosen {{to ask a}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> if they [...] "catch the eye" [...] of the Speaker, which is done by standing and sitting immediately before the prime minister gives an answer.|$|R
2500|$|The Indian Councils Act 1909 (popularly {{called as}} [...] "Minto-Morley Reforms"), officially {{introduced}} {{the method of}} electing members to the Council. But it did not provide for direct election of the members. It abolished automatic official (executive) majorities in the Council and gave its members the power to move resolutions upon matters of general public interest and the budget and also to ask <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions.</b> There were a total of 21 elected members and 21 nominated members. The Act allowed up to 16 nominated members to be official and the remaining five were required to be non-officials. The Governor was also authorised to nominate two experts whenever necessary. As before, the Governor, his two executive council members and the Advocate-General were also members of the Council. P. Kesava Pillai, A. S. Krishna Rao, N. Krishnaswami Iyengar, B. N. Sarma, B. V. Narasimha Iyer, K. Perraju Pantulu, T. V. Seshagiri Iyer, P. Siva Rao, V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, P. Theagaraya Chetty and Yakub Hasan Sait were among the active members.|$|E

50|$|There is a 45-second {{time limit}} for {{questions}} and a four-minute time limit for answers in the House of Representatives. In the Senate, a questioner may ask an initial question and two <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> {{related to their}} initial question. Each question has a one-minute time limit. Answers to initial questions are limited to three minutes, and answers to <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> are limited to one minute. A senator may also move to 'take note' of a minister's answer after question time, allowing questioners (generally Opposition senators) {{to respond to the}} answers provided by ministers.|$|E

5000|$|In the House of Lords, {{a half-hour}} is set aside each {{afternoon}} {{at the start of}} the day's proceedings for Lords' oral questions. A peer submits a question in advance, which then appears on the Order Paper for the day's proceedings. The Lord shall say: [...] "My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper". The Minister responsible then answers the question. The Lord is then allowed to ask a <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> and other peers ask further questions on the theme of the original put down on the order paper. (For instance, if the question regards immigration, Lords can ask the Minister any question related to immigration during the allowed period).|$|R
50|$|Before {{listing the}} day's engagements, the Prime Minister {{sometimes}} extends condolences or offers congratulations after significant events. During the Iraq War, Tony Blair introduced {{the practice of}} naming any British military personnel {{who had been killed}} in service since the last time he addressed the House. The practice has been continued by Blair's successors as prime minister. After this, the MP may ask a <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> about any subject which might occupy the Prime Minister's time. Most MPs table the same engagements question and so after it has been asked for the first time, any other MPs who have tabled the same question are simply called to ask an untabled question, meaning that the Prime Minister will not know what questions will be asked.|$|R
50|$|The Question is {{addressed}} to the portfolio of the Minister receiving the question, and the questioner must ask the question as written. Once a question is asked, <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> can be asked.|$|E

50|$|If {{a member}} desires oral answer, he is {{required}} to indicate the question by putting an asterisk mark (*) before it. The questions are answered in {{the order in which}} they are printed in the list of questions put for the day. Members are restricted to three such questions for any sitting day. The questions are asked in the order listed by the member who requested it. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> can be asked for the purpose of eliciting further information on any matter of fact. The Speaker decides the number of <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> according to the importance of a question.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{refers to}} {{selected}} problems of exploitation {{in the face}} of justice. The analysis is based on the definitions of exploitation contained in the Polish Penal and Civil Codes. The main subject of our interest is the identification of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the recognition of exploitation as being unjust. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>question</b> will refer to a specific type of justice which should be considered in this case. In respect to this we should consider retributive, distributive and social justice. Another important factor in this regard is the accepted theory of value. In the considered subject we will focus on the labour theory of value. The principal problem could be reduced to questions whether the exploitation is ipso facto unjust and how these two phenomena are related to each other...|$|R
50|$|The First Minister is {{responsible}} to the Scottish Parliament for their actions and {{the actions of the}} overall Scottish Government. MSPs can scrutinise the activities of the First Minister and their Cabinet by tabling written questions or by asking oral questions in the Scottish Parliament. Direct questioning of the First Minister takes place each Thursday at noon, when Parliament is sitting. The 30-minute session enables MSPs to ask questions of the First Minister, on any issue. The leaders of the largest opposition parties have an allocation of questions and are allowed to question the First Minister each week. Opposition leaders normally ask an opening question to the First Minister, relating to their meeting with the Scottish Cabinet, or when they next expect to meet the Prime Minister, and then follow this up by asking a <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> on an issue of their choosing.|$|R
40|$|Neural {{network based}} sequence-to-sequence models in an encoder-decoder {{framework}} {{have been successfully}} applied to solve Question Answering (QA) problems, predicting answers from statements and questions. However, almost all previous models have failed to consider detailed context information and unknown states under which systems {{do not have enough}} information to answer given questions. These scenarios with incomplete or ambiguous information are very common in the setting of Interactive Question Answering (IQA). To address this challenge, we develop a novel model, employing context-dependent word-level attention for more accurate statement representations and question-guided sentence-level attention for better context modeling. We also generate unique IQA datasets to test our model, which will be made publicly available. Employing these attention mechanisms, our model accurately understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> for additional input depending on different contexts. When available, user's feedback is encoded and directly applied to update sentence-level attention to infer an answer. Extensive experiments on QA and IQA datasets quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with significant improvement over state-of-the-art conventional QA models.

5|$|During {{her maiden}} speech on 17 May 1999, Lamont {{was the first}} MSP to use Gaelic at a sitting of the Parliament. She served {{on a number of}} the Parliament's {{committees}} during her first term in office, including the Equal Opportunities Committee, the Local Government Committee and the Social Justice Committee. She became convener of the Social Justice Committee in 2001. In 2000 she became the first Labour MSP to rebel against the Labour-led administration when she threatened to lead backbenchers in voting against a planned Scottish Executive attempt to block the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill, which had been introduced by Sheridan. The move resulted in the withdrawal of the amendment, and a crucial parliamentary vote in favour of the legislation. At a session of First Minister's Questions in 2002, she narrowly avoided becoming the first MSP to be ejected from the parliament after continuing to speak when Presiding Officer David Steel had told her to sit down. Steel felt her <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> about youth crime was too long, but the incident led to a heated parliamentary debate, and accusations from Lamont's colleague, Labour's Helen Eadie that the Presiding Officer was not treating male and female MSPs equally, an allegation he rejected.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} ability of a cohort of junior {{hospital}} doctors to interpret ECGs which have immediate clinical relevance and influence subsequent management of patients. METHODS: 57 junior hospital doctors were interviewed and asked to complete a standard questionnaire which included eight ECGs for interpretation and a <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> relating to the administration of thrombolytic treatment. Each doctor was assessed over a 48 h period while they performed their daily clinical duties. RESULTS: The major abnormality of anterior myocardial infarction was recognised by almost all doctors. There was difficulty in the interpretation of posterior myocardial infarction and second degree heart block. Most myocardial infarctions would have been given satisfactory thrombolysis, but there was a reluctance to use this treatment in patients with posterior myocardial infarction and left bundle brach block. A few patients without myocardial infarction would have received thrombolytic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: There is varying ability among junior hospital doctors in the interpretation of the emergency electrocardiogram. The results are of concern as poor interpretation of the ECG can result in inappropriate management. As a result of {{the findings of this study}} it is proposed to introduce more formal training in the interpretation of clinically relevant ECG abnormalities for junior hospital doctors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{tells the}} story and {{conclusions}} of a 1 year research project which took place over the calendar year of 2006. It was undertaken within a local government authority (or Local Authority–LA) in the UK. The specific research question to be answered was: 'Can the application of systems methods in the LA aid Authority staff in developing and enhancing their professional practice?ï¿½ A <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> arising was: 'Can such learning be of wider value to other sections {{of the public sector}} (for example in other regions of local government or the health sector) ?ï¿½ In the process of the year 91 separate action research interactions took place. The research comes to three systemically linked findings: Firstly, LA middle managers are often caught between two realities [...] . strategic initiatives and operational demands. In the gap between these two realities they experience change in many guises but most critically in terms of government directives, ICT initiatives and restructuring. Despite this complexity managers did not appear to always have adequate tools to deal with issues arising in their context. Secondly, an assessment matrix developed originally at the Open University is a valuable tool for assessing the systemisism and reflective capacities of staff and, thirdly, a new, blended hybrid training programme to develop systemic reflective practitioners able to manage across the strategy/operations gap was developed and pilot tested in 2007. This programme shows signs of providing enhanced professional practice and, at the time of writing, is being further piloted with a view to establishing its wider applicability within the public sector...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the fifth}} and final year in civil {{engineering}} at University of Agder, this master’s thesis has been composed. This report was written during the spring semester of 2017. The purpose of this thesis was to dimension a slim balcony in UHPFRC. Nor Element {{wanted to be able}} to produce slim balconies in their own production facilities. Nor Element is currently producing balconies, but these have thicker cross sections. This master’s thesis involves a literature study and a dimension process. In the literature study the relevant guidelines and Eurocodes are presented. The study contains relevant formulas and recommendations needed to dimension a balcony in UHPFRC. Since there is no Norwegian Standard for how to design with UHPFRC, the French standard NF P 18 - 710 are considered. For this master’s thesis, the following problem statement was created: «Dimensioning of balcony in UHPFRC. » A more detailed research question was also constructed: “How slim cross-section would be possible to achieve while designing a balcony in UHPFRC?” In addition to the research <b>question,</b> a <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> was added: “Why should UHPFRC be used instead of normal concrete?” Calculations were made according to the French standard for UHPFRC, and a regulation from AFGC in France. The results from the calculations showed that a cross-section of 100 mm would be possible to achieve. Considering only the geometry, a cross-section of 96 mm would be possible to achieve. Calculations for this cross-section would have to be checked. That it is possible to achieve a cross-section of 100 mm using UHPFRC, is an acceptable motive to use UHPFRC instead of traditional concrete...|$|R

40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{economic}} crisis on the Czech housing market were, at least till now, relatively moderate. In comparison to other developed countries (e. g. Ireland, Spain, Greece, USA, Denmark, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia or Bulgaria) was {{the decrease in}} residential property prices only gradual and the default rate is lagging behind {{the average of the}} developed countries. The volatility in residential property prices could follow the accumulation of systemic risks of owner-occupied housing, especially the growing share of low-income households with mortgage debts among home-owners. The article therefore aims to answer following research questions. First, was there significant increase in the share of low-income households repaying their mortgages in the owner- occupied housing sector in the Czech Republic after 2005 ? Second, was there significant increase in ‘innovative’ mortgage products (e. g. interest-only mortgages, mortgages denominated in foreign currencies etc.) on the Czech mortgage market after 2005 ? <b>Supplementary</b> <b>question</b> was, whether balanced housing market, i. e. housing market with significant share of rental housing, {{could be one of the}} reasons of lower volatility in residential property prices, in comparison to housing market oriented mainly toward owner-occupied housing. The analysis showed that the hypothesis about sharply growing share of low-income households repaying mortgages in the owner-occupied housing sector in the Czech Republic after 2005 can be rejected. Also the share of ‘innovative’ mortgage products in the portfolios of Czech mortgage lenders seems to be rather negligible. Therefore we concluded that there is no evidence about significant accumulation of systemic risks on the Czech housing market. Moreover, the comparison of impacts of economic crisis in selected countries showed that balanced housing market could pose the best protection against negative impacts of economics crisis and against increased volatility in residential property prices...|$|R
