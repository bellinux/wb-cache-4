40|$|Individualisation and {{digitalisation}} {{are increasing}} in importance {{which leads to}} a change in the society, affecting consumers’ behaviour and needs. This change results in consumers desiring an individualised consumption experience with additional services that fashion companies should consider in order to stay relevant. This development opens up for new opportunities regarding business models such as the business model of <b>subscription</b> <b>services.</b> The identified gap in the academic literature of <b>subscription</b> <b>services</b> lies in the application of this business model to the fashion industry. Non-academic articles about fashion <b>subscription</b> <b>services</b> were found but often from the industries’ point of view rather than from the consumers’ point of view. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} is to investigate the consumers’ perspective on fashion <b>subscription</b> <b>services</b> and what underlying reasons there might be for these perspectives. The study is of quantitative nature with theories regarding <b>subscription</b> <b>services,</b> consumer behaviour and fashion forming the research questions and thus the research. Data was collected by an online questionnaire to gain insight on respondents’ perspectives on fashion <b>subscription</b> <b>services</b> which was used as descriptive empiricism, tested for correlations and discussed in line with the theories. The study shows that there are correlations between the theories and the respondents’ interest in fashion <b>subscription</b> <b>services,</b> but the interest cannot be explained by each of the theories separately. However, by looking into different affecting factors, suggestions of underlying reasons are offered by this study...|$|R

The group, who worked at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana developing games for the Gamer's Edge video game <b>subscription</b> <b>service</b> and disk magazine, was composed of programmers John Romero and John Carmack, designer Tom Hall, artist Adrian Carmack, and manager Jay Wilbur. After the release of Vorticons in December, {{and the arrival of}} the first US$10,500 royalty check from shareware publisher Apogee Software, the team quit Softdisk and started their own company, id Software. As part of the settlement with Softdisk—made because the team had created the game on their work computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack's house on the weekends—they agreed to make a series of games for Softdisk's Gamer's Edge <b>subscription</b> <b>service.</b> As the team began to explore creating another set of Commander Keen games, they made a prototype game for Softdisk, Commander Keen in Keen Dreams, to fulfill their obligations while also helping improve the next full set of Keen games.|$|E

Vekovius initially proposed a joint venture between the team and Softdisk, which fell apart when the other employees of the firm threatened to quit in response, and after a few weeks of negotiation the team agreed to produce a series of games for Gamer's Edge, one every two months. Ideas from the Deep, now founded as id Software, used some of these games to prototype ideas for their own releases, such as Catacomb 3-D. In late spring of 1991 they worked on a new Keen game in order to develop new systems for their next major release in the Commander Keen series. They did not initially want to do a Keen game for Softdisk, but eventually decided that doing so would let them fulfill their obligations while also helping improve the next full set of games for Apogee.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, John Carmack, a game {{programmer}} for the Gamer's Edge {{video game}} <b>subscription</b> <b>service</b> and disk magazine at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana, developed {{a way to}} create graphics which could smoothly scroll in any direction in a computer game. At the time, IBM-compatible general-purpose computers {{were not able to}} replicate the common feat of video game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, which were capable of redrawing the entire screen fast enough for a side-scrolling video game due to their specialized hardware. Carmack created adaptive tile refresh: a way to slide the majority of the visible screen to the side both horizontally and vertically when the player moved as if it had not changed, and only redraw the newly-visible portions of the screen. Other games had previously redrawn the whole screen in chunks, or like Carmack's earlier games were limited to scrolling in one direction. He discussed the idea with coworker Tom Hall, who encouraged him to demonstrate it by recreating the first level of the recent Super Mario Bros. 3 on a computer. The pair did so in a single overnight session, with Hall recreating the graphics of the game—replacing the player character of Mario with Dangerous Dave, a character from an eponymous previous Gamer's Edge game—while Carmack optimized the code. The next morning on September 20, the resulting game, Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement, was shown to their other coworker John Romero. Romero recognized Carmack's idea as a major accomplishment: Nintendo {{was one of the most}} successful companies in Japan, largely due to the success of their Mario franchise, and the ability to replicate the gameplay of the series on a computer could have large implications.|$|E
