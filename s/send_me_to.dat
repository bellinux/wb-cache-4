Outside of court, LaRouche denied all the charges, calling them [...] "an all-out frame-up by a state and federal task force," [...] {{and said that the}} federal government was trying to kill him. [...] "The purpose of this frame-up is not to <b>send</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> prison. It's to kill me," [...] LaRouche said. [...] "In prison it's fairly easy to kill me ... If this sentence goes through, I'm dead." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 6, 2017, in {{an e-mail}} to supporters, Warren {{announced}} that she would be running for a second term as US Senator from Massachusetts. She wrote in the e-mail, [...] "The people of Massachusetts didn't <b>send</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Washington to roll over and play dead while Donald Trump and his team of billionaires, bigots, and Wall Street bankers crush the working people of our Commonwealth and this country," [...] and [...] "This is no time to quit." ...|$|E
500|$|Washington's party reached Fort LeBoeuf on December 11, in {{the middle}} of a raging snowstorm. [...] The French commander, Captain Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, {{received}} them with hospitality; however, in response to Dinwiddie's demands, he pointed out that the letter was more properly addressed to his superior, New France's governor the Marquis Duquesne. [...] The letter Legardeur drafted in response to Dinwiddie's was clear and to the point: [...] "as to the summons you <b>send</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it." [...] Washington took careful notes of the military arrangements at both forts before departing on December 16. [...] He was somewhat concerned by the fact that Tanacharison and his men remained behind for further discussions with the French; he wrote, [...] "I saw that every strategem which the most fruitful brain could invent, was practiced to win Half King to their interest". [...] He returned to Williamsburg after a month of difficult travel. [...] Dinwiddie had Washington's account of the expedition widely distributed to emphasize the French threat. It was printed on both sides of the Atlantic, giving Washington an international reputation.|$|E

2500|$|Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre succeeded Marin as {{commander}} of the French forces after Marin died on October 29, and he invited Washington to dine with him. Over dinner, Washington presented Saint-Pierre with the letter from Dinwiddie demanding an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country. Saint-Pierre said, [...] "As to the Summons you <b>send</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it." [...] He told Washington that France's claim to the region was superior {{to that of the}} British, since René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier.|$|E

[...] After {{his father was}} injured {{he was sent to}} Uruguay on [...] "shlihut" [...] ("outreach"), and it was there that he met Ram's mother, who is Uruguayan. [...] He has an older brother and a younger sister. They moved to Jerusalem when he was five, which is when he began playing tennis. [...] "It was tough at the beginning because I couldn't speak the language, and was fighting with people in the kindergarten who didn't understand me", said Ram. [...] "My parents decided to <b>send</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the tennis center not long after we arrived." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Congress, Barr {{became famous}} for his [...] "dour" [...] image and told constituents, [...] "You don't <b>send</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Washington to smile." [...] He also said in a radio {{interview}} [...] "If it's not in the Constitution, I won't smile". He later explained [...] "I don't consider politicians who smile to be worth {{a heck of a}} lot... all things considered, it doesn't make a dime's worth of difference if the politicians in Washington smile or not, what matters is how much of your hard-earned dollars they take to spend in pure pork". Barr said in 2010 [...] "I can see a situation where the federal government is going to bring an entire suitcase of San Francisco values to the American family, and while I would love to explain all the things that are wrong with that, the fact {{is that this is a}} corrupting, left-leaning, influence on a section of society that so many liberal elites want to see taken out of the 'red state' column. The only solution to this kind of behavior is dour and austere social conservatism, like my own". Adding to his image, Barr has frequently protested about [...] "cult hairstyles", saying [...] "I cannot abide by people who adopt a cult hairstyle, or persistently dress inappropriately for meetings with me".|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} over Sierra's suspension {{and the subsequent}} trial drew local, national and international media attention. Initial reaction to Sierra's actions from the local media was unsympathetic. This was later attributed by Sierra's lawyers and Dan Radmacher – editor of the Charleston Gazette – to Principal Mann's repetition in his comments to the Gazette of Jacob Reed's statements concerning Sierra's message. [...] Sierra claims that callers to local radio stations [...] "wanted to shoot me in the head. They wanted to <b>send</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> another country." [...] The Charleston Daily Mail praised Mann's decision, calling Sierra's [...] "thoroughly egocentric exercise" [...] of her constitutional rights [...] "tiresome". The Daily Mail expanded on its position in a July 15, 2002 editorial; while noting Justice Lewis Powell's declaration that full constitutional rights did not apply equally in school as in criminal justice, the paper commented that [...] "students do have rights {{as long as they}} are not disrupting the education of others", and that while [...] Sierra's request to form an anarchist club [...] "may have seemed bizarre and even oxymoronic", Principal Mann ought to have permitted it [...] "since it would not harm or impinge upon the rights of others". It went on to praise the jury's decision that Sierra had no constitutional right to wear her T-shirts to class or to disobey the authority of Mann but that she did have the right to express her opinions after class, calling it [...] "the essence of Americanism … a great system that makes anarchy look silly".|$|E
2500|$|On 5 October 2014, it was {{announced}} that West would be leaving the show in a [...] "dramatic" [...] storyline. Dominic Treadwell-Collins, executive producer, said of West's departure, [...] "When you have an actor of Tim's calibre joining your cast, you treasure every day that you have him - and we knew from the start that Stan's stay {{with the rest of the}} Carter family would be a finite one. But what a stay - and as we draw towards Stan's exit from the show, the audience should get ready as one of Britain's finest actors pulls out all the stops and gives his King Lear..." [...] It was reported on 2 November 2014 that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) would grow suspicious of Stan's whereabouts and when she discovers the truth, order him to tell his family. Over a week later, it {{was announced}} that Stan would confirm he has terminal prostate cancer to his family after Babe hastily tells them at Lee's birthday meal. These scenes were praised by Prostate Cancer UK. On 20 December 2014, Dyer revealed on The Graham Norton Show that Stan would ask Mick to help him die in a new euthanasia storyline. Dyer said, [...] "I'm juggling about eight storylines at the moment. My old man is on his way out. My mother's got Alzheimer's - she's not my mother, my sister's actually my mum. My dad dying - he's not my dad, he's actually my grandad - he wants me to smother him." [...] The prostate cancer began taking its effect on Stan's health on 23 January 2015 when Stan collapses in mid-commotion. Digital Spy Sophie Dainty reported in January 2015 that the Carters would clash over Stan's request to be killed by his family as Tina agrees to helping him, but Mick firmly disagrees. Mick even informs the family of Stan's request and they strongly disagree. Stan's request was made following his collapse. West praised show bosses for handling Stan's cancer storyline the way they have and their way of handling West's decision to leave the show, [...] "They very kindly said I could have some time out and they would <b>send</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> South Africa or prison. But I suggested something finite like death so they decided it would be good for me to have a disease of which I would know about and one where it could be arranged for me to die in six months' time." ...|$|E
