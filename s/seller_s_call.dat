40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{repeated}} games in large buyer-seller networks {{in the presence of}} reputation networks via which buyers share information about past transactions. The model allows us to characterize cooperation networks - networks in which each seller cooperates (by providing high quality goods) with every buyer that is connected to her. To this end, we provide conditions under which: [1] the incentives of a <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> to cooperate depend only on her beliefs with respect to her local neighborhood - a subnetwork that includes <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> and is of a size that is independent {{of the size of the}} entire network; and [2] the incentives of a <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> to cooperate can be calculated as if the network was a random tree with <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> at its root. Our characterization sheds light on the welfare costs of relying only on repeated interactions for sustaining cooperation, and on how to mitigate such costs.

To study the extent of strategic behavior, we use an experimental design that elicits bidders complete bid functions in each round (auction) of the experiment. In the aggregate, behavior is consistent with the basic equilibrium predictions for risk neutral or homogenous risk averse bidders (extent of bid shading, average <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> revenues and deviations from equilibrium). However, {{when we look at the}} extent of best reply behavior and the shape of bid functions, we find that individual behavior is not in line with the received equilibrium models, although it exhibits strategic sophistication. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Non-repudiation of {{a mobile}} payment {{transaction}} ensures {{that when a}} buyer (B) sends some messages to a <b>seller</b> (<b>S),</b> neither B nor S can deny having partic-ipated in this transaction. An evidence of a transaction is generated by wireless PKI (WPKI) mechanism such that B and S cannot repudiate sending and receiving the purchase order respectively. Broker generates a mobile agent for B which carries en-crypted purchase order to S. A trusted third party (TTP) acts as a lightweight notary for evidence generations. One advantage of this agent-based non-repudiation proto-col is to reduce inconvenience for mobile clients such as connection time and search for suitable merchant servers, etc.; it provides necessary security mechanisms for fair mobile payment transactions...|$|R

When the prize has a common-value component, a bidder competing in an ascending auction against an advantaged competitor bids especially cautiously and, hence, the advantaged bidder wins most of the time. However, contrary to what is often argued, a disadvantaged bidder still wins with positive probability, even if his competitor. s advantage is very large and even if the disadvantaged bidder has the lowest actual valuation ex-post. Therefore, the disadvantaged bidder has an incentive to participate in the auction, and the presence of a bidder with a small advantage does not have a dramatic e¤ect on the <b>seller.</b> <b>s</b> revenue. common-value auctions, asymmetric bidders...|$|R

This book provides a systematic analysis of the law of sale of goods with reference to UK and Commonwealth authorities and relevant UK and EU legislation. With particular clarity of expression the work covers fully content, interpretation, and performance issues relating to sale of goods agreements. Aspects of consumer law are dealt with where relevant as are issues such as recoverability of damages, currency and interest. Since the last edition there has been a substantial flow of new case law which include the following selected group: Yearworth (on body fluids); Gammasonics (software); VFS Financial Services and Welcome Financial Services (on Part III of the Hire Purchase Act); Great Elephant (on a <b>seller's</b> <b>s</b> 12 liability); Force India Formula One (s. 12 and recovery of money on a failure of consideration); The Mercini Lady (on risk and durability); damages decisions in the wake of The Achilleas; Kulkarni and Wincanton (on the passing of property); Samarenko (on making time of the essence); Brewer (description); McDonald (on examination and satisfactory quality); Lowe (Part 5 A of the Sale of Goods Act); case law under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008.

40|$|We {{argue that}} {{threshold}} trust {{is not an}} option in most of the real-life electronic auctions. After that we propose two new cryptographic Vickrey auction schemes that involve, apart from the bidders and the <b>seller</b> <b>S,</b> an auction authority A so that unless S and A collude the outcome of auctions will be correct, and moreover, S will not get any information about the bids, while A will receive bid statistics. The simple variant of our scheme is based on standard cryptographic primitives and is flexible and efficient to implement. The advanced variant is based on a coin-extractable homomorphic public-key cryptosystem. It reduces the trust requirements on A by making A's actions verifiable. Further extensions make it possible to decrease damage that colluding S and A can do. The communication complexity between the S and A in medium-size auctions is at least one order of magnitude less than in the Naor-Pinkas-Sumner scheme that was the only previously known secure Vickrey auction scheme without threshold trust.
