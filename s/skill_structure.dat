500|$|In {{terms of}} labour process theory—the attempt to {{understand}} the relationship between management control, worker skill and wages in industrial workplaces—Filtzer emphasised the continuing absence of control by Soviet workers over their own labour process. The Soviet elite would not radically change the labour process by democratising it and introducing truly equal wages for everyone in society, but nor could they generate the culture of consumerism that in the West was used to help explain the wage and <b>skill</b> <b>structure.</b> [...] In these circumstances, attempts to coordinate production quotas, wages and expected levels of worker effort failed and continued to fail into the 1980s. [...] The wage reform of 1956–1962 was a failure, as it could neither fix nor improve the economic conflict between workers and the elite in the Soviet Union. [...] On the shop floor, workers continued to directly bargain with low-level management over effort, wages and what [...] "skill" [...] they would exert. In particular, Filtzer notes that Soviet workers were constantly forced into a position of exerting more skill than was officially called for in plans or quotas. This was because Soviet workers often had to find their own ways of working around problems that made their efforts difficult, such as building their own tools to carry out tasks that could not be performed with the tools provided, or by devising entirely new production processes of their own when existing processes were not suitable. This was a condition only seen to such an extent in the West in industries that were insulated from market forces. Because this was common in Soviet industry, workers and managers in the Soviet Union had many reasons to work together in the setting of wages, quotas and skill expectations, even after the wage reform. Filtzer wrote that Mikhail Gorbachev attempted a very similar series of wage reforms in 1986 (Perestroika), which ultimately failed and had to be replaced with a decentralised system in 1991.|$|E

30|$|It is {{difficult}} to generalize the impact of liberalization of migration on <b>skill</b> <b>structure</b> of immigrants in Sweden to other countries or other periods.

Nonetheless, the results indicate that for countries with a negative selection of migrants, liberalization of migration may {{have a negative effect on}} the <b>skill</b> <b>structure</b> of their new immigrants in the short-run, which they may need to prepare for.

40|$|In Germany, the <b>skill</b> <b>structure</b> {{of wages}} {{remained}} stable {{in the last}} two decades while employment of the low skilled deteriorated considerably relative to employment of the high skilled. This paper analyses the impact of technical progress on the <b>skill</b> <b>structure</b> of employment and wages by means of an insider-outsider-variant of a right-to-manage model. While wages of high skilled employees is determined on a competitive labor market, wages for all other skill groups are subject to a Nash bargaining between unions and the firms. The econometric evidence presented is based on West German manufacturing data at the one-digit level. A semi-structural model is estimated which is sufficiently flexible to be regarded as a second order approximation of a general union preference function. The approach enables us to identify the indirect effects of technical progress on employment resulting from the bargaining process. These indirect effects prove to be quantitatively important. In some industries job losses due to technical progress for the low skilled relative to the high skilled are generated through counter acting wage policies. The findings support the view that insider-outsider mechanisms are operating on the German labor market. <b>Skill</b> <b>structure,</b> technological progress, flexible functional form...|$|E
40|$|In recent {{publications}} it {{has been}} argued that the change of the <b>skill</b> <b>structure</b> of industrial employment is caused by biased technical progress rather than by increasing international trade with low wage countries. However, in linking prices for final goods with prices of primary factors, most empirical studies have only dealt with international trade in final goods and have thereby neglected the impact of international outsourcing. In this paper it is argued that outsourcing can be understood as a substitution of imported intermediate inputs for domestic value added, and that such substitution may have an impact on the <b>skill</b> <b>structure</b> of domestic employment in favor of skilled labor. The empirical evidence for German manufacturing industries supports this hypothesis. International Outsourcing, Trade, Wages, Employment. ...|$|E

40|$|Much of the {{dramatic}} change in skill and wage structure observed {{in recent years in}} the United States is believed to stem from the impact of new technology. This paper compares the changing <b>skill</b> <b>structure</b> of wages and employment in the United States with three other advanced developed countries - the UK (where wage inequality has risen even faster in the 1980 s than in the US), Denmark (where unemployment has risen, but wage inequality but not grown very much) and Sweden (where wage inequality and unemployment has remained has remained stable over our sample). We base most of our analysis on a newly constructed panel of two-digit industries covering 17 years but also, where necessary, use other data sources at various levels of aggregation. We investigate how far technical change can explain the growth of the share of skilled workers (by occupation or education) has occurred in all countries. Like the US, most of this shift towards an increased usage of more skilled workers has occurred within industries. Furthermore, evidence of the complementarily of human capital with physical capital and with new technology is uncovered in all four countries. Nevertheless, technology can only account for a relatively small part (about 1 / 4) of the changes in the <b>skill</b> <b>structure</b> of the labour marker in the Anglo-American nations. In Sweden, however, a substantial part of the change is accounted for by technology. It seems likely like, over and above any effect from skill biased technological change, the observed changes in <b>skill</b> <b>structure</b> in Britain and America are also linked to the structure of labourr market institutions, such as the declining role of trade unions and collective bargaining...|$|E

40|$|This project {{focuses on}} {{comparing}} the qualification structure of migrants residing in Austria {{as well as}} their over- and underqualification rates to other EU countries. The <b>skill</b> <b>structure</b> of foreign born residing in Austria has improved slightly in the last years. Austria is, however, characterised by a high share of medium skilled migrants and a low share of highly skilled migrants. In addition among the pool of migrants in the EU from a given country, Austria generally selects the less qualified. The location decisions of highly skilled migrants are mostly governed by income opportunities, labour market conditions, ethnic networks and a common official language. Over- and under-qualification rates among the foreign born in Austria largely accord with the European average, the largest part of the differences can be explained by differences in qualification and country structure between the foreign born in Austria and the EU. Native-foreign born differentials in employment rates are, however, significantly higher in Austria than in other EU countries.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} changes in the <b>skill</b> <b>structure</b> of labour demand using panel data on Finnish private sector establishments, with linked {{information}} on worker characteristics. We also examine whether directly observable measures of technological change and trade explain {{the changes in}} <b>skill</b> <b>structure</b> of Finnish manufacturing sector plants' work force. Worker's skill level is defined by both education and age. The data on Finnish private sector establishments for years 1988 - 1998 reveal that the <b>skill</b> <b>structure</b> of work force has shifted towards highly educated and older. The increase in the share of both highly and less educated older workers has mainly occurred within establishments while the increase in the share of younger highly educated workers has occurred between establishments and by entry of new establishments. The decomposition analysis by plant characteristics reveals that the increase in the share of highly educated younger workers is attributed to relative increase in employment of exporting and R&D intensive plants, while the increase in the share of older workers has occurred equally within all plants. The panel estimation results without plant controls show that increase in the selected technology variables, industry- and firm-level R&D intensity increases significantly the demand for highly educated younger workers while the impact of this variables is much less pronounced or even insignificant for older highly educated workers. However, the fixed effects estimation results provide no evidence that R&D intensity would {{have an impact on the}} within-plant changes in the skill mix. With respect to the export-share variable the estimation results provide some evidence that trade decreases the demand for older workers. Endast sammandrag.
