40|$|The paper investigates typical Baltic sea-shore sand along Klaipėda and diagnoses {{the level}} of {{particle}} crushing after different loading steps. An oedometer test is done applying to drained loose (e 0 = 0, 764) and dense (e 0 = 0, 604) sand. The used loading steps are 0, 0; 200, 0; 400, 0; 600, 0; 800, 0 kPa. Investigation into {{the level of}} particle crushing is made conducting a <b>sieve</b> <b>test</b> employing spherical balls on the sieves of a different size. The <b>sieve</b> <b>test</b> is done following different loading levels. The results of the grading curve show that 800, 0 kPa vertical stress does not crushes the particles of the oedometer sample. The analysis of the compression results of loose and dense sand shows that a determined immediate settlement of sample appears when vertical stress makes from 50, 0 kPa to 120, 0 kPa and where immediate settlement values {{do not belong to}} the density of the sand sample.

40|$|The {{productivity}} {{and quality of}} malting barley were evaluated using factorial combinations of four preceding crops: faba bean, field pea, rapeseed and barley as main plots, and four nitrogen fertilizer rates (0, 18, 36 and 54 kg N ha- 1) as sub-plots with three replications, at two sites on Nitisols of the Ethiopian highlands in 2010 and 2011 cropping seasons. Preceding crops other than barley, and N fertilizer significantly improved yield and quality of malting barley. The highest grain yield, kernel plumpness, protein content and <b>sieve</b> <b>test</b> were obtained for malting barley grown after faba bean, followed by rapeseed and field pea. Nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased yield, protein content and <b>sieve</b> <b>test</b> of malting barley. All protein contents were within the acceptable range for malting quality. Inclusion of legumes in the rotation also improved soil fertility through increases in soil carbon and nitrogen content. We conclude that to maximize yield and quality of malting barley {{it is critical to}} consider the preceding crop and soil nitrogen status.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{masticatory}} performance (MP) {{of patients with}} old removable partial denture (RPD), recently inserted RPD and already adapted RPD {{by means of the}} simple <b>sieve</b> <b>test.</b> Material and Methods: Twenty-nine adult (> 18 years old) volunteer patients were recruited, with lower and upper RPD, excluding total edentulous subjects in the upper and lower jaw, with temporomandibular disorders, severe periodontal disease, mental disability or systemic disease compromising the masticatory or nervous system. Dentures were designed and fabricated by an expert operator. MP was evaluated in old RPD (MP 1), recently inserted RPD (MP 2) and adapted RPD (MP 3). The simple <b>sieve</b> <b>test</b> used was Edlund-Lamm in percentage of MP, using Optosil® Comfort condensation silicone tablets, with standard sizes (5. 0 x 20 mm). In each phase, the patient chewed the tablet with 20 masticatory strokes. The crushed fragments were dried at 80 °C for 60 minutes and weighed on an analytical scale. A multiple vibration sieve analysis was performed, using sieves with opening sizes of 2. 8 mm and 1. 4 mm. Shapiro-Wilk test and Anova test with Bonferroni correction were performed. Results: It was observed that MP 1 presented a mean of 8. 40 % (SD± 5. 59), MP 2 a mean of 8. 56 % (SD± 5. 56), and MP 3 a mean of 18. 26 % (SD± 8. 12). There was a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the MP 1 -MP 3 groups, as well as between the MP 2 -MP 3 (p< 0. 05).

30|$|The <b>sieve</b> <b>test</b> {{required}} oven-dried sand samples; however, {{when the}} sand sample {{is mixed with}} cement paste as a mortar, the oven-dried sand sample absorbs the mixing water. Hence, {{it was necessary to}} determine the absorption rate to calculate the saturated but surface dry (SSD) condition of each sample. Furthermore, since smaller sizes of fine aggregates have higher specific surface areas, fine aggregate samples with the smaller mean size absorbed more water than the larger fine aggregates. This relates to the solid concentration of mortar and its need for a water-to-cement ratio. When this ratio is properly applied, it gives the mortar a higher yield stress and viscosity. The absorption ratio of each fine aggregate sample was evaluated based on ASTM C 128 (ASTM International 2015). Table  2 lists the fine aggregate samples’ absorption rates. The absorption ratio increased as the mean size of the fine aggregate sample decreased, as expected. Notably, for G 0.34, about 7.26 % of the highest absorption was observed.|$|E

40|$|Fine {{aggregate}} {{is one of}} {{the essential}} components in concrete and significantly influences the material properties. As parts of natures, physical characteristics of fine aggregate are highly relevant to its behaviors in concrete. The most of previous studies are mainly focused on the physical properties of coarse aggregate due to the equipment limitations. In this paper, two typical fine aggregates, i. e. river sand and crushed rock, are selected for shape characterization. The new developed digital image analysis systems are employed as the main approaches for the purpose. Some other technical methods, e. g. <b>sieve</b> <b>test,</b> laser diffraction method are also used for the comparable references. Shape characteristics of fine aggregates with different origins but in similar size ranges are revealed by this study. Compared with coarse aggregate, fine grains of different origins generally have similar shape differences. These differences are more significant in surface texture properties, which can be easily identified by an advanced shape parameter: bluntness. The new image analysis method is then approved to be efficient for the shape characterization of fine aggregate in concrete...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The major {{components}} of wheat flour are keys to its functionality in processing and product quality. The {{major components}}, {{other than the}} lipids, are polymers: starch, protein, and non-starchy polysaccharides (NSP). In wheat NSP are primarily arabinoxylans (AX). These components are compartmentalized in the grain but are forced into close contact after the disruption caused by the milling process. These components further interact once water {{is added to the}} flour to create doughs and batters. It is these interactions and the water holding capacities of these polymeric components that are the unifying thread for most of this dissertation, other than the inclusion of nutritional traits in chapters 6 and 7. This dissertation consists of three independent studies, the last of which had two parts. Study one was "Effect of carbonate on co-extraction of arabinoxylans (AX) with glutenin macropolymer (GMP) ". The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if the level of AX in GMP increased under alkaline extraction conditions compared to extractions done in water. The amount of wet GMP obtained from alkaline extraction was greater than that from water extraction. Hard wheats had overall higher GMP wet weights than soft wheats. The level of AX in GMP extracted under alkaline conditions was greater than that in GMP extracted with water and the amount of increase was generally higher in soft wheats. Study two was "Optimization of water addition to noodle doughs". The aim of this study was to determine if a lubricated squeezing flow (LSF) technique could be useful in determination of optimum water addition to noodle doughs. Comparing the LSF method with alternative methods (Mixograph and <b>sieving</b> <b>test),</b> optimum water additions predicted by LSF for both salted and alkaline soft-wheat derived noodle doughs were equivalent or slightly higher than those predicted by the Mixograph and <b>sieving</b> <b>test.</b> For both salted and alkaline hard-wheat derived noodle doughs, optimum water additions predicted by the LSF method were substantial higher than those predicted by the Mixograph but equivalent or slightly higher than those predicted by the <b>sieving</b> <b>test.</b> Relaxation time was the most useful parameter in determining optimum water addition for the soft-wheat noodle doughs. The LSF method in its current form was found to be not adequate for all noodle types. Additional work with LSF parameters altered to improve sensitivity and with more of samples should be performed. Study three was "Determination of wheat quality and quantitative trait locus analysis". Part 1 was to measure a comprehensive set of quality phenotypes (including nutritional parameters) on a wheat population derived from the cross Tubbs [soft] x NSA 98 - 0995 [hard]; (T x N). Part 2 was to identify if there were quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with the traits determined in part 1. Considerable and transgressive segregation was observed for many of the studied traits. The transgressive segregation could useful, in that lines with superior soft-wheat quality can be identified that could be introduced quickly into the wheat breeding program from this elite x elite cross. Hardness index was significantly correlated with several important traits related to the solvent absorption capacity of the flour. Composite interval mapping detected a total of significant 28 QTLs on 10 wheat chromosomes for 15 end-use quality and nutrition traits in 2 harvest years. QTLs for total antioxidant activity (TAA) and total phenolic content (TPC) were identified for the first time. QTLs for TAA were on chromosomes 3 B and 5 BS, while the QTL for TPC was on chromosome 7 AC. Hybridization between Tubbs and NSA surprisingly produced superior soft-wheat quality with potentially higher in nutritional values. The QTLs identified in this study could be useful in marker-assisted selection for future pre-selection of progeny from Tubbs or NSA...|$|R

Much of the new production is situated in first-rotation forests that are located on steep terrain and have minimal existing forest road networks. A survey conducted as part of this study identified that current road engineering practices vary widely between forest owners and that forest road construction owes more to the experience of roading supervisors than to formal design methods, qualifications and training. While the economical design of forest roads is affected by many factors, including: road location and surveying, geometric design, and construction and maintenance, the acquisition and placement of aggregates for pavement can contribute 60 - 70 % of forest road cost. The majority of forest owners use a single ‘improved’ aggregate layer to complete their forest road, as opposed to a multi-layered approach used for most public roads. This paper focuses on reviewing the aggregate grading standards available for forest road design, and notes there is considerable variation between standards.

The flowability, segregation stability, and passing ability of the self-consolidating concrete mixtures were evaluated using slump flow <b>test,</b> <b>sieve</b> segregation <b>test</b> and U-box test respectively. It was found that at the same level of flowability, the superplasticizer demand increases with the content of silica fume. Compared with concrete produced with pure cement, incorporation of 5 % silica fume in the concrete mixtures reduces the segregation stability and passing ability of the concrete, but the reduction is less significant when the silica fume content is increased to 10 %. On the other hand, incorporation of 25 % fly ash in the concrete mixture improves both the segregation stability and passing ability, but the mixtures require higher superplasticizer dosage for a given flowability. Finally, the design considerations for self-consolidating concrete are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to produce milk powder from Ettawa-crossbred goat milk and subsequently evaluate the quality of the products. The raw material used was Ettawa-crossbred goat fresh milk with total solid, lactose, fat, and protein content of 15. 93 %, 4. 2 %, 4. 8 % and 4. 7 %, respectively. Milk with final total solid of 17. 5 % and 20 % were prepared for spray drying by adding skim milk powder. Drying was carried out using a spray dryer type Lamp having nozzle size of 0. 05 mm with an inlet temperature of 90 °C and an outlet temperature of 45 °C. Parameters observed were chemical, physical and microbiological qualities. The data showed that milk powder produced from Ettawa-crossbred goat milk had water content of 1. 5 - 1. 7 %. Further analysis showed that the acidity, proteins, lactose, and fat content were 0. 90 %, 28. 4 %, 21. 7 %, and 22. 5 %, respectively. The physical analysis showed that milk powder produced from Ettawa-crossbred goat milk had a higher wettability score (143 seconds) as compared to that of commercial products (29 seconds), a higher <b>sieve</b> <b>test</b> score (0. 6 g vs 0. 004 g), but similar index of insolubility (1. 4 ml vs. 1. 6 ml). The microbiological analysis showed that the Total Plate Count (TPC), Enterobacteriaceae (EB) and presumptive coliforms increased during storage either in refrigerator or room temperature. The increase in TPC, EB and coliforms was substantially higher when products were kept at room temperature than in refrigerator. In conclusion, Ettawa-crossbred goat milk powder had a good nutrition quality, but still need improvement for the physicochemical characteristic including wettability and nutritional enrichment for vitamins and minerals by means of fortification...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to adapt an {{economical}} hydraulic structure design to an ungaged watershed. A dangerous drop in the streambed formed 35 ft. away from a residential bridge. The drop is inching closer to the culvert bridge causing serious concern. Streambed erosion is a damaging force that can cause damage to bridge and hydraulic structures. EPA Basin software was used to delineate the watershed containing the target bridge for the study. Simulation software such as HEC HMS to first model different design storms to get watershed data and HEC RAS to simulate the stage discharge at the target bridge location. Both simulation software’s were also used to model known storm data from the 2008 Ike Storm as a comparison to gage the watershed. The ungaged watershed was also compared to three surrounding watersheds using daily flow observation data at the following stations: Hart Ditch, Deep River, and Little Calumet to calculate proportioned 25 yr. storm flow discharge using Weibul’s plotting position formula. Through different data comparisons, the computer simulation flow data for a 25 yr. storm of 393. 1 CFS. Computer simulation flow data was also compared with National Streamflow Statistic (NSS) software, which computed a discharge 212. 24 CFS. x The ranges of values High, Medium, and Low were developed in order to establish an optimal design range that will be economical as well as fit the existing site conditions. Multiple types of field data was gathered over the course of the study such as cross sectional and topographic survey data for computer simulations, <b>sieve</b> <b>test</b> data or determining soil gradation of the streambed and embankments, and digital flow data for hydraulic structure design. Data gathered over the course of the study helped determine that a riprap energy dissipator should be adapted for the site because of environmental conditions and economics. Along with dissipator design, an alternative construction plan was also outlined. ...|$|E
40|$|Chitosan has amine and amino {{groups which}} {{have the ability to}} {{generate}} cationic type surfactants when combine with H+ ions. Thus its action as a cationic emulsifier is suitable for negatively charged siliceous aggregates used for road paving in Sri Lanka. This study consisted of two parts. Firstly, water soluble Chitosan was tested for suitability of using as an emulsifier in the production of cationic bituminous emulsions and secondly Chitosan was used as an additive to mix with bitumen emulsion. In the first part, currently using amine emulsifier was replaced at 20 % intervals and tested for emulsion properties; emulsion viscosity, storage stability, settlement test, <b>sieve</b> <b>test</b> and breaking of emulsion. In the second part, Chitosan was added to emulsion and viscosity, storage stability and break time were tested. Results of first part indicated that Chitosan replacement was only possible up to 10 % replacement for cationic slow setting type of emulsions but rheological properties of rapid setting emulsions could be improved by replacing up to 60 % of amine emulsifier with Chitosan. A significant increase in viscosity from 16 SSU (with 0 % Chitosan) to 43 SSU (with 60 % Chitosan) was observed for rapid setting emulsions. Storage Stability showed the optimum value of zero at 40 % replacement and all the values up to 60 % replacement were found to be within the ASTM specified level of ± 1 %. Break time measurements suggested that for slow setting type emulsions Chitosan use as an emulsifier has increased the emulsion breaking rate. Further high viscous and stable rapid setting emulsion could be obtained without hindering the compliance to ASTM standard by replacing the amine emulsifier with Chitosan. Results of second part suggested that Chitosan acts as a viscosity modifier and increases the emulsion viscosity from 26 SSU to 92 SSU when added at 0. 2 % of emulsion weight. But this addition has increased the settling tendency of emulsion thus most suited to be mixed at the point of use. In both cases, at a critical amount of added Chitosan was observed. This maximum limit was found to be 0. 2 % (w/w) ...|$|E

The molecular <b>sieves</b> <b>tested</b> for adsorption of these gases were 4 A and 5 A zeolite, 13 X and a CaX zeolite, H-mordenite, a natural clinoptilolite and a carbon molecular sieve. The gas chromatographic method {{was used for}} all equilibrium measurements. Upon choosing the promising CO/N 2 /clinoptilolite system for further studies, kinetic (diffusion) characteristics {{of each of these}} pure gases in the clinoptilolite ports was examined between 323 and 423 K using the gas chromatographic method. Pure gas and binary gas adsorption isotherms for the CO/N 2 /clinoptilolite system were determined up to 1 atmosphere pressure at 303 K using the gas chromatographic method. Pure isotherms were fit with the Lanpmuir and Vacancy Solution Theory models. Pure gas modelling results were used to predict and compared to the experimentally determined binary gas isotherms. Separation of polar compounds from non-polar compounds was facilitated by inclusion of divalent cations in the zeolite micropores. Clinoptilolite showed great promise for various separations. The chromatographic method for measuring adsorption isotherms is limited in the measurement of rectangular isotherms, yielding errors dependant upon the accuracy of the gas blending system. The Wilson form of the VST accurately predicts the binary adsorption data...|$|R
