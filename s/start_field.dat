40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{starts with}} the following problem. If one uses the parabolic approximation of the wave equation, the user is required to provide initial data or a <b>starting</b> <b>field.</b> Although {{it is well known}} that the correct <b>starting</b> <b>field</b> involves normal modes, alternative approaches are often used because they are more readily computed. ^ In the following a matrix equation is derived using the perturbation approach which governs the special combination of normal modes that gives the <b>starting</b> <b>field.</b> ^ Further, a methodology is developed which allows the closeness of two <b>starting</b> <b>fields</b> to be measured. This methodology is demonstrated using several contemporary <b>starting</b> <b>fields.</b> ^ In addition, efficient methods for solving the matrix equation which governs the normal modes are explored. These methods involve finding the $-$ 1 / 4 power of a matrix which is generated from the fast Fourier transform of one of the coefficients of the partial differential equation. ...|$|R

5000|$|At any time, {{although}} {{typically in}} response to an error by the device during a SYNC field, the host may abort the current transaction by driving LFRAME# low without waiting for the current transaction to end. It must hold it low for at least 4 cycles, then return it high with a special <b>START</b> <b>field</b> value of 1111. This performs a soft reset of the LPC bus and leaves the bus idle until the next transfer is commenced by driving LFRAME# low again.|$|E

[...] During the first cycle with LFRAME# high again, the host drives a [...] "cycle type/direction" [...] (CTDIR) field: three bits indicating the type (I/O, memory, or DMA) and direction (read from device, or write to device) of the transfer to follow.

A CPS packet is an unanchored unit {{of data that}} can cross ATM cells and can start {{from anywhere in the}} payload of the ATM cell, other than the <b>start</b> <b>field</b> (STF). The STF is the first byte of the 48-byte ATM payload. The STF gives the byte index into the ATM cell where the first CPS packet in this cell begins. Byte 0 is the STF. The data from byte 1 ... (STF+1), would be the straddled remainder of the previous ATM cell's final CPS packet. If there is no remainder from the previous cell, the STF is 0, and the first byte of the cell after the STF is also the location of the start of the first CPS packet.|$|E

They are abducted by a couple hired by a drug dealer that received a bad deal from Titus. When they return, however, the drama continues. Field keeps his relationship up with Lane, including taking her with him on a business trip to Tallahassee. Constance gets wind of Field's deception and conspires with Titus to get Lane sent out of town, but they prove unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Mary Troy, Annabelle's mother, comes to town upon learning of her daughter's violent death. She, Skipper, and Lane, {{come to the conclusion that}} the Weldon fire was an arson, though they are never quite sure who set it up. It is discovered that Annabelle was Sheriff Titus Semple's illegitimate daughter from years before after he forced himself on her mother Mary.Field goes back to drinking and is drunk on the day of an important campaign function, resulting in Constance blabbing unconfirmed information about his opponent. In the end, however, Field wins the election is made a Senator of Florida. After various fights and arguments, the Carlyles separate. Skipper, on the other hand, begins a relationship with new girl in town Christie Kovacs, who moved to Truro to live with her overbearing sister Alice who worked at the Weldon Paper Mill and who was secretly in love with Claude.Christie leaves Truro for good after being paid off for having a brief affair and then surviving a car accident with Field. Not long after Alice resigns and also leaves Truro after realizing Claude would never return her feelings. Skipper also prepares to leave town to accept a job in New Orleans, but decides to stay after Claude is seriously injured in an accident at the mill.|$|E

Observational methodology was used through a descriptive and correlational longitudinal design. The differences between an experimental group and a control group were analyzed in 160 playing micro-situations in relation to goal achievement, failure, interception and duration. There were significant differences between groups (χ²(2) = 16. 99, p<. 001; TE=. 23), finding more goals and fewer interceptions in the experimental group. Likewise, there is no statistical significance when analyzing the influence exerted by the <b>start</b> <b>field</b> position in the experimental group, which if observed in control group, who receives more goals from the left wing and more interceptions from the left flat.
