40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to attempt to develop a method to determine the strategy giving the higher probability of scoring at least one run-attempting a sacrifice bunt or batting normally (when the situational variables are essentially neutral and do not suggest a course of action). This will be done by simulating {{a large number of}} half innings in which each of the two options is used. The output of the simulations will then be used to perform two regression analyses, which will generate two equations. The first equation will equate the probability of scoring at least one run to some combination of sacrifice bunting efficiency, team batting average and team slugging percentage. The second equation will equate the probability of scoring at least one run to some combination of the potential bunter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>slugging</b> percentage, team batting average and team slugging percentage. The two equations will then be subtracted and simplified to produce one equation that equates sacrifice bunting efficiency to some combination of the potential bunter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>slugging</b> percentage, team slugging percentage and team batting average.

40|$|In {{this study}} on the oversowing of lucerne on an uncultivated sward at Massey, three trials were conducted, two {{in the field and}} one box trial under {{glasshouse}} conditions during the summer of 1975 / 76 and the autumn and early winter of 1976. The triars compared the effects of two lengths of ground cover, untreated, suppressed for a longer or shorter period with herbicides and burnt on the early establishment of lucerrne sown as bare or pelleted seed. It was found that small amounts of cover at sowing encouraged lucerne germination under high moisture conditions subsequent establishment and early survival was best on the burnt and chemically desiccated, plots. The cover was most useful where it was short (8 cm) and desiccated by long term paraquat or glyphosate treatments. Dense live cover was harmful to lucerne seedlings and smothered them within 5 weeks after sowing. Where recovery of the resident vegetation and weeds was rapid, as on the burnt and short term herbicide plots, lucerne establishnent and survivar was poor and surviviag plants were small and weak. Weed infestation was heavy both on burnt and herbicide treated plots, pointing to the need to introduce an early weed control programme with oversowing. Weeds were found to respond in a similar manner to lucerne to grass competition. In the autumn and early winter tria 1 <b>s,</b> <b>slug</b> damage was observed and this problem appeared to be of major importance under wet conditions. The effects of slugs were fourd to be most damaging during the first 4 - 5 weeks after sowing. Metaldehyde slug bait pellets were effective in reducing slug damage if applied at least twice during the establishment period of lucerne. The implications of these findings are reported and discussed with particular reference to the possibilities of oversowing under East African condition...|$|R

40|$|Surfactant {{alternating}} {{carbonated water}} (SACW) injection {{is a novel}} mode for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), a method to produce residual oil by injecting surfactant solution slug followed by carbonated water slug. Dissolving carbon dioxide (CO 2) in brine water injection may overcome the shortcomings that seriously associate with the tertiary process of CO 2 injection such as high CO 2 mobility, viscous fingering and gravity override, and poor weep efficiency. The surfactant solution (<b>S)</b> <b>slug</b> alternating carbonated water (CW) slug might reduce the gas mobility at displacement front and retard CO 2 breakthrough. In addition, surfactant and CO 2 can reduce interfacial tension between oil and water reservoir?. The sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) surfactant was used in surfactant flooding. In addition, the sand pack flooding experiments has been performed in this work. Glass beads were packed into 34. 5 cm length and 3. 8 cm diameter of stainless steel tube (sand pack) with small holes in both sides. The synthesized sodium chloride solution (brine water) and crude oil saturated the sand pack to establish S wi and S oi. Thereafter, the sand pack was aged at reservoir temperature of 60 o C and pressure of 2500 psi for 4 days to create actual oil reservoir conditions. Furthermore, different injection strategies were carried out including with different slug sizes in pore volume (PV) of SACW such as 0. 25 PV (S) followed by 0. 75 PV (CW), 0. 5 PV (S) followed by 0. 5 PV (CW) and 0. 75 PV (S) followed by 0. 25 PV (CW) {{in order to find}} out the optimum injection strategy to obtain the highest oil recovery factor. The obtained results illustrated that the scenario of 0. 75 PV of surfactant slug alternating 0. 25 PV of carbonated water showed the highest oil recovery fact or of 86. 58 %. This is may be attributed to the efficiency of surfactant slug is higher than carbonated water slug...|$|R

Rhodium,. ruthenium, strontium, titanium, {{tungsten}} or zirconium, supported on gamma alumina {{have been investigated}} for methanation reaction. The catalyst was prepared by impregnation the mixed solution of nickel nitrate and soluble salt of the additive on gamma alumina pellets. The parameters studied include minimum methanation temperature, the apparent activation energy, the reaction order, surface area, the catalytic activity, concentration profile {{and the extent of}} sulphur poisoning. The correlations between the observed values of these parameters and measurable characteristics like intermetal heat of adsorption, ionic radius, electron density and metallic radius of the additive suggest that the catalytic behaviour of the nickel-bimetallic system is, under the influence of electron effects. However, geo-metric factors are also playing some part, It has been demonstrated that reducible oxides behave better than irreducible in maintaining catalytic activity, The addition of palladium, platinum, tungsten and chromium metals, famous for hydrogen spillover, improved the performance of the catalyst, supporting the fact that local concentration of hydrogen plays some part, The kinetic data indicates that reaction orders are strongly negative for all catalysts except Ni-pt /Al 2 O 3; in this case it becomes positive at higher temperatures. The reaction orders for catalysts except Ni-Ca/al 2 o 3 become less negative with increasing temperature, suggesting a competitive adsorption of co. The impregnation profiles of Zr, Co, Rh, Ir and Mo ions on alumina pellets relative to Ni ions suggest that ions of Co, Rh, Ir and Mo, because of higher charge density and ions of Zr, for larger ionic radius as compared to Ni ions, are preferentially adsorbed of restricted at the periphery. This study establishes that with longer soaking time of increasing solution concentration, ions travel deep into pellets.

Increase in rate if deactivation with increase in temperature, observed in this study, is due to temperature dependency of the site specificity, The sulphur poisoning of various promoters in this study was predominantly geometric, the extent of loss of activity being dependent upon the structural changes involved...|$|R

In all three of these plays, the relationship between work, marriage and motherhood in the lives of ordinary women takes primary focus, and the female characters created by these playwrights range from working, independent women to domestic mothers and housewives. All three of these narratives reflect the location of class as it is represented in the mainstream feminist discourse of the time. In particular, these plays demonstrate how the feminist movement, largely middle-class in its composition, related to, appropriated and ultimately submerged the interests and desires of working-class women in their own hegemonic narratives. ...|$|R

40|$|Slugging {{involves}} {{pressure and}} flowrate fluctuations and poses {{a major threat}} to optimising oil production from deepwater reserves. Typical production loss could be as high as 50 %, affecting the ability to meet growing energy demand. This work is based on numerical simulation using OLGA (OiL and GAs) a one- dimensional and two-fluid equations based commercial tool for the simulation and analysis of a typical field case study in West Africa. Numerical model was adopted for the field case. Based on the field report, Flow Loop X 1 consisted of well X 1 and well X 2, (where X 1 is the well at the inlet and X 2 is the well connected from the manifold (MF)). Slugging was experienced at Flow Loop X 1 at 3000 BoPD; 4 MMScf/D and 3 %W/C. This study investigated the conditions causing the slugging and the liquid and gas phase behaviour at the period slugging occurred. The simulation work involved modelling the boundary conditions (heat transfer, ambient temperature, mass flowrate e. t. c). Also critical was the modelling of the piping diameter, pipe length, wall thickness and wall type material to reflect the field geometry. Work on flow regime transition chart showed that slugging became more significant from 30 % water-cut, especially at the riser base for a downward inclined flow on the pipeline- riser system. Studies on diameter effect showed that increasing diameter from 8 ” – 32 ” gave rise to a drop in Usg (superficial velocity gas) and possible accumulation of liquids on the riser- base position and hence a tendency for slugging formation. Depth effect study showed that increasing depth gave rise to increasing pressure fluctuation, especially at the riser- base. Studies on the Self-Lift slug mitigation approach showed that reducing the internal diameter of the Self-lift by-pass pipe was effective in mitigating <b>slug</b> flow. <b>S</b> 3 (<b>Slug</b> suppression system) was also investigated for deepwater scenario, with the results indicating a production benefit of 12. 5 %. In summary, the work done identified water-cut region where pipeline-riser systems become more susceptible to slugging. Also, two key up-coming slug mitigation strategies were studied and their performance evaluated in-view of production enhancement...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a new {{flow regime}} {{transition}} model is proposed for two-phase flows in a vertical annulus. Following previous works, the flow regimes considered are bubbly (B), <b>slug</b> (<b>S)</b> or cap-slug (CS), churn (C) and annular (A). The B to CS transition is modeled using the maximum bubble package criteria of small bubbles. The S to C transition takes place for small annulus perimeter flow channels {{and it is}} assumed to occur when the mean void fraction over the entire region exceeds that over the slug–bubble section. If the annulus perimeter is larger that the distorted bubble limit the cap-slug flow regime will be considered since in these conditions {{it is not possible}} to distinguish between cap and partial-slug bubbles. The CS to C transition is modeled using the maximum bubble package criteria. However, this transition considers the coalescence of cap and spherical bubbles in order to take into account the flow channel geometry. Finally, the C to A transition is modeled assuming two different mechanisms, (a) flow reversal in the liquid film section along large bubbles; (b) destruction on liquid slugs or large waves by entrainment or deformation. In the S to C and C to A flow regime transitions the annulus flow channel is considered as a rectangular flow channel with no side walls. In all the modeled transitions the drift-flux model is used to obtain the final correlations. The final equations for every flow regime transition are easy to be implemented in computational codes and not experimental input is needed. The prediction accuracy of the newly developed model has been checked against air–water as well as boiling flow regime maps. In all the cases, the new developed model shows better predicting capabilities than the existing correlations most used in literature...|$|R
40|$|Liquid and gas phases {{circulate}} horizontally {{through the}} same channel in many industrial processes. They can do it following different patterns of so-called two-phase flow. Depending on the superficial velocity of {{each one of the}} phases, the flow can vary. The different types of flows observed in horizontal pipes are bubbly flow, stratified flow,wavy flow, slug flowand annular flow. The first formal classification of flow patterns was carried out by Taitel and Dukler during the 1970 <b>s</b> [TNA 78]. <b>Slug</b> flow is a phenomenon that has gained importance during the last decades in different technology fields. The two best-known areas where its analysis is of great importance are nuclear power plants and oil and gas extraction and distribution. In nuclear power plants that operate with boiling water (mainly PWR and BWR), vapor and liquid water circulate chaotically mixed till they arrive to an elbow or a U-tube where centrifugal forces lead to the separation of gas and liquid. From there, if the superficial velocities of the two phases belong to slug flow, whose water hammers could damage or eventually break the pipe, an undesired effect called LOCA (Loss Of Coolant Accident) could take place. Regarding oil and gas extraction and distribution, {{it is important to consider}} that from natural oilfields any extraction of hydrocarbons will consist on a mixture of components with different volatility; therefore, it will usually consist on liquids and gases flowing together, sometimes in slug flow and consequently provoking pressure peaks throughout the pipelines, which means lower pumping efficiency and potential damage for the distribution materials. The study of slug onset is especially interesting because if it were avoided or controlled by artificial means, all the dangers described in the paragraph above would automatically disappear. Rafi Ahmed and Sanjoy Banerjee developed a theoretical method to predict the onset of slugs based on instabilities in the amplitude of waves in 1985, the so-called Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities [AB 85]. This slug onset mechanism was accepted by most authors, but its wavelength dependence contradicted the experimental data. Therefore, a theoretical model using the concept of energy balance and taking into account the shear stresses was developed by Chun and Lee in 1996 [CL 96]. Hurlburt and Hanratty investigated the transition from slug to plug flow, which differs from slug in its lack of air within the liquid body, using slug stability in 2001 [HH 02] and so helping to define the boundary conditions of slug flow. Regarding measurement techniques for the analysis of slugs, 2 D PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) started being used in the late 1970 s and is the most common technique nowadays since it allows highlighting the right number of particles for the study of the flow dynamics. It consists on the introduction in the fluid of tracer particles that can be identified due to their luminescence when a laser plane intersects the flow. In addition, a recording system consisting of one or more cameras with a high shooting frequency provides accurate sequences of pictures that can be processed by suitable software to determine velocity fields based on the path followed by the tracer particles. Another technique based on the same principle and used in the investigations of flow dynamics is Stereo PIV. In this case, two cameras are needed and the target of the laser is a plane perpendicular set to the axis of the tube. Although in this way more information about the secondary flows can be determined, this method requires a very accurate and difficult calibration of the recording system and at least two cameras with a perfect synchronization in time. Besides, the processing of the images obtained with Stereo PIV needs to be treated and correlated through a more time-demanding process than 2 D PIV. Though Stereo PIV has been used in the analysis of pipe flow since 2003 with the work of Van Doornel [vDHLÅ 03], it has been applied for the first time in the Chair of Thermodynamics of the Technische Universität München for the investigation of two-phase flow [CUS 11]. The scope of this work is the further investigation of slug onset and its description including secondary effects such as turbulences, a characteristic that has never been illustrated about slug flow. For this purpose, images obtained with 2 D PIV and Stereo PIV will be used. To enhance the quality of the results, the first task will be the development of suitable software to avoid false velocity vectors produced by reflection and refraction, to overlap several pairs of images obtained by different cameras simultaneously and to treat the data gained after PIV computerized analysis. Moreover, a new kind of graphical representations that reveal a deep insight in the velocity fields of slug flow will be shown...|$|R
