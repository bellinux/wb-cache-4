500|$|Musically, [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] is {{credited}} as a ballad {{compared to the}} rest of the dance-fuelled tracks from The Fame. It is a 1980s-influenced synthpop and bubblegum pop song, while incorporating the [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] hook from Rihanna's single [...] "Umbrella", according to Freedom du Lac from The Washington Post. Gaga stated that the lyrics of [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] are about love and she explained that [...] "'Eh, Eh' is my simple pop song about finding <b>someone</b> <b>new</b> and breaking up with the old boyfriend." [...] Writer James E. Perone mentioned in his book The Album: A Guide to Pop Music's Most Provocative, Influential, and Important Creations that with the lyrics, Gaga maintained a focus on transitory relationships. Although the lyrics explained her former lover that she had found <b>someone</b> <b>new</b> and did not mean to hurt him with the news, the continuous repetition of the phrase [...] "nothing else I can say" [...] solidifies the transient nature of the relationship portrayed. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 94 beats per minute. Gaga's vocal range spans from B3 to C5 with the main key in which the song is set being E major. The song follows in the chord progression of E–B–Fm–E–B–Fm. Synthpop musician Frankmusik remixed the track for Gaga's 2010 album, The Remix, where he manipulated Gaga's vocals and created a dreamy quality with them, as noted by Nicki Escuedo from Phoenix New Times.|$|E

500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met <b>someone</b> <b>new.</b> That inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric. I was saying ... that I may not really be a virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E

[...] "One Last Time" [...] is written in the key of A-flat major, with a moderately fast tempo of 125 beats per minute. Grande's vocals range from F#3 to C6.

500|$|Goebbels' {{tactic of}} using {{provocation}} to {{bring attention to}} the NSDAP, along with violence at the public party meetings and demonstrations, led the Berlin police to ban the NSDAP from the city on 5 May 1927. Violent incidents continued, including young Nazis randomly attacking Jews in the streets. Goebbels was subjected to a public speaking ban {{until the end of}} October. During this period, he founded the newspaper Der Angriff (The Attack) as a propaganda vehicle for the Berlin area. It was a modern-style newspaper with an aggressive tone. To Goebbels' disappointment, circulation was initially small, only 2,000. Material in the paper was highly anti-communist and antisemitic. Among the paper's favourite targets was the Jewish Deputy Chief of the Berlin Police Bernhard Weiß. Goebbels gave him the derogatory nickname [...] "Isidore" [...] and subjected him to a relentless campaign of Jew-baiting in the hope of provoking a crackdown he could then exploit. Goebbels continued to try to break into the literary world, with a revised version of his book Michael finally being published, and the unsuccessful production of two of his plays (Der Wanderer and Die Saat (The Seed)). The latter was his final attempt at playwriting. During this period in Berlin he had relationships with many women, including his old flame Anka Stalherm, who was now married and had a small child. He was quick to fall in love, but easily tired of a relationship and moved on to <b>someone</b> <b>new.</b> He worried too about how a committed personal relationship might interfere with his career.|$|E

As a joke, Rob Lowe's credit during the opening credits reads [...] "and introducing Rob Lowe". Unlike Scott, Lowe was originally not expected to join the regular cast, but rather make guest appearances in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] and six third season episodes before departing the show. However, after those episodes were filmed, Lowe later joined the show as a regular cast member. Lowe said he loved playing the part, which he described as [...] "a big fat nerd" [...] and [...] "the most positive person in the world [...] unrelenting enthusiasm", adding, [...] "He is also very, very intense and specific. So whether he's ordering how he would like his water or describing the kind of colors he wants on a graph, everything means the world to him." [...] Throughout the episode, whenever he meets <b>someone</b> <b>new,</b> Chris Traeger points directly at their face and slowly repeats their name. Schur said this habit was the first element the writers conceived for the character. In one line of the episode, while describing his exercise regimen and supplements, [...] "Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born. I believe I am that human being." [...] That line was inspired by Schur's wife, J. J. Philbin, who had recently read an article about that scientific prediction and felt it applied to the character. Parks and Recreation was suffering in the Nielsen ratings when [...] "The Master Plan" [...] aired, and it was hoped Lowe's appearance would help increase viewership.

The group, along with Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Cilla Black, Harrison's sister-in-law Jenny Boyd, and around 300 others, learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation, and were given their mantras. The group [...] "hesitated only slightly" [...] when asked to donate the customary week's wages, a large sum for a Beatle, to learn. While there, they announced at a press conference that they were giving up drugs (apparently referring to psychedelics, but not marijuana).
