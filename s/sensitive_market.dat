For {{the best part of}} the {{afternoon}} he searched one likely haunt after another, spurred on by the sensational posters which the evening papers were displaying broadcast over the West End. [...] "General Baden-Baden mobilizes Boy-Scouts. Another COUP D'ÉTAT feared. Is Windsor Castle safe?" [...] This was one of the earlier posters, and was followed by one of even more sinister purport: [...] "Will the Test-match have to be postponed?" [...] It was this disquietening question which brought home the real seriousness of the situation to the London public, and made people wonder whether one might not pay too high a price for the advantages of party government. Belturbet, questing round in the hope of finding the originator of the trouble, with a vague idea of being able to induce him to restore matters to their normal human footing, came across an elderly club acquaintance who dabbled extensively in some of the more <b>sensitive</b> <b>market</b> securities. He was pale with indignation, and his pallor deepened as a breathless newsboy dashed past with a poster inscribed: [...] "Premier's constituency harried by moss-troopers.

He had done so with an entire indifference to the commercial possibilities of the case, because he had been irritated by the enormous publicity given to Behrens' assertion that he had achieved this long-sought end. Of course the production of artificial rubbers and rubber-like substances {{had been one of the}} activities of the synthetic chemist for many years, from the appearance of Tilden's isoprene rubber onward, and there was already a formidable list of collaterals, dimethybutadiene, and so forth, by which the coveted goal could be approached. Behrens had boldly added to this list as his own a number of variations upon a theme of Trafford's, originally designed to settle certain curiosities about elasticity. Behrens' products were not only more massively rubber-like than anything that had gone before them, but also extremely cheap to produce, and his bold announcement of success had produced a check in rubber sales and widespread depression in the quiveringly <b>sensitive</b> <b>market</b> of plantation shares. Solomonson had consulted Trafford about this matter at Vevey, and had heard with infinite astonishment that Trafford had already roughly prepared and was proposing to complete and publish, unpatented and absolutely unprotected, first a smashing demonstration of the unsoundness of Behrens' claim and then a lucid exposition of just what had to be done and what could be done to make an indiarubber absolutely indistinguishable from the natural product. The business man could not believe his ears.|$|E

40|$|It is my {{pleasure}} and honour {{to address this}} distinguished gathering of top bankers. My remarks this morning are on the regulatory framework for the exchange and use of credit information; this is a subject which is of great relevance for both {{the development of the}} financial sector and customer protection. The interests of both the financial institutions and their customers must be properly balanced. The nature of financial transactions means that financial <b>markets</b> are information <b>sensitive</b> <b>markets.</b> Market imperfections in financial markets mostly emanate from some sort of informational problem. In extreme cases, lack of adequate information causes markets to fail completely; a phenomenon which has been analysed extensively by economists such as Josepth Stiglitz and George Akerlof, who were awarded Nobel prizes for their work. Access to credit information on prospective borrowers enables lenders to better evaluate the creditworthiness of the borrowers. This reduces the information costs of lending and hence should allow more credit to be made available at lower interest rates. Better credit information can reduce the extent of credit rationing which is a serious problem in financial markets...|$|R

Marriott International had {{many of the same}} issues that airlines did: perishable inventory, customers booking in advance, lower cost competition and wide swings with regard to balancing supply and demand. Since [...] "yield" [...] was an airline term and did not necessarily pertain to hotels, Marriott International and others began calling the practice Revenue Management. The company created a Revenue Management organization and invested in automated Revenue Management systems that would provide daily forecasts of demand and make inventory recommendations for each of its 160,000 rooms at its Marriott, Courtyard Marriott and Residence Inn brands. They also created [...] "fenced rate" [...] logic similar to airlines, which would allow them to offer targeted discounts to price <b>sensitive</b> <b>market</b> segments based on demand. To address the additional complexity created by variable lengths-of-stay, Marriott's Demand Forecast System (DFS) was built to forecast guest booking patterns and optimize room availability by price and length of stay. By the mid-1990s, Marriott's successful execution of revenue management was adding between $150 million and $200 million in annual revenue.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that corporations are capitalising on a <b>sensitive</b> <b>market</b> when advertising to children. The average child {{is exposed to}} approximately 40,000 commercials a year. These messages are channelled through television, the internet, bill board campaigns and print media. Toy marketers are also known for more direct approaches, targeting schools. Doing so by producing toys that are advertised with ‘educational benefits’ throughout primary school catalogues and news letters. A study on child advertising during Dec 2007 {{examined the relationship between}} television commercials and children’s requests to Father Christmas. Throughout the findings there was a significant correlation between the items requested and the commercials viewed. Proportionally there was a greater number of brands requested when associated with higher television viewing time. [...] These findings reflect the impact marketers have on children. Through the use of advertising, brands are shaping the opinions and beliefs of young children every day thus generating an unrelenting appetite for branded merchandise. The intentions of toy manufactures are to influence children while they are young to gain brand loyalty, devolving premature consumers. The consumers of the future. Marketing strategies towards child advertising are paid high attention to as the market is generating approximately 21 billion dollars into the United States economy each year. This is possible due to the influential amount of purchasing power children have when pressuring their parents, through what marketers refer to as ‘pester power’.|$|E
5000|$|In 1953 the Lloyd LP400 (saloon/sedan) {{came with}} a manufacturer's {{recommended}} price of DM 3,780, while the Kombi was priced at DM 3,970. By September 1955, supported by that year's healthy sales volumes, and presumably in response to pressure from the market, {{the price of the}} LP400 was down to DM3,350, and the Kombi was offered at DM 3,480. However, the West German small car market in West Germany was increasingly dominated by Volkswagen. In March 1954 the price of a standard Volkswagen was reduced from DM 4,150 to DM 3,950. Apart from a handful of exotic looking (and exotically priced) vehicles, the passenger cars produced by Volkswagen were all the same shape. The shape had been innovative twenty years earlier, but the architecture and look of the car had changed very little since. The approach of the Borgward Group could hardly have been more different. In 1955 the group produced 91,810 passenger cars, using three different brands and offering a wider range of models than any other West German manufacturer, with models replaced or substantially upgraded every few years. One result of these contrasting approaches was that it was Volkswagen that set the prices in what was still an acutely price <b>sensitive</b> <b>market</b> segment. In August 1955 the price of a standard Volkswagen came down again, to DM 3,790, a level that it held till 1961.
