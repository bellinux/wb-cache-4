As Craven explains, they wanted someone who would take these characters {{in a direction that}} most actors would not—they wanted originality. Craven states, [...] "You need an actor who can bring a complete <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> that character without making it silly and not be afraid to go in there to the point where someone might say, 'Oh, you got bad in you?' You have to be brave enough and mature enough to know we've all got it, and you're not afraid of putting it out there and if you've got a problem with seeing that, tough." [...] For instance, Iliadis wanted to avoid casting some superficially sexy actress in the role of Mari, because he did not want the rape sequence to appear enjoyable to the viewers in any possible way. Iliadis notes that when Sara Paxton came in her audition was [...] "good", but it was this sense of intelligence and intensity that Paxton brought with her. The actress also had the [...] "innocent face" [...] the director was looking for, someone who had this [...] "wholesomely American look" [...] that would not allow anyone to enjoy watching her go through these intense events.|$|E

One such indication is the increasing emphasis on improved measures of saving, providing a better link between actions in the present and their implications for the future. ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{recent study}} found that {{individuals}} who participate in shared decision-making are more likely to feel secure and may feel a stronger <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> recover. Also, research has shown that SDM leads to higher judgments of the quality of care. Furthermore, SDM leads to greater self-efficacy in patients, which in turn, leads to better health outcomes. When a patient participates more in the decision-making process, the frequency of self-management behaviors increases, as well. [...] Self-management behaviors fall into three broad categories: health behaviors (like exercise); consumeristic behaviors (like reading the risks about a new treatment); and disease-specific management strategies. In a similar vein, a {{recent study found}} that among patients with diabetes, the more an individual remembers information given by a physician, the more the patient participated in self-care behaviors at home.|$|E

And so, that’s why—you know, having been here only for two days, I’ve had a chance to meet people from every level of society, decision makers as well as citizens, and there’s a sense that things matter in these kind of discussions, which are direct, relatively low-key, nonconfrontational, matter-of-fact.

50|$|Regulatory focus theory, {{according}} to Higgins, views motivation {{in a way}} that allows an understanding of the foundational ways we approach a task or a goal. Different factors can motivate people during goal pursuit, and we self-regulate our methods and processes during our goal pursuit. RFT proposes that motivational strength is enhanced when the manner in which people work toward a goal sustains their regulatory orientation. Achieving a goal {{in a way that}} is consistent to a person's regulatory orientation leads to an individual sense of importance to the event. The impact of motivation is considered calculated and this creates a greater <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the goal. The more strongly an individual is engaged (i.e., involved, occupied, fully engrossed) in an activity, the more intense the motivational force experienced. Engagement is of great importance to attain and motivate in order to reach a goal. Engagement serves as intensifier of the directional component of the value experience. An individual who is strongly engaged in a goal pursuits will experience a positive target more positively and a negative target more negatively.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{no known}} {{national}} {{leader of the}} Bloods but individual Bloods sets have a hierarchical leadership structure with identifiable levels of membership. These levels of membership indicate status within a gang. A leader, typically an older member with a more extensive criminal background, runs each set.

The majority of set members are called [...] "soldiers", who are typically {{between the ages of}} 16 and 22.

[...] "Associates" [...] are not full members, but they identify with the gang and take part in various criminal activities.

50|$|Dunbar {{argues that}} when {{the size of a}} social group increases, the number of {{different}} relationships in the group may increase by orders of magnitude. Chimpanzees live in groups of about 50 individuals whereas humans typically have a social circle of about 150 people, which is also the typical size of social communities in small societies and personal social networks; this number is now referred to as Dunbar's number. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that the success of groups is dependent on their size at foundation, with groupings of around 150 being particularly successful, potentially reflecting the fact that communities of this size strike a balance between the minimum size of effective functionality and the maximum size for creating a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the community. According to the social brain hypothesis, when hominids started living in large groups, selection favored greater intelligence. As evidence, Dunbar cites a relationship between neocortex size and group size of various mammals. However, meerkats have far more social relationships than their small brain capacity would suggest. Another hypothesis is that it is actually intelligence that causes social relationships to become more complex, because intelligent individuals are more difficult to learn to know.|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} about social {{cohesion}} {{in rural communities}} and how this interacts with Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Social cohesion is considered {{in terms of both}} system integration and social integration. System integration includes business and cultural organisations, civil society and communal spaces on and offline, which can provide bridging mechanisms to bring together disparate social groups. Social integration refers to more informal mechanisms of inclusion, including social networks, a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging, <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the common good. The paper considers these elements of social cohesion in relation to the intertwining of on and offline relationships by examining two contrasting rural communities in Northern Scotland. The paper concludes that ICT can play very different roles in social cohesion for different social and cultural groups as well as for different kinds of locational communities, but that ICT is becoming an integral part of rural social relations...|$|R
