40|$|Metazoan gill parasites of 30 {{albacore}} Thunnus alalunga {{caught in}} the Balearic Sea (western Mediterranean) were examined for parasites with the aim to evaluate their possible use as biological tags. A total of 9 species of parasites were found: 1 capsalid monogenean, 6 didymozoid trematodes and 2 crustaceans. Most of the parasites collected were didymozoids (95. 8 % of all specimens) and Didymozoon longicolle was the dominant <b>species.</b> <b>Albacore</b> is a new host record for Capsala paucispinosa and Didymozoon pretiosus, while Didymosulcus aahi, Didymosulcus dimidiatus, Nematobothrium latum and Rocinela sp. are {{for the first time}} reported from the Mediterranean Sea. Significant differences were found grouping data by host size, with lower infection levels in the larger sized fish, whereas no differences were found between host sex. Most of the parasites showed a high site selection: D. aahi, D. dimidiatus and D. longicolle had significant differences of prevalence between internal and external margins of gill filaments, and almost all specimens of Pseudocycnus appendiculatus were attached to the gill filaments of the second and third holobranchs. The usefulness of parasites as biological tags is discussed; particularly, D. longicolle and D. pretiosus could be used to separate Mediterranean and northeast Atlantic stocks of albacore...|$|E

40|$|Edible {{marine species}} (fish, {{cephalopod}} molluscs, crustaceans) from the Adriatic Sea were analyzed for content in heavy metals (Hg, Cd and Pb) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Health risks to human via dietary intake of seafood were {{assessed by the}} target hazard quotients (THQs) and the toxic equivalent factors (TEFs). Mercury maximum concentrations corresponded to fish (0. 07 - 1. 56 microg g(- 1) w. w.), followed by cephalopod molluscs (0. 10 - 0. 55 microg g(- 1) w. w.), and crustaceans (0. 27 - 0. 33 microg g(- 1) w. w.). Cadmium levels in cephalopods (0. 18 - 0. 59 microg g(- 1) w. w.) were higher than those in fish (0. 01 - 0. 05 microg g(- 1) w. w.) and crustaceans (0. 02 - 0. 04 microg g(- 1) w. w.), while for Pb the concentrations were generally low (fish: ND- 1. 18 microg g(- 1) w. w., cephalopods: ND- 0. 17 microg g(- 1) w. w., crustaceans: ND- 0. 03 microg g(- 1) w. w.).

40|$|The {{extent to}} which Pacific Island {{fisheries}} affect marine mammals, sea turtles, and seabirds due to bycatch remains largely unknown. This report attempts to synthesize the existing information relating to fisheries and bycatch of marine mammals, sea turtles, and sea birds in the Pacific Island countries and territories. The Oceania region encompasses the 22 Pacific Island countries and territories including Papua New Guinea (PNG), but excluding Hawaii, New Zealand, and Australia. Tuna {{is the most important}} commercial fishery with four target <b>species</b> (<b>albacore,</b> bigeye, skipjack, and yellowfin) and four distinct gear types (purse seine, longline, pole and line, and trollers) (Gillett, 2008). The subsistence and artisanal fisheries located inshore are largely unregulated with little to no monitoring of catch or effort. Bycatch would be extremely difficult to monitor in these fisheries as seabirds, turtles and even some marine mammals are consumed traditionally throughout the Pacific Islands and any unintentional catch would be retained and consumed. 	 Despite efforts in certain areas and on several species, e. g., humpback whales, detailed knowledge of marine mammals, seabirds and sea turtles is at best extremely limited. The only bycatch mortality estimates are from the commercial tuna fishery indicating around 265 marine mammals, 100 seabirds and 900 sea turtles are killed per year (Molony 2005). The main challenge to identifying and quantifying bycatch of sea turtles is the lack of observer coverage. 	 Information on population structure and occurrence of marine mammals, sea turtles, and seabirds in the region should be a priority. Bycatch language should be written into national tuna management programs and industry should be involved in discussions to mitigate bycatch at the WCPFC. Other recommendations include research into the catch and effort in subsistence and small-scale fisheries as well as mandatory workshops for commercial vessel owners on bycatch handling and training as part of a licensing scheme...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} carried out to explore how to create an export {{opportunity}} for Tonga {{that would have a}} measure of geographical exclusivity. The product is a model cured fermented tuna sausage that could be produced in Tonga from the commercial <b>species</b> <b>albacore</b> tuna (Thunnus alalunga). The motive for this model is that certain features of Tonga, namely a hot climate, expensive electricity for alternative tuna preservation methods and long shipping times to foreign markets, can be turned from a disadvantage to an advantage. The fish meat sausage was, salted, nitrite cured and bacillus-fermented at 32 °C with a Tongan carbohydrate source, taro to create a product stable that requires little or no refrigeration. The research {{was carried out}} in two phases. The first was to determine the effect of microwave cooking on the fermentable sugar formation in tubers (taro, potato, kumara), and having defined a useful hydrolysed source, the second phase was sausage production to define its physiochemical properties. Of the three potential cooked carbohydrate sources, kumara showed the highest glucose concentration followed by taro and then potato after hydrolysis. Taro, which is particularly important to Tonga as a staple food, generated potentially useful concentrations of glucose and was chosen for further work. The concentrations of taro used in this study were 0, 10, 20 and 30 %, a likely range of concentrations to fulfill one criteria; a fermented tuna product but produced at minimal cost. Tuna is much more expensive than taro. 	After four days of fermentation at 32 ºC, the pH of each treatment was between 4. 1 and 3. 9, very low by fermented meat standards. Hardness and springiness increased on Day 4 while cohesiveness and adhesiveness decreased. The product was increasingly hard, sticky and brittle, probably due to staling, more formally called retrogradation of taro starch. The colour changes showed an increase in L* (light reflectance) while the a* (redness) values decreased in relative to b* (yellowness) values confirming that a brown fermented fish mince (FFM) sausage was produced. 	Proteolysis in sausage containing 20 % taro, measured colorimetrically by soluble peptide bonds, was greatest for uncured FFM (P < 0. 001) sausage compared to cured FFM sausage. Lipid oxidation measured by thiobarbituric acid method was unvarying with curing and with time providing there is no important difference between curing and uncuring. Histamine being the sole biogenic amine decreased in concentration with a statistically significant but unimportant difference between cured and uncured FFM sausage. These values were lower than the maximum allowable limit of 200 ppm in New Zealand as well as those reported for fermented fish sausage in Southeast Asia. The results point to commercial opportunities and further research in which sensory analysis should be performed before the products can be tested in the market...|$|E
50|$|Fatty {{predatory fish}} like sharks, swordfish, tilefish, and {{albacore}} tuna may be high in omega-3 fatty acids, {{but due to}} their position {{at the top of}} the food chain, these species may also accumulate toxic substances through biomagnification. For this reason, the United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends limiting consumption (especially for women of childbearing age) of certain (predatory) fish <b>species</b> (e.g. <b>albacore</b> tuna, shark, king mackerel, tilefish and swordfish) due to high levels of the toxic contaminant mercury.

40|$|Our {{study focused}} {{on the status of}} the marine {{recreational}} fishery along the northern and central California coast, where surveys of recreational fishing effort and catch were conducted from 1958 – 61 and from 1981 – 86. Between the two surveys, annual recreational fishing effort rose from 1. 6 million fishing days to 2. 7 million fishing days. Nearly all the increase was due to increases in fishing from boats (commercial passenger fishing vessels and private/rental boats). Annual recreational catch rose from 3. 9 million fish weighing 2700 metric tons to 6. 5 million fish weighing 5400 metric tons. The average number of fish caught per day decreased for fishing from piers (1. 9 to 1. 6), other shore areas (1. 7 to 1. 1), and private/rental boats (2. 8 to 2. 4), and increased from commercial passenger fishing vessels (5. 4 to 6. 0). The variety of different fish species caught in a typical day of fishing from boats decreased, but variety from shore increased. Direct expenditures in the fishery from 1981 – 86 were about $ 160 million per year (1992 dollars). Rockfish (Sebastes spp.) dominated the catch from boats in both surveys. Between the two surveys, recreational catch of rockfish rose from 1. 3 million fish to 3. 4 million fish, while average weight per rockfish decreased from 0. 82 kg to 0. 71 kg. Average weight decreased in 12 of 16 major rockfish species. The 12 species were mainly shallow-water (m) species or species with wide depth ranges. The catch from boats shifted towards a higher proportion of deep-water (> 73 m) species. Signs of population stress were found in blue rockfish S. mystinus (decrease in catch), canary rockfish S. pinniger and yellowtail rockfish S. flavidus (decrease in mean length in recreational and trawl catches and high incidence of sexually immature fish in recreational catch), and brown rockfish S. auriculatus (decrease in mean length and high incidence of sexually immature fish in recreational catch). Abrupt declines in lengths of blue rockfish and yellowtail rockfish occurred in central California between 1983 and 1984. Declines reflect mortalities that may in part be attributed to effects of the 1982 – 83 El Niño event. Mean weight per rockfish decreased in a north-to-south cline from Del Norte/Humboldt (1. 13 kg) to San Luis Obispo (0. 48 kg) in 1980 – 86. The major species generally had smaller fish and fewer successful year-classes in central California than northern California. Catches of lingcod Ophiodon elongatus, a trophy species of importance to both boat and shore fishing, have been in slow oscillating decline since the early 1970 s. It is unclear whether the decline is due to overharvest and is a long-term trend that will continue, or if it is due to natural population fluctuations. Fishes of the surfperch family (Embiotocidae) dominated catch from shore in both surveys. of the fish groups we examined, the surfperch showed the greatest evidence of decline. Between the surveys, the weight of sport catch of surfperches declined by 54 % and the weight of commercial catch declined by 26 %. Barred surfperch Amphistichus argenteus and redtail surfperch A. rhodoterus (the two most important surfperches by number and weight landed), and also striped seaperch Embiotoca lateralis showed substantial decreases in recreational catch and average weight per fish. Commercial landings of redtail surfperch in the Eureka area declined by 54 % from 1953 through 1992, despite a rise in price per pound. Commercial landings of barred surfperch in the Santa Barbara area rose by 118 % from 1953 through 1992, perhaps due to a rise in price per pound. White seaperch Phanerodon furcatus stocks may have collapsed prior to the 1958 – 61 survey. Like rockfish, mean weight per surfperch decreased in a north-to-south cline from Del Norte/Humboldt (0. 33 kg) to San Luis Obispo (0. 22 kg) in 1980 – 86. Populations of lingcod and five of six rockfishes examined for interannual length-frequency trends were found to be subject to wide variation in recruitment from year to year. Strong year-classes often dominated a species' catch for several consecutive years. Strong year-classes were not found to be established in the 1957 – 58 and 1982 – 83 El Niño periods. Ten pelagic fish <b>species</b> (<b>albacore</b> Thunnus alalunga, bigeye tuna T. obesus, bluefin tuna T. thynnus, bullet mackerel Auxis rochei, Pacific mackerel Scomber japonicus, Pacific bonito Sarda chiliensis, skipjack Katsuwonus pelamis, yellowfin tuna T. albacares, dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus, and California barracuda Sphyraena argentea) showed obvious northward shifts in the sampled recreational catch during the 1982 – 83 El Niño event.

In the 2007 fishing year (FY), eight trips (422 operations and 1, 010, 017 hooks) were observed. The majority of the observations were conducted in the North Atlantic. The number of observed species and individuals was 59 and 12, 281, respectively. In the North Atlantic, blue shark was the most dominant followed by tuna <b>species</b> (mainly <b>albacore</b> and bluefin tuna). Except for blue shark, Atlantic, albacore was the most dominant species in the central North Atlantic, while bluefin tuna was the most dominant in eastern and western North Atlantic. In general, more species were observed in the southern area (off Florida and the tropical area) than in the northern area (off Ireland, central North Atlantic, Grand Bank). The survival rates (percentage of the species caught alive) of catches were usually high for sharks, moderate for tunas and relatively low for some billfish. The survival rates were relatively higher in northern areas and lower in southern areas. A regional difference in sex ratio was observed for many species.

Loggerheads Caretta caretta (Linnaeus, 1758) can be incidentally captured by surface longlines. A number of captured individuals die during the fishing operation, which we consider direct mortality due to fishing. We analysed the relative loggerhead by-catch and direct mortality associated with each type of boat and gear from April to December during the period 1999 - 2004 in the Spanish surface longline fleet that fishes in the western Mediterranean Sea, an important fishing area for this fleet. We used different indices to compute the catch per unit effort (CPUE) according {{to the number of}} hooks and to the number of fishing operations for each type of boat and gear. Both by-catch and direct mortality differed significantly according to the type of boat and gear. With respect to the number of hooks, boats longer than 12 m not using a roller and targeting bluefin tuna captured the highest number of loggerheads, whereas boats longer than 12 m with a roller that targeted swordfish caused the highest direct mortality. With respect to the number of fishing operations, boats longer than 12 m without a roller that targeted albacore captured the highest number of loggerheads; the highest direct mortality was caused by this type of boat and by boats longer than 12 m using a roller and targeting swordfish...|$|R

40|$|Abstract only. Conservation and {{management}} of North American West Coast fisheries encompass {{a broad array of}} issues including the economic, spatial, and temporal relations between the coastal pelagic species live bait fishery and the highly migratory species recreational fishery. For the better part the century, the live bait fishery has supplied live bait to the commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV) fleet and private recreational anglers. Live bait consists primarily of small coastal pelagic species such as sardine, anchovy, and squid. The use of live bait in the recreational targeting of high value HMS <b>species,</b> such as <b>albacore</b> tuna, yellowtail tuna, bluefin tuna, marlin, and dolphin fish and the established nature of the live bait fishery's infrastructure differentiate the Southern California saltwater recreational fishery from other fisheries.

Tuna larvae were collected by means of surface plankton tows with a bongo gear with a quadrangular mouth measuring 1 m diagonally. The otolith microstructure of 157 and 71 field-captured larvae of Mediterranean bluefin and albacore, respectively, were analyzed to estimate the daily growth pattern.

40|$|The Western and Central Pacific Ocean sustains {{the highest}} tuna {{production}} in the world. This province is also characterized by many islands and a complex bathymetry that induces specific current circulation patterns {{with the potential to}} create a high degree of interaction between coastal and oceanic ecosystems. Based on a large dataset of oceanic predator stomach contents, our study used generalized linear models to explore the coastal-oceanic system interaction by analyzing predator-prey relationship. We show that reef organisms are a frequent prey of oceanic predators. Predator <b>species</b> such as <b>albacore</b> (Thunnus alalunga) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) frequently consume reef prey with higher probability of consumption closer to land and {{in the western part of}} the Pacific Ocean. For surface-caught-predators consuming reef prey, this prey type represents about one third of the diet of predators smaller than 50 cm. The proportion decreases with increasing fish size. For predators caught at depth and consuming reef prey, the proportion varies with predator species but generally represents less than 10 %. The annual consumption of reef prey by the yellowfin tuna population was estimated at 0. 8 +/- 0. 40 CV million tonnes or 2. 17 x 10 (12) +/- 0. 40 CV individuals.

40|$|In this paper, we {{illustrate}} {{characteristics of}} food system of tuna {{by making a}} bird’s-eye view of tuna trade and global distribution. Tuna resources are primarily consumed as caned tuna or Sashimi (=raw fish). The fishing methods and species predetermine the food system of the caught fish. Among seven tuna species that FAO Fishstat identifies, Bluefin, Southern Bluefin and Bigeye tunas are solely consumed as Sashimi, and therefore mostly exported to Japan. These tuna species are not worth fishing commercial resources unless they are purchased by Japanese. If we view Japanese consumers as a unique buyer, the market structure is characterized as a monopsony. Moreover, if the tuna is frozen, the product will be rocked in the closed distribution channel where {{the temperature of the}} cold-chain is not a standard one, minus 20 degree, but rather an extreme cold, minus 60 degree: such storage does not exist anywhere else. Despite such monopsonistic structure, the export prices of these species are not low compared with other marine products. We will further examine market structure and degree of concentration of world sashimi market. Other two <b>species,</b> Yellowfin and <b>Albacore,</b> are consumed both as canned product and Sashimi. Export price of Sashimi tuna is more than twice as high as that for canned material. Nevertheless, the supply of tuna to canning sector has not been ended off nor had the resource been depleted yet as a result of competitive catch. It is expected that the difference of fishing / distribution costs, demanded size, and the risk-return composition influenced the behavior of world tuna fishers and allowed some diversity in fishing methods and distribution. In fact, some fishing enterprises in Taiwan and the Philippines supply to both Sashimi and canning markets. While in Japan, there is no such example. We will examine the rational and sustainability of such co-existence of different distribution channels that share the same tuna resource. ...|$|R

A total of 286 larvae were analyzed for this study, of which 72 larvae corresponded to bluefin, 57 to albacore, 81 to bullet tuna and 76 to little tunny. Tuna larvae were separated into the pre-flexion and post-flexion developmental stages. Within the size 3 – 9 mm standard length (SL), the stable isotope of nitrogen (δ 15 N) showed {{significant differences between}} species where bluefin tuna larvae ranked highest. Pre-flexion bluefin tuna and little tunny larvae showed significantly higher δ 15 N signatures than the post-flexion larvae. This effect is attributed to a biochemical trace of maternal δ 15 N signatures. However, neither albacore nor bullet tuna larvae showed this pattern in δ 15 N signatures, possibly owing to a compensation effect between lower maternal δ 15 N values transmitted to pre-flexion larvae and the early increase of δ 15 N values in post-flexion stages. One way ANOVA showed significant differences between species in the stable isotope ratio of carbon (δ 13 C) values, which suggests specific differences of carbon sources. Furthermore, a similar significant ontogenic effect between δ 13 C signatures of pre-flexion and post-flexion larvae is also evidenced in all four species. At pre-flexion stages, all species except bullet tuna larvae showed significant negative relationships between δ 15 N and larval standard length. At post-flexion stages, a significant linear relationship with larval size was only observed in albacore and bullet tuna larvae indicating a possible trophic shift towards early piscivory. With respect to δ 13 C values with larval size, all four species showed significant linear decreases. It {{may be explained by}} the metabolism of growth of somatic mass subject to modification of the relative carbon isotopic sources. In conclusion, the species' signatures of δ 15 N and δ 13 C indicate differentiated early life trophic niches.
