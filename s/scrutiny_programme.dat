This led to the Financial Management Initiative, launched in September 1982 (Efficiency and Effectiveness in the Civil Service (Cmnd 8616)) as an umbrella for the efficiency <b>scrutiny</b> <b>programme</b> and with a wider focus on corporate planning, efficiency and objective-setting. Progress initially was sluggish, but in due course MINIS-style business planning became standard, and delegated budgets were introduced, so that individual managers were held much more accountable for meeting objectives, {{and for the first time}} for the resources they used to do so. Performance-related pay began in December 1984, was built on thereafter, and continues to this day, though the sums involved have always been small compared to the private sector, and the effectiveness of PRP as a genuine motivator has often been questioned.|$|E

In {{the weeks}} {{following}} these raids the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) amended its existing <b>scrutiny</b> <b>programme</b> of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) for 2006 / 7 {{to include the}} media and communications strategy of the MPS. 1. 2. The stated objectives of this amendment to the MPA’s <b>scrutiny</b> <b>programme</b> is to: a) Assess {{the extent to which}} the MPS has the strategies, policies, protocols and processes in place to ensure efficient and effective communication, media and reputation management, particularly in the context of the 24 hour news environment. b) Undertake a detailed analysis of the handling of the media and communication during the Forest Gate incident in June 2006. c) Assess how effectively the MPS engages internally to manage communication to the media, Londoners and stakeholders, particularly during sensitive operations. d) Understand the culture of the MPS towards communication and media management and the impact this has on the delivery of an effective service. e) Evaluate the use of resources available to the MPS to deliver this key function...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of underground experiments looking for phenomena beyond the standard model substantially rely on environmental background reduction. Therefore {{it is crucial to}} any of these experiments to conduct a precise material selection in order to ensure high radio-purity near the detector volume. In many cases, this can be achieved by low level gamma-spectroscopy. This thesis summarizes the efforts contributing to the development of an advanced shielding against gamma rays, muons and induced neutrons for a new germanium detector by the means of experiments and simulations. After collecting basic experience of the various background components by optimizing an existing muon veto, a first experimental setup is aimed at measuring the neutron attenuation power of both pure and boronated hydrocarbonic material. In addition neutron flux reduction was being investigated within a real detector environment by inserting layers of boronated polyethylene into a surrounding lead shield. Both experiments indicate a high efficiency in preventing the neutron background when adding a boronated moderator into the overall shield. Furthermore, a computer simulation was developed, addressing the problem of finding the best readout configuration for organic scintillators. The results will be used for the installation of the upcoming veto system of the future spectrometer. The final part of the thesis summarizes the results of radioactivity measurements taken of various samples, which were part of the regular <b>scrutiny</b> <b>programme...</b>|$|E

30|$|Quantile estimations {{which allow}} for decompositions support the {{decreasing}} {{relationship with the}} hourly wage reported earlier {{in the context of}} the intercept-shift model. In addition, this pattern generally holds for the unexplained component. These results suggest that the public-private pay gap is highest at low hourly wages. We noted earlier that it is highest for the less educated and, in some countries, for women. At one level, this picture suggests that the public sector is a vehicle for greater equality. But, at another level, this propensity is coming under closer <b>scrutiny,</b> particularly in <b>programme</b> countries which need to enhance their competitiveness, suggesting that social policy should be more targeted and separate from the remuneration practices of the public sector.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} Polish experiences in designing and implementing the National Roma Integration Strategy for the years 2004 - 2013 (hereinafter {{referred to as the}} “Programme”). Close <b>scrutiny</b> of the <b>Programme</b> is imperative as it constitutes one of the main pillars of Polish integration policies and forms a ‘prototype’ for the upcoming strategy for 2014 - 2020, which apart from small technical adjustments to the modus operandi has remained basically the same. The analysis is also timely as there is mounting evidence that many problems identified in the early 2000 s have not been fully resolved, and there is a danger that similar mistakes are being replicated. The article argues that the main shortcomings of the Programme are rooted in the down-playing of strategic dimensions of exclusion, and a failure to conceptualise integration of Roma as a process requiring changes in institutional settings and in the attitudes of both the majority and the minority population. The Programme’s narrow focus on the immediate needs of (often randomly selected) groups and communities, although effective in delivering practical and appreciated aid, has failed to recognise a need for wider pro-integration reforms and in many instances (perhaps unintentionally) only exacerbates divisions between the communities, thus undermining the legitimacy of public provisions...|$|R
40|$|Central {{government}} budgets will {{be highly}} constrained {{in the wake}} of stimulus spending and recession. Fiscal imperatives will increasingly drive the need to reconsider government policy fundamentals. There will be greater <b>scrutiny</b> of public <b>programmes,</b> including those addressing rural development, as decision makers weigh future options for action. Questions will be raised about the efficacy and efficiency of public programmes in meeting their goals, and the results of objective evaluation will be at a premium. Assessment is within the competency of many entities, but national audit agencies offer advantages in performing evaluations to support public deliberation and dialogue. The audit agency perspective is one that is independent from the branch of government that is responsible for programme execution. This independence is necessary but not sufficient for ensuring that evaluations are fair and balanced. An effective audit agency adheres strictly to professional standards of review and referencing and adopts procedures to guarantee that all facts and analyses are thoroughly checked for accuracy. Thus, an audit agency operates with a consistency in approach that may distinguish it from other potential performers of evaluation. This implies that audit agencies may have an increasingly important role to play in evaluating rural development programmes. Copyright No claim to original US government works.

40|$|In 2005, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Mongolia {{initiated}} {{the process of}} developing its Health Sector Strategic Master Plan (HSSMP), using a wide-ranging consultative process, driven by the MoH, and requiring participation from all levels of health facilities, other ministries, donor agencies and NGOs. Among other objectives, the MoH sought to coordinate the disparate inputs from key donors through the HSSMP, aligning them with the Plan 2 ̆ 7 s structure. This research explores {{the extent to which the}} HSSMP process served as a mechanism for effective aid coordination while promoting ownership and capacity building and the lessons learned for the wider international development community. The study is based on document review, key-informant interviews and authors 2 ̆ 7 experience and participation in the MoH planning processes. The HSSMP process improved alignment and harmonisation. It enabled a better local understanding of the benefits of aid coordination, and the recognition that aid coordination as not only a mere administrative task, but a strategic step towards comprehensive management of both domestic and external resources. The process was not challenge free; the fractious political environment, the frequent turnover of key MoH staff, the resistance of some donors towards MoH <b>scrutiny</b> over their <b>programmes</b> and the dismantling of the central coordination and return of seconded staff following completion of the HSSMP, has slowed the pace of reform. Despite the challenges, the approach resulted in positive outcomes in the areas of ownership and better aid coordination, with HSSMP development emphasising ownership and capacity building. This contrasted with the usual outcomes focus, and neglect of the capacity building learning processes and structural and policy changes needed to ensure sustainable change. The largest and most influential programmes in the health sector are now largely aligned with HSSMP strategies, enabling the MoH to utilize these opportunities to optimise the HSSMP outcomes. The lessons for Ministries of Health in similar Post-Soviet countries [...] or other emerging economies where government capacity and local policy processes are relatively strong [...] are clear: the development of solid governance and technical infrastructure in terms of planning and evaluation provide a solid structure for donor coordination and insure against local political change...|$|R
