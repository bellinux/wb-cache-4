50|$|<b>Self</b> <b>holding</b> tapers {{rely on a}} heavy {{preponderance}} of axial load over torsional load to transmit high torques. Problems may arise using large drills {{in relation to the}} shank, if the pilot hole is too large. The threaded style is essential for any sideloading, particularly milling. The only exception is that such unfavourable situations can be simulated to remove a jammed shank. Permitting chatter will help release the grip. The acute (narrow) taper angle can result in such jamming with heavy axial loads, or over long periods.|$|R
5000|$|The Morse taper {{allows the}} bit to be mounted {{directly}} into the spindle of a drill, lathe tailstock, or (with the use of adapters) into the spindle of milling machines. It is a self-locking (or <b>self</b> <b>holding)</b> taper of approximately 5/8" [...] per foot that allows the torque {{to be transferred to}} the drill bit by the friction between the taper shank and the socket. The tang {{at the end of the}} taper is only for ejecting the drill bit from the spindle, with the aid of a drift.|$|R
5000|$|NMTB is a [...] "self releasing" [...] or [...] "fast" [...] taper. Unlike {{the more}} acute <b>self</b> <b>holding</b> tapers above, such tapers are not {{designed}} to transmit high torque; high torques are carried by driving keys engaging slots on the flange. The purpose is to allow a quick and easy change between different tools (either automatically or by hand) while ensuring the tool or toolholder will be tightly and rigidly connected to the spindle, and accurately coaxial with it. The larger end adjacent to the tool makes for more rigidity than is possible with Morse or RT tapers fitted to comparable machines.|$|R

Prior to his diagnosis, he had been active in planning the Hampton Roads area Relay for Life and {{a supporter of the}} American Cancer Society. He served on the Chesapeake, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach Board of Directors and {{was a member of the}} National Advisory Committee for the Cancer Society’s main fund-raiser, the Relay for Life. Zahn produced a series of television news stories and a documentary program about his battle with cancer. The program, which aired on WVEC-TV, was entitled [...] "My Race Against Cancer." [...] The program chronicled his medical progress and personal ordeal from the time of his diagnosis until his cancer went into remission. At WVEC, Zahn produced two nationally distributed videos for the American Cancer Society encouraging communities to <b>hold</b> <b>Relay</b> for Life events. Zahn toured the United States to promote Relay for Life and continued his involvement with Relay until his death. He was inducted into National Relay Hall of Fame in 1999.|$|R

50|$|In the mid-1980s, Dr. Klatt {{expressed}} interest in helping raise funds for his local American Cancer Society. He decided he would raise money by doing something he enjoyed—running marathons. In May 1985, Dr. Klatt circled the track {{for a total of}} more than 83 miles at Baker Stadium at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma for 24 hours. Friends and family donated $25 to run or walk certain lengths with him. That year, he raised $27,000. While he ran, nearly 300 friends, family, and patients watched as he ran and walked the track.While he was running, Dr. Klatt began making plans on how the event could be even bigger in future years. Throughout the next year, he, along with an event committee, developed plans for the City of Destiny Classic 24-Hour Run Against Cancer.In 1986, 19 teams took part in the first team relay event and raised $33,000. Since then, Dr. Klatt’s idea has turned into more than 5,200 Relay For Life events across the United States that have raised nearly $5 billion. The American Cancer Society also licenses twenty non-governmental cancer organizations in other countries to <b>hold</b> <b>Relay</b> For Life events.|$|R

40|$|Chapter 1 : This chapter {{examines}} the logical {{consequences of the}} rather unsur-prising notion that humans care about and manage their self-image, a notion long taken for granted by psychologists. I model this by assuming that decisionmakers derive utility from positive views about the <b>self,</b> <b>holding</b> constant standard utilitarian outcomes usually assumed relevant in economics. Other than this, agents are time-consistent expected utility maximizers, are constrained in their updating by Bayes' rule, and can manipulate their beliefs only by controlling {{the flow of information}} that they receive. The motive to maintain a favorable self-image leads to a systematic re-jection of free information about the self in certain states of the world and eventually to overconfident beliefs. Economically relevant decisions are affected by this overcon-fidence as well as the incentive to gather information about and make decisions so as to optimally manage beliefs. Agents might avoid informative actions when satisfied with their current beliefs ('self-image protection'), and seek out activities in which they can prove themselves when they are not ('self-image enhancement'), even if thes...|$|R
40|$|Summary - The aim of {{the present}} study is to explore themes related to music therapy, {{children}} and young people and mental health. A qualitative, hermeneutic-phenomenological approach and semi-structured interviews with four music therapists, seeks to answer the research question What kind of position does self-esteem and sense of <b>self</b> <b>hold</b> in music therapy practice promoting childrens and young people´s mental health? The procedure chosen for the analysis is Interpretativ Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The results of the analysis shows that self-esteem and a sense of self can relate to music therapy, children and young people's mental helath in three main categories; Identity, Music therapy practice and Selfesteem/ sense of self, and seven ground categories: a place to feel free, mastery, social aspects, relationship, goals and working methods, change and coping. From a salutogenetic point of view, these categories have been discussed up against theories mostly from the field of music therapy and developmental psychology. - - Keywords: Self-esteem, sense of self, self-agency, mental health, children, adolescents, young people, music therapy, music...|$|R

50|$|Capacitance is {{the ability}} of a body to store an {{electric}} charge. There are two closely related notions of capacitance: self capacitance and mutual capacitance. Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance. A material with a large <b>self</b> capacitance <b>holds</b> more electric charge at a given voltage, than one with low capacitance. The notion of mutual capacitance is particularly important for understanding the operations of the capacitor, one of the three fundamental electronic components (along with resistors and inductors).|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{virtual reality}} systems that feed back to human senses {{have only been}} {{realized}} as visual and acoustic feedback. However, they are not enough to realize the force feedback system for hands, arms, legs and so on. The actuators required for such a system need to be flexible {{so as not to}} injure the body. The purpose of our study is to develop a flexible and lightweight actuator which can be safe enough to be attached to the human body. We propose new types of flexible pneumatic actuator that can be used even if the actuator is deformed by external force. In this study, we tested rodless type flexible pneumatic cylinders that have a <b>self</b> <b>holding</b> function for positioning under the condition of no supply pressure. We also developed a new type of McKibben artificial muscle that has a long stroke of more than 80 % of its original length. As a result of our experiment, we can confirm that the tested cylinder is useful to be applied in a positioning system because it consumes less air under the condition of holding. By using the tested Mckibben actuator, we can realize a long stroke lifting motion of a dumbbell whose mass is 6 kg...|$|R

40|$|Scholarship on Islam {{and gender}} {{consistently}} {{questions as to}} whether or not Islamic norms oppress Muslim women 2 ̆ 7 s agency. One aspect of this discussion is the issue of a Muslim woman 2 ̆ 7 s consent in getting married and in sexual relations. The scholarship of Kecia Ali focuses on this issue of consent, and when she finds the Islamic legal tradition lacking in allowing for a woman 2 ̆ 7 s consent in marriage, she calls for Muslim women to engage in acts of 2 ̆ 2 personal reflection. 2 ̆ 2 This creates a binary concerning agency, wherein external norms (The Islamic Legal tradition) suppress agency, while true agency is only found in acting in accordance with internally felt desires. This thesis investigates the reasons why Ali folds into ideas of personal reflection to reconcile Islamic understandings of marriage with contemporary Western views. In order to do this, I explore Ali 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to the Islamic Tradition 2 ̆ 7 s ability to change to incorporate consent in marriage, and how she fails to substantiate such flexibility and adaptability. Secondly, I argue that calling for 2 ̆ 2 personal reflection 2 ̆ 2 depends on notions of the authentic self, wherein the <b>self</b> <b>holds</b> inner depths and wisdom. In the second part of this thesis, I explore how the combined scholarship of Saba Mahmood and Ludwig Wittgenstein can provide enriched ways to understand agency. Through Mahmood 2 ̆ 7 s scholarship on the women 2 ̆ 7 s mosque movement in Egypt, she argues for a view of the self and desires as malleable through discipline. Building on this, Wittgenstein 2 ̆ 7 s theory of language games demonstrates how the discipline and outward action shape the rules of the language games, or rather, the norms of a society...|$|R
