5|$|Mells' war {{dead were}} first commemorated by a stone tablet {{on a wall}} in St Andrew's Church, {{designed}} by the Kensington School of Art and listing the names of 14 villagers. The idea for a larger, public memorial originated with the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> utilitarian function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for utilitarian memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should be something {{to be looked at}} and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial should be on the road in a prominent position where it would be obvious to passers-by.|$|E
500|$|I wanted <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Motown feel. Mel C {{eventually}} {{finished off}} the chorus {{and we had}} the basis for a song called [...] "Stop". Later, when we had more time, the other girls came in and we helped write the verses and bridges.|$|E
500|$|Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin said, {{about the}} writing of the song, [...] "That came out of playing live and wanting to have <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bit more bounce. We were really getting into things like PJ Harvey and Muse– things with a bit more energy." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Toronto Symphony's {{involvement}} was no coincidence. Conductor Peter Oundjian is Idle's first cousin. [...] "We've been talking {{for a long}} time," [...] said Idle, [...] "about wouldn't it be fun to do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> orchestra." ...|$|R
500|$|She {{returned}} to film {{with a more}} substantial role in the thriller Sorted (2000). Guillory went on {{to appear in the}} BBC production Take a Girl Like You, a television adaptation of Kingsley Amis's novel of the same name. She portrayed Jenny Bunn, the story's virginal heroine, and gained critical attention for her part in the period piece. Guillory was pleased to have played a more innocent character, saying [...] "I've played floozies, psychopaths, assassins, crackheads... It's nice to do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lighter touch." [...] The production did not fare well in the ratings.|$|E
500|$|Evancho {{appeared}} in the feature film The Company You Keep, a 2013 political thriller. She played Isabel, the eleven-year-old daughter of a widowed attorney turned fugitive, played by Robert Redford, who also directed the film. Jon Weisman wrote that Evancho [...] "showed she's more than a singing prodigy with her earnest sweetness". Redford cast Evancho only days before filming began. Evancho said in 2012: [...] "I don't think I want to act full-time. I think I might like to do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Disney special or make a movie {{once in a while}} that would give me enough time to sing and record, but that's about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Continuing the band's {{prominent}} use of strings– {{which began}} with the 1982 single [...] "The Back of Love"– they recorded Ocean Rain using a 35-piece orchestra. Lead guitarist Will Sergeant said, [...] "We wanted to make something conceptual with lush orchestration; not Mantovani, <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> twist. It's all pretty dark. 'Thorn of Crowns' {{is based on an}} eastern scale. The whole mood is very windswept: European pirates, a bit Ben Gunn; dark and stormy, battering rain; all of that." [...] During recording De Freitas used xylophones and glockenspiels in addition to his usual percussion, bass player Les Pattinson used an old reverb machine at des Dames and Sergeant's solo on [...] "My Kingdom" [...] was played using a Washburn acoustic guitar which he distorted through a valve radio.|$|E
5000|$|Now {{assume that}} going to/in the {{direction}} of takes the suffix [...] "-mo", doing <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> object or person takes the suffix [...] "-wot", and addressing someone by their name takes the suffix [...] "-hey".

50|$|Mellanby {{chose to}} use {{conscientious}} objectors {{because they were the}} only group of healthy young people who were not likely to be taken away from him for some military purpose {{in the middle of an}} experiment.

500|$|Series creator Joshua Safran {{initially}} {{wanted a}} [...] "straightforward action show" [...] {{different from his}} past work, which included the soapy dramas Gossip Girl and Smash. He revealed {{that he wanted to}} do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> law enforcement theme such as a political thriller about the NYPD after the September 11 attacks. He based protagonist Alex Parrish, whose complex family history haunts her throughout the series, on a relative; Safran wove his own struggle to understand that family member into Alex's desire to learn the truth about her father. Safran said [...] "I have a family member who either is a pathological liar or has been involved with a government agency my whole life. I've always struggled with knowing that I would never know the truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard to somebody {{who may or may not}} be telling the truth. That struggle informed the character of Alex." [...] He called the series a sexy romance and a political thriller, adding [...] "It's like, what would Die Hard be if Die Hard was weekly and was also a soap".|$|E
500|$|Despite its chart success, I Want You {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics {{at the time}} of its release. It has been noted by music writers that the critical reception of disco music in general had been poor and ill-considered, which may have caused the slightly disco-styled I Want You to suffer critically, in comparison to Gaye's previous albums. Los Angeles Times writer Dennis Hunt called the album [...] "disappointing" [...] and [...] "only partially commendable". Rolling Stones Vince Aletti criticized Leon Ware's production for being too low-key, and perceived that Gaye lacks the certain passion in his lyricism and singing from his previous records. Aletti compared the album to Gaye's previous work, writing [...] that [...] "Gaye seems determined to take over as soul's master philosopher in the bedroom, a position that requires little but an affectation of constant, rather jaded horniness. The pose has already been established in Let's Get It On, on which Gaye was hot, tender, aggressive, soothing and casually raunchy—the modern lover with all his contradictions. I Want You continues in the same vein but with only the faintest traces of the robust passion that shot through and sustained the earlier album... one expects <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little more substance and spirit. But there's no fire here, only a well-concealed pilot light." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1994, {{the label}} {{arranged}} her {{to fly to}} London and meet with producer Tom Bailey. They recorded the songs [...] "I Want You", [...] "Fly" [...] and [...] "Just Like Honey", which was later re-recorded by Keith Fernley of Bailey's group Babble with {{a different set of}} lyrics and became the song [...] "Father's Field". Lords used lyrics she had previously written in New Zealand based on her personal journals she kept since she was a child. After finishing her recording with Bailey, Lords wanted <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> harder edge to add another dimension to her album. She was introduced to producer Ben Watkins of the electronic group Juno Reactor and decided to incorporate more rave sound. Mainly inspired by the music she would hear at warehouse parties during her stay in London, Lords teamed up with American singer Wonder with whom she created the lyrics to the song [...] "Control". Lords later commented on the inspiration behind the album's sound: [...] "It was in England that I fell in love with techno music. I was working in the UK doing some modelling a couple of years ago, and I was sharing a flat with some other girls in South London. We were really broke, and the cheapest place to go and have a good night out were raves - you could get in for about three bucks. So I went to a lot of raves and clubs, and I {{fell in love with the}} music - it was something that wasn't happening in the States at the time." [...] Lords recorded three more songs with Watkins; [...] "Good-N-Evil", [...] "Outlaw Lover" [...] and [...] "Fallen Angel".|$|E
50|$|Parkhouse and Hogan had {{previously}} collaborated on five issues of The Dreaming for Vertigo comics in 1999, and Hogan had {{been wanting to}} collaborate again. When Hogan asked Parkhouse what kind of project {{he would like to}} do, Parkhouse suggested <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> alien. The two worked closely on the broader aspects of the plot, but Hogan developed most of the story. Dark Horse Publisher Mike Richardson provided editorial input that helped Hogan and Parkhouse find the right tone for the narrative.|$|R

I have held the rank of Honorary Uncle to his {{children}} for a quarter of a century, and I went out with him in the trolley-car to visit one of my nieces, who is at Miss Porter's famous school in Farmington. The distance is eight or nine miles. On the way, talking, I illustrated <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> anecdote. This is the anecdote: ...|$|R

[...] That little girl was Flavia. Bradley explains [...] "she walked onto the page of another book I was writing, and simply hijacked the story." [...] "I can't take any credit for Flavia at all," [...] he says. [...] "She just materialized." ...|$|E
2500|$|Band member Ray Tabano {{wrote in}} Walk This Way that the {{abortion}} [...] "really messed Steven up" [...] because {{the child was}} a boy. Tyler wrote, [...] "It was a big crisis. It's a major thing when you're growing <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> woman, but they convinced us {{that it would never}} work out and would ruin our lives. You go to the doctor and they put the needle in her belly and they squeeze the stuff in and you watch. And it comes out dead. I was pretty devastated. In my mind, I'm going, Jesus, what have I done?"

6000|$|The maid was a {{young woman}} of great natural calmness; she was {{accustomed}} to let in visitors who had this air of being annoyed and finding one umbrella too numerous for them. It mattered nothing to her that the gentleman was asking for Dr. Martineau as if he was asking for <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unpleasant taste. Almost imperceptibly she relieved him of his umbrella and juggled his hat and coat on to a massive mahogany stand. [...] "What name, Sir?"

He had a pipe in his mouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away and looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he nodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit down there.|$|R
2500|$|Bristol Motor Speedway {{could very}} easily have opened in 1961 under a {{different}} name. The first proposed site for the speedway was in Piney Flats, Tennessee, but, according to Carl Moore, who built the track along with Larry Carrier and R. G. Pope, the idea met local opposition. So the track {{that could have been}} called Piney Flats International Speedway was built [...] up the road on U.S. Highway 11-E in Bristol. The land upon which Bristol Motor Speedway is built was formerly part of Gray's Dairy, at one point one of the largest dairies in the eastern half of the United States. Larry Carrier and Carl Moore traveled to Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1960 to watch a race and it was then that they decided to build a speedway in northeast Tennessee. However, they wanted a smaller model of CMS, <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more intimate setting and opted to erect a [...] facility instead of mirroring the [...] track in Charlotte.|$|E
2500|$|Dr Sam Coulter-Smith, a {{consultant}} in {{obstetrics and gynaecology}} and a university master in the Rotunda Hospital, {{one of the largest}} maternity hospitals in Ireland, said that it would be preferable to introduce legislation to bring in clarity, saying, [...] "We really do need legislation in this area, otherwise we're going to be at risk of doctors working outside the law, and that's not appropriate." [...] Dr Rhona Mahony, Master of the National Maternity Hospital, said: [...] "It is very disappointing that, 20 years after the 'X-Case', we don't have legislation" [...] and that women [...] "need to know {{that they are going to}} get the appropriate health care that they need" [...] while doctors [...] "need to know that they are also protected in their ability to do their job." [...] Peter Boylan, of the Irish Institute of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: [...] "The current situation is like a sword of Damocles hanging over us. If we do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> good intention, but it turns out to be illegal, the consequences are extremely serious for medical practitioners." ...|$|E
2500|$|McKean and Gaiman {{worked on}} the story and {{concepts}} for the film over a span of two weeks in February 2002 at the Henson's family home. Gaiman stated {{that he wanted to}} do [...] "a sort of Prince and Pauper idea. <b>Something</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> girl who was somehow split into two girls who became one at the end." [...] He {{went on to say that}} he [...] "had an idea of a girl who was part of a traveling theatre and her mother getting sick and having to go off the road", and mentioned that McKean preferred to have a circus over a theatre [...] "because it was more interesting visually." [...] McKean was the one who came up with the idea of the masks and the two mothers. McKean said that Labyrinth provided something of a starting point for the project, and that he liked the [...] "human element of that film," [...] but that ultimately the story of MirrorMask was something that he and Gaiman came up with on their own. Gaiman wrote the screenplay in February 2002, and said that they always knew that it would be a coming of age story about a girl on a quest, but that later they learned [...] "that it really was just the story of the relationship between a girl and her mother." ...|$|E

50|$|Jessop's major {{contribution}} to state theory is in treating the state {{not as an}} entity but as <b>a</b> social relation <b>with</b> differential strategic effects. This means {{that the state is}} not <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> essential, fixed property such as a neutral coordinator of different social interests, an autonomous corporate actor with its own bureaucratic goals and interests, or the 'executive committee of the bourgeoisie' as often described by pluralists, elitists/statists and conventional marxists respectively. Rather, what the state is essentially determined by {{is the nature of the}} wider social relations in which it is situated, especially the balance of social forces.|$|R
2500|$|Like {{the earlier}} {{attempts}} at bands, The Waterfront fizzled out, but in late 1983 Couzens {{decided to try}} again at starting a band, and approached Brown. They decided on Wolstencroft (who had turned down the job of drummer in The Smiths) as drummer and Pete Garner as bassist (despite his admission {{that he could not}} play anything but [...] "Block Buster!"). They also decided that they needed Squire in the band, and when he agreed the band's line-up was cemented. Leaving their previous bands behind, they worked solely on new material. Brown's vocal limitations prompted him to take singing lessons for three weeks. After rehearsing for some time without a band name, Squire came up with [...] "The Stone Roses". Several stories later emerged suggesting that the band had initially been called [...] "English Rose" [...] or that the name was somehow linked to The Rolling Stones, but these were untrue, Brown explaining [...] "No, I don't know where that English Rose story came from. John thought up the name [...] "Stone Roses" [...] - <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> contrast, two words that went against each other". The band rehearsed for six months, during which time Wolstencroft had been auditioning for other bands, and he left to join Terry Hall's band The Colourfield. They got Goodwin to rejoin, but he lasted for only one rehearsal, so they advertised for a replacement and began auditioning, eventually recruiting Alan Wren in May 1984.|$|E
