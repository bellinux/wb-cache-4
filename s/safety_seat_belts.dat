40|$|Injury is {{recognized}} as an increasing public health problem in developing countries. Extensive research on injury control has been conducted in the U. S. and other industrialized countries {{in the past several}} decades, but research {{is still in its infancy}} in developing countries. In this paper, successful interventions for transport and home injuries are reviewed in the context of the developing country setting. The aim is to evaluate injury interventions developed in the industrialized countries and identify those likely to be usable in developing countries. The evaluation criteria used include the efficacy of the interventions, as well as their affordability, feasibility and sustainability. The review demonstrates that while several interventions are available in the field of injury prevention for developing countries to import, caution should be taken in doing this. The use of automobile <b>safety</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belts,</b> bicyclist and motorcyclist helmets, speed limits, laws banning the sale of alcohol at lorry parks, pedestrian crossing signs, adequate roadway lighting, separation of pedestrians from vehicles, conspicuity-enhancement measures, simple safety equipment, and poison prevention packaging should be seriously considered by developing countries to reduce the morbidity and mortality from transport and home injuries. Since injury prevention may often require a blend of several interventions due to the multifactorial nature of the causes of injury, interventions that appear to be most effective are those with multidimensional strategies including education, legislation and environmental modification. This review should serve as a useful guide to injury control efforts in developing countries which must grapple with limited resources and low levels of education. developing countries home injury intervention review transport injury...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore passengers' comfort experience of extra <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> during on-road driving in the rear seat of a passenger car and to investigate how the use of extra belts affects children's and adults' attitudes to the product. Methods: Two different <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> systems were tested, criss-cross (CC) and backpack (BP), consisting of the standard 3 -point belt together with an additional 2 -point belt. In total, 32 participants (15 children aged 6 - 10, 6 youths aged 11 - 15, and 11 adults aged 20 - 79, who differed considerably in size, shape, and proportions) traveled for one hour with each system, including city traffic and highway driving. Four video cameras monitored the test subject during the drive. Subjective data regarding emotions and perceived discomfort were collected in questionnaires every 20 min. A semistructured interview was held afterwards. Results: All participant groups accepted the new products and especially the increased feeling of safety (P <. 01); 56 % preferred CC and 44 % preferred BP but the difference was not significant. In total, 81 % wanted to have extra <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> in their family car. CC was appreciated for its symmetry, comfort, and the perceived feeling of safety. Some participants found CC unpleasant because the belts tended to slip close to the neck, described as a strangling feeling. BP was simpler to use and did not cause annoyance to the neck in the way CC did. Instead, it felt asymmetric and to some extent less safe than CC. Body size and shape affected <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> fit to a great extent, which in turn affected the experience of comfort, both initially and over time. Perceived safety benefit and experienced comfort were the most determinant factors for the attitude toward the extra <b>seat</b> <b>belts.</b> The extra <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> were perceived as being better than the participants had expected before the test, and they became more used to them over time. Conclusion: This exploratory study provided valuable knowledge from a user perspective for further development of new <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> systems in cars. In addition to an increased feeling of <b>safety,</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> fit and comfort are supplementary influencing factors when it comes to gaining acceptance of new <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> systems...|$|R

50|$|Data {{obtained}} from a crash simulation indicate the capability of the car body or guard rail structure to protect the vehicle occupants during a collision (and also pedestrians hit by a car) against injury. Important results are the deformations (for example, steering wheel intrusions) of the occupant space (driver, passengers) and the decelerations (for example, head acceleration) felt by them, which must fall below threshold values fixed in legal car safety regulations. To model real crash tests, today's crash simulations include virtual models of crash test dummies and of passive <b>safety</b> devices (<b>seat</b> <b>belts,</b> airbags, shock absorbing dash boards, etc.).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the implementation of}} an intervention to increase the delivery of adolescent preventive services within a large managed care organization. Target health areas were tobacco, alcohol, sexual behavior, and <b>safety</b> (<b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> and helmet use). DATA SOURCE/STUDY DESIGN: Adolescent reports of clinician screening and counseling were obtained from adolescents who attended well visits with their primary care providers. A prepost study design was used to {{evaluate the}} preventive services intervention. The intervention had three components: (1) 89 clinicians from three outpatient pediatric clinics attended a training to increase the delivery of preventive services; (2) customized adolescent screening and provider charting forms were integrated into the clinics; and (3) the resources of a health educator were provided to the clinics. DATA COLLECTION: Following a visit, adolescents completed surveys reporting on clinician screening and counseling for each of the target risk areas. Preimplementation (three months), 104 adolescents completed surveys. Postimplementation of the training, tools, and health educator intervention, 211 adolescents completed surveys (five months). For 18 months postimplementation clinicians delivered services and 998 adolescents completed surveys. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Chi-square analyses of changes in screening from preimplementation to postimplementation showed that screening increased in all areas (p <. 000), with an average increase in screening rates from 47 percent to 94 percent. Postimplementation counseling in all areas also increased significantly, with an average increase in counseling rates from 39 percent to 91 percent.
