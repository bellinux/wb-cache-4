2500|$|In 1893, BSA {{commenced}} making bicycle hubs {{and continued}} to supply the cycle trade with bicycle parts up to 1936. BSA bought The Eadie Manufacturing Company of Redditch in 1907 and so began to manufacture the Eadie two speed hub gear and the Eadie coaster brake hub. BSA also {{signed an agreement with}} the Three <b>Speed</b> <b>Gear</b> Syndicate in 1907 to manufacture a 3 speed hub under licence. [...] This was later classified as the Sturmey Archer Type X. BSA introduced a 'Duo' hub in the late 1930s which was capable of one fixed gear and one gear with a freewheel. [...] All BSA hub gear production temporarily ceased in 1939, until they recommenced making their 3 speed hub around 1945. The Eadie coaster hub made a brief return in 1953 on two BSA bicycle models.

The gearing losses associated with high <b>speed</b> <b>gearing</b> such as tooth mesh friction, bearing friction, churning, and windage are discussed with various ways shown to help reduce these losses and thereby improve efficiency. Several different methods of oil jet lubrication for high <b>speed</b> <b>gearing</b> are given such as into mesh, out of mesh, and radial jet lubrication. The experiments and analytical results for the various methods of oil jet lubrication are shown with {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of each method discussed.

40|$|LecturePg. 67 - 74 The {{petrochemical}} {{and utility}} industries are experiencing a {{growing demand for}} high power turbogear units for use in large gas turbine compressor and generator drives. A growing number of high <b>speed</b> <b>gears</b> with ratings up to 70, 000 kW are already in service. For such gears, the failure mode of scoring can become the limiting constraint. The validity of an analytical method to predict scoring resistance is, therefore, becoming increasingly important.

40|$|PaperPg. 157 - 163. The most {{effective}} methods for monitoring {{the health of}} high <b>speed</b> <b>gearing</b> is currently generating more interest and discussion than any other aspect of machinery health monitoring. Both structurally and dynamically, a gear {{is quite different from}} the machines coupled to it. As a result, monitoring gear health often requires methods which differ from those that have proven exceptionally effective on other types of critical machinery. This paper describes the dynamics of high <b>speed</b> <b>gears</b> that apply to and influence health monitoring. Various types of monitoring systems that have been proposed and utilized are discussed, followed by the advantages and limitations of each system. Actual case histories are cited to illustrate many of the elements of gear health monitoring. The paper concludes with recommended health monitoring systems for several classes of gears. Each system is described in detail along with the reasons for selecting the specific method...|$|R
