40|$|Based on the Betti-Rayleigh Dynamic Reciprocal Theorem, the {{reciprocal}} {{property of the}} Green's functions is demonstrated, {{on the basis of}} which the analytical solution of soil vibration subjected to moving loads is derived. By application of the Betti-Rayleigh Dynamic Reciprocal Theorem, the moving source problem is converted to the fixed source problem with receiver point moving in opposite direction, which greatly simplifies the complex analytical solution of soil/ground vibration induced by a moving load. A computer code for solving the ground responses subjected to the moving constant load and harmonic load is developed via MATLAB and is employed to perform a case study. The analyzed results show that the ground vibration induced by moving constant load is of typical low-frequency feature; the frequency range of ground vibration is controlled by the Rayleigh's wave velocity of the top layer soil; when the receiver nears the <b>source</b> <b>path,</b> the R-wave contributes to the ground vibration more than the P-wave and the S-wave; while when the receiver is far from the <b>source</b> <b>path,</b> the contribution of the P-wave is more obvious.

In this method, the characteristics of seismic <b>source,</b> <b>path</b> attenuation, and local soil condition are taken into account, when generating synthetic ground motions. Given a moment magnitude and an epicentral distance, we use a stochastic model to generate an acceleration time history at the rock outcrop. Then, we perform a nonlinear site response analysis to generate an acceleration time history at the ground surface. Variability of ground motion resulting from uncertainties in modeling of seismic <b>source,</b> <b>path</b> attenuation, and local site condition {{is not included in}} this report and is addressed in the paper by Hwang (2000). The method has been applied to generate synthetic ground motions resulting from large New Madrid earthquakes. In this study, a deep soil profile overlaying the bedrock was established based on a boring log in the Memphis area. In addition, 12 pairs of moment magnitudes and epicentral distances were selected, and for each pair of moment magnitude and epicentral distance, two samples of ground motion at the rock outcrop and at the ground surface were simulated; thus, a total of 24 synthetic acceleration time histories were generated at the rock outcrop and at the ground surface.

40|$|Objective: For {{commissioning}} of <b>source</b> <b>path</b> mo-dels for ring {{tubes of}} Nucletron (now Elekta) CT/MR ring applicators, a method was established using a source position simulator (SPS) and a CT scanner. Methods: An acrylic glass support for ring tubes was constructed serving as defined coordinate system. With SPS, 40 positions {{were set in}} the ring in steps of 2. 5 mm from proximal to distal direction. In each position a CT-series was taken with ring plane inside scan plane using a GE Optima 580 scanner (slice width 0. 625 mm). Evaluation was done in multiplanar recon-struction mode under display settings revealing dummy source shape. With a 3 D-cursor dwell position coordinate (center of Ir- 192 core) was determined. Measurements were validated by film autoradiography in selected positions. Four rings were investigated: 60 ° Φ 26, 45 ° Φ 26, 60 ° Φ 30, and 45 ° Φ 30 with figures denoting angle between ring plane and stem and ring diameter in mm. Results: The method is feasible to reconstruct source dwell positions with an overall accuracy of ± 0. 3 mm. Detected coordinates are consistent and in excel-lent agreement with those obtained by autoradiography. Comparison with Elekta’s <b>source</b> <b>path</b> models, however, re-vealed mean deviations of up to 3. 5 mm.
