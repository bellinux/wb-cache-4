5|$|Termites can {{be major}} {{agricultural}} pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing {{this is the}} greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to <b>soak</b> <b>in</b> deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, {{making it difficult for}} farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground/purposeDifferent denture {{cleaning}} {{methods have}} different effects. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the efficiency of six different denture cleaning methods to remove Candida albicans that had accumulated on denture-based materials. Materials and methodsWe generated 140 identical acrylic resin specimens and <b>soaked</b> them <b>in</b> a suspension of C albicans. The reduction in microorganism counts after application of the different denture cleaning methods was calculated. Six cleaning methods were evaluated: a mechanical method of brushing with a toothbrush, a chemical method of <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a commercial cleansing tablet solution, a combined method of brushing and <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a commercial cleansing tablet solution, a chemical method of <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a commercial mouthwash solution, irradiation in an ultraviolet (UV) -light e-box, and <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> distilled water. The effectiveness of the denture-cleaning methods in reducing C albicans was evaluated following a single cleaning event. ResultsThe denture cleaning techniques had considerably different efficacies in reducing C albicans. There was no significant difference among the effectiveness levels of cleaning by brushing, <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a commercial cleansing tablet solution, or a combination of both in removing C albicans. Similarly, the effectiveness levels of <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a commercial mouthwash solution or irradiation in a UV-light e-box were statistically similar. ConclusionCompared to other methods, brushing, <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a commercial cleansing tablet solution, or a combination of both methods can significantly reduce the adherence of C albicans to denture samples. Compared to <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> distilled water, <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a commercial mouthwash solution or irradiation with UV-light had more significant cleaning effects, but these methods were not as effective as the aforementioned three methods...|$|R

Probes are generally kept moist when not in use with a medium appropriate for the particular probe, which is typically an aqueous solution available from probe manufacturers. Probe manufacturers provide instructions for cleaning and maintaining their probe designs. For illustration, one maker of laboratory-grade pH gives cleaning instructions for specific contaminants: general cleaning (15-minute <b>soak</b> <b>in</b> a solution of bleach and detergent), salt (hydrochloric acid solution followed by sodium hydroxide and water), grease (detergent or methanol), clogged reference junction (KCl solution), protein deposits (pepsin and HCl, 1% solution), and air bubbles.|$|E
