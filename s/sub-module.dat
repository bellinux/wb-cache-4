We show that the throughput assumption about the transform <b>sub-module</b> in most research works is overly optimistic since it does not consider the complexity of a rate-distortion optimized video coding process. Many HEVC coding options are compared in terms of impact on quality and throughput, so to recommend the most efficient settings without excessively penalizing quality. Moreover, comparisons with the AVC standard show that, in general, HEVC presents much higher complexity to deliver its claimed compression advantages. Finally, a practical case study is shown to highlight how the proposed transform throughput analysis could be used to determine the throughput for a transform <b>sub-module</b> hardware design...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{nucleosome}} remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) {{complex is}} a highly conserved regulator of chromatin structure and transcription. Structural studies have shed light on this and other chromatin modifying machines, but much less is known about how they assemble and whether stable and functional <b>sub-modules</b> exist that retain enzymatic activity. Purification of the endogenous Drosophila NuRD complex shows that it consists of a stable core of subunits, while others, in particular the chromatin remodeler CHD 4, associate transiently. To dissect the assembly and activity of NuRD, we systematically produced all possible combinations of different components using the MultiBac system, and determined their activity and biophysical properties. We carried out single-molecule imaging of CHD 4 in live mouse embryonic stem cells, in the presence and absence of one of core components (MBD 3), {{to show how the}} core deacetylase and chromatin-remodeling <b>sub-modules</b> associate in vivo. Our experiments suggest a pathway for the assembly of NuRD via preformed and active <b>sub-modules.</b> These retain enzymatic activity and are present in both the nucleus and the cytosol, an outcome with important implications for understanding NuRD function...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} a switching-level operation analysis of BTB(Back-To-Back) converter for HVDC(high voltage DC) application based on MMC(modular multi-level converter). A switching-level operation analysis for BTB converter {{is very important}} to understand the converter operation in detail and check the voltage and current transients in each components. However, the development of switching-level simulation model for the actual size BTB Converter is very difficult because the MMC normally has more than 150 <b>sub-modules</b> for each arm. So, a switching level simulation model for the 11 -level MMC-based BTB converter was developed with PSCAD/EMTDC software, which has 12 <b>sub-modules</b> for the positive arm and another 12 <b>sub-modules</b> for the negative arm. The DC-voltage balance algorithm, the circulating-current reduction algorithm, the harmonic reduction algorithm, and the redundancy operation algorithm were included in this simulation model. The developed simulation model can be utilized to analyze the MMC-based BTB converter for HVDC application in switching level and to develop the protection scheme for the MMC-based BTB converter for HVDC application.
