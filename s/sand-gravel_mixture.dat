In the present study, a series of conventional triaxial compression tests were conducted on a cemented poorly graded <b>sand–gravel</b> <b>mixture</b> containing 30 % gravel and 70 % sand in both consolidated drained and undrained conditions. Portland cement used as the cementing agent {{was added to the}} soil at 0 %, 1 %, 2 %, and 3 % (dry weight) of <b>sand–gravel</b> <b>mixture.</b> Samples were prepared at 70 % relative density and tested at confining pressures of 50  kPa, 100  kPa, and 150  kPa. Comparison of the results with other studies on well graded gravely sands indicated more dilation or negative pore pressure in poorly graded samples. Undrained failure envelopes determined using zero Skempton's pore pressure coefficient (A¯= 0) criterion were consistent with the drained ones. Energy absorption potential was higher in drained condition than undrained condition, suggesting that more energy was required to induce deformation in cemented soil under drained state. Energy absorption increased with increase in cement content under both drained and undrained conditions...|$|E

30|$|Use of {{granular}} piles, GP, in weak soils (e.g., soft {{clay and}} loose sand) {{is now a}} well known ground improvement technique. In case of loose granular soil, the provision of granular pile enhances the bearing capacity of foundation and reduces its total and differential settlements. However, in case of soft cohesive soil, it has an additional advantage of providing a drainage path, which increases the rate of consolidation. Granular piles may be fully penetrated and resting on strong soil layer (i.e., end bearing granular piles, EBGP) or partially penetrated (i.e., floating granular piles, FGP). The floating granular piles are considered an economic alternative system to fully penetrated granular piles in case of deep weak soil layer or in case of lightly loaded structures.

40|$|A {{total of}} 87 direct shear tests {{in a large}} direct shear-box {{apparatus}} {{have been used to}} investigate the strength and dilatancy of <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixtures.</b> This paper focuses on the differences in behaviour between a silica sand (yellow Leighton Buzzard sand) and <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixtures</b> obtained by adding fractions of two kinds of gravel to the sand. The purpose is to find a relation between the grain-size characteristics of the materials and the shearing resistance. Experimental results are analysed in terms of the frictional and dilatant contributions to the strength of mixtures as a function of their relative density, and are compared with dilatancy theories and empirical equations. The addition of gravel to the mixtures, even at low fractions (less than 0. 1 by volume), causes an increase in peak friction angle (φ′peak) which results both from higher dilatancy at failure (ψmax) and higher constant volume friction angle (φ′cv). Use of the minimum voids ratio (emin) of the materials allows the data for the two families of mixtures to be normalized and interpreted in terms of φ ′cv and the ratio (φ′peak -φ′cv/ψmax. The relationships between relative density (Dr), ψmax and φ′peak-φ′cv are only partly explained on a physical basis, so we develop empirical equations to predict the peak shear resistance of <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixtures</b> (up to gravel contents of 0. 5) on the basis of easily measurable quantities. Such equations constitute a practical tool to overcome the problems arising from the impracticality of testing coarse material in the standard shear-box apparatus. © Springer 2006...|$|R
40|$|Soils {{containing}} dispersed and non-dispersed large particles (greater than # 4 sieve) {{form part}} of many engineered fills, glacial tills, debris flows, and residual soil deposits. Very {{little is known about}} the effect that the large particles have on the shear strength of the soil-large particles mixtures. In this study, the influence of the large particles on the shear strength of the mixtures was evaluated experimentally and numerically. The experimental analysis used direct shear tests on simulated granular materials containing large dispersed particles as well as on real <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The numerical analysis used the Discrete Element Method (DEM). For the dispersed case (the large particles are not in contact), the laboratory and the DEM simulation results indicated that the shear strength of the mixtures increased with the concentration (C) of the large particles in the mixtures. The shear strength of the mixtures with dispersed oversize particles can be obtained from the following relationship: Sc = Sm (1 + αC). In this relationship, Sc is the shear strength of the mixture, Sm is the shear strength of the granular matrix without the oversize particles, C is the concentration by volume of the oversize particles, and α is a constant that varies between 0. 4 and 2. 5. For the case of the non-dispersed oversize particles (the oversize particles are in contact in the mixture), direct shear tests on <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixtures</b> indicated the shear strength of the mixtures can be obtained from the following relationship: Sc = Sm (1 + 0. 7 C + 1. 8 C 2).

Using the theory of hereditary creep generalizing models for calculating the plastic deformation of the cyclic loading were obtained. The proposed method of calculating the residual deformations of granular materials by cyclic loading is integrating the power functions describing the increment of plastic strain.

40|$|AbstractA {{total of}} 27 large scale direct shear tests have been {{conducted}} to investigate the shear strength and dilatancy of well graded <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixtures.</b> This paper focuses on the differences in behavior between three soils: sandy gravel with a specified gradation as the base soil, and two other ones with equivalent scalped or parallel gradations. Direct shear tests were conducted on three considered soils. Maximum grain size is 25. 4 mm in base soil, and is limited to 12. 5 mm for equivalent scalped and parallel gradations. Test results are considered in terms of frictional and dilatancy contributions to the shear strength {{as a function of}} relative density and applied surcharge pressure. According to the results, the gradation of tested soils affects their shear strength by a change in maximum friction angle, which can be related to both dilatancy at failure and the constant volume friction angle. Scalped gradation is found as a better approximate gradation compared to the parallel one for determination of peak shear strength for coarse grained soils. Finally, empirical equations are developed to relate the shear strength characteristics of the base gradation to scalped and parallel ones...|$|R
40|$|Additional master thesis - To {{mitigate}} {{the effects of}} the hydropower dam development on the Mekong river system, research must be done on the effects of sediment catchment of these dams. With unknown amounts of sediment, stored in the banks and in local bars, all spread over this long bedrock channel, local sediment transports are hard to predict. Especially, in the case of implementation of a dam, the reduction in available sediment and so the sediment transport is difficult to determine. In this research different Delft 3 D input is tested to model the reduction in sediment transport. The various options were the local change of roughness, change of threshold for sediment reduction for sediment close to non-erodible layers, increasing the density (locally) of sediment, controlling the maximum erosion as percentage of the water depth and the local change of available sediment at the bed. This was all done using two different sediment transport formulations of Wilcock, both for <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The best solution {{turned out to be the}} change of the threshold for sediment reduction for sediment close to non-erodible layers. However, disadvantage here, was the inability to change this parameter locally, to be able to determine where sediment buffers in the model are located.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has indicated that variability of antecedent flows is a fundamental control on the entrainment and transport of sediment in river systems. Specifically, the low flows between successive floods appear to have a far greater influence on the stability of a river bed than previously assumed. Increased durations of low flows increase sand-gravel bed stability so as to delay entrainment and significantly reduce transport. Although a degree of quantification of “memory stress” effects has been attempted by previous researchers, their applied methodology precludes development of appropriate mathematical relationships implicit to correcting existing sediment transport equations. The overall aim of this thesis is therefore to address this deficiency via robust physical and mathematical modelling. In total, 84 flume experiments were carried out in a flume. Two poorly sorted (g ≥ 1. 6) <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixtures</b> of unimodal and bimodal distribution were compared and contrasted for sensitivity of modality to memory effects upon bedload and entrainment threshold. Five memory timescales (10, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes) were tested and contrasted with baseline data obtained for runs performed without any memory. Experiments employed a stepped discharge hydrograph covering sub-threshold to fully mobile conditions. A reference transport based approach was employed to determine entrainment threshold, and to develop mathematical descriptors of memory effects. Results show that increasing memory timescales up to 240 minutes increases entrainment thresholds () by up to 49...|$|R

To bring this technology closer to field scale, a PVC column (12 inch [30. 5 cm] diameter x 48 inches [121. 9 cm] high) was constructed {{to examine the effects}} of thick biofilms in porous media under radial flow conditions. Bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens, a facultative anaerobe capable of denitrification) and nutrients were injected down a center injection well and allowed to flow radially outward through a <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixture</b> to the edge of the column. The bacteria were allowed to grow on the surface of the porous medium and produce thick biofilms that reduced the hydraulic conductivity of the soil. Nitrate was added as the electron acceptor to the column to facilitate denitrification during anaerobic growth. Bacterial growth created a reactive biobarrier that not only reduced the hydraulic conductivity of the soil, but also completely utilized nitrate and dissolved oxygen within 24 hours, creating anaerobic conditions throughout the column.

40|$|If a {{partially}} mobile sediment is transported an immobile sediment layer can form below the bedforms. This immobile layer {{can cause a}} supply-limitation, i. e. the volume of mobile sediment {{on top of the}} layer available for transport becomes limited. This causes the bedforms, roughness and sediment transport to be reduced compared to alluvial conditions, i. e. the situation where all bed surface material consists of mobile sediment. We studied the development of the bed stratification in a series of flume experiments with different initial sand-gravel mixtures. In all experiments a thin immobile gravel layer developed with supply-limited bedforms on top; showing a strong similarity with the supply-limitation as observed in situations of sand transport over pre-installed flat immobile beds. Two phases were observed in the temporal development of the stratified bed: I) first a relatively quick development of dunes with gravel accumulating in the dune troughs, followed by II) a slower development of the level of the immobile gravel layer in the bed. In the final equilibrium situation the thickness and composition of the immobile layer appeared to be more or less independent of the initial <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixture</b> composition. However, the thickness of the mobile sediment layer (active layer) and the average dune height strongly reduced with increasing gravel concentration in the initial mixture...|$|E

This study investigated the applicability of time domain reflectometry (TDR) for the determination of θ. Although TDR is commonly applied to soils, only a few researchers have explored the sensitivity of its measurements to various parameters in MSW, which is a heterogeneous and time-evolving material. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the calibration of TDR probes in MSW and to quantify the sensitivity of the method to the waste's characteristics and to the distribution of water in the material. The sensitivity of TDR was quantified relative to MSW composition and density, the initial θ and θ distribution, the electrical conductivity (EC) of the fluid, and the rate of change in θ. Experiments were conducted on two different waste materials and on a <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixture</b> in a small-scale laboratory cell. The relationship between TDR measurement and true θ was calibrated for all experiments.

40|$|The general {{aim of this}} PhD-project was to gain better {{understanding}} of the sediment transport and depositional processes of <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixtures</b> in rivers with subaqueous dunes. The understanding of the fundamental processes of sediment transport and deposition in channel beds is crucial for morphological models. Sand-gravel bed rivers have a mixture of sand and gravel in their beds, and have dunes while the coarsest sediment is near incipient motion. In this thesis, the sediment transport, sorting and deposition processes are studied with field measurements and laboratory experiments. Existing bedform stability diagrams were shown to be valid for bedforms observed in sand- gravel bed rivers and experiments, but new bedform types were identified as well: sand ribbons, barchans and bedload sheets. When the bed surface is armoured, barchans and sand ribbons are dependend on the sediment supply from upstream. This supply is often not predictable from the local hydraulics and sediment characteristics. A predictor for bedload transport of sediment mixtures was developed by extending existing deterministic bedload transport predictors to non-uniform sediment, based on flume experiments reported herein. The near-bed turbulence is modelled stochastically to obtain realistic bedload transport rates at incipient motion. The difference in mobility of small and large grains is represented by hiding-exposure functions. The transport predictor was tested on data from the river Rhine, the Netherlands during a discharge wave in 1998. For the measurements, a new measurement strategy was developed during a discharge wave in 1997, leading to an uncertainty in transport rates of less than 20...|$|R
40|$|Lake Rotoma {{is a deep}} (70 - 80 m), oligotrophic, warm {{monomictic}} lake {{of volcanic}} origin with insignificant stream inflow and no clearly defined outflow. For at least 60 years up to 1972 the lake level fluctuated markedly about an overall rising trend of some 6 - 10 m. Nearshore profiles {{are related to the}} prevailing wave climate superimposed upon the overall rising lake level, shelves being wider, less steep, and deeper about the more exposed eastern and southern shorelines. The outer portions of shelves extending well below modern storm wave base into waters as deep as 15 - 25 m are relict features from lower lake level stands. Sediments fine from <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixtures</b> nearshore to silts in basinal areas. Their composition reflects a composite provenance involving the lavas and tephras about the lake, as well as intralake diatom frustules and organic matter. The distribution pattern of surficial bottom sediments is an interplay between grains of both biological and terrigenous origin, supplied presently and in the past by a variety of processes, that have been dispersed either by the modern hydrodynamic regime or by former ones associated with lower lake levels. These interrelationships are structured by erecting 5 process-age sediment classes in the lake, namely neoteric, amphoteric, proteric, palimpsest, and relict sediments, analogous to categories postulated for sediments on oceanic continental shelves. Short-core stratigraphy includes the Kaharoa (A. D. - 1020) and Tarawera (A. D. 1886) tephras.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{particle}} shape on {{the angle of}} internal friction, and the resulting impact on beach sediment dynamics, is still poorly understood. In areas characterized by sediments of specific shape, particularly non-rounded particles, {{this can lead to}} large departures from the expected sediment dynamics. The steep slope (1 : 10) of the mixed sand–gravel beach at Advocate Harbour is stable in large-scale morphology over decades, despite a high tidal range of 10 m or more, and intense shore-break action during storms. The Advocate sand (d < 2 mm) was found to have an elliptic, plate-like shape (Corey Shape Index, CSI ≈ 0. 2 – 0. 6). High angles of internal friction of this material were determined using direct shear, ranging from φ ≈ 41 to 49 °, while the round to angular gravel was characterized as φ = 33 °. The addition of 25 % of the elliptic plate-like sand-sized material to the gravel led to an immediate increase in friction angle to φ = 38 °. Furthermore, re-organization of the particles occurred during shearing, characterized by a short phase of settling and compaction, followed by a pronounced strong dilatory behavior and an accompanying strong increase of resistance to shear and, thus, shear stress. Long-term shearing (24 h) using a ring shear apparatus led to destruction of the particles without re-compaction. Finally, submerged particle mobilization was simulated using a tilted tray submerged in a water-filled tank. Despite a smooth tray surface, particle motion was not initiated until reaching tray tilt angles of 31 ° and more, being ≥ 7 ° steeper than for motion initiation of the gravel mixtures. In conclusion, geotechnical laboratory experiments quantified the important impact of the elliptic, plate-like shape of Advocate Beach sand on the angles of internal friction of both pure sand and <b>sand–gravel</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The resulting effect on initiation of particle motion was confirmed in tilting tray experiments. This makes it a vivid example of how particle shape can contribute to the stabilization of the beach face...|$|R
40|$|Alternate bars {{were formed}} by {{sediment}} transport in a flume with Froude-modelled flow and relative roughness characteristic of gravel-boulder channels with steep slopes. The flume (0. 3 m wide x 7. 5 m long) {{was filled with}} a <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixture,</b> which was also fed into the top of the flume at a constant rate under constant discharge. Channel slope was set at 0. 03. Initially, coarse particles accumulated on incipient bar heads near one side of the flume and diverted flow and bedload transport across the flume toward a pool scoured against the opposite flume wall downstream. Sorting in the pool directed coarse particles onto the next bar head downstream. Alternate sequences of pools and coarse bar heads were thereby linked down the entire flume by interactions of sediment sorting, flow, and channel morphology. During episodes of bar construction, unsorted bedload invaded interior bar surfaces and was deposited. Persistent deposition of coarse particles on bar heads prevented downstream migration of bars by inhibiting bar-head erosion and bedload transport over bars. Likely factors leading to bar-head stabilization in modelled gravel-bed channels are coarse mixed-size sediment, steep channel gradients, and shallow depths.

Four substrates with different crevice features were subjected to three levels of abrasion in a stream-based experiment. Substrates were sand-grain caddisfly cases and three glass rod substrates that mimicked caddisfly cases in size and shape, as well as forming a gradient of larger crevices (i. e., smooth with no crevices, sanded with shallow pits, and scratched with deeper grooves). Substrates were subjected to no, low, or high abrasion levels during 18 d of incubation by pulling substrates through a <b>sand–gravel</b> <b>mixture</b> in floating enclosures that housed the experiment. Diatom density, relative biovolume, location in crevices, detritus accumulation, and filamentous algal density were compared among substrate types and abrasion levels. Across all abrasion levels, diatom and filamentous algal densities were higher on caddisfly cases than on all three glass rod substrates. Although abrasion greatly reduced overall diatom density, diatoms within crevices were largely protected. Crevice size influenced diatom size and composition. The small crevices of sanded rods contained primarily small diatoms of a single species (Achnanthidium minutissimum), whereas the larger crevices of scratched rods and caddisfly cases contained a greater range of diatom size and, consequently, greater species diversity. Detritus accumulated in all crevices, and accumulation increased with level of abrasion. Diatom biovolume decreased and location in crevices increased with the level o...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a Gilbert-type delta progradation experiment within an impoundment created by a dam. The delta was composed of a poorly sorted <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mixture</b> in a bedload-dominated environment. The main goal of the paper is to analyse the sorting process of material within the deposit as the delta progrades towards the dam. Bed profile evolution has been documented and the entire delta has been extensively sampled in order to study sorting processes. Longitudinal and vertical sorting mechanisms are illustrated. What is novel in this investigation is the complete record, within an entire deltaic deposit, of the vertical distribution of streamwise sorting in the absence of suspended load. The data presented herein provide a detailed description of sorting processes in a Gilbert-type delta. The experimental set-up, the water flow and the sediment feed rate chosen determine the evolution of the delta: it initially progrades with little topset aggradation and degrades afterwards. Experimental results fit well with a previously presented empirical sorting model, {{despite the fact that the}} experimental conditions used here were well outside the range of those used to derive that model. The relative coarsening of the upper layers of the delta is found to be related to the slow speed at which the delta progrades, the formation of a mobile armour layer and the erosion of the topset towards the end of the run. Furthermore, a strong correlation between the coarsening of the bottom layer of the delta and its front height has been documented and explained: as the delta gets higher, as there is more space to sort sediment, it is more likely that coarse particles failing near the top of the foreset reach the bottom of the foreset. These findings provide new and useful data documenting sediment sorting in granular, bedload-dominated deltas. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|E
