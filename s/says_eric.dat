The light dies away, and Eric thinks on sweet Gudruda and makes ready to die also, when suddenly a last ray from the sun falls on the fierce face of Skallagrim, and lo! Brighteyes sees it change, for the madness goes out of it, and in a moment the Baresark becomes but as a child in his mighty grip.|$|E

5000|$|In his 2006 book “The Schreiber Theory: A Radical Rewrite of American Film History”, David Kipen {{argues that}} the {{influential}} 1950s-era Auteur theory has wrongly skewed analysis towards a director-centred view of film.

5000|$|By {{the late}} 1800s, X̱wáýx̱way {{was the largest}} {{settlement}} {{in what is now}} Stanley Park. [...] In the village, a big house or longhouse measured at 60 meters long and near 20 meters wide. The structure was built with large cedar posts and slabs. 11 families lived in the house, numbering around 100 people. A large potlatch, a ceremonial event conducted by wealthy families, was held at this house in 1875. This event is also mentioned in the city council meeting minutes, where the medical health officer recommended the destruction of the buildings because of a smallpox outbreak, <b>says</b> <b>Eric</b> McLay, president of the Archeology Society of B.C.|$|E
5000|$|Romantic {{stories about}} the royalty of a fictional kingdom were common, for {{instance}} Robert Louis Stevenson's Prince Otto (1885). But it was the great popularity of Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda (1894) which set the type, with its handsome political decoy restoring the rightful king to the throne, and resulted {{in a burst of}} similar popular fiction, such as George Barr McCutcheon's Graustark novels (1901-27) and Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Lost Prince (1915), and other homages. In children's literature, the 1938 - 39 The Adventures of Tintin comic King Ottokar's Sceptre eschewed literal romance, but is an adventure about foiling a plot to depose the king of Syldavia. Literary critic John Sutherland <b>says</b> <b>Eric</b> Ambler brought the Ruritarian romance to [...] "its highest pitch" [...] with his 1939 novel The Mask of Dimitrios.|$|E

40|$|Not {{only were}} the {{histories}} of the Negro in America and railroading inseparable, <b>says</b> <b>Eric</b> Arnesen in his superb study of African Americans and the railroad industry, but so too was the history of railroading predicated upon racial divisions of labor (p. 5). These two fine studies describe both {{the central role of}} African Americans in America s railroads and the place of racial discrimination in rail employment. More, they show how railroad labor struggles were the proving ground for the larger struggles for civil rights and racial equality. ...|$|E
40|$|Socialists {{have not}} {{sufficiently}} appreciated {{the magnitude and}} quality of changes which {{have taken place in}} the last twenty or thirty years, <b>says</b> <b>Eric</b> Aarons. The way we look at the world, the connections we see (or fail to see) between politics and other aspects of society, and the absence of a philosophy which can make more cohesive the diversity of radical and leftwing thought, {{are some of the things}} we need to address, he argues. In the following extract from the book Moving Left: the future of socialism in Australia, he looks at some of the long-term questions confronting socialists in Australia...|$|E

40|$|Big {{data has}} {{acquired}} {{the trappings of}} religion. McKinsey is its high priest, the Cameron and Obama governments its acolytes, taking their lesson from the gospel according to Open Data. Its bible, like the Old Testament, is full of floods: {{a rising tide of}} data, nay a very tsunami, will sweep us away unless we accept the truth of the great A, analytics. Data analytics are to be bowed down to and worshipped. For now professional statisticians are milling {{at the back of the}} church, mesmerised by the gaudy spectacle before them. Flattered, they can hear the priests talking in glowing, future-oriented terms. One, Hal Varian of Google, even called statistics “the sexy job of the next ten years” 1. Wow! Who ever called statistics sexy before? But big data is a them-and-us creed. It does not, for example, include big detail on Google’s tax returns. Feeding revenues through a layer of jurisdictions, the internet giant ends up paying tiny sums in most countries where it does busi-ness, including the UK. Which is not odd at all, <b>says</b> <b>Eric</b> Schmidt, its executive chairman: hey, it’s only capitalism 2. At that point, statisticians might have doc-trinal second thoughts. Not because they are inclined to be left-wing (there is no evidence of that), but because they have professional pride and rigorous standards: becoming “datanauts” might tie their discipline to the chariot of profit maximization and shareholder value. And that vehicle has been known to ride roughshod over the public interest and sometimes even the truth. Big data is principally about taking more money off customers by (let us put it pejo-ratively) more effective snooping on their habits. If Google can predict a flu outbreak by monitoring traffic on its systems (se...|$|E
40|$|Every medium {{has been}} used to tell stories, <b>says</b> <b>Eric</b> Goldberg, one of my oldest friends and {{president}} of Unplugged Games. “That's true of books and theater and radio drama and movies. It's true of games as well. ” I have this argument all the time, and I think Goldberg's statement is balderdash. It's not true of music, music is pleasing sound, that's all. Yes, you can tell a story with music, ballads do that. So do many pop songs. Certainly some types of music [...] opera, ballet, the musical [...] are “story-telling musical forms,” but music it self is not a story-telling medium. The pleasure people derive from music is not dependent on its ability to tell stories: Tell me the story of The Brandenberg Concertoes. Nor is gaming a storytelling medium. The pleasure people derive from games is not dependent on their ability to tell stories. The idea that games {{have something to do with}} stories has such a hold on designers'and gamers'imagination that it probably can't be expunged, but it deserves at least to be challenged. Game designers need to understand that gaming is not inherently a storytelling medium any more than is music [...] and that this is not a flaw, that our field is not intrinsically inferior to, say, film, merely because movies are better at story-telling. Nevertheless, there are games that tell stories [...] roleplaying games and graphic adventures among others [...] and the intersection of game and story, the places where the two (often awkwardly) meet has bred a wide variety of interesting game styles. Examining them is useful, because doing so illuminates the differences between game and story [...] and the ways in which stories can be used to strengthen (and sometimes hinder) games...|$|E
40|$|We {{know that}} our gas-guzzling cars are warming the planet, the {{pesticides}} and fertilizers from farms are turning rivers toxic, and the earth has run out of space for the mountains of unrecycled waste our daily consumption has left in its wake. We’ve heard copious accounts of our impact—as humans, as a society—on the natural world. But {{this is not a}} one-sided relationship. Lost in these dire and scolding accounts has been the impact on us and our well-being. You sense it while walking on a sandy beach, or in a wild, woody forest, or when you catch sight of wildlife, or even while gardening in your backyard. Could it be that the natural environment {{is an essential part of}} our happiness? Yes, <b>says</b> <b>Eric</b> Lambin emphatically in An Ecology of Happiness. Using a very different strategy in addressing environmental concerns, he asks us to consider that there may be no better reason to value and protect the health of the planet than for our own personal well-being. In this clever and wide-ranging work, Lambin draws on new scientific evidence in the fields of geography, political ecology, environmental psychology, urban studies, and disease ecology, among others, to answer such questions as: To what extent do we need nature for our well-being? How does environmental degradation affect our happiness? What can be done to protect the environment and increase our well-being at the same time? Drawing on case studies from Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America, Lambin makes a persuasive case for the strong link between healthy ecosystems and happy humans. Unique in its scope and evenhanded synthesis of research from many fields, An Ecology of Happiness offers a compelling human-centered argument that is impossible to overlook when we marvel at murmurations of starlings or seek out the most brilliant fall foliage: nature makes our steps a little lighter and our eyes a little brighter. What better reason to protect an ecosystem or save a species than for our own pleasure...|$|E

5000|$|Eric has {{had many}} typical teenage jobs over the series. He {{has worked at}} Fatso Burger, PriceMart, a dog food factory and as a waiter at the Holiday Hotel. In the {{beginning}} of the series, Red vehemently opposes Eric's attempts to get a job during the second season citing that it would interfere with his schoolwork and make it harder for him to get into a good college located far away. Kitty supports Red by <b>saying</b> <b>Eric's</b> job is being her [...] "precious little baby boy." [...] When Eric announces his marriage proposal to Red and Kitty, Red fires him from his job at PriceMart so he couldn't make the money to get married. Kitty costs him a potential job at a bank for the same reason. Red and Kitty even {{go so far as to}} revoke their offer to pay for Eric's college tuition in a final act of desperation to put a stop to the wedding but are unsuccessful. In season seven, Eric is ridiculed by his father when he takes a year off from school and work to contemplate his future and enjoy being lazy.

"Well, {{there is}} a reason that the sound of our music has changed and it's not because we've sold out, easy for me to <b>say.</b> <b>Eric,</b> our {{keyboard}} player used to write most of our songs. He was the main creative force in the band for many years. And at a certain point after that first album came out, he had this personal thing, like he didn't like touring, he didn't like all that stuff. He just liked to sit down and write songs. That's him. He's the artistic side, the total Mr. Creative.Well what happened is when Eric decided to leave the band it left the song writing to us, me, Gwen, Tony, the rest of us and it's a really natural thing for our song writing style to be different than Eric's. Just we're different people. I mean we've learned a lot from him and he taught us {{a lot of things about}} song writing, but we write simpler music. We have a simpler style. We're not quite Genius like him I think. This album was our first attempt. it was Gwen's first time really writing all the lyrics herself so to me, it went the opposie from selling out we have done something that is even more personal.
