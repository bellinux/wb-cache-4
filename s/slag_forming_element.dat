This paper presents the effects of reduction temperature, addition of ferro-silicon and addition of <b>slag</b> <b>forming</b> agents for the production of high carbon ferro-chromium by utilization of self-reducing pellets. These pellets were composed of Brazilian chromium ore (chromite) concentrate, petroleum coke, Portland cement, ferro-silicon and <b>slag</b> <b>forming</b> components (silica and hydrated lime). The pellets were processed at 1 773 K, 1 823 K and 1 873 K using an induction furnace. The products obtained, containing slag and metallic phases, were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and chemical analyses (XEDS). A large effect on the reduction time was observed by increasing the temperature from 1 773 K to 1 823 K for pellets without Fe-Si addition: around 4 times faster at 1 823 K than at 1 773 K for reaction fraction close to one. However, when the temperature was further increased from 1 823 K to 1 873 K the kinetics improved by double. At 1 773 K, the addition of 2 % of ferro-silicon in the pellet resulted in an increasing reaction rate of around 6 times, in comparison with agglomerate without it. The addition of fluxing agents (silica and lime), which <b>form</b> initial <b>slag</b> before the reduction is completed, impaired the full reduction.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of convex-concave landslopes {{is described by}} empirical equations, so that shape, scale, and <b>form</b> <b>elements</b> may be compared numerically. Gradient-length relations determine intervals over which particular <b>form</b> <b>elements</b> exist, and over which particular equations apply. Three segments of slopes are defined, an upper convex ele-ment, a middle straight element, and a lower concave element, where the change in gradient with length is respectively positive, zero, and negative. The use of gradient data allows accurate definition of <b>form</b> <b>elements</b> and the intervals over which they exist. Use of pro-file data alone results in incorrect determination of <b>form</b> <b>elements</b> and inaccurate numerical description. The slopes studied occur in southwestern Ohio, have straight contours, and are de-veloped on kames, end moraines, and shale hills.
