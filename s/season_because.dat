Joining news that Amy Rodriguez would be out for the <b>season</b> <b>because</b> of pregnancy and Megan Rapinoe would be returning mid-season after a six-month stint for Olympique Lyonnais, the Reign faced a tough first half of the season and went 0–9–1 in their first ten games.

5|$|Wilson {{chose not}} to sign with any team before the 2013 <b>season</b> <b>because</b> {{he wanted to be}} 100% {{recovered}} from surgery when he attempted his comeback. On July 25, he threw a bullpen session in front of various teams' scouts with the hope to sign with a contender.|$|E
5|$|According to USA Today, the match-up {{between the}} Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes (OSU) {{was one of}} the most-anticipated games of the 2005season. Teams have become {{increasingly}} conservative in scheduling highly ranked non-conference opponents, so a meeting of the number 2 and number 4 teams in the country was unusual this early in the <b>season.</b> <b>Because</b> of the significance of the game in the national championship race, ESPN College GameDay chose the game as the site of its weekly broadcast. The American Football Coaches Association brought the national championship trophy to the game and displayed it on the field near Bevo, the UT mascot (photo below).|$|E

5|$|Adults {{and their}} young may be preyed upon by {{mammalian}} predators, {{such as the}} red fox (Vulpes vulpes) or the feral cat (Felis catus), and native predatory birds, such as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbird species (Cracticus spp.), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) and reptiles such as goannas. Another threat to the birds is from humans; many nests are trampled on (even by the occasional bird watcher) during breeding <b>season</b> <b>because</b> the nests are hidden {{close to the ground}} and therefore difficult for passers-by to spot.|$|E
5|$|Also injured was Virginia Tech wide {{receiver}} Ricky Scales. Scales didn't play for 10 weeks {{during the regular}} <b>season</b> <b>because</b> of surgery to an injured tendon. Despite playing in only four games during the season, he finished the regular season as the Hokies' No. 5 receiver, catching 13 passes for 298 yards. Scales' injury caused the Hokies to be ranked among {{the worst in the}} Big East in receiving yardage, averaging less than 180 yards per game through the air. As the game moved closer, however, Scales recovered from his injury and appeared near full strength.|$|E

Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards. He also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP Awards in the All-Star Game, regular season and NBA Finals, Willis Reed having achieved the first, during the 1969–70 <b>season.</b> <b>Because</b> this was Jordan's first championship since his father's murder, and it was won on Father's Day, Jordan reacted very emotionally upon winning the title, including a memorable scene of him crying on the locker room floor with the game ball.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 2016, {{prior to}} the 2016–17 season, Bozon {{was traded to the}} Florida Panthers in {{exchange}} for Jonathan Racine.

50|$|Like {{other types}} of oden, Shizuoka oden is {{particularly}} suitable for consumption in the colder <b>seasons</b> <b>because</b> of the warming effect it has, much like hot soups and stews served in other countries with cold seasons. Hot (spicy) karashi mustard goes well with it.|$|R
50|$|Various manufacturers' {{brochures}} {{claim that}} crops perform well during hot and dry <b>seasons</b> <b>because</b> roots penetrate soil layers deeper to reach moisture and nutrients.
