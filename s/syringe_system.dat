For this purpose, a small quantity of blood (10 - 15 ml) {{is drawn from}} a superficial vein (such as the antecubital {{in the same way}} as in the case of a blood test. In a second step, a centrifuge is used to separate the ACP from the other blood components. For this purpose, centrifugation only needs to be carried out for a short interval at low speed. In the next step, the ACP can be separated as a supernatant. Manufacturers such as Arthrex offer dedicated syringe systems for this purpose that can be used to take blood from the patient, [...] it, and then inject it again into the region to be treated. In this respect, the blood product remains in the <b>syringe</b> <b>system</b> throughout the entire process, offering the maximum possible level of protection against contamination.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Wood can {{be largely}} {{credited}} with the popularization and acceptance of injection as a medical technique, {{as well as the}} widespread use and acceptance of the hypodermic needle. The basic technology of the hypodermic needle has stayed largely unchanged since the 19th century, but as the years progressed and medical and chemical knowledge improved, small refinements have been made to increase safety and efficacy, with needles being designed and tailored for very particular uses. The trend of needle specification for use began in the 1920s, particularly for the administration of insulin to diabetics. The onset of World War II spurred the early development of partially disposable syringes for the administration of morphine and penicillin on the battlefield. Development of the fully disposable hypodermic needle was spurred on in the 1950s for several reasons. The Korean War created blood shortages and in response disposable, sterile syringes were developed for collecting blood. The widespread immunization against polio during the period required the development of a fully disposable <b>syringe</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Although {{more than}} 100 {{operative}} procedures {{have been described}} {{for the treatment of}} patellar instability, there is no single universally successful procedure. For the most patients with lateral patellar instability medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reefing is recommended.

In the presence of recurrent patellar instability,the quality and strength of MPFL tissue is often compromised and it disturbs patellar stability after MPFL reefing.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the risk factors}} of needle stick injuries (NSIs) sustained by undergraduate dental students and nurse students at the King&#x 0027;s College London (KCL) Dental Institute. Materials and methods: A retrospective study evaluated the incident reports relating to NSIs reported {{over a period of}} 2 years. Factors including the dental department, study year, and when the injury took place during administration of local anaesthesia (LA) and recapping conventional syringe or clearing work surface or during disposal. Results: This report showed that students are at the highest risk of NSIs at the fourth year of their 5 -year BDS course. About one-third of injuries were reported among this group of students followed by year 5 students (25 %). Oral surgery clinics were the major source of incident reporting when compared with other specialised dental clinics within the institute. The left hands of the students were the most frequently affected by such injuries and then the right hands of student dental nurses. The attempt of needle recapping of conventional syringes was the least reported mechanism of injuries and constituted only 15 % of the total injuries and mainly occurred in third year students. The most frequent injuries among student nurses were during disposal of the needle. Conclusion: Less NSIs occur when using safety syringes. A non-recapping policy with immediate disposal of either the conventional or safety <b>syringe</b> <b>systems</b> after injection would prevent all clearance-related NSIs sustained by nurses.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to present a case involving an iatrogenic extrusion of the medicament during endodontic treatment and a literature review of similar reports. The present case demonstrates severe tissue necrosis and other deleterious effects following the extrusion of CaOH 2 paste beyond root apex. A 21 -year old female was referred for endodontic treatment of her maxillary left first premolar. After completion of the canal preparation, root canals were filled by premixed CaOH 2 paste. In the second appointment, a gingival detachment and an irregular zone of necrosis adjacent to the tooth apex was observed. To treat this complication, a mucoperiosteal flap was raised and the extruded material and necrotic tissues were currettaged and the area sutured. The patient was prescribed antibiotics and followed up at 2 weeks, 6 months and 2 years. Two week follow up showed good soft tissue healing. Two years postoperatively, complete radiographic and clinical healing was observed. We can conclude that the application of CaOH 2 should be carried out with care and preferably applied free hand or with a lentulo spiral rather than in a pressure syringe...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a poster}} presentation. Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) is an {{advanced}} hybrid manufacturing technology, which enables the embedding of electronic components and interconnections within solid metal structures, {{due to the}} low temperature/high plastic flow encountered during ultrasonic bonding.

This work summarises the recent advances made towards the integration of UAM with printed electronics and other advanced manufacturing technologies for the encapsulation of conductive tracks between the interfaces of the welded foils. Two different approaches were followed: Screen printing was utilized in the first approach, for the deposition of an insulating polymer layer and silver-loaded conductive adhesive tracks on the surface of an aluminium substrate prepared with UAM. In the second approach, the aluminium foils were surface modified prior to welding, in order to selectively create an insulating ceramic layer directly onto the foil surface. These modified foils were bonded using UAM and a <b>syringe</b> <b>system</b> was used for the dispensing of the silver conductive tracks. The effectiveness and advantages of each of these two methodologies are illustrated and commented upon.

The control treatment was given neither ARG nor NCG. Gas production (GP) was recorded, and pH at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h was also determined. At 12 and 24 h, the measurements were also made for ammonia-nitrogen (N), volatile fatty acids (VFA) and microbial crude protein (MCP) yield on purine quantification basis. At 24 h, the proportion of ARG and NCG degradation in rumen fluid was 100. 0 and 17. 8 %, respectively. Gas production and the acetate to propionate ratio increased in groups treated with ARG and NCG, compared with the control (P< 0. 01). Ammonia nitrogen concentration was higher (P< 0. 01) in the ARG group than in the NCG and control groups. Microbial crude protein concentration diminished in ARG and NCG groups, in comparison with the control (P< 0. 01). In conclusion, the effects of ARG and NCG on rumen fermentation were numerically relatively similar. Rapid degradation of ARG in rumen is a nutritionally wasteful process.

40|$|METHODS: This {{literature}} review refers to studies and surveys conducted between 2006 and 2012 which support the growing acceptance of SCIg therapy among patients with PIDD. We researched clinical studies that looked at various populations of patients using IVIg and followed {{them through the}} switch to SCIg. Infections and site reactions were tracked {{as well as the}} percentages of the study populations who remained on SCIg therapy as opposed to returning to IVIg. RESULTS: Patient acceptance of SCIg therapy programs has improved signicantly since 2006. When rst introduced, clinical studies looking at patient preference for IVIg compared to SCIg showed 53 % preferred IVIg and only 33 % favored SCIg. The remaining 14 % had no preference. While infection rates were lower with SCIg, site reactions were prevalent, especially with new patients, though site reactions tended to diminish over time. This and the need for increased frequency of infusions led many who tried SCIg to revert back to IVIg for their medication. By 2008, patients reverting back to IVIg after trying SCIg had dropped to 22 %. A 2010 study showed 92 % of patients preferred SCIg over IVIg therapy. With other studies demonstrating that ancillary supplies have a large impact on the success of a SCIg infusions, careful management of patient complaints is essential. CONCLUSIONS: Since the FDA approval of Vivaglobin ® for subcutaneous infusion in 2006 and Hizentra ® in 2011, patient acceptance of this procedure has grown signicantly. Based on the FREEDOM 60 ® <b>Syringe</b> Infusion <b>System</b> being the infusion method of choice for this therapy in the United States (as shown in the Immune Deciency Foundation’s 2008 Patient Survey, where 67 % of those surveyed (290) stated they use the FREEDOM 60 ® for SCIg administration) and a 2011 Hizentra ® study which also conrmed that the FREEDOM 60 ® System is the most often used pump in the United States, it can be inferred that the use of the FREEDOM 60 ® for subcutaneous infusion of immunoglobulin has had a positive impact on patient conversion from IVIg to SCIg.

A PANDA ring is a modified optical add/drop filter, {{named after the}} well known Chinese bear. In principle, the molecule/drug is trapped by the force generated by different combinations of gradient fields and scattering photons within the PANDA ring. A nanomicro needle system can be formed by optical vortices in the liquid core waveguide which can be embedded on a chip, {{and can be used}} for long-term treatment. By using intense optical vortices, the required genes/molecules can be trapped and transported dynamically to the intended destinations via the nanomicro syringe, which is available for drug delivery to target tissues, in particular tumors. The advantage of the proposed system is that by confining the treatment area, the effect can be decreased. The use of different optical vortices for therapeutic efficiency is also discussed.

40|$|Purpose: Recently, point {{mutations}} in surface-exposed tyrosine residues {{have been shown}} to increase AAV transduction significantly. We examined the efficacy of conventional AAV 8 and next generation tyrosine-mutant AAV 8 vectors to deliver genes into corneal endothelium in vivo. Methods: The study, which used female C 57 BL/ 6 mice, was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee and experiments were performed in accordance with the tenets of the ARVO statement for the use of animals. Ketamine and Xylazine hydrochloride were administered for anesthesia. Two microliters of AAV 8 titer (~ 1010 vg/ml) was injected into the anterior chamber of the eye from four different clock-positions with the Hamilton Microinjection <b>Syringe</b> <b>System</b> under an operating microscope. Eyes were then washed with water and sponge-dried. Slit lamp microscopy was utilized for clinical eye exam. Stereomicroscopy and immunocytochemistry techniques measured the levels and location of transgene. Delivered-transgene expression was quantified with real-time PCR and western blot analyses. Results: Both, conventional and tyrosine-mutant AAV 8 vectors successfully transduced mouse corneal endothelium in vivo. Mutant AAV 8 showed significantly higher transgene delivery into corneal endothelium than the conventional AAV 8. Injections performed from 12 or 3 o'clock position showed highest targeted transgene delivery into corneal endothelium. Low-to-mild transgene delivery was also detected in the stroma.

PEM had the longest DT indicating the best cohesive stability of any of the foams produced (2. 92 s/cm). Other biomimetic model variables investigated included effect of vessel size, delayed injection and rate of plug formation (injection speed). When comparing the 4 and 10 mm vessel diameters, the DTs seen in the 10 mm vessel were higher than those observed for the 4 mm vessel, as the vein angle had been reduced to 5 ° to allow for foam plug formation. PCF foam performance was in the order RA > CO 2 :O 2 (35 : 65) ? CO 2 :O 2 (65 : 35) > CO 2; PEM had a longer DT than all PCFs (22. 10 s/cm) except that for RA made by DSS which was similar but more variable. The effect of delayed injection was also investigated and the DT for PEM remained the longest of all foams with the lowest percentage deviation with respect to the mean values, indicating a consistent foam performance. When considering rate of plug formation, PEM consistently produced the longest DTs and this was possible even at low plug expansion rates (mean 29. 5 mm/s, minimum 20. 9 mm/s). The developed vein model has therefore demonstrated that PEM consistently displays higher foam stability and cohesiveness when compared to PCFs, over a range of clinically-relevant operational variables...|$|E
30|$|Hydraulic {{injection}} {{was performed}} through a steel casing to a target openhole interval using a dual Teledyne ISCO <b>syringe</b> pump <b>system.</b> Injection well diameter and openhole fracturing interval diameter were approximately 10  mm and 6  mm, respectively. The injection fluid was an 80 -weight gear oil with an approximate viscosity of 120  cP. MISTRAS Group, Inc. acoustic emission data collection {{hardware and software}} were used throughout all acoustic material characterization and laboratory hydraulic fracture testing. A MISTRAS PCI- 2 - 8 system was used, which contained three PCI- 2 boards {{and a total of}} six possible signal inputs. High sensitivity wideband WSα piezoelectric transducers were used. Each sensor has operating frequency range of 100 – 1000  kHz and a resonance of 125  kHz. Custom AE data analysis software was built in MATLAB to process the large number of AE signals in {{a relatively short period of}} time for source characterization, moment tensor solutions, parametric hit data analysis and coalesced fracture location and orientation prediction (Hampton et al. 2018). This work will focus on the latter; coalesced fracture location and orientation prediction.|$|R
40|$|This study {{tested and}} {{optimized}} various methodologies to generate, sample and characterize GB test atmospheres in an inhalation chamber, particularly at low vapor levels. A <b>syringe</b> drive/spray atomization <b>system</b> produced GB vapor at lethal concentrations of 1 - 44 mg/m 3. A saturator cell {{was used to}} generate GB vapor at sub-lethal concentrations down to levels approaching the TLV-TWA of 0. 0001 mg/m 3. Both generation techniques demonstrated the ability to produce stable vapor concentrations over extended exposure periods for inhalation toxicology studies. The techniques employed for this study would {{lay the foundation for}} testing other chemical warfare agents, such as GF or VX...|$|R
40|$|A double-closured method {{introduced}} for Hungate tubes eliminates clamps {{or special}} racks {{to hold the}} rubber stoppers in place while the tubes are being processed. The system prevents stoppers from being dislodged by gas-producing anaerobes and keeps the stoppers sterile so that the closed system of transfer can be conveniently utilized. Open and closed systems for handling a gas-producing anaerobe were compared. Ten tubes containing Clostridium perfringens were opened; the organism was detected in the air by use of an impingement collector. The gloved hand of the operator also revealed the test organism. A similar trial with culture material removed by the closed <b>system</b> (<b>syringe</b> transfer) resulted in no detectable contamination of the environment...|$|R
