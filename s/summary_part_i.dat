40|$|<b>Summary.</b> In <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> of this paper, we derived {{a set of}} data tapers {{designed}} to minimize the spectral leakage of decaying sinusoids immersed in white noise. Multiplying a long-period seismic record by K of these tapers creates K time series. A decaying sinusoid is fit to these K time series in the frequency domain {{at a number of}} chosen frequencies by a least-squares procedure. The fit is tested at each frequency using a statistical F-test. In <b>Part</b> <b>I,</b> we demonstrated that the multiple-taper method is a more sensitive detector of decaying sinusoids than the conventional direct spectralestimate. In this paper, we present a number of extensions to the multiple-taper method. We explain how the technique can be modified to estimate the harmonic components of records containing gaps. We discuss how sinusoids at frequencies between FFT bin frequencies can be detected, and how this method can be combined with conventional multi-station stacking procedures.

40|$|Slotted-Wall Tunnels <b>Summary,</b> <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> of {{this report}} {{describes}} {{a study of the}} lift interference effect in slotted-wall wind tunnels performed by a pure resistance electrical analogue. Both steady and oscillatory flow are considered. Special techniques devised to represent the singular behaviour of a point wing and at the edges of each slot are discussed in detail. Comparisons are made with an exact solution based on an equivalent homogeneous boundary condition for steady flow. For oscillatory flow experimental results are presented which show how the magnitude of the interference upwash changes with the frequency of the oscillation. 1. Introduction, Many of the wind tunnels used for both subsonic and transonic investigations have partially open walls consisting either of longitudinal slots or circular perforations. The boundaries of the tunnel influence the flow around the model, and there are several distinct interference effects, such as blockage interference on the stream velocity, lift interference on the model incidence and shock wave reflections from the walls...|$|E

40|$|<b>Summary.</b> <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> is an {{introduction}} to an empirical and theoretical study of two-dimensional aerofoil flows which include a limited region of supersonic flow terminated by a shock wave. A brief review of theoretical studies {{of the problem is}} followed by a detailed analysis of the flow pattern and associated pressure distribution. A scheme for the analysis of measured pressure distributions is thus derived, and this is used in Part II of the present paper to construct a semi-empirical method for the estimation of pressure distributions. The implications of the results established by this analysis are discussed in relation to the development of transonic aerofoil flows. In Part III the results of an integral solution of the transonic flow equation are examined, and modified {{on the basis of the}} analysis of Part II. PART I INTRODUCTION AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS 1. 1. Introduction. Theoretical methods for the estimation of the two-dimensional inviscid flow about aerofoil sections have existed for many years. The incompressible flow about simple profiles can be calculated exactly, and useful approximate solutions for the compressible subsonic flow about geometrically defined profiles have been developed. However, in these compressible-flow method...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Anhedonia, {{the loss}} of pleasure, is highly {{prevalent}} in both clinical and non-clinical populations but far from fully understood. Anhedonia was recently reconceptualized into an impaired ability to pursue, experience, and learn about pleasure. Although plausible, a major caveat of this reconceptualization {{is that it is}} almost exclusively based on studies that use a nomothetic approach to knowledge (macro-level perspective), largely neglecting how altered reward function in anhedonia takes shape idiographically (micro-level perspective). This PhD thesis sheds the first light on altered reward function in anhedonia from a micro-level perspective. The perspective is provided by the use of recent technologies (e. g., smartphones) and Experience Sampling Methods (ESM). ESMs allow for reliable sampling of moment-to-moment experiences and holds considerable promise for improving the current understanding of anhedonia. This chapter is a <b>summary</b> of <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> of my thesis, in which we investigated anhedonic individuals´ ability to pursue pleasure (chapter 2), to experience pleasure (chapter 3), and to learn from pleasurable experiences (chapter 4) ...|$|R
40|$|Modern cosmological {{simulations}} {{predict that}} {{the first generation of}} stars formed with a mass scale around 100 M some 300 − 400 million years after the Big Bang. When the first stars reached the end of their lives, many of them might have died as energetic supernovae (SNe) that could have significantly impacted the early Universe via injecting large amounts of energy and metals into the primordial intergalactic medium (IGM). In this dissertation, I have studied the SNe from the first stars, using numerical simulations on powerful supercomputers. I use a new radiation hydrodynamics code, CASTRO, to model the physical processes behind the first SNe. I also simulate the cosmological impact of the first stars and their SNe by using cosmological simulations with GADGET. The goal of my dissertation is to provide {{a better understanding of the}} first SNe and their feedback to the early Universe, a study which will be facilitated by forthcoming telescopes. The thesis is divided into three parts: the first SNe, their impact, and <b>summary.</b> In <b>Part</b> <b>I,</b> I present the results from my SN simulations. I provide relevant backgroun...|$|R
40|$|During {{the four}} years of my Ph. D. thesis, I had the {{opportunity}} to gain experience in two separate fields of neurobiology. Accordingly, this thesis is divided into two parts. While the first part (chapter 2 on page 25) focuses on glial cell biology, the second section (chapter 3 on page 61) concentrates on the research of neural stern cells. <b>Summary</b> of <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> Nearly a century after Ram 6 n y Cajal's studies describing the cellular structures of the peripheral nervous system (Ram 6 n y Cajal, 1928), both molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to myelination are still poorly understood. The investigation of hereditary diseases of the peripheral nervous system has improved our clinical knowledge, but the change in the perception of the molecular basis was initiated with the identification of point mutations in the peripheral myelin protein (Pmp 22) gene in the natural mouse mutants Trembler (Tr) and Trembler-J (Tr-J) (Suter et al., 1992 a; 1992 b). The subsequent generation and analysis of animal models harboring mutations in genes involved in peripheral neuropathies in man has further improved our understanding of these diseases (for review see Berger et al., 2002).

40|$|<b>Summary.</b> [...] In <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> {{a review}} {{is made of}} {{helicopter}} performance after engine failure. The transition from powered operation to autorotation is discussed and a theoretical analysis of the motion is given for a single-rotor helicopter with blade-pitch control. The technique of landing from a steady autorotative glide is dealt with briefly; the possibility is indicated of making a safe landing before the transition to steady autorotation has been completed. Reference is also made {{to the case of}} engine failure so near the ground that a safe landing may be made by increasing the blade pitch to make immediate use of the rotor energy. In Part II, tests made to investigate the performance of a Hoverfly I in the transition to autorotation following power cut in level flight are described; particular attention is given to the minimum rotor speed attained and to the height lost during the transition. Tests were made to investigate the performance for immediate reduction of pitch only; the need for quick pitch reduction however is stressed because of the rapid fall-off in rotor speed following powercut at high pitch. <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> The Performance after Power Failure of...|$|R
40|$|When the {{collection}} of tax could be imperiled by going through the usual deficiency procedures, the IRS may make a jeopardy assessment or a termination assessment (hereinafter sometimes called “summary assessment”) and proceed immediately to collection. To prevent the misuse of this power, section 7429 provides affected taxpayers expedited administrative and judicial review. The IRS has made {{tens of thousands of}} jeopardy and termination assessments over the years, and there are hundreds of court decisions in litigated section 7429 cases. The unique nature of jeopardy and termination assessments makes section 7429 proceedings very different from typical tax litigation. This article addresses a significant difference – the extent to which taxpayers may be allowed discovery of the basis of the IRS’s <b>summary</b> assessment. <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> sets the context by describing jeopardy and termination assessments and section 7429 review. Part II examines a number of judicial decisions foundational to discovery incident to section 7429. Part III considers special factors that likely will incline a court to expand or contract discovery available to taxpayers in such cases. The conclusion that will emerge from these parts is that only limited discovery typically is permitted in section 7429 cases, although special factors may alter the permitted extent of discovery. This pattern deviates from the generally more liberal discovery usually available in federal district courts. Part IV asks whether such deviation is consistent with rules of civil procedure and concludes that it is...|$|R
40|$|This, the sixty-eighth {{edition of}} the Economic Survey of Latin America and the Caribbean, which {{corresponds}} to the year 2016, consists of three <b>parts.</b> <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> outlines the region’s economic performance in 2015 and analyses trends {{in the first half}} of 2016, as well as the outlook for the rest of the year. It examines the external and internal factors influencing the region’s economic performance and highlights some of the macroeconomic policy challenges that have arisen in an external context of weak growth and high levels of uncertainty. Part II analyses the challenges that the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean face at the domestic and international levels in mobilizing financing for development. On the domestic front, slower growth and tighter fiscal restrictions pose significant challenges for the mobilization of resources. Externally, the classification of many of the region’s countries in the middle-income category limits their access to concessional external financing or international support. Part III of this publication may be accessed on the web page of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (www. eclac. org).

40|$|As this Symposium illustrates, {{the recent}} {{application}} of molecular genetics to cellular neurobiology is gener-ating {{a great deal}} of excitement.

40|$|Includes bibliography. The 2014 {{edition of}} the Economic Survey of Latin America and the Caribbean {{consists}} of three <b>parts.</b> <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> considers the economic performance of {{the region in the}} first half-year as well as the outlook for the year as a whole, against the backdrop of a world economy marked by opportunities and setbacks. The causes of the modest economic growth forecast for the year are examined and attention is drawn to some of the challenges facing public policymakers. Part II discusses aspects of medium- and long-term economic development in Latin America and the Caribbean. The new external context (slower growth in the emerging economies, a sluggish performance by the developed countries, less buoyant commodity prices and more costly external financing) poses further challenges for economically and socially sustainable growth and development in the region. In the effort to define these challenges, emphasis is placed on the region’s heterogeneity and on the diverse structural issues and specific vulnerabilities that macroeconomic policies must address in each country. The drivers of growth in recent decades are analysed: it is pointed out that sweeping changes will be needed to underpin the new economically and socially sustainable growth and that this growth is contingent on significantly higher levels of investment and productivity. Part III contains the notes relating to the economic performance of the different countries of the region in 2013 and the first half of 2014, together with their respective statistical annexes, which present the main economic indicators of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.
