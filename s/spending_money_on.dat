The win pushed Tech to 11–2 on the season, while the Cardinals' loss ensured they ended the 2005 season with a 9–3 overall record. The game itself provided more than $14million in economic benefit to the Jacksonville area as Louisville and Virginia Tech fans flocked to the region, <b>spending</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> food, hotel rooms, transportation, and entertainment.|$|E

5|$|Rise of Mana is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game where the player takes control of two protagonists inhabiting a single body: the characters' genders and names can be customized prior to beginning the game. During gameplay, the character can switch between angelic and demonic forms: this enables the player to see thoughts in different non-player characters (NPCs), with each form showing {{different types of}} thought or prompting a different reaction from NPCs. The game uses a free-to-play gaming model: while the game can be downloaded and played for free, players {{have the option of}} <b>spending</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> in-game items. The characters' base is a room in a small village: in the room, players can check messages, and set their current equipment and weapons. A message board in the town provides access to social features. In the town, NPC-run shops enable the crafting of new weapons and equipment in exchange for in-game currency, along with the buying and selling of various in-game items.|$|E

30|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} has shown that individuals with more money are happier [40, 41], although this relationship is weaker than many people expect [42 – 44]. Recent studies in social and positive psychology suggest that how people <b>spend</b> their <b>money</b> may be at least as important as the amount of money they have [45]. More specifically, investing discretionary resources into life experiences rather than buying material possessions, seems to make people happier [46 – 48]. Moreover, both correlational and experimental studies have shown that people who <b>spend</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> others report more happiness [49]. For this reason, determining an individual’s purchasing style (e.g., whether the individual tends to <b>spend</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> life experiences or material items, or whether the individual tends to <b>spend</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> others) may be useful to infer life satisfaction and subjective happiness.|$|R

By 1901, the infrastructure development continued to trend growth to the south, first by the Plant System Railroads to the fledgling port of Tampa and then the Flagler railroad to the remote outpost of Miami. However, Tallahassee was firmly entrenched as capital and in that year the 1845 capitol building was expanded with two new wings, and a small dome.|$|E
25|$|Whilst the Bodleian Library, in {{its current}} incarnation, has a {{continuous}} history dating back to 1602, its roots date back even further. The first purpose-built library known to have existed in Oxford was founded in the fourteenth century under the will of Thomas Cobham, Bishop of Worcester (d. 1327). This small collection of chained books was situated above {{the north side of}} the University Church of St Mary the Virgin on the High Street. This collection continued to grow steadily, but when Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (brother of Henry V of England) donated a great collection of manuscripts between 1435 and 1437, the space was deemed insufficient and a larger building was required. A suitable room was finally built above the Divinity School, and completed in 1488. This room continues to be known as Duke Humfrey's Library. After 1488, the university stopped <b>spending</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the library's upkeep and acquisitions, and manuscripts began to go unreturned to the library.|$|E
25|$|Julian Zelizer (2000) {{has argued}} that fiscal {{conservatism}} was {{a key component of}} the New Deal. A fiscally conservative approach was supported by Wall Street and local investors and most of the business community; mainstream academic economists believed in it, as apparently did the majority of the public. Conservative southern Democrats, who favored balanced budgets and opposed new taxes, controlled Congress and its major committees. Even liberal Democrats at the time regarded balanced budgets as essential to economic stability in the long run, although they were more willing to accept short-term deficits. As Zelizer notes, public opinion polls consistently showed public opposition to deficits and debt. Throughout his terms, Roosevelt recruited fiscal conservatives to serve in his Administration, most notably Lewis Douglas the Director of Budget in 1933–1934, and Henry Morgenthau Jr., Secretary of the Treasury from 1934 to 1945. They defined policy in terms of budgetary cost and tax burdens rather than needs, rights, obligations, or political benefits. Personally the President embraced their fiscal conservatism. Politically, he realized that fiscal conservatism enjoyed a strong wide base of support among voters, leading Democrats, and businessmen. On the other hand, there was enormous pressure to act – and <b>spending</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> high visibility work programs with millions of paychecks a week.|$|E

500|$|In 1935, MacDonald stood down as Prime Minister, taking Baldwin's post as Lord President of the Council, and Baldwin became Prime Minister for {{the third}} time. Chamberlain {{remained}} at the Treasury, almost the only Cabinet member not to be moved in the subsequent reshuffle. Chamberlain was still spoken of as heir apparent, but feared being eclipsed by a younger man.

In its third year, The International allowed crowdfunding to add to its prize pool through an interactive, in-game app called a [...] "compendium".
