40|$|Mutations in the {{alkaline}} nuclease gene of {{herpes simplex}} type 1 (HSV- 1) (nuc mutations) induce almost wild-type levels of viral DNA; however, mutant viral yields are 0. 1 to 1 % of wild-type yields (L. Shao, L. Rapp, and S. Weller, Virology 195 : 146 - 162, 1993; R. Martinez, L. Shao, J. C. Bronstein, P. C. Weber, and S. Weller, Virology 215 : 152 - 164, 1996). nuc mutants are defective {{in one or}} more stages of genome maturation and appear to package DNA into aberrant or defective capsids which fail to egress from the nucleus of infected cells. In this study, we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to test the hypothesis that the defects in nuc mutants are due to the failure of the newly replicated viral DNA to be processed properly during DNA replication and/or recombination. Replicative intermediates of HSV- 1 DNA from both wild-type- and mutant-infected cells remain in the wells of pulsed-field gels, while free linear monomers are readily resolved. Digestion of this well DNA with restriction enzymes that cleave once in the viral genome releases discrete monomer DNA from wild-type virus-infected cells but not from nuc mutant-infected cells. We conclude that both wild-type and mutant DNAs exist in a complex, nonlinear form (possibly branched) during replication. The fact that discrete monomer-length DNA cannot be released from nuc DNA by a <b>single-cutting</b> enzyme suggests that this DNA is more branched than DNA which accumulates in cells infected with wild-type virus. The well DNA from cells infected with wild-type and nuc mutants contains XbaI fragments which result from genomic inversions, indicating that alkaline nuclease is not required for mediating recombination events within HSV DNA. Furthermore, nuc mutants are able to carry out DNA replication-mediated homologous recombination events between inverted repeats on plasmids as evaluated by using a quantitative transient recombination assay. Well DNA from both wild-type- and mutant-infected cells contains free U(L) termini but not free U(S) termini. Various models to explain the structure of replicating DNA are considered...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{differences}} in United States energy consumption and production has influenced {{the passing of}} legislation for biomass fuel production. To determine feasibility of energy crops for alternative fuels, {{research is needed to}} investigate dry matter yield over an extended harvest season; physical characteristics need to be described for potential harvesting problems; chemical characteristics described to identify selective harvest potential, optimal harvest timing, losses during harvest and storage; various harvest techniques investigated to identify potential cost savings; and impact of various storage techniques on quantity and quality of deliverable biomass. This study investigated the use of two sorghum varieties as a potential bioenergy feedstock where 20 ha were planted for three years. Standing crop samples were collected from August through January to document changes in dry matter yield, moisture, height, fiber content, proximate and ultimate analysis. The sorghum was cut and conditioned ? as a two-cutting ratoon or <b>single-cutting</b> ? using various mower-conditioners and windrow samples taken daily to determine best method of field drying, quantify dry matter loss and soil entrainment. Two storage methods were utilized ? baling with wrapping in a tubeline, and chopping and compressing in bag using a modified cotton module builder ? to determine best method of storage for reduced dry matter loss. The optimal time of harvest for maximum dry matter occurred with the November once-cut where 30 Mg ha^- 1 was documented, but comparable yields were observed with the two-cutting scenario. Fiber content increased with maturity, peaked, and declined, while ash content and moisture decreased with maturity. The achievement of 55 % moisture in January shows field curing to be necessary for transportation at any significant distance, but soil entrainment ? as measured by ash concentration ? was not found to be a significant problem after conditioning, multiple windrow inversions, and harvesting. The geometric mean length of particle was determined to be 1. 4 to 3. 7 times lower than nominal chop length, indicating potential cost savings in comminution. Dry matter loss estimates during storage proved difficult due to mobility of moisture throughout the packages, where losses were documented up to 40 %. Module packages tended to have lower dry matter and constituent losses than bales...|$|R
40|$|For this project, N-terminal and C-terminal peptide library fusions were designed,bconstructed, and {{screened}} {{in order}} to improve the repression achievable with a novel gene regulatory system. This system, based on the interaction between proteins and proteinbinding RNA aptamers, takes advantage of the reversible interaction between TetR and its RNA aptamer binding partner 5 - 1. 2 to modulate gene expression. With no tetracyclines present, TetR preferentially binds to aptamer 5 - 1. 2 in the mRNA of a gene of interest with low nanomolar affinity and represses translation. Tetracyclines such as aTc induce a conformation change in TetR, prevent TetR binding to aptamer 5 - 1. 2, and induce gene expression. Therefore, TetR binds aptamer 5 - 1. 2 in an aTc-dependent manner, allowing inducible control of gene expression through the TetR-aptamer system. Initial characterization showed a regulatory range of 78 % or approximately 5 fold in S. cerevisiae. The aim of this project is to improve repression levels achievable with the TetR-aptamer system by creating libraries of N-terminal and C-terminal peptide fusions to TetR and screening for increased repression in S. cerevisiae. The N-terminal and C-terminal library fusions were constructed from synthesized oligonucleotide fragments and a baseline TetR vector containing library insertions sites at both the N-terminal and C-terminal ends. The library fragments contain 20 random amino acids and a standard SSG linker peptide flanked by both <b>single-cutting</b> restriction enzyme sites and 40 bases of homology to the library insertion sites on the baseline TetR vector, allowing for construction by both restriction/ligation cloning in bacteria and yeast homologous recombination. Both libraries were constructed using restriction/ligation cloning after initial experiments determined optimized conditions for PCR, digest, purification, ligation, and electrocompetent bacterial transformation to achieve a maximum efficiency, fidelity, and purity. The N-terminal and C-terminal libraries produced have a combined diversity of 2. 5 x 105 variants. These library variants were screened using a plate-based assay with URA 3 as a reporter gene. A selection with 5 -fluoroorotic acid (5 -FOA) was performed to identify library variants with improved repression. Since 5 -FOA is a competitive inhibitor of URA 3, cells that have URA 3 expression cannot live on media containing 5 -FOA. Preliminary experiments determined that 0. 035 % 5 -FOA is the threshold for growth for the baseline(cont.) TetR-aptamer system. Library variants containing 5 - 1. 2 -URA 3 were grown on media containing a gradient of 5 -FOA concentrations between 0. 03 % and 0. 06 % and compared to baseline TetR growth. Thirty-one library variants grew at a 5 -FOA concentration greater than the baseline threshold for growth. These library hits underwent testing to further characterize their repression, inducibility, and library sequence. The 31 colony hits were streaked on discrete concentrations of 5 - FOA to determine colony-specific 5 -FOA thresholds and on uracil dropout media in the presence and absence of aTc to screen for preserved inducibility. Of the original 31 colonies, 25 passed both plate assays, growing on 0. 045 % 5 -FOA and in a Tc-dependent manner on uracil dropout media. These 25 colonies were sequenced and analyzed using MEME to detect any conserved motifs. Twenty of the 25 sequenced colonies contained correct and unique libraries, 3 with N-terminal libraries and 17 with C-terminal libraries. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal library sequences had significant motifs. For the Nterminal sequences, all three contained the same 14 nucleotide motif, and 16 of the 17 Cterminal sequences also contained a 21 nucleotide motif. However, the unbiased selection for improved TetR functionality likely returned hits that use multiple mechanisms of action to enhance repression. Therefore, out of a diverse library pool containing 2. 5 x 105 variants, 20 unique library variants conferred increased repression on the TetR-aptamer system while maintaining inducibility in the presence of tetracycline. by Jessica Karen Wong.

40|$|Malunion {{after long}} bone {{fracture}} {{results in an}} incorrect position of the distal bone segment. This misalignment may lead to reduced function of the limb, early osteoarthritis and chronic pain. An established treatment option is a corrective osteotomy. For complex malunions, a <b>single-cut</b> rotational osteotomy is sometimes preferred in cases of angular deformity in three dimensions. However, planning and performing this type of osteotomy is relatively complex. This report describes a computer-assisted method for 3 -D planning and realizing a <b>single-cut</b> rotational osteotomy with a patient-specific cutting guide for orienting the osteotomy and an angled jig for adjusting the rotation angle. The accuracy and reproducibility of the method is evaluated experimentally using plastic bones. In addition, complex rotational deformities are simulated by a computer to investigate the relation between deformity and correction parameters. The computed relation between deformity and correction parameters enables the surgeon to judge the feasibility of a <b>single-cut</b> rotational osteotomy. This appears possible for deformities combining axial misalignment with sufficient axial rotation. The proposed 3 -D method of preoperative planning and transfer with a patient-specific cutting guide and angled jig renders the osteotomy procedure easily applicable, accurate, reproducible, and is a good alternative for complex and expensive navigation system...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{direction}} of the obliquity of the cut for performing <b>single-cut</b> osteotomy to correct combined angular and rotational deformities is difficult to determine. The appropriate obliquity, i. e. whether clockwise or anticlockwise {{in relation to the}} perpendicular to the bone axis, is usually determined through trials using plastic bone models to imitate the deformity, or on bananas, on which different simulations can be made. This is very confusing and difficult. In this study, we propose a table, with entries for angular and rotational deformities and the affected side. The correct obliquity of the cut in relation to the perpendicular to the diaphyseal axis is directly indicated in the table. A step-by-step review of the preoperative planning of the <b>single-cut</b> osteotomy is also presented, with emphasis on the proposed contribution...|$|E

30|$|Depending on the {{complexity}} of the malunion, patients were treated with an open-wedge osteotomy or an oblique <b>single-cut</b> rotation osteotomy (OSCRO) [14]. Both osteotomy types were planned by using virtual or physical synthetic models of both radii and/or assisted by intra-operative use of patient-specific cutting guides and jigs (Fig.  2). In the latter method, the sterilised surgical guide was positioned at the specific bone surface and was fixated with Kirschner wires, using the planned fixation holes. In the case of an oblique <b>single-cut</b> rotation osteotomy (OSCRO), the guide was removed after the osteotomy and a stainless steel jig served to set the angle between the proximal and distal bone segment [14]. Rotational alignment was achieved by rotating the malunited distal bone segment over the planned angle. Regular plate and screw fixation was performed to maintain the position. Postoperative management varied from direct mobilisation to 2  weeks of plaster of Paris immobilisation.|$|E
30|$|The {{advantage}} of using an oblique <b>single-cut</b> rotation osteotomy is the correction of angular deformities {{in three dimensions}} while maintaining optimal bone contact. However, the method does not aim to correct translational displacements. Small rotational errors after corrective osteotomy of a diaphyseal malunion may scale to relatively large translational displacements at the distal articular level. This could partly explain the residual displacements in ulnoradial and volodorsal shifts.|$|E

To {{evaluate}} comparative aspiration flow {{performance and}} also vitrectomy operating time efficiency using a double-cutting open port vitreous cutting system incorporated in a two-dimensional cutting (TDC, DORC International) vitrectome design versus standard vitreous cutter. Methods.

A prospective single-centre clinical study evaluated duration of core vitrectomy in 80 patients with macular pucker undergoing 25 -gauge or 27 -gauge vitrectomy using either a TDC vitrectome at 16, 000 cuts per minute (cpm) or standard <b>single-cut</b> vitrectome, combined with a Valve Timing intelligence (VTi) pump system (EVA, DORC International).
