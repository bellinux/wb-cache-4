5|$|Earth has {{undergone}} periodic climate {{shifts in the}} past, including four major ice ages. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by interglacial periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface albedo, reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in greenhouse gases, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice age periods include {{the positions of the}} continents, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the <b>solar</b> <b>output,</b> and volcanism.|$|E
25|$|Sunspots {{number is}} {{correlated}} with the intensity of solar radiation over the period since 1979, when satellite measurements became available. The variation caused by the sunspot cycle to <b>solar</b> <b>output</b> is relatively small, {{on the order of}} 0.1% of the solar constant (a peak-to-trough range of 1.3W·m−2 compared with 1366W·m−2 for the average solar constant).|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} ice ages {{are not fully}} {{understood}} for either the large-scale ice age periods or the smaller {{ebb and flow of}} glacial–interglacial periods within an ice age. The consensus is that several factors are important: atmospheric composition, such as the concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane (the specific levels of the previously mentioned gases are now able to be seen with the new ice core samples from EPICA Dome C in Antarctica over the past 800,000 years) changes in the earth's orbit around the Sun known as Milankovitch cycles, the motion of tectonic plates resulting in changes in the relative location and amount of continental and oceanic crust on the earth's surface, which affect wind and ocean currents, variations in <b>solar</b> <b>output,</b> the orbital dynamics of the Earth–Moon system, the impact of relatively large meteorites and volcanism including eruptions of supervolcanoes.|$|E
40|$|The many {{different}} aspects of solar terrestrial physics are summarized. The possible influence of variations in the <b>solar</b> <b>outputs</b> on the terrestrial climate, and the role for SCADM in such studies is emphasized. The use of SCADM to {{provide detailed information on}} variations in the <b>solar</b> <b>outputs</b> over a sizeable fraction of the solar cycle, and on the physics of the convection layer of the Sun is discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>outputs</b> {{during the}} current solar minimum are setting record low values for the space age. Evidence is here {{reviewed}} that {{this is part of}} a decline in solar activity from a grand solar maximum and that the Sun has returned to a state that last prevailed in 1924. Recent research into what this means, and does not mean, for climate change is reviewed...|$|R
50|$|Other {{factors that}} affect <b>solar</b> power <b>output</b> include the opacity of the Martian {{atmosphere}} and Martian seasonal changes.|$|R
25|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>output</b> also varies on shorter time scales, {{including}} the 11-year solar cycle and longer-term modulations. Solar intensity variations possibly {{as a result}} of the Wolf, Spörer and Maunder Minimum are considered to have been influential in triggering the Little Ice Age, and some of the warming observed from 1900 to 1950. The cyclical nature of the Sun's energy output is not yet fully understood; it differs from the very slow change that is happening within the Sun as it ages and evolves. Research indicates that solar variability has had effects {{including the}} Maunder minimum from 1645 to 1715 A.D., part of the Little Ice Age from 1550 to 1850 A.D. that was marked by relative cooling and greater glacier extent than the centuries before and afterward. Some studies point toward solar radiation increases from cyclical sunspot activity affecting global warming, and climate may be influenced by the sum of all effects (solar variation, anthropogenic radiative forcings, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Solar {{power is}} more {{predictable}} than wind power and less variable – {{while there is}} never any solar power available during the night, {{and there is a}} reduction in winter, the only unknown factors in predicting <b>solar</b> <b>output</b> each day is cloud cover, frost and snow. Many days in a row in some locations are relatively cloud free, just as many days in a row in either the same or other locations are overcast – leading to relatively high predictability. Wind comes from the uneven heating of the earth's surface, and can provide about 1% of the potential energy that is available from solar power. 86,000 TW of solar energy reaches the surface of the world vs. 870 TW in all of the world's winds. Total world demand is roughly 12 TW, many times less than the amount that could be generated from potential wind and solar resources. From 40 to 85 TW could be provided from wind and about 580 TW from solar.|$|E
500|$|However, {{examination}} of Archaean sediments appears {{inconsistent with the}} hypothesis of high greenhouse concentrations. Instead, the moderate temperature range {{may be explained by}} a lower surface albedo brought about by less continental area and the [...] "lack of biologically induced cloud condensation nuclei". This would have led to increased absorption of solar energy, thereby compensating for the lower <b>solar</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
30|$|Our result {{shows that}} solar protons have not {{decreased}} the <b>solar</b> cell <b>output</b> of the Akebono satellite, but solar protons are generally {{known to be}} a major cause of solar cell degradation. As an example, the Japanese CS satellite on GEO experienced a step-like decrease of <b>solar</b> cell <b>output</b> for occasions of large solar proton events. A large decrease took place in October 1989, when the Akebono satellite has been also in orbit. We investigated the <b>solar</b> cell <b>output</b> variation of the Akebono satellite in October 1989, but found no evident decrease. Probably due to the low altitude of Akebono orbit, the solar cells are not significantly affected by solar protons but are more severely damaged by trapped proton radiation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Solar</b> energy <b>output</b> {{is limited}} by weather and can be less {{effective}} if it is cloudy, wet, or winter.|$|R
30|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{the data of}} the <b>solar</b> cell <b>output</b> current between 1989 and 1992 in this study. We still have the Akebono data up to the present. From SAMPEX observation, Looper et al. (2005) reported that the proton radiation belt showed another drastic change in 2003. Although we need to identify and remove other variation components carefully from the <b>solar</b> cell <b>output</b> current, {{it may be possible}} to expand our analysis to later years to look for other variations of the proton radiation belt.|$|R
2500|$|In 2003, Baliunas and {{aerospace}} engineer Willie Soon published a review paper on historical climatology in Climate Research, which concluded that [...] "the 20th century {{is probably not}} the warmest nor a uniquely extreme climatic period of the last millennium." [...] With Soon, Baliunas investigated the correlation between solar variability and temperatures of the Earth's atmosphere. When there are more sunspots, the total <b>solar</b> <b>output</b> increases, and when there are fewer sunspots, it decreases. Soon and Baliunas attribute the Medieval warm period to such an increase in <b>solar</b> <b>output,</b> and believe that decreases in <b>solar</b> <b>output</b> led to the Little Ice Age, a period of cooling from which the earth has been recovering since 1890.|$|E
2500|$|Forcing {{mechanisms}} can {{be either}} [...] "internal" [...] or [...] "external". Internal forcing mechanisms are natural processes within the climate system itself (e.g., the thermohaline circulation). External forcing mechanisms {{can be either}} natural (e.g., changes in <b>solar</b> <b>output,</b> the earth's orbit, volcano eruptions) or anthropogenic (e.g. increased {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} and dust).|$|E
2500|$|Intermittency {{inherently}} affects solar energy, as {{the production}} of electricity from solar sources depends {{on the amount of}} sunlight at a given place and time. [...] <b>Solar</b> <b>output</b> varies throughout the day and through the seasons, and is affected by dust, cloud cover, frost or snow. [...] Many of the seasonal factors are fairly predictable, and some solar thermal systems make use of heat storage to produce grid power for a full day.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{integrated}} battery charger/discharger converter for {{a standardized}} battery module is proposed. Instead of using separate charger and discharger converters, it integrates these two converters {{into a single}} converter {{in order to minimize}} the size. The integrated charger/discharger converter not only regulates the <b>solar</b> array <b>output</b> power including the peak power tracking capability but also controls the battery charging/discharging current depending on the <b>solar</b> array <b>output</b> power and the load power.

2500|$|Battery systems {{connected}} to large solid-state converters {{have been used}} to stabilize power distribution networks. Some grid batteries are co-located with renewable energy plants, either to smooth the power supplied by the intermittent wind or <b>solar</b> <b>output,</b> or to shift the power output into other hours of the day when the renewable plant cannot produce power directly (see Installation examples). These hybrid systems (generation + storage) can either alleviate the pressure on the grid when connecting renewable of [...] be used to reach self-sufficiency and work [...] "off-the-grid" [...] (see Stand-alone power system).|$|E
50|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>output</b> is nearly, but not quite, constant. Variations {{in total}} solar {{irradiance}} (TSI) {{were small and}} difficult to detect accurately with technology available before the satellite era (+/- 2% in 1954).

5000|$|In the paper, Soon, Baliunas, {{and their}} co-authors {{investigated}} {{the correlation between}} solar variation and temperatures of the Earth's atmosphere.

50|$|While The Year Without a Summer, in 1816, {{occurred}} during the Dalton Minimum, the prime reason for that year's cool temperatures was the highly explosive eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia, {{which was one of}} the two largest eruptions in the past 2000 years. One must also consider that the rise in volcanism may have been triggered by lower levels of <b>solar</b> <b>output</b> as there is a weak but statistically significant link between decreased <b>solar</b> <b>output</b> and an increase in volcanism.|$|E

30|$|Finally, MODAM {{facilitates}} model comparisons {{and validation}} of behavioural sub models. Indeed, {{data can be}} used to set the parameters of sub models, that some behaviours use to inform their decisions. As an example, our implementation of solar PV behaviours can be informed by historical <b>solar</b> PV <b>output</b> data or weather data, see Figure  4. The weather data is used to populate a weather-driven model of expected electrical <b>output</b> of <b>solar</b> PV subject to weather with the passage of clouds, while the historical solar PV data simply gives the electrical <b>output</b> of specific <b>solar</b> PVs recorded over a period of time. Because these two approaches require different data input, two data readers were written to be used by each method. When the user chooses their preferred behaviour method, the required data provider will then be called upon. This has the advantage of extending the model, but also offers model comparison and validation of the behavioural sub models. Indeed, the weather-driven <b>solar</b> PV <b>output</b> model could be validated by comparing its output with the actual observations of <b>solar</b> PV <b>output.</b> The dynamic agent composition therefore has the additional benefit that validation of models can be done easily by setting two simulations and simply changing the datasets and data providers, and comparing their outputs.|$|R
