As there was little information available to explain the difference in <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use rates, the main aim {{of this study was to}} investigate why there is a lower rate of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use on urban roads. A number of perceptions, beliefs and expectancies about <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use were examined to identify variables that discriminated between <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> users and non-users on urban roads. The subjects were 398 undergraduate students (aged 17 - 47) studying at the University of Girona, Spain. On the urban roads reported discomfort from using the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> was higher, while perceptions of risk (for non-users), safety perceptions (for those using a <b>seat</b> <b>belt),</b> beliefs about the seriousness of a crash or the effectiveness of the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> were all lower than on the highway. Perceptions of safety, discomfort, and social influence predicted <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use on urban roads. Concern about being lined for not using a <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> did not predict <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. The results of this research suggest that in order to increase <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use on urban roads, the issue of discomfort must be addressed. In addition, prevention campaigns should include information about the effectiveness of the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> in preventing/reducing injuries or deaths on urban roads.

Ten taverns in two cities served as sites. Data were collected on the nighttime <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use of tavern patrons and daytime citywide <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. Results indicated that the intervention increased nighttime <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use by tavern patrons. Daytime <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use increased in one city and remained at a high level in the other following the intervention. Because previous research has shown that tavern patrons are overrepresented in the impaired driving population, and that <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use decreases the likelihood of serious injury or death, results of this study suggest that enforcement of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use could reduce casualties resulting from impaired driving...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> laws and public {{education}} campaigns on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use are assessed {{on the basis of}} observational or self-reported data on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. Previous studies focusing on front seat occupants have shown that self-reports indicate a greater <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage than observational findings. Whether this over-reporting in self reports applies to rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage, and to what extent, have yet to be investigated. We aimed to evaluate the over-reporting factor for rear seat passengers and whether this varies by gender and under different compulsory <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use conditions. Methods The study was conducted in the Veneto Region, an area in the North-East of Italy with a population of 4. 7 million. The prevalence of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use among rear seat passengers was determined by means of a cross-sectional self-report survey and an observational study. Both investigations were performed in two time periods: in 2003, when rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use was not enforced by primary legislation, and in 2005, after rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use had become compulsory (June 2003). Overall, 8138 observations and 7902 interviews were recorded. Gender differences in the prevalence of rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use were examined using the chi-square test. The over-reporting factor, defined as the ratio of the self-reported to the observed prevalence of rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use, was calculated by gender before and after the rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> legislation came into effect. Results Among rear seat passengers, self-reported rates were always higher than the observational findings, with an overall over-reporting factor of 1. 4. We registered no statistically significant changes over time in the over-reporting factor, nor any major differences between genders. Conclusion Self-reported <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage by rear passengers represents an efficient alternative to observational studies for tracking changes in actual behavior, although the reported figures need to be adjusted using an appropriate over-reporting factor in order to gain an idea of genuine <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. </p...|$|R
5|$|Non-use of <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> is a {{significant}} risk factor. According to Col. Tom Butler, chief of the Montana Highway Patrol, preliminary 2015 data indicated that 178 of the 224 vehicle occupant fatalities were of individuals not wearing <b>seat</b> <b>belts.</b> The fine in Montana for not wearing a seat belt in 2015 was $20. Although speed limits increased from 75mph to 80mph on rural interstates that year, the biggest statewide increase in both crashes and deaths occurred on secondary roads. Forty-three people died on Montana two-lane roads outside of towns that are neither U.S. or state highways.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} Selective Traffic Enforcement Programs (STEPs) on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use and motor vehicle {{accident}} casualties is evaluated. The following research questions are addressed: (a) Will <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use 2 years after a STEP be above the pre-STEP level? (b) Will repeated STEPs {{be as effective as}} an initial STEP in increasing <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use? (c) Does the increase in <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use induced by a STEP result in a reduction of accident casualties? A series of six <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use surveys (N = 32, 660) was conducted at the roadside in the Ottawa area where three STEPs were implemented during a 12 -month period, and in a control community. Archival data were used to examine the impact of the STEPs on accident casualties. It was found that <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use 2 years after an initial STEP was still significantly (p <. 001) above baseline usage, that three subsequent STEPs signif-icantly (p <. 001) increased <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use from 66 % to 84 %, and that driver casualties declined by 14 % subsequent to the STEPs. Periodic STEPs are effective in affecting long-term increases in <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use and consequently reducing traffic accident casualties. In Canada, compulsory <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use leg-islation has increased <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> wearing in legislated provinces and hence has resulted in some reduction of occupant casualties (Jonah & Lawson, 1984). However, even in legislated jurisdictions, <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use is only in the 60 % range (Arora, 1984). A number of evaluations of Selective Traffic Enforcement Programs have demonstrated that these pro-grams are effective in achieving high levels of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> wearing in legislated jurisdiction...|$|R

5|$|Superman the Ride has {{undergone}} numerous safety upgrades. After the 2001 incident, the PVC airlines were replaced with steel reinforced air hoses {{to prevent a}} similar accident from occurring. After the 2004 incident, metal bars were installed {{on both sides of}} the “T-bar” restraint, encasing the rider's legs. Shin restraints were added to the lower portion of the restraint, preventing riders’ feet from leaving the car. In addition, all of the <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> on both 36-passenger trains were replaced with ones at a consistent length, as well as a “go or no go” belt for each seat and “T-bar” restraint. The “go or no go” belt ensured the “T-bar” restraint was in an effective position before leaving the station. During the 2009 rebranding, new trains were deployed with new restraints added. The new lapbars eliminated the center pole, leaving only the exterior poles. New <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> provided more strength and were less likely to come undone unintentionally.|$|E

40|$|Backgrounds and Objectives: Using <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> has a {{considerable}} role in reducing human damage. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare trend of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use rate during 4 years, from 2007 to 2010, in Golestan province (northern Iran). Materials and Methods: This was a population-based cross-sectional study that enrolled 3999 subjects aged 15 - 65 years during four years (2007 = 1000 cases, 2008 = 1000 cases, 2009 = 999 cases and 2010 = 1000 cases) using stratified cluster sampling. Interviewers recorded the data using a multidimensional questionnaire including anthropometric indexes. Using <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> in the case of sitting in the front seat of car (as a driver or passenger) of all samples was asked. SPSS 16. 0 software was used for statistical data analysis. Results: The rate of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use in the years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were 71 %, 69. 8 %, 74. 5 and 86. 4 %, respectively. <b>Seat</b> <b>belt</b> use during the four years increased up to 15. 4 %. Statistical differences among four years was significant (P< 0. 01). The increasing <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use rate was 19 % and 14. 9 % in urban and rural areas, respectively. The <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use rate was higher in subjects with = 35 years old people in proportion to 35 = years old people (17. 85 % versus 14. 3 %). During the latest year of study, using <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> was about 14. 8 % higher in men comparing with women (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Using <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> increased up to 3. 9 % per year and the trend in the rural areas was lower than in the urban areas. <b>Seat</b> <b>belt</b> used in men more than women. Using <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> and its growing trend, will help in reducing mortality caused by accidents in Iran. Â© IDOSI Publications, 2012...|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the Congressional action, NHTSA once again amended FMVSS 208, requiring vehicles to come with a <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminder system that gives an audible signal for 4 to 8 seconds and a warning light for at least 60 seconds after the ignition is turned on if the driver's <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> is not fastened. This is called a <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminder (SBR) system. In the mid-1990s, an insurance company from Sweden called Folksam worked with Saab and Ford to determine the requirements for the most efficient <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminder. One characteristic of the optimal SBR, according to the research, is that the audible warning becomes increasingly penetrating the longer the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> remains unfastened.|$|R

5|$|Since a {{major cause}} of TBI are vehicle accidents, their {{prevention}} or the amelioration of their consequences can both reduce the incidence and gravity of TBI. In accidents, damage can be reduced by use of <b>seat</b> <b>belts,</b> child safety seats and motorcycle helmets, and presence of roll bars and airbags. Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes. In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include speed limits, seat belt and helmet laws, and road engineering practices.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{increase}} teen <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> {{use among}} drivers at a rural high school by implementing the Drive Alive Pilot Program (DAPP), a theory-driven intervention built on highway safety best practices. Methods: The first {{component of the}} program was 20 observational teen <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> surveys conducted by volunteer students in a high school parking lot over a 38 -month period before and after the month-long intervention. The survey results were published in the newspaper. The second component was the use of incentives, such as gift cards, to promote teen <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. The third component involved disincentives, such as increased police patrol and school policies. The fourth component was a programmatic intervention that focused on education and media coverage of the DAPP program. Results: Eleven pre-intervention surveys and nine post-intervention surveys were conducted before and after the intervention. The pre- and post-intervention <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage showed significant differences (p< 0. 0001). The average pre-intervention <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage rate was 51. 2 %, while the average post-intervention rate was 74. 5 %. This represents a percentage point increase of 23. 3 in <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use after the DAPP intervention. Conclusion: Based on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> observational surveys, the DAPP was effective in increasing <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use among rural high school teenagers.
