5000|$|In 1914, Donald F. Jones {{arrived at}} the station {{at the age of}} twenty-five, and began to build upon the work of East and Hayes. By 1917, he had {{published}} his theory of “heterosis,” which explained the increased vigor and yield observed in hybrid maize. The same year, he created a double-cross hybrid corn by breeding two separate hybrid individuals. This new cross descended from four distinct inbred lines, and was even more vigorous than either of its parents. However, like the <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrid,</b> this improvement was lost over subsequent generations of inbreeding. Jones published his double-cross method in 1919, and began actively promoting the technique as a means to improve corn production nationally: “it is something that may easily be taken up by seedsmen; in fact, {{it is the first time}} in agricultural history that a seedsman is enabled to gain full benefit from a desirable origination of his own… The utilization of first generation hybrids enables to originator to keep the parental types and give out only the crossed seeds, which are less valuable for continued propagation.” ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract ? The {{objective}} of this work was to distinguish the parental source of alleles in heterozygous progeny using semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in maize endosperm. Endosperms derived from direct and reciprocal <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> between maize inbred lines L 3 and L 1113 - 01 were genotyped by semiquantitative PCR methodology (SQ-PCR) using fluorescent microsatellite primers. The amplification products were evaluated by the ratios of fluorescence intensity (RFI), calculated between the peaks corresponding to the alleles derived from each parental line. Based on the statistically significant contrast between RFI mean values of direct and reciprocal <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrids,</b> {{it was possible to}} distinguish the number of alleles received from each parental line and, ultimately, to determine the origin of the alleles of each cross. Thus, endosperm genotyping using SQ-PCR is a promising strategy to map QTL in maize outbred populations. 200...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the combining ability of popcorn lines and hybrids with favorable traits for baby corn production, using lines extracted from the major genotypes of the Brazilian germplasm.

40|$|ABSTRACT- A {{three-phase}} {{study was}} led by CIMMYT during 1996 - 99 to assess the usefulness of modified sin-gle-cross hybrids to accelerate the adoption of maize hy-brids by farmers in developing countries. During Phase I, we evaluated and selected elite, conventional, <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrids.</b> Based on the information from Phase I, different versions of related crosses between sister lines used in the elite single crosses identified in Phase I were formed and tested during Phase II. Finally, in Phase III we used the results of Phase II to form different versions of modi-fied single crosses and tested them with the original con-ventional single crosses. From Phase I, 13 conventional <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> selected averaged 11. 2 t ha- 1 and the best three averaged 11. 9 t ha- 1, outyielding the best check, A- 7545 (11. 5 t ha- 1). From Phase II, the 18 related crosses averaged 6. 7 t ha- 1, while the 25 lines per se in-volved in these crosses yielded 4. 5 t ha- 1, an average dif-ference of 50 %. The related crosses selected expressed a 37 % high parent heterosis on average. Finally, in Phase III we found non-significant differences in yield between the original conventional single crosses and the correspon-ding modified single crosses (both averaged 9. 6 t ha- 1). These results confirm that modified single crosses can produce grain yields comparable to their corresponding conventional crosses. Thus, modified <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> represent a possible option for exploiting the high yield performance of elite conventional single crosses, where this type of cultivars cannot be adopted by resource-poor farmers in developing countries because expensive price of certified seed...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate four maize testers for identification of superior inbreed lines in testcross. The four testers evaluated are cultivars with narrow or wide genetic base (<b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> and open pollinated varieties) and two kernel types (flint or dent). SynD and SynF testers are open pollinated varieties with dent and flint kernels, respectively, and FSH and DSH testers are <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> with flint and dent kernels, respectively.

The breakdown of additive variance into intrapopulation and interpopulation additive deviations (?? 2 ??) and the covariance between these and their intrapopulation additive effects (CovAr) found predominance of the dominance effect for unhusked ear weight.

50|$|Corn {{heterosis}} was famously {{demonstrated in}} the early 20th century by George H. Shull and Edward M. East after hybrid corn was invented by Dr. William James Beal of Michigan State University based on work begun in 1879 {{at the urging of}} Charles Darwin. Dr. Beal's work led to the first published account of a field experiment demonstrating hybrid vigor in corn, by Eugene Davenport and Perry Holden, 1881. These various pioneers of botany and related fields showed that crosses of inbred lines made from a Southern dent and a Northern flint, respectively, showed substantial heterosis and outyielded conventional cultivars of that era. However, at that time such hybrids could not be economically made on a large scale for use by farmers. Donald F. Jones at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, New Haven invented the first practical method of producing a high-yielding hybrid maize in 1914-1917. Jones' method produced a double-cross hybrid, which requires two crossing steps working from four distinct original inbred lines. Later work by corn breeders produced inbred lines with sufficient vigor for practical production of a commercial hybrid in a single step, the <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrids.</b> <b>Single-cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> are made from just two original parent inbreds. They are generally more vigorous and also more uniform than the earlier double-cross hybrids. The process of creating these hybrids often involves detasseling.|$|R

40|$|Breeders have {{successfully}} improved maize (Zea mays L.) grain yield for {{the conditions of}} the US corn-belt over the past 80 years, with the past 50 years utilizing <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrids.</b> Long-term improvement for grain yield under water-limited conditions has also been reported. Grain yield under water-limited conditions depends on water use, water use efficiency, and harvest index. It has been hypothesized that long-term genetic gain for yield could be due, in part, to increased water capture from the soil. This hypothesis was tested using a set of elite <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> that were released by DuPont Pioneer between 1963 and 2009. Eighteen hybrids were grown in the field during 2010 and 2011 growing seasons at Woodland, CA, USA. Crops grew predominantly on stored soil water and drought stress increased as the season progressed. Soil water content was measured to 300 cm depth throughout the growing season. Significant water extraction occurred to a depth of 240 - 300 cm and seasonal water use was calculated from the change in soil water over this rooting zone. Grain yield increased significantly with year of commercialization, but no such trend was observed for total water extraction. Therefore, the measured genetic gain for yield for the period represented by this set of hybrids must be related to either increased efficiency of water use or increased carbon partitioning to the grain, rather than increased soil water uptake...|$|R

Nine elite <b>single-cross</b> (SC) <b>hybrids</b> and their 36 double-crosses (DC) were evaluated in western Nebraska, eastern Wyoming, and northeastern Colorado in 1998 and 1999 under different water regimes to assess differences in yield and drought-related characteristics among them, to estimate combining ability {{effects of these}} characteristics, to uncover patterns of GE interaction, and to assess the potential of indirect selection for grain yield in dryland environments based on selection under irrigated conditions. <b>Single-cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> were superior in yield to DC hybrids across all water regimes. On average, DC hybrids yielded 11 % less than SC hybrids. However, the difference in yield could not be explained by differences in drought-related characteristics between SC and DC hybrids. A diallel study showed that grain yield was largely controlled by non-additive gene action, whereas drought-related characteristics were under control of additive gene action. Across all water regimes, specific combining ability (SCA) effects were more stable than general combining ability (GCA) effects. A strong association in SCA effects between yield and drought-related characteristics was observed, even under irrigated conditions. <b>Single-cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> showed a superior stability across all environments, and DC hybrids showed a better stability across harsh environments.

The study suggested that screening among elite SC hybrids under irrigated environments in the area for low susceptibility to drought stress and earliness might increase the productivity of hybrid maize in the target area. Alternatively, a selection based on SCA effects for yield, which can be applied under irrigated conditions, might indirectly increase drought tolerance in hybrid maize. ...|$|R

40|$|Genótipos de milho com variabilidade genética contrastante apresentam potenciais produtivos diferentes. Isso pode ser causado, pelo menos em parte, por diferenças morfológicas no sistema radicular e nos parâmetros cinéticos de absorção de nutrientes. Este trabalho objetivou quantificar esses parâmetros em três cultivares de milho. Foram comparados um híbrido simples (HS), um híbrido duplo (HD) e uma variedade de polinização aberta (VPA). Determinaram-se os parâmetros de absorção (influxo máximo, Imax, constante de Michalies-Menten, Km, e concentração na solução onde a absorção cessa, Cmin) para N, P, K, Ca e Mg, além de atributos morfológicos radiculares, em experimentos efetuados em câmara de crescimento, com solução nutritiva. A morfologia das raízes variou pouco entre os genótipos, provavelmente por causa do cultivo das plantas em meio líquido. As diferenças entre genótipos quanto aos parâmetros cinéticos de absorção dependeram do nutriente. O Imax diferiu entre os cultivares para P; o Km, para N e P, e o Cmin, para N e K. A VPA, por apresentar maior variabilidade genética, deveria apresentar menores valores para Km e Cmin do que os híbridos. Contudo, isso só aconteceu para P em relação ao Km. O HS, por apresentar maior potencial produtivo, deveria expressar os maiores valores para Imax, mas isso não ocorreu com nenhum dos macronutrientes avaliados. Portanto, a absorção de nutrientes não parece ser um fator determinante nas diferenças de rendimento de grãos entre genótipos de milho com bases genéticas contrastantes.

Morphological root attributes were also measured in growth chamber experiments carried out with nutrient solutions. Root morphology showed little variation among maize genotypes. Differences among genotypes regarding the uptake kinetics depended on the nutrient: Imax differed among genotypes for P, the Km for N and P, and Cmin for N and K. The open-pollinated variety was expected to present lower Km and Cmin values than the hybrids due to its broader genetic variability. Nevertheless, this was only observed for P in relation to Km.

Qualitative and quantitative changes were observed in fungal compositions, as well as preferential associations between symbiotic partners. Analysis of AMF diversity revealed the presence of 12 species, with Scutellospora calospora and Entrophospora colombiana being the most abundant in all treatments. The species Acaulospora longula, Glomus etunicatum, Glomus macrocarpum, and Gigaspora margarita exhibited preferential associations with certain genotypes. COL and GY differed among inbred lines and <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> and the significant correlations between COL and the DW and GY showed positive interactions between the plants and AMF. There was no correlation between heterosis for GY and heterosis for colonization. These <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> HS 83 × E 3 and D 3 × F 5 exhibited high GY, evidencing a productivity potential for the low technological condition used. </p...|$|R

This study assessed 128 maize genotypes in the agricultural frontier region of the State of Maranhão, between 2008 and 2009. The experiment was arranged in a lattice design with two replications. The genotypes were evaluated for grain yield in a mixed model, with fixed intercept and experimental effects. The random effects were genotype, genetic class (single-, double or triple-cross hybrid and variety), and incomplete block/replication/ environment.

40|$|The {{pearl millet}} (Pennisetum glaucum) parental line ICM 423 (PI 572306), {{released}} in 1988, is a downy mildew (Sclerospora graminicola) resistant restorer {{line of a}} <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrid</b> cultivar, ICMH 423. ICMP 423 {{was derived from the}} first cycle of the ICRISAT Early Composite which was constituted by random mating of 194 geographically diverse lines, mostly of India origin, that flowered in < 45 days from sowing at Patancheru during the 1973 rainy season. Selfed plants were advanced by bulking and a number of cycles of selection for phenotypic similarity and resistance to downy mildew were conducted. Some 1570 progenies with resistance to downy mildew were allowed to random mate. Seeds from the random mating were bulked to form ICMP 143. ICMP 143 is an elite restorer line with mean grain yield of 1750 kg/ha, medium height (147 cm) and a flowering time of 49 to 57 days from sowing. It produces 3 - 7 tillers/plant and has a 1000 -grain weight of 7. 5 g. In 11 disease nurseries in India and western Africa, it had higher levels of resistance to downy mildew than the resistant standard P 7 - 4 (mean and ranges of 4 % and 0 to 23 % in ICMP 423 and 7 % and 0 to 49 % in P 7 - 4) ...|$|E
40|$|Most maize (Zea mays L.) crosses in Tropical regions use the heterotic {{pattern of}} Tupeno dent and Caribbean flint.

Related inbred lines are used in either double or three-way hybrids with other unrelated lines to develop superior hybrids. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the combining ability among 11 related inbred lines from a Tuxpeno population. The 11 inbred lines were crossed in a diallel series and were evaluated at six locations. A combinig ability analysis was made for grain yeild. The average yield across environments for the 55 single (44. 8 q/ha) was not comparable to that of the <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrid</b> (56. 5 q/ha), induced as check. General combining ability (GCA) effects and specific combining ability (SCA) effects were highly significant (P < 0. 01). Variation due to GCA, however, accounted for 68 % of the variation among crosses. Indicating that additive genetic effects were more important than nonadditive effects. Highly significantly positive GCA effects were observed for lines 6 (2. 44 q/ha) and 7 (6. 40 q/ha) and highly significantly negative GCA effects for lines 5 (1. 63 q/ha), 10 (2. 64 q/ha), and 11 (4, 01 q/ha). Significantly positive SCA effects were observed with line 4 x line 11, line 5 x line 9, and line 5 x 11 crosses. Lines 6 and 7 may have potential use as parents for three-way or double-cross hybrids. 199...|$|E
40|$|Increasing grain protein {{concentration}} in maize (Zea mays L.) {{has not been}} a major focus of most breeding programs, which mainly focus on yield, maturity, and resistance to stress. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of three cycles of mass selection to improve simultaneously yield and grain protein in the maize population GR-OP- 319, derived from the F- 2 generation of the <b>single-cross</b> <b>hybrid</b> PX- 95. The two step selection procedure involved a stratified mass selection system that included check plants for environmental control. In the first step, plants having grain yield higher than 80 % of the check-plant mean and protein concentration greater than the check-plant mean were selected. In the second step, the four plants within each selection grid having the highest protein concentration were selected, which resulted in a final selection intensity of 5 %, Three cycles of selection were completed during 1991 to 1995. Response to selection was evaluated during the selection process and by direct field evaluation of the C- 0, C- 1, C- 2, and C- 3 populations in 1995 and 1996. The average response during the selection was 5. 1 % cycle(- 1) for yield, 0. 8 g kg(- 1) cycle(- 1) for protein concentration, and 7. 0 % cycle(- 1) for protein yield. No measurable differences among cycles were observed in the direct field evaluation even though the trends in the means of the cycles followed the trends shown during selection. After three cycles, the mass selection system studied did not appear to be particularly effective...|$|E
