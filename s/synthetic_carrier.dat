All of the conjugates were immunogenic when administered either in complete Freund's adjuvant or with N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine in aqueous medium. Positive immune response toward the octadecapeptide was obtained in mice as well. In this case, the immunogenic combinations were conjugates with bovine serum albumin administered either in Freund's adjuvant or with the muramyl dipeptide and a complete synthetic conjugate comprising both the octadecapeptide and the muramyl dipeptide covalently attached to a <b>synthetic</b> <b>carrier,</b> multichain poly(DLAla).

Favorable characteristics of suitable polymers include nucleic acid binding, compaction, protection, and biocompatibility. However the lack of nucleic acid transfer activity in transfection-based screening often abandons promising candidates. Here we present that functionalization may turn polycations with poor delivery activity into efficient carriers:[*] for example, polylysine, on its own lacking nucleic acid transfer activity, displayed high efficiency in siRNA delivery after modification with polyethylene glycol and a pH-responsive endosomolytic peptide. Hence these findings have implication for the selection process of polymeric carriers for siRNA. ...|$|E

To improve the <b>synthetic</b> <b>carrier’s</b> efficacy, knowledge of their biodistribution and elimination pathways, as well as cellular barriers faced, depending on the administration route, is necessary. Indeed, the in vivo fate guides the adaptation of their chemical structure and formulation to increase their transfection capacity while maintaining their tolerance. With this goal, lipidic fluorescent probes were synthesized and formulated with cationic lipophosphoramidate KLN 47 (KLN: Karine Le Ny). We found that such formulations present constant compaction properties and similar transfection results without inducing additional cytotoxicity. Next, biodistribution profiles of pegylated and unpegylated lipoplexes were compared after systemic injection in mice. Pegylation of complexes led to a prolonged circulation in the bloodstream, whereas their in vivo bioluminescent expression profiles were similar. Moreover, systemic administration of pegylated lipoplexes resulted in a transient liver toxicity. These results indicate that these new fluorescent compounds could be added into lipoplexes in small amounts without perturbing the transfection capacities of the formulations.

40|$|Currently, {{the use of}} cultured {{epithelial}} autografts as {{an alternative}} to split-thickness skin autografts for coverage of full-thickness wounds is limited due to fragility of the sheet and variability in the outcome of healing. This could be circumvented by the transfer of proliferating keratinocytes, instead of differentiated sheets, to the wound bed and the "in vivo" regeneration of epidermis. The aim {{of this study was to}} achieve re-epithelialization on experimental full-thickness wounds in the pig using a porous, <b>synthetic</b> <b>carrier</b> seeded with proliferating keratinocytes. Porcine keratinocytes were isolated by enzymatic digestion and cultured in Optimem basal medium with mitogens. In a full-thickness wound model, carriers with different seeding densities were transplanted upside down onto the wound bed. Keratinocytes were labeled using a fluorescent red membrane marker, PKH- 26 GL. Transfer of keratinocytes and re-epithelialization were recorded macroscopically and histologically. On day 4 after transplantation, transfer of fluorescently labeled keratinocytes was shown by their presence in the granulation tissue. An immature epidermis, as well as epithelial cords and islands, formed as early as day 8. At day 12 a stratified epidermis and wound closure were established and epithelial cysts were formed by differentiation of epithelial islands. Wounds treated with seeding densities as low as 50, 000 cells/cm(2) showed wound closure within 12 days, whereas wounds treated with 10, 000 cells/cm(2) or the nonseeded (acellular) carriers did not show complete re-epithelialization before day 17 after treatment.

Further experiments showed that there existed several differences between free and conjugated MDP. Thus, after intravenous administration of the conjugate, the fever pattern was monophasic with a prompt defervescence and not accompanied by eu-kopenia at dosage levels inducing similar increase in body temperature.

There {{is a need for}} new therapeutic approaches to treat these resistant wounds. Donor mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown to assist cutaneous wound healing by accelerating re-epithelialization. The aim of this work was to devise a low risk and convenient delivery method for transferring these cells to wound beds. Plasma polymerization was used to functionalize the surface of medical-grade silicone with acrylic acid. Cells attached well to these carriers, and culture for up to 3 days on the carriers did not significantly affect their phenotype or ability to support vascular tubule formation. These carriers were then used to transfer MSCs onto human dermis. Cell transfer was confirmed using an MTT assay to assess viable cell numbers and enhanced green fluorescent protein-labeled MSCs to demonstrate that the cells post-transfer attached to the dermis.

Others have previously demonstrated that siRNA mediated knockdown targeting both the viral NP and PA genes significantly inhibits influenza replication (Ge et al. 2004; Khantasup et al. 2014; Stoppani et al. 2015; Tompkins et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2007, 2008). However, the challenge of intracellular delivery of these RNAi-mediating agents has historically been an obstacle to harnessing their capabilities and clinical application (Li and Shen 2009). SiRNAs require a delivery vehicle, and two examples are genetically engineered viruses and <b>synthetic</b> <b>carriers</b> (Aigner 2009; DeVincenzo 2012; Ge et al. 2004; Li et al. 2006).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{parallel}} two-stranded alpha-helical coiled coil is {{the most}} frequently encountered subunit-oligomerization motif in proteins. The simplicity and regularity of this motif have made it an attractive system to explore some of the fundamental principles of protein folding and stability and to test the principles of de novo design. RESULTS: The X-ray crystal structure of the 18 -heptad-repeat alpha-helical coiled-coil domain of the actin-bundling protein cortexillin I from Dictyostelium discoideum is a tightly packed parallel two-stranded alpha-helical coiled coil. It harbors a distinct 14 -residue sequence motif that is essential for coiled-coil formation, and {{is a prerequisite for}} the assembly of cortexillin I. The atomic structure reveals novel types of ionic coiled-coil interactions. In particular, the structure shows that a characteristic interhelical and intrahelical salt-bridge pattern, in combination with the hydrophobic interactions occurring at the dimer interface, is the key structural feature of its coiled-coil trigger site. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge gained from the structure could be used in the de novo design of alpha-helical coiled coils for applications such as two-stage drug targeting and delivery systems, and in the design of coiled coils as templates for combinatorial helical libraries in drug discovery and as <b>synthetic</b> <b>carrier</b> molecules...|$|E
40|$|Delivery {{systems for}} tumour {{targeting}} {{fall into two}} basic categories: drug conjugate systems, in which individual drug molecules are chemically modified to target them directly to the tumour; and carrier-based systems, in which the drug or gene is first packaged non-covalently into a <b>synthetic</b> <b>carrier</b> that is then targeted to the tumour. In both cases, {{the objective is to}} maximise exposure of the target cells to the drug yet minimise side effects that result from nonspecific toxicity in normal tissues. The creation of such dose differentials is based on phenotypic differences between the tumour {{and the rest of the}} body. However, although a wide range of such changes have been linked to the transformation of normal cells to cancer cells, no single common feature exists to allow unambiguous targeting to the tumour. In addition, the tumour microenvironment creates physical barriers that significantly impair transport within the tumour. It is therefore important to match the delivery requirements of the drug to the capabilities of the delivery system.

By spectrophotometric titrations of human serum transferrin with various Fe 3 +-carrier ampholyte solutions, we demonstrated that under these conditions carrier ampholytes behave as typical chelators, their binding curves being {{very similar to that}} obtained with disodium nitrilotriacetate. On performing titration experiments at three different pH values, carrier ampholytes act like nitrilotriacetate at pH 7. 5, but the former are more effective iron donors at pH 8. 4 and worse iron donors at pH 5. 2. Spectrophotometric titrations of isolated C-terminal and N-terminal fragments obtained from human serum transferrin by thermolysin cleavage show no differences between them, and no differences with respect to the whole protein except that they contain half the number of binding sites. In order to determine a site-specificity of iron in the presence of ampholytes, the classical urea/polyacrylamide-gel-electrophoresis technique was adopted. Under saturating conditions carrier ampholyte solutions act mostly on the C-terminal site, whereas desaturating agents remove iron preferentially from the N-terminal site. Our findings support the hypothesis that Ampholine may chelate Fe 3 + as well as many other compounds...|$|E

Longer chains tilt the binding site away from the interface, potentially freeing the transporter or complex to move through the membrane.

This polymer was made from an endogenous monomer professionally condensing genes in sperms, spermine, and a known safety drug metabolite, imidazole- 4, 5 -dicarboxylic acid, through a bis-amide bond conjugated with the imidazole ring. This polymer can condense pDNA at a W/W ratio above 10 to form polyplexes (100 &ndash; 200 nm in diameter), which is consistent with the observation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the zeta potential was in the range of 10 &ndash; 20 mV. The pDNA packaged polymer was stable in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH 7. 4 (simulated body fluid) while the polyplexes were releasing pDNA into the solution at pH 5. 8 (simulated endo-lysosomes) due to the degradation of the bis-amide linkages in response to changes in pH values. PSIA-polyplexes were able to achieve efficient cellular uptake and luciferase gene silencing by co-transfection of pDNA and siRNA in COS- 7 cells and HepG 2 cells with negligible cytotoxicity.

The broader concept of drinking water biofiltration includes (semi) natural systems such as riverbank filtration (RBF) and soil aquif er treatment (SAT), as well as mechanical/engi neered systems such as rapid sand filters (RSFs), GAC filters, and slow sand filters (SSFs) [2, 4, 5]. This article covers only the mechanical/ engineered systems used predominantly in centralized drinking water treatment. Variants of the biofiltration process represent some of the oldest drinking water treatm ent practi ces in the world. Recorded references to the use of RBF date back to several millennia: “ and all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river ” (The Bible, Exodus 7 : 24). The first industrial sand filtration systems in European drinking water treatment processes were pioneered about two centuries ago by John Gibb (Scotland, 1804) and James Simpson (England, 1829) [6]. However, the micro biological nature of biofilters was initially neither obvious nor necessarily intended. These first systems were installed as straining filters for turbidity removal and later used effectively for the containment of cholera, well before any definitive knowledge on bacteria in drinking water existed. It is common knowledge today that microorganisms are indigenous to drinking water treatment and distribution systems, where they can colonize nearly any surfac e and establish complex and vibrant communities in the low nutrient environment [1]. More importantly, within the context of drinking water treatment and biofiltration, bacterial presence is not only opportunistic or negative, but in fact forms the basis of treatment for the production of high-quality drinking water. This functional role of microorganisms in the treatment processes emerged about 50 years ago, with several studies investigating the presence and possible role o...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{optimization}} of <b>synthetic</b> <b>carriers</b> for {{gene transfer}} remains a major challenge. Cationic polymers such as polyethylenimine (PEI) often show increasing gene transfer activity with increasing molecular weight, but this favorable effect {{is accompanied by}} an undesired increase in cytotoxicity. Moreover, the polydispersity of polymers prevents accurate determination of optimum size. Herein we describe the step-by-step elongation of precise linear oligo(ethanamino) amides by making use of the artificial amino acid succinoyl-tetraethylene pentamine (Stp) for solid-phase-assisted synthesis. This procedure enabled us to identify the optimal oligomer Stp 30 -W (8. 4 kDa) with a length of 30 Stp units, with which effective gene transfer occurs {{in the absence of}} cytotoxicity. The transfection efficiency of Stp 30 -W exceeded that of standard linear PEI (22 kDa) by sixfold; nevertheless, Stp 30 -W exhibited tenfold lower cytotoxicity. In addition to the lower molecular weight, the succinate spacer between the oligoamine units may also contribute to the favorable biocompatibility. The cytotoxicity of the cationic polymer PEI is a major concern for use as a carrier for gene delivery, so this comparison between linear PEI and the new Stp oligomers is particularly relevant...|$|R

They are routinely used to design therapeutic carriers, such as nanoparticles, for applications in drug delivery. Current strategies for synthesizing drug delivery carriers are based either on discovery of materials or development of fabrication methods. While <b>synthetic</b> <b>carriers</b> have brought upon numerous advances in drug delivery, they fail to match the sophistication exhibited by innate biological entities. In particular, red blood cells (RBCs), the most ubiquitous cell type in the human blood, constitute highly specialized entities with unique shape, size, mechanical flexibility, and material composition, all of which are optimized for extraordinary biological performance. Inspired by this natural example, we synthesized particles that mimic the key structural and functional features of RBCs. Similar to their natural counterparts, RBC-mimicking particles described here possess the ability to carry oxygen and flow through capillaries smaller than their own diameter. Further, they can also encapsulate drugs and imaging agents. These particles provide a paradigm for the design of drug delivery and imaging carriers, because they combine the functionality of natural RBCs with the broad applicability and versatility of synthetic drug delivery particles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Among <b>synthetic</b> <b>carriers,</b> dendrimers {{with the}} more {{flexible}} structure have attracted {{a great deal of}} researchers’ attention in the field of gene delivery. Followed by the promising results upon hydrophobic modification on polymeric structures in our laboratory, alkylcarboxylated poly (propylenimine) -based carriers were synthesized by nucleophilic substitution of amines with alkyl moieties and were further characterized for their physicochemical and biological characteristics for plasmid DNA delivery. Although not noticeably effective gene transfer activity for hexanoate- and hexadecanoate-modified series was observed, but alkylation by decanoic acid significantly improved the transfection efficiency of the final constructs up to 60 fold in comparison with unmodified poly(propylenimine) (PPI). PPI modified by 10 -bromodecanoic acid at 50 % grafting, showed significantly higher gene expression at c/p ratio of 2 compared to Superfect as positive control.   Overall, modification of PPI with 50 % primary amines grafting with 10 -bromodecanoic acid could increase the transfection efficiency which is occurred at lower c/p ratio when compared to Superfect, i. e. less amount of modified vector is required to exhibit the same efficiency as Superfect. Therefore, the obtained constructs seem to be safer carriers for long-term gene therapy applications...|$|R
40|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>carriers</b> play an {{important}} role in immunogen presentation, due to their ability of inducing improved and specific responses to conjugated epitopes. Their influence on the bio- active conformation of the epitope though admittedly crucial for the relevant in vitro and in vivo applications. is difficult to evaluate, given the usual lack of information on the complex conformational features determined by the nature of the carrier and the mode of ligation. Using the Herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D- 1 epitope (Leu(9) -Lys-Nle-Ala-A. vp-Pi-o-Asn-Ai-g-Phe-Ai-,g-Gly-Lys-Asp-Lea(22)) as a model, we have performed a detailed conformational analysis on the free epitope peptide in solution and on three constructs in which the epitope was conjugated to sequential oligopeptide carriers [Ac-[Lys-Aib-GlY](4) -OH (SOC(4)) } (through either a thioether or an anfide bond; Ac: acetyl) and polytuftsin oligomers [H-[Thr-Lys-Pro-Lys-GlY](4) -NH(2) (T 20) }, (through a thioether bond). The analysis qf the epitope conformation in the parent protein, in carrier-conjugated and free form, suggests that the beta-turn structure of the -Asp(13) -Pro-Asn-Arg(16) segment is highly conserved and independent of the epitope form. However, small conformational variations were observed at the C-terminal part of the epitope, depending on the nature of the carrier. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals...|$|R
