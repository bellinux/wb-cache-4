2500|$|Jutland {{proved to}} be decisive in Beatty's career, despite the loss of two of his battlecruisers. Beatty is {{reported}} to have remarked (to his Flag Captain, Ernle Chatfield, later First Sea Lord in the early 1930s), [...] "there <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> wrong with our bloody ships today," [...] after two of them had exploded within half an hour during the battle. In any case Beatty's actions succeeded in drawing the German High Seas Fleet into action against the British Grand Fleet.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1974 book Anarchy, State and Utopia philosopher Robert Nozick {{discusses}} an [...] "experience machine", {{a hypothetical}} device which can provide its users with any simulated reality they desire. If given the choice, {{would we want}} to plug ourselves into such a machine? If not, then according to Nozick there <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> wrong with hedonism, the view that pleasure and happiness are the primary or most important intrinsic goods and the proper aim of human life. Nozick's thought experiment has been widely debated since.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after 16:26, a salvo struck on {{or around}} , which was {{obscured}} by spray and smoke from shell bursts. A signalman promptly leapt {{on to the}} bridge of Lion and announced [...] "Princess Royals blown up, Sir." [...] Beatty famously turned to his flag captain, saying [...] "Chatfield, there <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> wrong with our bloody ships today." [...] (In popular legend, Beatty also immediately ordered his ships to [...] "turn two points to port", i.e., two points nearer the enemy, {{but there is no}} official record of any such command or course change.) Princess Royal, as it turned out, was still afloat after the spray cleared.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, that's all right,' said Mike thickly. There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{sticking}} in his throat, preventing him from speaking.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Brewster was silent.--Much as it {{went against}} the grain to have to admit it, there <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Silverbridge," [...] {{said the}} Duke, [...] "how are matters {{going on with}} you?" [...] There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in his father's manner more than ordinarily jocund and good-humoured.|$|R
2500|$|The show's {{official}} website describes Leslie as a [...] "skilled attorney". She {{is a lawyer}} at Vance Abram's law firm. Conwell stated: [...] "She's sharp as a tack and self-assured." [...] Of Leslie's on and off storyline, Conwell said: [...] "With my character being a lawyer there always <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{going on in the}} city so Leslie is out there tending to her business". She explained that Leslie loves what she does, and [...] "finds different angles" [...] in cases which she can focus on. When Leslie first arrived, she became a [...] "one-time" [...] love interest for long-running character Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John). The couple didn't last long. Conwell said that when Leslie and Neil first hooked up, they went [...] "in for the kill" [...] and moved fast, but she wasn't sure whether the romance would be revisited.|$|E
2500|$|During the First World War Chatfield {{was present}} as Beatty's Flag-Captain in the Lion at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914, at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 {{and at the}} Battle of Jutland in May 1916. It was at Jutland, after two British battlecruisers had blown up, that Beatty made his famous remark, [...] "There <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> wrong with our bloody ships today, Chatfield". Appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Companion on 31 May 1916 and to the Order of the Bath as a Companion in the 1916 Birthday Honours, Chatfield went on to command the {{battleship}} HMS Iron Duke, Beatty's flagship as Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet, in November 1916 and then the battleship , Beatty's new flagship in the same role, in February 1917. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 5 April 1919.|$|E
2500|$|Admiral of the Fleet David Richard Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty [...] (17 January 1871 – 11 March 1936) was a Royal Navy officer. After {{serving in}} the Mahdist War and then the {{response}} to the Boxer Rebellion, he commanded the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron at the Battle of Jutland in 1916, a tactically indecisive engagement after which his aggressive approach was contrasted with the caution of his commander Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. He is remembered for his comment at Jutland that [...] "There <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> wrong with our bloody ships today", after two of his ships exploded. Later in the war he succeeded Jellicoe as Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, in which capacity he received the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet {{at the end of the}} war. He then followed Jellicoe's path a second time, serving as First Sea Lord—a position that Beatty held longer (7 years 9 months) than any other First Sea Lord in history. [...] While First Sea Lord, he was involved in negotiating the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 in which it was agreed that the United States, Britain and Japan should set their navies in a ratio of 5:5:3, with France and Italy maintaining smaller ratio fleets of 1.75 each.|$|E
60|$|There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{behind this}} remark, but before I could inquire into it we were {{interrupted}} by Mr. Cooke, {{who was standing}} on the beach, swearing and gesticulating for the boat.|$|R
60|$|Once more he took Andrew by the hand, and led {{him into}} the meeting-room; and still his {{eyes were fixed on}} the probationer's neck. There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> about it that he liked.|$|R
6000|$|There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> like {{peculiar}} {{emphasis on}} the words [...] "My friend Hermann," [...] which caused one of us (for we had just been speaking of heroism at sea) to say idly and nonchalantly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dix," [...] he continued, [...] "as you know, I {{am not a}} superstitious man, {{but there}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> about this trip I can't fathom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Blake! there <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> here which wants {{clearing}} up. May I ask how {{you know}} that the Diamond is, at this moment, in London?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you just}} go to the bow and take a squint ahead? I think there <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> like an end o' the cliffs in view--your eyes are better than mine." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{she should}} have had {{sufficient}} self-possession to say good morning amazed me. Her whole appearance, in fact, amazed me. There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> wanting in her manner. I endeavored to get myself into condition.|$|R
60|$|Lord Marshmoreton coughed. George {{looked at}} him with some surprise. He had {{supposed}} the interview <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at an end, but the other made no move <b>to</b> go. There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> on the earl's mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word, Woods, {{there does}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in all this! It {{can hardly be}} {{possible}} that the Americans would dare to attack Boston, defended as it is, by a strong army of British regulars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{she is not}} on {{that account}} ready to {{transfer}} her affections at a moment's notice. To her view of the matter there <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> a little indelicate in the idea." ...|$|E
6000|$|The captain {{turned and}} looked at his daughter. [...] "There <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> very foggy about this statement," [...] said he. [...] "I hope the weather will soon clear up, so we can get our bearings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must say}} I don't like this," [...] said Shep, {{after they had}} {{questioned}} the old hermit to ascertain that his story was a straight one. [...] "There <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> supernatural about it; don't you think so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{working in}} her bosom after that last cry; {{presently}} she broke out, [...] "And {{what is the}} meaning of all this? Why is all this shame loundered on my head? How could you dare it, David Balfour?" ...|$|R
6000|$|There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> very comical in the {{reputation}} of Mr. Brooks of Sheffield, for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he was mentioned, and Mr. Murdstone {{was a good deal}} amused also. After some laughing, the gentleman whom he had called Quinion, said: ...|$|R
60|$|Tavernake {{left her}} with a long breath of relief {{and made his way}} towards the Strand. At the corner of Wellington Street he {{came face to face with}} Pritchard. They stopped at once. There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{embarrassing}} about this meeting. Pritchard patted him familiarly on the shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's marvelous!" [...] he murmured. [...] "A {{single word}} {{like that and}} I suffer in an {{absolutely}} indescribable sort of way. There <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> pulling at me all the time, even when it rises to my lips." ...|$|E
6000|$|His face hardened. [...] "There <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> like bearing malice in this," [...] he said. [...] "Are you {{treating}} me, for {{the first}} time, to an exhibition of enmity? What am I to call it, if it's not that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've tried," [...] {{admitted}} Bridge; [...] "but {{there always}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> lacking in my stuff--it don't get under your belt--the divine afflatus is not there. I may start out all right, but I {{always end up}} where I didn't expect to go, and where nobody wants to be." ...|$|E
60|$|Archie had {{a dinner}} and theatre {{engagement}} that night, {{and it was}} late {{when he returned to}} the hotel. He found his father-in-law prowling restlessly about the lobby. There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> on Mr. Brewster's mind. He came up to Archie with a brooding frown on his square face.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Tetterby did {{not enjoy}} her supper. There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> on Mrs. Tetterby's mind. At one time she laughed without reason, and at another time she cried without reason, and at last she laughed and cried {{together}} in a manner so very unreasonable {{that her husband was}} confounded.|$|R
60|$|She {{remained}} {{on the side of}} his chair, still holding his arm. The Marquis sank back with a little air of relief. There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> different, something warmer in the world. He was moved by a rare and unaccountable impulse--he drew her towards him and kissed her lips.|$|R
6000|$|... “‘I {{know nothing}} about war,’ a boy of {{nineteen}} said to me two days [...] ago, ‘except, of course, that I’ve heard of its horrors; yet, [...] somehow, {{in spite of the}} horrors, there <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in it [...] different to anything else in the world, something a little bit [...] finer.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Without answering, {{without even}} {{appearing}} {{to have heard}} Midwinter's proposal to go upstairs, Allan followed him mechanically {{as far as the}} opposite side of the window. There he stopped. [...] "Midwinter!" [...] he burst out, in a sudden panic of astonishment and alarm, [...] "there <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> strange between us! You're not like yourself. What is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{said nothing}} of the kind. And if I did, I didn't mean it. I don't wish to be unjust, Mr. Pepper, but I must say that to me there <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{positively}} fiendish in {{a man who can}} go {{out of his way to}} separate a husband from his wife, simply in order to amuse himself by gloating over his agony----" ...|$|E
6000|$|He even {{learned to}} enjoy sitting in throned state in council, and <b>seeming</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{more than the}} Lord Protector's mouthpiece. He liked to receive great ambassadors and their {{gorgeous}} trains, {{and listen to the}} affectionate messages they brought from illustrious monarchs who called him brother. O happy Tom Canty, late of Offal Court! ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly a water snake wriggled {{across the}} dark pool above the ford, and the minnows {{disappeared}} {{under the shadow}} of the bridge. Then Will sighed, lifted his head, and walked on. There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> prophetic in it, and he drew a long breath. That's the way his plans broke and faded away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was on my}} way," [...] he said, [...] "when I {{heard the}} war rumours. There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in it, so I came back as fast as express trains and steamers would bring me. I only landed in England this morning. I am {{applying}} for the post of correspondent to the London News." ...|$|R
