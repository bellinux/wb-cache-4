40|$|Rapid {{prototyping}} (RP) {{technology has}} been widely used in making prototypes {{for quite a long}} time. However, an in-depth study of methods used to fabricate jewellery products with RP is not available. In this paper, a new direct and adaptive slicing methodology is applied to three-dimensional <b>solid</b> <b>jewel</b> ring models to produce maximum inscribed three-dimensional stacked slab models. Jewel rings that are symmetrical in one or more principal planes XY, YZ and ZX are considered. The maximum inscribed slab model will minimize material wastage in post-treatment processes and preserve the symmetric property of the original jewel ring model. A solid torus is used as a simplified representation of the jewel ring in the description of the methodology. A case study based on the methodology is presented.

6000|$|The {{two figures}} that they {{followed}} were crawling like black flies across the huge green contour of a hill. They were evidently sunk in conversation, and perhaps {{did not notice}} where they were going; but they were certainly going to the wilder and more silent heights of the Heath. As their pursuers gained on them, the latter {{had to use the}} undignified attitudes of the deer-stalker, to crouch behind clumps of trees and even to crawl prostrate in deep grass. By these ungainly ingenuities the hunters even came close enough to the quarry to hear the murmur of the discussion, but no word could be distinguished except the word [...] "reason" [...] recurring frequently in a high and almost childish voice. Once over an abrupt dip of land and a dense tangle of thickets, the detectives actually lost the two figures they were following. They did not find the trail again for an agonising ten minutes, and then it led round the brow of a great dome of hill overlooking an amphitheatre of rich and desolate sunset scenery. Under a tree in this commanding yet neglected spot was an old ramshackle wooden seat. On this seat sat the two priests still in serious speech together. The gorgeous green and gold still clung to the darkening horizon; but the dome above was turning slowly from peacock-green to peacock-blue, and the stars detached themselves more and more like <b>solid</b> <b>jewels.</b> Mutely motioning to his followers, Valentin contrived to creep up behind the big branching tree, and, standing there in deathly silence, heard the words of the strange priests for the first time.|$|R
50|$|The 1990s {{also saw}} {{a number of other}} labels owned by or {{thoroughly}} associated with Laswell, come and go. The most prolific of these was Subharmonic, conceived by Laswell and ex-Celluloid A&R Robert Soares. Though not owned by Laswell, the label was essentially a release house for his projects, most of which fell into the ambient or ambient-dub categories. The label also licensed a few releases from European labels for American re-release, notably Psychonavigation (with Pete Namlook) and Cymatic Scan (with Tetsu Inoue) from Pete Namlook's FAX label, and Somnific Flux (with Mick Harris - there as MJ Harris) and Cold Summer (by Lull - a Mick Harris project) from the Sentrax label. Other collaborators included Jonah Sharp and Terre Thaemlitz. The label also released albums from Painkiller, Praxis and Laswell's new project, Divination, an ambient dub project (first appearing almost as a project title, and then an umbrella moniker for releases of ambient compilations). Additionally, a sub-label called Strata was created containing five releases mostly in what could be deemed a more experimental dub/noise/ambient vein. Each of these releases (Death Cube K, Cypher 7, Azonic and two under his alias Automaton) came housed in a <b>solid</b> black <b>jewel</b> case with the name of the project and album title printed on the front.|$|R
