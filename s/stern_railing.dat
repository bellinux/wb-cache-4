60|$|A gunboat {{came out}} from behind the Cavite pier, and made {{directly}} for the Olympia. In less than five minutes she was in a sinking condition; as she turned, a shell struck her just inside the <b>stern</b> <b>railing,</b> and she disappeared beneath the waves as if crushed by some titanic force.|$|E
6000|$|They {{had gone}} but {{a hundred yards}} from the Turk when a head {{appeared}} over the <b>stern</b> <b>railing</b> of the poop, and a figure swung itself on to the deck. The man was attired in Turkish garments, but his head was bare, and the exclamation, [...] "A Christian!" [...] broke from the knights.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Coming home,' Keller repeated, {{leaning over}} the stern. I ran to his side and saw the log-line, which till then had been drawn tense over the <b>stern</b> <b>railing,</b> slacken, loop, and come up off the port quarter. Frithiof called up the {{speaking}} tube to the bridge, and the bridge answered, 'Yes, nine knots.' Then Frithiof spoke again, and the answer was, 'What do you want of the skipper?' and Frithiof bellowed, 'Call him up.' ...|$|E
50|$|The {{first to}} find the Moby Prince wreck (at 23:35, over {{an hour after the}} collision) were two tugboat operators, Mauro Valli and Walter Mattei, who managed to recover the only survivor, Alessio Bertrand, a ship's boy hanging from the <b>stern</b> <b>railing.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{was noted}} during the episode {{that the story}} of Charles Joughin, the Titanic's chief baker, contradicted the myth. He testified in a 1912 enquiry that he held onto the <b>stern</b> <b>railing</b> of the ship as it went down. As the ship went under, he stepped off; his hair did not get wet, much less himself get sucked under with the ship. However, the story does hold some credence, as many ships emit a large amount of air, as they sink. This massive amount of air, rising to the surface, creates a situation, whereby there is loss of buoyancy, in the air bubbles and anyone caught in this will sink, hence the belief that the ship is 'pulling' a {{floating}} person down with it.|$|E
