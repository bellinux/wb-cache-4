5|$|In reptiles, {{features}} of the scales are important in distinguishing among species and groups of species. In the Noronha skink, the supranasal scales (located above the nose) are in contact, as are the prefrontal scales (behind the nose) in most individuals. The two frontoparietal scales (above and slightly behind the eyes) are not fused. Unlike in T.maculata, the parietal scales (behind the frontoparietals) are in contact with each other. There are four supraocular scales (above the eyes) in almost all specimens and five supraciliary scales (immediately above the eyes, below the supraoculars). The dorsal <b>scales</b> (<b>on</b> the upperparts) have three keels, two fewer than in T.maculata. There are 34 to 40 (mode 38) midbody scales (counted around the body midway between the fore- and hindlimbs), 58 to 69 (mode 63–64) dorsal, and 66 to 78 (mode 70) ventral <b>scales</b> (<b>on</b> the underparts). Mabuya species and T.maculata generally have fewer midbody scales (up to 34). There are 21 to 29subdigital lamellae under the fourth toe, more than in T.maculata, which has 18. The Noronha skink has 26presacral vertebrae (located before the sacrum), similar to most Trachylepis, but unlike American Mabuya, which have at least 28.|$|E
5|$|Other {{members of}} the genus Pholiota may be mistaken for Pholiota flammans, {{especially}} Pholiota squarrosa which commonly forms large tufts {{at the base of}} deciduous as well as coniferous trees. P.squarrosa tends to be a less intense yellow color than P.flammans. P.adiposa is also similar, but prefers to grow on dead hardwoods; unlike P.flammans, it has gelatinous <b>scales</b> <b>on</b> the stem as well as the cap.|$|E
5|$|Scales {{may have}} evolved {{initially}} for providing insulation. <b>Scales</b> <b>on</b> the thorax {{and other parts}} of the body may contribute to maintaining the high body temperatures required during flight. The 'solid' scales of basal moths are however not as efficient as those of their more advanced relatives as the presence of a lumen adds air layers and increases the insulation value. Scales also help increase the lift to drag ratio in gliding flight.|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the causal factors influencing students adversity between twelfth grade and third-year vocational students in Sisaket province, Thailand. Six hundred and seventy two of twelfth grade and 376 third-year vocational students were selected by multi-stage random sampling techniques. Approach: The instruments used for collecting data were: A <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> self-esteem, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> dominance, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> self-confidence, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> sense of personal freedom, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> achievement motivation, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> ambition, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> enthusiasm, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> responsibility, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> future orientation, and an adversity quotient scale. The data were analyzed by validity test of the causal relationship model. Results: The results of the study were as follows: (1) variables influencing the adversity quotient of 12 th grade and third-year vocational students were dominance, sense of personal freedom, self-esteem, enthusiasm, self-confidence, ambition and achievement motivation. (2) Variables are directly influencing the adversity quotient of twelfth grade students was self-confidence while the variables both directly and indirectly influencing the adversity quotient of students were dominance, sense of personal freedom, self-esteem, and enthusiasm. (3) Variable are directly influencing adversity quotient of third-year vocational students was achievement motivation, the variables are indirectly influencing the adversity quotient of these students was dominance while the variables both directly and indirectly influencing the adversity quotient of these students were sense of personal freedom, self-esteem, enthusiasm, self-confidence, and ambition. Conclusion: In conclusion, {{the results of this study}} could be used as beneficial information for parents, teachers and those involved in education for developing students to have adversity quotient as well as to be used as guidelines for providing education in the future...|$|R

5|$|The {{external}} morphology of Lepidoptera is {{the physiological}} {{structure of the}} bodies of insects belonging to the order Lepidoptera, also known as butterflies and moths. Lepidoptera are distinguished from other orders {{by the presence of}} <b>scales</b> <b>on</b> the external parts of the body and appendages, especially the wings. Butterflies and moths vary in size from microlepidoptera only a few millimetres long, to a wingspan of many inches such as the Atlas moth. Comprising over 160,000 described species, the Lepidoptera possess variations of the basic body structure which has evolved to gain advantages in adaptation and distribution.|$|E
5|$|The {{feathers}} are outgrowths of the epidermis and {{are found}} in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near {{the base of the}} tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens. There are <b>scales</b> <b>on</b> the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of Stropharia caerulea {{feature a}} greenish-blue cap sparsely covered in white flecks of veil at the margin, and a sticky, glutinous surface texture. Gills on the cap {{underside}} have an adnate or sinuate {{attachment to the}} stipe. They are initially pale purplish-brown, becoming darker brown in age as the spores mature. The greenish stipe is covered in white scales up to a thin, transient ring. It is similar in appearance to its less common relative Stropharia aeruginosa, but that species has a more robust ring on its stipe, more <b>scales</b> <b>on</b> the cap, and darker gills with white edges.|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: The {{importance}} of agriculture industry in enhancing the country economy cannot be denied. Recently, {{a total of}} USD 1. 7 billion has been allocated {{by the government to}} boost this industry. Beside of this huge allocation, do the policy implementers which are the agriculture extension officers have adequate work performance to carry out the responsibility given to them? Approach: This study would like to discover whether quality of work life among the agriculture extension employee do have impact their work performance or not. It is necessary to estimate quality of work life function in enhancing work performance, analyze the most important factor and variables on this work performance. The instruments used for collecting data were: A <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> individual and family life, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> safety and security on the organization, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> interpersonal relationship in the organization, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> job satisfaction, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> organizational policies and management style, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> personnel health and well being, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> work environment, a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> remuneration and a <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> organizational support. The data were analyzed PASW software. Results: Results depict that all of the nine qualities of work life studied have significant and positive relationship with work performance where the highest relationship occurred between individual and family life with work performance. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that five factors which are individual and family life, job satisfaction, organization policy and management style, work environment and remuneration are the main contributors to work performance among government agricultural extension employees. Conclusion/Recommendations: From the results gained, it can be concluded that aspect of individual and family life is the highest contributor to work performance among government agriculture extension officer. It can be noted that more courses on how to manage individual and family life should be intensified. A specific counseling department should be established within agriculture agencies in Malaysia. From this study, it is recommended for the future researchers to investigate more on the influence of individual and family life on work performance and work satisfaction in Malaysia...|$|R

5|$|The spores are {{spindle-shaped}} to elliptical, have {{a smooth}} surface, and dimensions of 8–11 to 3–4µm. There are both two- and four-spored basidia (spore-bearing cells), {{and they are}} club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), with dimensions of 28–36 by 10–12µm. Cystidia are plentiful, and are found in bundles lined along the tube mouths (as cheilocystidia), or more commonly, singly {{along the sides of}} the tubes (as pleurocystidia). These structures are thin-walled, cylindrical, and measure 48–60 by 7–9µm. The <b>scales</b> <b>on</b> the cap surface comprise more or less erect hyphae with tips that are clustered together.

5|$|The sunset moth {{is black}} with {{iridescent}} red, {{blue and green}} markings. There is a fringe of white <b>scales</b> <b>on</b> the wing edges, wider on the hindwings. The moth has six tails, very often lost or damaged during its life. Pattern variations are common, and the moth is often partly asymmetrical; {{one of the factors}} causing this is temperature shock during the pupal stage.|$|E
5|$|The tail appears {{naked and}} is shorter than or {{about as long}} as the head and body; it is longer in T.talamancae. Its {{coloration}} is variable; it is dark brown above and at the sides and light brown and often white to a greater or smaller extent below, and in some specimens the tail has the same color above and below. The <b>scales</b> <b>on</b> the tail are smaller than in T.talamancae.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from those}} found on Corythosaurus casuarius, {{extensive}} skin impressions {{have been found}} on Edmontosaurus annectens and notable integument has also been found on Brachylophosaurus canadensis, Gryposaurus notabilis, Parasaurolophus walkeri, Lambeosaurus magnicristatus, L. lambei, Saurolophus angustirsotris and on unidentified ornithopods. Of these, L. lambei, C. casuarius, G. notabilis, P. walkeri, and S. angustirsotris have preserved polygonal scales. The <b>scales</b> <b>on</b> L. lambei, S. angustirostris and C. casuarius are all similar. Corythosaurus is one of very few hadrosaurids which have preserved skin impressions on the hind limbs and feet. A study in 2013 showed that amongst hadrosaurids, Saurolophus angustirostris preserved {{the best and most}} complete foot and limb integument, although other species like S. osborni, Edmontosaurus annectens and Lambeosaurus lambei (= L. clavinitialis) share a fair amount of preserved tissue on those regions.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, P. Mausfeld and D.

Based on differences in the number of scales, subdigital lamellae (lamellae on the lower sides of the digits), and keels (longitudinal ridges) on the dorsal scales (located on the upperparts), as well as the separation of the parietal <b>scales</b> (<b>on</b> the head behind the eyes) in maculata, they concluded that the two were not, after all, identical, and that Schmidt's name Mabuya atlantica should therefore be used. Mausfeld and Vrcibradic considered Mabouya punctatissima to represent a different species on the basis of morphological differences, but were unable to resolve the status of Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata.|$|E
