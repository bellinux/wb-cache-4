25|$|The {{eyes are}} often a focus of {{abduction}} claims. They are said to not move or focus in any observable way to the naked eye. Claims often describe a Grey <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> eyes of an abductee when conducting mental procedures. This staring is claimed to induce hallucinogenic states or directly provoke different emotions. Although abduction claimants often say that the Grey was only inches from their face during the staring mindscan procedure, they often subsequently claim to not feeling breath or seeing the Grey's chest move from breathing.|$|E

25|$|Reporters {{were denied}} access to the prisoners, but not so {{photographer}} Alexander Gardner. On April 27, Gardner began taking photographs {{of those who were}} caught up in the government's dragnet. One by one, each prisoner was brought on deck and photographed in a few positions. Gardner took far more photographs of Powell than anyone else. Powell obliged Gardner by posing seated, standing (with and without restraints), and modeling the overcoat and hat he'd worn the night of the Seward attacks. Among the most famous of these photographs is one in which Powell sits against the gun turret of the Saugus, <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> camera in a modern fashion, relaxed and direct.|$|E

25|$|Van Norren et al. (1998) {{could not}} find a single example in the medical {{literature}} of a <1nbsp&mW classnbsp&III laser causing eyesight damage. Mainster et al.

Luttrull & Hallisey (1999) describe a similar case, a 34-year-old male who stared into the beam of a classIIIa 5mW red laser for 30 to 60 seconds, causing temporary central scotoma and visual field loss. His eyesight fully recovered within two days, {{at the time of his}} eye exam. An intravenous fundus fluorescein angiogram, a technique used by ophthalmologists to visualise the retina of the eye in fine detail, identified subtle discoloration of the fovea.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for [...] "Tennis Court" [...] {{was directed by}} Joel Kefali, who previously worked with Lorde on the accompanying video for her debut single [...] "Royals". The video was filmed as a one-shot. Lorde appears in [...] "black clothing, braided hair, and dark lipstick." [...] It features Lorde <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> camera as the song plays; she does not lip sync the lyrics except for the word [...] "Yeah!" [...] after each verse and during the chorus. The set lighting fades in and out throughout the video.|$|E

The single garnered success in Oceania, peaking at {{number one on}} the New Zealand singles chart and entering the top 30 chart in Australia. In Europe, it charted in Belgium (in both Flanders and Wallonia), France, the UK and Germany; the song also appeared on multiple US charts. [...] "Tennis Court" [...] was certified platinum by both the Australian Recording Industry Association and Recorded Music NZ. A music video for the song was directed by Joel Kefali and features Lorde <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> camera during one continuous shot.

500|$|Brown {{grew up in}} the Canadian {{province}} of Quebec, where the majority speaks French, and where Riel is often considered a martyr. [...] However Brown, who grew up speaking only English, said he was largely ignorant of Riel's story until he read Maggie Siggins' 1994 biography Louis Riel: A Life of Revolution. [...] Many of Brown's favourite topics are entwined in Louis Riel: anti-authoritarianism, outsider religion, insanity, and accuracy and objectivity in nonfiction. [...] A central incident in the book is an eight-panel sequence in which Riel has a revelatory experience on a hilltop in Washington, D.C. [...] He experiences visions and talks to God, who declares him Prophet of the New World and instructs him to lead his people to freedom. [...] On the cover of the book, however, we see Riel standing alone in the wilderness, <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sky, leaving open the question of whether what he witnessed was real.|$|E
500|$|Stories {{including}} Zhou {{have also}} been used to educate. The Secondary School system of Hong Kong teaches children the value of mentorship by making them read about the close teacher-pupil relationship between Zhou and Yue. A morale tale called [...] "Yue Fei Studies Archery" [...] in Children's Pictorial, a Chinese magazine tailored for children ages two through seven, demonstrates how great achievements are only made possible via diligent practice. The story states how young Yue stumbles upon Zhou's training hall in a neighboring town while gathering fire wood. Yue applies to become a student, but Zhou tells him he must first practice {{the art of the}} [...] "far-sighted person" [...] by <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> morning sun to improve his eyesight. After years of unrelenting practice, Yue is able to spot a lone goose flying off in the distance and two cicadas on a tree far into the forest. Zhou then officially takes him as his disciple and adopted son. Under his tutelage, Yue is able to master the eighteen weapons of war and to shoot a falling leaf from one-hundred paces away.|$|E
500|$|The video {{takes place}} in a large cathedral-like room, with large winding {{staircases}} on each side. Throughout the video, the scenery changes several times from a cloudy and sunny day, to a glowing sunset. These time shifts are seen through a large carved window in the cathedral. The video begins with Carey's hair in long golden curls, and her wearing a skin-tight black jumper. She sits on the large ledge by the window, <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> different colors in the sky. As the video progresses, Carey is joined by a small black cat, which accompanies her as she meditates on the large stairwell. After the song's second verse, a large microphone is seen {{in the middle of the}} room, where scenes of Carey singing and standing on the window's ledge interchange. The last scenes show Carey staring out into the meadow, smiling. According to author Chris Nickson, during the scenes of Carey by the large window, it is [...] "obvious" [...] that she is praying to God and connecting to her creator. He felt that alongside the song's lyrics of faith and prayer, the video's moments of meditation truly went [...] "hand in hand." ...|$|E

500|$|New to acting, the {{children}} often made errors such as <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> camera, and Khan resorted to unorthodox methods {{to work around}} their rookie mistakes. For example, an early scene in the film featured a school assembly; Khan wanted the students to act naturally and to ignore the principal's speech, but recognised {{that this would be}} a difficult feat with cameras present. First Assistant Director Sunil Pandey spoke continuously in an attempt to [...] "bore the hell out of [...] ", and they eventually lost interest in the filming and behaved normally. A later scene involved Nikumbh enlightening his class about famous people who suffer from dyslexia, and {{the children}}'s responses to his speech were the last portion to be filmed. Having already spent 3–4days hearing the dialogue the children's reactions were [...] "jaded". Khan opted to film them while he recited a tale, and manipulated his storytelling to achieve the varying spontaneous reactions. The following scene had the children playing around a nearby pond. Horrified when he learned that the water was [...] deep, Khan recruited four lifeguards in case a child fell in.|$|E
500|$|... "My All" [...] and the [...] "My All/Stay Awhile" [...] (So So Def Remix) {{featured}} different music videos. The {{video for}} [...] "My All" [...] was shot entirely {{in black and}} white in Puerto Rico, and was directed by fashion photographer Herb Ritts. The video begins with Carey lying on an overturned vessel on a beach, <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night sky, lamenting her estranged lover. As the scenes progress, Carey's love interest is seen atop a lighthouse {{in the middle of the}} ocean, searching for his lost companion. Further scenes show Carey laying on a large conch shell, wet and vulnerable. Soon after, she begins walking on a path of large white flowers, until she reaches the top of the lighthouse where she is rejoined with her lover. After the song's second verse, Carey and the man begin caressing each other, and embracing atop the lighthouse. After they share an intimate moment, Carey is shown walking back on the trail of white flowers, smiling and happy. The scenes of Carey lying in the shell and in front of the flowers were inspired by Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus. According to author Chris Nickson, the snippets of Carey on the overturned vessel showed her vulnerability without her loved one, truly highlighting the yearning emphasized in the song.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} Carey walking down some {{steps onto the}} beach wearing a black bathing suit and high heel shoes, which she takes off when she gets {{to the bottom and}} walks onto the sand. Carey is seen in {{different}} shots standing next to a cliff-face {{as well as in the}} middle of the beach for the majority of the video. For the bridge, Carey is seen in multiple different shots as she walks along the shoreline, which changes as the last verse takes place, where her outfit changes from a black bathing suit to a different style white bathing suit whilst the sun sets in the background. As the video comes to an end, the scenery has changed to nighttime, and Carey is wearing another black bathing suit with a black jacket standing against a rock-face. Carey then inscribes into the sand [...] "H.A.T.E.U." [...] using her fingers, which she underlines as the video fades to black. The video is also inter-cut throughout with shots of the scenery on the beach. Rap-Up described the video as [...] "picturesque". Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that it is a [...] "slow-mo, beachwear fashion show". He continued, [...] "Equally depressed by the end of a relationship and inspired by the scenery, Mimi spends a few minutes suggestively touching herself and <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> middle distance. What becomes of the broken-hearted?" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Always Be My Baby" [...] {{was the second}} video Carey's directed. In it, she is the {{seemingly}} happy narrator of a tale of young love, {{as a young boy}} and a girl elope {{in the middle of the}} night. The video was filmed on location at Carey's sponsored charity, the Fresh Air Fund upstate New York camp. The video begins with scenes of Carey on a lakeside tire-swing, smiling and beginning to retell a story of young love. As she sits upon the swing, scenes of two children sneaking out of their bungalow in the middle of the night are shown. They frolic together beside a fireplace, soon coming up to the lakeside swing Carey had been on before. They soon go swimming wearing their clothes, much like Carey did in her video for [...] "Dreamlover" [...] though she does not jump into the water herself this time. As they jump into the water, Carey is then seen by the campfire they passed on their journey to the lake, smiling with friends and enjoying herself by the fire. Eventually the boy and girl are seen kissing underwater. The video concludes with scenes of the young boy and girl walking together back to their bungalow, walking hand-in-hand. Having possibly witnessed the entire event, Carey is seen once again by the large swing, chuckling and <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night's sky.|$|E
500|$|In December 1967, {{the group}} added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member of Pink Floyd. Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied {{with him at}} Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s. The two had {{performed}} at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France. In 1965, while a member of Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set. Morrison's assistant, Steve O'Rourke, set Gilmour up in a room at O'Rourke's house with a salary of £30 per week (...) , and in January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises announced Gilmour as the band's newest member; the second guitarist and its fifth member, the band intending to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter. Jenner commented: [...] "The idea was that Dave would... cover for [...] eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd {{was just going to}} write. Just to try to keep him involved". In an expression of his frustration, Barrett, who was expected to write additional hit singles to follow up [...] "Arnold Layne" [...] and [...] "See Emily Play", instead introduced [...] "Have You Got It Yet?" [...] to the band, intentionally changing the structure on each performance so as to make the song impossible to follow and learn. In a January 1968 photo-shoot of the five-man Pink Floyd, the photographs show Barrett looking detached from the others, <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> distance.|$|E
500|$|Similarly, Willa Paskin of New York {{magazine}} {{praised the}} final minute of the video in which [...] "we are treated to what {{is supposed to be}} the instrumental equivalent of an orgasm", illustrated by split-screen kaleidoscope effects and capped off by Beyoncé <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> camera [...] "in postcoital contentment". Mawuse Ziegbe of The Boston Globe noted that Beyoncé'ss sex appeal was at its maximum in the video for [...] "1+1". She compared the kaleidoscope effects with Lady Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] (2011) and finished her review by writing, [...] "ultimately, the clip shows the diva doesn't need the elaborate costumes, club-anthem rhythms and booty-quivering grooves to bring the heat. But a lustrous, fling-ready mane is always handy." [...] Similarly, a writer for MTV UK praised the video's [...] "light effects and symmetrical camera tricks" [...] which [...] " [...] sex as art". Leah Collins of the Canadian magazine Dose commented that Beyoncé was [...] "gifted with seemingly supernatural powers of hotness" [...] in the video. A writer for Rolling Stone found the video for [...] "1+1" [...] to be [...] "the moistest music video ever made", adding that it [...] "perfectly matches the sultry, romantic tone of the song". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice found a [...] "'What D'Angelo's 'Untitled (How Does It Feel)' Feels Like For A Girl' vibe" [...] in the video for [...] "1+1" [...] and compared it to the one for [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] (2009).|$|E

5000|$|Morris's {{interview}} style, that of <b>the</b> subject <b>staring</b> directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> camera, {{led to a}} later invention {{that his}} wife termed [...] "the Interrotron". It was first used in Fast Cheap and Out of Control (1997), and places Morris behind a curtain <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> a camera, which feeds into a teleprompter-like device that the interviewee can interact with. The interviewee, therefore, looks directly at Morris, and the camera.|$|R
