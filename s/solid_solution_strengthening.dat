50|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>strengthening</b> also {{increases}} the CRSS {{compared to a}} pure single component material because the solute atoms distort the lattice, preventing the dislocation motion necessary for plasticity.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the development of microstructure and variations in chemical composition in commercial Inconel 625 coatings on a ferritic-pearlitic steel overlaid by the CMT method. The investigation showed that microsegregation occurring during the weld overlay solidification makes the dendrite cores to be richer in Ni, Fe and Cr and the interdendritic regions in Mo and Nb. Niobium shows the strongest tendency to segregation during solidification; molybdenum tends to segregate less and chromium has the lowest tendency to segregation.

50|$|Nevertheless, {{one should}} not add so much solute as to {{precipitate}} a new phase.

50|$|Note {{that two}} {{different}} heat treatments involving precipitates {{can alter the}} strength of a material: solution heat treating and precipitation heat treating. <b>Solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>strengthening</b> involves formation of a single-phase solid solution via quenching.

In-phase cycling was defined as tensile deformation associated with high temperature and compressive deformation with low temperature, while out-of-phase thermal cycling {{was defined as the}} reverse case.

50|$|Surface carburizing, or case hardening, is {{one example}} of <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>strengthening</b> in which the density of solute carbon atoms is {{increased}} close {{to the surface of the}} steel, resulting in a gradient of carbon atoms throughout the material.

50|$|Inconel 625 was {{designed}} as a <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>strengthened</b> material with no significant microstructure. This holds true at low and high temperatures, but there is a region (923 to 1148 K) where precipitates form that are detrimental to the creep properties, and thus the strength, of the alloy. Under any creep conditions (high temperature with an applied stress), M23C6-type carbides form at the grain boundaries. When tested at 973 K, γ” precipitates begin forming. These γ” phase precipitates are ordered A3 B type with a composition of Ni3(Nb, Al, Ti) and a tetragonal crystal structure. They form a disk-shaped morphology and are coherent with respect to the matrix. When tested at 998 K, a δ-phase precipitate begins forming which consist of Ni3(Nb, Mo) in a orthorhombic crystal structure. They form in a needle-like morphology and are incoherent with the matrix. Both of these precipitates can be completely dissolved back into the matrix when the sample is heated 1148 K. This leads to the ability to recover creep properties of the alloy to prolong the materials lifetime.|$|R

An overview of wrought Nickel-base superalloy is presented. Starting with thin sheets the alloy will be aluminized and homogenized. The research from this study will determine the parameters for the movement of the phase boundaries, mass transport, and the time variant concentration fields for both the aluminization and homogenization processes. This is predictable for both single dimension fluxes assuming the interdiffusivities and fluxes at the phase boundaries are known. Because mass-transport is related to the movement of the phase boundaries through density, an investigation into the less dense aluminum-rich coatings and resultant matrix is also included...|$|R
50|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>strengthening</b> {{is a type}} of {{alloying}} {{that can}} be used to improve the strength of a pure metal. The technique works by adding atoms of one element (the alloying element) to the crystalline lattice of another element (the base metal), forming a solid solution. The local nonuniformity in the lattice due to the alloying element makes plastic deformation more difficult by impeding dislocation motion. In contrast, alloying beyond the solubility limit can form a second phase, leading to strengthening via other mechanisms (e.g. the precipitation of intermetallic compounds).|$|E
50|$|Substitutional <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>strengthening</b> {{occurs when}} the solute atom is large enough that it can replace solvent atoms in their lattice positions. Some {{alloying}} elements are only soluble in small amounts, whereas some solvent and solute pairs form a solution over {{the whole range of}} binary compositions. Generally, higher solubility is seen when solvent and solute atoms are similar in atomic size (15% according to the Hume-Rothery rules) and adopt the same crystal structure in their pure form. Examples of completely miscible binary systems are Cu-Ni and the Ag-Au face-centered cubic (FCC) binary systems, and the Mo-W body-centered cubic (BCC) binary system.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>strengthening,</b> a soluble {{alloying}} element {{is added to}} the material desired to be strengthened, and together they form a “solid solution”.

Depending {{on the size of the}} dissolved {{alloying element}}'s ion compared to that of the matrix-metal, it is dissolved either substitutionally (large alloying element substituting for an atom in the crystal) or interstitially (small alloying element taking a place between atoms in the crystal lattice). In both cases, the size difference of the foreign elements make them act as sand grains in sandpaper, resisting dislocations that try to slip by, resulting in higher material strength. In solution hardening, the alloying element does not precipitate from solution.|$|E

Low gamma-prime fraction nickel-based superalloys, such as IN 617, {{are becoming increasingly}} important in substituting for conventional steel components due to their better performance at higher temperatures. The aim of this work is to model the microstructural evolution in this alloy under typical operating conditions and relate this to its creep response. Although classified as <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>strengthened</b> alloys, they contain a range of different precipitates which contribute to the creep resistance, the most influential of these being gamma prime. The model is developed in three stages. Firstly, a precipitate-level variational model is derived to describe the nucleation and growth of individual particles and their interactions. The results are then passed up to a grain-level simulation where the response of a statistically significant particle ensemble is simulated via the evolution of particle distributions. The resulting model incorporates the effects of heat treatment and stress to give the simultaneous size and number evolution of the different phases in the material. This information is then used to construct plastic strain-temperature-time diagrams in order to estimate the creep rupture life of the material...|$|R

The theory portion of this thesis consists of a literature survey that focuses on cast iron metallurgy, ductile iron melt processes and cooling curve analysis of cast irons. The experimental part of this thesis consists of two production trials of 600 – 10 ductile iron and several linked cooling curve analyses and solidification simulations. The production trials were not completely successful. Different separately cast tensile test bars showed properties above and below standard requirements.

The effect of grain size in creep strength and creep rate comes through the grain boundary sliding mechanism.

40|$|Although {{typically}} {{thought of}} as a <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>strengthened</b> material, Alloy 625 is susceptible to significant precipitation hardening through the formation of γʺ (D 022) precipitates. These particles can form both during manufacture and in high temperature service and, consequently, the accurate prediction of their behaviour is crucial. To this end, a model is developed in this work which describes γʺ precipitation in Alloy 625, encompassing the concurrent homogeneous nucleation, growth and coarsening of different particles and allowing for them to be shape changing. Based on the Svoboda-Fischer-Fratzl-Kozeschnik (SFFK) framework, the model is calibrated with respect to experimental measurements of aspect ratio evolution at 650 °C, with the statistics were acquired through a novel analysis methodology. The outputs generated by the model for interfacial energy, particle size distribution and number density are in excellent agreement with experimental data for a simulation of 1000 hours at 650 °C, however beyond this point a divergence is introduced by the phenomenon of precipitate “encounter" (described by Davis et al. [1]). Following suitable changes for descriptions including precipitation driving force and material elastic constants, application of the model to the evolution of γʺ precipitates in Alloy 718 at 700 °C measured by Han et al. [2] reveals reasonable agreement. Whilst the results presented in this paper are predicated on a homogeneous microstructure and the formation of exclusively γʺ precipitates, the underlying frame work outlined is flexible enough for inhomogeneous and competitive precipitation to be included at a later date. Furthermore, through the application of an addition class management mechanism the model is likely applicable to a large range of ageing temperatures and durations...|$|R
