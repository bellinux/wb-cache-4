5000|$|A metalsmith {{or simply}} {{smith is a}} {{craftsman}} fashioning useful items (for example, tools, kitchenware, tableware, jewellery, and weapons) out of various metals. [...] Smithing {{is one of the}} oldest metalworking occupations. <b>Shaping</b> <b>metal</b> with a hammer (forging) is the archetypical component of smithing. Often the hammering is done while the metal is hot, having been heated in a forge. Smithing can also involve the other aspects of metalworking, such as refining metals from their ores (traditionally done by smelting), casting it into shapes (founding), and filing to shape and size.|$|E

50|$|Forging is also {{referred}} to as sculpting because it is the process of <b>shaping</b> <b>metal.</b> Some of the operations or techniques applied in forging to include drawing, shrinking, bending, upsetting and punching. Drawing can be accomplished with a variety of tools and methods. Two typical methods using only hammer and anvil would be hammering on the anvil horn, and hammering on the anvil face using the cross peen of a hammer. Another method for drawing is to use a tool called a fuller (tsinke), or the peen of the hammer to hasten the drawing out of a thick piece of metal. The technique is called fullering from the tool. Fullering consist of hammering a series of indentations (with corresponding ridge) perpendicular to the long section of the piece being drawn. The resulting effect will be to look somewhat like waves {{along the top of the}} piece.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{electromechanical}} force densities associated with pulsed electromagnetic fields in inhomogeneous, linear media with conductive losses, {{in the context of}} a process of <b>shaping</b> <b>metal</b> objects. We show that the conductivity and the gradients in permittivity and in permeability lead to volume forces, while jump discontinuities in permittivity and permeability lead to surface forces. These electromagnetic forces are assumed to act as volume (body) source densities in the elastodynamic equations and as surface source densities in the corresponding boundary conditions that govern the elastic motion of deformable matter. As an example, we apply the theory to the calculation of the elastic field in a hollow cylindrical object made of a conducting magnetic or nonmagnetic material. We compare the numerical results with those for the classical theory of elasticity with concentrated forces on the boundaries of the material as the source of the elastodynamic field...|$|E

Thixoforming involves <b>shaping</b> <b>metal</b> components in the semi-solid state. Two different steels have been thixoformed. Firstly, an M 2 tool steel and secondly a high performance steel HP 9 / 4 / 30. The M 2 tool steel is supplied in the GFM hot forged state (with tempering at 700 °C and annealing at 860 °C). The HP 9 / 4 / 30 is received as hot rolled ingot which {{has been subjected to}} a commercial heat treatment. In both cases, the steel is then directly thixoformed from the as-supplied state; there is no additional intermediate step to obtain a structure such that, in the semi-solid state, the microstructure will be spheroidal. In both cases, the material has been successfully thixoformed...|$|E

Thixoforming involves <b>shaping</b> <b>metal</b> components in the semi-solid state. Work on the thixoforming of high temperature materials, such as steel, is still at its initial stage; this is mainly due to the high processing temperatures involved {{and the potential for}} oxidation. For thixoforming to be possible, it is preferable for an alloy to have an appreciable melting range and before forming the microstructure must ideally consist of solid metal spheroids in a liquid matrix. This paper discusses the thixoforming load versus displacement curves of HP 9 / 4 / 30 steel semi-solid slugs under compression. The data from the corresponding load-displacement curves is converted into viscosity against shear rate adopting Stefan’s equation for flow between two parallel planes. The viscosity at processing conditions, i. e. at processing temperatures in the range of 1470 to 1480 °C and zero to two minutes soak times, showed a rapid decrease initially, which corresponds to a rapid breakdown in the structure, followed by a steady decrease to a near constant value with increasing rate. The work shows pseudoplasticity (or shear-thinning) behaviour of the HP 9 / 4 / 30 semi-solid slurries. This data would be required for modeling the die fill with these slurries...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{examples of}} applications for metal composite materials on Al matrix reinforced with ceramic {{particles in the}} form of grains, fibre or whiskers in the automotive industry. Highlighted are the advantages and drawbacks of such composite materials and issues involved in shaping complete parts. Presence of hard and brittle ceramic particles in the Al alloy (given their sufficient concentration) significantly impacts on the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the material and its suitability for shaping complete parts and constituting a surface layer (SL) with required properties. In making metal composite materials of Al alloys, various (including the latest) methods of casting are applied, often in combination with press molding in semi-fluid state, as well as powder metallurgy (P/M) methods. The final machining of functionally significant surfaces is done by machining (by all ways and variants). With presence of more than 5 % (by volume) ceramic reinforcing particles it becomes necessary to use cutting blades of the so-called super hard materials, including composites of polycristalline diamond and diamond. This considerably increases manufacturing costs. Electrical discharge machining has proved to be an effective way for <b>shaping</b> <b>metal</b> parts, in all its variants: sinker (EDM), wire erosion (WEDM), micromachining (μEDM), shaping by free electrode (REDM), discharge grinding (AEDM) and other.
