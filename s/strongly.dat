5|$|Two {{vertices}} in a {{directed graph}} {{are said to}} be <b>strongly</b> connected to each other if there is a directed path {{from one to the other}} and vice versa. This is an equivalence relation, and the vertices of the graph may be partitioned into <b>strongly</b> connected components, subsets within which every two vertices are <b>strongly</b> connected. There are several efficient linear time algorithms for finding the <b>strongly</b> connected components of a graph, based on depth first search: Tarjan's <b>strongly</b> connected components algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm each perform a single depth first search. Kosaraju's algorithm performs two depth first searches, but is very simple.|$|E
5|$|A late {{proponent of}} the style was the German Thiofrid of Echternach, abbot of Echternach between 1083 and 1110, who was <b>strongly</b> {{influenced}} by Aldhelm.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} rest of the British Isles and Scotland, Rùm {{features}} a <b>strongly</b> maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters.|$|E
5|$|Astrology {{features}} <b>strongly</b> in Eleanor Catton's The Luminaries, {{recipient of}} the 2013 Man Booker Prize.|$|E
5|$|C# {{supports}} <b>strongly</b> typed implicit variable declarations {{with the}} keyword var, and implicitly typed arrays with the keyword new {{followed by a}} collection initializer.|$|E
5|$|Catatonia is {{no longer}} so <b>strongly</b> {{associated}} with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Check {{whether any}} <b>strongly</b> {{connected}} component contains both a variable and its negation. If so, {{report that the}} instance is not satisfiable and halt.|$|E
5|$|Construct the {{implication}} graph of the instance, and find its <b>strongly</b> connected components using {{any of the}} known linear-time algorithms for strong connectivity analysis.|$|E
5|$|Electron {{mobility}} of ZnO <b>strongly</b> varies with temperature {{and has a}} maximum of ~2000cm2/(V·s) at 80 K. Data on hole mobility are scarce with values in the range 5–30cm2/(V·s).|$|E
5|$|From 1937 to 1938, Monotype re-cut {{the type}} for modern-day usage, {{and it has}} become a popular book typeface. Ehrhardt has a {{slightly}} condensed design, giving it a <b>strongly</b> vertical, crisp appearance.|$|E
5|$|Getting a STI {{history from}} your current partner and <b>strongly</b> {{encouraging}} they be tested and treated before intercourse.|$|E
5|$|His {{gold medal}} {{provided}} him a scholarship for studying abroad. He visited Germany, Switzerland, France and in 1860 settled in Italy. In Rome he met Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov who <b>strongly</b> influenced Ge.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, writer Jeremy Stone {{alleged that}} Morrison {{had been the}} Soviet spy Perseus, a charge that Morrison <b>strongly</b> and credibly rebutted. Stone {{accepted}} his rebuttal.|$|E
5|$|In December 1951, President Truman {{nominated}} Kennan to be {{the next}} United States ambassador to the USSR. His appointment was endorsed <b>strongly</b> by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, Anders Behring Breivik, the man {{who carried}} out the 2011 Norway attacks, {{expressed}} admiration for Geert Wilders and the Party for Freedom. Wilders immediately distanced himself <b>strongly</b> from Breivik.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the {{implication}} graph, two literals {{belong to the same}} <b>strongly</b> connected component whenever there exist chains of implications from one literal to the other and vice versa. Therefore, the two literals must have the same value in any satisfying assignment to the given 2-satisfiability instance. In particular, if a variable and its negation both belong to the same <b>strongly</b> connected component, the instance cannot be satisfied, because it is impossible to assign both of these literals the same value. As Aspvall et al. showed, this is a necessary and sufficient condition: a 2-CNF formula is satisfiable if and only if there is no variable that belongs to the same <b>strongly</b> connected component as its negation.|$|E
5|$|It also {{provides}} a powerful toolkit for studying <b>strongly</b> coupled quantum field theories. Much of {{the usefulness of the}} duality results {{from the fact that it}} is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are <b>strongly</b> interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.|$|E

5|$|Judah started <b>strongly</b> {{and put up}} a valiant fight, {{at times}} {{matching}} Mayweather's speed and punching precision.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{radio and}} {{particle}} emissions are <b>strongly</b> modulated by its rotation, {{which makes the}} planet somewhat similar to a pulsar. This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment {{with respect to the}} rotational axis as well as by high-latitude magnetic anomalies. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions {{is similar to that of}} radio pulsars. They differ only in the scale, and Jupiter can be considered a very small radio pulsar too. In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions <b>strongly</b> depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on solar activity.|$|E
5|$|Malabar {{chestnut}} (Pachira aquatica), have a taste {{reminiscent of}} peanuts when raw, and of cashews or European chestnuts (which they <b>strongly</b> resemble) when roasted.|$|E
5|$|Michael Keaton as Chick Hicks, {{described}} by Pixar as a generic 1980s stock car. <b>Strongly</b> resembles a 1978–88 General Motors G-Body {{such as a}} Buick Regal or Chevrolet Monte Carlo.|$|E
5|$|One of Snedden's first actions was to readdress the paper's {{stance on}} Alaska statehood. Lathrop and the News-Miner had been <b>strongly</b> opposed to statehood, but after Snedden took control, he {{analyzed}} {{the issue and}} came out <b>strongly</b> in favor of Alaska statehood. The News-Miner continually published editorials in favor of statehood, and encouraged other newspapers across the U.S. to do the same. In 1955 and 1956, when the Alaska Constitutional Convention {{took place at the}} University of Alaska Fairbanks, the News-Miner set up special telephone lines from the convention chambers to the newspaper's office. Daily reports were printed, recording the delegates' progress.|$|E

5|$|Pistachio oil, a <b>strongly</b> flavored {{oil with}} a {{distinctive}} green color.|$|E
5|$|Robert Lambourne regards Forward, {{especially}} in Dragon's Egg, as the successor of Hal Clement, whose Mission of Gravity exemplifies the most <b>strongly</b> science-based science fiction. In Lambourne's opinion hard science fiction authors like Clement, Forward and their successors {{have been relatively}} few but have <b>strongly</b> influenced both the genre's evolution and the public's perception of the genre.|$|E
5|$|Sabah has {{abundant}} natural resources, and {{its economy}} is <b>strongly</b> export-oriented. Its primary exports include oil, gas, timber and palm oil. The other major industries are agriculture and ecotourism.|$|E
5|$|Since the pigeye shark so <b>strongly</b> {{resembles the}} bull shark, morphology-based phylogenetic studies have {{considered}} the two species to be closely related. Neither this nor any other arrangement is <b>strongly</b> supported by molecular phylogenetic research, which to date has been inconclusive regarding this shark's evolutionary relationship to other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gemsbok, sable antelope, and Grant's gazelle, are camouflaged with <b>strongly</b> {{disruptive}} facial markings that {{conceal the}} highly recognisable eye. Many species, such as gazelles, may be made to look flat, and hence to blend into the background, by countershading. The outlines of many bovids are broken up with bold disruptive colouration, the <b>strongly</b> contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators. However, all the Hippotraginae (including the gemsbok) have pale bodies and faces with conspicuous markings. The zoologist Tim Caro describes this as difficult to explain, but given that the species are diurnal, he suggests that the markings may function in communication. <b>Strongly</b> contrasting leg colouration is common only in the Bovidae, where for example Bos, Ovis, bontebok and gemsbok have white stockings. Again, communication is the likely function.|$|E
5|$|Specter <b>strongly</b> opposed most gun control, {{voting against}} the Brady Bill, {{background}} checks at gun shows, {{the ban on}} assault weapons, and trigger locks for handguns.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Light Horse Brigade and Patiala Infantry, (Chaytor's Force) {{advanced}} on 20 September eastwards {{across the}} Jordan Valley toward the <b>strongly</b> entrenched Shunet Nimrin position, and Derbasi on the Ottoman left flank. The 6th Light Horse and 7th Light Horse Regiments, {{with a company}} of Patiala Infantry, were shelled by guns from El Haud {{in the foothills of}} Moab as they moved across the valley. Positions east of the Jordan River, including Mellaha, continued to be <b>strongly</b> held by Fourth Army units.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} soil in Leonard Harrison State Park {{is somewhat}} excessively drained Oquaga channery loam, {{which is often}} associated with well drained Lordstown channery loam. Much of the campground near the eastern boundary is supported by Morris gravelly silt loam, which is somewhat poorly drained due to a subsoil fragipan. The Oquaga tends to be very <b>strongly</b> acidic (pH 4.8), Morris is <b>strongly</b> acidic (pH 5.3) and Lordstown is moderately acidic (pH 5.5). All of these soils belong to the Inceptisol soil order.|$|E
