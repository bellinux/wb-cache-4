We examine empirically the determinants of credit line usage with a large database of Spanish corporate credit lines. Our datasource is the credit register maintained by the Banco de España, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> and primary banking supervisory agency. Known as the Central de Información de Riesgos (CIR), the dataset contains information on any loan commitment above € 6, 000 granted by any bank operating in Spain since 1984. We find that a variety of line-specific, borrower-specific and lender-specific characteristics as well as general economic conditions influence credit line use. The default status of the credit line is found to be the primary factor driving credit line usage, and this effect increases as the firm approaches default. Another influential factor seems to be an aging effect in which firms reduce their usage as the line ages. We find robust evidence that riskier firms, as suggested by their defaulting on their credit commitments, use their credit lines more intensively than firms that do not default. Several lender characteristics, such as the nature of the banking relationship and the type of bank, als...|$|E
40|$|In {{relation}} to the latest economic crisis much {{attention was paid to}} the bank capital requirements. Many papers discuss the pro-cyclical effect of these capital requirements and the options of how to stabilize the banking industry and financial system. In this thesis I researched another instrument which can cause the pro-cyclical effect - the loan loss provisions. In reaction to this issue the <b>Spanish</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> has adopted the model of dynamic provisioning which acts counter-cyclically. This model is supposed to balance the amount of created provisions and banks' profit over the time. In this thesis I introduce a hypothetical situation in which the countries using the Euro currency adopted the model of dynamic provisioning and I examine the hypothesis that the adoption of this model would mitigate the latest economic crisis as the banks would achieve higher profits during the time of recession. Based on the conducted research I confirmed my hypothesis and conclude that the dynamic provisioning would balance the economic swings. However, the results also showed that the set-up of dynamic provisions model is crucial. In order to make the model efficient the model coefficients have to be precisely determined by central banks or individual banks and approved by independent supervisors. Keywords [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Since the Spanish Government {{passed the}} "Central Bank Independence Law", The Sasp <b>Spanish</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Bank,</b> {{in order to}} form part of the European Central Bank (ECB) in the future EMU, has {{recently}} changed its monetary policy framework. Nowadays the Spanish policy monetary authority has an especific and main duty: :succeed in maintaining the prices under control. From then on, the term structure of interest rates (TSIR) is an important indicator of future inflation {{as well as a}} key variable to understand the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. So, the study of the term structure of interest rates has became an especially and lively topic for economists. The growing importance of the TSIR has demanded our attention. The main aim of this work is to analyse if the Spanish TSIR is determined by the foreign term structure. In order to, the study has structured as follows: in the 1 st. section the concept and importance of TS are introduced; in the 2 nd. throug a set of indicators, it is demonstrated that the Spanish capital market, engaged in a EMU project, presents a high degree of linking with other capital markets, especially with european capital markets. The 4 th. section is devoted to test statiscally the hypothesis, based on the Exogenesi theory, that the Spanish TSIR is determined, in large measure by the German term structure. Finally, in the last section the main conclusions. are presented. ...|$|E
40|$|The 2004 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Accord (known as Basel II) {{provides}} a common framework for banks {{to determine their}} minimum capitalrequirements for solvency purposes. For credit risk (the most important one for banking) Basel II uses an asymptotic single risk factor (ASRF) model and, as we demonstrate in the paper, assumes two fundamental hypotheses: Firstly, {{that there is only}} one risk factor common to all banks; and secondly, that the number of debtors in bank portfolios is high enough to ensure that no single debtor’s behaviour can have a significant impact on the portfolio value as a whole. This allows capitalrequirements to be estimated by using amodel based on the percentage of defaulting borrowers (x). The model only requires values for two variables: the probability of default and loss if default occurs. Using a 99 % likelihood and assuming that all sectors are equally correlated, the model estimates x through the cumulative distribution function for the Gaussian distribution. But many bank portfolios do not fit these hypotheses, and therefore the ASRF model underestimates actual capitalrequirements. Thus, a surcharge for concentrationrisk is required. There are two kinds of concentrationrisk (sector and name concentrationrisk), each one corresponding to the violation of one of the above mentioned hypotheses. Supervisory authorities are currently developing models to incorporate this surcharge into banking solvency rules. In Spain, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> bases its surcharge proposal for sectorial concentration on the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI). In this paper we show that HHI treats all sectors as equally risky and propose an alternative index (CI) in which sectors are weighted according to risk. Moreover, our index also incorporates the relations between each pair of sectors (in the HHI framework no sectorial relationship is considered). Our proposal is based on an adjusted variance–covariance matrix, in which negative covariances have been equalled to 0. We demonstrate the HHI is a particular case of our proposed index, by means of simplifying hypotheses. As we will show, the proposed index has two fundamental properties: it is lower and upper bounded; and it decreases as concentration and/or risk decreases. These properties allow the index to be incorporated into bank risk management models. In this way bank estimations can improve upon those based on the supervisory model and, according to banking rules, can also be used for determining the capital surcharge for sectorial concentration...|$|E

40|$|The {{endogenous}} {{theory of}} money, developed by Basil Moore, {{argues that the}} supply of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money in modern economies is not {{under the control of}} the <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> According to this view, a <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> typically supplies cash reserves automatically on demand at its minimum lending rate, resulting in a clearly horizontal money supply function. While the paper agrees with Moore that the supply of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money cannot be determined exogenously by the <b>central</b> <b>bank,</b> it wonders whether the supply is determined completely by the demand of the commercial banks.
