40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we present some new <b>limit</b> <b>theorems</b> for power {{variation}} of kth order increments of stationary increments Lévy driven moving averages. In this infill sampling setting, the asymptotic theory gives very surprising results, which (partially) have no counterpart {{in the theory}} of discrete moving averages. More specifically, we will show that the first order <b>limit</b> <b>theorems</b> and the mode of convergence strongly depend on the interplay between the given order of the increments, the considered power p > 0, the Blumenthal–Getoor index β ∈ (0, 2) of the driving pure jump Lévy process L and the behaviour of the kernel function g at 0 determined by the power α. First order asymptotic theory essentially comprise three cases: stable convergence towards a certain infinitely divisible distribution, an ergodic type <b>limit</b> <b>theorem</b> and convergence in probability towards an integrated random process. We also prove the <b>second</b> order <b>limit</b> <b>theorem</b> connected to the ergodic type result. When the driving Lévy process L is a symmetric β-stable process we obtain two different limits: a central <b>limit</b> <b>theorem</b> and convergence in distribution towards a (1 − α) β-stable random variable...|$|R
40|$|Random Fisher {{matrices}} arise {{naturally in}} multivariate statistical analysis {{and understanding the}} properties of its eigenvalues is of primary importance for many hypothesis testing problems like testing the equality between two covariance matrices, or testing the independence between sub-groups of a multivariate random vector. Most of the existing work on random Fisher matrices deals with a particular situation where the population covariance matrices are equal. In this paper, we consider general Fisher matrices with arbitrary population covariance matrices and develop their spectral properties when the dimensions are proportionally large compared to the sample size. The paper has two main contributions: first the limiting distribution of the eigenvalues of a general Fisher matrix is found and <b>second,</b> a central <b>limit</b> <b>theorem</b> is established for a wide class of functionals of these eigenvalues. Applications of the main results are also developed for testing hypotheses on high-dimensional covariance matrices. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} Law of Large Numbers and Central <b>Limit</b> <b>Theorem</b> for certain probabilistic system with estimated rate of convergence. The underlying probability space on which results are constructed {{is determined by}} the Entropy, which is a number of configurations of system which can occur for given state. The sample space is a lattice of rational numbers and represents the system states. Probability mass function of particular state is obtained by normalizing the Entropy of considered state by the sum of Entropies of all states. The Entropy has a unique maximum for considered lattice and several other technical properties. As the system grows, i. e. its certain parameter increases, the Entropies increases and the lattice becomes denser. The first result of the paper gives the mean state as systems size tends to infinity. The <b>second</b> result, Central <b>Limit</b> <b>Theorem,</b> depends on the type of maximum of entropy. When maximum is in the interior of the lattice the fluctuation converges to Gaussian distribution. In case the maximum is on the boundary of the domain the distribution is a discrete in the direction orthogonal to the boundary of lattice on which maximum is situated and Gaussian in other directions. Additionally, for each result we provide the rate of convergence of the system to the resulting distribution. The proof consists of several approximations developed specially for this paper. The main are the Laplace type approximation but with sum instead of integrals and several other but rather standard approximations. Comment: 40 page...|$|R
