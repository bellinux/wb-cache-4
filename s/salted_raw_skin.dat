40|$|Abstract:- In {{the leather}} sector {{different}} types of finished leather products are prepared from <b>raw</b> <b>salted</b> <b>skins.</b> About 130 {{different types of}} chemicals are used in leather manufacturing ranging from common salt (sodium chloride) to the very expensive chrome sulphate. The chrome tanning process is widely employed in many countries including tanneries in Zimbabwe. Many chemicals are used to prepare hides for tanning, and after use these chemicals {{find their way into}} the environment. All three categories of waste, i. e. gaseous, liquid and solid are generated from the tanneries. This paper seeks to address the environmental pollution problems at a leather manufacturing company in Zimbabwe. An essential part of such a new approach is the concept of Cleaner Production (CP), an integrated preventative strategy aimed at minimising waste and improving the efficiency of processes, products and services. <b>Raw</b> <b>salted</b> <b>skins</b> are mainly used in Zimbabwe and these result in many salts finding their way in the tanneries effluent. This research was therefore mainly concerned with salt reduction in the effluents by incorporating a chilling unit to the tannery though they are many Cleaner Production options in the leather manufacturing industry...|$|R

40|$|What {{the present}} paper deals with, of chiefly the researching-results {{concerning}} the properties of shark-skin put under the tanning process. ""I. Effect of liming on the fish-skin. The amount of the nitrogenous compounds dissolved out into the lime-water from the shark-skin in the liming, increased in parallel with the time of liming, with no relation with the volume of lime-water. The amount of ammonia-N and amide-N dissolved out from the shark-skin was about two {{times as much as}} that from the cattle hide. The contents of amide-N and diamino-N in the limed shark-skin were less than those of <b>raw</b> <b>skin,</b> while the contents of mono amino-Nshowed increasing tendency. ""The detection of almost every kind of amino acid was possible in the lime-water used for liming. In general, the amino acids in the shark-skin dissolved out faster than those in the cattle-hide. Glycine, aspartic acid and alanine were apt to become free from the skin. The release existence of proline and hydroxyproline suggesting the decomposition of collagen was obserbed revealed in case of the shark-skin on the 7 th and 10 th day in the liming, while in case of the cattle-hide it was marked on the 17 th day weakly. The contents of hydroxyproline and arginine in the shark-skin decreased and those in the lime-water increased gradually, after the 7 th day. Accordingly, it was clarified that the liming of shark-skin should be kept in the peried from 7 to 10 days at about 23 °C. Before the occurrence of rapid decrease in the contents of hydroxyproline in the limed skin collagen, no change the hydrothermal shrinking temperature (Ts) could be observed. Ts. of limed skin and that of delimed skin were observed to be not so high as that of <b>raw</b> <b>skin,</b> but Ts. of leather was always considerably higher than that of <b>raw</b> <b>skin.</b> From the above mentioned resalts it was presumed that the liming process should haveconsiderable effects on the skin, namely, the removal of unavilable protein; the swell and exposure of collagen; the increase of reactivity of skin to tan agent and the elevation of Ts. of leather. In addition, it was confirmed that the day sneeded for the liming of shark-skin were far shorter than those for cattle hide. ""II. Changes of lipid in fish-skin. The changes in the contents of lipid in the skin under the tanning process, especially the pickling process, were studied, mainly, with blue-fin-tuna-skin having much lipid. Lipid contents in the skin under the liming process decreased in parallel with the time of liming. Only about 15...|$|R
