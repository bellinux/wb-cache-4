In this work we assessed the viability of implementing the <b>separate</b> <b>collection</b> of biowaste targeting restaurants and canteens in city centers, using Aveiro as a case study. The current situation (no <b>separate</b> <b>collection</b> for biowaste) was compared with an alternative scenario in which biowaste was separately collected and valorized.

40|$|Abstract: The {{planning}} {{actions in}} {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) management must follow strategies aimed at obtaining economies of scale. At the regional basin, a proper feasibility analysis of treatment and disposal plants {{should be based on}} the collection and analysis of data available on production rate and technological characteristics of waste. Considering the regulations constraint, the energy recovery is limited by the creation of small or medium-sized incineration plants, while <b>separated</b> <b>collection</b> strongly influences the heating value of the residual MSW. Moreover, <b>separated</b> <b>collection</b> of organic fraction in non-densely populated area is burdensome and difficult to manage. The paper shows the results of the analysis carried out to evaluate the potential energy recovery using a combined cycle for the incineration of mechanically pre-treated MSW in Basilicata, a non-densely populated region in Southern Italy. In order to focalize the role of sieving as pre-treatment, the evaluation on the MSW sieved fraction heating value was presented. Co-generative (heat and power production) plant was compared to other MSW management solutions (e. g., direct landfilling), also considering the environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was twofold: on the one hand, we analyse the results {{achieved}} in terms of percentages of <b>separate</b> <b>collection</b> in Italy by testing the effectiveness of Legislative Decree 152 / 2006 in improving the <b>separate</b> <b>collection</b> process; on the other hand, we investigate on some of the factors, related to the sociocultural local context, that could explain the different impacts of the law in the three macro-areas considered (North, Central and South Italy). To this purpose, an econometric analysis on the Italian regions for the 1996 – 2013 period is performed, comparing the period before (1996 – 2006) and after (2006 – 2013) the date of entry into force of the new law. The results show the effectiveness of Legislative Decree 152 / 2006 in promoting <b>separate</b> <b>collection,</b> although a regional difference in terms of <b>separate</b> <b>collection</b> rate is observed. Northern regions proved to be more dynamic and reactive to the above-mentioned legislation, while Central and especially Southern regions achieved poorer results in moving to higher <b>separate</b> waste <b>collection</b> rates. Finally, our work provides evidence on some local factors that may have hampered an effective policy implementation in Southern regions, among them, the presence of criminal activities and the lack of citizen participation in politics...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of integrated systems far {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) management has underlined the need far the simultaneous use {{of a variety of}} options in the collection, treatment and disposal of different waste components. In order {{to take into account the}} possible consequences that each option might have on the others in an integrated system, decisional mathematical models are employed so as to optimise the flows of solid waste collected in a number of different ways and diverted to treatment plants. The model is based on a representation of the integrated system as a network of nodes and lines, and is described using mass and energy balance. Waste flows along the lines are considered the unknowns of the model and are calculated by minimising total network management costs. Environmental, social and technical constraints are also included and the application of the model for solid waste flow optimisation in Campania Region (Italy) is presented. Following the indications of the regional programme, two territorial areas for municipal solid waste management are defined, and four different scenarios are investigated for each of them. Each scenario refers to a fixed objective of material recovery from source <b>separated</b> <b>collection</b> and corresponds to a successive phase of waste management programme application. Source <b>separated</b> <b>collection</b> of miscellaneous organic waste from specific producers and source <b>separated</b> <b>collection</b> of glass, metals, paper and plastic from domestic producers are considered, together with commingled solid waste collection from both specific and domestic producers. In compliance with the provisions of the regional programme, the following treatment facilities and final disposal sites are envisaged: composting plants located near the production centres for the treatment of source separated waste coming from specific producers; material recovery facilities for the treatment of commingled solid waste in order to produce RDF and stabilise the biodegradable organic fraction; incinerators with energy recovery capability, where RDF coming from material recovery facilities is burned; sanitary landfills for the final disposal of ashes produced by incineration plants and other residues. The preferred options for collection, treatment and disposal of each MSW component and the required capacities of treatment plants and disposal sites are derived. The results obtained show several differences between the two considered territorial areas, due to the differing MSW composition. In the first area, source <b>separated</b> <b>collection</b> turns out to be appropriate only for materials having a low specific energy content: the others are source separately collected only in order to reach the minimum assigned percentage of recovered materials far the considered scenario. In the second territorial area, the minimum percentage of recovered materials that can justify the cost of source <b>separated</b> <b>collection</b> is 38 %: this percentage also includes a certain quantity of paper and plastics. The total energy recovered varies in the considered scenarios because of the fall in RDF production and its lower specific energy content. Similar results are also found far the production of ashes and residues. Finally a substantial reduction in the required capacity of treatment plants and disposal sites, especially far the first territorial area, is obtained by the successive application of the regional programme. The residual capacity can be then used for industrial waste...|$|E

Although absolute declining for waste generation {{is a long way}} off, there are some first signals of increasing relative delinking and robust average landfill diversion. Spatial effects seem to be negligible, probably due to the strong decentralisation of waste management and policies: local, economic, policy and structural factors contribute to explaining the waste dynamics. Though North-South waste performances are showing some signals of convergence, greater efforts towards convergence of waste performances in a decentralised policy scenario are needed.

In order to organize separate collection operations, complex decisions need to be taken on the basis of a large amount of data. In this paper, the problem of planning the door-to-door waste collection of multiple materials for a municipality is considered. A few contributions are available in the literature for this problem. A new mixed integer linear programming model is formalized and solved. A multiobjective optimization model is proposed, aiming at minimizing both operational costs and possible inefficiencies of the recycling logistic system causing negative environmental impacts. The model is applied to a real case study and a mixed integer programming heuristic algorithm is used for its solution. The obtained results are discussed and conclusions are drawn...|$|E

The case study on Italy is worth being considered provided that Italy is a main country in the EU, thus offering important pieces of information on the evaluation of policies. Evidence shows that the observed decoupling between economic growth and landfilling is driven by a mix of structural factors, as population density and waste management strategies. If on the one hand, the landfill tax is not arising as a significant driver of the phenomenon, other waste management instruments are associated with high significant negative effect on landfilled waste. In association to the features of the tariff system, we also underline the key role played by the share of <b>separated</b> <b>collection</b> in driving down landfilling of waste. Both the evolution of collection and tariff system are joint factors that may drive a wedge between the comparative waste performances of northern and southern regions. ...|$|E
