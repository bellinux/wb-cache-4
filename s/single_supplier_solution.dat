50|$|In theory, the PAX tire {{would not}} have the same {{proprietary}} issues that plagued the Michelin TRX tire that was introduced in the mid-1970s but died out in the 1980s. By licensing the PAX technology to other companies, Michelin would ensure that the consumer would not be locked into a single supplier as with the TRX. Pirelli, Goodyear, Toyo and Sumitomo have licensed the technology from Michelin, but these companies never came out with PAX system tires. So in reality, the consumer was still left with a <b>single</b> <b>supplier</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E

30|$|From a {{customer}} perspective, performance interoperability of biometric components is very important. Performance interoperability {{is an essential}} measure to ensure that biometric subsystems from different suppliers are capable of generating and comparing samples and to meet {{at the same time}} an absolute level of performance within some margin [22]. Interoperability performance results of biometric components/systems provide a better choice on selecting products and thus reduce dependency on a <b>single</b> <b>supplier.</b> The GUC 100 fingerprint database enables performance evaluation of not only components from a <b>single</b> <b>supplier</b> but also components from different suppliers in intra- and intersensor settings. Such interoperability can be viewed at two different processing levels which are image and minutiae template levels.|$|R
40|$|Building a {{long-term}} relationship by committing to source from a <b>single</b> <b>supplier</b> over time may place a buyer at a disadvantage. With commitment, the buyer foregoes the option of switching to a new supplier, which is beneficial if the efficiency improvement {{is greater than the}} associated costs of switching. On the other hand, competition among suppliers may increase if the buyer commits to source from the winning supplier over a long term, which is advantageous for the buyer. We consider the value of commitment in an environment where the supplier operates capacity that is owned by the buyer, the buyer faces uncertainty about the downstream market demand, and a supplier’s production cost is private information. The buyer thus uses buffer capacity to hedge against market uncertainty and a competitive bidding process to elicit a supplier’s cost. We analyze when the buyer should commit to source from a <b>single</b> <b>supplier</b> over a long term, and show that there exists a critical level of switching costs above which the buyer should commit to a <b>single</b> <b>supplier.</b> Furthermore, we find that with commitment, capacity can be either higher or lower than without commitment. Finally, we find that when market uncertainty increases, commitment is optimal over a wider range of switching costs. 1 1...|$|R

30|$|We {{considered}} three {{stage joint}} economic lot sizing {{model for a}} supply chain problem with <b>single</b> <b>supplier,</b> <b>single</b> manufacturer and <b>single</b> retailer.

The manufacturer produces the item in small cycles which includes imperfect items also. At the end of each cycle the imperfect items are accumulated and it is reworked by the manufacturer. Thus, ultimately the retailer receives the perfect quality item. The demand of the retailer is price and stock depended stochastic demand which depends on the customer’s choice. The amount of shipment from manufacturer to retailer depends on retailer’s demand which in turn depends on customer’s demand.|$|R
