The collected date was analyzed by chi-square, t-test, and paired t-test Pearson correlation coefficients.

The right touch can make us feel secure, happy, loved. But social taboos and new technologies often seem {{to get in the}} way of human contact. Many of our ordinary interactions with the world make poor use of our sense of touch. Using a computer keyboard, flicking a light switch or pushing a door provide few tactile rewards. However, designers are now creating novel objects that engage more playfully with the touch senses. Some explore unexpected materials combined with the other senses. Some reinvent how we use objects and technologies in order to produce more satisfying encounters. Some are even creating designs that aspire to promote richer human relationships. Touch Me is a V&A and Wellcome Trust exhibition. Many of the objects in Touch Me had been lent by international designers. Two items of mine were exhibited in the bedroom section of the exhibition with the invitation to 'PRESS ME': Sensitive Shoes LED shoes designed were made by Steve McIntyre for Dr Jenny Tillotson 2003.
