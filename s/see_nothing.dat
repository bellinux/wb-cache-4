5|$|We {{all feel}} as {{sensitive}} to satisfaction at times. We can look outside us and <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> but destruction, avarice, and boredom. So {{we look to}} find that love where we can find it. Some people look to Hollywood, some people look to Blackpool and {{the bright lights of}} Blackpool. That's probably where I would look.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} on the {{southern}} side of the Shangani was over, Forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson's party, but, unable to cross the river, could <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to tell them what}} had happened. Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn.|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could <b>see</b> <b>nothing.</b> Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E

5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Elsa befriends series protagonist Emma Swan, Emma and the series' central cast resolving the help Elsa find Anna. The group {{eventually}} discovers that a figure named the Snow Queen (a more faithful {{adaptation of the}} original fairy tale's character) is somehow responsible for Elsa's trapping in her urn, a woman with similar powers to Elsa. They soon discover that the Snow Queen is Elsa's aunt, Ingrid, who was forgotten from Arendelle when Elsa's mother, Gerda, used {{the power of the}} troll king to erase everyones memory of her, not wishing for the world to remember how Ingrid accidentally killed their third sister, Helga. Ingrid soon discovered a prophecy that stated she would one day have the love of her sisters again. With Ingrid's sisters dead however, she believed she would be forced to create new sisters. For this, she chose Emma and Elsa. Ingrid had stalked Emma her entire life in preparation for the prophecy to become true, and manipulated events in Arendelle to bring Elsa to her. Being convinced that she could only gain their love when {{she was the only one}} left, she obtained a mirror capable of bringing out the worst in people (the mirror coming directly from The Snow Queen fairy tale). If a piece of the mirror were to get in someones eye, they would <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> but hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on everyone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of its citizens to kill each other while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune. Ingrid had also used this to her advantage on Anna, forcing Anna to trap Elsa in the urn they originally found Elsa in.|$|E

25|$|Let us {{remember}} that we form a government for millions not yet in existence.... In the course {{of four or five}} hundred years, I do not know how it will work. This is most certain, that Papists may occupy that chair, and Mahometans may take it. I <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> against it.|$|E
25|$|A LifeWay Research poll {{conducted}} in August 2009 found that 61% of Americans born between 1980 and 1991 <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> wrong with two {{people of the}} same gender getting married while 39% disagree. The survey was conducted on a demographically representative survey of 1,200 U.S. adults between 18 and 29 years old.|$|E
25|$|Bohm's {{proposed}} implicate order applies both {{to matter}} and consciousness. He {{suggested that it}} could explain the relationship between them. He saw mind and matter as projections into our explicate order from the underlying implicate order.

25|$|The {{court is}} {{informed}} that the plaintiff in error {{is no longer in}} the service of the state. We <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> to be gained by prolonging the life of this bizarre case. On the contrary, we think that the peace and dignity of the state, which all criminal prosecutions are brought to redress, will be the better conserved by the entry of a nolle prosequi herein. Such a course is suggested to the Attorney General.|$|E
25|$|All of pagandom (Indians) {{is fond of}} {{the pueblo}} of Los Angeles, of the rancho of Reyes, and of the ditches (water system). Here we <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> but pagans, clad in shoes, with sombreros and blankets, and serving as muleteers to the {{settlers}} and rancheros, so {{that if it were}} not for the gentiles there would be neither pueblos nor ranches. These pagan Indians care neither for the missions nor for the missionaries.|$|E
25|$|The next {{hundred miles}} of grade from Reno to Colfax, California were {{by far the}} most {{challenging}} to build and provided the most impressive views of the whole route, although for much of that stretch passengers could <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> as trains traveled through miles of tunnels and snowsheds. After passing Verdi, Nevada, the site in November, 1870, of the first train robbery on the Pacific coast, the Overland Route crossed into California and followed the Truckee River up a picturesque canyon to the town of Truckee on Donner Lake where the ill-fated George Donner party had been snowbound in the winter of 1846–7.|$|E

25|$|Bill Cotton, the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment in the mid–1970s, {{said after}} the first series was {{produced}} that the show was {{a prime example of}} the BBC's relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> funny in them, but, trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, never would have let the programme get to the production stage {{on the basis of the}} scripts.|$|E
25|$|Blowfish's key {{schedule}} starts by initializing the P-array and S-boxes with values {{derived from}} the hexadecimal digits of pi, which contain no obvious pattern (<b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> up my sleeve number). The secret key is then, byte by byte, cycling the key if necessary, XORed with all the P-entries in order. A 64-bit all-zero block is then encrypted with the algorithm as it stands. The resultant ciphertext replaces P1 and P2. The same ciphertext is then encrypted again with the new subkeys, and the new ciphertext replaces P3 and P4. This continues, replacing the entire P-array and all the S-box entries. In all, the Blowfish encryption algorithm will run 521 times to generate all the subkeys - about 4KB of data is processed.|$|E
25|$|His father, brother, and a {{neighbour}} {{came out}} to look and Joseph immediately said he too could see the apparition although the adults saw nothing. The mother, Victoire, came out but she too could <b>see</b> <b>nothing.</b> The boys’ parents could not see what their children were seeing that night and called for Sister Vitaline, the local school teacher. She, like the boys’ parents, could also not see the apparition, and called for two girls, Françoise Richer and Jeanne-Marie Lebosse, aged nine and eleven. Sister Vitaline suggested that perhaps Our Lady was visible only to the children. Without any knowledge of the apparition, these two girls looked {{into the night sky}} and began describing Our Lady in the same exact detail as the Barbedette boys had described.|$|E

Well, he had fallen in with those who deem this same Mary our only lawful Queen, and would fain set her on the throne to bring back fire and faggot by the Spanish sword among us." ...|$|R

500|$|In late 1885 Watts's adopted {{daughter}} Blanche Clogstoun {{had just}} lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that [...] "I <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them." [...] Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in {{a society in which}} economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} March 1941, Hitler {{wanted the}} convoys {{supplying}} the British Expeditionary force in Greece stopped, and the Italian Navy was the only force able to attempt this. Cunningham stated in his biography: [...] "I myself was inclined {{to think that the}} Italians would not try anything. I bet Commander Power, the Staff Officer, Operations, the sum of ten shillings that we would <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> of the enemy." [...] Under pressure from Germany, the Italian Fleet planned to launch an attack on the British Fleet on 28 March 1941.|$|E
