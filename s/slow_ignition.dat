40|$|Organic {{aerosols}} (OA) {{derived from}} small-scale wood combustion emissions {{are not well}} represented by current emissions inventories and models, although they contribute substantially to the atmospheric particulate matter (PM) levels. In this work, a 29  m 3 smog chamber in the ILMARI facility of the University of Eastern Finland was utilized to investigate the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from a small-scale modern masonry heater commonly used in northern Europe. Emissions were oxidatively aged in the smog chamber {{for a variety of}} dark (i. e., O 3 and NO 3) and UV (i. e., OH) conditions, with OH concentration levels of (0. 5 – 5)  [*]×[*]  10 6  molecules cm − 3, achieving equivalent atmospheric aging of up to 18  h. An aerosol mass spectrometer characterized the direct OA emissions and the SOA formed from the combustion of three wood species (birch, beech and spruce) using two ignition processes (fast ignition with a VOC-to-NO x ratio of 3 and <b>slow</b> <b>ignition</b> with a ratio of 5). Dark and UV aging increased the SOA mass fraction with average SOA productions 2. 0 times the initial OA mass loadings. SOA enhancement was found to be higher for the <b>slow</b> <b>ignition</b> compared with fast ignition conditions. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was used to separate SOA, primary organic aerosol (POA) and their subgroups from the total OA mass spectra. PMF analysis identified two POA and three SOA factors that correlated with the three major oxidizers: ozone, the nitrate radical and the OH radical. Organonitrates (ONs) were observed to be emitted directly from the wood combustion and additionally formed during oxidation via NO 3 radicals (dark aging), suggesting small-scale wood combustion may be a significant ON source. POA was oxidized after the ozone addition, forming aged POA, and after 7  h of aging more than 75  % of the original POA was transformed. This process may involve evaporation and homogeneous gas-phase oxidation as well as heterogeneous oxidation of particulate organic matter. The results generally prove that logwood burning emissions are the subject of intensive chemical processing in the atmosphere, and the timescale for these transformations is relatively short, i. e., hours...|$|E
40|$|A {{chemical}} kinetic {{mechanism for}} the combustion of hydrogen has been assembled and optimized by comparing the observed behavior as determined in shock tube and flame studies with that predicted by the mechanism. The reactions contained in the mechanism reflect {{the current state of}} knowledge of the chemistry of the hydrogen/air system, and the assigned rate coefficients are consistent with accepted values. It was determined that the mechanism is capable of satisfactorily reproducing the experimental results for a range of conditions relevant to scramjet combustion. Calculations made with the reaction mechanism for representative scramjet combustor conditions at Mach 8, 16, and 25 showed that chemical kinetic effects can be important and that combustor models which use nonequilibrium chemistry should be used in preference to models that assume equilibrium chemistry. For the conditions examined the results also showed the importance of including the HO 2 chemistry in the mechanism. For Mach numbers less than 16, the studies suggest that an ignition source will most likely be required to overcome <b>slow</b> <b>ignition</b> chemistry. At Mach 25, the initial temperature and pressure was high enough that ignition was rapid and the presence of an ignition source did not significantly affect reaction rates...|$|E
5000|$|One {{solution}} to this for side-valve engines was to place a screwed plug directly above each valve, and to access the valves through this (illustrated). The tapered threads of the screwed plug provided a reliable seal. For low-powered engines this was a popular solution for some years. It was difficult to cool this plug, as the water jacket didn't extend into the plug. As performance increased, it also became important to have better combustion chamber designs with less [...] "dead space". One solution was to place the spark plug in the centre of this plug, which at least made use of the space. However this also placed the spark plug further away from the main combustion chamber, leading to long flame paths and <b>slower</b> <b>ignition.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Imperial {{processing}} {{facility in}} Cumming, Georgia, {{was shut down}} for 24 hours immediately after the fire when an inspection by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found an inoperative sprinkler system, [...] "improper" [...] fire exits and no evacuation plan. [...] The inspection report stated that the plant posed an [...] "imminent danger" [...] to workers because it lacked an automatic fire extinguisher over the cooker {{similar to the one}} installed in the Hamlet plant, which failed to prevent the disaster, but did <b>slow</b> the <b>ignition</b> of oil in the vat.|$|R
40|$|As {{an attempt}} at {{providing}} insight to develop bet-ter modeling strategies for HCCI engines, the ignition and propagation of a reaction front in a premixed fuel/air stream mixed with hotter exhaust gases is computation-ally investigated using the opposed-flow configuration. The effects of heat and radical transport are studied by imposing various mixing rates on the system. The {{results show that the}} scalar dissipation rate and mixture inhomo-geneities {{have a significant effect on}} auto-ignition of the local mixture. Two different modes of front propagation are identified; the spontaneous propagation mode and the diffusion controlled mode. In the former case, mixing <b>slows</b> down <b>ignition</b> due to loss of radicals from the ig-nition kernel, while in the latter the transport of radi-cals and heat is mainly responsible for propagation of the front. A criterion to distinguish the two ignition modes is suggested based on the characteristic time scales of the auto-ignition and diffusion. The results show that lower mixing rate and higher pressure in general favors igni-tion in the spontaneous propagation mode. A parametric mapping of the ignition delay as a function of the mix-ture fraction and scalar dissipation rate suggests a simpli-fied modeling strategy in multi-dimensional simulation of HCCI engines...|$|R
40|$|Net heat release, knock {{characteristics}} and temperature {{were derived from}} in-cylinder pressure and end-gas CARS measurements for different fuels in a single-cylinder engine. The maximum net heat release rate resulting from {{the final phase of}} autoignition is closely associated with knock intensity. Aromatic fuels have lower maximum heat release rates and lower knock intensities than expected from their octane number when compared to paraffinic fuels; this is observed even when there is significant heating of the end-gas from pre-flame reactions. Leaner mixtures have lower combustion rates so that pressure development is <b>slowed</b> and hence <b>ignition</b> needs to be more advanced to get knock to occur as frequently as in a richer mixture. However, for a given frequency of knock occurrence, there is no significant difference in peak net heat release rates and hence in knock intensities for different mixture strengths...|$|R

5000|$|Technically a {{glow plug}} engine is fairly {{similar to a}} diesel engine and hot bulb engine in that it uses {{internal}} heat to ignite the fuel, but since the ignition timing is not controlled by fuel injection (as in an ordinary diesel engine), or electrically (as in a spark ignition engine), it must be adjusted by changing fuel/air mixture and plug/coil design (usually through adjusting various inlets and controls on the engine itself.) A richer mixture will tend to cool the filament and so retard <b>ignition,</b> <b>slowing</b> the engine. This [...] "configuration" [...] can also be adjusted by using varying plug designs for a more exact thermal control. Of all internal combustion engine types, the glow plug engine resembles most the hot bulb engine, since on both types the ignition occurs due to a [...] "hot spot" [...] within the engine combustion chamber.|$|R
40|$|Effect of {{cetane number}} on {{ignition}} delay and ignition location of disesel spray was experimentally investigated. Five kinds of fuels, which had different cetane numbers of light fraction and heavy fraction of fuel, were used. As a result, the ignition delay {{was not so}} affected by the change of cetane number, however, the ignition location was strongly affected by a cetane number. When the light fraction cetane number was low, the ignition was not observed near the nozzle. And when the heavy fraction cetane number was high, the ignition was observed at the position far from the nozzle. Ignition position {{had an effect on}} flame development. When the ignition occurred near the nozzle, flame development rate was <b>slow.</b> When the <b>ignition</b> occurred at the position far from the nozzle, flame development rate was fast. In case of the ignition position was far from the nozzle, effect of the cetane number on flame development was remarkable...|$|R
40|$|The {{auto-ignition}} {{quality of}} diesel fuels, quantified by their cetane number or derived cetane number (DCN), {{is a critical}} design property to consider when producing and upgrading synthetic paraffinic fuels. It {{is well known that}} auto-ignition characteristics of paraffinic fuels depend on their degree of methyl substitution. However, there remains a need to study the governing chemical functionalities contributing to such ignition characteristics, {{especially in the case of}} methyl substitutions, which have not been studied in detail. In this work, the auto-ignition of 2, 6, 10 -trimethyltridecane has been compared with the reference hydrocarbons used for cetane number determination, i. e. n-hexadecane and heptamethylnonane, all of them being C 16 isomers. Results from a constant-volume combustion chamber under different pressure and temperature initial conditions showed that the ignition delay time for both cool flame and main combustion events increased less from n-hexadecane to trimethyltridecane than from trimethyltridecane to heptamethylnonane. Additional experimental results from blends of these hydrocarbons, together with kinetic modelling, showed that auto-ignition times and combustion rates were correlated to the concentration of the functional groups indicative of methyl substitution, although not in a linear manner. When the concentration of these functional groups decreased, the first stage OH radical concentration increased and ignition delay times decreased, whereas when their concentration increased, H 2 O 2 production was <b>slower</b> and <b>ignition</b> was retarded. Contrary to the ignition delay times, DCN was correlated linearly with functional groups, thus homogenizing the range of values and clarifying the differences between fuels...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPoly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) is {{well known}} as {{biodegradable}} polymer and it is used in many applications since its strength and modulus are comparable with another commercial polymers. However, PLLA exhibits brittle fracture, thus blending of PLLA with other polymer is carried out to improve the toughness of PLLA. In addition, Kenaf fiber is a natural fiber which commonly been used to reinforce the biodegradable composites. However, uses of biodegradable composites is limited in some applications for example appliances, textile, and fabric applications due to low compatibility, low thermal stability at blending temperature and flammability. Therefore, addition of flame retardant filler in PLLA-PLA microsphere/KF composite is to prevent or <b>slow</b> down the <b>ignition</b> of composites which are used in many application such as consumer applications and appliances. A phosphorus-based non-halogenated flame retardant or trade name of NP- 100 is {{used in this study}} to reduce the flammability of the biocomposites. Generally, this flame retardant filler will react with hydrogen and form water, and reduces the rate of combustion. The dielectric breakdown strength of PLLA-PLA microsphere/KF/NP- 100 composites at 0, 2 and 4 wt% of NP- 100 loading was investigated in this study. It was observed that addition of NP- 100 loading at 2 and 4 wt% in composites improved dielectric breakdown strength from 21. 09 kV/mm to 23. 71 kV/mm and 21. 60 kV/mm, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Localized {{ignition}} is {{initiated by}} an external radiant source {{at the middle}} of a thin solid sheet under external slow flow, simulating fire initiation in a spacecraft with a <b>slow</b> ventilation flow. <b>Ignition</b> behavior, subsequent transition simultaneously to upstream and downstream flame spread, and flame growth behavior are studied theoretically and experimentally. There are two transition stages in this study; one is the first transition from the onset of the ignition to form an initial anchored flame close to the sample surface, near the ignited area. The second transition is the flame growth stage from the anchored flame to a steady fire spread state (i. e. no change in flame size or in heat release rate) or a quasi-steady state, if either exists. Observations of experimental spot ignition characteristics and of the second transition over a thermally thin paper were made {{to determine the effects of}} external flow velocity. Both transitions have been studied theoretically to determine the effects of the confinement by a relatively small test chamber, of the ignition configuration (ignition across the sample width vs spot ignition), and of the external flow velocity on the two transitions over a thermally thin paper. This study is currently extending to two new areas; one is to include a thermoplastic sample such poly(methymethacrylate), PMMA, and the other is to determine the effects of sample thickness on the transitions. The recent results of these new studies on the first transition are briefly reported...|$|R
50|$|Glow plugs {{are used}} for {{starting}} as well as continuing the power cycle. The glow plug consists of a durable, mostly platinum, helically wound wire filament, within a cylindrical pocket in the plug body, exposed to the combustion chamber. A small direct current voltage (around 1.5 volts) {{is applied to the}} glow plug, the engine is then started, and the voltage is removed. The burning of the fuel/air mixture in a glow-plug model engine, which requires methanol for the glow plug to work in the first place, and sometimes with the use of nitromethane for greater power output and steadier idle, occurs due to the catalytic reaction of the methanol vapor to the presence of the platinum in the filament, thus causing the ignition. This keeps the plug's filament glowing hot, and allows it to ignite the next charge. Since the ignition timing is not controlled electrically, as in a spark ignition engine or by fuel injection, as in an ordinary diesel, it must be adjusted by the richness of the mixture, the ratio of nitromethane to methanol, the compression ratio, the cooling of the cylinder head, the type of glow plug, etc. A richer mixture will tend to cool the filament and so retard <b>ignition,</b> <b>slowing</b> the engine, and a rich mixture also eases starting. After starting the engine can easily be leaned (by adjusting a needle valve in the spraybar) to obtain maximum power. Glowplug engines are also known as nitro engines. Nitro engines require a 1.5 volt ignitor to light the glow plug in the heat sink. Once primed, pulling the starter with the ignitor in will start the engine.|$|R
40|$|Metallic {{materials}} {{exposed to}} oxygen-enriched atmospheres – as {{commonly used in}} the medical, aerospace, aviation and numerous chemical processing industries – represent a significant fire hazard which must be addressed during design, maintenance and operation. Hence, accurate knowledge of metallic materials flammability is required. Reduced gravity (i. e. space-based) operations present additional unique concerns, where the absence of gravity {{must also be taken}} into account. The flammability of metallic materials has historically been quantified using three standardised test methods developed by NASA, ASTM and ISO. These tests typically involve the forceful (promoted) ignition of a test sample (typically a 3. 2 mm diameter cylindrical rod) in pressurised oxygen. A test sample is defined as flammable when it undergoes burning that is independent of the ignition process utilised. In the standardised tests, this is indicated by the propagation of burning further than a defined amount, or „burn criterion [...] The burn criterion in use at the onset of this project was arbitrarily selected, and did not accurately reflect the length a sample must burn in order to be burning independent of the ignition event and, in some cases, required complete consumption of the test sample for a metallic material to be considered flammable. It has been demonstrated that a) a metallic material. s propensity to support burning is altered by any increase in test sample temperature greater than ~ 250 - 300 oC and b) promoted ignition causes an increase in temperature of the test sample in the region closest to the igniter, a region referred to as the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ). If a test sample continues to burn past the HAZ (where the HAZ is defined as the region of the test sample above the igniter that undergoes an increase in temperature of {{greater than or equal to}} 250 oC by the end of the ignition event), it is burning independent of the igniter, and should be considered flammable. The extent of the HAZ, therefore, can be used to justify the selection of the burn criterion. A two dimensional mathematical model was developed in order to predict the extent of the HAZ created in a standard test sample by a typical igniter. The model was validated against previous theoretical and experimental work performed in collaboration with NASA, and then used to predict the extent of the HAZ for different metallic materials in several configurations. The extent of HAZ predicted varied significantly, ranging from ~ 2 - 27 mm depending on the test sample thermal properties and test conditions (i. e. pressure). The magnitude of the HAZ was found to increase with increasing thermal diffusivity, and decreasing pressure (due to <b>slower</b> <b>ignition</b> times). Based upon the findings of this work, a new burn criterion requiring 30 mm of the test sample to be consumed (from the top of the ignition promoter) was recommended and validated. This new burn criterion was subsequently included in the latest revision of the ASTM G 124 and NASA 6001 B international test standards that are used to evaluate metallic material flammability in oxygen. These revisions also have the added benefit of enabling the conduct of reduced gravity metallic material flammability testing in strict accordance with the ASTM G 124 standard, allowing measurement and comparison of the relative flammability (i. e. Lowest Burn Pressure (LBP), Highest No-Burn Pressure (HNBP) and average Regression Rate of the Melting Interface(RRMI)) of metallic materials in normal and reduced gravity, as well as determination of the applicability of normal gravity test results to reduced gravity use environments. This is important, as currently most space-based applications will typically use normal gravity information in order to qualify systems and/or components for reduced gravity use. This is shown here to be non-conservative for metallic materials which are more flammable in reduced gravity. The flammability of two metallic materials, Inconel® 718 and 316 stainless steel (both commonly used to manufacture components for oxygen service in both terrestrial and space-based systems) was evaluated in normal and reduced gravity using the new ASTM G 124 - 10 test standard. This allowed direct comparison of the flammability of the two metallic materials in normal gravity and reduced gravity respectively. The results of this work clearly show, for the first time, that metallic materials are more flammable in reduced gravity than in normal gravity when testing is conducted as described in the ASTM G 124 - 10 test standard. This was shown to be the case in terms of both higher regression rates (i. e. faster consumption of the test sample – fuel), and burning at lower pressures in reduced gravity. Specifically, it was found that the LBP for 3. 2 mm diameter Inconel® 718 and 316 stainless steel test samples decreased by 50 % from 3. 45 MPa (500 psia) in normal gravity to 1. 72 MPa (250 psia) in reduced gravity for the Inconel® 718, and 25 % from 3. 45 MPa (500 psia) in normal gravity to 2. 76 MPa (400 psia) in reduced gravity for the 316 stainless steel. The average RRMI increased by factors of 2. 2 (27. 2 mm/s in 2. 24 MPa (325 psia) oxygen in reduced gravity compared to 12. 8 mm/s in 4. 48 MPa (650 psia) oxygen in normal gravity) for the Inconel® 718 and 1. 6 (15. 0 mm/s in 2. 76 MPa (400 psia) oxygen in reduced gravity compared to 9. 5 mm/s in 5. 17 MPa (750 psia) oxygen in normal gravity) for the 316 stainless steel. Reasons for the increased flammability of metallic materials in reduced gravity compared to normal gravity are discussed, based upon the observations made during reduced gravity testing and previous work. Finally, the implications (for fire safety and engineering applications) of these results are presented and discussed, in particular, examining methods for mitigating the risk of a fire in reduced gravity...|$|R
