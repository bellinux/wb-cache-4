Also because Yu Tang's life has always been smooth-sailing, {{he wants to make}} her stronger through different obstacles he gives her as he secretly likes her. When <b>sales</b> <b>team</b> 3 loses a longtime key account that keeps their department afloat, Wen Kai gives them a new account to handle and transfer Chen You Rui (JR) from another <b>sales</b> <b>team</b> to team 3. Yu Tang's work life just went from bad to worst because You Rui is a constant flirt who is known to flirt with anyone that is female and he has a history of flirting with Yu Tang.|$|R

2500|$|The company's history {{goes back}} to the 1980s when the first {{versions}} of Intel server-based voice messaging and call processing systems were released. The CallXpress product originated from Applied Voice Technology (AVT, NASDAQ:AVTC) which later became Captaris, Inc. [...] In 2003, Sound Advantage purchased the CallXpress Voicemail and Unified Messaging solution from Captaris and this merger of technologies became a new entity called Applied Voice & Speech Technologies, Inc. (AVST). The acquisition included the retention of key products and technology as well as the entire product engineering, support and <b>sales</b> <b>teams.</b> AVST was established in September 2003 by the merger of Sound Advantage (established in 1997) and the AVT division (established in 1982) of Captaris, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAPA).|$|E
2500|$|Transpo was {{the idea}} of L. Mendel Rivers, {{chairman}} of the House Armed Services Committee. Rivers had visited the Paris Air Show on occasion; at the time, there were a [...] "ring" [...] of three major air shows in Europe that took turns hosting, Farnborough, Paris and Hanover. Visitors from around the world could come to the show where <b>sales</b> <b>teams</b> from the aviation firms were ready to sign deals for their latest products. Rivers lamented {{the fact that there was}} no similar industry-based show in the U.S. Rivers started planning a U.S. version of the air/trade show, and selected Washington as a natural location due to the density of military contacts and the presence of the recently expanded Dulles Airport. Rivers went to Congress with a request for $750,000 in funding.|$|E

40|$|Sales {{leaders who}} can foster <b>sales</b> <b>team</b> {{engagement}} drive an organization 2 ̆ 7 s sales performance. Some information technology <b>sales</b> leaders lack <b>team</b> engagement strategies that support revenue results above market growth rates. The {{purpose of this}} qualitative, single-case {{study was to explore}} the team engagement strategies of 6 sales leaders, in various offices in the Asia-Pacific region of a single, public information technology company, who demonstrated the ability to support year-on-year revenue results above market growth rates. Participants demonstrated the ability to foster team engagement and consistently deliver year-on-year revenue results above market growth rates. The conceptual framework for this study was self-determination theory, a macro theory of motivation. Data collection included semistructured interviews with the sales leaders and a review of company documents, including sales plans, sales results by country, and training and recognition programs. Data analysis included keyword coding, category development, and theme identification. Three themes emerged: using extrinsic motivators, activating intrinsic motivators, and catalyzing team engagement. Extrinsic motivators included both tangible and intangible rewards. Intrinsic motivators included encouraging <b>sales</b> <b>team</b> autonomy, developing <b>sales</b> <b>team</b> competence, and fostering <b>sales</b> <b>team</b> relatedness. Implications for positive social change include providing organizations with engagement strategies that sales leaders could use to offer better employee work-life experiences. When sales leaders improve <b>sales</b> <b>team</b> engagement, team members experience psychological benefits, which may enhance the quality of their personal lives as well as {{the quality of life for}} members of their families and communities...|$|R
