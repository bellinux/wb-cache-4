5000|$|Some {{stations}} are {{in remote areas}} that {{are not easy to}} access, limiting their population greatly. Accommodation for couples and families may be limited. [...] Consequently, many station employees are young and temporary. An important example is the jackaroo (male) or jillaroo (female), a young person who works on a station for several years in a form of apprenticeship, in order to become an overseer or rural property manager. Aborigines have played a big part in the northern cattle industry where they were competent stockmen on the cattle stations. Nowadays staff on these stations may work in the homestead and in <b>stock</b> <b>camps.</b> Stockmen, especially ringers, may be seasonal employees. Others include boremen, managers, mechanics, machinery operators (including grader drivers), station and camp cooks, teachers, overseers and bookkeepers. Veterinary surgeons also fly to some of the more distant cattle and sheep stations.|$|R
50|$|Aboriginal stockmen {{played a}} large part {{in the life of}} Top End cattle stations. These men and women were splendid stockmen and were an {{integral}} part of the musters. Mustering in the Top End is conducted during the dry season from April to September when additional stockmen will be employed for the purpose. Initially, mustering here involved having <b>stock</b> <b>camps</b> where about three to seven ringers under a head stockman or overseer rode out with the horses to the area to be mustered. The musterers started early each day by bringing up the hobbled horses, saddling up and then spending a long day mustering, branding, castrating and drafting the cattle. These long days were hard on man and beast with each having to contend with the heat, dust and flies. The men endured camping on the ground and had a monotonous diet of meals that were cooked on an open fire, usually by an unskilled cook.|$|R
30|$|Secondly, wealthy {{families}} seem to {{be better}} at negotiating rights of access to high quality grazing patches outside of their home range, {{making it easier for}} them to reach these distant patches before they are used up. We suggest that dual access to private transportation and reliable, timely information via cell phone (both a result of greater access to cash) is the major difference between these two classes. Two of the wealthy families in our study owned private motorcycles and reported driving out to new grazing patches before sending affines or hired herders there to graze. Having their own transportation gives them an advantage over herders dependent on local information; timely access to better information about patch quality allows them to make more informed decisions about where to migrate or when. Access to transportation means they can also regularly visit their satellite <b>stock</b> <b>camps</b> and monitor the progress of the herd so as to make well-timed decisions about when to migrate, sell off improved stock, and breed existing stock, among others.|$|R

5000|$|After {{collapsing}} {{during a}} failed summit attempt on Mount Everest in 1995, Mauduit was carried {{off the mountain}} by other climbers.

Viesturs writes that initially he was uncertain about the real cause of death, suggesting possible other causes, but then recognises that it was possible that a rockfall or ice had broken the neck of the two climbers. Viesturs was on Dhaulagiri at the time of Mauduit's death, but had no first hand knowledge about how Mauduit died. Chantal Mauduit's body was returned to France and the autopsy concluded that {{the cause of death was}} a broken neck.

40|$|Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic {{heavy metal}} with no known {{biological}} function. Exposure {{of the human}} population to Cd is predominantly through cigarette smoke and Cd-containing foodstuffs. Many phosphatic fertilizers contain Cd and their application to land used for food production results in increased concentrations of Cd in the soil. The fate of this Cd in soils is poorly understood. In this study, factors influencing the concentration and residence time of Cd in pastoral soils were investigated. Total Cd concentrations in topsoil samples (0 - 7. 5 cm) from a regularly fertilized farm were found to range between 0. 07 and 0. 91 mg Cd kg- 1 (arithmetic mean of 0. 36 mg Cd kg- 1). The top soil Cd concentration was unrelated to soil type or parent material but correlated well with total phosphorus and total carbon. In {{a study of the}} distribution of total Cd throughout the profiles of 17 soil types on the farm, Cd concentrations generally decreased with depth and soil parent material contributed little to topsoil Cd loads. A comparison of pedologically matched fertilized and unfertilized soils on the same farm confirmed that phosphatic fertilizer was the dominant source of Cd. Fertilized sites showed a 3 - to 20 -fold increase in soil Cd loading. Increased Cd concentrations were detectable to 15 cm. These increased Cd loads were easily accounted for by an estimated phosphatic fertilizer input of 6 g Cd ha- 1 yr- 1 over 7 decades. Soil Cd concentrations were also influenced by <b>stock</b> <b>camping</b> behaviour, although the magnitude of this effect was much less than that due to fertilizer. To investigate conditions under which Cd may move deeper in the soil profile, laboratory-based leaching studies on repacked soil columns using various electrolyte leaching solutions were conducted. Columns leached with 2. 5 mM CaCl 2, CaSO 4 and Ca(NO 3) 2 showed some limited movement of Cd, but columns leached with 2. 5 to 7. 5 mM KCl showed no significant redistribution of the added Cd. Under the soil conditions studied (pHH 2 O 5. 45), cation exchange appeared the predominant driving force behind Cd mobility, not anion complexation. On the same soil, Cd mobility increased linearly as leachate CaCl 2 concentration increased. By 50 mM CaCl 2 most Cd was leached from the column. In view of the dominance of Cl in coastal soil solutions, this mobility under the influence of CaCl 2 may be important. In a further experiment, four soils differing in physical and chemical properties were leached with 2. 5 mM CaCl 2. The wide range of Cd mobility seen, could be explained by differences in soil pH (pHH 2 O 4. 95 - 6. 02). The movement observed in these columns was adequately modelled using a simple convection-dispersion equation and adsorption isotherms. The movement of Cd observed and modelled in these laboratory studies suggests that leaching {{is likely to be a}} much more important mechanism of Cd loss from the soil profile than removal of animal products. This work was supported by findings from a field-based mass balance study of Cd inputs and accumulation in soil developed under pasture on a Wharekohe podzol. Despite clear accumulation of fertilizer-derived Cd in the surface of these pastoral soils, up to 44 % of the applied Cd remained unaccounted for. The most likely reason for this was leaching. Accurate modelling of the residence time and plant availability of Cd in soils will rely on a quantitative understanding of the factors influencing Cd mobility in soils. This is an area requiring further research...|$|R

Gribble monitored the situation and when told that Aborigines were beginning to move south towards Nulla Nulla he sent Ernest Unbah to contact {{as many as possible}} and to urge them to turn back. Before he could make contact Unbah was arrested by police constable St Jack for entering the prohibited area. On 18 May, Overheu made a formal complaint that a large mob of Aborigines were spearing cattle on the station and along with Tommy Doort, his wife Lyddie and two <b>stock</b> boys <b>camped</b> on the lower Pentecost River to await the arrival of police. Constable St Jack, trackers Jacob and Windie Joe and with Unbah still in chains arrived on 20 May and the group moved to Durragee Hill where they camped for the night, close to where a mob of 250-300 Aborigines were holding a ceremony on an island in the river. At dawn on 24 May, St Jack, against regulations, armed Windie, Jacob and Tommy with shotguns and the patrol rushed the camp to disperse the Aborigines. Gribble entered a note into the mission log dated 27 May, reporting hearing [...] "news" [...] that Tommy and Windie Joe had killed Blui-Nua. An old man named Umbillie was reported killed by blows to the head by unknown persons. An Aboriginal eyewitness, Aldoa, claimed that St Jack and Overheu were present when Umbillie was killed and historian Dr Neville Green argues that the injuries reported on Umbillie suggest that he had been run down by a horse and killed by being beaten over the head with a stirrup iron or a rifle butt. At this point it was not known that any Aborigines had been shot, only that several had been beaten to death and their bodies recovered for burial. At the Royal Commission St Jack testified that he had shot 31 dogs and admitted hearing Tommy and Windie Joe firing their shotguns but denied seeing any Aborigines wounded or killed. Overheu testified that he did not hear any shots fired at all and that none could have been fired without his knowledge. St Jack was unable to account for how many shots were or were not fired as required by regulations as he claimed Windie Joe had lost the ammunition bag while fording the Pentecost River. [...] Witnesses described people being wounded by both bullets and shotgun pellets implicating Overheu and St Jack as they were the only ones with rifles and pistols.|$|R

The cavalry, Brigadier - General Kilpatrick commanding, will receive special orders from the commander-in-chief.III. There will be no general train of supplies, but each corps will have its ammunition-train and provision-train, distributed habitually as follows: Behind each regiment should follow one wagon and one ambulance; behind each brigade should follow a due proportion of ammunition - wagons, provision-wagons, and ambulances. In case of danger, each corps commander should change this order of march, by having his advance and rear brigades unencumbered by wheels. The separate columns will start habitually at 7 a.m., and make about fifteen miles per day, unless otherwise fixed in orders.IV. The army will forage liberally on the country during the march. To this end, each brigade commander will organize a good and sufficient foraging party, under the command of one or more discreet officers, who will gather, near the route traveled, corn or forage of any kind, meat of any kind, vegetables, corn-meal, or whatever is needed by the command, aiming at all times to keep in the wagons at least ten day's provisions for the command and three days' forage.

William T. Sherman The march was made easier by able assistants such as Orlando Metcalfe Poe, chief of the bridge building and demolition team. Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman selected Poe as his chief engineer in 1864. Poe oversaw the burning of Atlanta, for which action he was honored by Sherman. Poe directly supervised the dismantling of all buildings and structures in Atlanta that could have provided any military value to the Rebels once Sherman abandoned the city; rail depots, roundhouses, arsenals and storage areas were manually disassembled and the combustible materials then destroyed by controlled fires (however, Poe was incensed at the level of uncontrolled arson by marauding soldiers not of his unit which resulted in heavy damage to civilian homes.) He served in this capacity past the fall of Atlanta {{to the end of the}} war. Dozens of river crossings, poor or non-existent roads and the extensive swamps of southern Georgia would have fatally slowed Sherman's force had not Poe's skills as leader of the bridge, road and pontoon building units kept the army moving. He also continued to supervise destruction of Confederate infrastructure. Promoted by Sherman by two steps in rank to colonel after the fall of Savannah, he continued in that capacity in the war's concluding Carolinas Campaign as Sherman headed northwards from Savannah to link up with Grant and the Army of the Potomac in Virginia and to cut another swath through South and North Carolina.|$|R
