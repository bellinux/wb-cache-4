40|$|When {{embarking on}} an {{experimental}} program {{for purposes of}} discovery and understanding, it is only prudent to use appropriate analysis tools {{to aid in the}} discovery process. Due to the limited scope of experimental measurement analytical results can significantly complement the data after a reasonable validation process has occurred. In this manner the analytical results can help to explain certain measurements, suggest other measurements to take and point to possible modifications to the experimental apparatus. For these reasons it was decided to create a detailed nonlinear finite element model of the Sandia Microslip Experiment. This experiment was designed to investigate energy dissipation due to microslip in bolted joints and to identify the critical parameters involved. In an attempt to limit the microslip to a single interface a complicated system of rollers and cables was devised to clamp the two <b>slipping</b> <b>members</b> together with a prescribed normal load without using a bolt. An oscillatory tangential load is supplied via a shaker. The finite element model includes the clamping device in addition to the sequence of steps taken in setting up the experiment. The interface is modeled using Coulomb friction requiring a modest validation procedure for estimating the coefficient of friction. Analysis results have indicated misalignment problems in the experimental procedure, identified transducer locations for more accurate measurements, predicted complex interface motions including the potential for galling, identified regions where microslip occurs and during which parts of the loading cycle it occurs, all this in addition to the energy dissipated per cycle. A number of these predictions have been experimentally corroborated in varying degrees and are presented in the paper along with the details of the finite element model...|$|R

40|$|A {{sensitivity}} {{study was}} performed with a nonlinear elastic {{finite element model}} for monotonic analyses of wood-framed shear walls. The objective was {{to provide information about}} simplifying a model of wood-framed shear walls with no significant loss in accuracy. The simplifications concern features such as slips in joints between frame <b>members,</b> <b>slips</b> in hold-down connections, and bearing between adjacent sheathing panels. The results from analyses of a shear wall with an opening of window shape show that the effect of constraint by the bearing between sheathing panels and slips in frame joints on the overall stiffness of the wall is limited. Thus, there are great possibilities for reducing the calculation time by not taking these phenomena into account, avoiding an excessive number of degrees of freedom and iterations. The influence of the simplifications on the distribution of vertical reaction forces along the wall is more significant. Furthermore, if each simplification is introduced separately, the effect on the overall stiffness is greater. The difference, however, is less than 10 %. The failing pattern of the nail connections is also clearly influenced by the simplifications when they are introduced separately. The results from the analyses show that slips in frame joints can be sufficiently represented by those in connection with the opening...|$|R
40|$|Interest in timber-concrete {{composite}} (TCC) floors {{has increased}} over the last 20 - 30 years. Since the 1990 a??s, TCC solution {{is seen as a}} viable and effective alternative to conventional reinforced concrete and/or traditional timber floors in multistorey buildings. In TCC technology, a timber beam, either solid wood, glued laminated or laminated veneer lumber (LVL), is connected to a concrete slab using a connection system that resists shear forces and impedes <b>slip</b> between the <b>members</b> of the composite section. The strength, stiffness, location and number of connectors play a crucial role for the composite action and determine the structural and serviceability performance of the floor system. This paper discusses {{the state of the art}} of TCC structures. It presents a comprehensive review of the literature about the development and structural behaviour of TCC structures. The review addresses construction aspects and shear connection concepts. It evaluates experimental tests, finite element and numerical models. It discusses the influence of concrete elements. As recommendations, the best types of shear connection for cast in-situ and prefabricated TCC floors are put forward and assessed for criteria such as strength, stiffness, ductility and ease of manufacturing. Furthermore the most relevant numerical models are introduced. These models can be used to further the experimental results in parameters such as connections, configurations, geometrical and material properties...|$|R

40|$|Stress {{laminated}} timber bridge decks consist of planks or glulam timber members that are put together {{side by side}} to form plates or solid volumes of wood {{to be used as}} bridge decks. The decks may also be used for other purposes than bridge decks. Load-carrying capacities of these decks are very high and friction alone carries load between individual members. Friction is achieved by using prestressed steel rods through the decks that give normal compressive forces between members, see Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Left: bridge deck in laboratory test situation. Right: FE modelThe load vs. displacement curve for a transversally loaded deck is normally nonlinear even for low load values but especially for high loads due to partial <b>slip</b> between <b>members.</b> FE simulations and laboratory tests for behaviour have been made earlier, see [1], [2], [3]. Two different approaches for FE-simulations have been used, one with an elastic-plastic material model without discrete member modeling and another with discrete member modeling and contact surfaces between members. In the presentation a summary of earlier results are shown and also some recent results due to additional features in the FE models. The additions are possibilities too simulate gaps between members for the elastic-plastic model and results from butt-end modeling with the contact model. Fig. 2 shows an example of a non-linear load vs. displacement curve for a model with butt-end joints in the deck. Fig. 2. load vs. displacement curve for a model with butt-end joints in the deck.

40|$|Longitudinal bar slip {{resulting}} from strain penetration {{at the end}} of flexural concrete members will result in a member end rotation and additional lateral deformations in members such as walls, columns and beams. The contribution of these member end rotations can account for as much as 35 percent of the total lateral deformations of these members. Therefore, the deformation {{resulting from}} strain penetration should be accurately accounted for when modeling reinforced concrete members subjected to flexural actions. In order to model the bar slip as well as the associated member end rotation due to strain penetration of longitudinal bars adequately anchored into joints or footings, a local bond stress-slip constitutive relationship is typically required to be incorporated in detailed simulation models to model the interface between the reinforcement and concrete. However, the local bond-slip models available for analytical detailed simulation were developed from experimental tests conducted on reinforcing bars with short embedment length, where the slip of test bar occurred when they were subjected to strains well below the yield strain. Consequently, these models are strictly not applicable to critical flexural regions such as the plastic hinges experiencing significant nonlinear strains. In order for the reinforced concrete structures to develop ductile response during moderate or severe earthquake excitations, these structures are designed to develop plastic hinges in the critical moment regions at the wall and column bases {{as well as at the}} beam end regions. In these situations, the longitudinal reinforcement at the connection interface experiences as high as 25 times the yield strain, causing the rebar to slip over the entire (e. g., beam ends) or partial length (e. g., column and wall bases) through deterioration of local bond at the steel-concrete interface. Given that the objective of detailed analysis should be to produce satisfactory global and local responses, it should be realized that accurately representing the local bond-slip behavior of longitudinal reinforcing bar experiencing inelastic strains is critical. This measure will enable the bar <b>slip</b> and <b>member</b> end rotations due to strain penetration to be quantified accurately. An alternative approach that maybe suitable for fiber-based analysis is to model the bar stress vs. slip hysteretic response directly as proposed by Zhao and Sritharan (2007), thereby capturing the local and global responses accurately. Their model was based on limited test data derived from pull out tests conducted on reinforcing bars with long embedment length, forcing the bars experienced large inelastic strains. In consideration of the state-of-the-art summary presented above on the bond-slip behavior of reinforcing steel subjected to inelastic strains, an experimental investigation was designed and completed recently. In these tests, test bars were designed with sufficient anchorage lengths as would be the case for bars anchored into foundations. A total of five bars of two different bar sizes (i. e., # 6 and # 8) were tested under both monotonic and cyclic loadings. Following collection of quality data from these tests, the model proposed by Zhao and Sritharan was examined and found to be appropriate for modeling the bar stress vs. loaded-end slip relationship at the interface between column or wall and the foundation. Through an analytical investigation combined with measured data along the embedded portion of the bar length, it was further found that the bond strength reduces as the reinforcing bar experienced inelastic strains. Using the suggestion of Wang (2008) that this reduction could be accounted for through a modification factor, an investigation was conducted by comparing the predicted bar stress vs. loaded-end slip relationship derived from this analytical investigation to the pullout test results. It was found that the modification factor proposed by Wang (2008) was useful in improving the global response. In this analysis process, the strain and local slip distributions along the bar embedment length were examined for when the bar was subjected to strains well above the yield strain. Significant local slip was found to occur along the embedment length over the portion of the rebar experiencing significant inelastic strains, which was consistent with the measured data. Based on the completed study it is concluded that: 1) local bond-slip relation will be different for a reinforcing bar subjected inelastic strains than those found from bars subjected to elastic strains; 2) the existing local bond models may be modified with a factor such as that proposed by Wang (2008) to account for the effects of inelastic strains; and 3) strain penetration model widely of Zhao and Sritharan that is widely used in fiber-based analysis sufficient will sufficient captures the effects of strain penetration effects...|$|R
