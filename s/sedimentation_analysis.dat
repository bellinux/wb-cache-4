Co-elution from a DEAE-Sephadex column and co-sedimentation in glycerol density gradients of deoxyribonuclease and polymerase D activity suggest a molecular association. Polymerases A, B and C are devoid of nuclease activity.

40|$|AbstractPulmonary {{surfactant}} protein SP-B is synthesized as {{a larger}} precursor, proSP-B. We report that a recombinant form of human SP-BN forms a coiled coil structure at acidic pH. The protonation of a residue with pK= 4. 8 ± 0. 06 is the responsible of conformational changes detected by circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence emission. <b>Sedimentation</b> velocity <b>analysis</b> showed protein oligomerisation at any pH condition, with an enrichment {{of the species}} compatible with a tetramer at acidic pH. Low 2, 2, 2,-trifluoroethanol concentration promoted β-sheet structures in SP-BN, which bind Thioflavin T, at acidic pH, whereas it promoted coiled coil structures at neutral pH. The amino acid stretch predicted to form β-sheet parallel association in SP-BN overlaps with the sequence predicted by several programs to form coiled coil structure. A synthetic peptide (60 W-E 85) designed from the sequence of the amino acid stretch of SP-BN predicted to form coiled coil structure showed random coil conformation at neutral pH but concentration-dependent helical structure at acidic pH. <b>Sedimentation</b> velocity <b>analysis</b> of the peptide indicated monomeric state at neutral pH (s 20, w= 0. 55 S; Mr~ 3 kDa) and peptide association (s 20, w= 1. 735 S; Mr=~ 14 kDa) at acidic pH, with sedimentation equilibrium fitting to a Monomer-Nmer-Mmer model with N= 6 and M= 4 (Mr= 14692 Da).
