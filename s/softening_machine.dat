30|$|These {{layers of}} fibres were {{processed}} through <b>softener</b> <b>machine</b> for <b>softening</b> of banana fibres and then carding of banana fibres {{was carried out}} on breaker jute carding machine. After carding the 100 % banana fibers web was fed to needle punching machine and 100 % parallel laid (P.L.) banana non-woven fabric was prepared. The cross laid (C.L.) non-woven fabric was prepared by mixing 60 : 40 % of banana fibres with polypropylene fibres and these carded web was fed to needle punching machine for preparation of 60 : 40 % cross laid banana: polypropylene non-woven fabric.|$|R

The coupled damage-plasticity model consists of a physically based dislocation density model and a damage model driven by plastic straining {{in combination with the}} stress state. The predicted chip serration is highly consistent with the measurement results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMachining {{advanced}} materials, e. g. titanium alloys, usually {{results in}} a short tool life. Laser-assisted milling represents an innovative method to enhance machinability with less tool wear and an increased material removal rate. The material is heated locally and thereby <b>softened</b> before <b>machining.</b> This paper describes a thermo-mechanical simulation of a laser-assisted milling process {{in order to achieve}} a controlled heat impact. For that purpose the influence of different material parameters on the temperature field was analyzed computationally. The penetration depth of the laser induced heat and the thermally induced internal loads were investigated considering the loss of material and thus of heat during the milling process. Finally, the laser and the milling parameters were adapted for a real laser-assisted process...|$|R
40|$|Experiments are run to {{show that}} {{different}} machining conditions applied to ultra-fine grained pure titanium lead to different levels of grain coarsening and <b>softening</b> near the <b>machined</b> surface. Under “hard” machining conditions the upper 40 microns of the machined surface are altered with a decreased microhardness. The experimental results are reasonably reproduced by model calculations. Expanding the parameter field of the model calculations, the surface coarsening diagram and the surface softening diagram due to machining are presented, showing the region of technological parameters, under which neither grain coarsening nor softening takes place along the machined surface...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{sawtooth}} chip from {{hard cutting}} can {{influence on the}} precision of the form and dimension, the machined surface integrity and the tool life. A study on the microcosmic dynamic fracture mechanism of hardened bearing steel {{carried out by the}} author, based on the microcosmic observing and analysing of sections of the chips from PCBN tools cutting GCr 15 bearing steel. The experiments and analyses indicate that the adiabatic shear loses stabilization in the primary deformation zones due to thermal <b>softening</b> during cutting <b>machining,</b> and shear ductile fracture limitation of the chip forms. The sawtooth chip formation of GCr 15 bearing steel hardened cutting results not from the periodical brittleness fracture but from periodical adiabatic shear fracture; being no clear damnification before the adiabatic shear loses stabilization, thermal softening occurs and be controlled by nucleation, growth and coalescence of microvoids in the whole shear fracture tenacity progress...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} on surface integrity (surface roughness, microstructure and microhardness) {{were carried out}} in order to analyze the cutting parameters affected the surface integrity for better machinability of AlSi/AlN MMC. Five cutting parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, volume fraction of particles reinforcement and type of coated insert) were performed. Two types of coating (TiB 2 and TiN/TiCN/TiN) of carbide cutting tools were employed to machine various volume fractions of AlN particles (5 %, 7 % and 10 %) reinforced to AlSi Alloy MMC under dry cutting condition. The results shows that the optimum levels for minimum surface roughness are; A 1 (single coating of insert), B 3 (cutting speed: 250 m/min), C 2 (feed rate: 0. 75 mm/tooth), D 1 (axial depth: 0. 6 mm) and E 1 (5 % reinforcement). Surface roughness value increases along with increase in volume fraction of reinforcement. Depth of cut is more significant than feed rate and cutting speed in obtaining lower surface roughness. This {{could be due to}} the formation of BUE on the rake face of cutting tool at higher Depth Of Cut (DOC). The increases of volume fraction of AlN particles, from 5 to 10 % give contribution to the changes of hardness. A surface dislocation is occurred at the highest speed and feed; 250 m/min and 0. 9 mm/tooth. This phenomenon happens at high cutting condition due to the highly heat generation which <b>softens</b> the <b>machined</b> surface...|$|R
40|$|A new {{material}} constitutive law is implemented in a 2 D {{finite element model}} to analyse the chip formation and shear localisation when machining titanium alloys. The numerical simulations use a commercial finite element software (FORGE 2005) able to solve complex thermo-mechanical problems. One of the main machining characteristics of titanium alloys is to produce segmented chips {{for a wide range}} of cutting speeds and feeds. The present study assumes that the chip segmentation is only induced by adiabatic shear banding, without material failure in the primary shear zone. The new developed model takes into account the influence of strain, strain rate and temperature on the flow stress and also introduces a strain softening effect. The tool chip friction is managed by a combined Coulomb–Tresca friction law. The influence of two different strain <b>softening</b> levels and <b>machining</b> parameters on the cutting forces and chip morphology has been studied. Chip morphology, cutting and feed forces predicted by numerical simulations are compared with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the demand}} for a {{responsible}} use {{of natural resources and}} energy the need for lightweight materials is increasing. The most common materials for lightweight production are high and highest strength steel. These materials are difficult to machine using conventional sheet metal working processes because the high strength leads to a limited formability and high tool wear. The Fraunhofer IPT developed the laser-assisted sheet metal working. Selective laser based heating of the part directly before <b>machining</b> <b>softens</b> the material locally. Thus the quality of the following cut can be increased, for example for shearing 1. 4310 the clear cut surface ratio can be increased from 20 % up to 100 % using a shearing gap of 10 % of the sheet thickness. Because of the softening of the material and thus the increased formability, parts with a higher complexity can be produced. For example 1. 4310 can be bent laser-assisted with a radius of 0. 25 mm instead of 2 - 3 mm using the convent ional process. For the first time spring steel can be embossed with conventional tools up to 50 % of the sheet thickness. For the implementation in series production a modular system upgrade "hy-PRESS" has been developed to include laser and scanner technology into existing presses. For decoupling the sensitive optical elements of the machine vibrations an active-passive damping system has been developed. The combination of this new hybrid process and the system technology allows to produce parts of high strength steel with a high complexity and quality...|$|R
