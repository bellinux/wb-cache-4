25|$|In early 1946, new {{elections}} {{were held in}} India. With {{the announcement of the}} elections the line had been drawn for Muslim voters to choose between a united Indian state or Partition. Earlier, {{at the end of the}} war in 1945, the colonial government had announced the public trial of three senior officers of Subhas Chandra Bose's defeated Indian National Army who stood accused of treason. Now as the trials began, the Congress leadership, although it never supported the INA, chose to defend the accused officers. The subsequent convictions of the officers, the public outcry against the convictions, and the eventual remission of the sentences created positive propaganda for the Congress, which enabled it to win the party's subsequent electoral victories in eight of the eleven provinces. The negotiations between the Congress and the Muslim League, however, <b>stumbled</b> <b>over</b> the issue of the partition.|$|E
25|$|The Senators faced John McGraw's heavily favored New York Giants in the 1924 World Series. The {{two teams}} traded wins {{back and forth}} until the series reached the seventh and {{deciding}} game. The Senators trailed the Giants 3 to 1 {{in the eighth inning}} of Game 7, when Bucky Harris hit a routine ground ball to third which hit a pebble and took a bad hop over Giants third baseman Freddie Lindstrom. Two runners scored on the play, tying the score at three. An aging Walter Johnson then came in to pitch the ninth inning, and held the Giants scoreless into extra innings. In the bottom of the twelfth inning with Ruel at bat, he hit a high, foul ball directly over home plate. The Giants' catcher, Hank Gowdy, dropped his protective mask to field the ball but, failing to toss the mask aside, <b>stumbled</b> <b>over</b> it and dropped the ball, thus giving Ruel another chance to bat. On the next pitch, Ruel hit a double and proceeded to score the winning run when Earl McNeely hit a ground ball that took another bad hop over Lindstrom's head. This would mark the only World Series triumph for the franchise during their 60-year tenure in Washington.|$|E

25|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, and when food is locally abundant, the ducks may congregate in small flocks, sometimes {{of up to}} about a hundred. Murphy noted:On December 20th, 1912, I photographed a pair of teals feeding in a trickle of water which ran through tall tussock grass from the melting edge of a glacier. The birds were well hidden by the screen of grass, and I almost <b>stumbled</b> <b>over</b> them before seeing them. They appeared quite unconcerned, however, and continued prodding about in the mud. When I had come within two steps of them, they raised their heads and waddled farther off among the hummocks, from where they peered out through drooping grass. All but the bright eyes and yellow bills blended completely with the surroundings. Matthews has well said that their pattern fits in so thoroughly with the environment that it is sometimes only {{the movement of the}} conspicuous yellow bill that calls one’s attention to their presence. Many observers have noted the birds’ preference to lose themselves in the grass when they are approached, rather than to seek safety in the air, and it is likely that before the arrival of men and guns at South Georgia they used their wings only for relatively short and infrequent flights.|$|E
500|$|Booth {{made his}} stage debut at age 17 on August 14, 1855, in the {{supporting}} {{role of the}} Earl of Richmond in Richard III at Baltimore's Charles Street Theatre. The audience jeered at the inexperienced actor when he missed some of his lines. He also began acting at Baltimore's Holliday Street Theater, owned by John T. Ford, where the Booths had performed frequently. In 1857, Booth joined the stock company of the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he played for a full season. At his request, he was billed as [...] "J.B. Wilkes", a pseudonym meant to avoid comparison {{with other members of}} his famous thespian family. Jim Bishop wrote that Booth [...] "developed into an outrageous scene stealer, but he played his parts with such heightened enthusiasm that the audiences idolized him." [...] In February 1858, he played in Lucrezia Borgia at the Arch Street Theatre. On opening night, he experienced stage fright and <b>stumbled</b> <b>over</b> his line. Instead of introducing himself by saying, [...] "Madame, I am Petruchio Pandolfo", he stammered, [...] "Madame, I am Pondolfio Pet—Pedolfio Pat—Pantuchio Ped—dammit!

500|$|At {{the age of}} 23, Benjamin Kiplagat was {{competing}} in his second Olympic Games. Like Araptany he qualified for the men's 3000 metres steeplechase because his best time of eight minutes and 3.81 seconds, recorded at the 2010 Athletissima, met the [...] "A" [...] qualifying standard. Kiplagat said {{that he wanted to}} finish in a podium position in the event and revealed that he was not worried about wet-weather conditions affecting his performance. He took part in the event's first heat on 3 August, finishing sixth out of 13 runners, with a time of eight minutes and 18.44 seconds. Kiglagat held the lead in the heat's early stage although he <b>stumbled</b> <b>over</b> the steeple in the penultimate lap but was able to regain his balance and finished at a reduced pace. Nevertheless, his time allowed him to qualify for the event's final. In the final, held two days later, Kiplagat fell and injured his knee after he was reportedly pushed by another athlete, and moved to the inside line while changing his tactics to remain away from the lead pack. He was initially recorded as finishing 14th out of 15 runners with a time of eight minutes and 47.85 seconds, but was disqualified for his inside line change.|$|E

500|$|On {{the day of}} broadcast, The Mirror {{reported}} that EastEnders producers may have to re-write the episode or run a pre-recorded rehearsal tape rather than {{go ahead with the}} live transmission, as Turner was suffering from the flu and was unable to speak. In the event, Turner recovered enough to appear, though was given permission to whisper her lines if necessary. She was able to deliver her dialogue as planned, however was too ill to appear on EastEnders Live: The Aftermath following the episode. Turner commented that nothing could have stopped her from appearing in the episode, as the cast had worked so hard on it, and it was [...] "such a big part of TV history". Several errors were made during the transmission. Barbara Windsor as Peggy incorrectly called Janine [...] "June" [...] and Maslen <b>stumbled</b> <b>over</b> several of his lines. During the final scene, a camera was visibly jostled, sound became muffled and some zoom shots [...] "misfired".

On 29 March 1944, two or three black sedan cars arrived, Catanach was taken in the first car with three Gestapo agents including SS-Sturmbannfuhrer Johannes Post a senior officer based there. Post had his driver stop the car in the countryside outside Kiel about 1630 hours and called Catanach out into a field where he promptly shot him. The second (and possibly a third) car drew up in the same place shortly afterwards and Post told his agents to get Christensen, Espelid and Fuglesang out, stating that they should take a [...] break before their long drive.

2500|$|Although no runs {{were scored}} in the first seven innings, Hilldale mounted several threats. In the second inning, they left runners at second and third after a walk by Thomas and a double by Stephens. In the third, Briggs led off with an infield single and was sacrificed to second, but was then picked off by Bell. In the fourth, Mackey led off with a single, and Judy Johnson {{followed}} with a double. Thomas then grounded to short, and Moore threw out Mackey at the plate.

2500|$|July 30, {{just after}} 3:00 AM the men <b>stumbled</b> <b>over</b> an old wagon trail. After {{stumbling}} a {{way along the}} easier trail, Cooper stopped.

The men rejoiced with harsh shouts and they fired their weapons like it was the Fourth of July. [...] Between 5:00 and 6:00 AM the half dead soldiers staggered into Double Lakes to the water holes they had dug a week before. The men sent out for water came in last, they had gone over the trail without notice, and turned around when they heard the firing of the other men on the trail. [...] The [...] "Thirsting Time" [...] was over for them. These fourteen men had gone for over eighty-six hours without any water in the desert heat. It was amazing they had survived. Nolan was not finished. He was missing men. After a rest, he sent out men with water to look for stragglers. They found some wandering horses that had been with the bison hunters. They made a diligent hunt for survivors and recovered what supplies they could. [...] Nolan was still missing men and he feared many were dead. [...] The men began to recover from their ordeal.|$|E
2500|$|If {{all this}} is true, then where do the world senses come in? The early empiricists all <b>stumbled</b> <b>over</b> this point. Hume {{asserted}} that all knowledge comes from the senses, and then gave away the ballgame by excepting abstract propositions, which he called [...] "relations of ideas". These, he said, were absolutely true (although the mathematicians who thought them up, being human, might get them wrong). Mill, on the other hand, tried to deny that abstract ideas exist outside the physical world: all numbers, he said, [...] "must be numbers of something: {{there are no such}} things as numbers in the abstract". When we count to eight or add five and three we are really counting spoons or bumblebees. [...] "All things possess quantity", he said, so that propositions concerning numbers are propositions concerning [...] "all things whatever". But then in almost a contradiction of himself he went on to acknowledge that numerical and algebraic expressions are not necessarily attached to real world objects: they [...] "do not excite in our minds ideas of any things in particular". Mill's low reputation as a philosopher of logic, and the low estate of empiricism in the century and a half following him, derives from this failed attempt to link abstract thoughts to the physical world, when it may be more plausibly arguable that abstraction consists precisely of separating the thought from its physical foundations.|$|E
