Metoyer responded: [...] "I don't know if I <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> ! Isn't that one of those great industry secrets? Let's just say that when you're doing a live record, you want live sound — even if perhaps the microphones didn't pick up the audience properly." ...|$|E

Houston Chronicles Michael D. Clark described the track as [...] "overwrought and overproduced; at best, it's a future prom theme".

A writer for Billboard magazine commented that the song lacked the potential to become a chart-topper. He went on to describe it as a [...] "schmaltzy AC ballad aiming to display the individual talents" [...] of Destiny's Child's members, adding that it was [...] "ironic" [...] as the group's other songs on the disc focused mainly on production. He finished his review by saying that [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] was a [...] "disappointing nonstarter".|$|E
