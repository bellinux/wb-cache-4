25|$|The Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts {{issued on}} 24 June 2000 a {{declaration}} {{on the application}} of canon 915 of the Code of Canon Law to divorced Catholics who have civilly remarried. Even if such people, while being unable for <b>serious</b> <b>reasons,</b> such as the upbringing of children, to separate, live in full continence, their publicly known objective situation as divorced and remarried Catholics excludes them from receiving Eucharistic Communion. Public denial of Communion must be avoided and so the reasons for exclusion must be explained to them, but if such precautionary measures fail to obtain the desired effect or are impossible, Communion {{is not to be}} given to them.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the noisier public protests, boycotts, and bottles being emptied into the streets of Southern cities, the company had more <b>serious</b> <b>reasons</b> to be concerned. Its bottlers, {{and not just the}} ones still suing the company over syrup pricing policies, were expressing concern. While they had given Goizueta a standing ovation when he announced the change at an April 22 bottlers' meeting at Atlanta's Woodruff Arts Center, glad the company had finally taken some initiative in the face of Pepsi's advances, they were less enthusiastic about the taste. [...] Most of them saw great difficulty having to promote and sell a drink that had long been marketed as [...] "The Real Thing", constant and unchanging, now that it had been changed.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} will not think it an impertinent question; but--there {{must have been some}} very <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> to have kept you apart so long?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not she! You mark my words," [...] said Joseph, [...] "there's {{some very}} <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> for her keeping her room, on pretense of being ill." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Code instituted for {{the first}} time in an Arab Muslim country the {{principle}} of the consent of the two spouses as a requirement for the validity of all marriages. Furthermore, it instituted an obligatory minimum age for marriages, fixed first at eighteen years for men and fifteen years for women, the precise text that: [...] "Below this age marriage cannot be contracted, except by the special authorization of a judge who may not grant it, except for <b>serious</b> <b>reasons</b> and in the well understood interests of both spouses. In this same case, consent for the marriage of a minor must be given by the closest parent who must fulfil three conditions, namely being of sound mind, adult and masculine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are <b>serious</b> <b>reasons</b> for my {{keeping up}} appearances," [...] she said. [...] "I shall {{go in the}} carriage. You mustn't go at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I have reasons," [...] Lady Janet rejoined, [...] "for {{wishing to}} speak to you about Grace before you see her; <b>serious</b> <b>reasons.</b> Sit down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be offended, my dear. I believe Miss Dunross {{has some}} more <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> for keeping her face hidden than {{the reason that}} she gave you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good morning,' {{she replied}} gravely. 'Mr. Bealand, I have a <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> for {{asking you to}} meet me--us, I may say. We wish you to marry us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Try, madam, {{to bear in}} {{mind that}} no unhappy creature, in my place, would expose herself to your anger and {{contempt}} without a <b>serious</b> <b>reason.</b> Will you think again?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mercy {{considered}} {{before she}} answered him. With the object {{she had in}} view, there might be <b>serious</b> <b>reasons</b> for speaking with extreme caution when she spoke of Grace.|$|E
6000|$|Randal {{changed his}} tone. [...] "We have amused {{ourselves}} long enough," [...] he said. [...] "I have <b>serious</b> <b>reasons,</b> Sarrazin, for wishing {{to know what}} passed between Miss Westerfield and you--and I trust my old friend to relieve my anxiety." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{persisted in}} working, as industriously {{as if she}} had been a poor needlewoman, with <b>serious</b> <b>reasons</b> for being eager to get her money. [...] "It is useless," [...] she replied, [...] "to speak of what cannot be for some time to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you speak}} of your married life," [...] said Penrose, [...] "your tone is the tone of a {{disappointed}} man. Have you any <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> to complain of Mrs. Romayne?" ...|$|R
60|$|THERE WAS a more <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> than Bervie {{was aware}} of, at the time, for the warning {{which he had}} thought it his duty to address to Percy Linwood. The new footman who had entered Mr. Bowmore's service was a Spy.|$|R
5000|$|For a <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> requiring, {{in case of}} doubt, the Bishop's approval, passive {{or merely}} {{material}} presence at non-Catholic funerals, weddings and similar occasions because of holding a civil office or as a courtesy can be tolerated, provided there is no danger of perversion or scandal.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Later {{in the day}} I warned my lord, as {{gently as}} I could, that his time had come. I am {{informed}} that there are <b>serious</b> <b>reasons</b> for my stating what passed between us on this occasion, in detail, and without any reserve. I comply with the request.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{apparently}} forget, Lady Janet, {{that you}} are not speaking to one of your footmen," [...] he said. [...] "There are <b>serious</b> <b>reasons</b> (of which you know nothing) for my remaining in your house a little longer. You may rely upon my trespassing on your hospitality as short a time as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are well}} advised, {{exceedingly}} well advised," [...] Spencer said. [...] "Mind I {{do not take}} the responsibility of sending you away without <b>serious</b> <b>reasons.</b> I honestly believe that Miss Poynton is safe, whatever may have happened to her brother, and I believe that you will serve her best by your temporary absence." ...|$|E

60|$|His face plainly {{showed that}} there was a <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> for his strange proposal. Magdalen secured her {{collection}} of cosmetics and followed him into the dressing-room. He locked the door, placed her on a chair close to the light, and then told her what had happened.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{experiments}} all {{led to the}} conclusion that the Feulgen reaction is a valuable test for the in situ localization of thymonucleic acid: there is thus no <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> to doubt that this acid is a constituent of chromatin and chromosomes. © 1946 Birkhäuser Verlag.

6000|$|... "Then, my dear, {{it will be}} my duty to {{take you}} and your maid away from this house, and to tell your father what <b>serious</b> <b>reasons</b> there are"---- He {{abruptly}} checked himself. Mrs. Vimpany had returned; she was in perfect possession of her lofty courtesy, sweetened by the modest dignity of her smile.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Keller {{rose from}} his chair. Whatever her true motives might be, it was now {{perfectly}} plain that she was concealing them from him. [...] "If you have any more <b>serious</b> <b>reasons</b> to give me than these," [...] he said quietly and coldly, [...] "let me hear them between this and post-time tomorrow. In the meanwhile, I need not detain you any longer." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{attendant}} circumstances, however, {{are not so}} easy to discover. Judging by {{the careful}} report of the person whom I employ, there must have been <b>serious</b> <b>reasons,</b> in this case, for keeping facts secret and witnesses out of the way. I mention this, not to discourage you, but to prepare you for delays that may occur on our way to discovery.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} you have <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> to {{complain}} of some man of rank and title?" [...] I said. [...] "I am afraid the baronet, whose name you {{are unwilling to}} mention to me, has done you some grievous wrong? Is he the cause of your being out here at this strange time of night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Letitia," [...] he pleaded, [...] "there is a door there {{which leads}} into the hall. You don't expect manners of me, anyway, {{but could you}} accept my {{farewell}} and excuse me to the others? I have really a <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> for wishing to leave--a reason connected with the note I received at dinner time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 1. 42. Whether the {{poisoned}} shaft {{lights on}} a heart made callous by many blows. Shelley, in this expression, {{has no doubt}} himself in view. He had had <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> for complaining of the treatment meted out {{to him by the}} Quarterly Review: see the opening (partially cited at p. 17) of his draft-letter to the Editor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Tavernake, {{you must}} not--you must not refuse me," [...] she pleaded. [...] "If you only knew the {{importance}} of it, you would not hesitate for a moment. This is no idle curiosity on my part. I have reasons, very <b>serious</b> <b>reasons</b> indeed, for wishing to discover that poor girl's whereabouts at once. There is a possible danger of which she must be warned. No one can do it except myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eunice {{will be here}} soon," [...] he proceeded, [...] "and I {{ought to}} explain why I have sent {{for her to come}} and meet you. I have reasons, <b>serious</b> <b>reasons,</b> mind, for wishing you to compare her {{personal}} appearance with Helena's personal appearance, and then to tell me which of the two, on a fair comparison, looks the eldest. Pray bear in mind that I attach the greatest importance to the conclusion at which you may arrive." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{the utmost}} delicacy, but with perfect truthfulness {{at the same}} time, Carmina {{revealed}} to her betrothed husband the <b>serious</b> <b>reasons</b> which had forced her to withdraw herself from his mother's care. Bound to speak at last in her own defence, she felt that concealments and compromises would be alike unworthy of Ovid and of herself. What she had already written to Teresa, she now wrote again--with but one modification. She expressed herself forbearingly towards Ovid's mother. The closing words of the letter were worthy of Carmina's gentle, just, and generous nature.|$|E
6000|$|... "After being {{laughed at}} and insulted and denied, I was glad," [...] said the miserable wretch, [...] "to see {{that some of}} you had <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> to wish me back again. It rests with you, Miss Naomi, to keep me here, and to persuade me to save Ambrose by showing myself and owning to my name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} that need alarm you," [...] he replied. [...] "Catherine is too good and too true herself to suspect others easily. She sees a change in you that she doesn't understand--she asks if I have noticed it--and that is all. But her mother has the cunning of the devil. There is a <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> for {{controlling}} yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me for venturing to interfere," [...] he said [...] "There is a <b>serious</b> <b>reason</b> {{for what}} I have done, which I will {{explain to you}} at a fitter time. In the {{meanwhile}} I offer no further obstruction to the course which you propose taking. On the contrary, I have just assisted you in gaining the end {{that you have in}} view." ...|$|R
