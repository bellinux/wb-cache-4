5000|$|Moneybomb (alternatively money bomb, money-bomb, or {{fundraising}} bomb) is a neologism coined in 2007 {{to describe}} a grassroots fundraising effort over a brief fixed time period, usually to support a candidate for election by dramatically increasing, concentrating, and publicizing fundraising activity during a <b>specific</b> <b>hour</b> or day. The term was coined by Trevor Lyman {{to describe a}} massive coordinated online donation drive on behalf of presidential candidate Ron Paul, in which context the San Jose Mercury News described a moneybomb as being [...] "a one-day fundraising frenzy". The effort combines traditional and Internet-based fundraising appeals focusing especially on viral advertising through online vehicles such as YouTube, Myspace, and online forums. In the case of lesser-known candidates it is also intended to generate significant free mass media coverage the candidate would otherwise not receive. Moneybombs {{have been used for}} grassroots fundraising and viral activism over the Internet by several 2008 presidential candidates in the United States.

5000|$|Briefly stated, {{a paradox}} is an {{apparently}} true statement {{or group of}} statements that seems {{to lead to a}} contradiction or to a situation that defies intuition. It is said to be resolved when we show that the contradiction is only apparent. Kierkegaard's story of Abraham in Fear and Trembling exhibits such a paradox. Abraham could not prove he had heard the voice of God, yet he believes, and risked his only son based on this belief. The paradox of Abraham is that the believer acts and risks much on less than complete knowledge (incomplete knowledge is not sufficient for faith for Kierkegaard; one must believe by virtue of the absurd, that is to say because something is a contradiction). The god in time is a paradox just as much as the statement that [...] "God is love" [...] is a parody for an individual existing in time. Was it so easy for Abraham, Job, and the Apostle Paul to continue to believe that God is love? Kierkegaard continually stresses the tension between the inner and outer self before God. What a human being knows by himself about love is very superficial; he must come to know the deeper love from God-that is, in self-denial he must become what every human being can become (since self-denial is related to the universally human and thus is distinguished from the particular call and election), an instrument for God. Thus every human being can come to know everything about love, just as every human being can come to know that he, like every human being, is loved by God. Some find this thought adequate for the longest life (which doesn’t seem surprising to me); so even at the age of seventy they do not think that they have marveled over it enough, whereas others find this thought so insignificant (which seems to me very strange and deplorable), since to be loved by God is no more than every human being is-as if it were therefore less significant. The work of praising love must be done outwardly in self-sacrificing unselfishness. Through self-denial a human being gains the ability to be an instrument by inwardly making himself into nothing before God. Through self-sacrificing unselfishness he outwardly makes himself into nothing, an unworthy servant. Inwardly he does not become self-important, since he is nothing, and outwardly he does not become self-important either, since he is nothing before God - and he does not forget that right where he is he is before God. Alas, it can happen that a person makes a mistake at the last moment, in that he, though truly humble before God, becomes proud of what he is able to do as he turns toward people. It is then a temptation of comparison that becomes his downfall. He understood that he could not compare himself to God; before him he became conscious of himself as a nothing; but in comparison with people he still thought himself to be something. That is, he forgot the self-denial; he is trapped in an illusion, as if he were before God only during specific hours, just as one has an audience with His Royal Majesty at a <b>specific</b> <b>hour.</b> Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love 1847, Hong 1995 p. 364-365 ...|$|E

3000|$|Another {{approach}} {{adopted to}} ascertain naturalness was to analyse {{the values of}} elements. We focused on two areas: (a) textual content analysis to assess aspects such as {{whether or not it}} is natural to maintain consistent values (e.g., age or name) across profiles or if values typically tend to match the ground truth (e.g., real age); and (b) frequency analysis of numeric elements (e.g., number of posts, pictures uploaded) to calculate the range of potentially natural values (assuming a Gaussian distribution, ‘natural’ ranges could be the average value plus/minus the standard deviation). Findings from (a) included the fact that there is a clear majority tendency for individuals to have the same age and gender across profiles, but not similar locations or usernames. As it pertains to (b) and Facebook for instance, we found that personae tend to post more during the evening and less during the morning, but there is not a <b>specific</b> <b>hour</b> where they mostly publish.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis examines determinants {{affecting the}} marginal price of electricity on day ahead spot market in Czech Republic based on hourly data from January 1 st 2010 to December 31 st 2011. The influence of every explanatory variable {{used in the}} model was proven. Majority of the significant fluctuations {{is caused by the}} time factor (<b>specific</b> <b>hour,</b> day of the week). The price during the weekdays is on the average higher by 41 % than during Sunday, 22 % higher in Saturday. In accordance with former assumptions increase of the long-term price/the settlement price of system imbalance (by 1 EUR) causes increase of the marginal price (by 0. 03 / 1 %). The same effect can be recognized in case of higher volume of planned outages (increase by 100 MWh causes increase of marginal price by 0. 3 %). While we consider the influence of temperatures, the lowest price is at 14. 2 °C; when the temperature falls to - 5 °C the price is about 13. 7 % higher; when the temperature rises to 23. 9 °C it is about 6 % higher.

40|$|Recent {{analysis}} {{regarding the}} patterns {{and composition of}} trips in morning peak hour revealed that an increasing part of these trips correspond to non-work related trips. In general, these trips are not specifically associated with morning peak. Other studies show that price elasticity of leisure trips is considerably {{higher than that of}} commuting and business trips. According to Wardrop’s first principle, if the transportation network maintains equilibrium, then no user could improve his situation by selecting alternative travel route. Expanding on that principle, the fact that non-work related trips (such as shopping, family visits, tourism) take place in the morning peak hour, under congestion conditions, means that the <b>specific</b> <b>hour,</b> not only the duration of time and trip purpose, is important to the user. Hence, each hour of the day has its own intrinsic value, named “Intrinsic Hourly Value ” (IVH). In order to estimate this value, calibration of a multi-hour equilibrium assignment is suggested to determine the magnitude and characteristics of the IVH. Several hypotheses have been tested with regard to the IVH. For example, significant positive values were estimated for morning IVH. The methodology was applied using a symbolic network. A clear method to estimate the IVH is presented. The results can assist public authorities to decide on policies such as activities time rescheduling or the application of congestion tolls...|$|E
40|$|Price {{volatility}} {{analysis has}} been reported in the literature for most competitive electricity markets around the world. However, no studies have been published yet that quantify price volatility in the Ontario electricity market, which is the focus of the present paper. In this paper, a comparative volatility analysis is conducted for the Ontario market and its neighboring electricity markets. Volatility indices are developed based on historical volatility and price velocity concepts, previously applied to other electricity market prices, and employed in the present work. The analysis is carried out in two scenarios: in the first scenario, the volatility indices are determined for the entire price time series. In the second scenario, the price time series are broken up into 24 time series for each of the 24 h and volatility indices are calculated for each <b>specific</b> <b>hour</b> separately. The volatility indices are also applied to the locational marginal prices of several pricing points in the New England, New York, and PJM electricity markets. The outcomes reveal that price volatility is significantly higher in Ontario than the three studied neighboring electricity markets. Furthermore, comparison of {{the results of this study}} with similar findings previously published for 15 other electricity markets demonstrates that the Ontario electricity market is one of the most volatile electricity markets world-wide. This high volatility is argued to be associated with the fact that Ontario is a single-settlement, real-time market...|$|E

Small white circles indicate a difference that is outside the error bars defined by the standard error of the mean.

More precisely, the interval of working hours is defined by the period between 8 am and 16 pm (inclusive) on weekdays (from Monday to Friday). The periods of social hours are defined by the rest of the 168 hours of the week. The social core shows decreased activity during working hours compared to the proximity driven group, and they are more active in the evening and nights as well as during the weekend (especially Monday night and Thursday evening). Also note that for most of the days (from Monday to Saturday), hours in the early morning display significant differences from the proximity driven group, suggesting that the behavior of the social core deviates from the rest of the population predominantly during working hours and nights.|$|E
