5|$|In {{autoimmunity}} {{the immune}} system wrongly recognizes certain native molecules in the body as foreign (<b>self-antigen),</b> and mounts an immune response against them. Since these native molecules, as normal parts of the body, will naturally always exist in the body, the attacks against them can get stronger over time (akin to secondary immune response). Moreover, many organisms exhibit molecular mimicry, which involves showing those antigens on their surface that are antigenically similar to the host proteins. This has two possible consequences: first, either the organism will be spared as a self antigen; or secondly, that the antibodies produced against it will also bind to the mimicked native proteins. The antibodies will attack the self-antigens and the tissues harboring them by activating various mechanisms like the complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Hence, wider the range of antibody-specificities, greater the chance that {{one or the other}} will react against self-antigens (native molecules of the body).|$|E

40|$|Although immediate-Type I skin {{reactions}} to human dander {{have been described}} six decades ago, only the recent application of molecular biology to allergology research allowed fast and detailed characterization of IgE-binding autoantigens. These can be functionally subdivided into three classes: (1) <b>self-antigens</b> with sequence homology to environmental allergens belonging to the class of phylogenetically conserved proteins, (2) <b>self-antigens</b> without sequence homology to known environmental allergens, and (3) chemically modified <b>self-antigens</b> deriving from workplace exposure. As environmental allergens, also IgE-binding autoantigens belong to different protein families without common structural features that would explain their IgE-binding capability. Many of the <b>self-antigens</b> showing sequence homology to environmental allergens, are phylogenetically conserved proteins like manganese dependent superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin or cyclopilin. Their IgE-binding capability {{can be explained by}} molecular mimicry resulting from shared B-cell epitopes. A common factor of IgE-binding <b>self-antigens</b> without sequence homology to known environmental allergens is that they elicit IgE responses only in individuals suffering from long-lasting atopic diseases. In contrast, IgE-mediated {{reactions to}} modified <b>self-antigens</b> might be explained with the generation of novel B-cell epitopes. Chemically modified <b>self-antigens</b> are likely to be recognized as non-self by the immune system. The clinical relevance of IgE responses to <b>self-antigens</b> remains largely unclear. Well documented is their ability to induce immediate Type I skin reactions in vivo, and to induce mediator release from effector cells of sensitized individuals in vitro. Based on these observations {{it is reasonable to assume}} that IgE-mediated cross-linking of FcRIε receptors on effector cells can elicit the same symptoms as those induced by environmental allergens, and this could explain exacerbations of chronic allergic diseases in the absence of external exposure.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Atopic eczema (AE) is {{the most}} common chronic {{inflammatory}} skin disease. Recent data demonstrate the presence of autoreactive serum IgE antibodies correlating with the severity of the disease. OBJECTIVE: Although several IgE-binding <b>self-antigens</b> have been reported, the whole repertoire of IgE-binding <b>self-antigens</b> is unknown. We aimed to estimate the repertoire size of autoreactive proteins related to AE and clone, produce, and characterize humoral and T-cell responses against novel <b>self-antigens.</b> METHODS: Phage surface-displayed human cDNA libraries were enriched for clones binding to serum IgE from patients with AE and screened by using high-throughput technology. Selected clones were used to produce the encoded proteins, to test their IgE-binding ability in Western blots and ELISAs, and their ability to induce mediator release from basophils of sensitized individuals. RESULTS: One hundred forty sequences encoding potential IgE-binding <b>self-antigens</b> associated with AE were identified. Sixteen sequences encoded already described <b>self-antigens.</b> Three new sequences showed homology with environmental allergens, 86 encoded known human proteins, 7 predicted proteins, and 28 showed sequence identity with genomic contigs. Immunoblotting and ELISA experiments demonstrated the presence of IgE antibodies in sera from patients with AE to 5 selected recombinant <b>self-antigens</b> and their ability to induce mediator release from basophils of patients with AE who have self-antigen-specific IgE antibodies. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate a broad spectrum of at least 140 IgE-binding <b>self-antigens</b> associated with AE.

50|$|B cells undergo {{two types}} of {{selection}} while developing in the bone marrow to ensure proper development. Positive selection occurs through antigen-independent signaling involving both the pre-BCR and the BCR.

Negative selection occurs through the binding of <b>self-antigen</b> with the BCR; If the BCR can bind strongly to <b>self-antigen,</b> then the B cell undergoes one of four fates: clonal deletion, receptor editing, anergy, or ignorance (B cell ignores signal and continues development).

50|$|B and T {{lymphocytes}} {{are tested}} for their affinity for self MHC/peptide complexes {{before leaving the}} primary lymphoid organs and entering into the periphery. If they demonstrate high affinity for <b>self-antigen,</b> one method of preventing autoimmunity is through clonal deletion. This is where the lymphocyte would receive apoptotic signals from antigen-presenting cell (APCs). It {{is important to note}} that not all lymphocytes expressing high affinity for <b>self-antigen</b> undergo clonal deletion. B lymphocytes can also participate in light chain receptor editing, VH gene replacement, or be released and later undergo negative selection in the periphery. T lymphocytes can instead undergo clonal arrest, clonal anergy, and clonal editing. If autoreactive cells escape clonal deletion in either the thymus or the bone marrow, there are mechanisms in the periphery involving T regulatory cells to prevent the host from obtaining an autoimmune disease. However, for both B and T cells in the primary lymphoid organs, clonal deletion is the most common form of negative selection.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{mechanisms}} underlying the natural tolerance of thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes for <b>self-antigens.</b> Lymphocytes from the thymus or lymph nodes of inbred rats were autosensitized in vitro against monolayers of autochthonous thymus reticulum cells or syngeneic fibroblasts. Receptors for <b>self-antigens</b> were detected by the specific adherence of normal lymphocytes to syngeneic cells. The achievement of active cell-mediated autosensitization was assayed {{by measuring the}} immunospecific lysis of syngeneic target cells in vitro, or graft-versus-host (GvH) reactions in vivo. The following observations were made using these systems. (a) A fraction of normal lymphocytes {{was found to have}} specific surface receptors that are able to recognize <b>self-antigens</b> which seem to be accessible in vivo. These potentially self-reactive lymphocytes were activated by incubation with syngeneic or autochthonous cells in vitro. Hence, the elimination of potentially self-reactive lymphocytes cannot be the only basis for natural self-tolerance. Therefore, the maintenance of self-tolerance in vivo appears to involve suppression of the immune reactivity of such self-tolerant lymphocytes. (b) We found that control of autosensitization depends upon the inhibition of the recognition of <b>self-antigens.</b> A GvH reaction in vivo could not be suppressed once recognition of <b>self-antigens</b> had occurred in vitro. Moreover, studies of the kinetics of antigen recognition indicated that several hours of incubation in vitro were needed for the inactivation of factors specifically inhibiting self-recognition. (c) We found that factors which inhibit self-recognition are present in fresh autologous serum. Treatment of the lymphocytes, but not syngeneic adsorbing cells, with autologous serum prevented recognition of syngeneic antigens. Allogeneic serum did not prevent self-recognition, and autologous serum did not inhibit the recognition of foreign antigens. These findings indicate that natural tolerance of T lymphocytes to <b>self-antigens</b> can be regulated by serum factors which act on the lymphocytes. The immunospecificity of the inhibitory effect suggests that these factors may be soluble <b>self-antigens</b> in a tolerogenic form...|$|R
40|$|The key {{function}} {{of the immune system}} is to promptly signal danger by invading pathogens, while ignoring <b>self-antigens,</b> in which the immune cells are bathed.

However, the physical isolation of eye antigens results in the body's T cells never having encountered them {{at any time during}} development.Studies in mice have shown that the lack of presentation of eye <b>self-antigens</b> to specific T cells will fail to induce a sufficient amount of anergy to the <b>self-antigens.</b> While the lack of antigen presentation (due to the physical barriers) is sufficient to prevent the activation of autoreactive immune cells to the eye, the failure to induce sufficient anergy to T cells has detrimental results. In the case of damage or chance presentation to the immune system, the antigen presentation and immune response will occur at elevated rates.|$|R

50|$|The {{association}} of AS with HLA-B27 suggests the condition involves CD8 T cells, which interact with HLA-B.

There is, however, a possibility that CD4+ T lymphocytes are involved in an aberrant way, since HLA-B27 appears to have a number of unusual properties, including possibly an ability to interact with T cell receptors in association with CD4 (usually CD8+ cytotoxic T cell with HLAB antigen as it is a MHC class 1 antigen).|$|E
40|$|Natural {{tolerance}} to <b>self-antigens</b> is a haUmark {{of the immune}} system.

50|$|In {{autoimmunity}} {{the immune}} system wrongly recognizes certain native molecules in the body as foreign (<b>self-antigen),</b> and mounts an immune response against them.

Moreover, many organisms exhibit molecular mimicry, which involves showing those antigens on their surface that are antigenically similar to the host proteins. This has two possible consequences: first, either the organism will be spared as a self antigen; or secondly, that the antibodies produced against it will also bind to the mimicked native proteins.

This peripheral priming was independent of the subcellular localization of the <b>self-antigen,</b> indicating that this mechanism may apply to other melanocyte-associated antigens. Hence, central tolerance by promiscuous expression of peripheral antigens is a mandatory, rather than a superfluous, mechanism to counteract the peripheral priming, at least for self-antigens that can be directly presented in lymph nodes.

By contrast, relatively {{little is known about the}} genes and pathways involved in immunological tolerance to <b>self-antigens.</b> Here, we describe the challenges associated with a genomewide screen designed at identifying new immune regulatory genes that uses a model of organ-specific autoimmunity leading to type 1 diabetes. The successful propagation and identification of the new gene variants will shed light on the various developmental checkpoints in lymphocyte development that are crucial for establishing tolerance to <b>self-antigens...</b>|$|R
