40|$|In {{the recent}} times' fatty acid methyl ester popularly called as {{biodiesel}} {{has become more}} prominent alternate fuel {{for compression ignition engines}} based on a <b>single</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>concept.</b> Since, use of neat biodiesel on a large scale is raising certain difficulties and is being adopted in a blended form with petro-diesel fuel and B 20 blend has become standardized. However, the HC and NOx emissions of B 20 are still on the higher side. Present work aims at experimental evaluation of a single cylinder water-cooled diesel engine by adopting various proportions of ethanol and diethyl ether blends in order to improve performance and emission characteristics of B 20 blend. Besides employing different amounts of ethanol and diethyl ether, simultaneous influence of injector nozzle hole size and fuel injection pressure are also investigated to arrive at an optimum configuration. Brake specific fuel consumption and hydrocarbon emissions values are lower with B 20 and DEE 5 whereas B 20 with DEE 15 yielded lower NOx emissions. It is observed that addition of oxygenates have improved the combustion process and lower emissions are obtained. The present investigation revealed that blends with oxygenated additives having higher Cetane rating are superior to neat blend...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION ON THE EFFECT OF INTAKE CHARGE TEMPERATURE AND INJECTION TIMING ON AUTOIGNITION OF LOW CETANE NUMBER FUEL (SASOL IPK) by SWAPNIL S BODELE May 2016 Advisor: Dr. Naeim Henein Major: Mechanical Engineering Degree: Master of Science Although {{diesel engines}} are {{considered}} the best powerhouses for their heavy-duty capabilities, concerns have been raised because of their emission issues. Alternative fuels like jet fuels can be substitute to them for improved efficiencies. The Department Of Defense uses JP 8 for their combat vehicles under their <b>Single</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Concept</b> for a better logistic supply chain. However, due to the projected age of depletion of crude oil reservoirs, synthetic blends are being considered for their abundant availability. One such blend, SASOL IPK, a Coal to Liquid based fuel prepared by the Fisher- Tropsch process is considered in this study. This thesis shows results from experiments conducted on single cylinder PNGV engine to study the effect of intake charge temperature and injection timing on ignition delay of SASOL IPK. Speed, fuel injection pressure, swirl ratio and charge density were kept constant for all data points. Two cases were considered, one with constant SOI and varying intake air temperature {{and the other with}} constant intake air temperature and varying SOI. It was observed that with an increase in intake air temperature and advancing injection timing, ignition delay of the fuel reduced significantly. NTC regime and cool flame also decreased drastically at higher intake air temperatures and advanced injection timing...|$|E
40|$|The use of kerosene-based {{jet fuels}} for all {{military}} applications has been mandated by U. S. military’s <b>single</b> <b>fuel</b> forward <b>concept.</b> Recently, interest in non-petroleum-derived alternative jet fuels {{has also been}} increasing {{as a way to}} diversify the source of jet fuels. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with detailed kinetic modeling can be used to model the combustion behavior of real fuel and predict their performance. This thesis revolves around the development of a surrogate mixture for real jet fuels, kinetic models for the surrogate components, and CFD simulations of diesel engines to assess the effects of surrogate’s chemical and physical properties on fundamental combustion processes. Fuel surrogates are mixtures of one or more simple fuels that are designed to emulate key properties of a more complex fuel. For the first time we report on a comprehensive jet fuel surrogates that successfully emulate physical and chemical properties of conventional and alternative jet fuels. To identify the target properties that need to be used to reproduce the diesel combustion, {{in the first part of}} this dissertation, a sensitivity analysis was conducted with CFD simulations of pure n-dodecane spray in a constant volume chamber to identify temperature dependent liquid physical properties that are of significance to the diesel ignition process. Out of six physical properties that were tested, density, viscosity, volatility, and specific heat showed major impact on liquid penetration length and ignition delay time. Using a six-component surrogate palette (n-dodecane, n-decane, iso-cetane, iso-octane, decalin, and toluene), the surrogate optimizer generated surrogate mixtures for Jet-A POSF- 4658, a petroleum-derived conventional jet fuel, IPK POSF- 5642, a coal-derived synthetic jet fuel, and S- 8 POSF- 4734, a natural-gas-derived synthetic jet fuel. Kinetic modeling of the surrogate fuels were enabled by a detailed chemical mechanism. Numerical experiments were conducted using CFD simulations to evaluate the importance of physical and chemical properties of surrogates on the ignition process of the fuel spray for two fuels. This study indicates that the chemical properties of fuel are much more important to the duration of the ignition delay period than the physical properties, which emphasizes the chemical aspect of the diesel ignition phenomena...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, NATO and U. S. {{military}} forces {{have decided to}} implement a single fuel (JP- 8) for all land-based military aircraft, vehicles, and equipment during war and peace times. This {{is referred to as}} the single fuel forward concept. However, possible environmental pollution problems have been identified in the process of implementing this <b>single</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>concept.</b> This work presents data on the operational and, especially, environmental evaluation of the JP- 8 fuel that is burned in diesel engines and furnaces. The investigation is conducted in a comparative manner between the JP- 8 fuel and the proverbial Diesel Oil No. 2, which is being substituted. The two fuels were burned under identical conditions in disparate types of combustors, including direct injection (DI) and indirect injection (IDI) diesel engines as well as a laminar-flow muffle furnace. The primary goal was to contrast the emissions of the two fuels, because JP- 8 is a substitute for diesel oil in military applications, such as engines of ground vehicles and power generators, as well as other burners. Regulated emissions of CO, particulate matter (soot), oxides of nitrogen, and total unburned hydrocarbons have been examined. In the case of the combustion of the two fuels in the furnace, unregulated organic compounds have also been monitored. Moreover, the operational behaviors of the two fuels in the engines have been discussed. Results demonstrated that, for both fuels, the magnitude of the emissions, as well as the trends with operating conditions, were influenced by the type of combustor. However, the emissions from the two fuels, when burned in the same combustor, were comparable overall, both qualitatively and quantitatively. © 2004 American Chemical Society...|$|E

The collected data {{have been used to}} produce iso-contours of thermal efficiency, volumetric efficiency, specific oxides of nitrogen (NOX), specific hydrocarbons (HC) and specific carbon dioxide (CO 2) on a power-speed plane.

The {{paper was}} to {{investigate}} the development of the graphite/phenolic resin composite materials that were fabricated by compression molding for the bipolar plate of the fuel cell. Effect of the different amounts of resin and the graphite powder size on the porosity, density, bending strength, and electrical resistance of the composites would be analyzed. In addition, the composites of the bipolar plates would be machined into the groove channel using high speed milling, which then assembles into <b>single</b> <b>fuel</b> cell. The I-V performance of the <b>single</b> <b>fuel</b> cell would be also discussed. The experimental results showed that when the larger amount of resin was employed, the resulting composites had a lower porosity, a larger electrical resistance, and a higher bending strength.

40|$|Naval {{aviation}} turbine fuel, JP- 5, {{has been}} accepted as alternative to JP- 8 {{in the frame of}} the <b>Single</b> <b>Fuel</b> Policy. This has resulted in some ongoing research on JP- 5 fuel for its application as a naval <b>single</b> <b>fuel.</b> The necessity to cope with the environmental problems identified in the process of implementing the <b>Single</b> <b>Fuel</b> Policy as well as the strict requirements of modern diesel engines has lead to the need of improved <b>single</b> <b>fuel</b> quality. The development of biomass derived substitutes for diesel, such as biodiesel, is a possible attractive solution. The present paper is an effort to evaluate JP- 5 along with diesel and biodiesel for use in a diesel engine. These fuels were used alone and in various mixture fractions in a single cylinder stationary diesel engine in order to evaluate their performance under defined operating conditions of the engine. JP- 5 reduced both the NOx and particulate matter emissions as compared to the reference fuel case. Biodiesel significantly lowered particulate emissions, but slightly increased NOx emissions and fuel consumption. Fuel Sulfur content has an undesired effect on smoke opacity. Biodiesel increased the fuel consumption when added to petroleum fuels and the increase was larger at high engine loads. Diesel and JP- 5 showed similar fuel consumption, with diesel consumption increasing at high engine loads. Ternary blends showed similar behavior. The blends with lower biodiesel content showed lower volumetric fuel consumption. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The concepts were explored for both high- and low-conversion core configurations, and metal and oxide fuels. The annular <b>fuel</b> <b>concept</b> is best suited for low-conversion metal-fuelled cores, where it can enable a power uprate of ~ 20 %; the magnitude of the uprate is limited by the fuel clad chemical interaction temperature constraint during a hypothetical flow blockage of the inner-annular channel. The bottle-shaped <b>fuel</b> <b>concept</b> is best suited for tight high-conversion ratio cores, where it can reduce the overall core pressure drop in the fuel channels by > 30 %, with a corresponding increase in core height between 15 and 18 %. A full-plant RELAP 5 - 3 D model was created to evaluate the transient performance of the innovative fuel configurations during the station blackout and unprotected transient over power. The transient analysis confirmed the good thermal-hydraulic performance of the annular and bottle-shaped fuel designs with respect to the reference case with traditional solid fuel pins.

40|$|When {{natural gas}} is port/manifold {{injected}} into a compression ignition engine, the mixture of air and the {{natural gas is}} compressed during the compression stroke of the engine. Due to {{the difference in the}} values of specific heat capacity ratio between air and natural gas, the temperature and pressure at the time of pilot fuel injection are different when compared to a case where only air is compressed. Also, the presence of natural gas affects the peak in-cylinder (adiabatic flame) temperature. This significantly affects the performance as well as emissions characteristics of natural gas based dual fueling in CI engine. Natural gas has been extensively tested in a single cylinder compression ignition engine to obtain performance and emissions maps. Two pilot fuels, diesel and RME, have been used to pilot natural gas combustion. The performance of the two liquid fuels used as pilots has also been assessed and compared. Tests were conducted at 48 different operating conditions (six different speeds and eight different power output conditions for each speed) for <b>single</b> <b>fueling</b> cases. Both the diesel and RME based <b>single</b> <b>fueling</b> cases were used as baselines to compare the natural gas based dual fueling where data was collected at 36 operating conditions (six different speeds and six different power output conditions for each speed). Performance and emissions characteristics were mapped on speed vs brake power plots. The thermal efficiency values of the natural gas dual fueling were lower when compared to the respective pilot <b>fuel</b> based <b>single</b> <b>fueling</b> apart from the highest powers. The effect of engine speed on volumetric efficiency in case of the natural gas based dual fueling was significantly different from what was observed with the <b>single</b> <b>fueling.</b> Contours of specific NOX for diesel and RME based <b>single</b> <b>fueling</b> differ significantly when these fuels were used to pilot natural gas combustion. For both of the <b>single</b> <b>fueling</b> cases, maximum specific NOX were centered at the intersection of medium speeds and medium powers and they decrease in all directions from this region of maximum values. On the other hand, an opposite trend was observed with dual fueling cases where minimum specific NOX were observed {{at the center of the}} map and they increase in all direction from this region of minimum NOX. RME piloted specific NOX at the highest speeds were the only exception to this trend. Higher specific HC and lower specific CO 2 emissions were observed in case of natural gas based dual fueling.
