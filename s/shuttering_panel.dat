Tehnološka dovršenost v slovenski lesnopredelovalni industriji ni nekaj povsem samoumevnega, obstaja pa zavedanje, da je za konkurenčnost panoge nujno potreben napredek. Naše delo in prispevek se dotikata vpeljave strojnega vida v proces avtomatizacija pri proizvodnji opažnih plošč. Ozko grlo v procesu izdelave je namreč ročno krpanje prisotnih grč, ena izmed ključnih komponent avtomatizacije takšnega sistema pa je dobra lokalizacija grč. V delu smo širše orisali problem segmentacije. Predlagali in ovrednotili smo metodo segmentacije na podlagi iskanja najmanjšega prereza oziroma največjega pretoka v grafu. Metoda na podlagi grobo lokalizirane grče določi modela verjetnostne porazdelitve mešanice Gaussov za grčo in ozadje. Na podlagi pridobljenih modelov določimo območne in mejne uteži ter izgradimo graf, pri tem pa področje izven grobe regije grče upoštevamo kot seme in ga pripišemo ozadju. Izračun minimalnega prereza grafa je hkrati rešitev segmentacije. Rezultat sta dve ločeni regiji, kjer ena pripada grči, druga pa lesu. Vrednotenje predlagane metode smo predstavili na zbirki grč, pridobljeni pri enem izmed slovenskih proizvajalcev opažnih plošč med procesom izdelave. Za potrebo validacije metode smo zbirko 119 grč primerno anotirali in jo ponujamo kot javno dobro.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} wood {{fingerprints}} and presents ways to track sawn wood products through an industrial process using cameras. The possibility to identify individual wood products {{comes from the}} biological variation of the trees, where the genetic code, environment and breakdown process creates a unique appearance for every board. This application has {{much of the same}} challenges as are found in human biometrics applications. The vision for the future {{is to be able to}} utilize existing imaging sensors in the production line to track individual products through a disordered and diverging product flow. The flow speed in wood industries is usually very high and with a high degree of automation. Wood fingerprints combined with automated inspection makes it possible to tailor subsequent processing steps for each product and can bring the operators vital feedback on process parameters. The motivation for this work comes from the wood industry wanting to keep track of products without invasive methods such as bar code stickers or painted labels. In the project Hol-i-Wood Patching Robot, an automatic scanner- and robot system is being developed, where there is a need to keep track of the <b>shuttering</b> <b>panels</b> that are going to be mended by several automatic robot systems. In this thesis, two different strategies to recognize previously scanned sawn wood products are presented. The first approach uses feature detectors to find matching features between two images. This approach proved to be robust even when subjected to moderate geometric- and radiometric image distortions. The recognition accuracy reached 100 % when matching high quality scans of Scots pine boards that have more than 20 knots. The second approach uses local knot neighborhood geometry to find point matches between images. The recognition accuracy reached above 99 % when matching simulated Scots pine panels with realistically added noise to the knot positions, whilst more than 85 % of the knots were found. Both presented approaches proved to be viable options for recognition of sawn wood products. In order to improve the recognition methods further, a larger dataset needs to be acquired and a method to calibrate parameter settings needs to be developed.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis deals with {{recognition}} of wood fingerprints extracted from timber surfaces. It presents different methods to track sawn wood products through an industrial process using cameras. The possibility of identifying individual wood products comes from the biological variation of trees, where the genetic code, environment, and breakdown process means that every board has a unique appearance. Wood fingerprint recognition experiences many of the same challenges as found in human biometrics applications.   The vision for the future {{is to be able to}} utilize existing imaging sensors in the production line to track individual products through a disordered and diverging product flow. The flow speed in wood industries is usually very high, 2 - 15 meters per second, with a high degree of automation. Wood fingerprints combined with automated inspection makes it possible to tailor subsequent processing steps for each product and can be used to deliver customized products. Wood tracking can also give the machine operators vital feedback on the process parameters.   The motivation for recognition comes from the need for the wood industry to keep track of products without using invasive methods, such as bar code stickers or painted labels. In the project Hol-i-Wood Patching Robot, an automatic scanner- and robot system was developed. In this project, there was a wish to keep track of the <b>shuttering</b> <b>panels</b> that were going to be repaired by the automatic robots.   In this thesis, three different strategies to recognize previously scanned sawn wood products are presented. The first approach uses feature detectors to find matching features between two images. This approach proved to be robust, even when subjected to moderate geometric- and radiometric image distortions. The recognition accuracy reached 100 % when using high quality scans of Scots pine boards that had more than 20 knots.   The second approach uses local knot neighborhood geometry to find point matches between images. The recognition accuracy reached above 99 % when matching simulated Scots pine panels with realistically added noise to the knot positions, given the assumption that 85 % of the knots could be detected. The third approach uses template matching to match a small part of a board against a large set of full-length boards. Cropping and heavy downsampling was implemented in this study. The intensity normalized algorithms using cross-correlation (CC-N) and correlation coefficient (CCF-N) obtained the highest recognition accuracy and had very similar overall performance. For instance, the matching accuracy for the CCF-N method reached above 99 % for query images of length 1 m when the pixel density was above 0. 08 pixels/mm. The last part of this thesis deals with the detection of thin cracks on oak flooring lamellae using ultrasound-excited thermography and machine learning. Today, many people manually grade and detect defects on wooden lamellae in the parquet flooring industry. The last appended paper investigates the possibility to use ensemble methods random forests and boosting to automate the process. When friction occurs in thin cracks they become warm and thus visible for a thermographic camera. Several image processing techniques were used to suppress noise and enhance likely cracks in the images. The best ensemble methods reached an average classification accuracy of 0. 8, which was very close to the authors own manual attempt at separating the images (0. 83) ...|$|R

5000|$|On {{either side}} of Number 37 are Lilla Hoparegränd ("Smaller Heaper's Alley", a {{corruption}} of [...] "Hoper's Alley", e.g. hooper indicating a profession, 'maker of barrels') and Pelikansgränd ("Pelican's Alley"), both forking off from Gaffelgränd ("Fork alley"). While the building is standing on a medieval wall, the façade is from the 18th century, and the portal from the 17th century. The latter was probably cut by Johan Wendelstam, a German sculptor who arrived to Stockholm in 1641 to become the Guild Master within a few years, and also cut one of the portals on Stortorget. The client was apparently Dutch as the inscription on the gable stone reads: Gaet het wel men heeft veel vrinden kert het luck wie kan se vinden ("When luck stands by one {{have a lot of}} friends, but when luck turns where are they then?"). Behind the front door is an entrance hall featuring a richly profiled sandstone column carrying a cross-vault. [...] The façade of Number 24 dates back to 1862, the <b>shutters</b> and wooden <b>panels</b> from that time however replaced by the rough-cast plaster probably in 1945, and the windows enlarged since. [...] The rusticated façade of Number 26 dates back to the enlargement in 1846, {{at the time it was}} however perfectly symmetric, a balance manipulated in 1973 when the enlarged opening and wooden panel of the restaurant entrance was added. The northern door, still featuring some original details, gives a fair impression of what the façade looked like in the 19th century. [...] The façade of Number 28, arguably one of the oldest still existent residential properties in Stockholm, is mostly from 1874 with some details replaced in 1969.|$|R
