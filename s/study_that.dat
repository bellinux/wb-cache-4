5|$|Based on morphology, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman {{determined}} in a 2004 phylogenetic <b>study</b> <b>that</b> Platyrhinoidis and Platyrhina together form the most basal clade {{of the order}} Myliobatiformes, and are thus the sister group to all {{other members of the}} order (encompassing stingrays and their relatives). This finding affirmed that the thornback guitarfish is not closely related to the true guitarfishes of the family Rhinobatidae, a possibility that had long been considered by taxonomists.|$|E

5|$|Hemmings {{conducted}} a <b>study</b> <b>that</b> surveyed 102 progressive heads—broadly defined—of infant, elementary, {{and secondary schools}} about Neill's influence.

The respondents also reported significant influence from Neill on moral and sex education. Contrarily, Neill had little impact on school curriculum and classroom teaching methods. Hemmings received little response from heads of state comprehensive schools.|$|E

50|$|Although {{there has}} been {{substantial}} debate regarding the assessment of OCD, current research has gravitated toward structural and functional neuroimaging. These technological innovations have provided {{a better understanding of}} the neuroanatomical risk factors of OCD.

Although Sedna is listed on NASA's Solar System exploration website, NASA is not known to be considering any type of mission at this time. It was calculated that a flyby mission to Sedna could take 24.48 years using a Jupiter gravity assist, based on launch dates of 6 May 2033 and 23 June 2046. Sedna would be 77.27 or 76.43AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1699, {{other members}} of the Royal Society (of which Newton was a member) accused Leibniz of plagiarism. The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a <b>study</b> <b>that</b> it was Newton who was the true {{discoverer}} and labelled Leibniz a fraud. This study was cast into doubt when it was later found that Newton himself wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} of crises and {{the severity of}} the 1907 panic added to concern about the outsized role of J.P. Morgan which led to renewed impetus toward a national debate on reform. In May 1908, Congress passed the Aldrich–Vreeland Act that established the National Monetary Commission to investigate the panic and to propose legislation to regulate banking. Senator Nelson Aldrich (R–RI), the chairman of the National Monetary Commission, went to Europe for almost two years to <b>study</b> <b>that</b> continent's banking systems.|$|E

Following renewed historic analysis in the late 20th century and a 1998 DNA <b>study</b> <b>that</b> found a match between the Jefferson male line and a descendant of Hemings' last son, Eston Hemings, there is a near-consensus among historians that Jefferson fathered her son Eston Hemings and probably all her children.

5|$|This {{study has}} been criticized on {{multiple}} grounds, particularly regarding the ages. Duncan himself noted that measurement of the northern ages may {{have been affected by}} loss of argon due to low-grade metamorphism, and that there might be bias in respect of stratigraphic position. The latter was demonstrated by a recent <b>study</b> <b>that</b> showed, on the basis of geochemistry, that the Grays River volcanics followed the Siletzia eruptions, and thus are not representative of the initial phase of Siletz magmatism. Recent dating also shows a more monotonic trend of south to north age progression ("younging").|$|E

Category 1 includes studies publishing results from in vitro research. Category 2 includes <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> compare the test results of a diagnostic test of interest versus those of a reference test. Category 3 includes <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> assess the overall effect of the diagnostic test on future health, function, or quality of life. Finally, Category 4 includes <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> report economic analyses. Each category also includes a hierarchy of evidence (based on <b>study</b> design) <b>that</b> can be used for further assessment of internal validity along with other published criteria for testing internal validity and applicability. Clinical application of Cat- 4 should result in greater awareness of the uncertainties in diagnosis that can result in missed diagnosis and overdiagnosis. Rahul Nair, Amanda-Mae Nguee Ai-Mi...|$|R
