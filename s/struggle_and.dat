5|$|Caliph Abu Bakr died in 634. His successor, Umar, was {{determined}} to continue the Caliphate Empire's expansion deeper into Syria. Though previous campaigns led by Khalid were successful, he was replaced by Abu Ubaidah. Having secured southern Palestine, Muslim forces now advanced up the trade route, where Tiberias and Baalbek fell without much <b>struggle,</b> <b>and</b> conquered Emesa early in 636. From thereon, the Muslims continued their conquest across the Levant.|$|E
5|$|I {{have been}} {{increasingly}} perturbed over the blatant {{disparity between the}} major role which Negro women have played and are playing in the crucial grassroots levels of our <b>struggle</b> <b>and</b> the minor role of leadership they have been assigned in the national policy-making decisions. It is indefensible to call a national march on Washington and send out a call which contains the name of not a single woman leader.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the retreat from Winchester, Matilda rebuilt her court at Devizes Castle, a former property of the Bishop of Salisbury that had been confiscated by Stephen. She established her household knights on the surrounding estates, supported by Flemish mercenaries, ruling through the network of local sheriffs and other officials. Many of those that had lost lands in the regions held by the King travelled west to take up patronage from Matilda. Backed by the pragmatic Robert of Gloucester, Matilda was content to engage in a drawn-out <b>struggle,</b> <b>and</b> the war soon entered a stalemate.|$|E

5|$|In these stanzas, Donne {{compares the}} parting of two lovers to a death, {{desiring}} the lovers' parting to be quiet, without <b>struggle,</b> <b>and</b> voluntary {{even though it}} is inevitable. At the same time, he considers the separation of lovers to be equivalent to the soul separating from the body on death. Ramie Targoff argues that this is not because he sees the separation of the lovers as permanent, like death, but that as with death Donne finds the challenge with separation to be ensuring the relationship's continuity in the future.|$|E
5|$|Selfe's {{contempt}} for the liberal arts tradition and the priority he accorded practical skill have certain implications which cannot be commended. These reflected and augmented... one of the less attractive features of the Australian ethos– indifference to higher learning and advanced attainments, an indifference shading into contempt and suspicion... Selfe may have lost a battle but before long, the liberal arts tradition faced still greater defeats. To these, Selfe certainly contributed, and what must be recognised {{is that in the}} vehemence of the <b>struggle,</b> <b>and</b> in the lauding of efficiency over culture, much that was valuable in the liberal arts tradition was lost.|$|E

At the point in the ritual when the prophet Elijah is welcomed to the meal, the guests recited the Emancipation Proclamation.|$|E

5|$|The {{opposing}} armies met at {{the village}} of Albuera. Both sides suffered heavily in the ensuing <b>struggle</b> <b>and</b> the French finally withdrew on 18 May. Beresford's army was too battered and exhausted to pursue, but was able to resume the investment of Badajoz. Despite Soult's failure to relieve the town, the battle had little strategic effect on the war. Just one month later, in June 1811, the Allies were forced to abandon their siege by {{the approach of the}} reconstituted French Armies of Portugal and Andalusia.|$|E
5|$|The song {{has been}} covered by several artists and {{community}} groups. Pete Seeger Released a studio version on his 1956 album American Industrial Ballads and a live {{version of the}} song on his 1964 album Songs of <b>Struggle</b> <b>and</b> Protest, 1930–50. Both versions by Seeger feature him singing and playing the banjo without any additional accompaniment. In the live version, the crowd's clapping and singing along can be heard. Folk bands in the Pittsburgh area, such as the NewLanders, have both recorded and performed Seeger's version of the song.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the eponymous concept album's lyrics {{focus on}} human <b>struggle</b> <b>and</b> self-determination, A Beautiful Lies lyrics are more {{personal}} {{and the music}} introduces screaming vocals. The transformation that resonates throughout the album reflects the personal and artistic changes experienced by the band members {{before and during the}} creation of the record. The album widened the band's sound by combining elements from progressive rock, hard rock and emo. Such alternative rock style has been compared to bands like The Cure, U2 and The Smashing Pumpkins.|$|E

5|$|While the Slaying of Goliath is a {{relatively}} simple composition with the two protagonists centrally placed and the only other figures being dimly seen observers, the Brazen Serpent picture is crowded with figures and separate incidents as the various individuals who have been attacked by snakes <b>struggle</b> <b>and</b> die or turn toward the icon that will save them. This is the most Mannerist of Michelangelo's earlier compositions at the Sistine Chapel, picking up the theme of human distress begun in the Great Flood scene and carrying it forward into the torment of lost souls in the Last Judgement, which was later painted below.|$|E
5|$|While {{the leaders}} of Congress languished in jail, the other parties {{supported}} the war and gained organizational strength. Underground publications flailed at the ruthless suppression of Congress, but it had little control over events. At {{the end of the}} war, the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point Gandhi called off the <b>struggle,</b> <b>and</b> around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the Congress's leadership.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce's {{spiritual journey}} {{is thought to}} have begun at this time. He started to rise early to read the Bible and pray and kept a private journal. He {{underwent}} an evangelical conversion, regretting his past life and resolving to commit his future life and work to the service of God. His conversion changed some of his habits, but not his nature: he remained outwardly cheerful, interested and respectful, tactfully urging others towards his new faith. Inwardly, he underwent an agonising <b>struggle</b> <b>and</b> became relentlessly self-critical, harshly judging his spirituality, use of time, vanity, self-control and relationships with others.|$|E
