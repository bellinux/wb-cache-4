40|$|Background: Transection of the canine cranial {{cruciate}} ligament (CCL) is a well-established osteoarthritis (OA) model. The effect of CCL loss on contact pressure and joint alignment {{has not been}} quantified for stifle loading in standing. The purposes {{of the study were}} to measure femorotibial contact areas and stresses and joint alignment following transection of the CCL in an ex vivo model. We hypothesized that transection of the CCL would lead to abnormal kinematics, as well as alterations in contact mechanics of the femorotibial joint. Methodology/Principal Findings: Eight canine hindlimbs were tested in a servo-hydraulic materials testing machine using a custom made femoral jig. Contact area and pressure measurements, and femorotibial rotations and translations were measured in the normal and the CCL–deficient stifle in both standing and deep flexion angles. We found that at standing angle, transection of the CCL caused cranial translation and internal rotation of the tibia with a concurrent caudal shift of the contact area, an increase in peak pressure and a decrease in contact area. These changes were not noted in deep flexion. At <b>standing,</b> <b>loss</b> of CCL caused a redistribution of the joint pressure, with the caudal region of the compartment being overloaded {{and the rest of the}} joint being underloaded. Conclusion: In the Pond-Nuki model alterations in joint alignment are correlated with shifting of the contact points to infrequently loaded areas of the tibial plateau.

40|$|Abstract: South Africa is {{currently}} experiencing an electricity crisis. This, {{combined with the}} high levels of solar irradiation as well as the power utility’s need to reduce the country’s peak demand through DSM (Demand Side Management), has promoted the installation of solar water heaters (SWHs) in homes across the country. This paper presents three case studies which were M&V’d according to the IPMVP (International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol). The methodology used does not require baseline measurements since the baseline is calculated from continuous measurements of thermal energy delivered by the newly installed SWHs and estimation of <b>standing</b> <b>losses</b> of the replaced electric water heater (EWH). This allows the homeowner {{to go ahead with the}} installation of the SWH without waiting for M&V to establish a baseline for the EWH which is being replaced. This method is preferred by homeowners and the DSM utility alike, since the installation of the SWH is not delayed by M&V. A measurement system including an electric power meter, inlet and outlet water temperature probes, ambient temperature probe, flow meter and GSM modem were developed to measure the service level and performance of the SWH. This measurement system along with a method for modelling the usage of an EWH are crucial to the M&V methodology employed. This paper describes the type of systems investigated, the M&V metering, M&V methodology, and the payback period of each system. The sensitivity of the savings with respect to EWH <b>standing</b> <b>losses</b> is investigated. This case study provides valuable information for those interested in studying or performing M&V on SWHs...|$|R

In South Africa, where hot water is typically provided by electric resistance storage tank water heaters (geysers), water heating energy consumption exceeds cooking, refrigeration, and lighting {{to be the most}} consumptive single electric appliance in the home. A recent analysis for the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) performed by the authors estimated that <b>standing</b> <b>losses</b> from electric geysers contributed over 1, 000 kWh to the annual electricity bill for South African households that used them. In order to reduce this burden, the South African government is currently pursuing a programme of Energy Efficiency Standards and Labelling (EES&L) for electric appliances, including geysers. In addition, Eskom has a history of promoting heat pump water heaters (HPWH) through incentive programs, which can further reduce energy consumption. This paper provides asurvey of international electric storage water heater test procedures and efficiency metrics which can serve as a reference for comparison with proposed geyser standards and ratings in South Africa.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The largest {{percentage}} of sanitary hot water used in South Africa is heated {{by means of}} electrical resistance heaters. This {{is one of the}} major contributing factors to the undesirable high morning and afternoon peaks imposed on the national electricity supply grid. Water heating therefore continues to be of concern to Eskom, currently South Africa's only electrical utility company. New water heating technologies have been developed for large-scale sanitary water heating in the form of the so-called in-line heater (ILH) and stratified in-tank (SIT) configurations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of these newly developed water heating technologies under load shedding conditions. The performance of the ILH and SIT water heating technologies was evaluated via an existing simulation model under load shedding conditions. Furthermore, an extensive empirical investigation was conducted on a number of real-world water heating plants in order to evaluate the actual performance of the ILH-configuration. The results obtained via the empirical investigation were also employed to further verify the existing simulation model. A new model simulating the <b>standing</b> heat <b>losses</b> suffered by water heating systems was developed. The model can be used to simulate the <b>standing</b> heat <b>losses</b> suffered by a typical centralised water heating facility with good accuracy. It was found that the ILH-technology performs excellent under load shedding conditions. The ILH-plants under investigation were able to shed their entire load during peak demand periods while still supplying the occupants with sufficient hot water throughout the day. The SIT-technology proved to be a good alternative where the ILH-technology is not economically viable, realising the maximum load shedding potential in under-utilised water heating systems. It was also found that the implementation of these water heating systems on a national scale would provide the utility with substantial load shedding potential. The facilities at which the systems are installed would also benefit greatly with annual savings potential on electricity cost ranging from 8. 5 % to 24 %. Master...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009 This study {{presents}} an intelligent Hot Water Cylinder (HWC) usage profiling system to provide peak {{demand side management}} and improve HWC efficiency in a typical household. In this research HWCs will {{be referred to as}} geysers. Research was done into various techniques available to improve energy efficiency in South Africa, as well as the different sectors South Africa's electricity supplier, Eskom, has highlighted where improvements in energy efficiency can be made. From this it was decided to refine the scope of the project to the residential sector, and more importantly geyser. A typical geysers operation and power consumption was researched and analysed to determine where efficiency improvements could be made. A system was required that would reduce the amount of energy consumed by the geyser, and provide the consumer with hot water at the same time. Based on the research it was decided to design a profile based geyser controller. The profiling system comprised of a PIC microcontroller, four digital temperature sensors and a time keeper used to determine individually based hot water usage profiles for the home. The profile was based on three parameters, namely the frequency (repetitiveness) of hot water being drawn, the length of the draw period, and the time of day when the water was drawn. Once the profile had reached a 90 % accuracy, the profile implemented itself. Based on the profile, the controller then regulated the temperature of the geyser according to the demand of the household, without manual intervention. If the household's routine were changed, the profile would adapt itself accordingly. The controller is therefore fully intelligent and continues to refine the profile on a day to day basis. By introducing the profile based controller, the monthly average geyser temperature was reduced, reducing the amount of <b>standing</b> <b>losses,</b> which in torn reduced the total amount of energy consumed by the geyser. The profile controller was designed to aid in the reduction of the energy demand of geysers on the power grid. This will benefit both the consumer as well as Eskom, as Eskom will have a reduced power load, and the consumer will have a reduced electricity bill. The results of the experiments are shown, as well as a comparison between calculated versus measured results, to justify the accuracy of the calculations...|$|R
