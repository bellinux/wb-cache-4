40|$|The This paper {{examines}} consumer {{benefits of}} the Finnish <b>Salmonella</b> <b>Control</b> Program (FSCP) by using a contingent valuation survey method. The survey aimed at measuring consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for Finnish <b>salmonella</b> <b>control</b> program. Based on the survey results, consumers are willing to spend an additional 20 - 50 FIM (or roughly 3. 3 - 8. 3 EUROs) per month to finance the current level <b>salmonella</b> <b>control</b> in {{food of animal origin}} in Finland. This transforms to an annual payment of 420 FIM or about 70 EUROs, which in turn can be taken as a measure of benefits from the current <b>salmonella</b> <b>control</b> program. In comparison to the cost of the program, the benefits are relatively large, and FSCP is therefore considered beneficial from the economic viewpoint. According to the analysis, consumers' concern about the salmonella situation in Finland motivates their WTP for the FSCP. Previous encounter(s) with food poisoning did significantly influence the WTP. An Economic Assessment of Effects of the Finnish <b>Salmonella</b> <b>Control</b> Program on Trade Jukka Peltola 1 Abstract. In this paper, indirect costs of the Finnish <b>Salmonella</b> <b>Control</b> Program (FSCP) are evaluated. Traditional welfare analysis is used for analyzing the changes in consumers' and producers' welfare due to the program. FSCP could, by its very structure, act as a technical trade barrier and thus hinder international trade (food imports to Finland). According to a theoretical analysis, potential welfare losses due to decreased trade flows are possible. However, empirical calculations do not lend support to significant trade losses as nearby countries, practicing large scale food exporting, have prices of food stuffs approximately on the same level as Finnish prices. That suggests, that the program does not greatly affect the trade. In case of pork, some potential effects can be found, however, their real significance is questionable, and direct reasons behind cost dissimilarities cannot be exactly determined.

40|$|Abstract Background Costs and {{benefits}} of two <b>Salmonella</b> <b>control</b> policies for broiler production were described and compared. The control options were the Zoonosis Directive 92 / 117 /EC and the more intense strategy, the Finnish <b>Salmonella</b> <b>Control</b> Programme (FSCP). Methods The comparison included the <b>Salmonella</b> <b>control</b> costs in primary and secondary production and the direct and indirect losses due to Salmonella infections in humans in 2000. Results The total annual costs of the FSCP were calculated to be 990 400 EUR (0. 02 €/kg broiler meat). The average control costs in the broiler production chain were seven times higher with the FSCP than with the Zoonosis Directive alone. However, the public health costs were 33 times higher with the Zoonosis Directive alone. The value of one prevented loss of life per year exceeded the annual control costs of the FSCP.

Major {{reductions in the}} incidence of foodborne human salmonellosis have occurred by integrated control of farms and food processing plants.

In 2001, the Danish society saved U. S. $ 25. 5 million by <b>controlling</b> <b>Salmonella.</b> The total annual <b>Salmonella</b> <b>control</b> costs in year 2001 were U. S. $ 14. 1 million (U.

Consumption of pork products {{is believed to be}} a major source of human salmonellosis and <b>Salmonella</b> <b>control</b> throughout the food-chain is recommended. A number of on-farm interventions have been proposed, and some have been implemented {{in order to try to}} achieve <b>Salmonella</b> <b>control.</b> In this study we utilize previously developed models describing Salmonella dynamics to investigate the potential effects of a range of these on-farm interventions. As the models indicated that the number of bacteria shed in the faeces of an infectious animal was a key factor, interventions applied within a high-shedding scenario were also analysed. From simulation of the model, the probability of infection after Salmonella exposure was found to be a key driver of Salmonella transmission. The model also highlighted that minimising physiological stress can have a large effect but only when shedding levels are not excessive. When shedding was high, weekly cleaning and disinfection was not effective in <b>Salmonella</b> <b>control.</b> However it is possible that cleaning may have an effect if conducted more often.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence and infection status of Salmonella species (spp.) in 25 conventional pig farms by traditional fecal culture and serological methods to develop a <b>Salmonella</b> <b>control</b> program for Korean pig farms. The individual seroprevalence of Salmonella spp. in pigs reared in the 25 pig farms was 83. 1 % in sows and 6. 4 - 32 % in different aged pig groups, with the total seroprevalence 28. 4 % (141 / 848). The seroprevalence of the tested pigs increased in accord-ance with the decrease in maternal antibody and the rearing period on these farms. Of note, all the 25 pig farms contained at least two or more anti-Salmonella antibody-positive sows. In the fecal cul-tures Salmonella spp. were isolated only in three (12. 0 %, 3 / 25) of 16 serologically Salmonella-suspected farms (64. 0 %, 16 / 25), showing the limitation of the fecal culture method and the need for serum as-says to understand the exact status of Salmonella infection in swine herds, which likely contain sub-clinically infected pigs or carriers. The results highlight the need to establish a supply system of Salmonella-free gilts for the promotion of a national <b>Salmonella</b> <b>control</b> program on swine farms in Korea.

40|$|The goal of {{this risk}} {{assessment}} was to describe {{and as far as}} possible quantify the risk of salmonella to consumers from pork and pork products sold in Finland.

The programme covers cattle, pigs and poultry. Based on this <b>salmonella</b> <b>control</b> program, Finland has also been granted so-called additional guarantees, which allow her to require that certain imported foods be examined in the country of origin for salmonella, with exceptions granted to countries which have a similar <b>salmonella</b> <b>control</b> program.

The assessment covered the entire production process from slaughter to consumer, and was done with the help of four quantitative submodels. For the purposes of this study, pork products were divided into three groups: products comparable to fresh meat, products which are not heated to 70 °C, and products whose preparation includes heating to 70 °C, or the equivalent.

40|$|This study {{presents}} British farmers’ perception of, {{and barriers}} to, implementing <b>Salmonella</b> <b>control</b> on pig farms. Four farms that had implemented interventions and their 33 close contacts (known {{to the intervention}} farmers) took part in interviews before (phase 1) and after (phase 2) intervention trials to assess the difference in perception over time. Their results were compared against those from nine randomly selected control farms. The hypothesis was that farms implementing interventions whether or not successful, would influence their close contacts’ opinion over time. Based on a ‘pathway to disease control’ model, three intrinsic factors known to influence motivation – attitudes, social norms and self-efficacy – were evaluated. Farmers mentioned that successful interventions on a farm would attract their attention. The use of an appropriate communication strategy is therefore recommended to stimulate farmers’ intent to implement control measures. Both {{before and after the}} intervention trials, all farmers had a positive attitude towards <b>Salmonella</b> <b>control</b> and felt that their peers and authorities were supportive of <b>controlling</b> <b>Salmonella</b> on farms. In phase 2, however, farmers were more likely to want to share the burden of control with other stakeholders along the food chain and their belief in self-efficacy had weakened. Whilst social norms were not associated with an intention to take action on control, a positive attitude towards <b>Salmonella</b> <b>control</b> and a belief in self-efficacy were more likely to result in an intent to control. In phase 2, farmers with an intent to implement an intervention appeared to have a greater, but not significant positive belief in self-efficacy (p = 0. 108). This study confirmed that farmers recognised their responsibility for <b>controlling</b> <b>Salmonella</b> in pork – even though their {{confidence in their ability to}} <b>control</b> <b>Salmonella</b> decreased over time – and believed that responsibility should be shared with the rest of the production chain. It showed that farmers trusted their veterinarian as a source of advice to guide them during the process of implementing change, though an increase in farms’ Salmonella seroprevalence score (Zoonosis National Control Programme (ZNCP) score) especially for those with a low ZNCP score was also likely to influence their behaviour. Getting concrete feedback from customers or a tangible benefit from their action was a strong incentive especially for farms with a ZNCP score higher than 50 %.
