6000|$|As it {{took the}} next step, and {{appeared}} about to <b>spring,</b> <b>Jack</b> pulled the trigger. The cap alone exploded! Like {{a flash of light}} the other trigger was pulled; it also failed! some moisture must have got into the nipples in loading. Almost as quick as thought Jack hurled his piece at the brute with a force that seemed to me irresistible. The butt struck it full in the chest, but the rifle was instantly caught in its iron gripe. At that moment Peterkin fired, and the gorilla dropped like a stone, uttering a heavy groan as it fell prone with its face to the earth--not, however, before it had broken Jack's rifle across, and twisted the barrel {{as if it had been}} merely a piece of wire! ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>Jack</b> (1885), brown colt sired by Springfield. <b>Spring</b> <b>Jack</b> won a few races, {{such as the}} Houghton New Nursery Stakes, in Britain {{before he}} was {{exported}} to South America in 1889. He was owned by the Traill family in Argentina and was an important sire in establishing bloodlines of Argentine polo ponies.|$|E
50|$|Dutch Oven {{was sold}} to Lord Fitzwilliam for Â£3200 at the {{dispersal}} of Lord Falmouth's stud {{in the spring of}} 1884. She died in March 1894 after producing the colt Simmer to the cover of St. Simon. At the time of her death, she was considered a failure as a broodmare as her produce were not good racers. Her sons <b>Spring</b> <b>Jack,</b> Gridiron and Simmer did achieve success in the stud in Argentina and Australia.|$|E

50|$|The effigy, made {{of straw}} or stuffed clothes, was abused and stoned on Ash Wednesday while being dragged about the parish. The figure was kept until Palm Sunday, {{when it was}} burnt. Its burning was often {{believed}} to be a symbolic revenge on Judas Iscariot, who had betrayed Christ. It is equally likely that the figure represented the hated winter and its destruction prepares the way for <b>spring.</b> <b>Jack</b> o' Lent is mentioned in Thomas Heywood's The Four Prentices of London, Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor, Anthony Burgess' Nothing Like the Sun, Henry Fielding's Joseph Andrews {{as well as in the}} 1640s pamphlet, The Arraignment Conviction and Imprisonment of Christmas.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, {{with only}} one hour left {{before the arrival of}} <b>spring,</b> <b>Jack</b> returns to human form to stop Kraus by tricking his Keh-Nights into walking off the icy {{mountain}} to their destruction by imitating Dummy. Afterwards, Jack causes Kubla to fall out of his castle and Father Winter literally blows Kubla far away from Miserable Mountain leaving Jack to claim the gold for himself, tames Klangstumper, making him his horse, and the castle becomes his house. He races off to ask Elisa's parents for her hand in marriage, but during his absence, she has fallen in love with Sir Ravenal, and he with her. Jack becomes a sprite again for good, and blows ice onto Elisa's wedding bouquet, turning it white. When asked about the change, she sheds a tear, saying [...] "An old friend just kissed the bride." [...] Snip calls out to Jack that winter wouldn't be the same without him.|$|E
