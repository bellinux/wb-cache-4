50|$|<b>Suloctidil</b> was a sulfer-containing aminoalcohol {{that was}} brought to market in the early 1970s as a {{vasodilator}} by Continental Pharma, a Belgian company.|$|E
5000|$|Continental {{was bought}} by Monsanto in 1984, {{primarily}} {{on the promise of}} sales of <b>suloctidil,</b> which was approved in Europe at the time, but not in the US. [...] However, in 1985 Monsanto halted development and withdrew the drug worldwide following reports of liver toxicity.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Four {{hundred and}} thirty-eight {{patients}} who had suffered a thromboembolic stroke not {{less than two weeks}} or more than four months previously, were entered into a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial to determine whether <b>suloctidil</b> (200 mg t. i. d.) would influence the subsequent recurrence of stroke, the occurrence of myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death. The two treatment groups were comparable at baseline with respect to important prognostic variables and there was good adherence to the study protocol during an average follow-up of 20 months. Significantly more patients complained of side-effects in the <b>suloctidil</b> group and more hepatotoxicity was also reported in the <b>suloctidil</b> group. Four cases of clinical hepatitis were suspected to be due to <b>suloctidil,</b> each of which was reversible on termination of study treatment; relative increases in SGOT and SGPT at three months in the <b>suloctidil</b> group were found to be mild and transient. The primary analysis of efficacy was based on the incidence of the first event of stroke, myocardial infarction or cardiovascualr death, but excluding events that occurred more than 28 days after complete withdrawal from study medication for whatever reason. Thus, the primary analysis included 38 events in the <b>suloctidil</b> group and 47 in the placebo group (p = 0. 17) representing a risk reduction of 24 %. If total mortality is substituted for cardiovascular death, the corresponding figures are 47 in the <b>suloctidil</b> grou...|$|E
40|$|<b>Suloctidil</b> is a calcium {{antagonist}} with vascular relaxing activity and an antithrombotic agent: its antiplatelet {{action has been}} demonstrated in vivo, but is difficult to reproduce in vitro and the mechanism of this effect remains unknown. We have observed that <b>suloctidil</b> (10 microM) stimulated the release of prostacyclin (PGI 2) from the rabbit aorta, the dog vena cava and the dog portal vein, in vitro. This effect {{could be explained by}} an increased mobilization of free arachidonic acid. Neither the inactive congener CP 894 S, nor the two calcium channel antagonists, verapamil and flunarizine, reproduced the stimulatory effect of <b>suloctidil.</b> <b>Suloctidil</b> acted selectively on the vascular endothelium: it stimulated the release of PGI 2 from bovine aortic and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, but neither from the de-endothelialized rabbit aorta nor from the bovine aortic media. The stimulatory effect of <b>suloctidil</b> on the release of the platelet inhibitor PGI 2 from the vascular endothelium might contribute to the known antiplatelet and antithrombotic activity of this drug.

40|$|Summary: Human foetal lung {{fibroblasts}} were pretreated for 24 h {{with the}} antithrombotic drug, <b>suloctidil</b> (1 to 10 μπιο 1 / 1), which induced a dose-dependent increase in LDL binding, uptake and degradation. At 10 μηαοΐ/ΐ <b>suloctidil,</b> the respective increases in these parameters were 40 %, 80 % and 50 %. The same treatment {{also resulted in}} increases of 1. 5 to 2 -fold in the synthesis of sterols, fatty acids and triacylglycerols from sodium acetate. In contrast, the esterification of cholesterol with oleic acid was specifically decreased by 35 % by 24 h pretreatment of fibroblasts with 10 μπιοΙ/ 1 <b>suloctidil.</b> A similar decrease of cholesterol esterification was observed in cholesterol-laden fibroblasts. It is suggested that these effects of <b>suloctidil</b> on LDL processing and cholesterol metabolism {{are related to the}} amphiphilic characteristics of the drug and to its calcium-blocking properties...|$|E
40|$|A "cavity" lesion made by {{aspiration}} in the rat occipital cortex induces a parenchymal and a vascular {{reaction in}} its vicinity. The first was mainly characterized by cellular necrosis and gliosis, the second {{by an increase}} of the vascular network. In vehicle treated rats, a 50 % significant increase of the vascular network was observed around the cavity 4 days after the lesion, {{in comparison to the}} uninjured contralateral cortex. The effects of a vasoactive substance, <b>suloctidil,</b> on the vascular reaction was studied in the brain cortex. A single oral dose of <b>suloctidil</b> (30 mg/kg; 2 hours before the sacrifice) gave the same effect as the vehicle group. After 8 days of <b>suloctidil</b> oral administration (30 mg/kg; twice daily: 4 days before lesion and 4 days after) a significant increase (123 %) of the vascular network was observed around the cavity. The hypothetical ways by which a chronic treatment of <b>suloctidil</b> induces this increase of the neovascularization observed after cortical lesion are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Interaction between <b>suloctidil</b> (CP 556 S) and lipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine) is studied {{using a new}} {{conformational}} analysis procedure. This analysis is extended to two compounds related to <b>suloctidil</b> but bearing no protonable group (CP 894 S) or of different hydrophobicity (CP 1136 S). It gives a molecular description of the mode of insertion of the drugs into the lipid layer. The influence of the calculated lipid-drug interaction and area occupied per drug molecule in the lipid layer is tentatively related to {{the effect on the}} lipid dynamics. For a given conformer, an effect on the lipid dynamics is expected only if (a) the area occupied per conformer {{is similar to that of}} the lipid and/or (b) the drug-lipid interaction energy is equal or superior to that of the lipid-lipid interaction. These predictions are analyzed in terms of the available experimental data. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The topical superfusion of ASA and {{indomethacin}} {{results in}} a marked decrease of thrombus formation, while tranylcypromine enhances the thrombotic phenomenon. The intravenous injection of <b>suloctidil</b> {{results in a}} marked decrease of the enhancing effect of tranylcypromine. It can be concluded from these experiments that the prostaglandin biochemical pathways very likely {{play an important role}} in the patelet-vessel wall interactions leading to local thrombosis and ultimately to atherogenesis.

40|$|Forty-five {{patients}} with intermittent claudication were first treated with placebo tablets for 3 {{months and then}} randomly allocated to double-blind therapy with either <b>suloctidil</b> or placebo for 6 months. Walking distance improved significantly in both groups during the 3 months of placebo treatment. During the 6 months of double-blind treatment with a further significant improvement occurred only {{in the placebo group}} when all patients were analyzed. However, when patients who stopped for reasons unrelated to claudication such as angina and exhaustion during repeated walking tests were eliminated, only suloctidil-treated patients improved significantly. The evolution of leg flow and distal pressure was similar in the two treatment groups whether all legs or only legs with abnormal flow and pressure values were considered. By contrast, when the analysis was limited to legs with claudication pain, a significant improvement occurred only in the suloctidil-treated group. These findings suggest that <b>suloctidil</b> may improve the claudication symptoms of {{patients with}} chronic arterial obstructive disease and in particular the perfusion of legs experiencing claudication pain. However, the clinical significance of this improvement appears limited. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Verapamil, <b>suloctidil</b> {{and other}} organic calcium-antagonists inhibit {{translocation}} from an aqueous medium into a hydrophobic domain mediated by 8 -[1 -(ethyl- 1 -carboxy-pyrrole- 2) ]- 4 -(2 -methylene- 4 -carboxy- 5 -methylamino-ben zoxazole) -spiro(5, 5) hendecan- 3, 9, 11 -trimethyl- 6, 7 -dioxane (A 23187). The {{magnitude of this}} inhibition depends on the verapamil/ionophore concentration ratio, {{the slope of the}} dose-action relationship (in semilogarithmic coordinates) being comparable with distinct drugs of vastly different biological potency. Like in intact cells, calcium itself protects against the inhibitory effect of the calcium-antagonists, an effect which apparently depends on a direct interaction with the calcium-binding site of the ionophoretic molecule. Verapamil also inhibits calcium and sodium translocation mediated by 3 -methyl- 5 -bromo- 6 -{ 7 -ethyl- 4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -dimethyl- 6 -oxo- 7 -[5 -ethyl- 3 -methyl - 5 -(5 -ethyl- 5 -hydroxy- 6 -methyl- 2 -tetrahydropyranyl) - 2 -tetrahydrofuryl]heptyl }salicylic acid (X 537 A). The relative efficiency of <b>suloctidil</b> and its analogues or metabolites to inhibit calcium translocation correlates with their potency to inhibit smooth muscle contraction. These findings suggest that the interference of organic calcium-antagonists with native ionophoretic processes represents a fundamental event in the expression of their biological action.

40|$|The {{action of}} {{dipyridamole}} on the vascular production of prostacyclin (PGI 2) has been investigated. Dipyridamole (1 - 100 microM) did not induce a significant stimulation of PGI 2 release {{in any of}} the following experimental models: rings of rabbit aorta, cultured endothelial cells from bovine aorta or human umbilical vein, cultured explants of bovine aortic smooth muscle. The activity of known stimuli of PGI 2 release (ADP, <b>suloctidil,</b> serotonin) and the capacity of dipyridamole to inhibit adenosine uptake into endothelial cells were carefully checked. Pretreatment of the rabbit aorta with dipyridamole (10 - 100 microM) prolonged the transient stimulation of PGI 2 release induced by mechanical deendothelialization: this effect was probably due to a partial protection of the cyclooxygenase against oxidative self-inactivation. Our largely negative results are consistent with the current theory that the antiplatelet action of dipyridamole is mediated by adenosine and not by PGI 2. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|The stimulus-secretion {{coupling}} of 2 -keto acid-induced insulin {{release was}} investigated using 2 -ketoisocaproate (4 -methyl- 2 -oxopentanoate) {{as the principal}} model secretagogue. 2 -Ketoisocaproate and 2 -ketocaproate (2 -oxo-, hexanoate) provoked changes in B cell electrical behavior characterized by an initial depolarization of the membrane potential, followed by rapid spike activity, which appeared either in a bursting pattern or as continuous activity. The onset of spike activity induced by 2 -ketoisocaproate (5 mM) was biphasic in nature. The dynamic pattern of 2 -ketoisocaproate-induced insulin release was also biphasic. 2 -[U- 14 C]Ketoisocaproate (10 mM) was oxidized in islet tissue at a rate equivalent to that of [U- 14 C]glucose (17 mM) and a t {{a higher rate than}} 2 -ketoisovalerate (3 -methyl- 2 -oxobutyrate) and 2 -keto- 3 -methyl-valerate, which were poor secretagogues. Like glucose, 2 -ketoisocaproate provoked characteristic changes in 86 Rb and 45 Ca efflux from prelabeled islets and stimulated 45 Ca net uptake. Proinsulin synthesis was stimulated by 2 -ketoisocaproate through both a general effect on protein synthesis and a specific effect on hormonal biosynthesis. 2 -Ketoisocaproate and 2 -ketocaproate reproduced the effect of glucose on the islet content of ATP, ADP, AMP, NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH. These findings together with a series of observations on the effects upon the above parameters of site-specific inhibitors, e. g. respiratory inhibitors, <b>suloctidil,</b> theophylline, and epinephrine, suggested that the stimulus-secretion-coupling mechanisms for 2 -ketoisocaproate- and glucose-induced release are similar. It is postulated that glucose- and 2 -keto acid-induced insulin release may be initiated by a common signal. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
