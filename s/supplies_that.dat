The storm delayed shipment of emergency food supplies to a boarding school on a remote island in Micronesia.|$|E
5|$|With {{medical and}} other non combat units, the force totalled around 2,000 men. Intelligence {{gathered}} supported {{the theory that}} Dinar was going to invade Sudan, so in March 1916 Wingate ordered Kelly {{to cross the border}} and occupy Jebel el Hella and Um Shanga. The two villages offered the only permanent water <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> were on the road to El Fasher, Dinar's capital.|$|E
5|$|American {{businessman}} and philanthropist Armand Hammer, {{well known to}} the Soviet Union for his financial pursuits and humanitarian ties, left Los Angeles for Armenia on board a Boeing 727 loaded with 2,300 pounds of medical <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> were provided by the American Red Cross. Hammer, known for his decades of work with the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, had spoken with Gorbachev prior to leaving and was carrying with him $1 million in relief funds. Half of those funds were from World Vision International, a California-based relief and development umbrella organization, {{and the other half}} were his own personal donation.

5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints who {{remained}} in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford {{the costs of the}} wagon, teams of oxen, and <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> would be required for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund, to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.|$|E
5|$|James Livingston had {{advanced}} to Montgomery {{the idea of}} taking Fort Chambly, near where his militia was encamped. One of Livingston's captains, Jeremy Duggan, had, on September 13, floated two nine-pound guns past St. Jean, and these guns were put to use to that end. Chambly, which was garrisoned by only 82 men, mostly from the 7th Foot, was surrendered on October 18 by its commander, Major Joseph Stopford, after two days of bombardment. Most seriously, Stopford failed to destroy <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> were vitally useful to the Americans, primarily gunpowder, but also winter provisions. Six tons of powder, 6,500 musket cartridges, 125 muskets, 80 barrels of flour and 272 barrels of foodstuff were captured.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Washington's {{orders were}} delivered, a British raiding party under George Collier and Edward Mathew arrived in Virginia to capture or destroy <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> might {{otherwise}} be sent southward to aid the reinforcements going to South Carolina. Scott's orders changed again; the Virginia House of Delegates ordered him to immediately prepare defenses against Collier and Mathew's raids. When {{it became clear to}} both the legislature and Washington that Collier and Mathew intended only to raid supplies, not to invade, they concluded that the local militia would be able to sufficiently protect Virginia's interests and that Scott should continue to recruit men to reinforce the south. The legislators presented him with a horse, a firearm, and 500 pounds sterling for his quick response to the threat.|$|E

Efforts were organized in Ibagué and Bogotá for Armero and in Cali for Chinchina, where medical teams gathered. Makeshift triage stations were established in Lerida, Guayabal, and Mariquita, and soon were overwhelmed with the sheer number of victims. The remaining victims were directed to Ibagué's hospitals, as local institutions had already been destroyed or were at risk from further lahars.|$|E
5|$|Two federal cavalry {{divisions}} {{encountered the}} remnants of General Early's army at Waynesboro, Virginia, on March 2. Most of Early's army was killed or captured, although Early evaded capture. Custer's division did the fighting. His 1st Brigade dismounted and attacked as infantry, then the 3rd Brigade charged and cut off over half of Early's force—which forced {{that portion of the}} rebels to surrender. All of Early's headquarters equipment was captured, as were 11 pieces of artillery. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry captured 200 wagons loaded with <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> were supposed to be sent to Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Early's army was eliminated from the war.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1944, the Australian Government {{agreed to}} take on {{responsibility}} for the military operations in the northern Solomon Islands and Australian New Guinea, including New Britain. The Australian Army's 5th Division, under Major General Alan Ramsay, was selected to replace the 40th Infantry Division on New Britain in August, with the unit to assume responsibility for the island on 1 November. Instead of maintaining the American bases in western New Britain the Australians planned to operate closer to the Japanese forces which were positioned around the Gazelle Peninsula in the north-east of the island. By {{the time of the}} Australian take-over, Allied intelligence estimated that the Japanese forces on New Britain amounted to 38,000 personnel, but in actuality there were 93,000 Japanese on the island, forming part of General Hitoshi Imamura's Eighth Area Army. The Japanese personnel were focused upon sustaining themselves, with rice-growing and gardening being undertaken to supplement the limited <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> were arriving. Japanese supporting elements were limited, with only two aircraft capable of action and no ships other than 150 barges that could move up to 90 personnel or 15 tons of stores.|$|E

5|$|In {{the event}} of invasion, the Royal Navy would have sailed to the landing places, {{possibly}} taking several days. It is now known that the Germans planned {{to land on the}} southern coast of England; one reason for this site was that the narrow seas of the English Channel could be blocked with mines, submarines and torpedo boats. While German naval forces and the Luftwaffe could have extracted a high price from the Royal Navy, they could not have hoped to prevent interference with attempts to land a second wave of troops and <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> would have been essential to German success—even if, by then, the Germans had captured a port essential for bringing in significant heavy equipment. In this scenario, British land forces would have faced the Germans on more equal terms than otherwise and it was only necessary to delay the German advance, preventing a collapse until the German land forces were, at least temporarily, isolated by the Royal Navy and then mounting a counterattack.|$|E
5|$|Irataba {{guided the}} party into the Mohave Canyon, {{indicating}} {{the location of}} rapids and advising the Explorer pilot of convenient places to anchor while camping for the night. When they reached {{the entrance to the}} Black Canyon of the Colorado, the ship crashed against a submerged rock, throwing several men overboard, dislodging the boiler, and damaging the wheelhouse. Using their skiff, the crew towed the Explorer to the shore, where they camped for three days while repairing the vessel. The expedition had relied on beans and corn provided by the Mohave during the previous weeks; as their supplies dwindled they grew increasingly anxious about the arrival of a resupply pack train from Fort Yuma. Irataba volunteered to hike towards the Mohave Valley to try to locate the <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> had been requested several days earlier. He also warned that the expedition was being watched by Paiutes.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September, {{the same}} day the railway group returned, the brigade set out at 06:00 for Amman. Approaching from the north, they would be {{supported}} during the assault by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. At 10:30 the regiment, with a machine-gun section and an artillery section, was ordered to move forward {{to the left of the}} Canterbury Mounted Rifles. The Turkish defenders were in redoubts surrounded by barbed wire. McCarroll sent a squadron to attack from the west, which came under Turkish machine-gun fire. Covered by the artillery the squadron was gradually able to advance. At 15:30 the reserve squadron galloped forward, dismounted and came under machine-gun fire. The regiment and Canterbury Mounted Rifles pushed forward. The 4th Squadron succeeded in reaching a double redoubt, but just as they were about to charge, sixty of the defenders surrendered and others withdrew along the Wadi Amman. By now the Canterbury Mounted Rifles had galloped into the town and out the other side, capturing the Turkish defences there from the rear. The battle was over and the brigade captured 1,734 prisoners, twenty-seven machine-guns, five artillery pieces, 298 horses and other military <b>supplies.</b> <b>That</b> night the regiment camped in the Wadi Amman.|$|E

5|$|Since 1966, over 630,000 men, 100,000 tons of foodstuffs, 400,000 weapons, and 50,000 tons of {{ammunition}} had traveled {{through the maze}} of gravel and dirt roads, paths, and river transportation systems that crisscrossed southeastern Laos. The trail also linked up with a similar logistical system in neighboring Cambodia known as the Sihanouk Trail. However, following the overthrow of Prince Norodom Sihanouk in 1970, the pro-American Lon Nol regime had denied the use of the port of Sihanoukville to communist shipping. Strategically, this was an enormous blow to the North Vietnamese effort, since 70 percent of all military <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> supported its effort in the far south had moved through the port. A further blow to the logistical system in Cambodia had come {{in the spring and summer}} of 1970, when U.S. and ARVN forces had crossed the border and attacked PAVN/NLF Base Areas during the Cambodian Campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} attention of both flood and fire reached Joan Kroc, the McDonald's heiress, who anonymously (her anonymity was later {{revealed to the}} public by the Grand Forks Herald) donated $15,000,000 to be divided into $2,000 portions for each damaged household (though the amount some homeowners received was less due to the huge number of devastated homes; in all 7,500 households received funds). Additionally, another single anonymous donor gave $5 million which was distributed in $1,000 allotments. In November 1997, North Dakota Governor Ed Schafer reported that victims had been assisted by 50,000 relief agency volunteers who had served more than 2 million meals. Additionally, the communities received clothing and <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> were donated from every U.S. state. During a concert in Fargo, the rock group KISS donated the money from sales of a special T-shirt to the Fargo and Grand Forks areas to assist in flood relief.|$|E
5|$|With {{effect from}} June 12, {{a state of}} public {{emergency}} was declared {{for the whole of}} Tuvalu, by the then Governor-General of Tuvalu, Sir Tulaga Manuella. This was because there was only a limited amount of food available on Funafuti to cater for the whole of the island nation, while providing Niulakita with immediate relief supplies. This enabled the Tuvaluan embassy in Suva, Fiji to appeal to various overseas countries and organisations including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United Nations Development Programme to provide aid and assistance to the island nation. During June 14, the Royal New Zealand Air Force deployed a transport plane carrying some relief materials including tarpaulins and water from New Zealand. The plane subsequently stopped in Noumea, New Caledonia and Nadi, Fiji to pick up further relief <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> had been donated by Australia, Fiji and France. The crew of the plane subsequently conducted an aerial assessment of the damage on Niulakita, and reported seeing widespread damage, before they arrived at Funafuti Airport during June 15.|$|E

5|$|On Malta, the {{dissolution}} of the Roman Catholic Church under French rule had been extremely unpopular among the native Maltese population. During an auction of church property on 2 September 1798, an armed uprising had begun that had forced the French garrison, commanded by General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois, to retreat into the capital Valletta {{by the end of the}} month. The garrison, which numbered approximately 3,000 men, had limited food stocks, and efforts to bring supplies in by sea were restricted by a squadron of British and Portuguese ships stationed off the harbour. The blockade was under the command of Nelson, now Lord Nelson, based in Palermo on Sicily, and directly managed by Captain Alexander Ball on the ship of the line HMS Alexander. During 1799 a number of factors, including inadequate food production on Malta, lack of resources and troops caused by commitments elsewhere in the Mediterranean and the appearance of a French fleet under Admiral Etienne Eustache Bruix in the Western Mediterranean all contributed to lapses in the blockade. However, despite the trickle of <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> reached the garrison, Vaubois' troops were beginning to suffer the effects of starvation and disease. Late in the year Ball went ashore assist the Maltese troops conducting the siege and was replaced in command of Alexander by his first lieutenant, William Harrington.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{government}} identified basic <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> {{it needed}} {{in response to}} the storm; those included various foods, clothing, medicine, shelter supplies, and sanitation equipment. The country made a formal request for international assistance, noting that the storm was the worst in 100years, and officials had limited resources due to the unexpected destruction. Prior to the request, the government of Switzerland sent about 500,000 Swiss francs ($360,000 USD) for immediate relief assistance. Subsequently, ten other countries sent cash or relief supplies worth $2.6 million, including medical shelters from the United States, clothing from the United Kingdom, tents from Russia, and transport goods from Japan. Red Cross workers had to travel by riverboat to bring aid to the most affected communities, due to the poor state of the roads. After two months, the Red Cross distributed 65,401 roofing sheets, 390 metric tons of rice, 11,990 mosquito nets, 6,871 blankets, 3,664 medical kits, and abundant clothing supplies to about 150,000 affected people; the supplies were purchased in Ho Chi Minh City. Eventually, the food supply and health status of the storm victims proved not as bad as originally feared. After the assistance was distributed, the Red Cross shifted focus toward reconstruction. Reconstruction was slow, partly due to a slowdown in economic activity from the Vietnamese New Year. Additionally, the two primary factories responsible for making iron and construction frames were only intermittently open, due to machines failing.|$|E
5|$|The party aboard Alceste, having {{determined}} that the ship was in no immediate danger of sinking, decided to remain aboard overnight. However, at dawn they awoke to discover the ship surrounded by Dayak (or Malay) proas armed with swivel guns. The party escaped on the raft, only reaching the island ahead of the pursuing proas {{with the assistance of}} boats sent to meet them carrying armed Royal Marines. With the wreck vacated, the Dayaks began enthusiastically looting it and several proas approached the island, landing their crews on offshore rocks to both observe the British and store their salvage. Maxwell hastily organised defensive positions in case the Dayaks attacked the island, completing the stockade on the island's hill and preparing sharpened stakes and hundreds of improvised cartridges for the group's 30 muskets. Over the next few days the proas approached the island several times, but despite attempts by the British to communicate with them, never landed. Eventually, on 22 February, Maxwell took advantage of the divided Dayak positions to drive their observers off the rocks, with the intention of recapturing the wreck. This was initially successful, but the departing Dayaks set fire to Alceste, burning her to the waterline. The destruction of the frigate's upper works exposed her hold, and the next morning the stranded sailors were able to collect some <b>supplies</b> <b>that</b> had floated out.|$|E
