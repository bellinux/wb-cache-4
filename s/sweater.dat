5|$|The {{story was}} later made into an {{animated}} short, The <b>Sweater,</b> narrated by Carrier.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} based on a real {{experience}} Carrier had as a child in Sainte-Justine, Quebec in 1946 as a fan of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team and its star player, Maurice Richard. Carrier and his friends all wear Canadiens' sweaters with Richard's number 9 on the back. When his mother orders a new <b>sweater</b> from the department store in the big city after the old one has worn out, he is mistakenly sent a <b>sweater</b> of Montreal's bitter rival, the Toronto Maple Leafs, instead. Carrier faces the persecution of his peers and his coach prevents him from playing.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{architecture}} of the European countries at the Mediterranean Sea, the 1979 planning report for the park suggested it would be home to a shirt and <b>sweater</b> store with the option for screen printed customization, a shop of hats featuring Hanna Barbera characters, a magic and novelty shop, and a store of Mediterranean decorative gifts and jewellery.|$|E
5000|$|Cowichan <b>sweaters</b> {{are also}} called Siwash <b>Sweaters,</b> Indian <b>Sweaters,</b> Curling <b>Sweaters</b> or {{sometimes}} Mary Maxim <b>Sweaters.</b> While [...] "Cowichan" [...] {{is the name}} of a specific First Nations group, the word “siwash” is borrowed from Chinook jargon, the historic trade language of the Pacific Northwest. It is derived from sauvage (wild) and is felt by some to contain derisive connotations.|$|R
50|$|The All-Stars wore red <b>sweaters</b> {{with white}} stripes and white stars across the chest above the NHL shield. The referees wore dark blue <b>sweaters.</b> The Leafs wore their white <b>sweaters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thin <b>sweaters</b> may be worn {{tucked into}} the {{waistband}} of trousers; but otherwise, men's <b>sweaters</b> are worn untucked. Nonetheless, some individuals, including some television and film actors, have been known for wearing tucked-in <b>sweaters.</b>|$|R
5|$|Beginning with Tandy in 1948 and {{continuing}} {{into the early}} 1950s, Nancy's appearance was updated to follow the current styles. In postwar opulence, a trend emerged for young adults {{to have their own}} casual style, instead of dressing in the same styles as more mature adults, and Nancy becomes less constrained. <b>Sweater</b> or blouse and skirt ensembles, as well as a pageboy hairstyle, were introduced in 1948, and continued with new artist Bill Gillies, who updated 10 covers and illustrated three new jackets from 1950 to 1952. Gillies used his wife for a model, and Nancy reflects the conservative 1950s, with immaculately waved hair and a limited wardrobe– she wears similar <b>sweater,</b> blouse, and skirt ensembles, in different combinations, on most of these covers. Gillies also designed the modern-era trademark as a spine symbol which was used for decades: Nancy's head in profile, looking through a quizzing glass.|$|E
5|$|Boys may wear a dark grey {{or black}} suit, plain black, grey or navy V-neck <b>sweater</b> and a scarf of a plain colour. Girls may wear plain {{tailored}} suits (skirt or trousers) in black, navy or dark grey. Shirts may be plain grey, blue or white. There is a sixth form house tie available, although girls {{may choose to}} wear a pin badge instead.|$|E
5|$|Cammalleri {{signed a}} five-year, $25 million {{contract}} {{as a free}} agent with the New Jersey Devils on July 1, 2014. In his first season for the Devils, he was the teams leading scorer with 27 goals. For the 2015–16 season Cammalleri became the first player {{in the history of the}} Devils to wear <b>sweater</b> #13, becoming the first player to wear it since Robin Burns wore it with the Kansas City Scouts. He scored his sixth career hat-trick on November 6, 2016, against the Carolina Hurricanes.|$|E
50|$|Home uniform <b>sweaters</b> are {{predominantly}} black in colour. Away uniform <b>sweaters</b> {{are predominantly}} white.|$|R
5000|$|Penguin <b>sweaters,</b> {{also known}} as penguin jumpers, are <b>sweaters</b> knitted for {{penguins}} that have been caught in oil slicks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{two teams}} wore vintage-style uniforms, using the current Reebok Edge {{equipment}} and material. The Red Wings wore {{a version of}} the <b>sweaters</b> worn by the Detroit Cougars in 1926-27, their first season in the NHL, but with their familiar [...] "Winged Wheel" [...] logo on the shoulders. The Blackhawks wore <b>sweaters</b> which were a mix of their 1936-37 <b>sweaters</b> and their 1937-38 <b>sweaters,</b> with the design from 1936-37 and the chest crest from 1937-38.|$|R
5|$|In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting {{his players}} {{to be more}} {{distinctly}} dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for {{the origin of the}} white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless <b>sweater</b> over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 Cohen {{approached}} May Cutler, {{founder of}} Tundra Books, {{to create an}} illustrated children's book of the story. It was published in 1984 as The Hockey <b>Sweater,</b> and by 2014 had sold over 300,000 copies. Following {{the success of the}} book, Cutler asked Carrier to write three more stories of his childhood to be illustrated by Cohen, each covering a different sport in a different season. They were published as The Boxing Champion (1991), The Longest Home Run (1994) and The Basketball Player (1996).|$|E
5|$|Mark's ex-girlfriend, Lana Turnboldt, has {{a picnic}} with her fiancé at the secluded {{place in the}} mountains, where they {{discover}} Mr. Griffin's medicine bottle. The police investigate, and find Mr. Griffin's body buried nearby. However, police do not find the ring Mr. Griffin was wearing when he died as David had taken it. Irma Ruggles, David's paternal grandmother who lives with him, discovers the ring and refuses {{to give it back}} to him, believing the ring to be that of David's father who had left him. David tells Susan he took the ring and his grandmother found it, but they are unsuccessful at retrieving it from her, so Susan tells Mark about the situation because she feels he would know what to do. Irma Ruggles is later murdered, and a neighbor refers to the suspect as a boy in a brown <b>sweater.</b> Susan makes the connection, knowing that Mark has a brown <b>sweater</b> he wears all the time, and that Mark would stop at nothing to get what he needed – in this case, the ring.|$|E
50|$|Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior {{students}} wear white shirts, navy <b>sweaters,</b> {{and white}} socks. Seniors are given more uniform choices: navy shirts, white <b>sweaters,</b> and navy socks.|$|R
50|$|There {{has also}} been a great {{interest}} in Faroese <b>sweaters</b> from the TV series The Killing, where the popular main actress (Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, played by Sofie Gråbøl) wears Faroese <b>sweaters.</b> This has greatly increased the profile of the Faroe Islands, particularly within the fashion industry, as Faroese <b>sweaters</b> are sold in places such as Harrods.|$|R
50|$|The project {{originated}} with the Phillip Island Nature Park oil spill of January 2000 and was successfully completed, but the knitting pattern {{and call for}} volunteers to donate remained available online. Instead of the 100 or so <b>sweaters</b> needed, thousands were sent. The extra <b>sweaters</b> were stockpiled by the Tasmanian Conservation Trust. As of 2014, the Australia-based Penguin Foundation is still accepting handmade <b>sweaters</b> but no longer uses these for penguin rehabilitation. Instead, these <b>sweaters</b> are used to dress toy penguins which are then sold {{to raise money for}} the foundation.|$|R
5|$|Numerous honours were {{bestowed}} upon Richard throughout and following his career: the Canadian Press named him its male {{athlete of the}} year on three occasions, and in 1957, Richard won the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada's {{athlete of the year}}. The Canadiens retired his <b>sweater</b> number 9 in 1960, while the Hockey Hall of Fame waived its five-year waiting period after retirement and inducted him in 1961. That same year, the 5,000-seat Maurice Richard Arena was built and named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, 2017, the Devils {{revealed}} {{their new}} uniforms for the 2017–18 season. Made by Adidas, the new sweaters {{are the first}} major change to the team's look since they replaced green with black. They feature {{the removal of the}} stripes {{on the bottom of the}} <b>sweater,</b> and also thicker sleeve stripes with equal width bands of white and black.|$|E
5|$|The Hockey <b>Sweater</b> is Carrier's {{most famous}} work and is {{considered}} an iconic piece of Canadian literature. The story has sold over 300,000 copies and has been republished in numerous anthologies. It exemplifies the nation's passion for hockey, {{and while it is}} often considered an allegory of the relationship and tensions that exist between francophones and anglophones, the story is popular throughout the entire nation. A line from the story appears on Canadian five-dollar bills printed between 2001 and 2013.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sweaters</b> {{are worn}} by adults and {{children}} of all genders; often over a shirt, blouse, T-shirt, or other top, but sometimes next to the skin. <b>Sweaters</b> were traditionally made from wool, but can now be made of cotton, synthetic fibers, or any combination thereof. <b>Sweaters</b> are maintained by washing or dry cleaning, {{and the use of}} a lint roller or pill razor.|$|R
25|$|There {{has also}} been a great {{interest}} in Faroese <b>sweaters</b> from the TV series The Killing, where the main actress (Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, played by Sofie Gråbøl) wears Faroese <b>sweaters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Clancy Brothers mother read news of {{the terrible}} ice and snow storms in New York City and sent Aran <b>sweaters</b> for her sons and Tommy Makem to keep them warm. They wore the <b>sweaters</b> {{for the first time}} at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan, simply as part of their regular winter clothes. When the groups manager Marty Erlichman, who had been searching for a special [...] "look" [...] for the group, saw the <b>sweaters,</b> he exclaimed, [...] "Thats it! Thats it! Thats what youre going to wear." [...] Ehrlichman {{requested}} that the group wear the <b>sweaters</b> on their upcoming television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. After they did, the sales of Aran <b>sweaters</b> rose by 700% according to Liam Clancy, and they soon became the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makems trademark costume.|$|R
5|$|The ears {{have been}} ornamented with jewelry for {{thousands}} of years, traditionally by piercing of the earlobe. In ancient and modern cultures, ornaments have been placed to stretch and enlarge the earlobes, allowing for larger plugs to be slid into a large fleshy gap in the lobe. Tearing of the earlobe from the weight of heavy earrings, or from traumatic pull of an earring (for example, by snagging on a <b>sweater),</b> is fairly common.|$|E
5|$|Uniforms are {{provided}} at no charge. Cadets {{are responsible for}} care, cleaning and custody of the issued kit and also to return it when ceasing to be a cadet. The uniform includes: wedge, wide-brimmed tan summer hat, toque, rank slip-ons, short-sleeved shirt, necktie, T-shirt, turtleneck <b>sweater,</b> jacket (tunic), jacket belt, trousers, trousers belt, all-season jacket, boots, grey wool socks, running shoes, grey sports shorts, and blue sports T-shirt.|$|E
5|$|Along with Lou Holtz, Parseghian {{served as}} one of two honorary coaches in Notre Dame's 2007 spring game, an annual {{scrimmage}} held in April. Holtz's Gold team defeated Parseghian's Blue team, 10–6. The same year, Notre Dame unveiled a statue in Parseghian's honor by sculptor Jerry McKenna, depicting players carrying him off the field in triumph following the 1971 Cotton Bowl victory over Texas. In 2011, Miami also unveiled a statue in his honor {{to add to the}} RedHawks' Cradle of Coaches plaza. It shows him wearing a Notre Dame <b>sweater</b> as he kneels and looks ahead to the field.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} {{closures}} {{is an important}} practical consideration and can also help define the <b>sweater's</b> style. Buttons and zippers {{are the most common}} choices for <b>sweaters,</b> but frogs, ties and belts are also seen.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 N.Peal {{supplied}} 25 custom-made identical cashmere <b>sweaters</b> {{to be worn}} by Daniel Craig as James Bond in Skyfall. The large {{quantity of}} <b>sweaters</b> was required so that the garments would appear pristine in each take.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1940s {{came the}} iconic wearing of body-skimming <b>sweaters</b> by sex symbols like Lana Turner and Jane Russell, though the 1950s were {{dominated}} by conservative popcorn knits. [...] The swinging 1960s were famously manifested in Missoni's colorful zigzag knitwear. [...] This era also saw the rise both of Sonia Rykiel, dubbed the [...] "Queen of Knitwear" [...] for her vibrant striped <b>sweaters</b> and her clingy dresses, and of Kennedy-inspired preppy <b>sweaters.</b>|$|R
5|$|Finn and Jake, after {{acquiring}} the legendary gauntlet of Billy {{as well as}} a special pink <b>sweater</b> made by Bubblegum, give chase, but they are consistently interrupted by the Ice King, who keeps trying to get Finn and Jake's blessings to marry Bubblegum. Fed up with their dismissive attitude, the Ice King kidnaps Bubblegum and follows Finn and Jake as the two heroes pursue the Lich. The Lich eventually reaches his lair, an abandoned subway station, and creates a pool of green liquid which he plans to use to regain his strength and destroy the world.|$|E
5|$|For {{the period}} of 1894 to 1900, the club did not win the league championship, {{finishing}} as high as second several times, and fifth (last) once. For the 1896–97 season, the Ottawa club unveiled the first use of the 'barber-pole' style sweaters of horizontal bars of black, red and white. This basic style would {{be used by the}} club until 1954 except for the 1900 and 1901 seasons, when the team used a plain <b>sweater</b> with only the letter 'O' on the front, identical in design to the sweaters of the Ottawa Football Club, also an OAAA affiliate.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the <b>sweater</b> Henderson wore while {{scoring the}} decisive final {{goal of the}} series was put up for auction by an {{anonymous}} American collector.

It was also announced that Goldhar would be taking it {{on a tour of}} Canada, the locations of which to be decided by voters on Facebook.|$|E
50|$|Later, NHL referees wore cream-colored <b>sweaters</b> over a {{shirt and}} tie, from the 1930s to the early 1950s. They then briefly wore orange <b>sweaters</b> with half-zip fronts (and without neckties), until the black-and-white-striped jersey was {{introduced}} in 1955.|$|R
