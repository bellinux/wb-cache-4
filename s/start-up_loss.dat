40|$|Abstract: Although clock {{synchronization}} in packet-oriented networks is beneficial for distributed real-time systems only the behaviour of the used algorithms in static cases and idealised environments are well documented. Due {{to the great}} complexity in larger networks and the interrelation of hardware, software, and synchronization algorithms, transient states (e. g., <b>start-up,</b> <b>loss</b> of a node or new network topology) cannot be analysed using analytical methods. The present paper proposes a network simulation environment which allows to gain new knowledge about the synchonization behaviour in non-static real-world cases. Further, the simulator will give insights into {{the importance of the}} influence on the accuracy of the different network layers. Consequently the critical elements in time synchronized distributed systems should be identifiable. Copyright c○ 2005 IFA...|$|E

30|$|The three non-technical {{factors related}} to the message content were: (1) “the frame {{of the content of}} the basic message” (with two levels: gains {{associated}} with business <b>start-up,</b> <b>loss</b> by not starting a business), (2) “the advantage of entrepreneurship” (with two levels: advantages to the individual, advantages to the society), and (3) “the inclusion of emotions in the film’s content as a motivational element” (two levels: Yes: include anticipated emotions, No: include no emotions). According to message framing theory, how something is presented to the audience (called “the frame”) influences the choice people make about how to process that information (Rothman and Salovey, 1997). For example, gain-framed appeals (i.e., the potential benefits of the action) {{have been found to be}} more effective in persuading people compared to loss-framed appeals such as the potential side-effects (Rothman et al. 2006).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology and successful application of structural optimization of a T-pipe under transient thermal and mechanical loads. In {{order to find}} the optimal shape of a thick-walled power boiler component, a parametric FE model and the evolutionary algorithm (EA) are applied. The power boiler start-up and shutdown curves {{are based on the}} TRD 301 guidelines. Maximum total stresses are assumed as optimization constraints. The obtained geometry is by about 18. 6 % lighter than the original one due to thinning of the walls. Maximum tensile and compressive stresses in the modified geometry are smaller than in the original one during the whole cycle. Additionally, lower total stress values are recorded during heating and cooling processes. Therefore, these transient processes can be accelerated and the shutdown and <b>start-up</b> <b>losses</b> can be reduced...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the headway {{distribution}} of queued vehicles (less than 16 vehicles) at signalized intersections. Existing studies usually take the average statistics of headway at any queuing place. When different percentile points of statistical data are assigned to headway, the passing rate (the rate of all queued vehicles passing the stop line) under the ideal signal timing scheme varies. When selecting the mean value, the passing rate of a queue of fewer than 16 vehicles is no more than 65 %. When selecting 75 % as the percentile, the passing rate is up to 94 %. The queue length also decides the assigned percentile of headway to ensure the passing rate reaches a certain level. The value assignation of headway directly affects lane capacity and <b>start-up</b> <b>loss</b> time. This paper provides a new perspective on parameter calibration and will make the signal timing algorithm method more effective...|$|E

40|$|This {{is a brief}} {{account of}} {{research}} by CAB staff. The success of Air New England {{from the beginning of}} its corporate life to the summer of 1974, when it was offered a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the CAB, can be attributed to a number of factors. The foremost was capable management. The management team at Air New England had previous experience operating commuter airlines in the New England area and was aware of the two major pitfalls that would undermine profitability, excess capacity and high corporate overhead, and was careful to avoid them. Further, the regulatory environment in which the commuters operated was such as to allow various competitive marketing strategies to be tried by management, such as modifying fare structures, flying different routings, and changing frequencies on routes. Additionally, the area chosen for initial market penetration, the Cape and Islands, was dense enough to support a number of airlines during the peak season, and allowed Air New England to minimize its <b>start-up</b> <b>losses.</b> Air New England's management was, of course, aware of the financial situation at Executive, its major established competitor. Air New England realized that if it was able to control its own costs, the financial difficulties that had existed at Executive during previous years would eventually lead to the disappearance of that particular competitor. (Of course, the possibility always existed that new commuters could also appear.) Thus, the emergence of Air New England as the dominant commuter air carrier in New England was a combination of management skills in all areas of airline operations combined with mismanagement on the part of their competitors. In the summer of 1974 Air New England's future was bright.

40|$|The {{transient}} {{behaviors of}} natural circulation loop (NCL) {{are important for}} the system reliability under postulated accidents. The heat loss and structure thermal inertia may influence the transient behaviors of NCL greatly, so a transient analysis model with consideration of heat loss was developed based on the MATLAB/Simulink to predict the thermal-hydraulic characteristic of liquid metal NCL. The transient processes including the <b>start-up,</b> the <b>loss</b> of pump, and the shutdown of thermal-hydraulic ADS lead bismuth loop (TALL) experimental facility were simulated by using the model. A good agreement is obtained to validate the transient model. The appended structure would provide significant thermal inertia and flatten the temperature distribution in the transients. The oscillations of temperature and flow rate are also weakened. The temperature difference between hot leg and cold leg would increase with the decrease of heat loss, so the flow rate increases as well. However, a significant increase of hot section temperature may cause a failure of facility integrity due to the decrease of heat loss. Hence, the full power of the core tank may also be limited...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{pressure}} drop {{refers to the}} calculation of instantaneous {{pressure drop}} at each point through the crank rotation. The horsepower cost is computed by integrating the instantaneous pressure drop over a cylinder cycle. If the instantaneous velocity across a square law restriction {{is much higher than}} the mean velocity, then the cycle integrated horsepower cost will be much higher than the horsepower cost estimated by mean flow estimates. Field analyses have documented instances where dynamic pressure drop effects have incurred hundreds of excess horsepower and, in some cases, were so high as to inhibit full load operations. In one such case, strong cylinder interactions combined with a significant pressure drop restriction downstream of the compressor cylinder valves resulted in excessive horsepower losses. This paper presents a case study of a low-speed reciprocating compressor unit installed in a natural gas transmission service. On-site testing following <b>start-up</b> indicated total <b>losses</b> of approximately 55 percent of the indicated horsepower while operating on the bottom load step at rated speed.

40|$|Partial {{differential}} equations describing the transient {{behavior of a}} non-adiabatic fixed-bed catalytic reactor are derived {{with a minimum of}} simplifying assumptions. These equations axe applied to predict the transient behavior of a reactor for the oxidation of SO 2 taking into account the behavior of both the fluid stream and the associated catalyst pellets. Stability analyses of the numerical methods of solving the equations are presented in great detail, as the methods of analyses available in the literature are inadequate for the complicated system of equations encountered. A special study is made of the effects on stability of various methods of handling the nonlinear source terms in the equations. Some of the schemes proposed in the literature are found to be subject to severe stability criteria. A method of obtaining a rigorous solution is devised. The method is always stable, and the use of varying time increment size is allowable. A rigorous solution takes only a few minutes of computer time with an IBM- 7094 computer. To investigate the effects of various limiting assumptions, three problems are studied using the rigorous method and also with methods employing various assumptions. These problems are the <b>start-up,</b> the <b>loss</b> of cooling with subsequent restoration, and the response of the exit concentration to a sinusoidal concentration forcing function at the entrance. For the system investigated, the effects of using an "effectiveness factor" model, neglecting radial changes, and neglecting the axial diffusion and axial velocity variations are found to be not large. The neglecting of reverse reactions, or the use of an average effectiveness factor throughout the whole reactor causes significant errors. A simplified method, which for the system studied, gives a reasonably good approximation to the true solution, is used to investigate problems in the optimization and control of the reactor. The frequency response of the exit temperature to a sinusoidal forcing upon the optimum wall temperature is found to be equivalent to that of a phase lag network frequently used in regulating systems. Limitations to the applicability of the simplified method are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{cold start}} {{performance}} of automotive diesel engines is currently poor {{when compared to}} similar gasoline units. This thesis describes an experimental and theoretical investigation into the factors limiting diesel cold start behaviour. Studies {{have been carried out}} on IDI and DI designs of engine. Start behaviour has been characterised in terms of times taken to complete various stages of startup, engine speed variations and processes which affect these. Combustion and friction behaviour have been investigated in detail. Engine friction losses are dependent on temperature. During <b>start-up</b> these <b>losses</b> are relatively high compared to those when the engine is fully-warm. The work output from combustion is low at low speeds, and prone to a further deterioration at lower temperatures. Consequently, combustion output during cold cranking is initially insufficient to overcome frictional losses. The start times are extended by the need to keep the starter motor engaged until heat generated in the engine causes frictional losses to fall. Eventually, when combustion output is able to overcome friction without the aid of starter motor work, idle speed is reached. Changes to fuel injection and glowplug parameters have been used to achieve a limited improvement in low-temperature starting. Measurements of engine friction have been carried out to determine the influence of temperature and speed, and the relative contributions from each of the main component assemblies. At low temperatures, much of the friction originates in hydrodynamically lubricated components such as journal bearings, due to high oil viscosity at low temperature. Additionally, engine friction as rotation begins {{has been shown to be}} far higher than measured by conventional "steady-state" motoring tests (over twice the quasi-steady state friction at - 200 e). This initially high friction transient decays towards the quasi-steady values throughout the start. For crankshaft bearings, a friction model has been developed for cold start-up through to fully warm engine conditions. The friction behaviour in the bearings is dependent on thermal conditions around the friction surfaces. Models for the starter system and blowby processes are also presented as part of a broader theoretical investigation to assess the impact of design changes on start quality...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{regions of}} Durham and York in Ontario, Canada have partnered to {{construct}} an energy-from-waste (EFW) thermal treatment facility {{as part of a}} long term strategy for the management of their municipal solid waste. In this paper we present the results of a comprehensive ecological risk assessment (ERA) for this planned facility, based on baseline sampling and site specific modeling to predict facility-related emissions, which was subsequently accepted by regulatory authorities. Emissions were estimated for both the approved initial operating design capacity of the facility (140, 000 tonnes per year) and the maximum design capacity (400, 000 tonnes per year). In general, calculated ecological hazard quotients (EHQs) and screening ratios (SRs) for receptors did not exceed the benchmark value (1. 0). The only exceedances noted were generally due to existing baseline media concentrations, which did not differ from those expected for similar unimpacted sites in Ontario. This suggests that these exceedances reflect conservative assumptions applied in the risk assessment rather than actual potential risk. However, under predicted upset conditions at 400, 000 tonnes per year (i. e., facility <b>start-up,</b> shutdown, and <b>loss</b> of air pollution control), a potential unacceptable risk was estimated for freshwater receptors with respect to benzo(g,h,i) perylene (SR= 1. 1), which could not be attributed to baseline conditions. Although this slight exceedance reflects a conservative worst-case scenario (upset conditions coinciding with worst-case meteorological conditions), further investigation of potential ecological risk should be performed if this facility is expanded to the maximum operating capacity in the future...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{regions of}} Durham and York in Ontario, Canada have partnered to {{construct}} an energy-from-waste thermal treatment facility {{as part of a}} long term strategy for the management of their municipal solid waste. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive human health risk assessment for this facility. This assessment was based on extensive sampling of baseline environmental conditions (e. g., collection and analysis of air, soil, water, and biota samples) as well as detailed site specific modeling to predict facility-related emissions of 87 identified contaminants of potential concern. Emissions were estimated for both the approved initial operating design capacity of the facility (140, 000 tonnes per year) and for the maximum design capacity (400, 000 tonnes per year). For the 140, 000 tonnes per year scenario, this assessment indicated that facility-related emissions are unlikely to cause adverse health risks to local residents, farmers, or other receptors (e. g., recreational users). For the 400, 000 tonnes per year scenarios, slightly elevated risks were noted with respect to inhalation (hydrogen chloride) and infant consumption of breast milk (dioxins and furans), but only during predicted ‘upset conditions’ (i. e. facility <b>start-up,</b> shutdown, and <b>loss</b> of air pollution control) that represent unusual and/or transient occurrences. However, current provincial regulations require that additional environmental screening would be mandatory prior to expansion of the facility beyond the initial approved capacity (140, 000 tonnes per year). Therefore, the potential risks due to upset conditions for the 400, 000 tonnes per year scenario should be more closely investigated if future expansion is pursued...|$|R
