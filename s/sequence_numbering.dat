50|$|Lollipop <b>sequence</b> <b>numbering</b> was {{originally}} believed {{to resolve the}} ambiguity problem in cyclic <b>sequence</b> <b>numbering</b> schemes, and was used in OSPF version 1 for this reason. Later work showed {{that this was not}} the case, and OSPF version 2 replaced it with a linear numbering space, with special rules for what happens when the sequence numbers reach the end of the numbering space.|$|E
50|$|Connection-oriented {{transport}} layer protocols provide connection-oriented communications over connectionless communications systems. A connection-oriented {{transport layer}} protocol, such as TCP, may {{be based on}} a connectionless network layer protocol (such as IP), but still achieves in-order delivery of a byte-stream, by means of segment <b>sequence</b> <b>numbering</b> on the sender side, packet buffering and data packet reordering on the receiver side. The <b>sequence</b> <b>numbering</b> requires two-way synchronization of segment counters during a three-step connection establishment phase.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sequence</b> <b>Number</b> (32 bits) : A {{monotonic}} strictly increasing <b>sequence</b> <b>number</b> (incremented by 1 {{for every}} packet sent) to prevent replay attacks. When replay detection is enabled, <b>sequence</b> <b>numbers</b> are never reused, because a new security association must be renegotiated before {{an attempt to}} increment the <b>sequence</b> <b>number</b> beyond its maximum value.|$|R
50|$|To {{avoid these}} problems, {{the most common}} {{solution}} is to define a 1 bit <b>sequence</b> <b>number</b> in the header of the frame. This <b>sequence</b> <b>number</b> alternates (from 0 to 1) in subsequent frames. When the receiver sends an ACK, it includes the <b>sequence</b> <b>number</b> of the next packet it expects. This way, the receiver can detect duplicated frames by checking if the frame <b>sequence</b> <b>numbers</b> alternate. If two subsequent frames have the same <b>sequence</b> <b>number,</b> they are duplicates, and the second frame is discarded. Similarly, if two subsequent ACKs reference the same <b>sequence</b> <b>number,</b> they are acknowledging the same frame.|$|R

50|$|If the SYN flag is set (1), {{then this}} is the initial <b>sequence</b> <b>number.</b> The <b>sequence</b> <b>number</b> of the actual first data byte and the {{acknowledged}} number in the corresponding ACK are then this <b>sequence</b> <b>number</b> plus 1.|$|R

50|$|Lollipop <b>sequence</b> <b>{{numbering}}</b> is a {{numbering scheme}} used in routing protocols. In this numbering scheme, sequence numbers start at a negative value, increase {{until they reach}} zero, then cycles through a finite set of positive numbers indefinitely. When a system is rebooted, the sequence is restarted from a negative number again. This allows recently rebooted systems to be distinguished from systems which have simply looped around their numbering space. This path can be visualized as a line with a circle at the end; hence a lollipop.|$|E
30|$|RTP {{defines a}} packet format for {{delivering}} data with real-time characteristics, such as interactive audio and video. Moreover, RTP includes payload type identification, <b>sequence</b> <b>numbering,</b> and timestamping that {{are intended to}} ease {{the management of the}} transmission. However, RTP does not include protection mechanisms. Therefore, in order to avoid losses at a packet level, it is necessary to add complementary recovery modules.|$|E

30|$|Initially, each server s sends signed <b>sequence</b> <b>numbers</b> 1 through K to each client c, {{and sets}} the next <b>sequence</b> <b>number</b> to emit, N_s^c, to K+ 1. Whenever s accepts to certify a new transaction, s {{increments}} N_s^c and sends N_s^c signed to c. Server s only accepts to certify transactions whose <b>sequence</b> <b>numbers</b> belong to set V_s^c. Initially, this set contains <b>sequence</b> <b>numbers</b> 1 to K. Each time s accepts to certify a transaction with <b>sequence</b> <b>number</b> seq, seq is removed from V_s^c and N_s^c {{is added to the}} set after being incremented.|$|R

30|$|The two FEC streams shall use {{the same}} IP {{destination}} address (either unicast or multicast) for the associated media stream, but they must address different UDP destination ports {{in order to have}} independent packet <b>sequence</b> <b>numbering</b> for the two streams. This allows backward compatibility toward Level A receivers that are able to manage only one FEC stream. If the packet streams are sent to port N, the first FEC stream has to be sent to port N + 2, while the second FEC stream, when used, shall be sent to port N + 4.|$|E

NROFF and TROFF offer unusual freedom in document styling, including: arbitrary style headers and footers; arbitrary style footnotes; multiple automatic <b>sequence</b> <b>numbering</b> for paragraphs, sections, etc; multiple column output; dynamic font and point-size control; arbitrary horizontal and vertical local motions at any point; and a family of automatic overstriking, bracket construction, and line drawing functions.

Here, we test the hypothesis that deficient endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphory-lation is an important cause of diabetic vascular dysfunction, and that its modulation can change the outcome to a disease model in vivo. eNOS phosphorylation at serine 1177 (human <b>sequence</b> <b>numbering),</b> or its equivalent in other species, has been studied. 2 – 5 This site is phosphorylated by Akt kinase, 2, 3 AMP kinase, 6 and protein kinase A, 7 resulting in a con-formational change, enhancing electron flux through the reductase domain, and increasing NO production. 8 eNOS-derived NO plays known protective roles in cerebral ischemia, including maintenance of cerebral blood flo...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a computer graphics program system for the schematic representation of several protein secondary structure analysis algorithms. The programs calculate the probability of occurrence of alpha-helix, beta-sheet and beta-turns by the method of Chou and Fasman and assign unique predicted structure to each residue using a novel conflict resolution algorithm based on maximum likelihood. A detailed structure map containing secondary structure, hydrophobicity, sequence identity, <b>sequence</b> <b>numbering</b> {{and the location of}} putative N-linked glycosylation sites is then produced. In addition, helical wheel diagrams and hydrophobic moment calculations can be performed to further analyze the properties of selected regions of the sequence. As they require only structure specification as input, the graphics programs can easily be adapted for use with other secondary structure prediction schemes. The use of these programs to analyze protein structure-function relationships is described and evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{a packet}} {{switched}} wireless communication system {{such as in}} the Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) Long term Evolution (LTE), the data packets are forwarded between base stations (BSs) during handover over the backhaul. The Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) of the source base station (BS) is responsible for forwarding the data packets to the target BS. This paper gives the analysis of earlier approaches to efficient data transfer among BSs during handover and gives two new approaches for efficient data transfer to overcome the drawbacks of the previous approach. Learning that frequent User Equipment (UE) polling causes too much load on uplink network, it is suggested that a single poll to UE on handover request is sufficient to transfer data efficiently with one poll delay time. Using fragmentation and reassembly and <b>sequence</b> <b>numbering</b> concept of IP we can even cut the single poll delay...|$|E

30|$|A <b>sequence</b> <b>number</b> and a loop flag are {{included}} in the data packet header and are used to detect routing loops. When a node receives a downstream data packet, the node records the <b>sequence</b> <b>number</b> of the data. When a node receives data with the same <b>sequence</b> <b>number,</b> the node judges that a loop has occurred and sets the loop flag to one. Each node records nhist <b>sequence</b> <b>numbers</b> of received packets from the newest received one.|$|R
