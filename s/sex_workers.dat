25|$|As raids {{occur to}} brothels that may house <b>sex</b> <b>workers</b> {{as well as}} sex trafficked victims, raids affect <b>sex</b> <b>workers</b> in general.

Underground interactions means that <b>sex</b> <b>workers</b> take greater risks, where as otherwise they would be cooperating with other <b>sex</b> <b>workers</b> and with sex worker organizations to report violence and protect each other.
