5|$|The Olympic Village {{for housing}} athletes {{during the games}} {{would have been a}} $1.1-billion series of newly {{constructed}} lakefront buildings that would have been converted to rental and condominium units after the games. The village was to be located immediately south of McCormick Place, which was expected to host 11 event venues, on a current truck parking lot between South Lake <b>Shore</b> <b>Drive</b> and the Illinois Central Railroad tracks in the Near South Side and Douglas community areas. At the time, the parking lot was being used to stage events at McCormick Place. The village was slated to have pedways over Lake <b>Shore</b> <b>Drive.</b> This location was meant to enable 88% of the Olympic athletes to be within 15 minutes of their competition venue.|$|E
5|$|A $2.5 {{million bond}} issue passed in 1922 for a stadium {{conceived}} by Burnham. Designed by architects Holabird & Roche and named Soldier Field for {{the veterans of}} World War I, cost overruns required another bond issue in 1926. By 1924, the breakwater wall stretched from 14th to 55th Streets. In 1926, Soldier Field and a portion of Lake <b>Shore</b> <b>Drive</b> were opened. Landfilling extended from 23rd Street to 56th Street; however, Promontory Point was not complete, prompting complaints regarding garbage, blowing sand and odors. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, landfill efforts continued to fill in Burnham Park and the adjacent Northerly Island. The South Development was named for Daniel Burnham on January 14, 1927, and support increased for a world's fair in the park. Construction was completed on Lake <b>Shore</b> <b>Drive,</b> with northbound lanes named for Leif Erikson, and southbound lanes for Christopher Columbus. In 1929, construction of the park at Promontory Point began. The Great Depression delayed work and prevented construction of nearshore islands. Burnham Park was chosen for {{the site of the}} Century of Progress world's fair and a yacht basin was built south of 51st Street.|$|E

5|$|The Chicago Spire was a supertall {{skyscraper}} {{project at}} 400 N. Lake <b>Shore</b> <b>Drive</b> in Chicago, Illinois that failed financially after beginning construction. When originally proposed as the Fordham Spire in July 2005, the design had 116 stories {{and would have}} included a hotel and condominiums and been topped with a broadcast antenna mast. The design was by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, and Chicago developer Christopher T. Carley of the Fordham Company was spearheading the project. On 16 March 2006, the initial design of the building passed unanimously during that day's meeting of the Chicago Plan Commission. A court ruling on 4 November 2014 brought to a close the original development plan and the extended litigation over the nine-year-old project; developer Garrett Kelleher signed over the property location to the project's biggest creditor, Related Midwest, who announced {{that they would not}} build the Spire.|$|E

Travelers to and from Virginia Beach can access the Hampton Roads Beltway in either direction from I-264 in Norfolk to use a choice of the two bridge-tunnel facilities to cross Hampton Roads to reach the Peninsula, Williamsburg, Richmond and points north. Other major roads include Virginia Beach Boulevard (U.S. Route 58), <b>Shore</b> <b>Drive</b> (U.S. Route 60), which connects to Atlantic Avenue at the oceanfront, Northampton Blvd (U.S. Route 13), Princess Anne Road (State Route 165), Indian River Road (former State Route 603), Lynnhaven Parkway, Independence Boulevard, General Booth Boulevard, and Nimmo Parkway.
