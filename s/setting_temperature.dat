5000|$|The term [...] "fixed pattern noise" [...] usually {{refers to}} two parameters. One is the DSNU (dark signal non-uniformity), {{which is the}} offset from the average across the imaging array at a {{particular}} <b>setting</b> (<b>temperature,</b> integration time) but no external illumination and the PRNU (photo response non-uniformity), which describes the gain or ratio between optical power on a pixel versus the electrical signal output. The latter is often simplified as a single value measured at e.g. 50% saturation level, implying a linear approximation of the not perfectly linear photo response photo response non-linearity (PRNL). [...] Often PRNU as defined above is subdivided in pure [...] "(offset) FPN" [...] which is the part not dependent on temperature and integration time, and the integration time and temperature dependent [...] "DSNU".Sometimes pixel noise as the average deviation from the array average under different illumination and temperature conditions is specified. Pixel noise therefore gives a number (commonly expressed in rms) that identifies FPN in all permitted imaging conditions, which might strongly deteriorate if additional electrical gain (and noise) is included.|$|E

40|$|Study Design. A {{review of}} the {{laboratory}} and clinical data for a new strontium-containing hydroxyapatite bioactive bone cement. Objectives. To compare {{the properties of the}} strontium-containing bioactive bone cement with those of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and hydroxyapatite (HA) bone cements. Summary of Background Data. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty using conventional PMMA bone cements have been effectively used to treat osteoporotic spine fractures with good short- and medium-term results. However, PMMA has some undesirable properties, including its high <b>setting</b> <b>temperature,</b> lack of osseointegration, and large stiffness mismatch with osteoporotic bone. These properties are responsible for some postoperative complications. Methods. Strontium-containing hydroxyapatite (Sr-HA) bioactive bone cement consists of a filler blend of strontium-containing hydroxyapatite, fumed silica and benzoyl peroxide; and a resin blend of bisphenol A diglycidylether methacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate, and N, N-dimethyl-p-toluidine. Its properties, including mechanical strength, <b>setting</b> <b>temperature,</b> biocompatibility, and osseoinduction, were compared with other cements in vitro and in vivo. Early clinical results are presented. Results. The Sr-HA cement has a setting time of 15 to 18 minutes, a maximum <b>setting</b> <b>temperature</b> of 58 ° C, a compressive strength of 40. 9 MPa, bending strength of 31. 3 MPa, and a bending modulus of 1, 408 MPa. The bending strength and modulus are closer to human cancellous bone. Sr-HA cement promotes osteoblast attachment and mineralization in vitro and bone growth and osseointegration in vivo. In a pilot study, 23 cases of osteoporotic fractures treated with this cement with a mean follow-up of 18 months suggest that it is as effective as PMMA in relieving pain. Discussions. Oral strontium has been shown to induce new bone formation and is effective in reducing fracture risk in osteoporosis. Our data suggest that strontium delivered locally has the same effect; thus, the combination of strontium with HA in a cement with a low <b>setting</b> <b>temperature,</b> adequate stiffness, and low viscosity makes this a good bioactive cement for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. © 2005, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

In a house, the largest load with a thermal cycle is often the heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. So the thermal dynamics of typical residential electric air conditioner is discussed, and then an equivalent thermal parameters (ETP) model is built by the thermal equilibrium in this paper. Based on this, the switch status, indoor air temperature and power consumption are simulated through control strategies of constant thermostat set point. The results show according the switch status, indoor air temperature can be calculated by the ETP model, thus give the desire status to the grid according the <b>setting</b> <b>temperature.</b> In summer, with the increasing of <b>setting</b> <b>temperature,</b> the frequency of on-off becomes lower, thus the power consumption also reduces from 1200 kW (26 °C) to 970 kW (27 °C).

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and mechanical testing were conducted to study the particular thermal/mechanical properties of shape memory polyurethane fiber in comparison with other man-made fibers such as nylon 6, polyester, Lycra and XLA. In addition, {{in the preparation of}} shape memory polyurethane fiber, the effect of thermal <b>setting</b> <b>temperature</b> was systematically investigated by mechanical properties testing, DMA and cyclic tensile testing, suggesting that the thermal <b>setting</b> <b>temperature</b> has a huge influence on the mechanical properties and shape memory property due to the elimination of internal stress. Thermal setting with a higher temperature will give rise to a lower tensile modulus and tenacity and a higher elongation ratio at break. Through employing the optimal thermal setting treatment, the complete heating responsive recovery in SMPU fiber can be achieved because of the counteracting effect of the irreversible strain and thermal shrinkage.

In pyrolysis, we have conducted experimentally about char formation and gas products of woody biomass in slow pyrolysis. In the investigation of char formation, a packed bed of biomass particles undergoing pyrolysis has been two-dimensionally visualized. For char formation investigation, the <b>setting</b> <b>temperature</b> of the furnace was changed from 523 K to 1073 K and for gas product investigation, the setting temperatures were carried out from 673 K to 1073 K.

From the experimental results, {{it was found that}} the char formation process was closely connected with the pyrolysis and divided three regions; i) region of dehydration from biomass, ii) region of pyrolysis of cellulose and iii) region of pyrolysis of lignin.

40|$|Variations in {{chemical}} and gelling characteristics of hybrid carrageenan extracted from Mastocarpus stellatus seaweeds are studied {{in order to}} explore potential links between the seaweeds life phase, the seaweeds postharvest storage duration and the phycocolloids properties. Chemical structures of phycocolloids were assessed by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Rheological properties of hybrid carrageenans, such as intrinsic viscosity ([η]), gel elasticity (G 0), gel <b>setting</b> <b>temperature</b> (Tg) and gel melting temperature (Tm), were measured with a stress rheometer. Seasonal variation {{in the degree of}} sulphates of native extracts and in their corresponding gelling properties is found. The minimum in gelling properties coincides with a minimum of fructified gametophytes in populations harvested during the cold season. Alkali treated extracts also show minimum gelling properties during the cold season but no correlation with variations in the chemical characteristics could be identified. The gel <b>setting</b> <b>temperature</b> is the only significant change in the properties of hybrid carrageenans extracted from dried seaweeds stored over 39 months in opaque and sealed plastic bags.
