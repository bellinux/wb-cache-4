40|$|The {{integration}} of mathematical modeling and experimental testing {{is emerging as}} a powerful approach for improving {{our understanding of the}} regulation of metabolic pathways. In this study, we report on the development of a kinetic mathematical model that accurately simulates the developmental patterns of monoterpenoid essential oil accumulation in peppermint (Mentha × piperita). This model was then used to evaluate the biochemical processes underlying experimentally determined changes in the monoterpene pathway under low ambient-light intensities, which led to an accumulation of the branchpoint intermediate (+) -pulegone and the side product (+) -menthofuran. Our simulations indicated that the environmentally regulated changes in monoterpene profiles could only be explained when, in addition to effects on biosynthetic enzyme activities, as yet unidentified inhibitory effects of (+) -menthofuran on the branchpoint enzyme pulegone reductase (PR) were assumed. Subsequent in vitro analyses with recombinant protein confirmed that (+) -menthofuran acts as a weak competitive inhibitor of PR (Ki = 300 μM). To evaluate whether the intracellular concentration of (+) -menthofuran was high enough for PR inhibition in vivo, we isolated essential oil-synthesizing secretory cells from peppermint leaves and subjected them to <b>steam</b> <b>distillations.</b> When peppermint plants were grown under low-light conditions, (+) -menthofuran was selectively retained in secretory cells and accumulated to very high levels (up to 20 mM), whereas under regular growth conditions, (+) -menthofuran levels remained very low (< 400 μM).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Biobutanol is {{primarily}} {{used as a}} solvent or component in surface coatings. It has characteristics similar to petroleum fuel and is considered as a superior biofuel to ethanol. Biobutanol is more energy dense and less hygroscopic than ethanol, resulting in higher possible blending ratios with gasoline.
