5|$|Not {{much had}} {{changed by the}} 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45am. After a {{prisoner}} count, they moved into the yard until 7:30, when they collected breakfast {{and headed back to}} their cells. The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> which lasted until 11:15. They ate a meal, locked in their cells until 12:20pm, followed by some time in the yards. At 1:00 there was another parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another meal was collected, and prisoners were locked away in their cells overnight. The lights stayed on until 9:30pm. On the weekends the routine featured no work, and included a film played for the prisoners.|$|E
25|$|The unusual {{choice of}} host proved {{an issue for}} {{football}} fans in Europe, used to watching international matches on or close to their time zone.

25|$|The {{district}} court agreed, with one exception. The {{court found that}} the vast majority of employees were ready for work approximately five minutes before the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and that it seemed unreasonable that employees would not begin work as they were paid by piece rate. The court fashioned a formula for computing which employees were forced to wait. The {{district court}} then entered a judgment against Mt. Clemens Pottery Co. in the amount of $2,415.74.|$|E
25|$|To address transalpine freight and {{passenger}} bottlenecks on its roads and railways, Switzerland launched the Rail2000 and NRLA projects. The first stage of the Rail2000 project finished in 2005, included a new high-speed rail track between Bern and Olten with an operating speed of 200km/h. The NRLA project is building faster north-south rail tracks across the Swiss Alps by constructing base tunnels several hundred metres {{below the level of}} the current tunnels. The 35km Lötschberg Base Tunnel opened in 2007 where New Pendolino trains run at 250km/h. The 57km Gotthard Base Tunnel (Top speed 250km/h) was opened in 2016. The second stage of Rail2000 includes line upgrades in canton Valais (200km/h) and between Biel/Bienne and Solothurn (200km/h). The <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is planned for 2012–2016. However, the slow speed of lines between the NRLA tunnels (Ceneri, Gotthard Base and Zimmerberg to name but a few) means that the capacity of Zürich-Milan services will remain limited until the speeds can be increased, given the strong negative effect of mixed rail speeds on capacity.|$|E
25|$|The <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on Scar House Reservoir {{led to an}} {{overhaul}} of existing stock. Seven of the original Metropolitan Railway coaches were upholstered and repainted, while the remaining five {{were used for the}} workmen. A steam railmotor was obtained in 1921, which had previously been owned by the Great Western Railway. It was named Hill and was fitted with electric lights in 1923. It worked on the public section of the railway, and never travelled beyond Lofthouse. Numerous new and secondhand locomotives were purchased, most for use on construction work, but two, Blythe and Gadie, were fitted with vacuum brakes, and so worked goods trains from Pateley Bridge to Scar House, as well as passenger trains between Scar House and Lofthouse and sometimes Pateley Bridge. Passenger trains for the residents of Scar village ran on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, the mid-week ones connecting with Hill at Lofthouse, and the Saturday ones running through to Pateley Bridge. The 1927 printed timetable showed five trains a day between Pateley Bridge and Lofthouse, but also showed the trains onwards to Scar Village, with a note that these were for exclusive use of residents. Saturday trains were hauled by Blythe or Gadie, but were banked at the rear by another engine above Lofthouse because of the steep gradients.|$|E

500|$|The College of Arms {{produced}} two colours for the RLI, with Queen Elizabeth II giving final approval to a Queen's colour and a regimental colour on 15 July 1963. The {{first of these}} was a standard Union Flag design; the unit's name was marked on a circle, which was placed centrally and surmounted by a crown. The second {{was based on a}} dark green background and featured the regimental badge in its centre, surrounded by a wreath of flame lilies, Rhodesia's national flower, and topped, as with the Queen's colour, with the royal crown. The Battalion took part in Operation Zephyr {{during the second half of}} 1963, a counter-intimidation action against political agitators from the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). As with the previous posting to Kariba, little to no action was necessary; it was enough of a deterrent that troops were present. When the Federation broke up on the last day of 1963, members of the Federal Army could transfer to the Southern Rhodesian Army, request a posting to Northern Rhodesia, or leave the military altogether, receiving a monetary [...] "golden handshake" [...] if they chose the last option. So many servicemen chose to take the money and leave that [...] "only a handful", according to paymaster Lieutenant Paddy Leen, remained in the mess on 31 December 1963. Leen had paid off over 200 RLI men since the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on 30 December.|$|E
2500|$|Jean-Baptiste Colbert {{authorized}} the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> by royal edict in October, 1666, {{with the aim}} of developing the wheat trade, [...] under the supervision of Pierre-Paul Riquet, and construction lasted from 1666 to 1681, during the reign of Louis XIV. The Canal du Midi {{is one of the oldest}} canals of Europe still in operation (the prototype being the Briare Canal). The challenges in these works are closely related to the challenges of inland water transport today. The key challenge, raised by Pierre-Paul Riquet, was to convey water from the Montagne Noire (Black Mountains) to the Seuil de Naurouze, the highest point of the canal.|$|E

40|$|Using {{emotional}} labor and {{conservation of resources}} (COR) theory, this diary study aims to gain insight {{into the role of}} daily strain in {{emotional labor}} and service performance on a day-to-day basis. Strain was taken into account both as an antecedent (at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>work</b> shift), and as a consequence (at the end <b>of</b> the <b>work</b> shift) <b>of</b> emotional labor (surface acting, deep acting) and emotional dissonance. The participants were 53 Dutch police officers who completed a three-day diary questionnaire (i. e. 159 measurement occasions). The results of multilevel analyses showed that, as hypothesized, daily strain at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>work</b> shift was positively related to daily surface acting and unrelated to daily deep acting. Furthermore, daily surface acting mediated the relationship between strain at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>work</b> shift and (a) service performance and (b) strain at the end <b>of</b> the <b>work</b> shift. Additionally, as predicted, daily surface acting was particularly related to emotional dissonance when strain at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>work</b> shift was high...|$|R
