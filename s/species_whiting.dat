40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the quality changes in whole, gutted and filleted three fish <b>species,</b> <b>whiting</b> (Gadus euxinus), gray mullet (Mugil cephalus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicholus), at frozen storage period (&# 8211; 26 0;C). Throughout the storage period, anchovy had the lowest values in all sensorial criteria among the fish spe-cies. During the storage period, whiting kept its freshness better than gray mullet and an-chovy as to chemical criteria. The lowest TVB-N value (17. 23 mg/ 100 g) was determined in whiting whereas the highest value (22. 55 mg/ 100 g) in anchovy. The highest TMA value (3. 50 mg/ 100 g) was found in anchovy. The TBA values increased up to 9 th month, depending on fish species. Differences between the species are found to be significant and the highest TBA value (2. 55) was obtained in anchovy. Although the TBA and peroxide values in anchovy significantly increase when compared to the others during storage pe-riod, acceptable limits expired at the end of 9 th month. According to treatments, filleted fish had better color quality wheras gutted fish had better smell, muscle and taste...|$|E
40|$|Following {{the repeal}} in 1962 of a long-standing ban on trawling, yields of {{demersal}} {{fish from the}} Firth of Clyde, southwest Scotland, increased to a maximum in 1973 and then declined until the directed fishery effectively ceased in the early 2000 s. Since then, the only landings of demersal fish from the Firth have been by-catch in the Norway lobster fishery. We analysed changes in biomass density, species diversity and length structure of the demersal fish community between 1927 and 2009 from scientific trawl surveys, and related these to the fishery harvesting rate. As yields collapsed, the community transformed from a state in which biomass was distributed across numerous species (high species evenness) and large maximum length taxa were common, to one in which 90 per cent of the biomass was vested in one <b>species</b> (<b>whiting),</b> and both large individuals and large maximum length species were rare. Species evenness recovered quickly once the directed fishery ceased, but 10 years later, the community was still deficient in large individuals. The changes partly reflected events at a larger regional scale but were more extreme. The lag in response with respect to fishing has implications for attempts at managing a restoration of the ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|The {{levels of}} {{individual}} PBDE congeners were investigated in the invertebrate species whelk (Buccinum undatum), seastar (Asterias rubens), and hermit crab (Pagurus bernhardus), the gadoid fish <b>species</b> <b>whiting</b> (Merlangius merlangus) and cod (Gadus morhua), and the marine mammal species harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). These species are all important representatives of different trophic {{levels of the}} North Sea food web. All six major PBDE congeners detected (BDEs 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154) are most prevalent in the commercial Penta-BDE formulation. There is no evidence for the occurrence of the Octa-BDE formulation in the North Sea food web, since its dominant congener, BDE 183, was never detected. BDE 209, the main congener (> 97 €in the Deca-BDE formulation, was detected only in {{a minority of the}} samples and always in concentrations around the limit of detection. Since BDE 209 is often the major BDE congener in sediments from the area, the main reason for its low concentrations in biota from the North Sea seems to be a relatively low bioaccumulation potential. This can either be due to a low uptake rate of the very large molecule or a relatively rapid excretion after biotransformation. Since all invertebrates investigated are sentinel species, they are highly representative for the area of capture. The highest lipid-normalized concentrations of PBDEs in the invertebrates occurred near the mouth of the river Tees at the East coast of the UK. The geographical distribution of the PBDEs {{can be explained by the}} residual currents in the area. The direction of these currents differs between the summer and the winter season as a result of the presence or absence of vertical summer stratification of the deeper waters north of the Dogger Bank. Summer stratification results in the development of a density-driven bottom water current formed after the onset of vertical stratification of the water column in May leaving the UK coast near Flamborough Head toward the Dogger Bank. In winter, the residual currents run in a more southerly direction and follow the UK coastline. The distribution pattern of the PCBs and p,p'-DDE in the invertebrates was entirely different from that of the PBDEs, which could be expected, since the use of these organochlorines in western Europe peaked in the 1960 s and 1970 s but has been forbidden more than two decades ago, whereas the production and use of the penta-BDE formulation is of a more recent origin. The higher trophic levels of the North Sea food web were represented by the predatory gadoid fish <b>species</b> <b>whiting</b> and cod and the marine mammal species harbor seal and harbor porpoise. The lipid-normalized levels of the six major PBDE congeners in fish were similar to the levels in the invertebrates, but a biomagnification step in concentrations of generally more than an order of magnitude occurred from gadoid fish to marine mammals. Based on the limited number of samples, no differences could be observed between harbor seal and harbor porpoise. In summary, the results in three species of sentinel invertebrates from a network of stations covering a major part of the North Sea basin showed that the estuary of the river Tees at the UK East coast is a major source for tri- to hexa-PBDEs. Throughout the food-chain, the most marked increase in (lipid-normalized) levels of all six PBDE congeners occurred from predatory (gadoid) fish to marine mammals, agreeing with the transition from gill-breathing to lung-breathing animals. This has serious consequences for the route of elimination of POPs, since their elimination from the blood into the ambient seawater via the gill-membrane is no longer possible...|$|E

40|$|Neutral {{microsatellite}} markers {{were used}} to analyse genetic variation in three demersal finfish <b>species,</b> <b>whiting</b> (Merlangius merlangus) haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) in the north east Atlantic.   For each species samples were collected from the North Sea and west of the British Isles while geographically distant samples were also collected from Icelandic waters.   In {{the case of the}} anglerfish study samples were also taken from the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean Sea. Whiting appears to show the highest level of structuring in the north east Atlantic with samples from Icelandic waters being significantly divergent from samples on the continental shelf.   Just one of the continental shelf haddock samples, the Irish Sea, showed evidence of divergence from the Icelandic samples.   This general lack of divergence between Icelandic and continental shelf haddock is most likely reflective of a combination of relatively recent isolation and large effective population sizes (N e).   Apart from a few significant results (P< 0. 05) continental shelf haddock and whiting conspecific populations tended to show little divergence.   This would also appear to be due primarily to large effective population sizes and a relatively recent isolation.   L. piscatorius showed a total absence of genetic differentiation between all the Atlantic samples which is consistent with the long distance movements associated with this species.   There was however strong evidence of divergence between the Atlantic and Mediterranean anglerfish samples. Comparing the results of the molecular studies presented here with non molecular approaches to determining population structure highlights the importance of combining information from several approaches if a sustainable management plan is to be put in place for commercial species.

40|$|In {{the food}} industry, {{hypochlorite}} {{is used to}} reduce the microbiological load of foodstuffs. Its use may result {{in the formation of}} toxic disinfection byproducts. However it is currently generally accepted that below particular intensities its use does not represent a safety concern even in direct contact with foods. In addition however, the use of hypochlorite in contact with foods should also be considered in the framework of consumer acceptance. The formation of 3 -chlorotyrosine seems a potential analytical target to assess the use of hypochlorite in foods. Firstly, the potency of 3 -chlorotyrosine was evaluated as an indicator for the use of hypochlorite in contact with foods in comparison with the other molecular changes in proteins using casein and whey proteins as a model at various oxidant/protein ratios and at different pHs. Secondly, 3 -chlorotyrosine formation was evaluated in four fish <b>species</b> (<b>whiting,</b> European plaice, gilthead seabream and Atlantic salmon) as a result of hypochlorite dipping. The last set of experiments studied the formation and occurrence of 3 -chlorotyrosine in ready-to-eat (RTE) vegetables on the Belgian market. In addition, the dietary exposure via RTE vegetable consumption for Belgian and Spanish populations, exemplifying Northern European lower RTE vegetable consumption and Mediterranean higher consumption patterns, was estimated. This study has demonstrated, for the first time, that 3 -chlorotyrosine is a potential marker to detect the use of hypochlorite disinfectants in fish fillets and vegetables. The levels of 3 -chlorotyrosine not only depend on the level of hypochlorite used, but also on the pH, the type of protein and its tyrosine content. This study is the very first to assess the dietary exposure of populations to 3 -chlorotyrosine through the consumption of RTE vegetables. Overall, the results indicated that even a small amount of hypochlorite in the washing water can generate relevant concentrations of 3 -chlorotyrosine in the treated vegetable. On the basis of this study, concerns with respect to the impact of the use of hypochlorite on chemical food safety are identified...|$|E

40|$|The ways {{in which}} the {{distributions}} of six <b>species</b> of <b>whiting</b> (Sillaginidae) in the coastal marine waters of south-western Australia are related to the type of substrate (bare sand vs. seagrass), degree of exposure of habitat, water depth and body size have been investigated. Whiting in nearshore waters (< 1. 5 m) were sampled using a fine-meshed seine net, while those in 'shallow' (5 - 15 m) and 'deep' (20 - 35 m) waters of the inner continental shelf were sampled with a trawl net. Shallow nearshore waters are shown to provide nursery habitats for five of the six <b>whiting</b> <b>species.</b> In these waters, Sillaginodes punctata, Sillago burrus, Sillago schomburgkii and Sillago vittata mainly occur in protected areas, while Sillago bassensis predominantly occupies areas that are more exposed to wave and swell activity. The first three of these species also use estuaries as nursery areas. In nearshore waters, whiting were captured almost exclusively over bare sand, rather than in interpersed beds of the seagrass Posidonia spp., presumably reflecting the fact that the dense canopies produced by the wide blades of Posidonia spp. must inhibit penetration by the benthic <b>whiting</b> <b>species.</b> As 0 + S. punctata increase in size, they tend to move offshore during the day and inshore at night. Many mature representatives of S. schomburgkii are present in nearshore areas, whereas the other four species move offshore into inner-shelf waters as they increase in length. Sillago burrus and S. vittata remain in shallow inner-shelf waters, whereas the larger S. bassensis subsequently migrate into deeper inner-shelf waters. Large Sillago bassensis thus co-occurs with Sillago robusta, which is mainly found in those deeper waters, but does not reach as large a size. The larger S. punctata occupy areas near reefs which could not be sampled by trawl netting. There are thus interspecific differences in (i) the times of recruitment of the 0 + age class into nearshore areas, (ii) the types of habitat occupied during juvenile and adult life, and (iii) the degree to which fish move into more offshore waters as they increase in length, and one species is restricted to deeper waters. The resultant partial segregation among habitats of the coastal waters of south-western Australia by different size groups of these relatively abundant <b>whiting</b> <b>species</b> presumably reduces the potential for intra- and interspecific competition amongst these species...|$|R
40|$|The dietary {{compositions}} and breadths of sequential 50 mm {{size classes}} of the six <b>whiting</b> <b>species</b> found in nearshore (< 1. 5 m), shallow inner-shelf (5 to 15 m) and/or deep inner-shelf (20 to 35 m) waters of the lower west coast of Australia were determined. Comparisons between the results of principal components analysis of head and mouth dimensions and the dietary compositions of Sillago bassensis, S. vittata, S. burrus, S. schomburgkii, S. robusta and Sillaginodes punctata suggests that any differences in the dietary composition of similar-sized representatives of different species, when they occur in the same habitat, {{are more likely to}} be due to differences in foraging behaviour than mouth morphology. Classification, ordination and Schoener's overlap indices showed that, in nearshore waters, the juveniles of Sillago bassensis, which colonise relatively exposed areas, have a different diet to those of the smallest representatives of the other <b>whiting</b> <b>species</b> that occupy more sheltered habitats. S, bassensis consumes mainly amphipods, whereas the smaller representatives of S. vittata, S. burrus, S. schomburgkii and Sillaginodes punctata ingest large volumes of copepods, which are typically abundant in protected nearshore waters. Although the mouth dimensions of S. punctata tend to be smaller than those of Sillago schomburgkii, the larger individuals of the former species ingest greater quantities of larger prey, such as crabs and carid shrimps. As S. bassensis, S. vittata and S. burrus increase in size and migrate out into shallow inner-shelf waters, the latter two species tend to concentrate more on benthic prey, while the former species ingests fauna that is more epibenthic. The largest S. bassensis subsequently migrate out into deep inner-shelf waters, where they co-occur with S. robusta, which is restricted to those waters. In these waters, S. bassensis feeds to a far greater extent on large benthic prey, whereas S. robusta consumes a greater quantity of small epibenthic crustaceans, differences that reflect the far larger lengths of the former species in that region. The above data emphasise that the distribution and ontogenetic movements of the six abundant <b>species</b> of <b>whiting</b> play a major role in facilitating a partitioning of food resources amongst these species found in coastal waters of the lower west coast of Australia...|$|R
