50|$|Static gamma motor neurons {{innervate}} static nuclear bag fibers (bag2 fibers), a type {{of nuclear}} bag fiber and nuclear chain fibers. Both of these fiber types {{are part of the}} intrafusal muscle spindle fibers, where the static gamma motor neurons innervate onto. Nuclear chain fibers' nuclei are organized in longitudinal columns, which is where it gets its name from, whereas the nuclear bag fibers' nuclei are clumped in the midsection of the muscle spindle. There is a 2:1 ratio of nuclear chain fibers to nuclear bag fibers. The static gamma motor neurons increase their firing, in response to an increase in magnitude of change in length and controls the <b>static</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the stretch reflex. For this reason, this type of gamma motor neuron is mostly used in the maintenance of postures and slower movements such as lifting a box, rather than activities requiring rapid changes due to rapid change in muscle length.|$|E
40|$|To measure {{force by}} AFM with high {{resolution}} requires accurate calibration of optic – lever detection sensitivity and spring constant. On biological AFM force mode, the coupling {{effects of the}} liquid environment, spot size of laser beam and laser spot location on AFM cantilever backside, must be considered to correlate the static sensitivities from force curves in air and in liquid for calibration. An effective model has been developed first and experimentally elucidated to calibrate the <b>static</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in liquid. The proposed model eliminates inconvenience of <b>static</b> <b>sensitivity</b> calibration in liquid with possible contamination sources. The <b>static</b> <b>sensitivity</b> based on force curve can not be directly applied on dynamic modes. The second part of our work analyzed optimization of the dynamic sensitivity of an AFM vibrating at different flexural modes. We have proposed a calibration method to determine the dynamic sensitivity by the force curve, and further developed amplitude sensitivity as the dynamic sensitivity at tapping frequency to calibrate the spring constant of the cantilever by the thermal method. In contrast to the calibration at normal direction, there are main difficulties for the lateral sensitivity and spring constant of a cantilever. A new friction mode is developed in the third part to bypass the difficulties and directly measure friction force or friction coefficient instead, by applying a special T–shape cantilever. An effective method has been proposed to minimize possible errors with this friction mode. We also demonstrate the validation of the mode to distinguish hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups at nanoscale...|$|E

40|$|Standard {{tools for}} CAD have limited modes of the {{sensitivity}} analysis: PSPICE only contains a static mode and SPECTRE includes frequency-domain and static modes. However, many RF systems use symmetrical structures for enhancing the circuit properties. For such systems, the <b>static</b> <b>sensitivities</b> are zero on principle {{and hence the}} time-domain sensitivity analysis should be used. In the paper, a novel recurrent formula for the time/domain sensitivity analysis is derived which uses by-products of an efficient implicit integration algorithm. As the selected integration algorithm is more flexible than the Gear's one that is ordinary used, the sensitivity analysis is more efficient {{in comparison with the}} standard CAD tools.

40|$|Electrostatic sensors are key {{components}} of electrostatic monitoring systems. Their sensitivity characteristics have a direct influence on monitoring accuracy. In previous studies, spatial sensitivity, which is called <b>static</b> <b>sensitivity</b> here, was {{used to describe the}} sensitivity characteristics. However, it only reflects a basic relationship between static charged particles and induced charges on an electrostatic sensor’s probe. Besides, as a three-dimensional defined parameter, it is difficult to build a unified model if actual boundary conditions are considered. Thus, it is not quite proper for applications that detect moving particles. To solve this problem, dynamic sensitivity is proposed in this article. As for a hemisphere-shaped electrostatic sensor, first, a more accurate model of <b>static</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is built. Based on it, dynamic sensitivity is defined and modeled analytically. Then, a calibration method is proposed to improve the model’s accuracy under actual boundary conditions. In the end, finite element method simulations are done for validations. The results demonstrate that dynamic sensitivity reflects a relationship between moving charged particles and the actual output signals of a sensor, thus it is direct and practical for moving particles. And the theoretical results are highly consistent with the simulated ones. Moreover, the dynamic sensitivity indicates localized sensing characteristics of hemisphere-shaped electrostatic sensors...|$|E

40|$|The first fiber Bragg grating (FBG) {{accelerometer}} using direct transverse {{forces is}} demonstrated by fixing the FBG by its two ends and placing a transversely moving inertial object at its middle. It is very sensitive because a lightly stretched FBG is more sensitive to transverse forces than axial forces. Its resonant frequency and <b>static</b> <b>sensitivity</b> are analyzed by the classic spring-mass theory, assuming the axial force changes little. The experiments show that the theory can be modified for cases where the assumption does not hold. The resonant frequency can be modified by a linear relationship experimentally achieved, and the <b>static</b> <b>sensitivity</b> by an alternative method proposed. The principles of the over-range protection and low cross axial sensitivity are achieved by limiting {{the movement of the}} FBG and were validated experimentally.

This paper deals with the 2 CH 101 computer used in the Central Fire Station System as installed in the U. S. Army Air Force's heavy bomber, type B- 29. Essentially, the computer consists of six servomechanisms which position gears, "waggle sticks", and finally four differential syncho-generators, the latter modifying signals sent from the sighting station for ballistic and land corrections developed within the computer and transmitting resultant gun orders to the firing station. In their report the authors have presented results of detailed tests on three of the servomechanism channels, the Range Input Channel, the Azimuth Input channel, and the Elevation Input channel. Tests were made from a transfer function viewpoint. Certain <b>static</b> <b>sensitivities</b> were measured. The Altitude and Airspeed Input channel and the Azimuth and Elevation-Total Correction channels were not tested in through detail since certain essential units of the system were not available. However, other pertinent information on these channels is presented insofar as experimental determination was possible. Briefly, the chief results and conclusions may be listed as follows: (1) The servomechanism channels are properly damped and stable but have a rather low resonant frequency; (2) maximum speed of follow-up in these channels, as listed by the driving motors, is too slow to handle modern, high-velocity problems; (3) solution time is relatively long, and is approximately proportional to the amount of total correction required; (4) the overall computer performance is limited by the connector or discontinuous type of servomechanism used. These function as proportional type servos, and as such have steady state velocity errors. [URL] Navy (U. S. N.) authors...|$|R
