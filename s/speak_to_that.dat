500|$|Following {{several months}} of rumours {{regarding}} the restaurant, the Berkeley Hotel confirmed in May 2008 {{that it was going}} to work with Wareing to launch his only solo restaurant, and he would take on Pétrus' lease from 19 September 2008 onwards. Wareing had previously complained of interference in the kitchen by GRH, and wanted to come out from under Ramsay's shadow, but later admitted that he had engineered the situation so that he could go out on his own. The split with Ramsay and GRH resulted in a public legal battle and feud between the three parties, which when resolved resulted in Wareing stating in an interview for Waitrose Food Illustrated magazine that Ramsay left him bitter and conflicted; [...] "half of me thinks he’s a sad bastard and the other half still adores him." [...] He went on to describe Ramsay as a celebrity chef who wasn't involved in the industry anymore. The legal dispute was resolved with Ramsay gaining the rights to the Pétrus name, and Wareing signing a gag order regarding the situation but continuing to open his restaurant Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley. Wareing remarked of the situation, [...] "If I never <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> guy again for the rest of my life, it wouldn't bother me one bit." [...] Ramsay later responded regarding the feud that he wishes Wareing [...] "all the best". Wareing's self-named restaurant won the Best Restaurant in London Award by Harden's guide in 2008 and 2009, was awarded two Michelin stars in 2009, and was named Time Out's restaurant of the year in 2010. The new Pétrus was opened around the corner from the Berkeley Hotel at 1 Kinnerton Street, Knightsbridge. Ramsay later joked, that with Heston Blumenthal also opening his new restaurant nearby, the three of them could [...] "all have a fight in the street at four in the morning".|$|E
6000|$|... "Suzanne, I forbid you to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> woman," [...] {{said the}} Comtesse, sternly, as she placed a {{restraining}} hand upon her daughter's arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you going}} to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> officer?" [...] Chris Gore asked, as he {{detained}} Hardy for an instant by stepping in front of him.|$|E
6000|$|Answ. I have, in general, briefly <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> already, and now, for thy further help, we will {{a little}} enlarge. Wherefore, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A psychic--undeveloped, of course. I {{have thought}} once or twice. Only {{a little while}} ago I was <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> man Chaffery about her." ...|$|R
60|$|Shefford {{walked away}} into the darkness. The whisper filled his soul. Had a word of love ever been <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> girl? Never--not the love which had been on his lips. Fay Larkin's lonely life spoke clearly in her whisper.|$|R
6000|$|In passing {{she stopped}} and said to Imperence, in a whisper of terrible intensity, [...] "If you <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> girl again you shall have--no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Hester!" [...] exclaimed Mrs Foster, in surprise. [...] "I trust, George, that you, a mere midshipman, {{have not}} dared to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> child of--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you make}} {{any attempt to}} <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> boy, I'll put you in with him! What are you doing here, anyhow? Are you a witness?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Starting at the {{unforeseen}} concluding exclamation of the {{so suddenly}} scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, [...] "I am not used <b>to</b> be <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> way, sir; I do {{but less than}} half like it, sir." ...|$|R
50|$|Norms limit {{number of}} times one asks <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> ensure <b>that</b> each speaker is fully heard.|$|R
60|$|OBSERVATION SECOND.--I {{come now}} to the second {{observation}} propounded <b>to</b> be <b>spoken</b> <b>to,</b> <b>to</b> wit, <b>That</b> they <b>that</b> are coming <b>to</b> Jesus Christ, are ofttimes heartily afraid that Jesus Christ will not receive them.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must never}} <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> old man again. He is a mad old man, {{and he wants}} to kill me. Never speak to him or listen to him again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will never}} willingly <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> man again," [...] said Lord Fawn. But {{as it was}} not {{probable}} that Greystock would greatly desire any further conversation with Lord Fawn, this threat did not carry with it any powerful feeling of severity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait {{here for}} me," [...] said I, rising; [...] "I must <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> man. Had you no answer for him? Because {{you are a}} fool must you die like a mouse under his foot? Could you not utter one squeak in your own defence? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stranger,' he said, 'I {{want you}} <b>to</b> {{understand}} <b>that</b> any one who <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> young woman {{has got to}} talk with me. I am Wyoming Bill, I am. I have set my mind on her, {{and it will be}} safer to tread in a nest of rattlesnakes than to get my dander up.' ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{this was}} very soothing. Here was a gentleman of a great, not to say a grand, address, {{accustomed}} to rank and dignity, really setting a fine example how to behave to a Mayor. There was something in that third-person style of being <b>spoken</b> <b>to,</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Sapsea found particularly recognisant of his merits and position.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{go first}} into Kensington Gardens, Netta; he often {{went there to}} play, and if he came down into the main road, he would very likely wander in. It is {{probable}} that nurse may have been longer <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> man than she thinks, {{and that he had}} time to get a good way before she missed him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shameless, cold-hearted, stuck-up, nasty thing!" [...] said 'Manda Grier, varying her {{denunciation}} in the repetition, {{and apparently}} getting fresh satisfaction {{out of it}} in that way. [...] "Don't? St'ira Dudley, if you was a woman--if you was half a woman--you'd never <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> little corpse-on-ice again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, Padre, I don't {{know what}} will happen. But I know {{that as long as}} I am here Don Carlos can <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> macaque, Pedrito Montero, and {{threaten}} the destruction of the mine with perfect assurance that he will be taken seriously. For people know me." ...|$|E
60|$|THIRD. I {{should now}} come to the second conclusion, viz., {{that this can be}} done by no other righteousness than that long ago {{performed}} by, and remaining with, the person of Christ. But before I <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> I will a little further press this, by urging for it several reasons.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{listening}} to the buyer is to gain as much knowledge as possible about their objection. Showing interest can also show them <b>that</b> you want <b>to</b> know their concerns {{in order to help}} them. Do not interrupt the buyer while they are <b>speaking</b> <b>to.</b> <b>That</b> can quickly close the deal and result in a loss of the sale.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are, I think, {{very few}} {{men in this}} country who would have <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> man or Dom Clemente as you have done," [...] he said. Then he grinned in a very suggestive fashion. [...] "It is {{probably}} fortunate <b>that</b> he seemed <b>to</b> believe you, though if he had been any other man I would have called him very foolish." ...|$|R
5000|$|Much less can human works, {{which are}} done {{over and over}} again with the aid of natural precepts, so <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> lead <b>to</b> <b>that</b> end.|$|R
6000|$|Winterbourne {{perceived}} at {{some distance}} {{a little man}} standing with folded arms nursing his cane. He had a handsome face, an artfully poised hat, a glass in one eye, and a nosegay in his buttonhole. Winterbourne looked at him {{a moment and then}} said, [...] "Do you mean to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> man?" ...|$|E
60|$|He did not however {{allow himself}} {{a moment to}} pause. On the contrary, he walked so quick, that when {{he found himself in}} Miss Baker's drawing-room, he was almost out of breath, and partly from that cause, and partly from his agitation, was unable to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> lady in his usual unruffled manner.|$|E
6000|$|Jude hastened on, {{and soon}} had the {{pleasure}} of observing a man in a black coat and a black slouched felt hat no considerable distance ahead. Stretching out his legs yet more widely he stalked after. [...] "A hungry soul in pursuit of a full soul!" [...] he said. [...] "I must <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> man!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What do you advise, Mr Carker?' said Walter, smiling. 'You {{always give}} me good advice, you know, {{when you do}} <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me. <b>That's</b> not often, though.' ...|$|R
60|$|Third. And now I come to {{the third}} thing that I told you I should <b>speak</b> <b>to,</b> and <b>that</b> is, <b>to</b> those inferences <b>that</b> may be {{gathered}} from these words.|$|R
6000|$|... [31]Now then, {{from what}} hath been said, there might many things be spoken {{by way of}} use and application; but I shall be very brief, and but touch some things, and so wind up. And, First, I shall begin with the sad {{condition}} of those that die out of Christ, and <b>speak</b> something <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> Secondly, <b>To</b> the latter end of the parable, which more evidently concerns the Scripture, and <b>speak</b> somewhat <b>to</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She took it, {{and pressed}} it gently. [...] "I should have been {{glad to see you}} at any time," [...] she said. [...] "You don't know how glad I am to see you now. May I trouble you to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> man? He has been {{following}} me, and annoying me {{all the way from the}} town." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next morning}} {{they went down}} with Roberts to Gravesend, to engage a large and roomy boat with two watermen for their trip. Just as they were {{entering}} Hyde Park Gardens, on their return, a man passed them. Roberts looked hard at him, and then said, [...] "If you don't want me any more now, miss, I should like to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> man; he is an old fellow-soldier." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So much so, that I {{was just}} on my way there with Campbell. But I must just <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> lime-burning fellow. He wants a new lease of the kiln, and I suppose he must have it. At least, here he comes, running at me open-mouthed, and as dry as his own waistband. It makes one thirsty to look at him. I'll catch you up in five minutes!" ...|$|E
60|$|I might enlarge {{upon these}} things, but shall leave {{them to the}} Spirit of the Lord, which can better by ten {{thousand}} degrees enlarge them on thy heart and conscience, than I can upon a piece of paper. Therefore, leaving these to {{the blessing of the}} Lord, I shall come to the next verse, and shall be brief in <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> also, and so pass to the rest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you {{addressing}} me, sir? I {{would have}} you know that am not accustomed <b>to</b> be <b>spoken</b> <b>to,</b> in <b>that</b> fashion; and that I bear an insult from no one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, poor dear Dr. Trefoil!" [...] {{said the}} countess, {{who had once}} in her life <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> gentleman. [...] "I was so distressed to hear it, Mrs. Proudie. And so Dr. Stanhope {{is to be the}} new dean! He comes of an {{excellent}} family, and I wish him success in spite of his daughter. Perhaps, Mrs. Proudie, when he is dean, they'll be better able to see the error of their ways." ...|$|R
