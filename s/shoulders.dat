The incidence, etiology, pathology and prognostic factors of postoperative frozen <b>shoulder</b> after <b>shoulder</b> surgery are not known. The purpose of this explorative study was to determine the incidence of postoperative frozen <b>shoulder</b> after various operative <b>shoulder</b> procedures. A second aim was to identify prognostic factors for postoperative frozen <b>shoulder</b> after <b>shoulder</b> surgery. 505 consecutive patients undergoing elective <b>shoulder</b> surgery were included in this prospective cohort study. Follow-up was 6 months after surgery. A prediction model was developed to identify prognostic factors for postoperative frozen <b>shoulder</b> after <b>shoulder</b> surgery using the TRIPOD guidelines. We nominated five potential predictors: gender, diabetes mellitus, type of physiotherapy, arthroscopic surgery and DASH score. Frozen <b>shoulder</b> was identified in 11 % of the patients after <b>shoulder</b> surgery and was more common in females (15 %) than in males (8 %).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the differences of body compensation image on variations in the <b>shoulder</b> height and width of power <b>shoulder</b> raglan sleeve jacket. Nine samples were examined: 3 variations of the <b>shoulder</b> height and 3 variations of the <b>shoulder</b> width. The data was evaluated by 123 fashion design majors. The results were as follows; as a result of analyzing the body compensation image according to changes in the <b>shoulder</b> height and width of power <b>shoulder</b> raglan sleeve jacket, five factors were selected; the <b>shoulder</b> compensation factor, the bust compensation factor, the waist compensation factor, the arm compensation factor and the neck compensation factor. Among these factors, the <b>shoulder</b> compensation factor is the most important factor. Examining the major effect of the body compensation image based on changes in the <b>shoulder</b> height and width of power <b>shoulder</b> raglan sleeve jacket, it had an independent influence on factors about waist, neck, <b>shoulder</b> and arm compensation except a factor about bust compensation, had an influence on interacting effect of factors about <b>shoulder,</b> bust, waist, arm compensation, and it had no influence on interacting effect of a factor about neck compensation.

40|$|In rugby union {{football}} {{the tackle}} {{is the most}} frequently executed skill and one most associated with injury, including <b>shoulder</b> injury to the tackler. Despite {{the importance of the}} tackle, {{little is known about the}} magnitude of <b>shoulder</b> forces in the tackle and influencing factors. The objectives of the study were to measure the <b>shoulder</b> force in the tackle, as well as the effects of <b>shoulder</b> padding, skill level, side of body, player size, and experimental setting on <b>shoulder</b> force. Experiments were conducted in laboratory and field settings using a repeated measures design. Thirty-five participants were recruited to the laboratory and 98 to the field setting. All were male aged over 18 years with rugby experience. The maximum force applied to the <b>shoulder</b> in an active <b>shoulder</b> tackle was measured with a custom built forceplate incorporated into a 45 kg tackle bag. The overall average maximum <b>shoulder</b> force was 1660 N in the laboratory and 1997 N in the field. This difference was significant. The <b>shoulder</b> force for tackling without <b>shoulder</b> pads was 1684 N compared to 1635 N with <b>shoulder</b> pads. There was no difference between the <b>shoulder</b> forces on the dominant and non-dominant sides. <b>Shoulder</b> force reduced with tackle repetition. No relationship was observed between player skill level and size. A substantial force can be applied to the <b>shoulder</b> and to an opponent in the tackle.

Methods:This cross-sectional feasibility study included six healthy adult men with no impairment in <b>shoulder</b> motion. The single-joint HAL was fixed to a custom-designed platform and upper arm attachment, and aligned 3 cm below the acromion process. Vital signs, <b>shoulder</b> fatigue, and <b>shoulder</b> pain were evaluated before and after the <b>shoulder</b> elevation exercise performed with and without the HAL. Activity of selected muscles of the <b>shoulder</b> was recorded using a wireless superficial electromyography device. <b>Shoulder</b> movement was captured using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. Results:The HAL supported smooth flexion-extension of the arm at the <b>shoulder</b> joint, with no negative effects on vital signs, <b>shoulder</b> fatigue, and <b>shoulder</b> pain. The HAL decreased muscle activity levels, with a 55 % decrease in trapezius muscle activity.
