25|$|NaV1.5 is an {{integral}} membrane protein and tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium channel subunit. NaV1.5 is found primarily in cardiac muscle, where it mediates the fast influx of Na+-ions (INa) across the cell membrane, resulting in the fast depolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. As such, it {{plays a major role}} in impulse propagation through the heart. A vast number of cardiac diseases is associated with mutations in NaV1.5 (<b>see</b> <b>paragraph</b> genetics). SCN5A is the gene that encodes the cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5.|$|E
25|$|Olea europaea is very hardy: drought-, disease- and fire-resistant, it {{can live}} {{to a great}} age. Its root system is robust and capable of {{regenerating}} the tree even if the above-ground structure is destroyed. The older the olive tree, the broader and more gnarled the trunk becomes. Many olive trees in the groves around the Mediterranean {{are said to be}} hundreds of years old, while an age of 2,000 years is claimed for a number of individual trees; in some cases, this has been scientifically verified. <b>See</b> <b>paragraph</b> dealing with the topic.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1997/98 {{series against}} Australia, Srinath's with one {{particular}} delivery measured at 149.6km/h. [...] The Zimbabwe captain Alistair Campbell revealed that Srinath was recorded at 157km/hr on 27 January 1997 {{in the game}} at Paarl between India and Zimbabwe. He said about this game: [...] "We {{then moved on to}} our second game against India, at Boland Bank Park. In all 236 was quite a decent score, as it wasn't the easiest of pitches to bat on, and Srinath I think bowled the quickest that any of our guys had ever seen. He bowled a really quick spell early on, even quicker than Allan Donald; he was timed at 157 km/h, a good 10 km/h faster than Donald was bowling throughout the tournament. Grant Flower was hit on the thigh pad, and when he came off he said he thought he had broken his leg". (<b>See</b> <b>paragraph</b> 7 of the article by clicking on the below link).|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} which the young king accomplished while he was alive was the construction of his own tomb. In 215 BC Qin Shi Huang ordered General Meng Tian to begin its construction {{with the assistance of}} 300,000 men. Other sources suggest that he ordered 720,000 unpaid laborers to build his tomb according to his specifications. Again, given John Man's observation regarding populations at the time (<b>see</b> <b>paragraph</b> above), these historical estimates are debatable. The main tomb (located at [...] ) containing the emperor has yet to be opened and there is evidence suggesting that it remains relatively intact. Sima Qian's description of the tomb includes replicas of palaces and scenic towers, [...] "rare utensils and wonderful objects", 100 rivers made with mercury, representations of [...] "the heavenly bodies", and crossbows rigged to shoot anyone who tried to break in. The tomb was built at the foot of Mount Li, 30 kilometers away from Xi'an. Modern archaeologists have located the tomb, and have inserted probes deep into it. The probes revealed abnormally high quantities of mercury, some 100 times the naturally occurring rate, suggesting that some parts of the legend are credible. Secrets were maintained, as most of the workmen who built the tomb were killed.|$|E
