40|$|The {{water quality}} {{behaviour}} of 58 <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> in Winnipeg, Canada, was intensively studied during a 5 -month summer period (May to September). Dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, turbidity, transparency and depth were measured onsite. Samples analyzed {{in the laboratory}} included: total suspended solids (TSS), pH, chlorophyll a, fecal coliforms (FC), total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia, nitrate, total phosphorus (TP) and orthophosphate. Results showed that increases in TSS and turbidity resulted from increased chlorophyll a concentrations associated with algal growth. TKN increases were partly the result of nitrogen incorporation into proteinaceous material in the algal cells. Ammonia concentrations showed a maximum attributed to chemo-heterotrophic degradation of dead biomass. Orthophosphate made up 30 % to 50 % of the total phosphorus present and the two followed the same general trends. Temperature increased and then decreased over the summer months with no apparent thermal stratification. After starting the summer with no dis-solved oxygen gradient between top and bottom, depletion of the dissolved oxygen {{at the bottom of}} the basins during the latter half of the summer was attributed to chemoheterotrophic degradation of dead biomass. Finally, sub-stantial counts of fecal coliform bacteria occurred in the basins in response to Canada geese migration.

40|$|In {{the past}} the quality of {{receiving}} waters has been continuously improved by upgrading measures on both industrial and urban waste water treatment plants (WWTP) and sewer systems. However, latest inventories of sources and pathways of pollutants originating from industrial and domestic use and activities, for example carried out for the river Rhine catchment, {{emphasize the importance of}} diffuse nonpoint pollution on water quality in urbanized river catchments in comparison to the loads of point sources form industrial or urban WWTPs, for which a reduction on about 70 % of the status of 1985 was considered in 1995. In order to obtain detailed information on the fate of heavy metals in river catchments, this study was carried out mainly to collect representative literature about possible diffuse nonpoint pollution sources, to monitor concentration of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Hg, Ni and Zn) in stormwater overflows and to assess these loads discharged into receiving waters. An extensive literature survey was carried out resulting in a database containing 121 references with more than 2100 values especially about the pollution sources FARMING and URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE. The database was adapted to the register on diffuse nonpoint pollution of the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine (ICPR). While only a few references on diffuse nonpoint pollution sources were evaluated for Hg, Cr and Ni and the pathways within the urban drainage systems (e. g. effluents of <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> <b>basins,</b> combined sewer overflows) a remarkable number of references could be collected for the other heavy metals and diffuse sources and pathways respectively. Due to the lack of precise data on {{the current state of the}} art of stormwater treatment in Germany a field study was carried out in Herrenberg. Objects of the investigation were two different <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> (SRB) at two well defined catchments. In the field study about nine events of stormwater overflows at SRB 1 and eleven events at SRB 2 were sampled. The results (event mean concentration) indicate a high level but match the values of the evaluated references. However, specific heavy metal pollution loads referring to the impervious catchment area show high values in particular SRB 1 with its urbanized hinterland. Based on the evaluated literature database and observed EMCs in stormwater overflows a semi-empirical model has been developed to assess heavy metal loads in receiving waters from considered pollution sources.

40|$|<b>Stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> are an {{integral}} component of municipal stormwater management strategies in North America. The province of Ontario’s Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change obligates land developers to implement stormwater management in their land use and development plans to mitigate the effects of urbanization (Bradford and Gharabaghi, 2004). When <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> ponds are improperly designed or maintained, these basins can fail at improving effluent water quality and may exasperate water quality issues. Intense H 2 S production events in stormwater infrastructure {{is a serious problem}} which is seldom encountered and documented in <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> ponds. This study monitored two <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> ponds situated in the Riverside South community, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada for a period of 15 consecutive months to thoroughly characterize intense hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) production in a <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> pond under ice covered conditions during winter operation and during periods of drought under non-ice covered conditions during the summer. Field experiments showed a strong relationship (p 0. 58, n = 20 +) between hypoxic conditions (dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration < 2 mg/L) and the intense production of H 2 S gas. Ice-capping of the stormwater ponds during winter severely hindered reaeration of the pond and led to significant production of total sulfides in the Riverside South Pond # 2 (RSP 2), which subsequently resulted in the accumulation of total sulfides in the water column (20. 7 mg/L) during winter in this pond. There was a perceived lag phase between the drop in DO and the increase in total sulfides near the surface, which was potentially indicative of slow movement of total sulfides from the benthic sediment into the water column. These high-sulfide conditions persisted in RSP 2 from early January 2015 until the spring thaw, in mid-April, 2015. Riverside South Pond # 1 (RSP 1), the reference pond studied in this work, showed significantly less production of total sulfides across a significantly shorter period of time. Analysis of the microbial communities showed that there was little change in the dominant bacterial populations present in the benthic sediment of the pond demonstrating significant total sulfide production (RSP 2) and the pond that did not demonstrate significant total sulfide production (RSP 1). Additionally, it was found that locations with the most accumulated sediment had the highest propensity for the production of H 2 S gas. Furthermore, there was no perceivable community shift in the two ponds throughout the seasons, indicating that the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in stormwater benthic sediment are ubiquitous, exist in an acclimatized microbial population and are robust.

Therefore, it is important to identify the sources of Hg pollution in the aquatic environment and to develop effective strategies for reducing the input into associated river systems. The aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze Hg in the urban water cycle of the city of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Samples were taken from the river Main crosscutting the city and its tributaries. In addition, precipitation, stormwater runoff, effluents of two municipal WWTPs, and stormwater management structures such as combined sewer overflows and <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> have been analyzed. Loads of Hg have been determined based on the measured concentrations and a Hg mass balance for the aquatic system was created. A total of 160 water samples were analyzed by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (CVAFS) according to US EPA Method 1631. Results from the mass balance have shown that approximately 5 kg Hg/a enter and 15 kg Hg/a leave the study area of Frankfurt am Main via the river Main. The largest amount of Hg (24. 58 kg/a) throughout the urban water cycle of Frankfurt am Main is transported via wastewater. However, municipal WWTPs in Frankfurt am Main have been identified as the largest Hg sink, since 99. 7 % (24. 5 kg/a) of the Hg is shifted from the sewage water and stormwater during treatment into the sewage sludge. Thus, the increase of the Hg load in the river Main from 5 to 15 kg/a has to be attributed to other sources such as 3 industrial WWTPs, groundwater and non-treated stormwater runoff during heavy rain events...|$|R

40|$|Urbanization {{and climate}} change trends put strong {{pressures}} on urban water systems. Temporal variations in rainfall, runoff and water availability increase, {{and need to be}} compensated by innovative adaptation strategies. One of these is storm water retention and infiltration in open and/or green spaces in the city (blue – green water integration). This study evaluated the efficiency of three adaptation strategies for the city of Turnhout in Belgium, namely source control as a result of blue–green water integration, <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> located downstream of the stormwater sewers, and end-of-pipe solutions based on river flood control reservoirs. The efficiency of these options is quantified by the reduction in sewer and river flood frequencies and volumes, and sewer overflow volumes. This is done by means of long-term simulations (100 -year rainfall simulations) using an integrated conceptual sewer-river model calibrated to full hydrodynamic sewer and river models. Results show that combining open, green zones in the city with <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> and infiltration for only 1 % of the total city runoff area would lead to a 30 to 50 % reduction in sewer flood volumes for return periods in the range 10 – 100 years. This is due to the additional surface storage and infiltration and consequent reduction in urban runoff. However, the impact of this source control option on downstream river floods is limited. <b>Stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> downstream of the sewer system gives a strong reduction in peak discharges to the receiving river. However due to the difference in response time between the sewer and river systems, this does not lead to a strong reduction in river flood frequency.

40|$|While {{green roof}} (GR) systems have gained {{popularity}} as storm water management tools, more emphasis {{has been applied}} to studying performance aspects, including <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention.</b> Of particular importance is the substrate layer in which the vegetation grows, which contributes the majority of <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> capabilities. This research investigated many aspects of GR substrate performance, including component durability and component effects on hydraulic conductivity, matric potential, and plant growth. Several commercial substrate blends were tested for durability against successive freeze/thaw cycles with before and after-treatment granulometric distribution analyses. All substrate blends showed significant (p< 0. 05) particle degradation after 30 freeze-thaw cycles, compared to German (FLL) guidelines. The hydraulic conductivity and matric potential of three experimental GR substrates with increasing volumetric proportions (10 %, 20 %, 40 %) of organic matter (OM), were determined using the HYPROP© method, which extends the traditional measurement range for soils. However, the high porosity of GR substrates resulted in tensiometer water column cavitation near - 30 kPa. Further studies with the same experimental substrates and OM ratios included both growth chamber studies to rigorously quantify the effects on plant growth and evapotranspiration and outdoor platform experiments to determine effects of OM content on <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention.</b> Growth chamber studies with Sedum kamptschaticum showed that increasing substrate OM increased plant root and shoot biomass. Consecutive periods of water stress showed no differences in evapotranspiration between planted substrate OM treatments levels, but greater water loss was noted from the planted treatments compared to unplanted controls (p< 0. 05). Substrate volumetric water content (VWC) during the stress periods reached 5 % VWC for all planted treatments and all dry-down periods, highlighting differences in plant-available water between these and the laboratory results. While outdoor platform studies showed no effects of OM content on <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention,</b> increasing organic content increased plant canopy coverage (p< 0. 05). It is likely that differences in retention will be more defined over time as the system matures. <b>Stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> data represented the second growing season for the experimental platforms; given the effects of organic matter on plant growth, analysis of three- or even five-year retention will likely better predict the effects of organic matter on stormwater performance...|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the potential effect of climate changes on the quality of stormwater runoff and on the treatment efficiency of a <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> pond in Denmark by applying an integrated stormwater quality model for long term simulations with a realistic climate change scenario as input. The analysis focused on total suspended solids (TSS), and copper (total and dissolved Cu) loads and concentrations in runoff from a catchment as well as in the outlet of a <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> pond. These were selected among a wider range of stormwater priority pollutants as indicators of physical pollutants and micropollutants (MP) that can potentially be removed via settling. TSS is closely associated with immediate as well as accumulated aesthetic and environmental effects. Cu is ubiquitous in stormwater runoff and available in both dissolved and particulate phases, where especially the dissolved phase causes acute toxicity to aquatic life (Eriksson et al. 2007; Ingvertsen et al. 2011) and therefore is regulated (European Commission 2000, 2008). The stormwater pollutant fluxes were estimated by using the integrated dynamic stormwater quality model presented by Vezzaro et al. (2012 a). The potential effect of climate changes on the rainfall pattern and consequently on the stormwater runoff quality and treatment efficiency of <b>stormwater</b> <b>retention</b> ponds was evaluated by applying two 100 -year synthetic rain series, where one represented the current climate conditions and the other represented the climatic conditions expected 100  years into the future.|$|R
