25|$|According to Rebecca Xavier, {{members of}} the Willford family, and others, {{there is a strong}} family {{tradition}} amongst Campbell's descendants that she was very well treated by the Lenape, that she was sad to be separated from them, and that the Lenape were <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her go.|$|E

The other children ignore it, but Clara immediately takes a liking to it. Fritz, however, breaks it. Clara is heartbroken.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, the Doctor {{began to}} enjoy his travels through time and space, taking people {{along for the}} ride and was always {{reluctant}} and <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them go, even when he knew it was for their own good. The Doctor's personality mellowed {{around the time of the}} serial Marco Polo, and he evolved into the more familiar grandfatherly figure that children loved.|$|E

The chill of that icy water had done great harm, {{and there was}} much {{inflammation}} at first, leaving such oppression of breath that permanent injury to the lungs was expected, and therefore {{it was all the}} <b>sadder</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the dumb despair with which she returned to understanding, I can hardly say to memory, for I believe she had never lost it for a moment.|$|R
50|$|After the {{war ended}} in August 1945, there were doubts {{as to whether the}} Los Alamos Laboratory would remain, not to mention the Santa Fe office. Now McKibbin was {{arranging}} people's departures. No one was <b>sadder</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Oppenheimer depart on October 16, 1945. His successor, Norris Bradbury, agreed to take over the director's position for six months. He would remain for 25 years. He kept the laboratory open, and retained the Santa Fe office open, with McKibbin as its head.|$|R
25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} not {{completed}} {{at the time}} of Jordan's death on September 16, 2007.

But I would be far more distressed to leave it unfinished, incomplete and dangling forever." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{simultaneous}} {{review of the}} shows in Fox's Animation Domination block, Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club praised the episode for having [...] "some actual plot and continuity". She concluded her review, writing: [...] "Jillian has been a pretty good addition to the Family Guy universe, and I think I'm actually <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her and Brian break up." [...] She graded the episode B+, the second-highest grade of the night. Ahsan Haque of IGN wrote that the episode [...] "managed to rise about the generic plotline and deliver a pretty solid half-hour of entertainment that told a cohesive (and somewhat sad) main story, with just enough gags {{to fill in the}} rest of the time." [...] Haque graded the episode 7.8 out of 10, and wrote that it was [...] "definitely <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the end of the Brian and Jillian relationship, especially considering the great performance put on by Drew Barrymore." [...] Brad Trechak of TV Squad called it [...] "a fairly pedestrian episode with a few cute gags".|$|E

[...] According to Douglas, [...] "five seconds later Harvey [...] (producer) says from video village, 'you can't say dicks on TV'. We had to do it again.

It was doing Trescothick and his family no good at all. Representing your country is a source of huge pride, but there are far more important things in life". Fraser also wrote: [...] "It was in Pakistan that Marcus Trescothick's mental illness began to stir and the opener has not played an overseas test since".|$|E
500|$|With {{the episode}} {{exploring}} the new clairvoyant abilities of Negga's Raina, executive producer Maurissa Tancharoen noted {{the irony of}} this, as Raina {{had spent much of}} her time on the series obsessed with another character who she believed was clairvoyant. On the death of his character in the episode, Kassianides said, [...] "I'm <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him go, [...] I'm happy to see someone like that get their comeuppance". Noting that the character was originally intended to be killed off in [...] "A Hen in the Wolf House", Kassianides felt that the way Bakshi and his relationships had developed throughout the season was [...] "fantastic" [...] and made the character's final sacrifice a much more [...] "beautiful" [...] death.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the episode}} [...] "Counterfeit", Gutierrez wrote that [...] "...despite {{the fact that}} the having an exact twin of Tessa's pop up is flatly ludicrous, it plays out due to MacLeod's desire to have Tessa back {{overriding}} his sense of reason. (...) Vandernoot likes the Tessa character quite a bit and gave me the impression she was <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her go," [...] and that she [...] "...looks like she enjoys playing the good/bad Lisa. Her triple performance as Tessa shows Vandernoot's range." [...] Kathie Huddleston of Scifi.com felt that [...] "...a visit from Tessa in [...] "Counterfeit", even an evil Tessa look-alike, is a welcome nod to a significant character from the first season, and it gave our boy Duncan a moment or two to reflect on his recent lost love." ...|$|E

500|$|Barrymore's alcohol {{dependence}} meant most studios {{were unwilling to}} employ him, but MGM risked casting him {{in the role of}} Mercutio in their 1936 film Romeo and Juliet. To minimize disruption to the schedule, the studio put Barrymore in Kelley's Rest Home, a sanatorium for alcoholics, but he continued to drink covertly and was disruptive on set. Basil Rathbone, who was playing Tybalt, later recounted that [...] "he was drinking and unreliable on the set... It was <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him in such a state." [...] Opinions on his portrayal were divided. Some critics, such as Welford Beaton of the Hollywood Spectator, thought [...] "Barrymore is an acting gem", although Gielgud was uncomplimentary, writing to Peggy Ashcroft that [...] "Barrymore, who is like a monstrous old male impersonator jumping through a hoop, should really have been shot." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, it was {{reported}} that Wellard was to be killed off. A show insider explained: [...] "Wellard has been a much-loved character and everyone will be <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him go. But if you think about it, Wellard was not a puppy when he arrived on Albert Square, so he would be over 100 in dog years by now. It makes sense for him to bow out of the show gracefully." [...] Raddings commented: [...] "I used to take Kyte on set everyday but I found the scenes when Wellard was put down too hard to watch so I asked someone else to take her to filming." [...] The scene in which Wellard was euthanised had to be re-edited, as Kyte could be seen breathing when supposedly dead. At the time of his death, Wellard had been in EastEnders for 14 years, making him one of the show's longest-running characters, and its longest-serving pet.|$|E
500|$|Brett Love of TV Squad {{posited that}} Gordon's {{return in the}} [...] "great" [...] episode was [...] "well worth the wait". He noted that the revelation that Lucy was just an {{innocent}} girl was a [...] "nice twist", and deemed it a [...] "great choice" [...] to have Gordon turned into a vampire. Love was <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Gordon depart from the series, finding the [...] "outstanding" [...] Brown to be [...] "so intense and committed" [...] to the role. However, he considered Bela's appearance to be unnecessary, and pointed out the implausibility of it being easier for Gordon to track down Bela {{than it would have}} been to just track down the Winchesters. Like Love, Julie Pyle of Airlock Alpha believed Bela's appearance [...] " [...] forced". She was saddened by the deaths of Gordon and Kubrick, and had hoped that their storylines would have been further explored. Pyle also criticized the episode's lighting, commenting, [...] "With the added gore this season, the show should seem darker. Instead, it's like Supernatural Lite." [...] While Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune found the concept of Gordon hunting down Sam to be [...] "inspired", she noted that [...] "'Fresh Blood' didn't do much for [...] ".|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Blair {{expressed}} {{frustration that}} Carmella {{had become a}} [...] "very tortured, depressive character {{and there was no}} {{light at the end of}} the tunnel." [...] She described the role, which went through enormous transformations, as being one that had pushed her acting abilities. Blair's pleas to the show producers to let the down-on-luck Carmella be up-beat again were rejected. In June 2008, the actress confirmed her plans to leave the series when her contract expired. Speaking of her decision to leave, Blair said: [...] "I made the decision in December [...] I am eager to try new things and go to a place where people have no idea what I have done, I want to experiment with what works for me and what doesn't as a performer." [...] Producers confirmed they did not intend to kill her character off, as they hoped for her to return again in the future. A spokesperson for the programme's broadcaster, Network Ten, stated: [...] "Obviously, we've loved having Natalie on the show all these years and we're really <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her go [...] and hope to see her on Ramsay Street again one day in the future." [...] Blair later admitted she was surprised at her rise popularity whilst playing Carmella.|$|E
500|$|Rosie O'Donnell reacted {{negatively}} to Fink's casting and first solo musical performance. In {{an interview with}} Access Hollywood, she deemed her rendition of [...] "I Know What Boys Like" [...] underwhelming, and stated that it failed to meet her expectations. She called Lauren [...] "so unlikable," [...] and questioned why the producers had not cast a [...] "pretty heavy girl". Fink brushed off O'Donnell's comments. O'Donnell later apologized, and said, [...] "Oh, Ashley â I love your swagger â your acting â your face â your heart â as a famous fat person â I am often asked about the issueâ¦ I love the story line â I love the show â and if in any way something I said hurt you â I apologize MORE. You are so talented, and I can't wait to hear you belt itâ¦as I know you canâthe often misquoted Rosie." [...] Fink was defended by Justin Thompson of Socialite Life, who commented: [...] "I've loved her character and how they've developed her and she's just {{become a source of}} great comedy â is that because she's full-figured? No. Is it because her character is well-written? Yes. Itâs kind of <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Rosie lambaste what the show is trying to do." ...|$|E
500|$|After Cattermole's departure, {{vowing to}} not disband, the {{remaining}} six members stayed {{together under the}} name S Club. Despite losing {{a member of the}} group, the future remained positive as, although they were very <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Cattermole leave the group, they were [...] "delighted" [...] to have extended their contracts meaning they could look forward to new material, a new series of their television show as well as their first feature film. However, media reports of the time weren't so optimistic stating that, as neither the Spice Girls nor Take That had survived once they lost a member of their group, {{it would be difficult for}} S Club to remain together in an industry which has a [...] "horrible habit of leaving bands in tatters once the first member has left". After only peaking at number-five in the UK charts with Alive, their first single as a six, was S Club's positivism diminished. Although their progressive musical style was once again furthered with the release of their fourth studio album, Seeing Double, it failed to make an impact on the UK charts, stalling at number-seventeen. S Club's time at the top of the charts was slowly coming to an end, and when O'Meara announced that she had an immobilising back condition which could have left her in a wheelchair, and she was unable to take part in television performances, the group was left devastated.|$|E
