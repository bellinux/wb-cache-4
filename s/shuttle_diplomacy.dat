25|$|On November 23, 1967, the Secretary General {{appointed}} Gunnar Jarring as Special Envoy {{to negotiate}} {{the implementation of the}} resolution with the parties, the so-called Jarring Mission. The governments of Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon recognized Jarring's appointment and agreed to participate in his <b>shuttle</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> although they differed on key points of interpretation of the resolution. The government of Syria rejected Jarring's mission on grounds that total Israeli withdrawal was a prerequisite for further negotiations. The talks under Jarring's auspices lasted until 1973, but bore no results. After 1973, the Jarring mission was replaced by bilateral and multilateral peace conferences.|$|E

Ford considered it [...] "stalling" [...] and wrote, [...] "Their [...] tactics frustrated the Egyptians and made me mad as hell."

2500|$|During the First Intifada (see Arab–Israeli conflict), Shultz [...] "proposed ... an {{international}} convention in April 1988 ... on an interim autonomy agreement for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, {{to be implemented}} as of October for a three-year period". By December 1988, following six months of <b>shuttle</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> Shultz had established a diplomatic dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which {{was picked up by}} the next Administration.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Shuttle</b> <b>diplomacy</b> {{among the}} estates {{continued}} without success until May 27; on May 28, {{the representatives of}} the 3rd Estate began to meet on their own, calling themselves the Communes ("Commons") and proceeding with their [...] "verification of powers" [...] independently of the other bodies; from June 13 to June 17 they were gradually joined by some of the nobles and the majority of the clergy and other people such as the peasants. On June 13, this group began to call itself the National Assembly.|$|E
2500|$|From March 1897, Fernando Primo de Rivera, 1st Marquis of Estella, the Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines, {{had been}} {{encouraging}} prominent Filipinos to contact Aguinaldo {{for a peaceful}} settlement of the conflict. On August 9, Manila lawyer Pedro Paterno met with Aguinaldo at Biak-na-Bato with a proposal for peace based on reforms and amnesty. In succeeding months, Paterno conducted <b>shuttle</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> acting as an intermediary between de Rivera and Aguinaldo. On December 14–15, 1897 Aguinaldo signed the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, under which Aguinaldo effectively agreed to end hostilities and dissolve his government in exchange for amnesty and [...] "₱800,000 (Mexican)" [...] (Aguinaldo's description of the amount) as an indemnity.|$|E
2500|$|In foreign policy, {{the major}} {{development}} {{at the beginning of}} Rabin's term was the Sinai Interim Agreement between Israel and Egypt, signed on 1 September 1975. Both countries declared that the conflict between them and in the Middle East shall not be resolved by military force but by peaceful means. This agreement followed Henry Kissinger's <b>shuttle</b> <b>diplomacy</b> and a threatened [...] "reassessment" [...] of the United States' regional policy and its relations with Israel. Rabin notes it was [...] "an innocent-sounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in American–Israeli relations." [...] But the agreement was an important step towards the Camp David Accords of 1978 and the peace treaty with Egypt signed in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1982 Haig {{conducted}} <b>shuttle</b> <b>diplomacy</b> {{between the}} governments of Argentina in Buenos Aires and the United Kingdom in London after Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. Negotiations broke down and Haig returned to Washington on April 19. The British fleet then entered the war zone. In December 2012 documents released under the UK [...] "30 Year Rule" [...] disclosed that Haig planned to reveal British classified military information to Argentina {{in advance of the}} recapture of South Georgia. The information, which contained British plans for the retaking of the island, was intended to show the military junta in Buenos Aires that the United States was a neutral player and could be trusted to act impartially during negotiations to end the conflict.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} two years, Hoover worked 14-hour days from London, {{administering}} the distribution of over two million tons of food to nine million war victims. In an early form of <b>shuttle</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> he crossed the North Sea forty times to meet with German authorities and persuade them to allow food shipments, becoming an international hero. The Belgian city of Leuven named a prominent square Hooverplein after him. At its peak, Hoover's American Relief Administration (ARA) fed 10.5 million people daily. Great Britain grew reluctant to support the CRB, preferring instead to emphasize Germany's obligation to supply the relief; Winston Churchill, whom Hoover intensely disliked, led a military faction that considered the Belgian relief effort [...] "a positive military disaster".|$|E
2500|$|In the {{continuing}} Arab–Israeli conflict, although an initial cease fire had been implemented to end active {{conflict in the}} Yom Kippur War, Kissinger's continuing <b>shuttle</b> <b>diplomacy</b> was showing little progress. In 1973, Egypt and Syria had launched a joint surprise attack against Israel, seeking to re-take land lost in the Six-Day War of 1967. However, early Arab success gave way to an Israel military victory, and Ford sought to implement a peace among the belligerents. Ford disliked {{what he saw as}} Israeli [...] "stalling" [...] on a peace agreement, and wrote, [...] "Their [...] tactics frustrated the Egyptians and made me mad as hell." [...] During Kissinger's shuttle to Israel in early March 1975, a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal, prompted a cable from Ford to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, which included: ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 1, 1897, the [...] was signed. By {{the end of}} 1897, Governor-General Primo de Rivera {{accepted}} the impossibility of quelling the revolution by force of arms. In {{a statement to the}} Cortes Generales, he said, [...] "I can take Biak-na-Bato, any military man can take it, but I can not answer that I could crush the rebellion." [...] Desiring to make peace with Aguinaldo, he sent emissaries to Aguinaldo seeking a peaceful settlement. Nothing was accomplished until Pedro A. Paterno, a distinguished lawyer from Manila perhaps wanting a Spanish nobility title, volunteered to act as negotiator. On August 9, 1897, Paterno proposed a peace based on reforms and amnesty to Aguinaldo. In succeeding months, practicing <b>shuttle</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> Paterno traveled back and forth between Manila and Biak-na-Bato carrying proposals and counterproposals. Paterno's efforts led to a peace agreement called the Pact of Biak-na-Bato. This consisted of three documents, the first two being signed on December 14, 1897, and the third being signed on December 15; effectively ending the Republic of Biak-na-Bato.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1511, Forman {{carried a}} letter to Henry in which James complained bitterly that the criminals who had murdered Sir Robert Ker, Warden of the Middle Marches {{in the time of}} his father, Henry VII, were still at large. James stated that he could not accept that his {{subjects}} were being killed and those responsible not being brought to justice. The Scottish king's letter to the pope in December 1511 showed that James regarded that the treaty between Scotland and England was worthless and that he assumed that the pope had released both kings from their oaths to uphold the treaty. [...] James was now in the complex situation where he still had the existing treaty with England and with an alliance with France on the table but each contradictory to the other. He did not rush to France's side but continued to send Forman on his <b>shuttle</b> <b>diplomacy</b> missions to try to conciliate the opposing demands of Pope Julius II and King Louis XII. Eventually, after Forman's failure to bring the pontiff and the French king together, James after consultation with his General Council renewed the Franco-Scottish alliance in July 1512—only two councillors opposed the decision.|$|E
