50|$|The Rover 200 Coupé was {{equipped}} with a specially shaped split glass roof system with a central T-Bar. The twin panels could be tilted or detached independently, and the bar itself could also be removed and stored in the boot in a special protective cover.

40|$|DE 10231139 C UPAB: 20031030 NOVELTY - The <b>sun</b> <b>blind,</b> {{composed}} {{of a number of}} parallel slats (L) which can rotate around their longitudinal axes, are each fitted with a number of compound parabolic concentrators (CPC) (1) on their upper sides (LO). The CPCs are of a dielectric material with an exposed side towards the light, and a receiver side aligned at the slat surface. The upper side of each slit is at least partially curved or angled across its longitudinal axis, with a reflective or opaque surface. The CPCs lie directly on the slat surfaces, or are held by a reflecting or transparent intermediate adhesive layer. USE - The <b>sun</b> <b>blind</b> is especially for mounting between the glass panes of a double glazing installation. ADVANTAGE - The slats of the <b>sun</b> <b>blind</b> effectively reflect incoming light to shade the interior behind it...|$|E

50|$|Perforated {{films were}} sold in the 1970s and 1980s as <b>sun</b> <b>blinds</b> for {{vehicles}} and buildings. This was cited in the first patent application for see-through graphics.

50|$|Car glass {{includes}} windscreens, {{side and}} rear windows, and glass panel roofs on a vehicle.

Some vehicles include <b>sun</b> <b>blinds</b> for rear and rear side windows. The window shield of a car is appropriate for safety and protection of debri in the road. It also comforts the driver as well. The majority of car glass is held in place by glass run channels, which also serve to contain any fragments of glass if the glass breaks.|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{is presented to}} determine the wind loads on external solar blinds on two 60 m high towers. This investigation was performed some years after {{the construction of the}} towers, with the <b>sun</b> <b>blinds</b> in place. A combination of wind tunnel tests and full scale measurements was done. The shape of the towers, and the unique design of the solar blinds, make that this design is not covered in any wind loading code. However, during the design stage, a simplified approach was adopted to construct the solar blinds and its load bearing structure. During operation of the building, damage occurred to some of the hangers of the structure and doubts were raised whether the wind loads on the external blinds were properly estimated. The results of the current investigation are being used for a re-analysis of the structure, and may lead to replacement of parts of the structure...|$|R

5000|$|The most {{important}} {{changes were made}} to the front and rear of the body where the designers reinterpreted the styling in a more modern idiom. In particular, the tail was squared and simplified, and the nose lost its separate air intake and headlamp nacelles. The mechanics retained most of the Flavia's specifications including the front-wheel drive, boxer engine, independent suspension and disc brakes all around, with vacuum-assist and split-circuits (called [...] "Superduplex" [...] by Lancia).The 2000 used the 1991 cc 4-cylinder boxer engine, available in either carbureted form (115 hp) or with fuel-injection (126 hp). The latter abandoned the previously used Kugelfisher mechanical system in favor of a more reliable Bosch D-type electronic system. The transmission (produced by ZF) was a 4-speed manual-type for the 2000 equipped with a carburetor, and a manual 5-speed for the fuel-injected 2000. Since the 2000 was given a flagship role for Lancia (following in the footsteps of the prestigious Flaminia), the 2000 was given a high standard of finishes (fine wood for the dashboard and velvet or leather upholstery) and standard or optional equipment including hydraulically operated power steering (also manufactured by ZF), air conditioning, electric windows and <b>sun</b> <b>blinds.</b>|$|R

40|$|Optical {{satellite}} communications play {{an increasingly important}} role {{in a number of}} space applications. However, if the system concept includes optical links {{to the surface of the}} Earth, the limited availability due to clouds and other atmospheric impacts need to be considered to give a reliable estimate of the system performance. An OGS network is required for increasing the availability to acceptable figures. In order to realistically estimate the performance and achievable throughput in various scenarios, a simulation tool has been developed under ESA contract. The tool is based on a database of 5 years of cloud data with global coverage and can thus easily simulate different optical ground station network topologies for LEO- and GEO-to-ground links. Further parameters, like e. g. limited availability due to <b>sun</b> <b>blinding</b> and atmospheric turbulence, are considered as well. This paper gives an overview about the simulation tool, the cloud database, as well as the modelling behind the simulation scheme. Several scenarios have been investigated: LEO-to-ground links, GEO feeder links, and GEO relay links. The key results of the optical ground station network optimization and throughput estimations will be presented. The implications of key technical parameters, as e. g. memory size aboard the satellite, will be discussed. Finally, potential system designs for LEO- and GEO-systems will be presented...|$|R
