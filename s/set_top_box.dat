5|$|When digital {{television}} launched on 1 January 2001, {{the majority of}} households {{did not know of}} or were unable to buy a <b>set</b> <b>top</b> <b>box</b> in order to receive the signal. Digital Broadcasting Australia was established in late 2000 to help make the transition to {{digital television}} as seamless for consumers as possible. It included representatives from free-to-air broadcasters, manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers and was intended to provide information about commencement dates, coverage, and the functionality and availability of equipment.|$|E

2500|$|The BBC, which {{ultimately}} broadcast high-definition television on Freeview in the DVB-T2 format adopted in 2009, initially considered an alternative method utilising spare capacity {{at night to}} allow the download of high definition programmes for later replay. In addition the BBC's Research and Development team invented a transmission method that doubles the effective bandwidth that could currently be delivered by each multiplex using [...] "spatial multiplexing". While conventional analogue and digital terrestrial television signals are transmitted either vertically or horizontally polarised (providing protection against interference from other distant signals which may be transmitted on the same frequency, but will usually be planned to use the opposite polarisation), the proposed technique would have involved using the same frequency to transmit two different signals at once, one vertically and one horizontally polarised. A special receiving aerial, containing both vertically and horizontally polarised elements, could receive both signals simultaneously and feed these to a suitable <b>set</b> <b>top</b> <b>box,</b> but would require new transmitters and receiving equipment and aerials; the technique was ultimately not adopted.|$|E
