5|$|Everest {{was born}} and brought up in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, west Wales; most of his family remain in the area. His parents were restaurateurs. He had aspired to become a racing driver. But, his {{ambition}} unfulfilled, {{he took a job}} with his uncle when he was 17, working as a <b>sales</b> <b>assistant</b> at Hepworths, Milford Haven; a high street tailor that would form the foundation of the Next retail empire. In the early 1980s, he became interested in the club scene, often driving to London, where he mixed with New Romantics such as Boy George at The Blitz; a trendy London nightclub run by Steve Strange of the group Visage.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's early {{economy was}} based on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber. During the 1880s {{agricultural}} products became the highest export earner and farming was a major occupation within New Zealand. Farming is still a major employer, with 75 000 people indicating farming as their occupation during the 2006 census, although dairy farming has recently taken over from sheep as the largest sector. The largest occupation recorded during the census was <b>sales</b> <b>assistant</b> with 93,840 people. Most people are on wages or salaries (59.9 percent), with the other sources of income being interest and investments (24.1 percent) and self-employment (16.6 percent).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The social {{relationship}} between <b>sales</b> <b>assistants</b> and customers {{has often been}} described as relatively one-sided one in which <b>sales</b> <b>assistants</b> are subordinate to customers. One {{of the ways in}} which the subordination of <b>sales</b> <b>assistants</b> is manifested is when customers treat them badly, for instance in the form of verbal and physical abuse. We suggest that these power relations are not one-sided, but consist of both of the normative subordination that has been described in much of the previous research and of organisational superordination over customers. We also suggest that in many instances, difficult customer behaviour is triggered by this inherent contradiction in the role of <b>sales</b> <b>assistants.</b> When <b>sales</b> <b>assistants</b> perform superordinate actions, customers can respond by attempting to undermine the sales assistants’ superordination and restore normative subordination. The empirical data consist of observations and interviews with employees of a large supermarket and two filling stations in southern Sweden...|$|R

40|$|Conversations among {{and between}} our fellow {{customers}} and sales personnel provide social and informational exchange to support material exchange in retail settings. A 2 x 2 factorial field experiment (in a ladies' clothing retailing context) was undertaken to compare {{perceptions of the}} effects of oral contributions made by <b>sales</b> <b>assistants,</b> and by fellow customers, on levels of satisfaction, purchase intentions and credibility during the service experience. Conversations with other customers are shown to lead to greater perceived satisfaction in the consideration phase than those with <b>sales</b> <b>assistants.</b> <b>Sales</b> <b>assistants</b> are confirmed as less credible, and the notion that spoken interactions with assistants may lead to increased purchase intention is rejected...|$|R

25|$|Upselling {{and cross}} selling are {{sometimes}} known as suggestive selling. When the consumer has selected their main purchase, sales assistants {{can try to}} sell the customer on a premium brand or higher quality item (up-selling) or can suggest complementary purchases (cross-selling). For instance, if a customer purchases a non-stick frypan, the <b>sales</b> <b>assistant</b> might suggest plastic slicers that do not damage the non-stick surface.|$|E
40|$|Research {{investigating}} attributional {{style and}} job performance among sales staff {{has been limited}} by its focus on specific sales roles: notably selling insurance by telephone. Important questions therefore remain regarding the mechanism by which attributions influence job performance in sales roles more generally. This paper describes a field study comparing two attributional models of job performance: (1) a learned helplessness (LH) model, and (2) an achievement motivation (AM) model. Managers' performance ratings were collected for 452 retail <b>sales</b> <b>assistants</b> who completed a job-specific attribution questionnaire and a work-satisfaction questionnaire. Results indicate that <b>sales</b> <b>assistants</b> who made more internalcontrollable attributions for positive outcomes received higher performance ratings (r =. 20, p<. 01) and were more satisfied in their work (r =. 12, p<. 05). The findings provide support for an AM model of job performance among retail <b>sales</b> <b>assistants.</b> They suggest that more successful <b>sales</b> <b>assistants</b> proactively manage their environment {{in order to create}} opportunities for successful interactions with customers...|$|R

25|$|In 1846, Charles Frederick Worth {{moved to}} Paris. He arrived there {{speaking}} no French and with £5 in his pocket.

In 1989, he moved to Los Angeles, where he took up residence in a small Hollywood apartment. He took {{a job in the}} gift shop of CBS studios, eventually working his way up to manager. Here, he was apparently privy to some inside gossip, part of the inspiration for founding the Drudge Report. Worried about his son’s aimlessness, Drudge's father insisted on buying him a Packard Bell computer in 1994. The Drudge Report began as e-Mail notes sent out to a few friends.|$|E

Ian eventually forgives Michelle but Martin still refuses to speak to her. Michelle attempts to find work in schools, without any luck. Stacey invites Michelle to a family meal but Martin says Michelle is only pretending to care about her family, and tells her that she is not the big sister he used to look up to. Michelle starts community service and hears that Tim wants a divorce, and she tries to avoid the issue. Eventually, Martin and Michelle start to talk again but he is still angry that she has behaved like a teenager. Michelle then realises that she needs to apply for other jobs so enquires about a <b>sales</b> <b>assistant</b> job, which she successfully obtains. Whilst travelling to work Michelle meets Tom Bailey (Daniel Casey) on the tube and she eventually gets the courage to ask him {{to go out on a}} date.|$|E

40|$|Computer {{systems that}} serve as {{personal}} <b>assistants,</b> advisors, or <b>sales</b> <b>assistants</b> frequently need to argue evaluations of domain entities. Argumentation theory shows that to argue an evaluation convincingly requires to base the evaluation on the hearer's values and preferences.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a field {{study of the}} Technology Acceptance Model. We extended this model to predict the acceptance of a multifinctional, broker workstation with a windowed interface.

The extended model explains a significant percentage of the variance in usage, but the variables that are most salient in the model differ between brokers and <b>sales</b> <b>assistants.</b> There is evidence that low performing brokers use the workstation more than higher performing brokers; the results also suggest that more training may be needed for sophisticated workstations for professionals than for clerical personnel learning to use transactions processing systems.
