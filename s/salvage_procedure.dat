50|$|Arthrodesis {{is used in}} horses as a <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure</b> {{to treat}} severe {{breakdown}} injuries, such as failure of the suspensory apparatus, subluxation, fracture, or collateral ligament rupture. It is also performed in horses suffering from osteoarthritis, primarily of the distal hock joints, to fuse these low-motion joints so they no longer produce pain for the animal.|$|E
5000|$|The procedure, a Femoral head ostectomy [...] - [...] {{also known}} as a Femoral head and neck ostectomy [...] - [...] is a <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure,</b> mostly used in cases of severe damage through Hip {{dysplasia}} or Arthritis in which the Head (and, sometimes, the Neck) of the Femur are removed, allowing fibrous tissue to grow in place, creating effectively, a pseudo-joint.|$|E
50|$|A femoral head ostectomy (FHO) is a {{surgical}} procedure that removes {{the head and}} neck from the femur. FHO surgery is performed to alleviate pain. It is a <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure,</b> reserved for condition where pain can not be alleviated in any other way. It is common in veterinary surgery. Other names are excision arthroplasty of the femoral head and neck, Girdlestone's operation, Girdlestone procedure, and femoral head and neck ostectomy.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures</b> play {{a crucial}} role in the care of the uremic patient, {{influencing}} quality of life and overall survival. In this study, we report on our centre's experience and analyse the outcomes, in terms of cumulative patency, of surgical <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures</b> on complicated AVFs. METHODS: Our study included patients who underwent surgical <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures</b> of their AVFs in our centre from 22 / 12 / 2009 to 29 / 12 / 2011. Early and late <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures</b> were analysed separately. RESULTS: Of 617 vascular access <b>procedures,</b> 136 <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures</b> were performed, 24 of which were defined as early and 112 as late. Among <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures,</b> re-anastomosis was the most frequently performed, (37. 2...|$|R
30|$|The {{treatment}} of chronic radial head dislocation remains controversial and many operations for chronic dislocation of the radial head show unsatisfactory results and {{are described as}} <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures</b> [5].

50|$|Small {{horses and}} ponies can have an ostectomy without an {{osteotomy}} of the greater trochanter. As a <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure,</b> this is usually performed in those animals which have the specific injury of a fracture of the capital physis. These patients would not return {{to function as a}} riding horse and the procedure may be performed for those animals involved in breeding, milking, and being kept as companion animals.|$|E
50|$|DDFT tenotomy {{is usually}} {{recommended}} {{in cases of}} laminitis and coffin bone rotation that is chronic or non-responsive {{to other forms of}} treatment. Transection of the DDFT reduces the pull {{on the bottom of the}} coffin bone, and subsequently decreases the stress placed on the laminae of the hoof. A horse will not be athletically useful following a DDFT tenotomy, with a best-case scenario of the animal returning to pasture soundness or possibly for comfortable enough for light pleasure riding. It is therefore considered a <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure</b> to improve the quality of life of the horse, often as final effort to avoid euthanasia. This procedure may be performed standing under local anesthesia. The DDFT is cut at the level of the mid-cannon or mid-pastern, although the mid-cannon is preferred to avoid the flexor tendon sheath. A DDFT tenotomy can also be used to treat severe cases of flexural limb deformity in foals, but it is also a <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure</b> and prevents the animal from any future athletic use.|$|E
50|$|Paste {{grafting}} is {{a relatively}} simple surgical procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting. It requires minimal special instrumentation. Unexpected lesions can be treated. No tissue culture or foreign matrices are required. Paste grafting has been an effective <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure</b> for failed microfracture, failed Osteochondral Autograph Transplant Surgery (OATS) or Mosaicplasty procedures, Carticel and TruFit procedures. Compared {{to the cost of}} other complex cartilage restoration procedures, the cost of paste grafting is minimal. Disadvantages include limited experience with patella paste grafting and it remains difficult to access the very far posterior lesions.|$|E
30|$|Hwang et al. [9] {{reported}} on the functional outcomes of <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures</b> for children with cerebral palsy who had chronic dislocations of the hip using validated scoring systems. In their study, the children were divided into three groups: the PFRA group as described by McCarthy et al. [12], the SVO group, and the SVO with resection of the femoral head group [18]. Hwang et al. [9] concluded that these <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures</b> produced similar results; however, they recommended the use of PFRA as the complications are relatively less severe [9]. In comparison to Hwang et al.â€™s study, we used a shoulder prosthesis as opposed to muscle interposition. Our rationale for use of a shoulder prosthesis is that it prevents bony impingement of the proximal femur on the ilium when proximal migration occurs by acting as an interpositional material.|$|R

30|$|The {{indications}} {{for using}} a <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure</b> as a first option are very limited. There {{is nothing in the}} literature to suggest that excising or replacing the ulnar head acutely has a benefit over waiting to assess the final result. We therefore recommend an initial approach of restoring and maintaining the overall alignment of the ulna and DRU-joint with the later option of a <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure</b> depending on the final result.|$|E

5000|$|A {{salvage company}} named Svitzer {{was hired to}} assess the safety of {{contracted}} salvage teams on the ship and to continue to carry out <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures.</b> Matthew Watson, a spokesman for Svitzer, described the key tasks {{carried out by the}} salvage teams to be removal of oil off of the ship (specifically through a transferring process) and the collection of released containers and other waste.

40|$|With modern limb <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures,</b> {{successful}} reconstruction is {{not always}} achieved. This lecture will utilize case presentations to show increased functional benefit in patients who underwent elective amputation surgeries. Neurological damage, severe burn, and brachial plexus injuries are common occurrences that lead to a nonfunctional problematic reconstructed limb.

30|$|The first {{option is}} to restore and {{maintain}} the overall alignment of the ulna and DRU-joint. This could be done with manipulation and above elbow cast immobilisation alone or alternatively by surgical means with temporary wiring or external fixation. A <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure</b> could then be considered {{at a later date}} depending on the outcome. The potential problems with this management are wrist stiffness and reduced forearm rotation that may not be corrected with a late <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E
30|$|Use of {{constrained}} bearing inserts {{should be}} considered as a <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure,</b> since they reduce the rate of dislocation, but are not effective in reducing the rate of re-revision.|$|E
30|$|The second {{option would}} be to {{consider}} a <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure</b> acutely using a primary distal ulnar head replacement as described above [38] or ulnar head resection and soft tissue interposition [39].|$|E
30|$|Clinical {{evaluation}} {{of the effectiveness of}} PFIA yielded variable results with this cohort of children with regards to pain and range of motion. Despite these varied results, the majority of caregivers were satisfied with the outcome and would recommend PFIA. PFIA is a salvage option for the painful, spastic dislocated hip, but significant evidence to prove its effectiveness over other <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures</b> is lacking. Based on our results, we conclude that PFIA has the ability to benefit children with cerebral palsy with an acceptable risk profile similar to that reported in recent publications.|$|R

40|$|Partial {{and total}} calcanectomy is an {{infrequently}} cited procedure often overlooked {{for the treatment}} of pathologies of the calcaneus. Calcanectomies can be performed on the diabetic and non-diabetic, the ambulatory and non-ambulatory, and patients with or without osteomyelitis. Benefits of calcanectomy include maintenance of ambulatory status and quality of life and decreased morbidity and mortality. Additionally, calcanectomy failure does not alter {{the next step in the}} treatment algorithm, which is below-the-knee amputation. Calcanectomy, a simple, viable, limb <b>salvaging</b> <b>procedure,</b> should be considered an alternative to a below-the-knee amputation in surgical candidates with calcaneal pathology...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic {{brachial plexus}} {{injuries}} rarely recover spontaneously {{and if the}} window period for neurotisation has elapsed, the only option for restoration of function lies in a <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure.</b> Many such salvage procedures have been described in the literature with variable functional results.

40|$|We {{retrospectively}} {{reviewed the}} effectiveness of peripheral sympathectomy for severe Raynaud's phenomenon. In this study, a total of 14 digits from six patients with chronic digital ischemic change were included. All patients had pain, ulcer, or gangrenous change in the affected digits and were unresponsive to pharmacologic or other nonsurgical therapies. In all cases, angiography showed multifocal arterial lesions, so microvascular reconstruction was unfeasible. Peripheral sympathectomy was performed as a <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure</b> to prevent digit amputation. The results were analyzed according to reduction of pain, healing of ulcers, and prevention of amputation. In 12 of the 14 digits, the ulcers healed and amputation was avoided. In the other two digits, the ulcers improved and progressive gangrene was limited. As a <b>salvage</b> <b>procedure</b> for Raynaud's phenomenon recalcitrant to conservative treatment, peripheral sympathectomy improves perfusion to ischemic digits and enables amputation to be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Open {{musculoskeletal}} injuries {{remain a}} difficult problem to manage especially in resource-poor regions.

40|$|The aim was {{to assess}} the value of reoperative surgery for pouch-related {{complications}} after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for chronic ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. Between January 1981 and August 1989, 114 of 982 IPAA patients (12 %) seen at the Mayo Clinic had complications directly related to IPAA that required reoperation. Among the 114 patients, the complications prevented initial ileostomy closure in 33 patients (25 %), occurred after ileostomy closure in 68 patients (60 %), and delayed ileostomy closure in the remaining patients. The <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures</b> performed included anal dilatation under anesthesia for anastomotic strictures, placement of setons and/or fistulotomy for perianal fistulae, unroofing of anastomotic sinuses, simple drainage and antibiotics for perianal abscesses, abdominal exploration with drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses with or without establishment of ileostomy, and complete or partial reconstruction of the reservoir for patients with inadequate emptying. None of the reoperated patients died. Reoperation led to restoration of pouch function in two thirds of patients and, of these, 70 % had an excellent clinical outcome. However approximately 20 % of the 114 pouches required excision. Excision was common, especially among patients who had pelvic sepsis. <b>Salvage</b> <b>procedures</b> for pouch-specific complications can be done safely and will restore pouch function in two thirds of patients. Complications after reoperation, however, may ultimately lead to loss of the reservoir in one in five patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: Although large {{published}} series {{have described}} {{their experience with}} the management of failed or failing prosthetic arteriovenous grafts for hemodialysis, there are scant data regarding failing arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs). To analyze the management of nonfunctioning or nonmaturing AVFs, we reviewed our experience with <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures</b> for these AVFs. Material and Methods: Of the 474 AVFs placed at our institution in 380 patients between June 1997 and March 2001, 75 revisions were performed in 46 patients (49 AVFs). Ages of these patients ranged from 29 to 94 years (mean, 68 Â± 1. 4 years). Diabetic patients comprised 51 %, and hypertensive patients comprised 75 %. Twenty patients underwent 26 vein patch angioplasties, and 17 patients underwent 24 balloon angioplasties. Four patients required four vein interpositions, and 12 patients underwent 12 revisions of the fistula to a more proximal level. Extended <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures</b> consisted of four turn-downs to the basilic vein for proximal cephalic vein thrombosis or stenosis and five extension bypasses to the axillary or jugular vein for subclavian vein thrombosis. Results: Follow-up ranged from 1 to 31 months (mean, 10 months). The patients who underwent open revisions tended to need fewer subsequent procedures. However, primary patency of the vein patch angioplasty was not significantly better as compared with balloon angioplasty (P =. 8) by life table analysis. Patency after revision of a radial cephalic fistula and brachial cephalic fistula were not statistically different. One interposition failed during the follow-up, and one revision to a more proximal level thrombosed during the follow-up. Two of the turn-down procedures had thrombosed at 2 and 11 months. The remaining two turn-down procedures have remained functional at 1 and 24 months. One of the extensions thrombosed at 8 months whereas the other four have remained functional at 1, 6, and 8 months. Conclusions: Despite the limited follow-up data, this review suggests that simple and extended <b>salvage</b> <b>procedures</b> may allow maturation {{and add to the}} life span of AVFs for hemodialysis. In addition, these data suggest an advantage for open techniques as compared with percutaneous techniques but only in terms of requiring fewer subsequent procedures.
