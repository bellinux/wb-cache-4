5|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} Madonna in different styles and fashions. It also includes her dripping in twenty million {{dollars worth of}} vintage jewels and gowns in several transformations, including an original 25carat ring and bracelet that was worn by West in the 1933 film, She Done Him Wrong. A real doctor (Dr. David Kish) was hired by Madonna to administer the fake shots, since <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the scenes appear real. The first day of shooting took place on June 2, 2003, and the scenes shot included the wall-of-mirrors, the massage, the botox injection and the ballet dancing sequences. The next day started with the French maid, the motel TV, the telephone conversation and the glamour shot scenes. Henry Keazor, {{one of the authors}} of Rewind, Play, Fast Forward: The Past, Present and Future of the Music Video, noted that Madonna exposed herself during the interventions portrayed in the video, by playing with the rumors and the stereotypes surrounding her.|$|E

25|$|Lamphere {{represented}} an unresolved danger to Gunness; now Asle Helgelien was making inquiries that {{could very well}} send her to the gallows. She told a lawyer in La Porte, M.E. Leliter, that she feared for her life and that of her children. Ray Lamphere, she said, had threatened to kill her and burn her house down. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> out a will, in case Lamphere went through with his threats. Leliter complied and drew up her will. She left her entire estate to her children and then departed Leliter's offices. She {{went to one of}} the La Porte banks holding the mortgage for her property and paid this off. She did not go to the police to tell them about Lamphere's allegedly life-threatening conduct. The reason for this, most later concluded, was that there had been no threats; she was merely setting the stage for her own arson.|$|E
25|$|From {{the time}} of Genie's {{admission}} doctors saw clearly picked up some nonverbal information, with Kent emphasizing that she seemed very intent on looking at peoples' faces and made decent eye contact from other people, and she showed {{a small amount of}} responsiveness to it {{even in the absence of}} language. Despite this, Kent noted that she could only get across a few very basic needs and neither made facial expressions nor used any discernible body language. When Genie was upset she would engage in silent, expressionless, self-harming tantrums until she had physically tired herself out, after which she immediately reverted to being completely non-expressive. She never cried during these outbursts—according to several firsthand accounts she could not cry at all—and if <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> noise she pushed chairs or other objects. On a few occasions she responded to stimuli with a very soft, high-pitched, shrill laugh, but was otherwise completely undemonstrative.|$|E

CeCe then begins to explain her story and motives, revealing that she was born as Charles, but was not accepted by her father for believing she was a girl. She was sent to Radley, where she eventually transitioned into Charlotte. She also explains what led to Mrs. Cavanaugh's death at the hands of Bethany Young, her complicated relationship with Bethany and her subsequent death, the events regarding the night Alison disappeared, the deal she made with Mona, the events at the burning lodge, Wilden's death, the events in New York, and their mother's death. She explained that she did everything just to be closer to her family, and she became 'A' when she thought that the Liars were happy about Alison's 'death', so <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them suffer for it but couldn't stop the game because she grew obsessed with it. Cece also reveals that Sara is both the other Red Coat and The Black Widow, working under CeCe's orders, leaving Emily distraught. CeCe heads for the roof to commit suicide (after her bomb attempt fails and Emily subdues Sara), but Alison and the girls convince her to stop, saying they now understand why she became 'A'. CeCe then surrenders and declares the game over. On Labor Day weekend, the girls say goodbye as they are leaving for college except for Alison who stays in Rosewood.|$|E

Of its twelve songs, ten were co-written by Annie.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] was {{directed}} by Matthew Rolston, and was filmed from August 8–10, 1998 at Silvertop House in Los Angeles, California and Malibu Beach. According to Entertainment Tonight, the filming was emotional for Madonna due to the song's meaning of break-up and [...] "love story gone wrong". <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the visual's storyline dramatic, hence chose Rolston as the director and together they concocted the emotional narrative of the clip. Although she respected the director's vision of the clip, Madonna nevertheless {{wanted to be a}} part of the creative process of the videotaping. The scenes of the singer walking along the beach were shot with her actually walking on a treadmill.|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} her {{perspective on}} her music, Chana identified it as [...] "trop-electro-hip-pop". She followed this up by explaining: [...] "The definition of pop has become looser, more inclusive. When {{you talk about}} pop, you're basically talking about a hook, a melody that catches your attention." [...] She said that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the material both easily accessible, as well as artistic, clarifying that she never {{set out to make}} music as experimental as that of Björk. She experimented with Caribbean music after developing an interest in it while studying African-American dance and music in the Dominican Republic. When asked about how her music is received, Chana responded that various Latin communities responded to it differently as they had different definitions of mainstream and underground music.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{theme song}} is {{a cover of}} Ben E.

The cover used a full orchestra, including brass, strings and timpani. In addition, the recurring theme [...] "Prelude to Final Fantasy" [...] was incorporated as a backing player on the harp. Welch stated that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a [...] "mystical" [...] contribution to the game.

500|$|Anniemal {{focuses on}} heavily layered beats, {{with a strong}} 1980s influence.

Unlike many of her contemporaries, Annie avoids using an ironic or kitschy in her take on 1980s music. The songs' styles span genres including bubblegum pop, electro, disco, R, dance-pop, and rock. Annie's DJing experiences taught her about sound and production and affected her music. She stated that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a pop album that would not quickly become dated, [...] "an album that you could listen to in five years and it wouldn't sound terrible." [...] Annie considered excluding [...] "Greatest Hit" [...] from Anniemal to achieve this but ultimately included it because she felt it did not sound {{as if it were}} five years old.|$|E
500|$|Following her well-received {{performance}} in What Maisie Knew, Moore began 2013 with {{a supporting role}} in Joseph Gordon-Levitt's comedy Don Jon, playing an older woman who helps the title character to appreciate his relationships. Reviews for the film were favorable, and Mary Pols of Time magazine wrote that Moore was {{a key factor in}} its success. Her next appearance was a starring role in the comedy The English Teacher (2013), but this outing was poorly received and earned little at the box office. In October 2013, she played the demented mother Margaret White in Carrie, an adaptation of Stephen King's horror novel. Coming 37 years after Brian De Palma's well-known take on the book, Moore stated that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the role her own. By drawing on King's writing rather than the 1976 film, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that she managed to [...] " [...] a history– one never told, just hinted at– of serious damage in [...] past." [...] The film was a box office success, but was generally considered an unsuccessful and unnecessary adaptation.|$|E

500|$|In {{making the}} album Parablepsia, Kawada {{describes}} {{the concept of}} the album as [...] "E.M.R.", which stands for [...] "Electric. Mami Kawada. Rock". She considers [...] "Borderland" [...] to be most representative of her style, so <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an album which included songs which sounded similar to it. Originally, she only wanted a single song to convey the theme of the album, but for Parablepsia, several songs do. This includes the title song [...] "Parablepsia", which she describes as a song about not losing yourself in a society which moves around in circles, [...] "Fly Blind", which is a song about not always allowing yourself to be influenced by society, [...] "Eager Eyes", which is the song in the album which has the closest style to [...] "Borderland", [...] "It's no big deal", which takes inspiration from a phrase that her father used to say to her, and [...] "Dendritic Quartz", which is about flowers which constantly bloom and will never wither; [...] "Dendritic Quartz" [...] takes inspiration from a pendant she owns which has a pattern of trees.|$|E
500|$|Jepsen's second studio {{album was}} {{initially}} {{planned to be}} released on February 14, 2012; however, she chose not to release it because <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure she [...] "got the second CD right.

[...] She then worked with songwriter Josh Ramsay and producer Ryan Stewart on most of the album's tracks. Jepsen's songwriting process was inspired by her life and friends. After the recording sessions were completed, Curiosity was announced as a full-length album, with a digital release date confirmed for February 14, 2012. A few days before its official release, however, the label decided to change the format of the album, turning it into an extended play.

500|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{technology}} used to for the video, Robyn believed [...] "It looked like 'MacGyver' on the set." [...] She said that the video [...] " [...] very much about [...] giving almost a physical experience of {{what it feels like}} to be on a dance floor or fall in love, whether it's blood or endorphins or other body fluids." [...] <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a video about sex, but said that [...] "in a way that wasn't so clichéd. [...] And [...] is made to give you a picture of what sex really is, which I think is something that's very hard to do, because sex is everywhere all the time, but very rarely is it made out to be something real." [...] The video begins with a reversed scene of a young couple having sex. In cutscenes, Robyn appears with a tube dress with clear liquid flowing through it. When the young woman begins to switch her sex partners, the liquid in the tubes wrapped around Robyn begins to alter colors and flow more quickly.
