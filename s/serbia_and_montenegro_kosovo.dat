Even {{there are}} just four sovereign(internationaly recognised) states among those entities, number of different names (8) shows to us all fragmentation and tendencies toward further dissolution of this region to increasing number of small and weak states. Tendencies that are shown in WB region are quite different from those in other transition countries in Europe. Instead of cooperation in economic, financial and all other important fields, like Visegrad group countries did in nineties and strenghten their negotiation position compared with the EU, WB countries try to flatter to EU member states and to build their better position through deterioration {{of the position of}} other regional states. On the internal plan, all WB countries are still rely on weak institutional capacity - mechanisms that enables governments non-transparent behavior, manipulation with judicial system and judges, selective implementation of the laws, very high and resistant level of corruption in all social and economic fields, surviving of organised crime structures which are very often related to government officials at all levels of authority etc. Integration of WB countries in the EU will be very long term and difficult process as the precondition for that will be building of effective institutional mechanisms that could provide governance comparative with other transition countries and in more distant future with European mature market economies. It isimportant also to establish efficient regional cooperation and to increase level of income and competitiveness to cope with the competition from EU. Experiences from other Balkan countires should be useful for WB region - Greek's as one old member state and Romania's and Bulgaria's as candidate meber states. WB countries expect to have greater understanding of EU officials for the very serious problems that have to be resolved and it is out of question that without important support from outside WB it will be impossible to do so. ...|$|E

40|$|Summary: In {{the period}} from 2001 to 2006, the Western Balkans served as a testing ground for the {{development}} of the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy. This paper explores a variety of legal and political aspects of the EU’s efforts to stabilise the Western Balkans in an attempt to answer the question about what the EU should have learned in so doing. Attention is paid to the diplomatic efforts of the EU to prevent (the escalation of) confl ict in Macedonia, between <b>Serbia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Montenegro,</b> <b>and</b> in <b>Kosovo.</b> The role and impact of the EU’s fi rst-ever - and so far biggest - police and military operations are also evaluated. It is argued that lessons learned from these actions should be taken to heart before the EU decides to embark on any future missions. Otherwise, history may prove that the Western Balkans offered the EU’s one and only chance to develop credible and lasting foreign policy, security, and defence arrangements...|$|R

40|$|The Kosovo Liberation Army, {{which was}} {{regarded}} as a 'terrorist' group in the early 1990 s, has now been 'transformed' into the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) with the primary objective of protecting this war-torn province against 'natural' disasters. The creation of a 'civilian', uniformed and 'multi-ethnic' corps is a unique experience for the international community as it has been undertaken by a United Nations interim administration within the sovereignty of a state-the now defunct Federal Republic of Yugoslavia-that had no input during the planning or implementation of this transformation process. In fact, if it ends up comprising the core of a future Kosovar army, as its members hope it will, the KPC is likely to pose a direct threat to the sovereignty of <b>Serbia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Montenegro</b> over <b>Kosovo.</b> This article explores the KPC transformation experience with a security sector reform perspective, focusing on institutional, political, financial and security aspects in order to identify lessons that can inform similar processes elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|South Slavs {{have been}} {{repeatedly}} used as precedents for {{international humanitarian law}} and consequently have affected global developments: from the international concern over positions of Christians in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 1870 s {{that led to the}} peaceful replacement of imperial rule to the late 20 th century in the NATO intervention against <b>Serbia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Montenegro</b> over <b>Kosovo</b> Albanians, which {{led to the creation of}} the newest nation-state in Europe. In addition to internal factors, the very creation of the common South Slav state was a result of international interventions, as was the dissolution of the country. The League of Nations ruling in favour of the Yugoslav complaint against Hungary in 1934 aided in developing the UN Security Council resolutions against Afghanistan in September 2001. Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1995 was a precedent for the UN sanctioned intervention, while Kosovo was a precedent for the non-sanctioned American-led intervention. Afghanistan, East Timor, Iraq, Libya are all legal consequences of interventions in the Balkans. Therefore, local history of interventions can lead to a general understanding of the development of international humanitarian law...|$|R

Muslim Albanians, along smaller numbers of urban Turks (some with Albanian heritage), were expelled from most parts of the Sanjak of Niş and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet during and after the Serbian-Ottoman War (1876-78). An estimated 60-70,000 to as low as 30,000 Albanians were either expelled, fled and/or retreated from the captured areas seeking refuge in Ottoman Kosovo. During the Balkan Wars, Muslim Albanians were deported from Christian territories, and settled in the Ottoman Empire, as far as the Middle East. Cham Albanians massively fled Greece after World War II, in which they had collaborated with the Italians, fearing reprisals.|$|R
40|$|After the {{breakdown}} of SFR Yugoslavia in 1991, The Republic of Macedonia had entered into a challenging phase of transition toward market economy and democracy. Political efforts for implementation of democracy were more successful then efforts for achievement of economic stability and growth. Indicators in the Table 1 show serious problems in functioning of the Macedonian economy {{in the last few}} years, although the problems had existed from before. Due to economic and political reasons they became worse in the last decade. Political instability in the Balkan region causes high level of political and economic risk that had affected Macedonian economy very badly. Political and economic turbulences on the Balkan region in the last decade were not in favor of Macedonian progress toward EU. The culmination of the events for Macedonia was military conflict within the country in 2001.

5000|$|In the 1980’s Yugoslavia {{began to}} break into fragments. The {{economic}} conditions within Yugoslavia were deteriorating.

This combined with escalating violence from ethnic Albanians and Serbs within Kosovo intensified economic conditions. This violence greatly contributed to the rise of extreme nationalism of Serbs in <b>Serbia</b> <b>and</b> within Yugoslavia. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo was propagandized by Communist Serbian Slobodan Milosevic to further increase Serb nationalism. As mentioned, this nationalism did give rise to powerful emotions which grew the force of Serbian nationalism through highly nationalist demonstrations in Vojvodina, <b>Serbia,</b> <b>Montenegro,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Kosovo.</b> Serbian nationalism was so high, Slobodan Milosevic was able to oust leaders in Vojvodina <b>and</b> <b>Montenegro,</b> further repressed Albanians within Kosovo and eventually controlled four of the eight regions/territories.

[4] These and other resources Kosovo is endowed with represent the key supporting factors of Kosovo’s development, current and future. In fact, as any other country, Kosovo is also characterized by limiting elements in terms of extent of natural resources that may be available for utilization. As it is widely known, in conditions of free market economy and privatization, possibilities of ensuring a proper planning for the utilization of all natural resources available are considerably relative. Setting from {{the fact that there are}} no inexhaustible resources, it is necessary that relevant mechanisms are in place and authority to undertake all possible measures to provide for a diligent and rational utilization thereof. To achieve such a goal, modern countries, including Kosovo, have passed relevant laws.

After a short introduction, this paper {{argues that the}} purpose of CEFTA is to enable its members to enter the EU more easily, and thus serves as an instrument of EU accession. Reference is made to the most important benefit of the old CEFTA, which was the common preparation for integration to the EU’s market. By analysing the impact of the old CEFTA as a pre-accession instrument, an analogy is made with the new CEFTA, where emphasis is placed on its role as a regional cooperation instrument. The paper aims to compare the provisions of CEFTA 2006, the Treaty establishing the European Community, and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, mainly from the perspective of Croatia.
