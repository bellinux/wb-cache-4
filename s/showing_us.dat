500|$|After {{watching}} {{the first three}} episodes, Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine also praised the new season, writing [...] "The plots have generally been the [...] "fringe" [...] of Fringe; the meat {{has been in the}} characters' developing feelings for one another. Now the two are not only on equal footing, but they're both firing on full cylinders... Afraid, perhaps, to toy with viewers the way that Lost did, Fringe keeps the action moving, rapidly unspooling its mysteries, and that decision proves to be a wise one. Rather than waiting for a future payoff, Fringe is cashing in with every episode, <b>showing</b> <b>us</b> the escalating war between worlds—and with likeable characters and compelling cases to boot. Ironically, it's by branching out in two different directions that the show has become, more than ever, the centerpiece of a hypercompetitive Thursday night lineup." ...|$|E

500|$|Charlie Jane Anders of io9 {{believed}} that {{some elements of}} the film were deliberate self-references to Michael Bay's own sense of under-appreciation after the backlash to the second film: [...] "After {{a few hours of}} seeing Shia get dissed, overlooked and mistreated, the message becomes clear: Shia, as always, is a stand-in for Michael Bay. And Bay is <b>showing</b> <b>us</b> just {{what it felt like to}} deal with the ocean of Haterade—the snarking, the Razzie Award, the mean reviews—that Revenge of the Fallen unleashed." [...] She went on to say that the film's frequent, often jarring shifts in tone were an intentional endorsement of Michael Bay's own filmmaking style. [...] "Tone is for single-purpose machines. Consistency is for Decepticons. Michael Bay's ideal movie shifts from action movie to teen comedy to political drama with the same well-lubricated ease that his cars become men. By the time you've finished watching, you will speak Michael Bay's cinematic language." ...|$|E

According to Sepinwall, [...] "Say Hello to My Little Friend" [...] was [...] "effective" [...] as it [...] "forced [...] to finally confront a truth about his situation", and that he finally needs to grieve, by recognizing that one of his two loved ones is dead. Sepinwall praised how the episode [...] "kept mirroring moments in the pilot", while Screen Rant writer Kevin Yeoman called the installment itself [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "compelling".

Busis explained, [...] "Yes, people fall in love quickly in traditional bedtime stories. But at least in the animated version of Beauty and the Beast, we could understand why Belle and her hairy paramour were meant to be. 'Skin Deep' didn't bother to explain that attraction." [...] In a contribution for Tor.com, Teresa Jusino defined [...] "Skin Deep" [...] as an [...] "amazing retelling of the Beauty and the Beast story that contained some wonderful character moments and some great one-liners... Funny, charming, and at times harrowing, the script takes us into the depths of Rumpelstiltskin’s soul, <b>showing</b> <b>us</b> this character both at his most warm and at his most dark."

[...] Ritkoff expressed that the episode's conclusion was a rational and level-headed resolution to the storyline; [...] "Whatever jealousy he might feel, it would have been absurd for Rick to punish the woman he loves most in the world for post-apocalyptic infidelity under these circumstances." [...] Sepinwall commended Rick's reaction to Lori's confessions, and Goldman felt that their interaction was well acted and perfectly scripted. Venable appraised the segment as [...] "very engaging", and applauded Lincoln's performance. He wrote, [...] "Andrew Lincoln delivered these lines of pitiable understanding as well as anyone could."

500|$|In 2006 (2007 in North America), Murphy {{starred in}} Ken Loach's {{film about the}} Irish War of Independence and Civil War, The Wind That Shakes the Barley, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and became the most {{successful}} Irish independent film at the Irish box office. Murphy was especially keen on appearing in the film due to his intimate connections to Cork, where it was shot. Murphy had to audition six times {{for the role of}} Damien O'Donovan, a young doctor turned revolutionary, before winning the part. Murphy considered it a very special privilege to have been given the role and stated that he was [...] "tremendously proud" [...] of the film, remarking that the [...] "memories run very, very deep– the politics, the divisions and everybody has stories of family members who were caught up in the struggle". Critic Denby noted Murphy's moments of deep stillness and idiosyncrasies in portraying the character. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Murphy is especially good at playing the zealotry as well as the soul-searching and the regret, at <b>showing</b> <b>us</b> a man who is eaten up alive because he's forced to act in ways that are contrary to his background and his training."

GameTrailers rated it an 8.6/10, and praised the voice acting while criticizing the corny dialogue. IGN gave it an 8.7 saying, [...] "Whether it's on the PS3 or the 360, action fans {{are going to}} get one incredible experience with this game, and if you own either system, you'll have a great time." [...] However, the review also noted that, contrary to Kobayashi's claim, [...] "Dante simply doesn't have nearly as many weapons as he did in DMC3" [...] and found that [...] "the amount of backtracking and repetition makes the game feel somewhat half-heartedly finished in the design department." [...] GameSpy gave it 4 stars out of 5, stating that [...] "DMC4 succeeds on many levels because it fuses fan service with entertaining gameplay", finding that [...] "visually, DMC4 is a dynamo." [...] The review also praised Nero for [...] " [...] something fresh to the franchise" [...] and being [...] "as diverse as DMC3 SE's Vergil"; however, they also claim that [...] "it cheapens things a little to see that the team has opted to recycle assets in lieu of <b>showing</b> <b>us</b> more of this rich world" [...] and call out the [...] "annoying industrial-meets-butt-rock soundtrack".

500|$|The episode {{received}} consistently positive reviews. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a positive review, writing [...] "One of the strengths of 'Monday' is in <b>showing</b> <b>us</b> Scully's evolution and how her experiences with Mulder allow her to embrace, albeit reluctantly, ideas that are not grounded in science." [...] Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the [...] "finest stand-alone episode" [...] of the sixth season and wrote, [...] "Time loops, if dragged on for too long, can become tedious, but in small doses they can be hilariously funny or achingly poignant. This episode is definitely the latter, as the downtrodden girlfriend of a bank robber is forced to witness the deaths of her boyfriend, Mulder, Scully and {{a large group of}} innocent people die over and over again until finally she breaks the loop by dying herself [...] The onus of saving everyone being largely on the shoulders of an unknown woman effectively brings in a change of pace and a welcome breath of fresh air." [...] Earl Cressey from DVD Talk called [...] "Monday" [...] one of the [...] "highlights of season six." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A" [...] and called it [...] "a script which balances humor, structural brilliance, and compassion in equal measure." [...] Handlen compared and contrasted the episode to Groundhog Day, noting that, while both feature a character who is able to restart a day, in [...] "Monday", the characters have the benefit of free will and can change factors: [...] "Every Monday to her has certain basic requirements: boyfriend with bomb, bank robbery, the FBI agents [...] and the earth-shattering Kaboom.

500|$|The pilot {{received}} favorable reviews {{upon its}} release. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette {{thought it was}} a [...] "respectful addition to Superman lore" [...] and had [...] "all the markings of a super series". Owen noted the Christ-like imagery of the scene, stating, [...] "Is it any wonder Clark gets tied up there since Superman, too, was 'sent to save us'?" [...] Echoing Owen, DVD Verdict noted the same symbolism: Superman is, in a way, the secular pop culture stand-in for Jesus Christ, a messiah figure for our generation. The series makes this theme explicit in its pilot episode, in which Clark is symbolically 'crucified' in a cornfield. That striking bit of symbolism becomes the central preoccupation of the series; Clark is the savior who sacrifices all for the greater good of humanity, and Smallville shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that role. Elizabeth White of Media Life believed the show had potential to be a big hit for The WB but felt it needed to survive not only its time slot—Tuesdays at 9:00 p.m. (EST)—but also the audience's expectations of [...] "what Superman should be". USA Todays Robert Bianco was a bit more mixed in his criticism. Bianco stated, [...] "For all its innovations, there's also something rehashed and repetitive about Smallville... shows often look more familiar at the outset than they do as they progress. There's talent and intelligence at work in Smallville. Given time, maybe they'll find a more distinctive voice." [...] Jeremy Conrad, from IGN, swore to himself that he would never watch Smallville, because he was a [...] "huge Superman fan" [...] and he did not like the idea the creators would be making changes to the Superman mythology. After viewing the pilot, Conrad stated, [...] "It's a very solid start to the series, and one of the better pilot episodes I've seen in a while." [...] In The Futon Critic's 50 best episodes of 2001 rankings, the pilot was placed 31st, with Brian Ford Sullivan stating, [...] "Smallville opened us to a surprisingly fresh take on the Superman myth-this time <b>showing</b> <b>us</b> the humble beginnings of a young Clark Kent." ...|$|E
