5|$|The {{submarine}} {{was used}} in filming the 1950 film, Morning Departure, a naval film directed by Roy Ward Baker. During the course of filming, the submarine depot ship HMS Maidstone {{was used as a}} mother ship for Tiptoe. In 1952 a further cinematic link was made when ballet dancer Moira Shearer presented a pair of size 3.5 satin ballet shoes to Tiptoe that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> in the 1948 film The Red Shoes. These are now at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum. Whilst in Tromsø harbour on 18 July 1955 Tiptoe was damaged when a coastal steamer collided with her. The steamer, a 2,162 tonne vessel called Nordlys, was entering the harbour when she collided with the British destroyer HMS Chevron. The steamer bounced off the destroyer and collided with Tiptoe, snapping her moorings as she was pushed halfway under a wooden quay.|$|E
5|$|Since {{being brought}} to London Belfast has twice been drydocked {{as part of the}} ship’s {{long-term}} preservation. In 1982 she was docked at Tilbury, and in June 1999 Belfast was towed to Portsmouth. This {{was the first time she}} had been to sea in 28 years and thus required a Certificate of Seaworthiness from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. While in dock, her entire hull was cleaned, blasted, and repainted, her hull blanking plates inspected and an ultrasonic survey carried out. She is not expected to require further drydocking until 2020. While under tow to Portsmouth she was delayed by bad weather and arrived a day late: it had been intended that she would arrive on 6 June 1999, the fifty-fifth anniversary of the Normandy landings. During the maintenance work, Belfast hull and topsides were repainted in her specific camouflage scheme officially known as Admiralty Disruptive Camouflage Type 25, which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> from November 1942 to July 1944. This was objected to by some, due to the anachronistic conflict between her camouflage, which reflects the majority of her active Second World War service, and her present configuration, which was the result of the ship's extended refit from January 1956 to May 1959. With the establishment of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's (DCMS) Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships in 2006, Belfast was listed as part of the National Historic Fleet.|$|E
25|$|In September 1988, Minogue {{released}} her own fashion range, Dannii. She {{became interested in}} fashion design while appearing on Young Talent Time. Minogue had designed the clothing <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> on the show, and the positive response from the audience resulted in her releasing her own line. Minogue's debut line Dannii sold out across Australia in ten days, and was followed by three additional summer lines in 1989.|$|E

25|$|Isabella {{took the}} habit of the Poor Clares before she died on 22 August 1358 at Hertford Castle, and her body was {{returned}} to London for burial at the Franciscan church at Newgate, in a service overseen by Archbishop Simon Islip. She {{was buried in the}} mantle <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> at her wedding and at her request, Edward's heart, placed into a casket thirty years before, was interred with her. Isabella left the bulk of her property, including Castle Rising, to her favourite grandson, the Black Prince, with some personal effects being granted to her daughter Joan.|$|E
25|$|To Canada, Arthur {{brought with}} him {{his wife and his}} {{youngest}} daughter, the latter of whom would become an extremely popular figure with Canadians. The Governor General and his viceregal family travelled throughout the country, performing such constitutional and ceremonial tasks as opening parliament in 1911 (to which Arthur wore his field marshal's uniform and the Duchess of Connaught wore the gown <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> at the King's coronation the previous year) and, in 1917, laying at the newly rebuilt Centre Block on Parliament Hill the same cornerstone his older brother, the late King Edward VII, had set on 1 September 1860, when the original building was under construction. The family crossed the country a number of times and the Governor General made another trip to the United States in 1912, when he met with President William Howard Taft.|$|E
25|$|The Titanic is {{the best}} known aspect of Dorothy's life. After a six-week {{vacation}} in Italy with her mother, she was returning on the Titanic {{to make a new}} series of pictures for Eclair at Fort Lee. The women had been playing bridge with friends in the lounge {{on the night of the}} ship's fatal collision with the iceberg. With two of their game partners they escaped in Lifeboat #7, the first lifeboat launched. After arriving in New York on the rescue ship Carpathia, Dorothy was persuaded by her manager to appear in a film based on the sinking. She not only starred in the one-reel drama but also wrote the scenario. She even appeared in the same clothing <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> aboard the Titanic that night—a white silk evening dress topped with a cardigan and polo coat.|$|E

25|$|By December 18, Gacy was {{beginning}} to show visible signs of strain {{as a result of}} the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 civil suit against the Des Plaines police, demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to a Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> the jacket and had placed the receipt in the parka pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor. This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11: the presence of the receipt indicated that Gacy must have been in contact with Robert Piest after the youth had left the Nisson Pharmacy on December 11.|$|E
500|$|Previously, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> {{a bikini}} made of meat {{on the front}} cover of the Japanese edition of Vogue.

Although it was Gaga's third costume change of the evening, the meat dress was immediately described as [...] "most outrageous fashion moment" [...] of the evening.|$|E
500|$|Foster and Geto set {{the public}} {{tone of the}} {{campaign}} battling Save Our Children and were determined not to [...] "get down in the gutter with them", refusing to run an ad showing Bryant in a revealing outfit <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> while performing in 1971, nor run commercials {{to point out that}} child molesters were primarily heterosexual. However, they also encountered difficulty when local newspapers refused to run ads that were designed to appeal to Miami's sizable Jewish community, equating Bryant's rhetoric with the same language that many Miami citizens faced during the Holocaust. Twenty-eight of Miami's thirty-four rabbis agreed with Bryant and her campaign–the president of the Miami Beach B'nai B'rith served as an officer of the Save Our Children coalition.|$|E

500|$|She died at Kensington Palace on {{the morning}} of 3 December 1939 at the age of 91 years, 8 months and 15 days, the same age to the day as her younger brother Prince Arthur, wearing the wedding veil <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> almost 70 years earlier. Following a simple funeral, owing to the war, her remains [...] were cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 8 December. Her ashes were quietly placed in the Royal Crypt at St. George's Chapel on 12 December, with many members of the Royal and Argyll {{families}} present. Her ashes were moved to the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore near Windsor, on 13 March 1940. Louise's will stated that if she died in Scotland she should be buried at the Campbell mausoleum in Kilmun next to her husband; if in England, at Frogmore near her parents. Her coffin was borne by eight NCOs of her own regiment, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.|$|E
500|$|A {{backdrop}} {{then started}} showing the newspaper reports on Madonna's 1985 Playboy nude picture release. The backdrop moves up as Madonna appears, wearing a loose-fitted black pant and top, with bejeweled glasses, for singing [...] "Where's the Party". For [...] "Into the Groove" [...] Finch joins her on stage to dance alongside. Madonna then wore a pink bolero jacket {{which had the}} can of soup and the words [...] "U" [...] and [...] "DANCE" [...] flanking it. At the end she is joined by her backup singers and dancers. Together they take a bow to the audience and finish the performance. Next Madonna sang [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] {{as a part of}} the encore, wearing the same red flamenco dress <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> in the video. For [...] "Who's That Girl", Madonna—flanked by Finch and a male dancer—strutted around the stage, asking the audience to join her on the chorus. Lastly, Madonna performed an energetic version of [...] "Holiday", signaling the celebratory and wholesome nature of the song's theme. The song featured a new arrangement, with a guitar solo in the intermediate portion added by Leonard. She sang the final chorus twice, then asked the audience for a comb so that she could fix her hair and finished the performance, after taking a bow with her dancers to the audience.|$|E
2500|$|She wore a dress <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> on {{her debut}} {{a few weeks}} previously, a sheer evening gown with a {{plunging}} neckline that displayed her ample cleavage.

2500|$|Church historians record Mavia's exploits, {{focusing}} {{in particular}} {{on the condition}} she set for the truce she procured from the Romans, which {{is considered to be}} important to early Christian evangelical efforts in the Levant.

After <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> down the Roman army in several battles, had felled a great many, and had put the remainder to flight, she was asked to make peace, which she did on the condition already declared: that a certain monk Moses be ordained bishop for her people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, {{she began}} writing her own risqué plays using the pen name Jane Mast. Her first {{starring}} role on Broadway {{was in a}} 1926 play she entitled Sex, which she wrote, produced, and directed. Although conservative critics panned the show, ticket sales were hot. The production did not go over well with city officials, who had received complaints from some religious groups, [...] and the theater was raided, with West arrested along with the cast. She {{was taken to the}} Jefferson Market Court House, (now Jefferson Market Library), where she was prosecuted on morals charges, and on April 19, 1927, was sentenced to 10 days for [...] "corrupting the morals of youth". [...] Though West could have paid a fine, and been let off, she chose the jail sentence for the publicity it would garner. While incarcerated on Welfare Island (now known as Roosevelt Island), she dined with the warden and his wife; she told reporters that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> her silk panties while serving time, in lieu of the [...] "burlap" [...] the other girls had to wear. West got great mileage from this jail stint. She served eight days with two days off for [...] "good" [...] behavior.
