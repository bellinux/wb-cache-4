40|$|The {{inner surface}} of reactor {{pressure}} vessels is protected against corrosion by an austenitic cladding. Generally, the cladding is welded on the ferritic base metal with two layers to avoid cracks under the cladding {{and to improve}} the microstructure of the cladding material. On the other hand, due to the cladding process and the difference of the thermal expansion coefficient of the austenitic cladding and the ferritic base material, residual stresses are acting over the wall thickness. This residual stress field {{is important for the}} integrity assessment of the component. For the determination of the residual stress field, plates of a reactor pressure vessel steel were cladded by <b>submerged</b> <b>arc</b> welding and <b>heat</b> treated, representative of the real component. The numerical simulation was performed with the finite element code SYSWELD. The heat source of the model representing the welding process was calibrated against the temperature profiles measured during welding. In the analysis, the temperature-dependent material properties, as well as the transformation behaviour of the ferritic base metal, were taken into account. The calculated residual stresses show tensile stresses in the cladding followed by compressive stresses in the base metal that are in agreement with measurements with X-ray diffraction technique. After post-weld heat treatment the residual stresses in the ferritic base metal are reduced significantly...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the minimum}} Gibbs Free Enthalpy {{algorithm}} (FEM), {{model of the}} ferrosilicon smelting process has been presented. It is a system of two closed isothermal reactors: an upper one with a lower temperature T 1, and a lower one with a higher temperature T 2. Between the reactors and the environment {{as well as between}} the reactors inside the system, a periodical exchange of mass occurs at the moments when the equilibrium state is reached. The condensed products of chemical reactions move from the top to the bottom, and the gas phase components move in the opposite direction. It can be assumed that in the model, the Reactor 1 corresponds to the charge zone of <b>submerged</b> <b>arc</b> furnace where <b>heat</b> is released as a result of resistive heating, and the Reactor 2 corresponds to the zones of the furnace where heat is produced by electric arc. Using the model, a series of calculations was performed for the Fe-Si-O-C system and was determined the influence of temperatures T 1, T 2 on the process. The calculation results show a good agreement model with the real ferrosilicon process. It allows for the determination of the effects of temperature conditions in charge zones and arc zones of the ferrosilicon furnace on the carbothermic silica reduction process. This allows for an explanation of many characteristic states in the ferrosilicon smelting process...|$|R

Copper cladding of mild steel substrates by deposition from strip electrodes using the <b>submerged</b> <b>arc</b> welding {{process has been}} successful. A wide range of parameters, and several fluxes have been investigated. The range of deposit compositions is 66. 4 % Cu to 95. 7 % Cu.

The melting rate for strip electrodes is dependent upon the current-voltage product.

40|$|The {{development}} of feedforward semi-empirical control models for furnaces and {{the evaluation of}} mass balances are based on plant data. The models can only {{be as good as}} the data and it is therefore required to know the inherent uncertainty associated with the plant data. This uncertainty stems mainly {{from the fact that the}} slag, alloy or dust, have a distributed nature that depends on the degree of mixedness. It is commonly accepted that melts from open bath furnaces are well-mixed, and <b>submerged</b> <b>arc</b> furnaces less so. The impact of this assumption is significant, as a reasonably homogeneous melt could be represented by one sample only. As so much of metallurgical control depends on the assay information of the alloy and slag melts from furnaces, it was decided to characterise the possible variation in melt chemistry and temperature. Sampling campaigns and continuous temperature measurement of the melts were performed for different alloy and slag taps at a major ferrochrome producer.

40|$|Bibliography: page 123. This project {{deals with}} Acoustic Noise Analysis in a <b>submerged</b> <b>Arc</b> Furnace. Operators and Metallurgists {{believe that the}} {{acoustic}} noise coming from the furnace conveys information as to the operating conditions of the furnace. This <b>submerged</b> <b>arc</b> furnace reduces ferrochrome ore to the metal. A carefully made-up mixture of ore and slag producing materials is continually fed into the furnace. Three large carbon electrodes provide the heat to melt the ore by means of resistance heating and/or arcing. The exact mechanism is unknown. The furnace is rated at 48 MVA maximum and the electrodes carry currents {{of the order of}} 100 kiloamperes. The metal is tapped approximately every four hours. The term <b>submerged</b> <b>arc</b> is used because the furnace is completely enclosed and the arc occurs below a layer of ore mix. This differs from an open arc furnace which does not have a roof and where the operators can actually see into the top of the furnace. The operation of the <b>submerged</b> <b>arc</b> furnace is also different from that of a scrap melting electric arc furnace. A scrap furnace has set melting cycles and has acoustic noise changes determined by falling metal, melting and initial arcing. Higgs, Papadakis and Sheets (Ref. 1) performed signature analysis on acoustic noise from a scrap furnace to differentiate between different operating conditions in the furnace. The aim of the present project was to collect and analyze data records of acoustic noise and operating conditions from the number four furnace at Ferrometals 1 Witbank. The data was recorded on analogue and computer magnetic tape and analyzed at UCT. The analysis was aimed at explaining the operators' theory of the acoustic noise relating to operating conditions of the furnace. This procedure is different from that of Reference 1 in that they did their analysis with an on-plant analyzing computer, and that their furnace had a set defined cycle whereas the <b>submerged</b> <b>arc</b> furnace is a continuous feed system. Reference 1 is the only known information relating to the analysis of noise in the electric arc furnaces, and their furnace operation is largely different to that of the furnace used in this project...|$|R
