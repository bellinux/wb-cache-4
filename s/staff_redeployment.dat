ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{qualitative}} study explores {{the effect that}} staff deployment has on the morale and professional attitudes of educators who {{have been identified as}} being in excess at their schools. The study was done by doing interviews with teachers who have been affected by rightsizing and redeployment and principals who have had to manage the process. The Department of Education goes through an annual process of determining the school‘s staff establishment for the next academic year. This determination is {{based on the number of}} learners enrolled at the institution. The CEMIS statistics are used to determine the number of learners enrolled at the school and the schools‘ staff establishment for the next academic year. If a school‘s learner numbers have increased since the last survey, the school will gain some teaching posts. Conversely, if the learner numbers have dropped a number of educators at the institution, as determined by the education department, have to be identified and declared in excess. Change associated with <b>staff</b> <b>redeployment</b> can have a negative impact on the morale and motivation of teachers. A school‘s functioning and ability to supply quality education can also be compromised as a result thereof. This is especially true when schools do not have the financial resources to employ additional teachers out of school funds. The problem is researched by exploring the ‗lived experiences‘ of selected teachers at primary schools in two of the education districts that fall under the WCED. Educators who were selected to participate in the study were individuals who had been declared in excess and who were redeployed or who were awaiting redeployment. Teachers were given the opportunity to relate their individual experiences. Their accounts of the process reflect how these experiences affect behaviour, professional attitude and general health. My discussion of their perceptions pays particular attention to their perceptions of how their general health and well-being were affected. Two principals (who managed the process at their respective schools) also shed some light on their experiences of the effects of downsizing. It seems that whilst there are cases where the process of rightsizing and redeployment is handled with the necessary care and circumspection, this is not always the case. Too often rightsizing and redeployment are handled in a clinical way, which creates the impression that the principals are biased and unsympathetic. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Hierdie kwalitatiewe studie ondersoek die effek wat personeel ontplooing op onderwysers het wie oortollig verklaar word by hul skole. Dit beoog ook om vas te stel tot watter mate die persoon se professionele gedrag en moraal geaffekteer word hierdeur. Tydens die studie was data ingesamel deur onderhoude te voer met onderwysers wie oortollig verklaar is, en prinsipale wat hierdie proses moes bestuur. Jaarliks gaan die Departement van Onderwys deur 'n proses waar skole se onderwysvoorsiening vir die volgende jaar bepaal word deur die aantal leerders wat by die skool ingeskryf is. Die stelsel wat deur die WKOD gebruik word om leerder inskrywings by skole te bepaal, word die Sentrale Opvoedingsbestuur en Inligting Stelsel genoem. Fundameteel tot die proses is die feit dat indien 'n skool se leerdertal vermeerder het sederd die vorige opname, sal die skool addisionele onderwysers win. Indien die inskrywingstotaal egter gedaal het, word die aantal onderwysers wat aan die skool voorsien word verminder. Verandering wat deur die onderwyser herontplooiing teweegbring word kan 'n negatiewe uitwerking op die moraal en motivering van onderwysers het. Die funksionering van skole en hul vermoeë om gehalteonderrig te voorsien kan ook negatief beïnvloed word daardeur. Dit is veral skole wat dit nie kan bekostig om addisionele onderwysers aan te stel en uit skoolfonds te besoldig nie, wat die swaarste getref word hierdeur. Die probleem word nagefors deur te kyk na 'n paar onderwysers in primêre skole in twee opvoedingsdistrikte wat onder die WKOD werksaam is. Onderwysers wat deel vorm van die studie is persone wat oortollig verklaar is en verplaas is, of wie nog wag op verplasing. Hierdie studie het onderwysers se ervaringe van die herontplooingsproses bestudeer. Onderwysers was die geleentheid gegee om hul ervaringe met die naforser te deel en sodoende lig te werp op hoe die proses hul gedrag, professionele houding en algemene gesondheid geraak het. Die naforsing het getoon dat terwyl daar gevalle is waar die proses van regstellende aksie en herontplooing met die nodige sorg en omsigtigheid hanteer word, is dit nie altyd die norm nie. Hierdie proses word ten tye op 'n kliniese wyse hanteer en dit skep die indruk dat die prinsipaal onsimpatiek is en nie neutraal staan in die proses nie...|$|E

We coordinated {{the organization of}} Evolution 2014, which was a time-consuming but, ultimately, highly successful event. We also busied ourselves with our wind-down activities and {{spent a great deal}} of time planning for what NESCent is likely to become. The center has been granted a no-cost extension of funding through November 30, 2015. We have instituted a plan and a timeline for winding down that includes <b>staff</b> <b>redeployment</b> or reduction, data archiving, and the disposal of assets. As part of NESCent’s plan for future sustainability, we have assembled a Transition Team, comprising faculty from the three partner institutions (Duke University, UNC-Chapel Hill, and N. C. State University) who are likely to lead the next incarnation of the center. The Transition Team has been tasked with working with interested faculty and senior leaders at the three universities to develop an acceptable proposal and budget for a possible center that focuses on comparative evolutionary medicine. NESCent coordinated the organization of the Evolution 2014 conference, held at the Raleigh Convention Center from June 20 to 25, 2014. Many staff were involved in the planning and execution of the conference, which saw the second largest attendance at any Evolution conference since its inception: close to 2, 000 participants, more than 1, 000 talks, more than 400 posters, and an average of 13 parallel sessions each day. In 2015, we will still have quite a full schedule of meetings, and the NESCent space will be well-occupied until we close our doors, because we will relocate our informatics team to the main building, and we will have short-term visitors and postdoctoral fellows. Additionally, we will work with the Transition Team to trial several programs that will form the suite of activities for Tri-CEM. At the end of June 2014, remaining staff will be tasked with completing all financial tasks and archiving and disposing of assets. Over the past year, all of NESCent’s core science activities– postdoctoral fellows, graduate fellows, long- term sabbaticals, short-term visiting scholars, working groups and catalysis meetings– have been active. We stopped accepting applications for working groups and postdoctoral fellowships in December 2012, and we stopped accepting applications for catalysis meetings and sabbaticals in December 2013, but the activities supported in the last round of proposals will carry through our no-cost extension. In 2014, NESCent’s Calls for Proposals attracted eight proposals for catalysis meetings and sabbaticals and 35 proposals for short-term visitors and graduate fellowships. This represents an intended scaling back relative to previous years. Of these 43 total proposals, 34 were assessed very favorably during our review processes and were supported. During year 10, the center will have hosted nine postdoctoral fellows, nine sabbatical scholars, one Triangle research fellow, 18 short-term visitors, 13 graduate students, and several visiting and resident scientists. In the past four years we have introduced four targeted initiatives to jumpstart new areas of evolutionary synthesis: Evolutionary Medicine, Synthetic Biology, Evolution and the Social Sciences, and K- 12 Evolution Education for Underrepresented Minorities. We currently have seven postdoctoral scholars, three of whom will remain supported until the end of the no-cost extension and four of whose departures are staggered between now and June 2015. In addition, we will host four sabbatical scholars and an estimated 20 short-term visitors between now and June 2015. At the moment we have 32 meetings that are or will be scheduled through June 2015; these include 10 ‘fifth meetings’ of working groups who have completed four meetings, have demonstrated exceptional productivity, and have proposed an additional meeting in response to a Call for Proposals that we issued specifically to PIs of existing or completed working groups. We also plan one more round of applications for catalysis meetings in October 2014. NESCent continues to provide versatile, state-of-the-art informatics support for the center’s sponsored science program and to build capacity within the evolutionary science community at large. At the same time, the NESCent has turned its attention in the past year to providing closure to its informatics commitments and ensuring that software and data assets arising from activities are appropriately managed and stewarded after the closure of the center. Major custom informatics work in the past year includes the TraitDB web application, the Database of Phylogenies of Languages for the study of Cultural Evolution (DPLaCE), and a Fossil Calibrations Database. The recently launched NESCent Collection in the new Nature Publishing Group publication Scientific Data provides a prestigious outlet for the publication of datasets arising from sponsored science, particularly those that do not fall within the scope of a single publication. Four data descriptors are published or in press as of the end of August, and new ones are to be added to the collection on a rolling basis. NESCent continues to host major informatics initiatives supported by external funds, including the OpenTree AVAToL project, the Dryad Digital Repository, and the Phenoscape Knowledgebase. The Informatics team held an internal hackday and anticipates being involved in two hackathons in the coming year. Through a partnership with several other NSF BIO Centers (iPlant, iDigBio, BEACON and SESYNC), Mozilla Science Labs, and DataONE, NESCent was pleased to host the first offering of Data Carpentry (DC) in May 2014. Nurturing self-sustaining training initiatives like Data Carpentry provides another way for NESCent to make a long-lasting investment in training that will produce returns even without the center’s continued involvement. Plans are being executed for continued maintenance and hosting of online databases by researchers and their institutions. When there is not a viable option for continued maintenance, we are working with scientists to archive database contents in a reusable form. In its tenth year, NESCent has continued its education and outreach activities while also seeking solutions to ensure the continuation of established programs by various partners. For the fourth consecutive year, the Darwin Day Roadshow visited 14 schools in six different states and partnered for the first time with colleagues at the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action and Lehigh University. The NESCent Ambassador program ended its third and final year with trips to Trinidad, Jamaica, and Galapagos. NESCent partnered with BEACON at the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) for activities including the Evolution Symposium, the Evolution Scholar Award for biology instructors, and the NABT Evolution Education Award. The Education and Outreach division also continued to run a collection of activities at the annual Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) conference and will do so again in October. NESCent also collaborated with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences to host the annual Darwin Day event in February and the three-day summer workshop for 18 high school instructors from North and South Carolina in June. At the Evolution 2014, the center continued to support the Undergraduate Diversity at Evolution program and the NESCent MSI Faculty Travel Award, which funded 25 undergraduates and three faculty members from minority-serving institutions. NESCent Academy ran or co-sponsored several short courses, three of which were in house. The center also conducted weekly seminar series, as well as a Director’s Seminar Series, which brought in more diverse speakers beyond the local area. As we enter our final year, our efforts are focused on continuing the established, successful programs and preparing a transition of the aforementioned activities with a consortium of partners (BEACON, ASN, SSB, and SSE). Plans are underway for BEACON to provide salary for an outreach director who will run most of NESCent’s existing outreach programs and activities with support from the three societies. In the past year the communications director wrote and distributed eight news releases highlighting published results from NESCent-sponsored projects on topics ranging from how barnyard chickens came to be, to why some species have superior smarts, to how plants evolved to cope with cold. These news releases for the 2013 - 2014 received more than 30, 000 page views through the news service Eurekalert, and NESCent-sponsored research was featured in more than 60 articles in mainstream outlets such as Science News, National Geographic, Science Magazine and Discover. The media outlets that covered our science collectively reach millions of readers each month, a readership that no academic journal could achieve. NESCent sponsored its final blog contest and conference travel fellowship in which evolutionary bloggers received a travel and lodging stipend to attend the annual ScienceOnline conference. In its fourth year, the journalist-in-residence program welcomed an entomologist, freelance writer and photographer from the National Museum of Natural History; a Montana newspaper staff researching evolution and climate change; and a Pakistani science journalist and multimedia producer. NESCent has issued its final call for proposals for journalists-in-residence. The deadline is December 1, 2014, and the recipient(s) would arrive in January of February 2015. As part of the NESCent Celebration in November, the communications division is creating a special bumper issue of the quarterly newsletter. In addition to the typical contents, the double-length issue will revisit past stories and include brief summaries of the center’s accomplishments over the past decade. The assessment team has continued to evaluate how successfully NESCent is fulfilling its mission by applying a three-tiered system focused on people, products, and processes. For products, we focused on building accurate records of publications and grants resulting from NESCent activities and by utilizing ImpactStory to measure the usage of such publications and products. We also collaborated with an assessment working group, which will reconvene for its third meeting in December 2013. The “Science of Science” project analyzes the center’s processes to improve the way the center promotes synthetic evolutionary science. NESCent’s papers accumulated 19, 479 citations compared to the 13, 219 citations from the same time last year. The average number of average number of coauthors per paper has continued to stay steady at a little less than four since 2009, but this past year it has increased to about five. The center continues to see an influx of new visitors and strives to maintain a 50 : 50 ratio of emerging to experienced scientists. In the final year, the assessment team will concentrate its efforts on outlining a final assessment report to sum the productivity and impact of the center. We intend to publish our results and contribute to the relatively thin literature on the sociology and policy of synthetic science. In the past year, the primary focus of the administration at NESCent has been to increase the visibility of working group, sabbatical scholar, and short-term visitor support as we meet the demands of the grant closure. The administrative staff was also involved in organizing the Evolution 2014 meeting both during the lead-up to the conference and at the conference itself. Several staff members including our communications manager, IT analyst, and logistics coordinator have already left for new opportunities, and we expect more departures in the coming months. In the meantime, we continue to support the career transition of our team through a focused professional program and opportunities to participate in relevant courses, workshops, and training. In November 2014, NESCent will host a final symposium at the Washington Duke Inn. We anticipate hosting more than 30 ongoing working group meetings, as well as several graduate students, sabbatical scholars, short-term visitors, a journalist-in-residence, and a Triangle Scholar before the center closes in June 2015. The team will also focus on archiving all print and electronic records; managing the reduction in force issues for a staff of 20; closing the physical center in July, 2015; providing final reporting in September 2015; and closing the financial grant record in November 2015...|$|E
40|$|Legacy documents, such as {{requirements}} documents or manuals {{of business}} procedures, can sometimes offer an important resource for informing what features of legacy software are redundant, {{need to be}} retained or can be reused. This situation is particularly acute where business change {{has resulted in the}} dissipation of human knowledge through <b>staff</b> turnover or <b>redeployment.</b> Exploiting legacy documents poses formidable problems, however, since they are often incomplete, poorly structured, poorly maintained and voluminous. This report proposes that language engineering using tools that exploit probabilistic natural language processing (NLP) techniques offer the potential to ease these problems. Such tools are available, mature and have been proven in other domains. The document provides a review of NLP and a discussion of the components of probabilistic NLP techniques and their potential for requirements recovery from legacy documents. The report concludes with a summary of the preliminar [...] ...|$|R
