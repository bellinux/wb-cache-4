40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of digital breast tomosynthesis into clinical practice requires quality control procedures. In {{this study we}} have investigated whether {{the assessment of the}} average glandular dose for modelled <b>standard</b> <b>breasts</b> can be performed using a combination of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyethylene (PE) slabs that matches <b>standard</b> <b>breast</b> thicknesses. For this purpose the energies absorbed per unit area of the image receptor when imaging <b>standard</b> <b>breasts</b> and PMMA-PE slabs have been matched taking account of both primary and scattered photons. To achieve this a two-step approach was used. Firstly, the behaviour of the scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR) of PMMA-PE <b>phantoms</b> and <b>standard</b> <b>breasts</b> was investigated using Monte Carlo simulations for various conditions. For imaging without an anti-scatter grid, {{it was found that the}} values of <b>standard</b> <b>breast</b> and <b>phantom</b> SPR were significantly different and it follows that these differences are relevant when matching the absorbed energy. In the second part, a set of PMMA-PE combinations is proposed which, for dosimetric purposes, can be used to simulate <b>standard</b> <b>breasts</b> in the thickness range 20 to 100 mm.

40|$|Abstract—Microwave imaging {{has been}} {{suggested}} as a promising modality for early-stage breast cancer detection. In this paper, we propose a statistical microwave imaging technique wherein a set of generalized likelihood ratio tests (GLRT) is applied to microwave backscatter data to determine the presence and location of strong scatterers such as malignant tumors in the breast. The GLRT is formulated assuming that the backscatter data is Gaussian dis-tributed with known covariance matrix. We describe the method for estimating this covariance matrix offline and formulating a GLRT for several heterogeneous two-dimensional (2 -D) numerical <b>breast</b> <b>phantoms,</b> several three-dimensional (3 -D) experimental <b>breast</b> <b>phantoms,</b> and a 3 -D numerical <b>breast</b> <b>phantom</b> with a realistic half-ellipsoid shape. Using the GLRT with the estimated covariance matrix and a threshold chosen to constrain the false discovery rate (FDR) of the image, we show the capability to detect and localize small (< 0. 6 cm) tumors in our numerical and exper-imental <b>breast</b> <b>phantoms</b> even when the dielectric contrast of the malignant-to-normal tissue is below 2 : 1.

40|$|PURPOSE: In the {{research}} and development of dedicated tomographic breast imaging systems, digital breast object models, also known as digital phantoms, are useful tools. While various digital <b>breast</b> <b>phantoms</b> do exist, {{the purpose of this study}} was to develop a realistic high-resolution model suitable for simulating three-dimensional (3 D) breast imaging modalities. The primary goal was to design a model capable of producing simulations with realistic breast tissue structure. METHODS: The methodology for generating an ensemble of digital <b>breast</b> <b>phantoms</b> was based on imaging surgical mastectomy specimens using a benchtop, cone-beam computed tomography system. This approach allowed low-noise, high-resolution projection views of the mastectomy specimens at each angular position. Reconstructions of these projection sets were processed using correction techniques and diffusion filtering prior to segmentation into breast tissue types in order to generate phantoms. RESULTS: Eight compressed digital phantoms and 20 uncompressed phantoms from which an additional 96 pseudocompressed digital phantoms with voxel dimensions of 0. 2 mm(3) were generated. Two distinct tissue classification models were used in forming <b>breast</b> <b>phantoms.</b> The binary model classified each tissue voxel as either adipose or fibroglandular. A multivalue scaled model classified each tissue voxel as percentage of adipose tissue (range 1 %- 99 %). Power spectral analysis was performed to compare simulated reconstructions using the <b>breast</b> <b>phantoms</b> to the original breast specimen reconstruction, and fits were observed to be similar.

40|$|Abstract—Microwave imaging via space–time (MIST) {{beamforming}} {{has been}} proposed recently for detecting small malignant breast tumors. In this paper, we extend the previously presented two-dimensional space–time beamformer design to three-dimensional (3 -D), and demonstrate its efficacy using experimental data obtained with a multilayer <b>breast</b> <b>phantom.</b> The <b>breast</b> <b>phantom</b> consists of a homogeneous normal breast tissue simulant covered by {{a thin layer of}} skin simulant. A small synthetic malignant tumor is embedded in the <b>breast</b> <b>phantom.</b> We have developed several tumor simulants that yield the range of dielectric contrasts between normal and malignant tissue that are expected in clinical scenarios. A microwave sensor comprised of a synthetic planar array of compact ultrawide-band (UWB) antennas is immersed in a coupling medium above the <b>breast</b> tissue <b>phantom.</b> At each position in the array, the antenna transmits a synthetically generated pulse (1 – 11 GHz) into the phantom. The received backscatter signals are processed by a data-adaptive algorithm that removes the artifact caused by antenna reverberation and backscatter from the skin–breast interface, followed by 3 -D space–time beamforming to image backscattered energy as a function of location. Our investigation includes a numerical (finite difference time domain) and experimental study of the UWB antenna performance in the immersion medium, as well as a study of the influence of malignant-to-normal breast tissue dielectric contrast on dynamic range requirements and tumor detectability.

40|$|Aim of {{research}}: This research {{aimed to}} design and develop a synthetic anthropomorphic <b>breast</b> <b>phantom</b> with cancer mimicking lesions and use this phantom to assess the relationship between lesion visibility and breast thickness in mammography. Due {{to the risk of}} cancer induction {{associated with the use of}} ionising radiation on breast tissues, experiments on human breast tissue was not practical. Therefore, a synthetic anthropomorphic <b>breast</b> <b>phantom</b> with cancer mimicking lesions was needed to be designed and developed in order to provide a safe platform to evaluate the relationship between lesion visibility and breast thickness in mammography. Method: As part of this research custom Polyvinyl alcohol (PVAL) <b>breast</b> <b>phantoms</b> with embedded PVAL lesions doped with contrast agent were fabricated and utilised. These <b>breast</b> <b>phantoms</b> exhibited mechanical and X-ray properties which were similar to female breast/breast cancer tissues. In order for this research to be useful for human studies, patient safety factors have constrained the extent of this research. These factors include compression force and radiation dose. After acquiring mammograms of phantoms with varying thicknesses, the image quality of the embedded lesions were evaluated both perceptually and mathematically. The two-alternative forced choice (2 AFC) perceptual method was used to evaluate image quality of the lesions. For mathematical evaluation the following methods were utilised: line profile analysis, contrast-to noise ratio (CNR), signal-to noise ratio (SNR) and figure of merit (FOM). Results: The results of the visual perception analysis of the mammograms demonstrate that as breast compressed thickness reduces the image quality increases. Additionally, the results display a correlation in the reduction in the level of noise with the reduction in breast thickness. This noise reduction was also demonstrated in the profile plots of the lesions. The line profile analysis, in agreement with visual perception, shows improvement of sharpness of the lesion edge in relation to the reduction of the phantom thickness. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) has shown a great consistency and agreement among the observers for visibility, sharpness, contrast and noise. The ICC results are not as conclusive for the size criterion. Mathematical evaluation results also show a correlation of improvement in the image quality with the reduction in breast thickness. The results show that for the measures CNR, SNR, and FOM, the increase in image quality has a threshold after which the image quality ceases to improve and instead begins to reduce.

Conclusion: We evaluated the potential of NIRF imaging applications for BCS. The clinical setting was simulated by exploiting tissue-like <b>breast</b> <b>phantoms</b> with fluorescent tumour-like agarose inclusions. From this evaluation, we conclude that intraoperative NIRF imaging is feasible and may improve BCS by providing the surgeon with imaging information on tumour location, margin status, and presence of residual disease in real-time. Clinical studies are needed to further validate these results...|$|R
