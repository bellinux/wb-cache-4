40|$|ABSTRACT: Spiropyran (SP) mechanophore was synthe-sized {{into the}} soft or hard phase of {{segmented}} polyurethanes (SPU) and used as a molecular probe of force and orientation. Upon either tensile stretching or irradiation with UV light the SP-linked <b>segmented</b> <b>polyurethane</b> (SP-SPU) adopt a deep purple coloration and are fluorescent, demonstrating the force and UV-induced formation of the open merocyanine (MC) form of the mechanophore.

40|$|Silk-inspired <b>segmented</b> <b>polyurethanes</b> {{containing}} flexible, hydrophilic segments with crystalline {{and liquid}} crystalline moieties {{were developed to}} mimic the hierarchical morphology of the continuous domain in and the superior mechanical properties of native spider silk. A series of polyurethane elastomers were designed with varying poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) -containing soft segment lengths and hard segment contents. The incorporation of a hydrophobic poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) block and longer soft segment lengths (1900 g/mol) induced {{a higher degree of}} micro-phase segregation compared to PEO (1000 g/mol) soft <b>segment</b> <b>polyurethanes</b> of similar hard <b>segment</b> content. <b>Segmented</b> <b>polyurethanes</b> with longer PEO soft segment lengths (4600 g/mol) exhibited a lamellar morphology, which was driven by the high level of crystallinity in both the hard and soft domains. As the hard segment content (26 - 47 wt%) was increased, the crystallinity of the hard domains was enhanced, yielding a shift in the morphology of the continuous domain from soft segment continuous to hard segment continuous or an interconnected microstructure. The mechanical behavior of these systems was affected by the continuous domain morphology. Hysteresis and initial moduli increased, and extensibility decreased as the hard segment size was varied from 26 to 47 wt% in the PEO-PPO-PEO-containing polyurethanes. The pure PEO (1000 g/mol) soft <b>segment</b> <b>polyurethane</b> exhibited enhanced extensibility, tensile strength, and toughness compared to the PEO-PPO-PEO <b>segmented</b> <b>polyurethanes,</b> which was attributed to the presence of load-bearing crystallites. (cont.) Shearing of the highly ordered and hydrogen-bonded hard domains resulted in orientation of the hard blocks at a preferential angle (± 70 ⁰) to the stretch direction during tensile deformation. Strong alignment and strain-induced birefringence of the soft segment chains was identified in the pure PEO 1000 soft <b>segment</b> <b>polyurethane,</b> which supported the observed mechanical behavior. An ordered mesophase was observed in the PEO-PPO-PEO soft <b>segment</b> <b>polyurethane</b> in which the soft block formed the continuous domain. The hard segments aligned ± 30 Ì to the elongation direction within the hard domain {{as a result of the}} hydrogen-bonded network structure. Dramatic reductions ([approx. ] 16 -fold decrease in toughness and [approx] 6 -fold decrease in extensibility) in mechanical properties were found in PEO-PPO-PEO soft segment polyurethane/Laponite nanocomposites. The soft segment mobility was restricted in these nanocomposites, diminishing the ability for strain-induced ordering and hindering slippage of the soft segment chains during deformation. Regions of exfoliated Laponite alternated with intercalated-and-flocculated clay regions. These findings were rationalized in terms of preferential attraction of the hydrophilic, PEO-based soft block to the hydrophilic Laponite discs, leading to the intercalated-and-flocculated structures. However, the Laponite particles also interact with the polar hard domains, which has been assigned to the observed exfoliation. Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) -PEO-PBLG copolymers were developed using custom-synthesized, diamine-terminated PEO 1000. (cont.) These copolymers exhibited both alpha-helix and beta-sheet conformations, depending on the PBLG block length.

In wide-angle X-ray diffraction, the diffraction pattern at about 10 Å became sharper with increasing (NCO) /(OH), that is the blockness of hardsegment, suggesting that some short range ordering of this dimension is caused by hard segmnts. The weak diffractions at 3. 83 Å and 5. 06 Å appearing in EDA, TMDA, HMDA series, which is originated from the introduction of methylene sequences showed the same trend. DSC results revealed the crystallization of soft polyether segment. In PTMG 1000 series, as the hard segment content was increased, main dispersion peak of tanδ shifted to higher temperatures, decreased in its height, and broadened. In PTMG 2000 series, however, the height of tanδ peak increased.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of new <b>segmented</b> <b>polyurethanes</b> containing different amounts of N,N-diethylaminoethyl-N- 2, 2 hydroxymethylpropionamide, {{and able to}} bind, after, suitable quaternization, high amounts of heparin, is described. The quaternization is carried out on organic solutions of the polymers. Polymers have been characterized by spectroscopic techniques, molecular weight measurements and differential scanning calorimetry. The heparin content of the polymer films was determined by a colorimetric system, and its biological activity was evaluated in vitro by activated thromboplastin time (APTT) measurements. The distribution of heparin {{on the surface and}} in bulk of the heparinized films was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|The two {{series of}} the <b>segmented</b> <b>polyurethanes,</b> namely, 2, 4 -toluylendiamine, 2, 4 -toluylendiisocyanate, polyidethylenglycoladipinate and 4, 4 '-diphenylmethanediisocyanate, 1, 4 -butandiol,polyethylenbutylenglycoladipinat were being investigated. The dependences of {{temperatures}} of glassing, the energies of activation of the segmental mobility of the flexible units, {{and the degree of}} segregation of the composition have been established. The two stages of the processes of segregation, connected with the existence of physical joints of types, have been detected. The new methods for the investigation of the heterogenous polymers morphology have been developed. For the first time, experimentally detected and theoretically described has been a dipole echo, appearing in the standard three-pulse experiments NMRAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|<b>Segmented</b> <b>polyurethanes</b> {{containing}} azo aromatic {{groups in}} the main chain were synthesized by reaction of 3, 3 '-azobis(6 -hydroxybenzoic acid) (ABHB), 5 -[4 -(hydroxyphenyl) azo] salicylic acid (HPAS), and 5 -[1 -hydroxynaphthyl) azo] salicylic acid (HNAS) with hexamethylenediisocyanate (HDI). All synthesized monomers and polymers were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, 1 H-NMR spectra, TGA and DSC analysis. All the synthesized azo polymers showed good thermal stability and the onset decomposition temperature of all these polymers {{was found to be}} above 195 ºC under nitrogen atmosphere. The release of 5 -ASA under physiological conditions (pH = 7. 8 and pH = 1. 5) was investigated at body temperature (37 ºC). The release rate of 5 -ASA increased with increasing pH (i. e., 7. 8 > 1. 5) ...|$|R
