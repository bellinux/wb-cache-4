5000|$|A <b>surge</b> <b>arrester</b> is {{a device}} to protect {{electrical}} equipment from over-voltage transients caused by external (lightning) or internal (switching) events. Also called a surge protection device (SPD) or transient voltage surge suppressor (TVSS), this class of device is used to protect equipment in power transmission and distribution systems. (For consumer equipment protection, different products called surge protectors are used.) The energy criterion for various insulation material can be compared by impulse ratio, the <b>surge</b> <b>arrester</b> should have a low impulse ratio, so that a surge incident on the <b>surge</b> <b>arrester</b> may be bypassed to the ground instead of passing through the apparatus.|$|E
50|$|To {{protect a}} unit of {{equipment}} from transients occurring on an attached conductor, a <b>surge</b> <b>arrester</b> {{is connected to the}} conductor just before it enters the equipment. The <b>surge</b> <b>arrester</b> is also connected to ground and functions by routing energy from an over-voltage transient to ground if one occurs, while isolating the conductor from ground at normal operating voltages. This is usually achieved through use of a varistor, which has substantially different resistances at different voltages.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, the {{zinc oxide}} <b>surge</b> <b>arresters</b> (ZnO) {{are widely used}} in power systems, however, {{a large number of}} silicon carbide <b>surge</b> <b>arresters</b> (SiC) are still in service in the utilities.

Each thyristor tower contains a complete twelve-pulse branch of the static inverter. In these thyristor towers, for each valve function, four thyristor modules are used, which are arranged in two floors. Between the thyristor modules of a floor, there is a coil with an iron core. Parallel to the thyristor modules of a floor, there is a capacitator. Parallel to each valve function, there is a <b>surge</b> <b>arrester</b> {{in the form of}} a varistor.|$|E
50|$|Under certain {{circumstances}} the {{vacuum circuit breaker}} can force the current in the circuit to zero, before the natural zero and reversal of current in the alternating current circuit. Additionally, if the timing of interrupter operation is unfavorable {{with respect to the}} ac voltage waveform, when the arc has extinguished but the contacts are still moving and ionization has not yet dissipated in the interrupter, the applied voltage may exceed the withstand voltage of the gap. This can cause reignition of the arc and abrupt transient currents. In either of these cases, oscillations are introduced in the system, and may result in significant overvoltage. Manufacturers of vacuum interrupters address these concerns by selection of contact materials and contact designs selected to minimize current chopping. To protect apparatus from overvoltages, vacuum switchgear assemblies will usually include <b>surge</b> <b>arrester</b> components to prevent damaging over voltage.|$|E

40|$|Metal oxide <b>surge</b> <b>arresters</b> protect {{electric}} power systems from overvoltages. The conventional design of metal oxide <b>surge</b> <b>arresters</b> includes {{a stack of}} metal oxide varistors and a housing, either a porcelain hollow core insulator or a polymer hollow compound insulator. However, the progress in the polymer technology makes designs possible which are simpler and more cost effective.

5000|$|The pole may be {{grounded}} {{with a heavy}} bare copper or copper-clad steel wire running down the pole, attached to the metal pin supporting each insulator, and at the bottom connected to a metal rod driven into the ground. Some countries ground every pole while others only ground every fifth pole and any pole with a transformer on it. This provides a path for leakage currents {{across the surface of}} the insulators to get to ground, preventing the current from flowing through the wooden pole which could cause a fire or shock hazard. [...] It provides similar protection in case of flashovers and lightning strikes. A <b>surge</b> <b>arrester</b> (also called a lightning arrester) may also be installed between the line (ahead of the cutout) and the ground wire for lightning protection. The purpose of the device is to conduct extremely high voltages present on the line directly to ground.|$|E
50|$|Without {{very thick}} insulation, which is {{generally}} cost prohibitive, most conductors running more than a minimal distance, say greater than about 50 feet, will experience lightning-induced transients at some time during use. Because the transient is usually initiated at some point between the two ends of the conductor, most applications install a <b>surge</b> <b>arrester</b> just before the conductor lands in each piece of equipment to be protected. Each conductor must be protected, as each will have its own transient induced, and each SPD must provide a pathway to earth to safely divert the transient away from the protected component. The one notable exception where they are not installed at both ends is in high voltage distribution systems. In general, the induced voltage {{is not sufficient to}} do damage at the electric generation end of the lines; however, installation at the service entrance to a building is key to protecting downstream products that are not as robust.|$|E

Electric distribution networks are particularly vulnerable to lightning strokes. A single stroke to a distribution line can be sufficient to cause a blackout throughout a feeder. To prevent this, power systems are protected with lightning rods, ground wires and surge arresters. This project purpose is to study and analysis the effect of lightning and <b>surge</b> <b>arrester</b> in power distribution system. Lightning surge is modeled using equation and will be use to analyze its effect to system. When fast front transients, such as from lightning, are to be investigated, the MOV <b>surge</b> <b>arrester</b> behavior representation is significantly different.

40|$|Lightning is a {{major problem}} in a {{transmission}} line system. Lightning which occurs around the world will give a huge effect on electrical transmission system and also on distribution system division. Lightning-strike commonly generated in two different ways. One of the ways is direct strike to a wire shield (tower top) and another way is shielding failure. A direct-strike to the wire shield generates back flashover as a result of voltage on insulator string magnitude is equal or exceeds the critical flashover voltage (CFO). Therefore, the insulation of <b>surge</b> <b>arrester</b> on transmission line is the way to reducing and finally solving the back flashover problem.

40|$|AbstractThe {{beneficiary}} of Offshore Wind Farms (OWF) to land wind {{farms in the}} sense of more power productivity and land view disturbance leads to more investment and consideration. Nevertheless, the maintenance of OWFs is a significant issue due to accessibility and repair costs. Thus, the protection of OWFs electrical components should be investigated in various operation conditions such as energization, deenergization as well as lightning strikes to the blade of wind turbines. In this paper, the overvoltages due to energization are simulated and the impact of <b>surge</b> <b>arresters</b> and capacitive filters to protect wind turbine components is analyzed. Modeling of the components in OWF is considered based upon their frequency behavior. The significant components for energization studies are interconnecting cables, Wind Turbine Transformers (WTTs), <b>surge</b> <b>arresters,</b> vacuum circuit breakers as well. For modeling the cables, JMarti model is applied and model frequency is modified based on cable length.
