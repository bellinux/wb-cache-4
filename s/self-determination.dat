5|$|In {{response}} to the referendum, aboriginal peoples in Quebec strongly affirmed their own right to <b>self-determination.</b> First Nations chiefs said that forcing their peoples to join an independent Quebec without their consent would violate international law, violating their rights to <b>self-determination.</b> Aboriginal groups also demanded to be full participants in any new constitutional negotiations resulting from the referendum.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia {{interprets the}} <b>self-determination</b> clause (Article 1) {{within the context}} of other {{international}} law and as not applying to peoples within a sovereign nation-state.|$|E
5|$|Member {{nations of}} the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), {{consistently}} voted against the General Assembly resolutions calling for <b>self-determination</b> in East Timor.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after these}} events, Russia {{experienced}} the February Revolution, which brought to power a liberal Russian Provisional Government. As {{a consequence of}} these, the whole transfer project was delayed, but the Russian acceptance of <b>self-determination</b> facilitated renewed political action. According to veteran Simion Gocan, the soldiers were inspired by both these revolutionary promises and the American entry into World War I, which seemingly made Wilsonian <b>Self-Determination</b> an official Entente policy.|$|E
5|$|Thailand {{interprets the}} right to <b>self-determination</b> within the {{framework}} of other international law.|$|E
5|$|Bangladesh {{interprets the}} <b>self-determination</b> clause in Article 1 as {{applying}} {{in the historical}} context of colonialism. It also reserves the right to interpret the labour rights in Articles 7 and 8 and the non-discrimination clauses of Articles 2 and 3 {{within the context of}} its constitution and domestic law.|$|E
5|$|During the {{revolution}} of 1918â€“1919, the name 'Wilsonov' or 'Wilsonstadt' (after President Woodrow Wilson) was proposed by American Slovaks, as he supported national <b>self-determination.</b> The name Bratislava, {{which had been}} used only by some Slovak patriots, became official in March 1919.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Hitler and Mussolini {{resolved}} {{the problem of}} <b>self-determination</b> of Germans and maintaining the Brenner Pass frontier by an agreement in which German South Tyroleans were given the choice of either assimilation into Italian culture, or leave South Tyrol for Germany; most opted to leave for Germany.|$|E
5|$|Jersey is a self-governing {{parliamentary}} democracy under a constitutional monarchy, {{with its own}} financial, legal and judicial systems, {{and the power of}} <b>self-determination.</b> The Lieutenant Governor on the island is the personal representative of the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Legal expert Roger S. Clark {{notes that}} Indonesia's {{invasion}} and occupation violated two {{key elements of}} international law: the right to <b>self-determination</b> and the prohibition on aggression.|$|E
5|$|Pi de les Tres Branques, as {{a symbol}} of the united Catalan Countries, or simply of Catalan <b>self-determination,</b> has been the site of large {{political}} rallies since the turn of the 20th century, at first sporadically, but annually since 1980.|$|E
5|$|The States Parties to {{the present}} Covenant, {{including}} those having responsibility for the administration of Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories, shall promote {{the realization of the}} right of <b>self-determination,</b> and shall respect that right, in conformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|The new right-wing Front National (FN) party {{formed in}} December 2013 {{promotes}} separatism and Afrikaner <b>self-determination.</b> Hannes Engelbrecht is their leader and Dan Roodt is their deputy leader and spokesperson.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} {{increase in}} international attention to <b>self-determination</b> {{and human rights}} put further pressure on Indonesia. Subsequent events within East Timor in the 1990s helped to dramatically raise the international profile of East Timor, which in turn significantly boosted {{the momentum of the}} resistance groups.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{no longer}} called for the {{separation}} of black people from white people, MalcolmX continued to advocate black nationalism, which he defined as <b>self-determination</b> for the African-American community. In {{the last months of}} his life, however, MalcolmX began to reconsider his support for black nationalism after meeting northern African revolutionaries who, to all appearances, were white.|$|E
5|$|In an {{appearance}} before King Philip II, he obtained a royal decree ordering the holding a referendum in the Philippines towards political <b>self-determination.</b> It {{took place in}} 1599. The people chose {{to be under the}} sovereignty and protection of the monarch. This event was the only plebiscite known in the entire colonial history before the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Major {{investment}} by the Indonesian government to improve East Timor's infrastructure, {{and health and}} education facilities since 1975, did not end East Timorese resistance to Indonesian rule. Although by the 1980s Fretilin forces had dropped to a few hundred armed men, Fretilin increased its contacts with young Timorese especially in Dili, and an un-armed civil resistance seeking <b>self-determination</b> took shape.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} enhanced tribal <b>self-determination</b> because tribes {{could act}} {{even in the}} presence of related federal activity. They noted that Lara had been in numerous altercations with the tribal police at Spirit Lake for intoxication, spousal abuse, and resisting arrest. Only when the tribe ran out of options did it issue an exclusion order to bar him from the reservation.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{source of income}} from the lands, an {{extension}} of the Secure Rural Schools and Community <b>Self-Determination</b> Act of 2000, was last renewed in 2013 but at vastly reduced spending levels, leaving some counties scrambling to find new sources of funding. In late 2013, the United States House of Representatives was considering a bill that would resume the funding and increase timber harvests to provide additional income to the counties.|$|E
5|$|The victorious Allied Powers {{divided the}} territories {{of the former}} Austro-Hungarian empire between German Austria, Hungary and several other countries. Though the {{division}} of territories was conducted through a proclaimed principle of national <b>self-determination,</b> populations of ethnic Germans and Hungarians remained resident {{in many of these}} territories, including Czechoslovakia, Romania and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|After the 1917 October Revolution, {{the chaotic}} retreat of Russian troops from Western Armenia escalated. Bolshevik Russia and the Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Erzincan on 5 December 1917, ending the hostilities. The Soviet Russian {{government}} formally acknowledged {{the right of}} <b>self-determination</b> of the Ottoman Armenians in January 1918, but on 3 March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers, ceding Western Armenia and large areas in Eastern Europe to concentrate its forces against the Whites in the Russian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|As {{successful}} <b>self-determination</b> movements {{spread throughout}} Africa after World War II, many Mozambicans became progressively nationalistic in outlook, and increasingly {{frustrated by the}} nation's continued subservience to foreign rule. For the other side, many enculturated indigenous Africans who were fully integrated into the Portugal-ruled social organization of Portuguese Mozambique, in particular those from the urban centres, reacted to the independentist claims {{with a mixture of}} discomfort and suspicion. The ethnic Portuguese of the territory, which included most of the ruling authorities, responded with increased military presence and fast-paced development projects.|$|E
5|$|By March 1964, MalcolmX {{had grown}} disillusioned with the Nation of Islam and its leader Elijah Muhammad. Expressing many regrets about {{his time with}} them, which {{he had come to}} regard as largely wasted, he embraced Sunni Islam. After a period of travel in Africa and the Middle East, which {{included}} completing the Hajj, he also became known as el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz. He repudiated the Nation of Islam, disavowed racism and founded Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. He continued to emphasize Pan-Africanism, black <b>self-determination,</b> and black self-defense.|$|E
5|$|Egypt gained full {{independence}} {{with the}} Egyptian Revolution of 23 July 1952 in which King Farouk was overthrown {{by a group}} of officers that included Gamal Abdel Nasser, later to emerge as the sole ruler in 1954. Sayyid Abd al-Rahman visited London and met the British Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden on 11 November 1952. On 10 January 1953 the Egyptian government ratified an agreement with the Umma representatives and other pro-independence Sudanese parties that gave the Sudanese the right of <b>self-determination.</b> During a transition period no longer than three years parliamentary elections would be held and a Sudanese government formed. British and Egyptian troops and officials would leave the country and would be replaced by Sudanese.|$|E
5|$|From 1828 {{with the}} Treaty of Turkmenchay to the October Revolution in 1917, Eastern Armenia {{was part of}} the Russian Empire and partly {{confined}} to the borders of the Erivan Governorate. After the October Revolution, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin's government announced that minorities in the empire could pursue a course of <b>self-determination.</b> Following the collapse of the empire, in May 1918 Armenia, and its neighbors Azerbaijan and Georgia, declared their independence from Russian rule and each established their respective republics. After the near-annihilation of the Armenians during the Armenian Genocide and the subsequent Turkish-Armenian War, the historic Armenian area in the Ottoman Empire was overrun with despair and devastation.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, the Conservative Party {{returned}} {{to power in}} Britain, {{under the leadership of}} Winston Churchill. Churchill and the Conservatives believed that Britain's position as a world power relied on the continued existence of the empire, with the base at the Suez Canal allowing Britain to maintain its pre-eminent position in the Middle East in spite of the loss of India. However, Churchill could not ignore Gamal Abdul Nasser's new revolutionary government of Egypt that had taken power in 1952, and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that Sudan would be granted <b>self-determination</b> by 1955, with independence to follow. Sudan was granted independence on 1 January 1956.|$|E
5|$|In Pondicherry, Aurobindo {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} his spiritual and philosophical pursuits. In 1914, {{after four years of}} secluded yoga, he started a monthly philosophical magazine called Arya. This ceased publication in 1921. Many years later, he revised some of these works before they were published in book form. Some of the book series derived out of this publication were The Life Divine, The Synthesis of Yoga, Essays on The Gita, The Secret of The Veda, Hymns to the Mystic Fire, The Upanishads, The Renaissance in India, War and <b>Self-determination,</b> The Human Cycle, The Ideal of Human Unity and The Future Poetry were published in this magazine.|$|E
5|$|In modern Syria, Zenobia is {{regarded}} as a hero; her image appeared on banknotes, and in 1997 she was the subject of the television series Al-Ababid (The Anarchy). The series was watched by millions in the Arabic-speaking world. It examined the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict from a Syrian perspective, where the queen's struggle symbolized the Palestinians' struggle to gain the right of <b>self-determination.</b> Zenobia was also the subject of a biography by Mustafa Tlass, Syria's former minister of defense and one of the country's most prominent figures.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} in the protest {{movements}} were young children {{at the time of the}} invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system. They resented the repression of Timorese cultural and political life at the expense of the Indonesian, were ambivalent of Indonesian economic development, and spoke Portuguese amongst themselves, stressing their Portuguese heritage. Seeking help from Portugal for <b>self-determination,</b> they considered Indonesia an occupying force. Abroad, Fretilin's membersâ€”most notably former journalist JosÃ© Ramos-Horta (later to be Prime Minister and President)â€”pushed their cause in diplomatic forums.|$|E
5|$|The British {{launched}} two successive {{waves of}} invasion campaigns. The war {{ended with the}} signing of the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816, which ceded around one-third of Nepal's territory to the British. Furthermore, according to the treaty, Nepal had to allow {{for the establishment of a}} permanent British resident in Kathmandu, and had to forgo all <b>self-determination</b> in foreign affairs. During the war, Bhimsen Thapa served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Nepalese army; and thus he had to bear the direct responsibility of Nepalese defeat.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the invasion, Portugal cut {{diplomatic}} ties with Indonesia {{and went on to}} support UN resolutions condemning the invasion. However, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Portuguese government appeared reluctant to push the issue; American Indonesia specialist, Benedict Anderson suggests this stemmed from uncertainty at the time over its application to the European Community. Portugal's criticism mounted sharply from the mid-1980s, and due to public pressure, the country became one of the highest profile campaigners in international forums for East Timorese <b>self-determination.</b> Throughout the 1990s, Portugal took part in UN-brokered mediations with Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The testimonies {{of foreigners}} at the {{cemetery}} were quickly reported to international news organisations, and video footage of the massacre was widely broadcast internationally causing outrage. In response to the massacre, activists around the world organised in solidarity with the East Timorese, and a new urgency was brought to calls for <b>self-determination.</b> TAPOL, a British organisation formed in 1973 to advocate for democracy in Indonesia, increased its work around East Timor. In the United States, the East Timor Action Network (now the East Timor and Indonesia Action Network) was founded and soon had chapters in ten cities around the country. Other solidarity groups appeared in Portugal, Australia, Japan, Germany, Malaysia, Ireland, and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|V. I. Lenin's policy, {{the right}} of nations to <b>self-determination</b> aimed at {{preventing}} the disintegration of Russia {{during the period of}} military weakness. He assumed that in war-torn, splintering Europe, the proletariat of free nations would carry out socialist revolutions and unite with Soviet Russia later. The majority of the Finnish labor movement supported Finland's independence. The Finnish Bolsheviks, influential though few in number, favoured annexation of Finland by Russia. The question of annexation, in the aftermath of World War I, was resolved by the defeat of Red Finland and weakness of Russia.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the eponymous concept album's lyrics {{focus on}} human {{struggle}} and <b>self-determination,</b> A Beautiful Lies lyrics are more personal {{and the music}} introduces screaming vocals. The transformation that resonates throughout the album reflects the personal and artistic changes experienced by the band members {{before and during the}} creation of the record. The album widened the band's sound by combining elements from progressive rock, hard rock and emo. Such alternative rock style has been compared to bands like The Cure, U2 and The Smashing Pumpkins.|$|E
5|$|As {{the country}} {{continued}} to expand, {{the issue of}} slavery in its new territories became the dominant national issue. The Southern position was that slaves were property and therefore could be moved to the territories like all other forms of property. The 1820 Missouri Compromise provided for the admission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, preserving the Senate's equality between the regions. In 1846, the Wilmot Proviso was introduced to a war appropriations bill to ban slavery in all territories acquired in the Mexicanâ€“American War; the Proviso repeatedly passed the House, but not the Senate. The Compromise of 1850 temporarily defused the issue by admitting California as a free state, instituting a stronger Fugitive Slave Act, banning the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and allowing New Mexico and Utah <b>self-determination</b> on the slavery issue.|$|E
5|$|British {{control of}} Gibraltar enabled the Allies {{to control the}} {{entrance}} to the Mediterranean during the Second World War. It was attacked on several occasions by German, Italian and Vichy French forces, though without causing much damage. The Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco declined to join a Nazi plan to occupy Gibraltar but revived Spain's claim to the territory after the war. As the territorial dispute intensified, Spain closed its border with Gibraltar between 1969 and 1985 and communications links were severed. Spain's position was supported by Latin American countries but was rejected by Britain and the Gibraltarians themselves, who vigorously asserted their right to <b>self-determination.</b> Discussions of Gibraltar's status have continued between Britain and Spain but have not reached any conclusion.|$|E
