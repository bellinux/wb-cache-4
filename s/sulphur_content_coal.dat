Coal deposition took place in shallow marsh-swamp-lake complexes which sometimes became closed and evolved under warm climatic conditions with fluctuating humidity. These shallow lacustrine systems are closely interrelated with the terminal parts of the distributive fluvial systems which spread from the tectonically active Ebro basin margins.

40|$|The use of {{low quality}} fuels in power {{generation}} is typically motivated by a potential reduction in fuel costs or CO 2 emissions, the latter in case the fuel is based on biomass. These features make low quality fuels attractive {{at the same time}} as such fuels are usually problematic to use {{in power generation}} due to their fuel composition. One of the main issues is high temperature corrosion (HTC), caused by alkali containing chlorides and sulphates. The alkali chlorides are particularly problematic and these are formed from the alkali metals and chlorine when released during the combustion process. These chlorides form salts which are deposited on surfaces at relatively low temperatures, typically in the range 500 - 600 °C. The HTC problem is often related to combustion of biomass and it has a significant effect on the achievable thermal efficiency and/or maintenance cost of the power plant. However, when sulphur is present, the alkali metals may form sulphates instead of chlorides. Sulphate salts are typically less corrosive and are deposited at higher temperatures and the negative impact on the thermal efficiency is therefore less pronounced. The <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> in biomass is typically low compared to the content of alkali metals and chlorine. Therefore, sulphur has to be added if alkali sulphation should be significant. One option is to blend the biomass with another fuel with higher <b>sulphur</b> <b>content,</b> typically <b>coal.</b> In this way, co-combustion can increase the thermal efficiency of power plants using biomass and at the same time lower the use of fossil fuels. However, the current understanding of the chemistry related to the formation of alkali chlorides and sulphates is limited and needs to be improved for a better control of the HTC process when using low quality fuels for power generation, both in todays’ air-fired boilers as well as for future boiler technologies such as oxy-combustion...|$|R

There were conducted experimental investigations on the localization of ecologically dangerous products forming due to interaction of SCWHS with waters flowing through SCWHS damps.

Huge areas of oak woodland were cleared to feed the smelting furnaces. coal deposits were found beneath the shale and these were to form the basis of the coal mining industry in the area which lasted for over 300 years. In the mid 17th century, Christopher Wandesforde, from Yorkshire was invited to Ireland by the Lord Lieutenant and granted a large estate in Castlecomer which included the Castlecomer coalfield. The Wandesforde family were responsible for the opening up of a number of coal seams (The Old Three Foot Seam, The Jarrow Seam and The Skehana Seam). The Leinster Coalfield is centred on Castlecomer and extends into counties Laois and Carlow. The coal seams were often quite narrow but the coal itself was very high-quality anthracite with a low <b>sulphur</b> <b>content.</b> Castlecomer <b>coal</b> was sold within a twenty-mile radius of the collieries and the coal was transported by horse and cart.

Environmentally friendly fuels are regarded as very effective means to decrease emissions. With regard to diesel engines, the reduction in nitrogen oxides and particulates are major problem areas. Although the fuel influence on nox is comparatively low, the composition and parameters of diesel fuel have a big influence on particulate emissions and composition. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>content</b> is one of fuel proprieties, which has the most considerable influence on particulates. This paper describes results of the research on particulate emissions from direct-injection common- rail (DI CR) diesel vehicle fuelled with research fuels of differing <b>sulphur</b> <b>content.</b> The <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> of the research fuels varied from 2000 ppm through 350 ppm (EURO III) and 50 ppm (EURO IV limit, which will be in force in the European Community from 1 January 2005) up to less than 5 ppm. The experiment was undertaken on a passenger car with an high-speed, four-cylinder turbocharged, latest technology diesel engine with swept volume of about 2 dm 3. The experiments confirmed the distinct influence of <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> in diesel fuel on particulate emissions. Therefore, the <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> in diesel fuels should be reduced further...|$|R
