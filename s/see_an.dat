5|$|After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich {{saw that}} Austria's {{position}} in Europe {{was much more}} vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement {{over the future of}} several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to <b>see</b> <b>an</b> eventual war with France as inevitable.|$|E

In Alaska, the Simpsons <b>see</b> <b>an</b> advertisement starring Tom Hanks for a new Grand Canyon on the site of Springfield; realizing the town is endangered, Marge and the children {{want to go back to}} save it, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill him. After failing to talk Homer into it, his family eventually leave him for good. Alone, Homer is stranded on an iceberg and floats away. Homer gets closer to Springfield, able to see the dome. While observing it (using imaginary binoculars that somehow work), he hears saxophone music coming from an armored van. Homer realizes that his family is inside, and tries to rescue them by knocking the truck over with a wrecking ball. Unfortunately, the plan doesn't work, and he gets hit by the wrecking ball painfully. Bart tries to break his shackles but the truck drivers fill the compartment with tranquilizer gas, knocking the family out.|$|E
5|$|Alice {{spent her}} {{childhood}} between Darmstadt, London, Jugenheim, and Malta (where her naval officer father was occasionally stationed). Her mother {{noticed that she}} was slow in learning to talk, and became concerned by her indistinct pronunciation. Eventually, {{she was diagnosed with}} congenital deafness after her grandmother identified the problem and took her to <b>see</b> <b>an</b> ear specialist. With encouragement from her mother, Alice learned to both lip-read and speak in English and German. Educated privately, she studied French, and later, after her engagement, she learned Greek. Her early years were spent in the company of her royal relatives, and she was a bridesmaid at the marriage of George, Duke of York (later King George V) and Mary of Teck in 1893. A few weeks before her sixteenth birthday she attended the funeral of Queen Victoria in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and shortly afterward she was confirmed in the Anglican faith.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to <b>see</b> <b>an</b> option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E

5|$|Business {{declined}} {{during the}} construction and blasting of the station, with many storefronts losing business and some even being forced to close. However, starting in 2013, construction of the station has caused the value of real estate {{in the area to}} start to rise. Although the surrounding area's real estate prices had been declining since the 1990s, there had been increases in the purchases and leases of residential units around the area, causing real estate prices to rise again. On the Upper East Side, prices of real estate west of Third Avenue had historically been higher than prices east of there, but due to the subway's construction, prices of real estate east of the avenue had risen dramatically since the station's construction started. With the opening of the new station, business owners hoped to <b>see</b> <b>an</b> increase in patronage.|$|E
