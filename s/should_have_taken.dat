5|$|During this episode, {{the dogs}} had to {{interact}} with the main characters, which proved difficult. Actor Sean Bean reported that for the final scene where he has to sacrifice Lady, the animal was too scared to remain still. They had to keep rehearsing the scene until the dog felt comfortable, making a shot that <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> a few minutes about three hours long.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006 the Jerusalem District Court upheld three earlier {{arbitration}} rulings {{and ordered}} Karta to pay Akirov NIS 100 million for project delays. Akirov resumed construction {{and opened the}} mall in stages from 2007 to 2008, bringing closure to a 37-year project that normally <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> five to ten years. The 194-room Alrov Mamilla Jerusalem Hotel, anchored {{on the north side}} of the mall, opened in June 2009.|$|E
5|$|De Soto {{continued}} her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into {{the month of}} August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. The steamer Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and the steamer Nita was taken the next day for the same reason. During this month, {{wear and tear on}} the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, De Soto steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine-hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship finally took the blockade runner Montgomery, a chase Capt. Walker claimed <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build up steam pressure to a point, and De Soto managed to chase down the screw steamer Leviathan on 22 September.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{election}} as president in 1960, Kennedy chose Cooper {{to conduct a}} then-secret mission to Moscow and New Delhi to assess {{the attitudes of the}} Soviet government for the new administration. Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship. On the mission, Cooper discovered that the Soviets disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally. Cooper concluded in his report to Kennedy that there was little potential for harmonious relations with the Soviets. After meeting with Secretary Khruschev, Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and confessed that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> it even more seriously. Cooper supported Kennedy's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962, but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets if possible.|$|E
5|$|The Safety Board {{believes}} that the flight crew of Flight 405 <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> more positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin {{to look at the}} wing from a closer range. Although the Safety Board acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some contamination and might have prompted the flight crew to return to the gate. The Safety Board {{believes that}} the flight crew’s failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking on}} {{supplies}} at Las Palmas, Lucas sailed to Praia on Cape Verde, before continuing south on 29 May {{in the direction}} of the Brazilian coast, hoping to profit from favourable winds and currents. In fact, due to persistent calms, a position off the Brazilian shore was only reached on 27 June. Because of the delay, Lucas decided not to supply himself but to sail directly to the Cape. Because Lucas made no stops on his journey between Cape Verde and the Cape, the fact that his voyage took far longer than a journey of this distance <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> has surprised several authors. Historian C. Northcote Parkinson ascribed the delay, at least partially, to the poor quality of seamanship among Lucas's crews. The Batavian expeditionary force did not speak to another vessel during this time and thus had no information regarding British dispositions when it eventually reached the Cape on 26 July. They first reconnoitred Saldanha Bay, then Table Bay to the south, and eventually on 6 August they anchored in Saldanha Bay.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, the two {{armies of}} unequal {{strength}} {{faced each other}} across frozen fields fissured by ice-covered streams and ponds, which were in turn covered by snow and drifts. The snow and gloom meant that neither side {{was aware of the}} inequalities of men and artillery. Napoleon opened the engagement by sending Soult's's corps, which successfully pushed the Russian right flank back, nearly turning the Russian force. To follow up on this success, he ordered Pierre Augereau's force to attack the left center. No sooner had Augereau and VII Corps, plus St. Hilaire's division, sallied out when a sudden snow storm engulfed the battle field. In white-out conditions, Augereau's entire corps disappeared in a flurry of whirling snow. When the snow cleared, friend and foe alike discovered that the first units onto the field had wandered off course. The line of march <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> them directly to the Russian flank; have no point of reference, they had instead followed the terrain and led the entire corps parallel to the Russian line, along a V-shaped formation in which the left and center merged, and directly into the face of the Russian 70–gun batteries. The artillery, although shocked to find a French Corps advancing straight toward them, immediately opened fire, as did the Russian infantry on both sides of Augereau's corps.|$|E

25|$|The {{memorial}} {{is notable}} {{because it was}} the first national memorial erected by a national society of women. The Boston Evening Transcript criticized the memorial for being too plain for the magnificent site.

25|$|In July 2011, the UN investigative {{committee}} {{said that the}} Israeli naval blockade of Gaza was legal, but that Israel used excessive force and should have waited to enforce the blockade closer to the shoreline.

In September 2011, the UN stated that Israel used excessive force and boarded the flotilla when it was far away from the blockade zone.|$|E
25|$|The Basque pelota Complex, inaugurated in 2006, is for Jai alai, a mur à gauche, a trinquet and an {{open place}} fronton. It is the largest Basque pelota {{facility}} in Europe (2,600 seats).

25|$|According to Ardenti's theory, {{after the}} French monarchy and the Catholic Church disbanded the Templars {{on the grounds}} of heresy, some knights escaped and {{established}} cells throughout the world. These cells have been meeting at regular intervals in distinct places to pass on information about the Grail. Ultimately, these cells will reunite to rediscover the Grail's location and achieve world domination. According to Ardenti's calculations, the Templars <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> over the world in 1944; evidently the plan has been interrupted.|$|E
25|$|Note: The round six {{fixtures}} between Pakistan and India <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> {{place by}} the end of October 2016.

On 23 November 2016 the ICC Technical Committee ruled that India's Women's team had forfeited all of the matches, with the points being awarded to Pakistan. Pakistan were awarded two points for each game, with India considered to have scored 0 runs in the 50 overs of each game, with their net run rate adjusted to reflect this.|$|E

At around 19:45, she was spotted by CCTV on a bus at Tveita, heading home. She ate dinner with her family before leaving to visit another friend. Giskegjerde Schjetne started walking home from her friend's home just before midnight, which was her curfew. The walk <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> her half an hour.

25|$|By early August 1693, {{the four}} {{warships}} were sailing down the River Thames {{en route to}} Spain's northern city of Corunna. The journey to Corunna <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> two weeks, {{but for some reason}} the ships did not arrive in Spain until five months later. Worse still, the necessary legal documents had apparently failed to arrive from Madrid, so the ships were forced to wait. As months passed and the documents still did not arrive, the sailors found themselves in an unenviable position: with no money to send home to support their families and unable to find alternate sources of employment, they had become virtual prisoners in Corunna.|$|E
25|$|The first summit {{was held}} in Paris in July 2008. The second summit <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place in a non-EU country in July 2010 but the Euro-Mediterranean {{countries}} agreed to hold the summit in Barcelona on 7 June 2010, under the Spanish presidency of the EU, instead. However, on 20 May the Egyptian and French co-presidency along with Spain decided to postpone the summit, in a move which they described as being intended to give more time to the indirect talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority that had started that month. In contrast, the Spanish media blamed the postponement on the Arab threat to boycott the summit if Avigdor Lieberman, Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs, attended the Foreign Affairs conference prior to the summit.|$|E
25|$|The club's European {{campaign}} {{concluded with}} a 4–0 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur; a result that meant that Rovers failed to pick up any points during the group stage. In what was only their second competitive fixture {{since the end of}} the domestic season, Rovers had the better of the opening minutes and <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the lead after only 2 minutes, but James Paterson's effort was wrongly ruled out for offside. Steven Pienaar's first goal for Tottenham was the first goal of the match. Andros Townsend and Jermain Defoe scored Tottenham's second and third goals respectively. Although Tottenham did score a fourth goal through Harry Kane, it was Rovers who had the best of the second half, while both Jake Livermore and Carlo Cudicini were lucky to avoid red cards after bringing down Rovers players when they were through on goal. This was Michael O'Neill's final match in charge of the club.|$|E
