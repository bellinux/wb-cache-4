The APT-A is to be utilized as a screening device {{to assist in the}} identification of possible problem substance users and to facilitate the development of individualized treatment plans. The usefulness of this instrument will be found in the accuracy of its assignment of individuals to either the problem or no problem group. The specific population explored for the current study was high school students. The APT-A is a 51 item, six scale, self-report questionnaire that was designed specifically to assess possible adolescent problem substance use from affective, cognitive, physical, familial and social perspectives. The APT-A was administered, in three separate studies, to a multiracial sample of adolescents (999) ranging in age from 13 - 19. There was {{a significant difference between the}} problem <b>substance</b> <b>group</b> and the no problem <b>substance</b> <b>group</b> across all three studies.

To explore their potential contributions to higher cognitive functions, we used a novel task with tachistoscopically presented (for 150 ms) pairs of meaningless figures. Healthy right-handed men judged the similarities and dissimilarities between the two figures on a visual analogue scale (VAS) in two separate runs. In a double-blind, between-subjects design, subjects were administered intravenously either 0. 2 -mg/kg naloxone or placebo 10 min prior to the task, and VAS judgments and response latencies were measured. We found a significant interaction between <b>substance</b> <b>group</b> and type of judgment: The magnitude of the similarity judgments was lower in the naloxone than in the placebo group, while dissimilarity judgments remained uninfluenced by the treatment. Reaction latencies and mood scores, assessed before and after substance administration, did not differ between the two groups, indicating that the findings did not rely on altered motor performance or motivation. We suggest that naloxone decreased the "similarity criterion" in comparative judgments, indicating its potentially modulatory effect on visual cognition.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{use of the}} {{reciprocal}} calculation procedure (RCP) to calculate workplace emergency action levels (WEALs) for accidental releases of hydrocarbon mixtures. WEALs are defined here as the concentration in air that area monitors should alarm at to pro-vide adequate warning and be sufficiently protective of health to allow at least enough time to don respiratory protective equipment (RPE) and escape. The rationale for the approach is an-alysed, and ways of defining suitable <b>substance</b> <b>group</b> guidance values (GVs) for input into the RCP are considered and compared. WEAL GVs could be based on: 33 RCP GVs (i. e. using the 33 rule), the 53 RCPGVs (i. e. using the 53 rule for calculating ceiling values), emergency exposure limits, or immediately dangerous to life or health values (IDLHs). Of these, the method of choice is to base WEAL GVs on health-based IDLH values, which were developed for emergency situations in the workplace. However, IDLHs have only been set for 11 hydro-carbons, so the choice of GVs is also informed by comparison with possible GVs based on the other approaches. Using the proposed GVs, WEALs were calculated for various hydrocarbon mixtures, {{and the way they}} vary with the composition of the mixture was examined. Also, the level of health pro...|$|E

30|$|Some {{representatives of}} per- and polyfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFASs) are highly stable organic compounds, {{due to the}} C–F bond {{being one of the}} strongest in organic chemistry [1]. Compared to hydrocarbons, PFASs have enhanced technical properties, such as a higher surface activity and better dielectric properties, and possess {{at the same time a}} higher thermal stability, an increased chemical resistance and a physiological inertness [2]. Due to these properties, PFASs are well suited for manifold applications and have been used extensively in various industrial and consumer applications since the 1950 s, e.g., impregnation of textiles, paper, hard metal plating, in paints, the production of fluoropolymers, etc. [3, 4]. During the production and life cycle of the products, a certain fraction of PFASs is inevitably emitted into the environment (e.g., [5]). Many commonly used PFASs can degrade under environmentally relevant conditions to perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), regarded as final degradation products (e.g., [6]). Besides the direct emission of PFAAs, e.g., from production and life cycle of certain fluoropolymers, indirect emissions via degradation of the precursor substances are of high relevance regarding the global emissions [7]. Also, side-chain fluorinated polymers, in particular the group of side-chain fluorotelomer-based polymers, were shown to be degraded to PFAAs under environmental conditions in the range of decades to centuries [8] and are therefore considered to be precursors. As highly persistent final degradation products of many other PFASs, PFAAs are a relevant group regarding environmental and human exposure, even though being a small <b>substance</b> <b>group</b> within the whole PFASs group, consisting of at least 3000 substances [9].|$|E
40|$|Objective: Poisoning events, {{including}} {{exposures to}} hazardous materials, can involve multiple victims. Regional poison centers often are contacted in such events involving multiple victims. Methods: We searched our poison center database over a nine-year time period for all calls involving a poisoning event {{in which more}} than two people were exposed to the same substance. We then matched each product to the generic category used by the National Poison Data System. We analyzed this data to find the most frequent substances reported as primary substances in the multiple exposures. Results: We identified 6, 695 calls between 2000 and 2008 that had more than two people exposed to the same substance. In these calls, 25, 926 people were exposed (3. 6 % of the 715, 701 human exposure calls for this period). These calls involved 64 of the 67 NPDS <b>substance</b> <b>group</b> codes. Some substances were much more commonly involved than others. The top three categories causing the most exposures were Fumes/Gases/Vapors, Food Products/Food Poisoning and Pesticides. Of the patients exposed, 69. 4 % were not followed due to minimal effects possible or judged as nontoxic, 0. 3 % had major effects, 8. 6 % had no effects, and 9. 3 % had minimal to moderate effects. Eight people expired. Conclusion: Fumes, gases, and vapors make up the majority of multi-exposure calls. The overall mortality from multi-exposures, based on our data, is low.

This study compares the use of honey with a standard bioresorbable membrane (Seprafilm tm) to prevent the formation of PIAAs in rats. METHODS: Thirty rats underwent laparotomy, and PIAAs were induced by scraping the cecum. The animals were divided into three groups, each containing ten rats. Group 1 (control) represented the cecal abrasion group, with no intraperitoneal administration of any <b>substance.</b> <b>Group</b> 2 (honey group) underwent cecal abrasion and intraperitoneal administration of honey. Group 3 (Seprafilm tm group) underwent cecal abrasion and intraperitoneal Seprafilm tm application. RESULTS: Group 1 exhibited higher adhesion scores for adhesions between the abdominal wall and the organs. Groups 2 and 3 had decreased adhesive attachments to the intra-abdominal structures. Compared to group 1, the incidence of adhesion formation was lower in both group 2 (p= 0. 001) and group 3 (p= 0. 001). The incidence of fibrosis was also lower in group 2 (p= 0. 016) and group 3 (p= 0. 063) compared to group 1. There {{was no significant difference}} between the histopathological fibrosis scores for the rats in group 2 and those in group 3 (p= 0. 688). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that both honey and Seprafilm tm decrease the incidence of PIAAs in the rat cecal abrasion model. Although the mechanism of action is not clear, intraperitoneal administration of honey reduced PIAAs. The outcome of this study demonstrates that honey is as effective as Seprafilm tm in preventing PIAAs...|$|E

40|$|A {{confirmatory method}} has been {{developed}} {{to allow for the}} analysis of eleven nitroimidazoles and also chloramphenicol in milk and honey samples. These compounds are classified as A 6 compounds in annex IV of council regulation 2377 / 90 and therefore prohibited for the use in animal husbandry. Milk samples are extracted by acetonitrile with addition of NaCl, while honey samples are first dissolved in water before a similar extraction. Honey extracts undergo a hexane wash to remove impurities. Both milk and honey extracts are evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in initial mobile phase. These are then injected onto an LC-MS/MS system and analysed in less than 9 minutes. The MS/MS is operated in MRM mode with positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The method is validated in accordance with Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC and is capable of analysing for metronidazole, dimetridazole, ronidazole, ipronidazole and there hydroxy metabolites MNZ-OH, HMMNI and IPZ-OH. The method is also able to analyse for carnidazole, ornidazole, ternidazole, tinidazole and chloramphenicol. A level of 3 μg L- 1 / μg kg- 1 (RL) for MNZ, DMZ and RNZ has been recommended by the community reference laboratory responsible for this <b>substance</b> <b>group</b> and this method can easily detect all nitroimidazoles at this level. A minimum required performance level of 0. 3 μg L- 1 / μg kg- 1 is in place for chloramphenicol which the method can also easily detect. For nitroimidazoles the decision limits (CC) and detection capabilities (CC) range from 0. 41 to 1. 55 μg L- 1 and 0. 70 to 2. 64 μg L- 1 respectively in milk and from 0. 38 to 1. 16 μg kg- 1 and 0. 66 to 1. 98 μg kg- 1 respectively in honey.

3000|$|... 'Personal Care Products'; also {{referred}} to as cosmetic products or cosmetics in the European Union (EU), contain a multitude of chemicals used for different purposes. The chemicals used to introduce certain functions in personal care products show different properties. Due to some of these properties (e.g. low water solubility) environmental behavior and effects are not easily determined. For many of these substances, ecotoxicological testing is technically not feasible or very expensive. Due to this lack of appropriate testing tools, recent research is increasingly interested in this <b>substance</b> <b>group</b> [1]. 'Poorly soluble substances', which are characterised by low water solubility (< 1 mg/l), may constitute a substantial proportion of the ingredients in some 'personal care products'. Such ingredients with essential function are used in numerous cosmetic products, e.g. as emulsifiers. The extensive usage results in high production volumes and thereby requires an assessment of the environmental behavior and the toxicity of these substances to aquatic organisms to fulfill the requirements of the European Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation. For manufacturers or importers as responsible registrants, risk assessment is necessary to demonstrate product safety for human health and the environment. At the threshold of the water solubility of the substance, toxicity tests are very difficult to conduct and cannot be performed as a matter of routine. High lipophilicity and high adsorption potential might cause an extensive adsorption of the substance to surfaces, e.g. to the test vessels or test organisms. This might complicate testing procedures, and analytical determination of the substance. As a consequence, the measured concentrations in the test solution are likely to be significantly lower than the nominal concentrations. It also raises difficulties in quantifying the substances with analytical methods because of their low concentration in the water phase. For these reasons standard tests such as the Daphnia acute immobilisation test or the algal growth inhibition test, which are required for the REACH registration, might provide insufficient results and are thereby often not appropriate for a realistic risk assessment.|$|E
