40|$|In {{a recent}} thought-provoking paper, Ball and Sheridan [Ball, L., Sheridan, N., 2005. Does {{inflation}} targeting matter? In: Bernanke, B. S., Woodford, M. (Eds.), The Inflation-Targeting Debate, University of Chicago Press] {{show that the}} available evidence {{for a group of}} developed economies does not lend credence to the belief that adopting an inflation targeting regime (IT) was instrumental in bringing inflation and inflation volatility down. Here, we extend Ball and Sheridan`s analysis for a subset of 36 emerging market economies and find that, for them, the story is quite different. Compared to non-targeters, developing countries adopting the IT regime not only experienced greater drops in inflation, but also in growth volatility, thus corroborating the view that the regime`s ""constrained flexibility"" to deal with adverse <b>shocks</b> delivered <b>concrete</b> welfare gains.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the authors}} is to model the <b>shock</b> {{response}} of <b>concrete</b> structures submitted {{to the effects of}} projectile penetration or contact detonation, in a range of pressure levels from 0 to 20 GPa. The limitations of current computers imply the need to homogenize the response of the different constituents of concrete into a single macroscopic model. Though concrete is widely used as a construction material, the knowledge concerning its response under shock loading response remains rather modest. An exhaustive review of the research effort in this field shows that the limited available data is affected by an important dispersion. As a consequence, any general rule correlating the composition of <b>concrete</b> to its <b>shock</b> properties have not yet been evidenced. A simple method to predict the <b>shock</b> Hugoniot of <b>concrete</b> based on a mixture theory is developed considering concrete as a mix of cement hydrates, free water, rock and voids. Experimental results obtained on special concrete compositions are presented. They illustrate the relation between the wave structure {{and the size of the}} aggregates, and so, the level of heterogeneity of the composition. Numerical simulations demonstrate the ability of a mesoscopic model to describe this phenomenon, and the failure of the homogenized approach to do so. 1...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{investigate}} the dynamic response of a concrete structure subjected to a mainshock–aftershock seismic sequence. In the dynamic analysis, three components of the registered mainshock and aftershock were taken into account. The peak ground accelerations of about 0. 5  g were assumed for both shocks. A one-storey shed was modelled with the ABAQUS software to represent a large concrete structure under the repeated earthquakes. For proper characterization of concrete structure behaviour under the sequence of <b>shocks,</b> a <b>concrete</b> damage plasticity model was assumed as a constitutive model of concrete. The obtained results indicate that aftershocks can have considerable effect on dynamic behaviour of concrete structures in terms of enlarging zones affected by irreversible strains or additional damage evolution. The analysis revealed that aftershocks, which are usually not as strong as mainshocks, may result even in total loss of concrete material strength while performing in mainshock–aftershock seismic sequences...|$|R

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of short fibres of titanium by melt extraction {{has been investigated}} in close collaboration of the Fraunhofer-Institutes lKTS, EPM and IWS, Dresden. The inductive melting of titanium means a complex demand on melting tanks and the refractory materials respectively. The goal of the ceramic research {{was to develop a}} crucible with a high resistance to metal corrosion and thermal <b>shock.</b> Shrinking-free <b>concretes</b> were used to fabricate the tank, which were coated by thermal spraying and/or engobing. With regard to the thermodynamic evaluations and the material expertise the coatings based on systems such as Y-Ti-O, Mg-Al-O, but also hexagonal and gas phase deposited boron nitride, TiB 2, and TiC or ZrO 2. To develop engobing it was necessary to optimize the coating procedure, the drying, and the co-firing without crack formation or spelling. The corrosion test involves the sessile drop test and the melt corrosion test by inductive heating. Thermal stresses in the wall of the tank and the formation of eutectic melts in the system CaO - Y 2 O 3 - Al 2 O 3 limit the time of the melt extraction at 1730 degrees C to 20 minutes...|$|R

The negative slope of the bilinear Hugoniot for low particle velocity regime can simulate the process that the porosity of concrete may be compressed to form <b>shock</b> wave in <b>concrete,</b> {{through a series of}} numerical analyses over the investigation on the physical phenomena. The results of particle velocity for the concrete material are also discussed to be compared with those of non-porous aluminum alloy for 100 and 1000 m/s impact velocities.

40|$|The {{effect of}} admixtures, such as {{disperse}} chamotte, microsilica, low – density liquid glass and alumina cement (Gorkal 40) on Portland cement hydration {{by measuring the}} temperature due to exothermic reaction is investigated. The admixtures differently affect Portland cement hydration: microsilica and alumina cement accelerate, while low density (1025 – 1050 kg/m 3) liquid glass retards Portland cement hydration. When {{the density of the}} liquid glass reaches 1100 kg/m 3, it accelerates the Portland cement hydration as well. Thermal shock resistance of refractory concrete with Portland cement, chamotte aggregates and various admixtures is studied. It was found that a complex admixture of disperse chamotte, microsilica and low – density liquid glass allows the thermal <b>shock</b> resistance of <b>concrete</b> to be increased, thereby indirectly demonstrating the capability of these admixtures to effectively bind CaO...|$|R
50|$|Friction bullet traps {{slow and}} capture the bullet more gently than steel plates. This allows more {{effective}} capture of contaminants {{and reduces the}} production of dust as well as allowing for the capture of higher energy projectiles which would wear an impact trap too quickly and necessitate uneconomical levels of maintenance. The {{most common form of}} friction trap is a berm of granular material such as sand; earth or granulated rubber. In some circumstances a wall of railway ties, intact vehicle tires, or blocks of <b>shock</b> attenuating <b>concrete</b> (SACON) or other proprietary materials may be used. SACON is a fiber-reinforced concrete substituting expanded polystyrene beads for gravel aggregate. For ISSF 50Metre rifle events, individual bullet traps comprising a metal box filled with plastic beads are often used behind the electronic scoring systems used for such events. Such systems require less space than earthen berms whilst being quieter than steel impact or deceleration traps, which can be a significant consideration for urban outdoor range complexes. Individual bullet traps of this nature would typically be backed by a concrete wall to protect from negligent discharges or mechanical failures causing a bullet to miss the target entirely but which is not expected to be struck during the course of normal firing. Intact vehicle tyres are generally only suitable for higher energy projectiles which will easily penetrate their surface. Handgun bullets and shotgun pellets may ricochet back. Granulated rubber (often from shredded tires) is a convenient capture material from which bullets may be separated by gravity during agitation by subsequent bullet impact.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>shock</b> {{vibration}} on <b>concrete</b> were studied using a newly developed test method that applies hammer blows to prismatic specimens in the longitudinal direction and evaluates the shortand long-term effects by observing crack formation, measuring the immediate change in ultrasonic pulse velocity, and measuring the reductions in 28 -day tensile and compressive strengths. A total of 198 prisms cast of typical concrete mixtures with 28 -day cube strength ranging from 40 to 60 MPa had been tested at ages of 12 hours to 28 days. The tests {{revealed that the}} major effect of shock vibration is the formation of transverse cracks. Based on the test results, the shock vibration resistances of the concrete mixtures at different ages were determined and correlated to their material properties. It {{was found that the}} single most important material parameter governing the shock vibration resistance of concrete is the dynamic tensile strain capacity. Finally, several new sets of vibration control limits, which are less conservative than most existing ones, have been established. Copyright © 2005, American Concrete Institute.

40|$|A {{new test}} method for {{evaluating}} the effects of <b>shock</b> vibration on <b>concrete</b> has been developed. In this method, shock vibrations are applied to prismatic specimens by hammering each specimen at one end in the longitudinal direction. During the test, the shock vibration applied is measured by using an accelerometer, from which the signals are first digitized and then analyzed to yield the peak particle velocity of the pure vibration component, taken herein as {{the intensity of the}} shock vibration. The short- and longterm effects on the concrete are examined by: 1) visual inspection of cracks; 2) ultrasonic tests conducted before and after the hammer impact; and 3) direct tension and equivalent cube strength tests of hammered and control specimens at the age of 28 days. Test results obtained thus far revealed that the major damage caused by shock vibration was the formation of cracks. Even when cracks were not observed on the surfaces, however, there could be significant reductions in ultrasonic pulse velocity and tensile strength, probably due to the formation of internal cracks not observable on the surface. On the other hand, the effect on compressive strength appeared to be relatively small. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{support of}} the {{development}} of American National Standards Institute standards for the transport of radioactive materials, Sandia has a program to characterize the normal transport environment. This program includes both analytical modeling of package and trailer responses, and over-the-road tests to measure those responses. This paper presents the results of a series of over-the-road tests performed using Chem-Nuclear equipment in the Barnwell, SC, area. The test events included a variety of road types such as rough <b>concrete,</b> <b>shock</b> events such as railroad grade crossings, and driver responses such as sharp turns. The response of the package and trailer to these events was measured with accelerometers at various locations to determine the inertial loads. Either load cells or strain gages were used to measure tiedown response. These accelerations and loads were measured on systems with flexible and ``rigid`` tiedowns. The results indicated that while significant accelerations occur on the trailer bed, these do not translate into equivalent loads in either the package or the tiedown system. This indicates that trailer-bed response should not be used in determining the load factor for fatigue calculations of the package components or in determining design loads for tiedowns...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{residual}} mechanical properties of OPC and OPC/slag concretes, exposed to either 400 or 800 ºC followed by furnace or water cooling. The heat transfer from surface to {{centre of the}} specimens maintained similar trend for all blends for both 400 and 800 ºC. After 400 ºC, OPC and OPC/slag water cooled specimens presented a further 20 % loss in the residual strength when compared with furnace cooled specimens. This additional strength decrease of 20 % is possibly due to thermal stresses caused by the thermal <b>shock</b> of the <b>concrete</b> with water at 20 ºC. After 800 ºC, all OPC/slag water cooled specimens presented further strength loss of 5 % when compared with furnace cooled specimens. However, water cooled OPC specimens presented strength loss of 14 % when compared with furnace cooled specimens, and therefore, thermal stresses cannot solely {{be the cause of}} this strength loss. At 800 ºC dehydration of Ca(OH) 2 into CaO would have taken place, followed by rehydration of CaO after cooling. Infrared spectroscopy showed that the peak intensity of Ca(OH) 2 is much higher for OPC cooled with water than for furnace cooled, suggesting rehydration of CaO is accelerated with water cooling, resulting in greater strength loss for OPC concrete exposed to 800 ºC...|$|R
