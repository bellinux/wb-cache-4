50|$|The Vatti {{clipping}} algorithm {{is used in}} computer graphics. It allows clipping of any number of arbitrarily shaped subject polygons by any number of arbitrarily <b>shaped</b> <b>clip</b> polygons. Unlike the Sutherland-Hodgman and Weiler-Atherton polygon {{clipping algorithm}}s, the Vatti algorithm does not restrict the types of polygons {{that can be used}} as subjects or clips. Even complex (self-intersecting) polygons, and polygons with holes can be processed. The algorithm is generally applicable only in 2D space.|$|E

50|$|Helical Feed loaders are {{a form of}} Force Feed loader {{which use}} helix (or coil) <b>shaped</b> <b>clips.</b> In most designs, each clip is {{preloaded}} (typically before a match begins) with paintballs which are stacked under constant pressure to ensure a continuous feed of balls into the chamber. One drawback to this pressure is that paintballs stored in the clip will become deformed over time, causing jams or inaccuracy. Using a feed tube, these loaders can be mounted under a barrel. Helical feed loaders can fire continuously in any orientation. The 'Q-Loader' system uses a spring-driven clip, eliminating the potential noise of a motor driven system. The 'Q-Loader' system is capable of loading 100 balls in less than 3 seconds, though breakage can occur at higher spring tensions.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new engineering approach to audio clipping preamplifier {{that can be}} used for the tone modification and volume control of electronic devices. The approach consists of a unique design based on a summation amplifier, Silicon Controlled Rectifiers (SCR) and RC networks that enables signal gain, improved frequency response, tone modification and signal <b>shape</b> <b>clipping.</b> The proposed summation amplifier based design produces more gain resulting in larger range of clipping effect as compared to existing methods. The response is altered to produce low bass frequencies that have been amplified based on a new configuration allowing the user to change the reactance within the summation circuitry. Also, a new technique of Silicon Controlled Rectifiers (SCR) with a variable RC network accomplishes a clipping network that adjusts the <b>shape</b> of <b>clipping</b> signal. The main advantage of the proposed amplifier is that it can generate a wide range of tonal control that to date the industry has yet to produce. The proposed method being an analog approach also addresses current drawbacks found within the digital preamplifier which fails to effectively capture the tone quality of the individual analog devices. The paper explains the design details, simulation set up including analysis, real-time testing/trouble shooting on an electric guitar and constructional details...|$|R

50|$|Automatic {{release was}} {{accomplished}} by forcing the clips sideways, against the tension of the spring. The <b>shape</b> of the <b>clip</b> and the plates meant that rotating the boot {{in relation to the}} ski would force them outwards. For instance, in a twisting motion the plate would push the clip sideways {{along the edge of the}} plate until it reached the corner, when it would release. In a direct-forward fall, the plate would lift up, acting against the angled <b>shape</b> of the <b>clips,</b> again forcing them outward and eventually releasing. The tension could be adjusted for skier weight or skill level via a large screw knob at the extreme rear, and several springs were provided for different release forces.|$|R

These two mints began production of gold cobs in 1622—the first gold coins struck in the Americas. The Cartagena mint operated sporadically, finally closing in 1655. The Bogotá mint (sometimes called the Santa Fé or the Nuevo Reino mint) continued producing gold cobs until 1756. Its production of silver cobs was very limited. The earliest known piece of eight from Bogotá is dated 1627.

40|$|We {{propose a}} real time volume {{clipping}} method which {{is capable of}} using several analytical planes for virtual clipping, in order to display internal anatomical structures within volumetric data sets. A single proxy plane is used for computation of {{the direction of a}} ray that is cast from the viewpoint. Intersections between the rays and the planes are computed on graphics process unit (GPU). The start and end points for each ray are determined by analyzing relationships with the ray direction, intersections and the normal of planes. Then the volume integral is computed along the ray from the start point to the end point. To obtain immediate visual feedback of clipping effects, we implement translation and rotation of planes on GPU to interactively change the <b>shape</b> of <b>clip</b> object. At last, several experiments were performed on a standard PC with a GeForce FX 8600 graphics card. Experimental results show that the method can freely clip and clearly visualize volumetric data sets at real time frame rates. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Macuquinas, {{also known}} as [...] "cobs", were used heavily in local {{transactions}} in America, although their poor quality produced many complaints. Water-powered roller die and punch technology, capable of making high quality, round coinage was imported to Segovia, Spain from Germany in the 1580s, yet the old Royal mint at Segovia continued to make cobs. The Potosi Mint {{was the last to}} establish this advanced technology, making cobs until 1772. The macuquina's irregular <b>shape</b> invited <b>clipping,</b> leading to ever greater numbers of coins below legal weight. Clipped coin tended to migrate at a small profit in commerce to cities in need of coin (often those preparing a fleet for sail) where hard money was accepted at, or near, face value. In 1784 (by which time all macuquinas were over a decade old), King Charles III ordered macuquina in the Indies withdrawn and reminted. The order had to be reissued in 1789, but it remained unfulfilled {{due to a lack of}} resources.|$|R

5000|$|A {{paper clip}} (or {{sometimes}} paperclip) is an instrument {{used to hold}} sheets of paper together, usually made of steel wire bent to a looped <b>shape.</b> Most paper <b>clips</b> are variations of the Gem type introduced in the 1890s or earlier, characterized by the almost two full loops made by the wire. Common to paper clips proper is their utilization of torsion and elasticity in the wire, and friction between wire and paper. When a moderate number of sheets are inserted between the two [...] "tongues" [...] of the clip, the tongues will be forced apart and cause torsion in the bend of the wire to grip the sheets together.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of {{volumetric}} features for action recognition. First, we propose a novel method to correlate spatio-temporal <b>shapes</b> to video <b>clips</b> that have been automatically segmented. Our method works on oversegmented videos, which means {{that we do not}} require background subtraction for reliable object segmentation. Next, we discuss and demonstrate the complementary nature of shape- and flow-based features for action recognition. Our method, when combined with a recent flow-based correlation technique, can detect a wide range of actions in video, as demonstrated by results on a long tennis video. Although not specifically designed for whole-video classification, we also show that our method’s performance is competitive with current action classification techniques on a standard video classification dataset. 1...|$|R

People who view her balls and pins are assaulted by visions of the people they have wronged. It is shown that she turns her sacrifices into bowling balls (she actually orders her sacrifices based on their weight, so that the ball's weight is more comfortable for her to throw), but it is unknown as to whether or not this also applies to the pins.

40|$|Using {{combinations}} of different volumetric datasets {{is becoming more}} common in scientific applica-tions, especially medical environments such as neu-rosurgery where multiple imaging modalities are re-quired to provide insight to both anatomical and functional structures in the brain. Such data sets are usually in different orientations and have differ-ent resolutions. Furthermore, it is often interesting, e. g. for surgical planning or intraoperative appli-cations to add the visualization of foreign objects (e. g., surgical tools, reference grids, 3 D measure-ment widgets). We propose a flexible framework based on GPU-accelerated ray-casting and depth peeling, that allows volume rendering of multi-ple, arbitrarily positioned volumes intersected with opaque or translucent geometric objects. These ob-jects {{can also be used}} as convex or concave <b>clipping</b> <b>shapes.</b> We consider the main contribution of our work to be the flexible combination of the above-mentioned features in a single framework. As such, it can serve as a basis for neurosurgery applications but also for other fields where multi-volume render-ing is important. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{extension}} allows {{defining the}} shape of two separate regions: the clipping and the bounding regions. These two areas are defined even for windows not using the <b>shape</b> extension: the <b>clipping</b> region is the area {{that can be used}} for drawing, the bounding region is the total area covered by the window (that is, the clipping region plus the border). The shape extension allows defining two independent shapes for these two regions. Both the clipping and bounding are associated, in the shape extension, two areas: a default rectangular region and a possibly non-rectangular client region, defined and changed by the client as specified above. The effective region, which is the actual shape of the window, is the intersection of these two areas. This intersection is performed every time either region is changed: for example, if the client regions contains parts that are outside the default region but the default region is then enlarged, the effective region will include these parts.|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an {{interactive}} method of model clipping for computer-assisted surgical planning. The model is {{separated by a}} data filter that {{is defined by the}} implicit function of the clipping path. Being interactive to surgeons, the clipping path that is composed of the plane widgets can be manually repositioned along the desirable presurgical path, which means that surgeons can produce any accurate <b>shape</b> of the <b>clipped</b> model. The implicit function is acquired through a recursive algorithm based on the Boolean combinations (including Boolean union and Boolean intersection) of a series of plane widgets' implicit functions. The algorithm is evaluated as highly efficient because the best time performance of the algorithm is linear, which applies to most of the cases in the computer-assisted surgical planning. Based on the above stated algorithm, a user-friendly module named SmartModelClip is developed on the basis of Slicer platform and VTK. A number of arbitrary clipping paths have been tested. Experimental results of presurgical planning for three types of Le Fort fractures and for tumor removal demonstrate the high reliability and efficiency of our recursive algorithm and robustness of the module...|$|R
40|$|Predicting anopheles vectors’ {{population}} densities and boundary shifts {{is crucial}} in preparing for malaria risks and unanticipated outbreaks. Although shifts in the distribution and boundaries of the major malaria vectors (Anopheles gambiae s. s. and An. arabiensis) across Africa have been predicted, quantified areas of absolute change in zone of suitability for their survival have not been defined. In this study, we have quantified areas of absolute change conducive for the establishment and survival of these vectors, per African country, under two climate change scenarios and based on our findings, highlight practical measures for effective malaria control {{in the face of}} changing climatic patterns. We develop a model using CLIMEX simulation to estimate the potential geographical distribution and seasonal abundance of these malaria vectors in relation to climatic factors 9 temperature, rainfall and relative humidity). The model yielded an eco climatic index (EI) describing the total favorable geographical locations for the species. The EI value were classified and exposed to a GIS package. Using ArcGIS, the EI <b>shape</b> points <b>clipped</b> to the extent of Africa and then converted to a raster layer using inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method. Generated maps wre then transformed into polygon-based geo-referenced data set and areas computed and expressed in square kilometers (km 2). Five classes of EI were derived indicating the level of survivorship of these malaria vectors. The proportion of areas increasing or decreasing in level of survival of these malaria vectors will be more pronounced in eastern and southern African countries than those in western Africa. Angola, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, South Africa and Zambia appear most likely to be affected in terms of absolute change of malaria vectors suitability zones under the selected climate change scenarios. The potential shifts of these malaria vectors have implications for human exposure to malaria, as recrudescence of the disease is likely to be recorded in several new areas and regions. Therefore, the need to develop, compile and share malaria preventive measures, which can be adapted to different climatic scenarios, remains crucial. ...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{solid state}} {{circuitry}} controlled by an SDK- 85 microcomputer {{forms the basis}} of a digitally controlled Fourier synthesizer module. The hardware involved in this module is the major thrust of this particular research work. Ultimately, once properly machine programmed, the microcomputer will control the base frequency, the number of harmonics present in the output waveshape, and the relative amplitudes and phases of these harmonics. The first phase of the hardware interface entails the conversion of square waves (from 8253 timers via the microcomputer) to triangle waveforms (via LM 741 integrators). The triangle waves are then sine <b>shaped</b> by special <b>clipping</b> circuitry. It is the resultant sine waves that are then digitally controlled by machine software. The first stage of the above process eliminates the problem of frequency dependence and gain dropoff of the LM 741 operational amplifiers. The relative amplitude of the triangle wave output of the LM 741 is compensated for such that the sine shaping circuitry receives a constant amplitude waveform. The second phase of the hardware interface uses digital control of the final sine waveform by means of a Voltage Controlled Amplifier (VCA) and a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC). The VCA acts as the actual interface between the computer and the module. Finally, the output of the VCA'a are mixed and sent through an audio amplifier or to an oscilloscope for user inspection.

40|$|Atherosclerosis is a multifactoral {{inflammatory}} disease {{that occurs in}} predisposed locations in the vasculature where blood flow is disturbed. In vitro studies have implicated reactive oxygen species as mediators of mechanotransduction leading to inflammatory protein expression and ultimately atherogenesis. While these cell culture-based studies have provided enormous insight into the effects of WSS on endothelial biology, the applicability to the in vivo setting is questionable. We hypothesized that low magnitude oscillatory WSS acts through reactive oxygen species (ROS) to increase expression of inflammatory cell adhesion molecules leading {{to the development of}} atherosclerotic lesions. The overall objective for this thesis was to develop an in vivo flow model that produces low magnitude oscillatory WSS which could be used to investigate the in vivo molecular mechanisms of mechanotransduction. We created a novel aortic coarctation model using a <b>shape</b> memory nitinol <b>clip.</b> The clip reproducibly constricts the aorta creating a narrowing of the lumen resulting in a stenosis. This mechanical constraint produces a region of flow separation downstream from the coarctation. We have characterized the coarctation in terms of the efficacy, pressure loss, and fluid dynamics. We then measured the endothelial response of shear sensitive redox and inflammatory markers. Lastly, we utilized genetically modified mice and mice treated with pharmacological inhibitors to investigate the mechanisms involved in the expression of WSS induced inflammatory and redox markers. We found that inducing a coarctation of the aorta using a nitinol clip uniquely created a hemodynamic environment of low magnitude oscillatory WSS without a significant change in blood pressure. Using this model we found that the in vivo endothelial phenotype associated with acutely disturbed flow was characterized by increased production of superoxide and increased expression of select inflammatory proteins. In comparison, the phenotype associated with chronically disturbed flow was characterized by a more modest increase in superoxide and increased levels of multiple inflammatory proteins. We determined that in regions of acutely disturbed flow in vivo, VCAM- 1 expression was not modulated by reactive oxygen species. Additionally, p 47 phox-dependent NADPH Oxidase activity does not have a functional role in WSS induced superoxide generation in the endothelium. In summary, we have created a novel murine model of low magnitude oscillatory WSS {{that can be used to}} investigate the in vivo molecular mechanisms associated with atherogenesis. While previous data obtained in vitro indicated that depletion of an individual ROS was sufficient to inhibit flow-induced inflammatory protein expression, our findings, to the contrary, showed that antioxidant treatment in vivo does not inhibit shear-dependent inflammatory protein expression. Our results suggest that atherogenesis in the in vivo environment is significantly more complicated than the in vitro environment and that parallel pathways and compensatory mechanisms are likely activated in vivo in response to WSS. These results could have significant implications in the efficacy of antioxidant treatment of atherosclerosis and could explain the complexity of results observed in clinical trials. Ph. D.
