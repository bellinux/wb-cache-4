5|$|Four batters hit for {{the cycle}} {{in the same}} season in which they won the Triple Crown: Nap Lajoie (American League) in 1901; Jimmie Foxx (American League) and Chuck Klein (National League) in 1933; and Lou Gehrig (American League) in 1934. Gehrig is the only player to {{complete}} the MLB Triple Crown in his cycle-hitting season, leading both the National and American Leagues in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in. When Foxx and Klein won in the same season, each was playing for a team in Philadelphia: Klein for the Phillies and Foxx for the Athletics. Three players – John Olerud, Michael Cuddyer, and Bob Watsonhave hit for the cycle in both the National and American Leagues. Family pairs to hit for the cycle include father and son Gary and Daryle Ward, who accomplished the feat in 1980 and 2004, respectively; and grandfather and grandson Gus and David Bell, the elder of whom hit for the cycle in 1951, and the younger in 2004. Leon Culberson, on July 3, 1943, became the last player <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> hit for the cycle with his home run coming on an inside-the-park home run.|$|E
5|$|All genes known <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> {{be linked}} to HHT code for {{proteins}} in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This {{is a group of}} proteins that participates in signal transduction of hormones of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily (the transforming growth factor beta, bone morphogenetic protein and growth differentiation factor classes), specifically BMP9/GDF2 and BMP10. The hormones do not enter the cell but link to receptors on the cell membrane; these then activate other proteins, eventually influencing cellular behavior {{in a number of ways}} such as cellular survival, proliferation (increasing in number) and differentiation (becoming more specialized). For the hormone signal to be adequately transduced, a combination of proteins is needed: two each of two types of serine/threonine-specific kinase type membrane receptors and endoglin. When bound to the hormone, the type II receptor proteins phosphorylate (transfer phosphate) onto type I receptor proteins (of which Alk-1 is one), which in turn phosphorylate a complex of SMAD proteins (chiefly SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8). These bind to SMAD4 and migrate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the transcription of particular genes. In addition to the SMAD pathway, the membrane receptors also act on the MAPK pathway, which has additional actions on the behavior of cells. Both Alk-1 and endoglin are expressed predominantly in endothelium, perhaps explaining why HHT-causing mutations in these proteins lead predominantly to blood vessel problems. Both ENG and ACVRL1 mutations lead predominantly to underproduction of the related proteins, rather than misfunctioning of the proteins.|$|E
