50|$|OpenStack Networking {{provides}} networking {{models for}} different applications or user groups. Standard models include flat networks or VLANs that separate servers and traffic. OpenStack Networking manages <b>IP</b> <b>addresses,</b> allowing for dedicated <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> or DHCP. Floating <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> let traffic be dynamically rerouted to any {{resources in the}} IT infrastructure, so users can redirect traffic during maintenance or {{in case of a}} failure.|$|R
50|$|The {{configuration}} of a <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> depends in detail on the software or hardware {{installed in the}} computer. Computers used for the network infrastructure, such as routers and mail servers, are typically configured with static addressing, Static addresses are also sometimes convenient for locating servers inside an enterprise.|$|E
50|$|Non-commercial whitelists are {{operated}} by various non-profit organisations, ISPs and others interested in blocking spam. Rather than paying fees the sender must pass {{a series of}} tests; for example, his email server must not be an open relay and have a <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address.</b> The operator of the whitelist may remove a server from the list if complaints are received.|$|E
5000|$|... ==IP address {{assignment}} == IP addresses {{are assigned to}} a host either dynamically {{at the time of}} booting, or permanently by fixed configuration of the host hardware or software. Persistent configuration is also known as using a <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address.</b> In contrast, when a computer's IP address is assigned newly each time it restarts, this is known as using a dynamic IP address.|$|E
50|$|BE {{also changed}} its methods of {{assigning}} <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addresses,</b> selling netblocks of one, six and fourteen {{as opposed to}} the old system of a group of addresses from a pool of arbitrarily available IPs.

50|$|Dynamic NAT, {{just like}} static NAT, is not common in smaller {{networks}} but is found within larger corporations with complex networks. The way dynamic NAT differs from static NAT {{is that where}} static NAT provides a one-to-one internal to public <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> mapping, dynamic NAT doesn't make the mapping to the public IP address static and usually uses a group of available public IP addresses.|$|E
50|$|There {{is always}} a desire for more time servers, as the more time servers are in the pool, the lower the {{resource}} demand on each member. Joining the pool requires at least a broadband connection to the Internet, a <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address,</b> and accurate time from another source (for example from another NTP server, from a DCF77 receiver, WWVB receiver or a GPS receiver).|$|E
50|$|When an {{instance}} is created, an ephemeral external IP address is automatically {{assigned to the}} instance by default. This address {{is attached to the}} instance {{for the life of the}} instance and is released once the instance has been terminated. GCE also provides mechanism to reserve and attach static IPs to the VMs. An ephemeral IP address can be promoted to a <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address.</b>|$|E

25|$|Also in 2006, Amazon {{introduced}} Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), {{a virtual}} site farm, allowing users {{to use the}} Amazon infrastructure to run applications ranging from running simulations to web hosting. In 2008, Amazon improved the service by adding Elastic Block Store (EBS), offering persistent storage for Amazon EC2 instances and Elastic <b>IP</b> <b>addresses,</b> and offering <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> designed for dynamic cloud computing.|$|R
50|$|Defenses against ARP {{spoofing}} generally rely on {{some form}} of certification or cross-checking of ARP responses. Uncertified ARP responses are blocked. These techniques may be integrated with the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server so that both dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> are certified. This capability may also be implemented in individual hosts or may be integrated into Ethernet switches or other network equipment.|$|R
50|$|When the {{endpoint}} isn't a <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address,</b> the user, or a program, has {{to instruct}} the tunnel broker {{to update the}} endpoint address. This can be done using the tunnel broker's web site or using an automated protocol like TSP or Heartbeat, as used by AICCU. In {{the case of a}} tunnel broker using TSP, the client automatically restarting the tunnel will cause the endpoint address and port to be updated.|$|E
5000|$|Its first {{service was}} the [...] "standard dial-up" [...] (SDU) - full TCP/IP access on a <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> with a user chosen 4 to 8 {{character}} [...] "nodename" [...] (later 3-16 character [...] "hostname") in the [...]demon.co.uk domain e.g. example.demon.co.uk. This allowed users to receive SMTP mail and other IP traffic direct to their computers. It {{was possible to}} operate independently of Demon or {{to make use of}} Demon's mail, news and IRC servers.|$|E
50|$|Amazon's elastic IP address {{feature is}} similar to <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> in {{traditional}} data centers, with one key difference. A user can programmatically map an elastic IP address to any virtual machine instance without a network administrator's help and without having to wait for DNS to propagate the binding. In this sense an Elastic IP Address belongs to the account and not to a virtual machine instance. It exists until it is explicitly removed, and remains associated with the account even while it is associated with no instance.|$|E
5000|$|Home server: {{usually a}} single machine {{placed in a}} private {{residence}} {{can be used to}} host one or more web sites from a usually consumer-grade broadband connection. These can be purpose-built machines or more commonly old PCs. Some ISPs actively attempt to block home servers by disallowing incoming requests to TCP port 80 of the user's connection and by refusing to provide <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addresses.</b> A common way to attain a reliable DNS host name is by creating an account with a dynamic DNS service. A dynamic DNS service will automatically change the <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> that a URL points to when the <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> changes.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} electronic {{integrity in}} the context of curbing double submissions during e-assessments. Submission of examination answers {{is an important part of}} assessment whether paper or electronic based. As will be discussed in this paper, double submission of an assessment test by one student is a breach in electronic integrity and it breeds electronic corruption. The proposed solutions will present a method to reduce this problem, by combining students’ login ID with <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> for the duration of an e-assessment. This technique will ensure single submission of tests per student in e-learning systems...|$|R
50|$|Software that detects ARP {{spoofing}} generally {{relies on}} {{some form of}} certification or cross-checking of ARP responses. Uncertified ARP responses are then blocked. These techniques may be integrated with the DHCP server so that both dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> are certified. This capability may be implemented in individual hosts or may be integrated into Ethernet switches or other network equipment. The existence of multiple <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> associated with a single MAC address may indicate an ARP spoof attack, although there are legitimate uses of such a configuration. In a more passive approach a device listens for ARP replies on a network, and sends a notification via email when an ARP entry changes.|$|R
50|$|A typical {{configuration}} on a {{home network}} would be DHCP with automatic assignment of the network parameters. Manual DHCP configuration requires the primary and secondary DNS server address to be entered. A PPPoE connection requires {{in addition to this}} the internet service user ID and password, and whether or not to save the password. A <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> connection requires the IP address, subnet mask, default router, primary and secondary DNS server address to be entered. The network connection can be tested from a menu option before going online; error code 21003 indicates a successful connection.|$|E
50|$|ElasticHosts has {{two types}} of IPv4 {{addresses}} - static and dynamic. Both are allocated from the same pools of addresses, but static addresses are kept by the account, and can be allocated to any account's server at any time. Dynamic ones are randomly allocated for any server {{that has not been}} specifically allocated a <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address.</b> These are not guaranteed to remain the same, though remain for the lifespan of the instance. A shutdown of the virtual machine may or may not reallocate the IP address. ElasticHosts does not lock a static IP to a server instance - they can be reallocated from the control panel. Reverse DNS is managed by the customer from the control panel.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 Telecom New Zealand began {{providing}} {{broadband internet}} (ADSL) {{under the name}} JetStream. There was a progressive roll out into local exchanges. JetStream services were offered by many different ISPs, with Telecom billing for all data usage and the ISP charging for authentication and other services such as a <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address.</b> Home users were offered 'starter' plans at 128 kbit/s upload and download. Speeds greater than 128 kbit/s were extremely expensive and extra data (beyond the allowance) was charged at over $0.10 per MB. Telecom progressively introduced lower cost home options. Businesses were able to access 'full speed' services at up to 8 Mbit/s downstream and 800 kbit/s upstream, with data charges up to $0.20 per MB.|$|E
5000|$|All AT&T U-verse {{transport}} types use 802.1x authentication. This means only {{equipment on}} AT&T's approved list {{works with the}} U-verse service, as other (non-AT&T) equipment cannot authenticate with AT&T DSLAMs and GPONs. Another side-effect of U-verse's authentication protocol {{is the lack of}} bridge mode support (unlike standard DSL that uses PPPoE authentication, which is easily bridgeable). At best, the 2Wire/Pace routers support DMZ+ mode, while the Motorola devices support IP Passthrough. AT&T allows residential and business customers to pay for <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addresses,</b> which they support on all AT&T approved equipment (including the 2Wire/Pace and Motorola routers.) ...|$|R
50|$|After {{the sale}} of BE to BSkyB in March 2013, BSkyB {{announced}} that the BE and O2 networks were to close and that customers would be migrated over to the existing Sky Broadband service. This resulted in the closure of BE's email and website hosting services, the discontinuation of line bonding, multiple <b>static</b> <b>IPs</b> and Annex M {{as well as the}} closure of the BE/O2 Wholesale network. Users were also gifted their existing loaned Be-Boxes. Many users however had concerns with becoming Sky customers and decided to leave rather than migrate. To try and accommodate some of their concerns Sky worked to integrate both <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> and control over line profiles into their own network and launched this new service as 'Sky Broadband Unlimited Pro'.|$|R
30|$|Four {{types of}} charge are {{relevant}} to database migration and therefore captured by our cloud cost metamodel: service, compute, storage, and transfer. A ‘ServiceCharge’ represents non-infrastructure charges, e.g, an AWS Support Plan, <b>static</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addresses,</b> or VPN connections. This consists of a fee and a duration which can be specified in minutes, hours, days, months, or years. A ‘ComputeCharge’ models {{the cost of a}} cloud Virtual Machine running for a given time (e.g., Amazon EC 2), while a ‘StorageCharge’ corresponds to the cost of persistent data storage (e.g., Amazon S 3). A ‘TransferCharge’ represents the cost for data sent or received across a network. Charges may be tiered so that a per-unit discount is applied for heavy usage or to allow regional price differences.|$|R
