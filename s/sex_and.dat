5|$|A feature-length {{historical}} film Caligula {{was completed}} in 1979, in which Malcolm McDowell played the lead role. The film alienated audiences with explicit <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> violence.

5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> gender in their research.|$|E

5|$|Rodents use scent marking in {{many social}} {{contexts}} including inter- and intra-species communication, the marking of trails {{and the establishment}} of territories. Their urine provides genetic information about individuals including the species, the <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> individual identity, and metabolic information on dominance, reproductive status and health. Compounds derived from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are bound to several urinary proteins. The odor of a predator depresses scent-marking behavior.|$|E

5|$|The main {{character}} is Pearl Penalosa, a Latina superhero in Spring City.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of common misconceptions {{regarding}} <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> pregnancy. Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control. Additionally, it is associated with a number of health problems and thus is not recommended. Women can become pregnant the first time they have sexual intercourse and in any sexual position. It is possible, although not very likely, to become pregnant during menstruation.|$|E

Shortly afterward, the label introduced him to musician Steve Vai. Impressed with Townsend's vocal work, Vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album <b>Sex</b> <b>and</b> Religion. After recording <b>Sex</b> <b>and</b> Religion, Townsend accompanied Vai on a world tour in support of the album. Townsend soon landed a second touring gig, this time with the opening band of Vai's tour, the Wildhearts. He played live with the band throughout half of 1994 in Europe, and appeared as a guest musician on their single Urge. Ginger, the band's frontman, remained close friends with Townsend, later co-writing several songs on Infinity and the Christeen + 4 Demos EP.|$|E

5|$|Abstinence-only sex {{education}} does not reduce teenage pregnancy. Teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education, {{as compared with}} comprehensive {{sex education}}. Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> other forms of penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited {{near the entrance to}} the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{criticism}} of Inseminoid has {{concentrated on the}} film's treatment of the female <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> female sexualities {{in the context of}} corruption by an alien source. In addition to its depiction of the abject Sandy, who is rendered a distorted Other in the aftermath of her unnatural impregnation, the film has been seen to incorporate a clash between the patriarchal and the maternal towards its climax, as the new mother kills her former friends one by one. Complementing the film's successful VHS run, a novelisation of Inseminoid was written by Larry Miller.|$|E
