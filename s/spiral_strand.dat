50|$|While many cables {{have a solid}} {{dielectric}}, {{many others}} have a foam dielectric that contains as much air or other gas as possible to reduce the losses by allowing {{the use of a}} larger diameter center conductor. Foam coax will have about 15% less attenuation but some types of foam dielectric can absorb moisture - especially at its many surfaces — in humid environments, significantly increasing the loss. Supports shaped like stars or spokes are even better but more expensive and very susceptible to moisture infiltration. Still more expensive were the air-spaced coaxials used for some inter-city communications in the mid-20th century. The center conductor was suspended by polyethylene discs every few centimeters. In some low-loss coaxial cables such as the RG-62 type, the inner conductor is supported by a <b>spiral</b> <b>strand</b> of polyethylene, so that an air space exists between most of the conductor and the inside of the jacket. The lower dielectric constant of air allows for a greater inner diameter at the same impedance and a greater outer diameter at the same cutoff frequency, lowering ohmic losses. Inner conductors are sometimes silver-plated to smooth the surface and reduce losses due to skin effect. A rough surface prolongs the path for the current and concentrates the current at peaks and, thus, increases ohmic losses.|$|E

The effects of an external hydrostatic pressure on certain structural characteristics of sealed spiral strands, used in deep water applications, have also been studied in some detail, for water depths ranging from 0 m to 2000 m. The results, based on such theoretical parametric studies, have, for example, been used to refute claims by Jolicoeur that, by a simple modification, a significant improvement to the original orthotropic sheet model of Hobbs and Raoof, had been found. In addition, using such studies, axial fatigue life design S-N curves have been developed, which cater for the effects of an externally applied hydrostatic pressure on sheathed spiral strands. Simple (hand-based) formulations have also been developed for estimating the maximum frictional axial and torsional hysteresis along with,the associated axial load range/mean axial load, and range of twist/ 2, respectively, at which they occur, relating to both, the in-air conditions and also when a sheathed <b>spiral</b> <b>strand</b> is subjected to an external hydrostatic pressure.

This paper presents the first ever numerical and experimental study on commonly used high-strength steel <b>spiral</b> <b>strand</b> cables subjected to high velocity fragment impact. <b>Spiral</b> <b>strand</b> cables were impacted by 20 mm fragment simulating projectiles travelling at velocities between 200 and 1400 m/s.

Considering the damage caused, the residual cable breaking strengths were estimated and found to be still higher than the minimum breaking load of an un-damaged cable.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The primary aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the bending behaviour of helically wound steel cables of various types (i. e. normal <b>spiral</b> <b>strands,</b> sheathed <b>spiral</b> <b>strands</b> and locked coil cables) in the presence of friction and to propose more efficient computational models for their analysis under combined tension and bending. The proposed model fully takes into account interwire contact forces both in the radial direction (point contact between wires in different layers) and hoop direction (line contact within the wires in the same layer). Extensive theoretical parametric studies have been undertaken on a variety of cable constructions covering a wide range of geometrical and material parameters. Explicit formulations have been developed for the smooth transition of the bending stiffness from no-slip to full slip regimes, as a function of cable curvature. Based on these formulations, it is now possible to calculate the relative displacements of the wires, as well as the tensile, bending and hoop stresses in the individual wires of the cable. Furthermore, bending stiffness of the cable is shown to decrease by a factor of 2 to 16, depending upon the friction coefficient between wires and the type of cable construction. Wherever possible, the theoretical results have been compared with experimental results from the available literature and are found in very good agreement with them. A simple method for the determination of the bending stiffness of large diameter multi-layered cable has been developed. The simplified method is further shown to provide estimates of the bending stiffness which are very close to those calculated by the original theory, allowing hand calculations for an easier use in industry. The proposed formulations have been extended to cater for the effects of external hydrostatic pressure on sheathed <b>spiral</b> <b>strands</b> in deep water applications. These forces are shown to have a great influence on the pattern of interwire contact forces and hence the interlayer slippage between the wires in the strand. Numerical results have been obtained and analysed for three different 127 mm diameter strands with lay angles of 12 °, 18 ° and 24 ° respectively, experiencing a wide range of external hydrostatic pressures of 0 to 2, 000 metres. The significant increase in normal contact Page | iv force between wires is shown to suppress the slippage of wires in the cable. However, the no-slip and full slip values of the effective bending stiffness of the cable is shown to be independent of the level of hydrostatic pressure. A theoretical model is also proposed for estimating wire kinematics, pattern of interwire slippage, contact forces as well as the flexural rigidity of locked coil cables with outer layers made of shaped wires. In order to validate this model, numerical results are reported for two different locked coil cables. It is shown that the shaped wires in the outer layers of locked coil cables {{play an important role in}} the distribution of contact forces, slip initiation and cable unwinding...|$|R
40|$|In civil engineering, {{steel cables}} {{are widely used}} in the {{construction}} of bridges and sports stadia. However, their robustness and resilience against explosively formed fragment impact, whether accidental or malicious, remains largely unknown and very little research has been carried out on this subject to date. The concern is that small fragments projected from the explosion and travelling at high velocity may induce significant damage to the cables. This damage could rupture a cable releasing large amounts of kinetic energy into the surrounding structure and other damaged cables resulting in multiple cable loss and possible disproportionate collapse of the structure. To begin investigating this problem a good understanding of the localised damage sustained by the cables on impact is required. The work described within this thesis begins to address this problem by use of both physical tests and detailed finite element analysis. The tests involved firing fragment simulating projectiles at velocities ranging from 200 – 1400 m/s at un-tensioned <b>spiral</b> <b>strand</b> cables.

It is also shown that, in practice, the effective fixed end to the spiral strands undergoing such cyclic bending is located not at the face of the zinc-socketed termination, but well within the socket itself; for an axially preloaded <b>spiral</b> <b>strand</b> of 39 mm outside diameter, the effective point of end fixity is shown to be located inside the conical housing, about 60 mm (or, say, 1. 5 diameters) away {{from the face of the}} socket.

The final closed-form formulations can handle both the no-slip and/or the traditionally used full-slip coupled extensional/torsional constitutive equations for helically wound cables, and describe the various characteristics of the resulting pairs of axial or torsional waves at any location along the cable with one end fixed against movement and the other end subjected to impact loading. By using extensive numerical results, which cover {{the full range of}} current manufacturing limits for the lay angle (with this being the sole controlling geometrical parameter as far as the axial/torsional stiffnesses are concerned), it is shown that significant differences exist between a number of axial/torsional wave characteristics, depending on whether the no-slip or the full-slip version of the constitutive relations is used in the analysis. It is demonstrated that modest increases in the magnitudes of the lay angles can lead to significant increases in the differences between the no-slip and the full-slip wave propagation characteristics. The present findings may have significant practical implications in relation to the currently adopted techniques used by industry for calibrating the electronic boxes, which are subsequently used as permanently installed devices, for the in situ detection of individual wire fractures under, say, fatigue loading associated with cable-supported structures...|$|R

Bending behavior {{can play an important}} role in modeling slack cables and in "critical" regions of flexible ropes, such as in the neighborhood of clamping devices. When a strand is bent, wires tend to slip relatively one to each other. In the present work, the critical conditions for the onset of inter-layer sliding are investigated by defining the limit domain for wire slipping (the domain of "admissible values" for the axial force of a generic wire, accounting also for the contribution due to bending of the strand). The special case of uniform bending of the strand is considered and a closed form expression of the limit domain is presented. The non-holonomic nature of the strand mechanical model developed in this work leads to a lacking of symmetry for the tangent stiffness matrix. In the paper it is proved that this condition can be de facto relaxed in practical applications and that an elastic potential function, relating the generalized stress and strain variables of the strand in bending, can be defined only under the limit kinematic hypotheses of "full stick-state" or of "full slip-state". The aforementioned results are used as the starting block from which the strand full mechanical behavior for coupled axial force and bending is derived.

Damage {{is described as a}} reduction of the cable cross section, and defined in terms of its intensity, extent and position. The major effects of these different damage parameters on the cable static response and spectral properties are evidenced and discussed to verify the observability of the damage.

The damage identification problem is formulated by defining an objective error function between the measured and the model frequencies, to be minimized in the space of the damage parameters. Pseudo-experimental data are initially used to test the effectiveness and resolution of the procedure. The results confirm the uniqueness of the problem solution and its correctness.

Beyond a certain limit of this ratio, plane sections do not remain plane and, depending {{on the level of}} axial tension and imposed radius of curvature, interlayer slippage takes place, starting from the outer layer and spreading towards the centre of the strand. On the theoretical side, apart from one publication in the mid- 1980 s and some fairly recent publications by the first author and his associates, all other theoreticians have previously assumed either plane-section bending or, in many cases, have totally ignored the ever-present interwire friction, assuming that the individual helical wires act as simple helical springs.

Cable bolts used in mines are basically steel strands with different constructions {{depending on the}} number of wires or elements and the way that these elements are laid. Tendon bolts (rebar and cable) are normally evaluated for strength and {{load transfer}} properties. The strength of tendon can be carried out by tensile failure tests, while the load transfer strength is evaluated by pull and shear strength tests. Short Encapsulation Pull Testing (SEPT) is used to study of the load transfer capacities of tendons, and can be undertaken both in the laboratory and in situ. A new apparatus known as Minova Axially Split Embedment Apparatus (MASEA) was used to study load-displacement characteristics of smooth versus spiral profile cable bolts. Minova Stratabinder grout was used for encapsulating 400 mm long 19 wire 22 mm diameter superstrand cable in the embedment units. The anchorage of the cable on two sides of the embedment apparatus were intentionally installed at different lengths, to allow the cable to be pulled out {{from one side of the}} anchorage. The <b>spiral</b> wire <b>strand</b> cable bolts achieved higher peak pull-out load at minimum displacement in comparison with smooth surface wire strand. The peak pull out force increased with the age of encapsulation grout. The MASEA was easier to assemble and test at a short period of time, thus allowing quick and repeated tests to be undertaken...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spiral</b> {{wire rope}} <b>strands</b> and {{overhead}} electrical conductors {{are examples of}} helical wire assemblies. The use of these helically wound wires constitute a wide class of important engineering components. When they are subjected to axial loads (tensile and torsional), these structures may still exhibit the helically symmetric characteristic after loading. For this reason, this feature {{can be used to}} simplify the analysis of these structures and to reduce model size in numerical simulations. In this paper, the formulation of helically symmetric boundary conditions is used and a general strand model using the finite element method (FEM) is presented. The model is capable of taking into account the effects of tension, shear, torsion, contact, friction and possible local plastic yielding and has been successfully used to predict the global behavior of simple straight wire rope strand as well as the stress distribution, which are very difficult to predict analytically. As most of the strand models, the length of the strand is assumed sufficiently long for the clamping conditions to be negligible. The finite analysis results showed excellent agreement with the analytical theory of Costello and the experimental results obtained by Utting and Jones [6, 7]...|$|R
40|$|Orthorhombic {{crystals}} of {{the complex}} formed between bovine alpha-chymotrypsin and a recombinant human mucous proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) were grown. Data to 2. 3 A resolution were collected on the area-detector diffractometer FAST. The crystal structure {{of the complex}} was solved by Patterson search techniques using chymotrypsin as a search model. A cyclic procedure of modeling and crystallographic refinement enabled {{the determination of the}} SLPI structure. The current crystallographic R-value is 0. 19. SLPI has a boomerang-like shape with both wings comprising two well separated domains of similar architecture. In each domain the polypeptide chain is arranged like a stretched <b>spiral.</b> Two internal <b>strands</b> form a regular beta-hairpin loop which is accompanied by two external strands linked by the proteinase binding segment. The polypeptide segment of each domain is interconnected by four disulfide bridges with a connectivity pattern hitherto unobserved. The reactive site loop of the second domain has elastase and chymotrypsin binding properties. It contains the scissile peptide bond between Leu 72 I and Met 73 I and has a similar conformation to that observed in other serine proteinase protein inhibitors. Eight residues of this loop, two of the adjacent hairpin loop, the C-terminal segment and Trp 30 I are in direct contact with the cognate enzyme. The binding loop of the first domain (probably with anti-trypsin activity) is disordered due to proteolytic cleavage occurring in the course of crystallization...|$|R
