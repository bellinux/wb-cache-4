X ray absorption spectroscopy including XANES and EXAFS were used to investigate electronic and local structural changes of NiFe 2 O 4 during the 1 st lithiation and de lithiation process. As lithium is inserted into the <b>structure,</b> <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>site</b> Fe 3 ions are reduced to Fe 2 and moved from <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>sites</b> to empty octahedral sites, while Ni 2 ions are unaffected.
