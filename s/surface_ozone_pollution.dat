This source identification is performed two ways: 1) through an analysis of sonde data, including ozone concentrations, wind speed and direction, and relative humidity data, and 2) through an analysis that combines trajectory calculations with surface monitor data. We also examine regional changes in Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) measurements of formaldehyde and ozone from 2004 – 2010.

Ozone concentrations correlate well with weather parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity, and wind parameters in the boundary layer.

Key words: surface ozone, <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution,</b> surface ozone forecasting. The current importance of monitoring surface ozone concentrations (SOC) in big cities is related with the necessity of monitoring air quality. Its low quality in warm seasons is mostly connected with exceeding maximum permissible concentrations (MPC) of ozone. Regular SOC observations in the green zone of Moscow were initiated in 1991 and are reported in (Zvyagintsev and Kuznetsova, 2002).

While <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> is mostly produced by photochemistry in summer, elevated ozone concentrations can also be influenced by long range transport driven by the atmospheric circulation and stratospheric ozone intrusions. We analyze the role of large scale atmospheric circulation variability in the North Atlantic basin in determining <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations over Europe. Here, we show, using ground station measurements and a coupled atmosphere-chemistry model simulation for the period 1980 – 2005, that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) does affect <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations – on a monthly timescale, over 10 ppbv in southwestern, central and northern Europe – during all seasons except fall. The commonly used NAO index is able to capture the link existing between atmospheric dynamics and <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations in winter and spring but it fails in summer. We find that the first Principal Component, computed from the time variation of the sea level pressure (SLP) field, detects the atmosphere circulation/ozone relationship not only in winter and spring but also during summer, when the atmospheric circulation weakens and regional photochemical processes peak. Given the NAO forecasting skill at intraseasonal time scale, the first Principal Component of the SLP field {{could be used as}} an indicator to identify areas more exposed to forthcoming <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> events.

The directives on <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> in ambient air provided by United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and World Health Organization (WHO) for vegetation protection (AOT 40) have been used to assess the air quality. A substantial temporal and spatial variation in AOT 40 values has been observed across the Indian region. Large areas of India show ozone values above the AOT 40 threshold limit (3000 ppb h for 3 months). Simulated AOT 40 values are found to be substantially higher throughout the year over the most fertile Indo-Gangetic plains than the other regions of India, which can have an adverse effect on plants and vegetation in this region. The observed monthly AOT 40 values reported from an Indian station, agree reasonably well with model simulated results. There is an underestimation of AOT 40 in the model results during the periods of highest ozone concentration from December to March.

40|$|AbstractWRF/Chem, a fully coupled meteorology–chemistry model, {{was used}} for the {{simulation}} of <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> over the Central Gulf Coast region in Southeast United States of America (USA). Two ozone episodes during June 8 – 11, 2006 and July 18 – 22, 2006 characterized with hourly mixing ratios of 60 – 100 ppbv, were selected for the study. Suite of sensitivity experiments were conducted with three different planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes and three land surface models (LSM). The results indicate that Yonsei–University (YSU) PBL scheme in combination with NOAH and SOIL LSMs produce better simulations of both the meteorological and chemical species than others. YSU PBL scheme in combination with NOAH LSM had slightly better simulation than with SOIL scheme. Spatial comparison with observations showed that YSUNOAH experiment well simulated the diurnal mean ozone mixing ratio, timing of diurnal cycle as well as range in ozone mixing ratio at most monitoring stations with an overall correlation of 0. 726, bias of – 1. 55 ppbv, mean absolute error of 8. 11 ppbv and root mean square error of 14. 5 ppbv; and with an underestimation of 7 ppbv in the daytime peak ozone and about 8 % in the daily average ozone. Model produced 1 –hr, and 8 –hr average ozone values were well correlated with corresponding observed means. The minor underestimation of daytime ozone is attributed to the slight underestimation of air temperature which tend to slow–down the ozone production and overestimation of wind speeds which transport the produced ozone at a faster rate. Simulated mean horizontal and vertical flow patterns suggest the role of the horizontal transport and the PBL diffusion in the development of high ozone during the episode. Overall, the model is found to perform reasonably well to simulate the ozone and other precursor pollutants with good correlations and low error metrics. Thus the study demonstrates the potential of WRF/Chem model for air quality prediction in coastal environments...|$|E
40|$|We {{characterize}} a transboundary <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> outbreak transported across East Asia {{in early}} May 2009 using new multispectral satellite observations of lowermost tropospheric ozone in synergy with other satellite data and models. Our analysis {{is focused on}} the daily evolution of <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> plumes initially formed over the North China Plain (NCP) and their transport pathways over Northern China, Korea, Japan and the surrounding seas. A main aspect of the study is an estimation of the contribution of photochemical production of ozone along transport using the ratio of ozone to carbon monoxide enhancements with respect to background levels derived from satellite data and also from chemistry-transport models. A key contribution of the analysis is the use of new satellite data offering unprecedented skills to observe the horizontal distribution of lowermost tropospheric ozone over East Asia on daily basis, with a multispectral approach called IASI+GOME 2. These satellite observations are in good agreement with ozonesondes, with low mean biases (3  %), a precision of about 16  %, a correlation coefficient of 0. 85 and practically the same standard deviation for a comparison based on 2 years of data from 46 launching stations distributed worldwide, during all seasons. A similar agreement is also found over East Asia. Moreover, IASI+GOME 2 offers a unique capacity for observing the evolution of near <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> during <b>pollution</b> outbreaks (with 5  % bias and 0. 69 correlation), according to a comparison with surface in situ measurements during 2 major ozone events over several Japanese Islands. Single-band ozone retrievals, as those from IASI in the thermal infrared, do not capture such variability. Using IASI+GOME 2, we put in evidence that (i) <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> plumes are transported by an anticyclonic circulation around the Yellow Sea from the NCP to Northern China, Korea and Japan, co-located with carbon monoxide plumes, (ii) over Northern China the plume splits into two pollution filaments with one mixing with freshly emitted pollutants and (iii) ozone is produced every day of the event accounting for an enhancement in concentration during transport across East Asia of up to ∼  84  % with respect to that produced over NCP. This estimation is done according to monotonically increasing values during 7 days of the ratio of ozone to carbon monoxide enhancements within the transported pollution plumes from about ∼  0. 25 over the NCP to ∼  0. 46 over the Pacific south of Japan...|$|R

40|$|As an {{important}} solar-radiation absorbing aerosol, {{the effect of}} black carbon (BC) on <b>surface</b> <b>ozone,</b> by influencing photolysis rate, has been widely discussed by offline model studies. However, BC-boundary layer (BL) interactions also influence <b>surface</b> <b>ozone.</b> Using the online model simulations and processes analysis, we demonstrate the significant impact of BC-BL interaction on <b>surface</b> <b>ozone.</b> The absorbing effect of BC heats the air above the BL and suppresses BL development, which eventually leads {{to changes in the}} contributions of ozone through chemical and physical processes (photochemistry, vertical mixing, and advection). Different from previous offline model studies, BL suppression leads large amounts of ozone precursors being confined below the BL which offsetting the influence from the reduction of photolysis rate, thus enhancing ozone photochemical formation before noon. Furthermore, the changes in physical process show a more significant influence on <b>surface</b> <b>ozone.</b> The weakened turbulence entrains much less ozone from the overlying ozone-rich air down to surface. As a result, the net contribution of ozone from physical and chemical processes leads to <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> reduction before noon. The maximum reduction reaches to 16. 4  ppb at 12 : 00. In the afternoon, the changes in chemical process are small which influence inconspicuously to <b>surface</b> <b>ozone.</b> However, physical process still influences the <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> significantly.

40|$|Human {{activities}} have substantially increased atmospheric deposition of reactive nitrogen to the Earth's surface, inducing unintentional effects on ecosystems with complex environmental and climate consequences.

Here we combine a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and a global land model (Community Land Model, CLM) {{to address this issue}} with a focus on <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> in the Northern Hemisphere. We consider three processes that are important for <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> and can be perturbed by the addition of atmospheric deposited nitrogen – namely, emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ozone dry deposition, and soil nitrogen oxide (NO x) emissions. We find that present-day anthropogenic nitrogen deposition (65  Tg N a − 1 to the land), through enhancing plant growth (represented as increases in vegetation leaf area index, LAI, in the model), could increase <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> from increased biogenic VOC emissions (e. g., a 6. 6  Tg increase in isoprene emission), but it could also decrease ozone due to higher ozone dry deposition velocities (up to 0. 02 – 0. 04  cm s − 1 increases). Meanwhile, deposited anthropogenic nitrogen to soil enhances soil NO x emissions. The overall effect on summer mean <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations shows general increases over the globe (up to 1. 5 – 2. 3  ppbv over the western US and South Asia), except for some regions with high anthropogenic NO x emissions (0. 5 – 1. 0  ppbv decreases over the eastern US, western Europe, and North China).

40|$|Background: PAPRICA is a {{research}} program designed to estimate {{the impact on the}} health of patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency of a prevention strategy based on notification of <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution.</b> The first year of this study was conducted during the 2003 heat wave, and high temperatures were therefore considered as a confounding factor in the data analysis. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the relationship between ozone and temperature in order to propose a methodology to distinguish between the effects of ozone and temperature on the impact of a prevention strategy with regard to <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution.</b> Methods: Multivariate analyses were used to identify associated climate and <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> profiles. This descriptive method is of great value to highlight the complexity of interactions between these parameters. Results: Ozone concentration and temperature were strongly correlated, but the health impact of <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> alone will be evaluated by focusing on situations characterized by ozone concentrations above 110 µg/m 3 / 8 h (air quality guidelines to protect human health defined by the French legislation) and temperatures lower than 26 °C, below the discomfort threshold...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{economic}} growth {{has given rise}} to a significant increase in ozone precursor emissions in many regions of China, especially in the densely populated North China Plain (NCP) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Improved understanding of ozone formation in response to different precursor emissions is imperative to address the highly nonlinear ozone problem and to provide a solid scientific basis for efficient ozone abatement in these regions. A comparative study on ozone photochemical production in summer has thus been carried out in the megacities of Tianjin (NCP) and Shanghai (YRD). Two intensive field campaigns were carried out respectively at an urban and a suburban site of Tianjin, in addition to routine monitoring of trace gases in Shanghai, providing data sets of <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> and its precursors including nitrogen oxides (NO x) and various non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs). <b>Ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> in summer was found to be more severe in the Tianjin region than in the Shanghai region, based on either the frequency or the duration of high ozone events. Such differences might be attributed to the large amount of highly reactive NMHCs in Tianjin. Industry related species like light alkenes were of particular importance in both urban and suburban Tianjin, while in Shanghai aromatics dominated. In general, the ozone problem in Shanghai is on an urban scale. Stringent control policies on local emissions would help reduce the occurrence of high ozone concentrations. By contrast, <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> in Tianjin is probably a regional problem. Combined efforts to reduce ozone precursor emissions on a regional scale must be undertaken to bring the ozone problem under control...|$|R

40|$|This study assesses {{a number}} of policy options that could help reduce ground level <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> in Beijing. Ground level <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> {{is one of the}} most {{significant}} air pollution problems in big cities in China. Because of the complex way in which ozone is formed, it is difficult for policy makers to identify optimal control options on a cost-effective basis. The study assesses a range of options to address this problem. It compares the effectiveness and economic costs of these options, and then recommends the most effective sequence in which the options should be adopted to realize pollution control at the lowest cost. The study finds that the installation of oil gas recovery systems at Beijing's 1446 gasoline stations would be the most cost-effective option. Overall, it is found that options to reduce <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> by cutting vehicular emissions are much more cost-effective than options to "clean-ip" coal-fired plants. A series of options for controlling vehicular emissions have been introduced, including substituting gasoline buses with clean fuel buses and phasing out high emission vehicles (those with low emission standards) in Beijing. The study also highlights that cost-effective pollution control can be achieved by, for example, better practices when refueling vehicles. The results of this research are expected to help decision makers to bate <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> in a cost-effective way. pollution, China...|$|R
