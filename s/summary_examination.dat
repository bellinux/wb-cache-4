There were 48 participants invited. In this study, teacher's gender, age, job status, educational level, school level, and school district were analyzed to explore the differences in learning behaviors and performance. The results showed that the higher average face identification rate, the more learning satisfaction, subjects had more login times, login times in the morning, time total quantity of login, study time total quantity, participation modular unit numbers, the higher <b>summary</b> <b>examination</b> average scores.

40|$|<b>Summary.</b> <b>Examination</b> of {{hormonal}} changes {{occurring in}} farm species {{at the onset}} of puberty, during the follicular phase of the oestrous cycle, and at those times when ovarian activity is re-established after periods of seasonal or lactational anoestrus, provides circumstantial evidence that the final phases of follicular development are dependent on a pattern of tonic (episodic) LH secretion. A suppression of episodic LH secretion is associated with periods of anovulation. Stimulation of tonic LH secretion by repeated injections of small doses of synthetic Gn-RH or purified LH restores normal reproductive function in all but deeply anoestrous animals. Continuous infusion of Gn-RH is as effective as repeated injections. It is suggested that an additional inadequacy, possibly endocrine, contributes to the anovulatory state in deep anoestrus...|$|E
40|$|<b>SUMMARY</b> <b>Examination</b> of two lesions in the {{anterior}} {{margin of the}} liver suggested that {{the origin of the}} so called "solitary necrotic " nodule lies in non-malignant tissue. An origin in sclerosing haemagioma seems probable. In 1983 Shepherd and Lee described five cases of an unusual lesion in the liver; four were described in detail and the other added as a note. ' The lesions were described as having a "completely necrotic core " and a hyalinised fibrotic capsule containing elastic fibres. The central areas of the cores con-tained reticulin in two cases, and an illustration of this suggested to me that the lesions might have originated in sclerosing haemangiomas.

40|$|<b>Summary.</b> <b>Examination</b> by light-, {{transmission}} electron- and scanning electron-microscopy {{showed that}} flushing the lumen {{of the mouse}} uterus with small volumes of fluid damaged the endometrium by rupturing and removing luminal epithelial cells, splitting the epithelial basement membrane and connective tissue stroma, and rupturing and leaching stromal cells and blood vessels. The damage increased with increasing progestation of the uterus and between Days 4 and 5 of pregnancy. I conclude that many so-called 'luminal fluid ' proteins originate from luminal and stromal cells, intercellular fluid and blood and that apparent changes in luminal fluid protein content during early pregnancy may largely reflect alterations in the extent and type of damage produced by flushing, {{as a consequence of}} changes in the physical state of the uterus induced by hormones and the presence of blastocysts...|$|E
40|$|<b>SUMMARY</b> <b>Examination</b> of the retinal tissues {{obtained}} at necropsy from a 14 -year-old boy with Kearns-Sayre syndrome showed marked photoreceptor and pigment epithelial cell {{loss in the}} retinal periphery and around the optic nerve head. Electron microscopy of surviving retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells indicated a loss of apical microvilli and basal infoldings. The RPE was unusually devoid of melanosomes and showed no evidence of phagocytosis of photoreceptor debris. The cytoplasm of the RPE contained numerous, often enlarged, mitochondria. These structural changes suggested that a breakdown in the energy dependent interrelationships between the RPE and the photoreceptor layer {{was responsible for the}} outer retinal degeneration. The finding of numerous macrophages in the subretinal space suggests a secondary inflammatory component in the retinal degeneration. This paper presents the histopathological and ultra-structural findings in the well preserved retinal tissues of a 14 -year-old boy suffering from Kearns disease of infantile onset or Kearns-Sayre syndrome.

40|$|<b>SUMMARY.</b> <b>Examination</b> of some {{pyroxenite}} nodules {{from the}} Jagersfontein kimberlite {{shows that they}} have suffered variable deformation followed by different degrees of recovery. Most interes~ting of the nodules is the 'diallage rock', which consists of highly sheared and broken lamellar crystals of diopside containing exsolved enstatite. Petrographic evidence indicates a pre-tectonic exsolution of enstatite and a syntectonic exsolution of pyrope-almandine from enstatite. Deformation occurred in the mantle, prior to incorporation of the nodule in the kimberlite. Compositions of pyroxenes from the diallage rock suggest i re-equilibrated at a temperature of iooo ~ and at a pressure of about 35 kb. Olivine and phlogopite, accompanied by serpentine, occur only in broken kink-bands in the diallage rock and they {{are considered to be}} of secondary origin, precipitated from kimberlite magma t temperatures near 70 o ~ IN 'Genesis of the Diamond ' (O 3 z), Williams described in some detail many of the discrete chrome-diopside nodules found in kimberlite.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{instantaneous}} {{normal mode}} method, normal mode analysis is performed at instantaneous configurations of a condensed-phase system, leading to modes with negative eigenvalues. These negative modes {{provide a means}} of characterizing local anharmonicities of the potential energy surface. Here, we apply instantaneous normal mode to analyze temperature-dependent diffusive dynamics in molecular dynamics simulations of a small protein (a scorpion toxin). Those characteristics of the negative modes are determined that correlate with the dynamical (or glass) transition behavior of the protein, as manifested as {{an increase in the}} gradient with T of the average atomic mean-square displacement at ∼ 220 K. The number of negative eigenvalues shows no transition with temperature. Further, although filtering the negative modes to retain only those with eigenvectors corresponding to double-well potentials does reveal a transition in the hydration water, again, no transition in the protein is seen. However, additional filtering of the protein double-well modes, so as to retain only those that, on energy minimization, escape to different regions of configurational space, finally leads to clear protein dynamical transition behavior. Partial minimization of instantaneous configurations is also found to remove nondiffusive imaginary modes. In <b>summary,</b> <b>examination</b> of the form of negative instantaneous normal modes is shown to furnish a physical picture of local diffusive dynamics accompanying the protein glass transition...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To measure {{specialist}} international medical graduates' (SIMGs) {{level of}} learning through participation in guided tutorials, face-to-face or through videoconferencing (VC), {{and the effect}} of tutorial attendance and quality of participation on success in specialist college examinations. Design and setting: Tutorials were conducted at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital between 19 September 2007 and 23 August 2010, and delivered through VC to participants at other locations. Tutorials were recorded and transcribed, and speaker contributions were tagged and ranked using content analysis software. <b>Summary</b> <b>examination</b> results were obtained from the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists. Main outcome measures: Tutorial participation and attendance, and college examination pass and fail rates. Results: Transcripts were obtained for 116 tutorials. The median participation percentage for those who subsequently failed the college examinations was 1 % (interquartile range [IQR], 0 %- 1 %), while for those who passed the exams it was 5 % (IQR, 2 %- 8 %; P < 0. 001). There was also an association between attendance and exam success; the median (IQR) attendance of those who failed was 24 % (IQR, 14 %- 39 %), while for those who passed it was 59 % (IQR, 39 %- 77 %; P < 0. 001).

40|$|<b>Summary.</b> An <b>examination</b> {{has been}} made of the {{composition}} and structural state of the feldspars in each of the units of the Rosses granite complex. The compositions of the plagioclases are systematically related to the compositions ofthe rocks, but the alkali feldspars are much more uniform as a result of postmagmatie recrystalli-zation. In the granites both alkali feldspar and plagioelase are in low-temperature structural states, but alkali feldspar phenoerysts from one of the porphyry dykes associated with the conlplex show a higher-temperature state. T HE geology of the Rosses complex has been described by Pitcher (1953). The complex consists, in order of emplacement, of a peri-pheral assortment of microgranite sheets, an outer ring of biotite-granite (G 1), an intermediate ring of biotite-granite (G 2), a north-south swarm of porphyry dykes, an inner intrusion of biotite-granite (G 3), and a final small intrusion of muscovite-granite (G 4). The G 3 and G 4 granites contain small areas of greisenisation. ~Numerous small sheets of pegmatite and aplite are also present.

40|$|<b>Summary.</b> <b>Examination</b> of {{previous}} physical methods of estimating the barium-content of these feldspars howed {{that they are}} generally unsatisfactory. A new variation diagram is constructed correlating BaO content and values of d 132 de-termined from diffractometer records. It is estimated that the BaO content of these feldspars can normally be determined toabout 2 - 3 % by using this diagram. Some {{of the problems of}} the mineralogy of the series are reviewed {{in the light of the}} experimental results, in particular the effect of polymorphic changes on the variation diagram. Some xperimental evidence of the effect of different structural states upon the value of d 13 2 is obtained, and the limitations imposed upon the method by the existence ofsuch states are discussecl. I nt,r oduction ~ ELDSPARS with appreciable barium contents are thought o form a series from potassium to barium feldspar. Barium-orthoclases, hyalophanes, amt celsians are regarde:t as members of this series, and despite their rarity, their relationships within the series are of some interest, particularly in the light of recent work on the sub-solidus relations in the commoner alkali and plagioelase feldspar series. From time to time individual members of the series have been described, but a systematic study of the series as a whole seems to have been neglected. With this objective, the author began to form a collection of potassium-barium feldspars ome years ago. Whilst this collection is still rather limited, enough specimens are available over the series to allow a pre-liminary survey of the mineralogy to be made. These results will be presented elsewhere, and the present paper is restricted to the attempts to determine and classify the specimens by X-ray powder methods. The rarity of the specimens often meant that they were available only in minute quantities; they were described as hyalophane, celsians, etc., and usually nothing more about heir constitution (in particular the Ba-content) was known. Conventional nalytical procedures cannot be used, and the optical properties of the series are so imperfectly known that the few variation diagrams that have been proposed can only be regarded as speculative (see the comments of Segnit (1946)).

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{principles}} of the semantic organisation of Marulić’s parables and the interpretative models associated with them. This is done firstly through a short look at Marulić’s and general terminological and conceptual definitions of the parable, then through a <b>summary</b> <b>examination</b> of the thematic and macro-composition plan of the parables in the collection, as well as their functional orientation. The further course of the research is directed towards the problematisation of the relations between the literal and the figurative meanings in the parables, which enables us to systematise Marulić’s parables into several relatively homogenous groups. Finally, attention is drawn to the rhetorical and argumentative orientation of these parables, which is set in advance by the parable narrative tradition and confirmed by Marulić’s specific requirement for direct action upon the recipient. The rhetorical and argumentative orientation of Marulić’s parables is confirmed by the choice of the most common low mimetic manner of narrating, which creates the fundamental precondition for imitability, and is causally linked with the generally accepted low character of the parable genre, as well as its horizontal orientation to all sectors of the folk. This does not mean, however, that Marulić meant his parables only for the simple, as he says specifically in his dedication, but, on the contrary, he had in mind recipients who were well versed {{in the tradition of the}} allegorical interpretation of the Bible. The dichotomy of principle - whether Marulić’s parables have a structure of the comparison or the allegory according to Jülicher’s postulates about Jesus’s parables in the Gospels has proved inadequate. At the second level of analysis arises the question of whether in the process of interpretation, explicitly and step by step, he carries out a literal allegorisation and sets up allegorical equations for all the units in question, sets up allegorical equivalences only for the crucial semantic units leaving the others implicitly involved in the discursively linked judgements, or leaves them out completely, sticking only to the central item of the likeness. Marulić’s parables essential have a duality of representation: of the literal and of the figurative. They are divided only in the interpretative proceeding. To discern the laws obtaining between Marulić’s interpretational models and the semantic organisation of the individual parables they are applied to is possible only with a comparison of the relations between the literal and the transferred meaning in the parable with their actualisation in the actual procedure of interpretation. Whether the spiritual (the tropological — moral) meaning is given simultaneously with the literal (the ethical teaching is gathered directly on the surface, i. e. on the literal level of meaning, from the procedure or personal features of the persons that carry out the action), or whether the spiritual meaning is revealed only in the process of interpretation when the literal significance is replaced completely by the spiritual, the parable and its interpretation are primarily imagined as a single unit. From this aspect Marulić’s interpretation cannot be explained as a supplement (Jülicher). His parables demand in advance an interpretation that is shaped as an auto-hermeneutic commentary and can be carried out by various interpretative strategies (one point of comparison, key points of comparison or separate details). What contributes to the aesthetic and rhetorical excellence of Marulić’s parables is the fact that in all the parables and in the interpretation of them a single unique law is confirmed: individual semantic units are primarily related to each other, and only secondary direct attention somewhere outside the jointly superposed subject — the point of the parable, the causally derived conclusion on the basis of the premises that are produced by the actual telling. Separate allegorical equations lead to the creation of a relative independence for individual semantic units and expansions at the cognitive and argumentative level, but never call into question the logical and narrative coherence of the parable itself or the literal level of meaning into which the spiritual meaning is included...|$|E

40|$|<b>SUMMARY</b> An <b>examination</b> of the {{prevalence}} and phenotype of immune disorders in {{different ethnic groups}} may provide important clues to the etiopathogenesis of these disorders. Whilst still conjectural the restricted and some-what unique polymorphisms of the MHC (and other genetic loci involving host defences) of the Australian Aborigi-nes may provide an explanation for their apparent heightened susceptibility to newly encountered infections and their resistance to many (auto) immune and allergic disorders. In comparison with non-Aboriginal Australians, Aus-tralian Aborigines have heightened frequencies of rheumatic fever, systemic lupus erythematosus, various infec-tions and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. In contrast various autoimmune disorders (e. g. rheumatoid arthri-tis, multiple sclerosis, CREST, biliary cirrhosis, coeliac disease, pernicious anaemia, vitiligo), B 27 related ar-thropathies, psoriasis, lymphoproliferative disorders and atopic disorders appear infrequent or absent. Similarly various autoantibodies occur with increased or diminished frequency. With continuing racial admixture, social dep-rivation and deleterious lifestyles of these people {{it is likely that}} further changes in both the frequencies and pheno-type of these immune disorders will occur.

40|$|<b>Summary</b> Histological <b>examination</b> of {{adequate}} biopsy specimens {{is fundamental to}} the management of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). A practical alternative to open biopsy, provided enough tissue can be obtained, has obvious advantages, especially if the lesion in question is deep seated, and might call for laparotomy or thoracotomy. Core biopsy with computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound (US) guidance may be such an alternative, particularly when a spring-loaded firing device is used. Thirty-four biopsies were performed in 26 patients with known or suspected NHL. A primary histological diagnosis was made in 7 / 7 (six NHL, one seminoma). Relapse was confirmed in 15 / 15 patients overall. In patients with follicular NHL, 8 / 15 biopsies showed progression to high grade histology. Biopsies were also performed to assess the nature of residual abnormalities after treatment and to obtain fresh tissue for immunocytochemistry. Tissue was obtained in all cases and a further procedure (two laparotomies, one second needle biopsy) was required on only three occasions. The procedure was well tolerated {{and there were no}} complications. This technique is therefore a valuable alternative to more invasive surgical procedures and may be of major benefit in the management of NHL. Tissue biopsy allowing histological classification is essential for defining the optimal management of patients with non...|$|R
40|$|<b>SUMMARY.</b> An <b>examination</b> of 10 {{strains of}} Staphylococcus aureus for {{survival}} within abscesses developing in the peritoneal cavity of mice revealed three distinct patterns of survival. Although non-haemolytic mutants were destroyed {{more rapidly than}} were their parent strains, this difference could not be attributed to any particular haemolysin. In abscesses generated with mixtures of non-haemolytic variants and their parent strains, the former were preferentially eliminated; {{this suggests that the}} non-haemolytic variants were inherently more sensitive to the conditions within these lesions. Subsequent studies confirmed that abscess homogenates were cidal for staphylococci and that this activity resided in the insoluble fraction of the homogenates. Staphylococci added to abscess homogenates were killed, but only after a lag. This lag could be shortened or eliminated by incubating homogenates before adding the test organism. After development of a suitable assay, {{it was found that the}} cidal activity in abscess homogenates could be increased 3 - 20 -fold by pre-incubation. Staphylococcal strains differed in their relative sensitivities to the cidal material; those strains rapidly destroyed within abscesses were the most sensitive and strains capable of better survival were more resistant. The results support the concept that the cidal material is responsible for destruction of staphylococci within such lesions...|$|R

Arteriolar sheathing was the commonest retinal vessel abnormality, occurring in 30 / 59 (51 %) SS children and in 11 / 37 (30 %) SC children. Peripheral arteriolar closure was observed in 14 (24 %) SS children and in 6 (16 %) SC children. Arteriovenous anastomoses were seen in 3 children, but proliferative retinopathy was not identified. Capillary changes often occurred in patients without confluent closure, suggesting that complex remodelling of the capillary bed may precede retinal non-perfusion. Discrete retinal patches similar to schisis cavities resulting from intraretinal haem-orrhages were found in 22 (37 %) SS children and in 9 (24 %) SC children, but haemorrhages were observed in only 2 patients (1 SS, 1 SC). Vitreous opacities were common and were generally associated with retinal vessel disease. Retinal changes were consistently more common in children with SS disease, though the differences failed to reach statistical significance. The prevalence of peripheral vascular closure and retinal patches showed a significant upward trend with age. These observations contrast with the greater prevalence of proliferative retinopathy characterising S...|$|R
40|$|This upper-level {{undergraduate}} and beginning graduate textbook primarily covers {{the theory and}} application of Newtonian and Lagrangian, but also of Hamiltonian mechanics. In addition, included are elements of continuum mechanics and the accompanying classical field theory, wherein four-vector notation is introduced without explicit reference to special relativity. The author's writing style attempts to ease students through the primary and secondary results, thus building a solid foundation for understanding applications. So the text is thus structured around developments of the main ideas, explicit proofs, and numerous clarifications, comments and applications. Numerous examples illustrate the material and often present alternative approaches to the final results. Frequent references are made linking mechanics to other fields of physics. These lecture notes have been used frequently by students to prepare for written and/or oral <b>examinations.</b> <b>Summaries</b> and problems conclude chapters and appendices supply needed background topics...|$|R
40|$|As {{the number}} of MRI {{laboratories}} equipped with resonance systems featuring magnetic field strengths {{of more than one}} Tesla as well as coils dedicated to breast examinations increases, such examinations are being made at increasing frequency. Clinicians expect the summaries to include exhaustive information concerning the topography of detected lesions as well as approximate staging of the disease process, which helps them in making decisions regarding further management. On the other hand, radiographers performing medical check-ups, expect the previous <b>examination</b> <b>summary</b> to include a wide range of information facilitating comparative analysis and evaluation of scan efficacy. Undoubtedly, breast MR offers an opportunity to obtain aforementioned information. However, the indispensable requirement for preparation of such summary is radiographer's awareness of the expectations being raised. We have to face the difficult task of standardizing the summaries, and even more than that, of making our colleagues {{aware of the importance of}} each sentence included in or excluded from the summary. This article is an attempt to present the correct form of a medical <b>examination</b> <b>summary</b> which should include data concerning former diagnostic examinations, detailed description of morphology as well as the location of lesions being diagnosed and suspected of malignant character together with the assessment of their relation to the skin and fascia as well as infiltration of fascia and chest wall. The essential requirement is the analysis of the contrast enhancement curve as well as the appraisal of diffusion limitation with numerical ADC values. Assessment of lymph nodes is also required, as is the classification of lesions into appropriate BI RADS in summary conclusions. In order to avoid significant differences in the phrasing of summaries prepared at particular centers as well as by particular individuals, a general scheme forming a basis for the summary should be adopted or else, a list of questions to be answered in order to make the summary complete, comprehensible and unambiguous should be developed. Such procedures would certainly make the radiologist's work easier; it would also ensure radiographers being better understood by fellow radiographers and clinicians...|$|R
40|$|The study {{analyzed}} the exposure {{factors that may}} lead to neuropsychological symptoms among 92 workers who were exposed to xylene and toluene and 100 workers who were not exposed to the solvents. The airborne concentration of xylene and toluene was evaluated with personal passive badges. The levels of methyl hippuric acid and hippuric acid in urine were assessed, and interviews were performed to observe the neuropsychological symptoms that may result from exposure to the solvents. The result showed that the average concentration for the exposed group of xylene in the paint company working environment was 2. 7 (SD = 2. 4) [*]ppm and the average concentration of toluene was 9. 5 (SD = 10. 4) [*]ppm. The average level of methyl hippuric acid in urine was 78 (SD = 74. 7) [*]mg/g creatinine. Factors that affected the neuropsychological symptoms included the following. (1) The impact of age: the risk (adjusted odds ratio) for getting psychosomatic symptoms in persons over 40 and exposed to xylene was 9. 5 and the aOR of those exposed to toluene was 8. 3. (2) The impact of not providing personal protective equipment was found to be sleep disturbance; {{it was found that the}} aOR of those exposed to xylene was 3. 9, and the aOR of those exposed to toluene was 4. 4. In <b>summary,</b> periodic <b>examination</b> of workers by occupational physician is needed for detection of early neuropsychological effects, especially psychosomatic symptoms, and sleep disturbances...|$|R

Coutinho-Filho Department of Endodontics, Rio de Janeiro State University, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil De-Deus G, Coutinho-Filho T. The use of white Portland cement as an apical plug in a tooth with a necrotic pulp and wide-open apex: a case report. International Endodontic Journal, 40, 653 – 660, 2007. Aim To present {{a case in}} which substantial periapical healing occurred with the use of white Portland cement (WPC) to create an apical plug in the root of an immature tooth. <b>Summary</b> Radiographic <b>examination</b> indicated an immature tooth (35) with a wide-open apex and a periapical radiolucency. The canal was mechanically cleaned using intracanal instruments and 5 % NaOCl irrigation. Small pieces of resorbable collagen sponge were packed beyond the root apex with the aim of creating a periapical barrier for the compaction of filling material. WPC powder was then mixed with sterile water and delivered to the apical portion of the canal (approximately 3 mm). The patient was asked to return 1 week later for the continuation of treatment but he did return as planned. Seven months after the intervention the patient returned and another radiograph was exposed to reveal complete radiographic healing of the periapical region. The remainder of the canal was filled with thermoplastic gutta-percha. Clinical follow-up 1 year later revealed adequate clinical function, absence of clinical symptoms and no signs of periapical rarefaction. Key learning point • The positive clinical resolution of this case is encouraging for the use of WPC as an apical plug in immature teeth with necrotic pulps and wide-open apices...|$|R
