40|$|The {{influence}} of experimental conditions on polymorphic outcome and transformations during cooling crystallization of carbamazepine (CBZ) from anhydrous ethanol has been investigated. Stirring {{was found to}} be the most important controlling factor for the initial polymorphic outcome in solutions prepared using commercial CBZ powder. For quiescent conditions, a few large crystals of the metastable trigonal α form (II) initially appeared, undergoing subsequent slow transformation into the stable P-monoclinic β form (III). Under sufficiently vigorous stirring, the induction times observed were clearly defined by the onset of turbidity, which was due to formation of a large number of small form III prismatic crystals. In experiments with solutions prepared by using recrystallized CBZ, significantly shorter induction times were observed under stirring conditions: a large number of small form II needle-shaped crystals initially formed at the onset of turbidity and then relatively rapidly transformed to small crystals of form III. This indicates a possible effect of impurities in the commercial CBZ powder inhibiting rapid nucleation of form II under <b>stirring</b> <b>conditions.</b> In situ monitoring of CBZ polymorphic outcome was performed using custom-built experimental setup for simultaneous measurement of intensity of transmitted and scattered light.
