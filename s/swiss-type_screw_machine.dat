40|$|Manufacturers {{around the}} world are {{increasingly}} challenged to make components that are becoming smaller, more precise, more complex, and comprised of many more features. When manufactured components require precision, when they are very complex, or when they have multiple features, especially three dimensional features, manufacturers must often resort to machining. Machining smaller parts, however, can be particularly challenging. In this thesis, the issues associated with machining small parts are examined and a brief overview of the equipment available to machine small parts is considered. A machine tool design is developed which addresses many of the limitations associated with the <b>Swiss-type</b> <b>screw</b> <b>machine.</b> The proposed design is then 2 ̆ 2 virtually prototyped 2 ̆ 2 as a solid model in SolidWorksTM, machining forces are calculated, and the effects of the machining forces on the machine tool design are analyzed utilizing COSMOSWORKSTM FEA software and standard industrial formulas for calculating machine tool component service lives and safety factors. Values for all of the design metrics as well as all of the component service lives were found to meet or exceed their target values, thus the machine tool, if manufactured, is expected to perform robustly and to function as desired...|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of NC, <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> diverged into two classes, {{mechanical}} and NC. This distinction continues today with mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> and CNC <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> However, in shop-floor jargon, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> by itself is still often understood in context to imply a mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machine,</b> so the retronym mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> is not consistently used.|$|R
50|$|The name <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> is {{somewhat}} of a , because <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> {{spend much of their}} time making things that are not screws and that in many cases are not even threaded. However, the archetypal use for which <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> were named was screw-making.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> {{have been}} {{replaced}} to some extent by CNC lathes (turning centers) and CNC <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> However, they are still commonly in operation, and for high-volume production of turned components it is still often true that nothing is as cost-efficient as a mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{definition}} of the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> has changed with changing technology. Any use of the term prior to the 1840s, if it occurred, would have referred ad hoc to any machine tool used to produce screws, that is, {{there would have been no}} established differentiation from the term screw-cutting lathe. When turret lathes were developed in the 1840s, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was applied to them in overlapping usage with the term turret lathe. In 1860, when some of the movements, such as turret indexing, were mechanically automated, the term automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was applied, and the term hand <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> or manual <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was retronymously applied to the earlier machines. Within 15 years, the entire part-cutting cycle had been mechanically automated, and machines of the 1860 type were retronymously called semi-automatic. From that time on, machines with fully automated cycles were usually called automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machines,</b> and eventually, in the usage of most people in the machining industries, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> no longer was used to refer to manual or semi-automatic turret lathes, having become reserved for one class of machine, the fully mechanically automated type. This narrow meaning of <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> remained stable from about the 1890s until the 1950s. (Brown & Sharpe continued to call some of their hand-operated turret lathe models [...] "screw machines", but most machinists reserved the term for automatics.) Within this class called <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> there were variations, such as single-spindle versus multispindle, horizontal-turret versus vertical-turret, etc.|$|R

5000|$|Multispindle lathes {{have more}} than one spindle and {{automated}} control (whether via cams or CNC). They are production machines specializing in high-volume production. The smaller types are usually called <b>screw</b> <b>machines,</b> while the larger variants are usually called automatic chucking machines, automatic chuckers, or simply chuckers. <b>Screw</b> <b>machines</b> usually work from bar stock, while chuckers automatically chuck up individual blanks from a magazine. Typical minimum profitable production lot size on a <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> is in the thousands of parts due to the large setup time. Once set up, a <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> can rapidly and efficiently produce thousands of parts on a continuous basis with high accuracy, low cycle time, and very little human intervention. (The latter two points drive down the unit cost per interchangeable part much lower than could be achieved without these machines.) ...|$|R

40|$|Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is an {{important}} process in industries, especially in the hard disk drive assembly processes. For example, the automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> is one of important machines in the hard disk drive assembly processes. The PMSM is a fundamental component of the automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine.</b> The feedback torque control system use estimated torque received from motor current. The disturbance torque caused by the screw process depends {{on the quality of}} the screw heads and screw holes. The automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> requires precise output torque because the error of output torque affects the automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> performance. The damage in the hard disk drive assembly process may result from an inaccurate output torque. For instance, the defect of product is broken threads of the screws and the out of length of the screw heads. When the control process requires precision output torque, the machines must be calibrated by operator with standard value consumed 20 - 30 minutes per machine. This paper presents a torque control system with an adaptive fuzzy logic compensator for torque control and torque estimation simultaneously. The method of the research can increase the efficiency of torque control system and decrease the calibration time of the automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> Index Terms—Permanent magnet synchronous motor, control theory, observer and adaptive fuzzy logic compensator.

50|$|Speaking with {{reference}} to the normal definition of the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine,</b> all <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> are fully automated, whether mechanically (via cams) or by CNC (computerized control), which means that once they are set up and started running, they continue running and producing parts with very little human intervention. This has been true since the 1870s. Mechanical automation came first, beginning in the 1870s; computerized control (via first NC and then CNC) came later, beginning in the 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|Small- to {{medium-sized}} cam-operated {{automatic lathes}} were (and still are) usually called <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> or automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> These machines work on parts that (as a rough guide only) are usually less than 80 mm {{in diameter and}} less than 300 mm long. <b>Screw</b> <b>machines</b> almost invariably do bar work, which means that an entire length of bar stock (anywhere from 1 to 4 m in length) passes through the spindle and is gripped by the chuck (which is usually a collet chuck). As the part is being machined, {{the entire length of}} bar stock is turning with the spindle. When the part is done, it is [...] "parted off" [...] from the bar, the chuck un-clamps, the bar is fed forward, and the chuck then closes again, ready for the next cycle. The bar-feeding can happen by various means, including pulling-finger tools that grab the bar and pull or roller bar feed that pushes the bar from behind.|$|R

50|$|In the {{hierarchy}} of manufacturing <b>machines,</b> the <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> sits at the top when large product volumes are needed. An engine lathe sits at the bottom, taking {{the least amount of}} time to set up but the most amount of skilled labor and time to actually produce a part. A turret lathe has traditionally been one step above an engine lathe, needing greater set-up time but being able to produce a higher volume of product and usually requiring a lower-skilled operator once the set-up process is complete. <b>Screw</b> <b>machines</b> may require an extensive set-up, but once they are running, a single operator can monitor the operation of several machines.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{two-phase}} screw expanders {{in power}} generation cycles can achieve {{an increase in the}} utilisation of available energy from a low-temperature heat source when compared with more conventional single-phase turbines. The efficiency of <b>screw</b> expander <b>machines</b> is sensitive to expansion volume ratio, which, for given inlet and discharge pressures, increases as the expander inlet vapour dryness fraction decreases. For single-stage <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> with low inlet dryness, this can lead to underexpansion of the working fluid and low isentropic efficiency. The cycle efficiency can potentially be improved by using a two-stage expander, consisting of a machine for low-pressure expansion and a smaller high-pressure machine connected in series. By expanding the working fluid over two stages, the built-in volume ratios of the two machines can be selected to provide a better match with the overall expansion process, thereby increasing the efficiency. The mass flow rate though both stages must be matched, and the compromise between increasing efficiency and maximising power output must also be considered. This study is based on the use of a rigorous thermodynamic <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> model to compare the performance of single- and two-stage expanders. The model allows optimisation of the required intermediate pressure in the two-stage expander, along with the built-in volume ratio of both <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> stages. The results allow specification of a two-stage machine, using either two <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> or a combination of high-pressure screw and low-pressure turbine, in order to achieve maximum efficiency for a particular power output. For the low-temperature heat recovery application considered in this paper, the trilateral flash cycle using a two-stage expander and the Smith cycle using a high-pressure screw and low-pressure turbine are both predicted to achieve a similar overall conversion efficiency to that of a conventional saturated vapour organic Rankine cycle...|$|R
