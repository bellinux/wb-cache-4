40|$|Photochemically induced dynamic nuclear {{polarisation}} {{has been}} observed from entire photosynthetic units (PSUs) bound to chromatophore membrane (membrane-bound PSU) of the purple bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides, which have been selectively 13 C-isotope enriched at all BChl and BPheo cofactors. These 1. 5 MDa membrane-bound protein complexes comprise reaction centres {{as well as the}} antenna systems called light harvesting complexes I and II. Due to light-induced enhancement of nuclear polarisation, the 13 C magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum shows absorptive lines originating from the cofactors involved into the photochemical machinery and allowing the determination of the electronic ground state structure at atomic resolution. Addition of detergent released intact PSU from the chromatophore membrane (so called detergent <b>solubilised</b> PSU) and caused significant changes in the sign and intensity pattern of the light-induced MAS NMR spectrum. In contrast, detergent <b>solubilised</b> PSU and detergent <b>solubilised</b> bacterial reaction centres with the same isotope label pattern exhibit essentially the same chemical shifts with only minor differences in the intensity pattern. The pronounced differences between intact membrane-bound and detergent <b>solubilised</b> PSU are tentatively explained by the loss of self-orientation of the membrane-bound samples by solubilisation.

40|$|In {{this brief}} essay, {{one of the}} most common and least {{appreciated}} challenge in the field is addressed. Few chemists, particularly supramolecular chemists, exist who are not all too familiar with solubility problems during the synthesis of new molecules. Solubility problems are inherent to the synthesis of molecules that are made to build supramolecular architectures because the same intermolecular interactions that cause the problem are later on essential for the final self-assembly of the system of interest. Naturally, many solutions exist for a problem that occurs so frequently. They are used as daily routine in many laboratories, the temporary attachment of hydrophobic bulk of various size and nature being the most common. However, contrary to the comparable situation with protecting groups, these <b>solubilising</b> groups are generally underappreciated, often communicated orally as one of those precious 'lab secrets' that nobody really takes serious but everybody really needs to get things running and reach the relevant part of the research project. Here, we briefly try to summarise latent concepts concerning <b>solubilising</b> groups, focusing particularly on questions concerning quantitative aspects and the removal of <b>solubilising</b> groups for self-assembly with pre-, post- or in situ desolubilisation, and provide a simple practical example with tert-butyldiphenylsilyl as an illustrative <b>solubilising</b> group...|$|R

He introduced radiolabelled SAP as a diagnostic in-vivo tracer for amyloid, which has revolutionised knowledge of the natural history of amyloidosis and its response to treatment.
