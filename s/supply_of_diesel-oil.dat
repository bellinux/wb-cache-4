An evaluation of soil biological activities as a monitoring instrument for the decontamination process <b>of</b> <b>diesel-oil</b> contaminated soil was made using measurements of organic carbon content, soil microbial respiration, soil ATP and dehydrogenase, ß-glucosidase, lipase enzyme activities. Five samples were used: S (control, uncontaminated soil), CS (contaminated soil), SCS (sterilized contaminated soil), CFS (contaminated soil plus N and P), CCS (contaminated soil plus compost). The relationships between soil parameters and the levels of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) residues were investigated. Results showed that inorganic nutrients NP and compost stimulated hydrocarbon biodegradation but not all biological activities to a significant extent. The residual hydrocarbon trend was positively related {{with that of the}} organic C content, microbial respiration and with β-glucosydase activity, while both soil lipase and dehydrogenase activities were negatively related with the hydrocarbon trend.

In addition, the results of its combustion also releases GHG to the environment. One {{way to reduce the}} use {{of fossil fuels}} is produce bio-oil through pyrolysis technology. Ketapang rod is a huge potential used as feedstock for bio-oil production because its high cellulose content (41. 80 %). Synthesis of bio-oil from Ketapang stem begins with the process of size reduction of biomass and natural zeolite to - 100 + 200 mesh size. Then, into the natural zeolite impregnated Ni and Mo to form the bimetallic catalyst NiMo/NZA. The catalyst is then activated through the stages of calcination, oxidation, and reduction. Pyrolysis process is done by varying the weight percentage of catalyst to biomass, ie: 1. 5 %, 2 %, 2. 5 %, and 3 % w/w. In addition, the catalytic pyrolysis process is carried 3 % NZA only and 3 % NiMo/NZA were activated by calcination process alone. The highest yield was obtained on the use of catalysts NiMo/NZA perfect activated which amounted to 91. 05 %. From physics analysis performed on the bio-oil obtained: density of 0. 91 g/ml, viscosity 10. 839 cSt, acid number 46. 954 mg NaOH/g sample, flash point 52 oC, and the heating value 42. 66 MJ/Kg.

For analysis, OLS technique is used covering time series data for the years 1975 - 76 to 2006 - 07 that was made stationary by Durbin-Watson criterion. AR (1) is used to check autocorrelation.

This paper proposes using variation in traffic safety laws an instrumental variable for the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> cadaveric donors.

Using panel data from 1988 - 2008, we find that a 1 % decrease in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> cadaveric donors per 100, 000 individuals increases the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> living donors per 100, 000 individuals between 0. 36 % to 0. 54 %. On average, a decrease of four to five cadaveric donations causes an increase of one living kidney donation. Disaggregate living donors into biological donors and non-biological donors, we find the strongest effect is among nonbiological donors known to the organ recipient. A 1 % increase in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> cadaveric donors decrease the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> kidney donations from this group by 1. 54 %.

The effects of competitive pressures and past charity care provision on the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> philanthropic donations to nonprofit hospitals are also examined. Empirical models <b>of</b> the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> donations and charity care are specified and estimated using data on nonprofit hospitals in Florida for the years 1980 - 1984.

The results from the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> donations models suggest that philanthropic donations will alleviate the competitive pressures to a small degree. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} how {{liquidity}} premia {{are affected by}} the <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> various types of assets. Specifically, we examine how the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> government debt affects the real interest rate and the liquidity premium in the economy. More importantly, we examine how the financial sector satisfies the demand for liquidity by transforming illiquid assets into liquid assets, and thereby how the private <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> liquid assets is affected by the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> government debt. We also show that a rise in uncertainty (i. e., risk premia) hampers the ability of financial institutions to provide liquid assets, and hence may lead to a contraction in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> liquid assets in addition to a rise in the liquidity premium. Hence, this paper establishes a close connection between risk premia and liquidity premia. This feature arises naturally out of our model, and as well seems to be a reasonable characterization of current events. The end result is a general equilibrium model that endogenizes the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> liquid assets and their rate of return. Using quarterly U.
