5|$|One of {{the most}} {{depressing}} sections of Chicago is the Uptown area on the North Side. Shabby apartment buildings, vacant stores, wino bars, littered vacant lots, junkies, muggers, and career down-and-outers. It also has a new alderman, Helen Shiller, {{and she has a}} vision of what that <b>seedy</b> old neighborhood should be in the future. And apparently her vision is that Uptown should remain a <b>seedy</b> old neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, {{the area around}} the station became known for its <b>seedy</b> and downmarket character, and was used as a {{backdrop}} for several films as a result. There was major redevelopment in the 21st century, including restoration of the original roof, and the station became well known for its association with the Harry Potter books and films, particularly the fictional Platform 9¾.|$|E
5|$|The 1986 crime drama film Mona Lisa is set around King's Cross. At the time, the downmarket and <b>seedy</b> area {{surrounding}} the station, coupled with urban decay, {{made it an}} ideal location. Subsequent early 1990s tabloid coverage of crime and prostitution around King's Cross referred back to the film.|$|E

5|$|Recorded {{over six}} weeks in late 2004, Commit This to Memory was created largely at <b>Seedy</b> Underbelly Studios, a {{suburban}} home converted into a studio in Los Angeles' Valley Village region. The album was written partially in their hometown of Minneapolis and partially in Los Angeles, during {{a period in which}} frontman Justin Pierre was seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. He hoped for his lyricism to better emphasize storytelling, inspired by the lyrics of Tom Waits, Ben Folds and John K. Samson. Hoppus mainly worked with the band on completing song arrangements.|$|E
5|$|After {{performing}} at Wave Aid, Silverchair reunited and by late 2005 began preparations {{for their next}} studio album, Young Modern. Johns had written about 50 songs during the hiatus for a possible solo album or other project but decided to use them for Silverchair. In 2006, after five weeks practice the group demoed tracks in the Hunter Region, and then recorded at Los Angeles' <b>Seedy</b> Underbelly Studios with Launay as producer. Parks again arranged orchestral tracks for the band – they travelled to Prague to record with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. The group also used Mac, Luke Steele (The Sleepy Jackson) and Julian Hamilton (The Presets, The Dissociatives) – Hamilton also co-wrote songs with Johns. Silverchair self-funded the album's production to ease the pressures faced previously when working with a record label.|$|E
5|$|Irma Johnson is {{the sister}} of the late Warren Johnson and Eve Russell's aunt. When she was young, Eve had a close {{relationship}} with her aunt because of their love of gospel music. Irma is proud of Eve's singing in the church's choir; she discouraged Eve from singing jazz and blues music, calling them sinful. Their relationship became strained when Irma saw a drugged and intoxicated Eve singing in a <b>seedy</b> Boston jazz club and cavorting with several men. Irma disowns Eve when she discovers her relationship with Julian, who is white, and her pregnancy with his child. Eve and Irma did not speak for nearly 20 years. Eve paid for Irma to live in a retirement home, but told everyone she had no living relatives in an attempt to keep her past secret.|$|E

This is much to the annoyance of Nicky's trade unionist father Felix (Peter Vaughan), who does not want his son to waste opportunities that he never had when he was Nicky's age. Nicky's relationship with Mary ends when she becomes pregnant by Tosker and later marries him, which means she also drops out of university. On the run from a pregnant girlfriend himself and his abusive alcoholic father, Geordie leaves for London, where he falls in with <b>seedy</b> underworld baron Benny Barrett (Malcolm McDowell).|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, Alexandria County (renamed Arlington County in 1920), the county in Virginia closest to Washington, D.C., was a predominantly rural area. Part of the original ten-mile-square District of Columbia, the land now comprising the county was retroceded to Virginia in a July 9, 1846, act of Congress that took effect in 1847. Most of the county is hilly, and at the time, most of the county's population was concentrated in the city of Alexandria, at the far southeastern corner of the county. In 1861, the rest of the county largely consisted of scattered farms, the occasional house, fields for grazing livestock, and Arlington House, owned by Mary Custis, wife of Robert E. Lee. The county was connected to nearby Washington via the Long Bridge, which spanned the Potomac River. On the river flats of the Virginia side of the river was Jackson City, a <b>seedy</b> entertainment district named after President Andrew Jackson and home to several racetracks, gambling halls, and saloons.|$|E
5|$|Fort Jackson was an American Civil War-era {{fortification}} in Virginia that {{defended the}} southern end of the Long Bridge, near Washington, D.C. Long Bridge connected Washington, D.C. to Northern Virginia and served as a vital transportation artery for the Union Army during the war. Fort Jackson was named for Jackson City, a <b>seedy</b> suburb of Washington that had been established on the south side of the Long Bridge in 1835. It was built in the days immediately following the Union Army's occupation of Northern Virginia in May 1861. The fort was initially armed with four cannon used to protect the bridge, but these were removed after the completion of the Arlington Line, a line of defenses built to the south. After 1862, the fort lacked weapons except for small arms and consisted of a wooden palisade backed by earthworks. Two cannon were restored to the fort in 1864 following the Battle of Fort Stevens. The garrison consisted of a single company of Union soldiers who inspected traffic crossing the bridge and guarded it from potential saboteurs.|$|E

5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and <b>seedy</b> bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E
5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} Blue Velvet. The most {{consistent}} symbolism {{in the film}} is an insect motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the <b>seedy</b> underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E
5|$|Oxford Street changed {{character}} from residential to retail {{towards the end}} of the 19th century. Drapers, cobblers and furniture stores began to appear on the street, and were later expanded into the first department stores. Street vendors began to sell tourist souvenirs on the street during this time. A plan of Oxford Street in Tallis's London Street Views, published in the late 1830s, remarks that almost all the street, save for the far western end, was primarily retail. John Lewis started in 1864 as a small shop at No.132, while Selfridges opened on 15 March 1909 at No.400. Most of the southern side of Oxford Street west of Davies Street was completely rebuilt between 1865 and 1890, allowing a more uniform freehold ownership. By the 1930s, the street was almost entirely retail, a position that remains today. However, unlike nearby streets such as Bond Street and Park Lane, there remained a <b>seedy</b> element including street traders and prostitutes. Aside from a number of fixed places on the street, there are no provisions for selling licensed goods on Oxford Street. The advent of closed-circuit television has reduced the attraction of the area to scam artists and illegal street traders.|$|E

5|$|The band joined Blink-182 for a European trek {{in early}} 2004, at the {{recommendation}} of Blink-182's bassist Mark Hoppus. Cain invited Hoppus to produce the band's sophomore album, and he accepted. In late 2004, the band continued touring internationally with Blink-182, this time in Japan. The group accumulated significant buzz, and were regarded as a must-see act on the Warped Tour 2004. The band recorded their second album, Commit This to Memory at <b>Seedy</b> Underbelly Studios, a suburban home converted into a studio in Los Angeles' Valley Village region. The album was written partially in their hometown of Minneapolis and partially in Los Angeles, during {{a period in which}} Pierre was seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. Commit This to Memory was the first album by the band to feature material crafted by each musician in the group, as previous releases had featured songs written in the years prior to each member joining. For this album, the band also had more time and funds create the album. During the recording of the album, the band embarked on their first headlining tour, The Sub-Par Punk Who Cares Tour 2004. By the end of 2004, the band played in over 270 shows that year.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania Avenue (often known {{simply as}} The Avenue) and Fremont Avenue were the major scenes for Baltimore's black musicians from the 1920s to the 1950s, and was an early home for Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, among others. Baltimore had long been a major stop on the black touring circuit, and jazz musicians {{frequently}} played on Pennsylvania Avenue {{on the way to}} or from engagements in New York. Pennsylvania Avenue attracted African Americans {{from as far away as}} North Carolina, and was known for its vibrant entertainment and nightlife, as well as a more <b>seedy</b> side, home to prostitution, violence, ragtime and jazz, which were perceived as unsavory. The single most important venue for outside acts was the Royal Theatre, which was one of the finest African American theaters in the country when it was opened as the Douglass Theater, and was part of the popular performing circuit that included the Earle in Philadelphia, the Howard in Washington, D.C., the Regal in Chicago and the Apollo Theater in New York; like the Apollo, the audience at the Royal Theater was known for cruelly receiving those performers who didn't live up to their standards. Music venues were segregated, though not without resistance - a 1910 tour featuring Bert Williams resulted in an African American boycott of a segregated theater, hoping the threat of lost business from the popular show would cause a change in policy. Pennsylvania Avenue was also a center for black cultural and economic life in Baltimore, and was home to numerous schools, theaters, churches and other landmarks. The street's nightclubs and other entertainment venues were most significant however, including the Penn Hotel, the first African American-owned hotel in Baltimore (built in 1921). Even the local bars and other establishments that didn't feature live music as a major feature generally had a solo pianist or organist. The first local bar to specialize in jazz was Club Tijuana. Major music venues at this time included Ike Dixon's Comedy Club, Skateland, Gamby's, Wendall's Tavern, The New Albert Dreamland, the Ritz, and most importantly, the Sphinx Club. The Sphinx Club became one of the first minority-owned nightclubs in the United States when it opened in 1946, founded by Charles Phillip Tilghman, a local businessman.|$|E
