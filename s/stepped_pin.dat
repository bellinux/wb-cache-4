The effect of Friction Stir Welding process parameters on the mechanical properties of the AA 2014 -T 6 alloy joints produced by friction stir welding have been discussed in this study.

40|$|Crystal growth {{inhibition}} by non-incorporating impurities {{has been described}} and quantified since 1958 by the so-called <b>step</b> <b>pinning</b> model by Cabrera and Vermilyea [1]. In the original model, {{as well as in}} its recent improvements by Weaver et al. in 2006 and 2007 [2, 3], only the inhibition by the adsorption of impurities on crystal surfaces with fixed compositions is considered. However, most of the crystals found in nature are solid solutions with more or less wide chemical variability. Therefore, in order to provide more realistic models of crystal {{growth inhibition}} in natural systems, it is fundamental to study in detail the inhibition of surfaces of solid solutions by non-incorporating impurities. In this paper, the Cabrera–Vermilyea model has been generalised for the case of growth inhibition in solid solution–aqueous solution (SS–AS) systems. This generalisation was made by considering that supersaturation and the physicochemical properties of the solid solutions are functions of the solid composition. The main implication of the model is that a progressive inhibition of growth of a solid solution by increasing the concentration of an adsorbed impurity results in compositional changes on the growing surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Many of the {{interesting}} mechanical and materials properties of the mollusk shell are thought to stem from the prismatic calcite crystal assemblies within this composite structure. It is now evident that proteins {{play a major role}} in the formation of these assemblies. Recently, a superfamily of 7 conserved prismatic layer-specific mollusk shell proteins, Asprich, were sequenced, and the 42 AA C-terminal sequence region of this protein superfamily was found to introduce surface voids or porosities on calcite crystals in vitro. Using AFM imaging techniques, we further investigate the effect that this 42 AA domain (Fragment- 2) and its constituent subdomains, DEAD- 17 and Acidic- 2, have on the morphology and growth kinetics of calcite dislocation hillocks. We find that Fragment- 2 adsorbs on terrace surfaces and <b>pins</b> acute <b>steps,</b> accelerates then decelerates the growth of obtuse steps, forms clusters and voids on terrace surfaces, and transforms calcite hillock morphology from a rhombohedral form to a rounded one. These results mirror yet are distinct from some of the earlier findings obtained for nacreous polypeptides. The subdomains Acidic- 2 and DEAD- 17 were found to accelerate then decelerate obtuse steps and induce oval rather than rounded hillock morphologies. Unlike DEAD- 17, Acidic- 2 does form clusters on terrace surfaces and exhibits stronger obtuse velocity inhibition effects than either DEAD- 17 or Fragment- 2. Interestingly, a 1 : 1 mixture of both subdomains induces an irregular polygonal morphology to hillocks, and exhibits the highest degree of acute <b>step</b> <b>pinning</b> and obtuse <b>step</b> velocity inhibition. This suggests that there is some interplay between subdomains within an intra (Fragment- 2) or intermolecular (1 : 1 mixture) context, and sequence interplay phenomena may be employed by biomineralization proteins to exert net effects on crystal growth and morphology...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work three topics are {{outlined}} which are connected via biomineralisation. The {{investigation of the}} mechanical response of brachiopod shell material, the macroscopic calcite crystal growth, and the microscopic calcite crystal growth are discussed. Brachiopod shells have been investigated with nanoindentation and scanning electron microscopy to determine the material properties {{and the effects of}} the microstructure on the material properties. Brachiopod shells are highly optimised fibre composite materials. The material properties are adapted to the local material demands. The calcitic brachiopod Megerlia truncata exhibits a hard primary layer and a softer secondary layer with a tendency to higher hardness at the inner shell margin. At the hinge region the hardness is considerably higher and reflects the possibly high abrasive wear. The phosphatic brachiopod shells of Lingula anatina and Discradisca stella have laminated architecture with alternating hard and soft layers. They are harder in the center and have softer, more flexible regions at the margins. The macroscopic crystal growth of calcite was performed in gels. The obtained crystals were investigated with scanning electron microscopy. With inert pore solutions the { 104 } rhombohedron is the dominating habit. Succinic acid and aspartic acid inhibit the acute steps of the calcite { 104 } surface. In combination with Mg^ 2 + and Sr^ 2 + one side divergant forms are obtained. Pore solutions containing silicic acids produce catastrophic nucleation. Crystal aggregates from calcite, aragonite, and vaterite develop. The aggregates have morphological similarities with calcites from travertines. Mg^ 2 + and Sr^ 2 + counteract the effect of silicic acids. The microscopic crystal growth of the calcite { 104 } surface was investigated with the atomic force microscope in the presence of silicic acids. The two dimensional nucleation is enhanced. The form of the hillocks change from the additive free rhomb to lenses with increasing silicic acids concentrations. The step velocities increase from 0 ppm to 20 ppm silicic acids and decrease after 20 ppm. Therefore silicic acids possess a promoter and a inhibitor effect on calcite crystal growth. The inhibitory effect can be fitted by a Langmuir isotherm. Both effects can be fitted together with a polynom of rank three. For supersaturation β = 30 the step velocities are constant.

40|$|Isotopically enriched 28 Si is {{an ideal}} {{material}} for solid state quantum computing because it interacts weakly with the spin states of embedded qubits (quantum bits) resulting in long coherence times. This {{is the result of}} eliminating the roughly 4. 7 % 29 Si isotopes present in natural abundance Si, which possesses nuclear spin I = 1 / 2 that is disruptive to qubit operation. However, high-quality 28 Si is scarce {{and the degree to which}} it improves the performance of a qubit is not well understood. This leads to an important question in the Si-based quantum information field, which can be stated as "how good is good enough?" regarding the perfection of 28 Si as a host medium for qubits. The focus of this thesis is to engineer a material that can address this question, specifically in terms of the enrichment. Secondary requirements for ideal 28 Si films that are also pursued are crystalline perfection and high chemical purity. I report on the production and characterization of 28 Si thin films that are the most highly enriched of any known 28 Si material ever produced with a maximum 28 Si enrichment of 99. 9999819 (35) % and a residual 29 Si isotopic concentration of 1. 27 (29) x 10 ^- 7. A hyperthermal energy ion beamline is used to produce this extreme level of enrichment starting from a natural abundance silane gas (SiH 4) source. The Si is enriched in situ by mass separating the ions in a magnetic field just before deposition onto Si(100) substrates. Initial proof of principle experiments enriching 22 Ne and 12 C were also conducted. In the course of achieving this 28 Si enrichment, I also pursue the epitaxial deposition of 28 Si thin films. Characterizations of the film morphology and crystallinity are presented showing that smooth, epitaxial 28 Si films are achieved using deposition temperatures between 349 C and 460 C. Crystalline defects present in these films include { 111 } stacking faults. When using higher deposition temperatures, I find that trace impurity compounds such as SiC cause <b>step</b> <b>pinning</b> and faceting of the growth surface leading to severely rough films. Assessments of the chemical purity of 28 Si films are also presented, which show major impurities N, C, and O are present in the purest film at an atomic concentration of approximately 1 x 10 ^ 19 cm^- 3, resulting in a Si purity of 99. 96 (2) %. Additionally, I introduce a model that describes the residual 29 Si and 30 Si in 28 Si films, i. e. the enrichment, as the result of adsorption of diffusive natural abundance SiH 4 gas from the ion source into the 28 Si films during deposition. This model correlates the measured enrichments of 28 Si films with the SiH 4 partial pressures during deposition. An incorporation fraction for SiH 4 adsorption at room temperature of s = 6 : 8 (3) x 10 ^- 4 is extracted.

Depending on the case, cells are represented as square or arbitrary polygons, which share with the neighboring cells the edges that represent the interface through which the cells communicate. Each edge thus corresponds {{to a pair of}} membranes with the associated wall. The model equations take into account the variation in cell and interface size present in the cellular template model. Our model treats cells as single compartments and does not explicitly simulate internal auxin gradients within a cell or the diffusion of auxin in the extracellular space. In the shoot meristem, where the cells are small and have thin walls, this is likely a reasonable approximation (Kramer 2006). In a review of computer models of auxin transport, Kramer (Kramer 2008) discusses {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} this and other approaches. Based on assumptions 1 - 5 in the main text, a set of coupled ordinary differential equations is used to model the production and decay of auxin (IAA) and PIN 1 proteins, as well as the diffusion and transport of IAA. Numerical integration is performed using the forward Euler method. At the beginning of each simulation time <b>step,</b> all <b>PIN</b> 1 proteins in each cell are allocated to cell membrane sections based on a combination of the flux across the interface and the concentration of auxin in the neighboring cells. It is assumed that relocalization of PIN 1 is fast compared to the length of the simulation step, and therefore the system operates in a quasi steady-state with respect to PIN 1 allocation. The change in the total amount of PIN contained in a cell is given by d PIN d...|$|R
50|$|The {{main event}} for the night saw John Cena face Brock Lesnar in an Extreme Rules match; this was Lesnar's first match in WWE since 2004. The match, {{refereed}} by Charles Robinson, started with Lesnar causing Cena to bleed with a vicious elbow to his head after a double leg takedown. Lesnar continued to dominate the match, delivering punches, clotheslines and knee strikes to Cena; the match had to be paused twice while a medic attended to Cena {{to clean up the}} blood. After the match restarted for the second time, Lesnar continued to brutalize Cena, hanging him from the turnbuckles and throwing him into the steel steps and the guardrail. Cena desperately went for his finishing move, the Attitude Adjustment, but Lesnar countered into his own finishing move, the F-5. While throwing Cena to the mat, however, Lesnar inadvertently caused Cena to hit and knock out the referee. By the time another referee got to the ring to make the count, Cena was able to kick out at two. Lesnar then brought the metal ring steps into the ring and put a kimura lock on Cena while on the steps. Cena lifted and slammed Lesnar onto the metal steps to break the hold. After Lesnar avoided a Cena diving leg drop bulldog, Lesnar charged and leapt off the ring steps and over the top rope onto Cena, sending both men to the floor. When Lesnar tried the same move again, Cena countered by hitting Lesnar {{in the head with a}} metal chain, bloodying Lesnar. A re-energized Cena then delivered an Attitude Adjustment to Lesnar onto the metal <b>steps</b> and <b>pinned</b> him. Following his victory, a bloodied Cena, selling an arm injury, said that he would go home for a vacation.|$|R
40|$|Protein folding {{barriers}} {{result from}} a combination of factors including unavoidable energetic frustration from nonnative interactions, natural variation and selection of the amino acid sequence for function, and/or selection pressure against aggregation. The rate-limiting <b>step</b> for human <b>Pin</b> 1 WW domain folding is the formation of the loop 1 substructure. The native conformation of this six-residue loop positions side chains that are important for mediating protein–protein interactions through the binding of Pro-rich sequences. Replacement of the wild-type loop 1 primary structure by shorter sequences with a high propensity to fold into a type-I′ β-turn conformation or the statistically preferred type-I G 1 bulge conformation accelerates WW domain folding by almost an order of magnitude and increases thermodynamic stability. However, loop engineering to optimize folding energetics has a significant downside: it effectively eliminates WW domain function according to ligand-binding studies. The energetic contribution of loop 1 to ligand binding appears to have evolved at the expense of fast folding and additional protein stability. Thus, the two-state barrier exhibited by the wild-type human Pin 1 WW domain principally results from functional requirements, rather than from physical constraints inherent to even the most efficient loop formation process...|$|R
40|$|Calcium oxalate {{monohydrate}} (COM), {{which plays}} a functional role in plant physiology, {{is a source}} of chronic human disease, forming the major inorganic component of kidney stones. Understanding molecular mechanisms of biological control over COM crystallization is central to development of effective stone disease therapies and can help define general strategies for synthesizing biologically inspired materials. To date, research on COM modification by proteins and small molecules has not resolved the molecular-scale control mechanisms. Moreover, because proteins directing COM inhibition have been identified and sequenced, they provide a basis for general physiochemical investigations of biomineralization. Here, we report molecular-scale views of COM modulation by two urinary constituents, the protein osteopontin and citrate, a common therapeutic agent. Combining force microscopy with molecular modeling, we show that each controls growth habit and kinetics by <b>pinning</b> <b>step</b> motion on different faces through specific interactions in which both size and structure determine the effectiveness. Moreover, the results suggest potential for additive effects of simultaneous action by both modifiers to inhibit the overall growth of the crystal and demonstrate the utility of combining molecular imaging and modeling tools for understanding events underlying aberrant crystallization in disease...|$|R
