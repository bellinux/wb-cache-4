50|$|The Archaeological Park houses many magmatic megaliths, {{or large}} rock formations, {{that the local}} people have personified with human characters. Archaeological finds in the park include stone <b>sharpening</b> <b>tools</b> and Neolithic period rock art.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of ways of <b>sharpening</b> <b>tools.</b> Malleable metal {{surfaces}} such as bronze, iron and mild steel may be formed by beating or peening a flat surface into a sharp edge which incidentally causes work hardening.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{storytelling}} probably {{originates in}} simple chants [...] People sang chants {{as they worked}} at grinding corn or <b>sharpening</b> <b>tools.</b> Our early ancestors created myths to explain natural occurrences. They assigned superhuman qualities to ordinary people, thus originating the hero tale.|$|R
50|$|The second {{cabin in}} Richwood {{was built by}} {{blacksmith}} Absolom Carney {{on the corner of}} East Bomford and Franklin Streets. His cabin had two rooms, the larger of which was for his blacksmithing shop. He mainly <b>sharpened</b> <b>tools</b> and shoed horses.|$|R
50|$|James Henry Leeke {{established}} Leekes as {{a blacksmith}} in Tonypandy in the Rhondda Valley, Wales in 1897. James Leeke initially operated a smithy for <b>sharpening</b> <b>tools</b> {{at the rear}} of the house and then opened a small ironmongery business in the front room.|$|R
25|$|But the {{majority}} {{held that the}} employer required workers {{to be on the}} premises prior and subsequent to the scheduled working hours. Some of this time was clearly spent on work such as preparatory activities such as putting on aprons, <b>sharpening</b> <b>tools</b> and turning on machinery.|$|R

25|$|There is {{support for}} several methods of {{sharpening}} and blurring images, including the blur and <b>sharpen</b> <b>tool.</b> The unsharp mask tool {{is used to}} sharpen an image selectively— it only sharpens areas of an image that are sufficiently detailed. The Unsharp Mask tool is considered to give more targeted results for photographs than a normal sharpening filter. The Selective Gaussian Blur tool works in a similar way, except it blurs areas of an image with little detail.|$|R
50|$|It {{is usually}} an {{unwanted}} piece {{of material and}} is removed with a deburring tool in a process called 'deburring'. Burrs are most commonly created by machining operations, such as grinding, drilling, milling, engraving or turning. It may {{be present in the}} form of a fine wire on the edge of a freshly <b>sharpened</b> <b>tool</b> or as a raised portion of a surface; this type of burr is commonly formed when a hammer strikes a surface. Deburring accounts for a significant portion of manufacturing costs.|$|R
50|$|The {{pictures}} at Newspaper Rock were inscribed {{into the dark}} coating on the rock, called desert varnish. Desert varnish is a blackish manganese-iron deposit that gradually forms on exposed sandstone cliff faces owing to the action of rainfall and bacteria. The ancient artists produced the many types of figures and patterns by carefully pecking the coated rock surfaces with <b>sharpened</b> <b>tools</b> to remove the desert varnish and expose the lighter rock beneath. The older figures are themselves becoming darker in color as new varnish slowly develops.|$|R
5000|$|A {{weatherboard}} clad {{building at}} 32 King Street, with folding garage doors and a saw tooth roof, {{was constructed in}} 1962 as an office for Jeanette Alfredson, and {{was known as the}} [...] "front office" [...] of the joinery. Behind the office was an area for <b>sharpening</b> <b>tools,</b> and underneath were quarters for the single men. Part of the building was used as a garage, and it still has a maintenance pit in the floor under a trapdoor. This building is not included within the heritage boundary.|$|R
60|$|It was a still evening, {{and again}} the {{afterglow}} flamed behind the western pines, when, holding Cæsar's rein, I stood under a hemlock talking to Grace Carrington. We had been compelled to wait for more ironwork, and I made the long journey on the specious excuse of visiting a certain blacksmith who was skilled in <b>sharpening</b> <b>tools.</b> Calvert's offer of hospitality was now proving an inestimable boon. Harry pointed out {{that we had a}} man in camp who could do the work equally well, but I found a temporary deafness convenient then.|$|R
50|$|Located on the London to Holyhead A5 road (Great Britain), Ogwen {{developed}} as a stage coach inn and the present stores building was once stabling for horses. The nearby Tin Can Alley {{was a source of}} honing stones used to <b>sharpen</b> <b>tools</b> during the construction of the A5 by Thomas Telford. This mammoth project started in 1815 and it was 1836 by the time the first mail coach crossed the Menai Straits via Telford’s bridge. Telford designed the milestones and the hexagonal toll houses every five miles. Toll houses survive in Capel Curig and Bethesda, Wales whilst in the middle stands Ogwen.|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} the {{investigation}} is hard-carbide tipped welding-on tools. The purpose is increasing the capacity and quality of <b>sharpening</b> hard-carbide welding-on <b>tools</b> through optimization of the structural characteristics of diamond wheels. The interrelation between the capacity and quality of sharpening has been established. Methods of assigning sharpening conditions and an algorithm used for determination of the characteristics have been devised; a proximate method of evaluation of the serviceability has been developed. Means of obtaining porous structures have been broken down; a mathematical model used for a strength analysis has been constructed. The results have been introduced at Production Complex "Uraltransmash". The capacity has been insreased twice; the durability of the <b>sharpened</b> <b>tools</b> has become 1, 25 higher; the wear resistance of the test wheels is on the average 1, 8 times higherAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
25|$|Employees {{were given}} 14 minutes between each shift to punch the time clock, walk to their {{respective}} workbench and prepare for work. It took a minimum of eight minutes for all the employees to get by the time clock. The estimated walking time for employees ranged from 30 seconds to three minutes, but some workers needed {{as many as eight}} minutes to reach their workbenches. Upon arriving at their workbench, employees were required to put on aprons or overalls, removed shirts, tape or grease arms, put on finger cots, prepare equipment, turn on switches, open windows, and/or assemble or <b>sharpen</b> <b>tools.</b> Such preparatory activities consumed three to four minutes.|$|R
50|$|A Helicopter {{drop point}}, or drop point {{is similar to}} a helispot, but used for depositing, often via longline, and caching supplies. Helicopters and supply {{vehicles}} use the drop point to off-load supplies at the edge of an incident for the ground teams to come by and pick up. Drop points may be located all around the fire. Wildland firefighters will usually pick up <b>sharpened</b> <b>tools,</b> pumps and hoses, water, food, radio batteries, etc. at the drop points. On an incident map, the symbol for a drop point is a filled dot with the letters D-# next to them with the # designating which number is it.|$|R
50|$|The {{material}} {{of choice is}} the bark from Stringybark (Eucalyptus tetradonta). The bark must be free of knots and other blemishes. It is best cut from the tree in the wet season when the sap is rising. Two horizontal slices and a single vertical slice are made into the tree, and the bark is carefully peeled off {{with the aid of}} a <b>sharpened</b> <b>tool.</b> Only the inner smooth bark is kept and placed in a fire. After heating in the fire, the bark is flattened under foot and weighted with stones or logs to dry flat. Once dry, it is ready to paint upon.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the bond}} and grade of the {{grinding}} wheel, {{it may be}} used for <b>sharpening</b> cutting <b>tools</b> such as tool bits, drill bits, chisels, and gouges. Alternatively, it may be used to roughly shape metal prior to welding or fitting.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Social {{networking}} makes {{digital communication}} technologies <b>sharpening</b> <b>tools</b> for extending the social circle of people. Privacy preservation {{is a significant}} research issue in social networking. Here user Profile matching with privacy preservation in mobile social networks (MSNs) is studied and a family of Profile matching protocols is introduced. An explicit Comparison-based Profile matching protocol (eCPM) which runs between two parties, an initiator and a responder is proposed which enables the initiator to obtain the comparison-based matching result about a specified attribute in their Profiles, while preventing their attribute values from disclosure. An implicit Comparison-based Profile matching protocol (iCPM) is then proposed which allows the initiator to directly obtain some messages instead of the comparison result fro...|$|R

40|$|Abortion {{pertains}} to the expulsion or removal of the embryo or fetus from the uterus thus, annihilating the pregnancy before it is suitable. It can either be induced on purpose, or happen spontaneously, and the condition is generally known as a miscarriage. These terms usually refers to the abortion of a human pregnancy. The process of abortion may be carried in safe or unsafe manners (Sedgh, et. al., 2012). The concept of induced abortion is made possible by numerous processes which also include the utilization of <b>sharpened</b> <b>tools,</b> herbal abortifacients, the usage of physical trauma, and other conventional procedures. The modern medicine uses the surgical and medications methods to perform abortion to the human pregnancy. There may be the substantial variations in the prevalence, legality, religious and cultural status of abortion across the globe...|$|R
50|$|Repairs often mean simple {{replacement}} of worn or used components {{intended to be}} periodically renewed by a home-owner, such as burnt out light bulbs, worn out batteries, or overfilled vacuum cleaner bags. Another class of home repairs relates to restoring something to a useful condition, such as <b>sharpening</b> <b>tools</b> or utensils, replacing leaky faucet washers, cleaning out plumbing traps, rain gutters. Because of the required precision, specialized tools, or hazards, {{some of these are}} best left to experts such as a plumber. One emergency repair that may be necessary in this area is overflowing toilets. Most of them have a shut-off valve on a pipe beneath or behind them so that the water supply can be turned off while repairs are made, either by removing a clog or repairing a broken mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Savage {{was born}} in Southampton, England, on August 16, 1832 to John and Ann, {{the first of four}} children. At the age of four, his {{clothing}} caught on fire from a stray burning woodchip, and he suffered bad burns. Rather than attend school, he peddled salt in Southampton and helped a coachmaker <b>sharpen</b> <b>tools.</b> On May 25, 1848 at age 15, he was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), to his parents' disapproval. Savage moved to the Isle of Wight to work as a fishmonger and helped the Mormons there to proselyte. He returned to Southampton and worked for William Eddington in a stationary shop from 1851 to 1852. Eddington also educated Savage; Savage writes that Eddington [...] "placed me as it were on the road to fame." ...|$|R
50|$|The menhir {{has been}} under {{examination}} since August 2004. Archaeologists {{have been able to}} find where the stone was originally placed. It was discovered that the menhir laid where the South-Western piece of rock was found. In fact, part of that stone was still stuck in the ground. It was also discovered that there was another element that could be part of the menhir: a ring made of rocks which surrounded the main stone. It has been also considered that this ring could be part of the archaeological remains of a human settlement. Besides, there were many other objects such as silex tools that could be related to a human settlement. Archaeologists also found remains that showed humans had been there: <b>sharpening</b> <b>tools</b> and stone hammers (that were probably used {{in the construction of the}} menhir).|$|R

2500|$|Sharpening a graver or burin {{requires}} {{either a}} sharpening stone or wheel. Harder carbide and steel gravers require diamond-grade sharpening wheels; these gravers can be polished to a mirror finish using a ceramic or cast iron lap, which {{is essential in}} creating bright cuts. Several low-speed, reversible sharpening system made specifically for hand engravers are available that reduce sharpening time. Fixtures that secure the tool in place at certain angles and geometries are also available to take the guesswork from sharpening to produce accurate points. Very few master engravers exist today who rely solely on [...] "feel" [...] and muscle memory to <b>sharpen</b> <b>tools.</b> These master engravers typically worked for many years as an apprentice, most often learning techniques decades before modern machinery was available for hand engravers. These engravers typically trained in such countries as Italy and Belgium, where hand engraving has a rich and long heritage of masters.|$|R
