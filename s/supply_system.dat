Currently, centralized hot water <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> are in an emergency condition {{due to the fact}} that the external networks are made of black pipes without anticorrosive coatings. A fundamental difference between hot water <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> and heating systems is the nature of black metal corrosion. The purpose of this article is to conduct a research of the state of hot water <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> and consider options for their recovery. The options suggested for restoration of hot water <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> in cities and settlements of Ukraine are the following: complete replacement of failed networks with new pre-insulated plastic pipelines; refusal from external networks of centralized hot water <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> and a central heat point with the installation of individual heat points in each house; decentralization of hot water <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> by installing electric water heaters. A technical and economic comparison of these options is carried out, and the advantages and disadvantages of each option are considered. The arrangement of a set of individual heat points instead of one central point cannot be considered as the recommended method, because of the need for large additional costs for the reconstruction of heating, water supply and electricity <b>supply</b> <b>systems.</b> The most technically and economically justified method from the considered renovation methods of hot water <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> is the complete replacement of failed steel pipelines with new nonmetallic pre-insulated structures...|$|R

40|$|Every society {{faces the}} task of {{providing}} its people with basic goods such as water, food or energy. Meeting basic needs and ensuring quality of life, while not deteriorating ecological conditions, provide the normative framework for structures of provision. Therefore, societies have developed specific structures and forms of regulation. Within Social Ecology these structures are conceptual-ised as <b>supply</b> <b>systems,</b> emphasizing dynamic relation patterns between natural and societal spheres. <b>Supply</b> <b>systems</b> cover material and energy dimensions as well as cultural-symbolic aspects; within <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> “the social ” and “the natural ” interact and develop specific problem dynamics in which economic, technical, political and ecological problems are closely linked.

5|$|Many birds show plumage {{patterns}} in ultraviolet that are {{invisible to the}} human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar {{to the naked eye}} are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. With the exception of pigeons and a few other species, the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds.

5|$|Most of the {{reactors}} {{were shut down}} between 1964 and 1971, with an average individual life span of 22 years. The last reactor, N Reactor, continued to operate as a dual-purpose reactor, being both a power reactor used to feed the civilian electrical grid via the Washington Public Power <b>Supply</b> <b>System</b> (WPPSS) and a plutonium production reactor for nuclear weapons. N Reactor operated until 1987. Since then, most of the Hanford reactors have been entombed ("cocooned") to allow the radioactive materials to decay, and the surrounding structures have been removed and buried. The B-Reactor has not been cocooned and is accessible to the public on occasional guided tours.

The system was intended to eliminate grain speculation, to create a standard price and to increase government revenue.
