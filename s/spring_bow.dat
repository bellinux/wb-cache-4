Hanau <b>spring</b> <b>bow</b> is claimed to {{maintain}} self centering property when it is positioned in the patient {{as well as in}} the articulator. However there is no documented evidence to prove that feature. Mainly it was due to the absence of a testing device.

40|$|This work {{describes}} deformation {{and crack}} formation in sawn timber of pine and spruce after first drying and subsequent cycles of resoaking {{in water and}} drying. The influence of annual ring orientation and the occurrence of juvenile wood was determined. In addition, the influence of compression wood, annual ring orientation {{at the edges of}} the cross section, the position of the board surface in relation to the pith, and the condition of the board surface i. e. whether wet or dry during resoaking were studied. When timber is exposed to repeated cycles of wetting and drying, warp, viz <b>spring,</b> <b>bow,</b> twist and cup, increases and is greater after the first cycle. The influence of annual ring orientation on <b>spring,</b> <b>bow</b> and twist depends on the type of deformation and on the kind of wood. Generally, the results indicated that timber with vertical and semi (half) vertical annual rings show less deformation (mean values) than plain sawn timber and timber containing pith. Cup is mainly caused by transverse anisotropy and is strongly influenced by the radius of the annual ring. Therefore, timber with vertical annual rings do not show any cup. Spring, twist and, especially bow are strongly influenced by compression wood. Large amount of compression wood in sawn timber increases such deformation. The distance between sawn timber in the log and the pith with surrounding juvenile wood is of vital significance for cracking. During moisture cycling, the amount of boards that develop cracks increased irrespective of their prior location in the cross section of the stem. Timber sawn from near the pith or distinctly containing pith has a higher relative crack length compared to timber sawn away from and lacking pith. In timber exposed to repeated cycles of wetting and drying the crack length increases irrespective of its prior location in the stem...|$|E
40|$|Background: Customer {{satisfaction}} {{plays an}} important role in the success and continuity of a business. Dental Laboratory of RSGM Faculty of Dental Medicine Universitas Airlangga provides services for Faculty of Dental Medicine, Universitas Airlangga students enrolled in a dental profession program. One of services offered is making of removable orthodontic appliances. Until now there has been no research on customer satisfaction after the appliances made in the laboratory. Purpose: This study was conducted to determine whether Universitas Airlangga dental students as customers were satisfied with the work of the RSGM Dental laboratory, particularly in orthodontics. Method: An analytic observational study was carried out on 48 Faculty of Dental Medicine Universitas Airlangga students who were enrolled in a dental profession program and made removable orthodontic appliances in RSGM Dental Laboratory. The students were asked to fill out a questionnaire about satisfaction regarding the timeliness, the suitability of results, the services provided, the quality of both active and passive components, the ease of insertion and activation. Data were analyzed descriptively. The relationship between satisfaction towards the quality of clasp, <b>spring,</b> <b>bow</b> and satisfaction towards the quality of acrylic plate to the ease of insertion were analyzed with Fischer exact test. The relationship between satisfaction towards the quality of clasp, <b>spring,</b> <b>bow</b> and satisfaction towards the quality of acrylic plate to the ease of activation were analyzed by chi square. Result: Respondents who were satisfied with the timeliness of work were 54. 17 %, the suitability of the results of the query were 79. 17 %, the services provided were 95. 83 %, the results of clasp, bow and spring were 72. 92 %, the results of acrylic plate were 77. 08 %, the ease of insertion were 54. 17 %, and the ease of activation were 89. 58 %. The results of the statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between the ease of insertion and the quality of clasp, spring and bow (p = 0. 01) as well as acrylic plate made (p = 0. 045 0. 05)). Conclusion: It was concluded that the majority of respondents are satisfied with the results of removable orthodontic appliances produced, but punctuality still needs to be improved...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the correlation between}} sagittal condylar guidance obtained by protrusive interocclusal records and panoramic radiograph tracing methods in human dentulous subjects. Materials and Methods: The sagittal condylar guidance was determined in 75 dentulous subjects by protrusive interocclusal records using Aluwax through a face bow transfer (HANAU™ <b>Spring</b> <b>Bow,</b> Whip Mix Corporation, USA) to a semi-adjustable articulator (HANAU™ Wide-Vue Articulator, Whip Mix Corporation, USA). In the same subjects, the sagittal outline of the articular eminence and glenoid fossa was traced in panoramic radiographs. The sagittal condylar path inclination was constructed by joining the heights of curvature in the glenoid fossa and the corresponding articular eminence. This was then related to the constructed Frankfurt′s horizontal plane to determine the radiographic angle of sagittal condylar guidance. Results: A strong positive correlation existed between right and left condylar guidance by the protrusive interocclusal method (P 0. 000) and similarly by the radiographic method (P 0. 013). The mean difference between the condylar guidance obtained using both methods were 1. 97 ° for the right side and 3. 18 ° for the left side. This difference between the values by the two methods {{was found to be}} highly significant for the right (P 0. 003) and left side (P 0. 000), respectively. The sagittal condylar guidance obtained from both methods showed a significant positive correlation on right (P 0. 000) and left side (P 0. 015), respectively. Conclusion: Panoramic radiographic tracings of the sagittal condylar path guidance may be made relative to the Frankfurt′s horizontal reference plane and the resulting condylar guidance angles used to set the condylar guide settings of semi-adjustable articulators...|$|E

50|$|Joubert and White {{began the}} {{manufacture}} of high-grade buckboards in Glens Falls in 1865. They were the innovators and inventors of a famous model that was known for its suspension system and was sought by many wealthy people here and abroad. Notable owners of the buckboard included Cornelius Vanderbilt, John Jacob Astor, J. Pierpont Morgan, Louis Tiffany, Spencer Trask, Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. A standard buckboard was constructed by running two planks of wood between {{the front and rear}} axles and mounting the passenger seat body on the planks. The only shock absorption was in the flexibility of the planks. When riding on the rough roads of their day, passengers felt like they were riding a bucking horse, hence the name. Joubert devised a way to attach two steel leaf <b>springs,</b> <b>bowed</b> upwards to the planks, with the passenger seat attached {{to the top of the}} springs. The seats moved vertically on the springs and also rocked forward and back, making for a more cushioned ride. In 1880, Joubert patented his suspension design in 1880. Some 50 carriage and sleigh models by Joubert and White were considered to be of superior quality. A good buggy would sell for $50 to $75, while the Joubert and White buckboard might cost $500 to $800 with some as high as $1000 or more if customized.|$|R

A revised collector was in use within the first few years, by 1900.

40|$|In {{compliance}} with European Regulation and with particular reference to EN 14081, grade assignment of timber {{is based upon}} observation of three properties: strength, stiffness and density. Timber is hereby segregated into different grades. However, characteristic values are statistical properties: strength and density are described by 5 % percentile values and stiffness by the mean value. In other words, even though every piece is assigned to a single grade, the properties can only be determined for the overall population of observations and not for every single piece of timber. ViSCAN, with it’s built in laser interferometer, measures the frequency of vibration. X-ray scanning is used to compute density on cross (DENSCAN) and longitudinal (GoldenEye) transport.

Since moisture content influences wood properties an in-line moisture meter (M 3 SCAN) optionally can be installed so to adjust the measured properties to reference conditions.

This will give him a starting point to compare his later freepoint readings to. The tool is then run roughly 500 feet past the estimated stuck point. Stretch and torque are applied, and readings are taken. If the tool indicates that the pipe is stuck at that point the tool is pulled uphole and readings are taken again. By applying the bracketing technique, the pipe recovery engineer is quickly able to identify the exact point that the pipe is free.|$|R

40|$|Latent class {{regression}} is {{a statistical}} method {{which is not}} well known in wood science for predicting distortion of sawn timber from structural wood characteristics. The method identifies unknown subgroups in a dataset and allows more accurate regression models to be derived. We identified two separate classes to describe the relationship between bowdry, springdry, or twistdry and the predictors: initial distortion bowfresh, springfresh, or twistfresh, wood density, ring width, ring orientation, wood type (juvenile or adult), percentage compression wood measured separately on the four faces, and the contagion index which is a measure for the distribution of compression wood. The latent class regression models developed for the separate classes explained the variation in <b>bow,</b> <b>spring,</b> and twist to a higher degree than a single regression model over the entire dataset. For bow, R 2 increased from 0. 13 to 0. 24 and 0. 41 for Class 1 and Class 2, for spring from 0. 24 to 0. 45 and 0. 67, and for twist from 0. 15 to 0. 38 and 0. 33.
