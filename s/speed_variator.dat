40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a control and {{regulation}} method of input DC voltages of five-level Neutral Point Clamping (NPC) Active Power Filter (APF). This APF is applied for the enhancement of medium voltage network power quality by compensation of harmonic currents produced by an induction motor <b>speed</b> <b>variator.</b> In the first part, the authors present a topology of five-level NPC Voltage Source Inverter (VSI), and its simplified Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) control strategy. In the second part, the control strategy of Three-level PWM current rectifier is presented. In the third part, to remedy to instability problem of the input DC voltages of the APF, the authors propose the feedback control of the three-level rectifier associate with a simplified SVPWM with redundant vectors method of five-level APF. After that, the sliding mode regulator used to control the APF is developed. The application of the proposed control algorithm offers the possibility of stabilizing the DC voltages of APF. Stable DC bus supply associated with sliding regulator of APF allows getting low-harmonic content network currents with unity power factor. In all over, the instability problem associated with use of multilevel APF is solved. The obtained results are full of promise to use the multilevel APF in medium voltage and great power application...|$|E

40|$|A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) of split-power design consists of a variator and an arrangement of planetary gears. A black box model describing such transmissions is presented. The model {{can be used for}} synthesis as well as loss-free analysis of split-power CVT concepts in general. The planetary gear arrangement may have an arbitrary number of shafts. It is described by a sufficient number of basic speed ratios. By using several modes, both a large overall speed ratio range and low variator power ratios can be obtained. This is necessary for optimal engine use and high transmission efficiency. In each mode, specific components are active in the transmission. The black box model includes two modes, but CVT concepts with an arbitrary number of modes can be described by combining matching two-mode CVTs. General conditions for performing mode shifts are presented. A general relationship between overall <b>speed</b> ratio and <b>variator</b> <b>speed</b> ratio has been derived, as well as a general relationship for variator power ratios of loss-free transmissions. Different variator types are categorized by their ratio coverage. Possible combinations of variator power ratio, overall ratio coverage and variator ratio coverage are mapped and presented graphically for different configurations. Suitable combinations of these quantities can be chosen. Design parameters included will then indicate how the CVT should be designed. On the basis of the black box model, two split-power CVT concepts for automotive use are proposed. Each of the transmissions, having a geared neutral, is an infinitely variable transmission (IVT). They do not need such devices as starting clutches or hydrodynamic torque converters. They are designed for use in front wheel drive cars with transversely mounted engines. The main components of the first IVT are a traction ball drive variator, a simple epicyclic gear train with three shafts and some gear stages. The transmission can be run in three modes, including a separate mode for reverse. The second IVT consists of a hydrostatic variator, two simple epicyclic gear trains with three shafts and a few gear stages. It can be run in two modes. Reverse drive is included in one of the modes. Losses in gear meshes and variators are estimated. Hereby, constant component efficiencies are used, as well as efficiencies calculated taking load and speed dependence of the losses into consideration...|$|R
