50|$|It {{was until}} the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens that Zou Shiming claimed China's first boxing medal. He {{eventually}} {{made it into}} the semifinals and won a bronze. This achievement was greeted with rapturous applause and Chinese reporters nicknamed him the Dark Horse at first because of his underdog status. Later, they tried the Knight of Lightning or the Fox or, sometimes, the Pirate, all celebrating his knack for <b>snatching</b> <b>points</b> and peeling away from his opponents' reach. That strategy was helping him win international matches. In Athens, Zou made it to the semifinals, eventually winning a bronze, China’s first in boxing. It was another year before Zou won his first gold medal, at the 2005 World Amateur Boxing Championships, held in the western Chinese city of Mianyang. He was the nation's first amateur boxing champion, and China celebrated.|$|R

Eric Boocock was now a regular in the England team, and missed a number of Halifax matches due to fixture clashes, and with Younghusband also out {{for a couple of weeks}} through illness during July the promotion was kept busy making sure that the Dukes had effective sides out. They were almost undone at the end of July when the Ivan Mauger led Newcastle Diamonds arrived at the Shay and left on the back of a very close 38-40 defeat. Fortunately Eric Boocock was back for this one and scored an impressive 15 point maximum as the Dukes used rider replacement for the missing Younghusband. This included the only defeat of Ivan Mauger all night and an impressive last heat win to <b>snatch</b> the <b>points</b> for the Dukes when he came from the back to beat young Danish newcomer Ole Olsen and experienced Dave Gifford.

The Anglo Celt reports that both teams played with resolute determination in a tough exciting match, the final score being 2-4 to 0-7. Munterconnaught the more balanced outfit settled quickly.

Paris Saint-Germain coach Antoine Kombouaré made a winning return to former club Valenciennes as his side took all three points. Paris Saint-Germain kept themselves up with Ligue 1's leading pack with a home win over struggling Lille. In a frenetic final ten minutes that saw two goals and the expulsion of PSG's Stéphane Sessègnon, AS Monaco secured {{a dramatic}} win over the capital club at the Stade Louis II. Substitute Bafétimbi Gomis swooped to grab an equalizer five minutes from time as Olympique Lyonnais maintained their unbeaten start to the season with a draw at Paris Saint-Germain. Guillaume Hoarau found the net {{for the first time this}} season as Paris Saint-Germain picked up a point with a draw at Lorient. Paris Saint-Germain's bright start to the season is now a fading memory as Antoine Kombouaré's men stuttered to a third successive league draw as they were held by Nancy. Albin Ebondo's strike was enough for hosts Toulouse to edge out Paris Saint-Germain. Mevlüt Erdinç returned to former club Sochaux and scored PSG's third but also missed a first-half penalty as the capital club won for the first time since Week 4. A late goal on the counter-attack from Loïc Rémy allowed Nice to <b>snatch</b> three <b>points</b> from their trip to face Paris Saint-Germain.

The second half was, however, Chievo's, the majority of the action coming in Antonio Mirante's goalmouth, although chances were still at a premium. Chievo made their improved performance count through ex-Parma frontman Alberto Paloschi with 12 minutes to go and a draw looked the fair result, but a late Giovinco finish from substitute Jonathan Biabiany's inch-perfect whipped cross saw Parma <b>snatch</b> all three <b>points</b> and Giovinco become the first player since Adriano in 2003–04 to score 3 goals in the first two matches. Two-goal Giovinco was then sent off in injury time after he was shown a second yellow card for kicking the ball into the net following the referee's decision to penalise the diminutive Italian.

25|$|September: Aldershot {{continued}} their early unbeaten {{run with a}} third consecutive 1–1 draw at home to Northampton, though the Shots needed a Ben Harding volley in the 5th minute of injury time to salvage a point. The next game - away to promotion-chasing Port Vale - promised {{to be a tough}} test, and this was proved right as the club suffered its first loss of the season, Gary Roberts scoring the only goal of the game. On 16 September the management brought in winger Marlon Jackson on loan from Bristol City, a player who assistant manager Gary Owers believed would help the team in the attacking third. Wycombe were the next visitors to the Recreation Ground, which meant a return for former Shots' boss Gary Waddock, who led the club to the Football Conference championship in the 2007–08 season. The match {{failed to live up to}} expectations, ending in a dull goalless draw. This fifth low-scoring draw of the season encouraged fears that the side were not good enough up front, and were not converting the few chances being presented to them. The squad responded by taking a 2–0 lead away to Stockport in their next game, only to throw it away in the final minutes to draw yet again.

In injury time, Gary Neville connected with a floating corner provided by Beckham, only for it to ricochet off the crossbar. Although they gained a point, United increased their lead due to their contenders' inability to close the gap. They typically left it late to <b>snatch</b> the three <b>points</b> in their next match – away to Aston Villa – but followed it up against Derby County with a somewhat polished 2–0 victory. The only drawback {{that came out of}} the match was a hamstring injury suffered by Giggs that ruled him out of the FA Cup replay away to Barnsley and remained serious doubt for first leg of the Champions League quarter-final at Monaco. Giggs joined Scholes and Keane on the injury list, who both had knee injuries. Another early morning kick-off had meant United had the chance to open up an 11-point lead at the top of the table if they could beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. They did via a rare goal from Phil Neville, which also ended the Blues' title challenge. Although Arsenal had three games in hand, a third successive title was within United's grasp.|$|R
5000|$|... 2016-2017A new season, a new coach. After {{failing to}} reach a deal with Juanjo Cháfer, the club {{acquired}} the services of renowned coach Antonio Villaescusa who arrived in June 2016 having previously coached at CD Benidorm, CF La Nucia, CD Polop and at rivals CD Dénia. Several new arrivals replaced departures, the most controversial {{of which was the}} departure of former skipper Javi Hernandez to CD Dénia, both parties having failed to come to a mutual agreement for the long-standing attacking midfielder to remain at Jávea. In came former Real Madrid academy player Petu from Orihuela CF, defensive midfielder Gervasio from CD Dénia, midfielder Jaime agulló from CD Benidorm, midfielder David Cardona returning to the club from CD Dénia and Eduardo Samblas from UD Portuarios. Pre-season was hardly inspiring, five draws and a single win against UD Levante Juvenil and the side started the season in similar fashion, drawing four and losing twice in the oprning six games to sit precariously in 16th spot. And then something clicked and Jávea went on a run of 11 games with just one defeat including four wins on the trot to climb to fifth spot and in with a shout of the play-offs. A stumble in February of just two wins in five saw the top three slide steadily away into the distance and the emphasis, for the fans at least, seemed to change to finishing as the top Marina Alta side in the group. And that meant defeating CD Dénia in the penultimate game of the season. In March the side picked up three decent wins, including a strong 2-0 win against play-off contenders UD Gandia but a run of three games without a victory at the end of April and beginning of May, including a 1-0 defeat at rivals CD Dénia, saw any slim hope of a play-off spot gone. On {{the final day of the}} season, a close game against UE CF Tavernes saw Jávea come out top with a late goal to <b>snatch</b> all three <b>points</b> and finish in 6th position.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} year, Colter {{teamed up}} with John Potts, another {{former member of the}} Lewis and Clark Expedition, once again in the region near Three Forks, Montana. In 1808, Colter and Potts set out from Fort Raymond once more to negotiate trade agreements with local nations. While leading a group of eight hundred Flathead and Crow Indians back to the trading fort, Colter's party was attacked by a mass of Blackfeet numbering over fifteen-hundred. The Flatheads and Crows managed to force the Blackfeet into retreat, but Colter suffered a leg wound from either a bullet or arrow. This wound was non-serious as Colter quickly recuperated and left Fort Raymond with Potts once more the following year. In 1809, another altercation with the Blackfeet resulted in John Potts' death and Colter's capture. While going by canoe up the Jefferson River, Potts and Colter encountered several hundred Blackfeet who demanded they come ashore. Colter went ashore and was disarmed and stripped naked. When Potts then refused to come ashore he was shot and wounded. Potts in his turn shot one of the Indian warriors and died riddled with bullets fired by the Indians on the shore. His body was brought ashore and hacked to pieces. After a council, Colter was motioned, told in Crow to leave, and encouraged to run. It soon became apparent that he was running for his life pursued by a large pack of young braves. A fast runner, after several miles the still-naked Colter was exhausted and bleeding from his nose but far ahead of most of the group with only one assailant still close to him. He then managed to overcome the lone man: Again he turned his head, and saw the savage not twenty yards from him. Determined if possible to avoid the expected blow, he suddenly stopped, turned round, and spread out his arms. The Indian, surprised by the suddenness of the action, and perhaps at the bloody appearance of Colter, also attempted to stop; but exhausted with running, he fell whilst endeavouring to throw his spear, which stuck in the ground, and broke in his hand. Colter instantly <b>snatched</b> up the <b>pointed</b> part, with which he pinned him to the earth, and then continued his flight. John Bradbury, 1817.|$|R
