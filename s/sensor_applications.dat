25|$|PMMA transmits up to 92% {{of visible}} light (3mm thickness), {{and gives a}} {{reflection}} of about 4% from each of its surfaces due to its refractive index (1.4905 at 589.3nm). It filters ultraviolet (UV) light at wavelengths below about 300 nm (similar to ordinary window glass). Some manufacturers add coatings or additives to PMMA to improve absorption in the 300–400nm range. PMMA passes infrared light of up to 2,800nm and blocks IR of longer wavelengths up to 25,000nm. Colored PMMA varieties allow specific IR wavelengths to pass while blocking visible light (for remote control or heat <b>sensor</b> <b>applications,</b> for example).|$|E
