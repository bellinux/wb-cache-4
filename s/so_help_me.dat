500|$|Having {{initially}} {{announced a}} new album entitled <b>So</b> <b>Help</b> <b>Me</b> God slated for a 2014 release, in March 2015 West announced that the album would instead be tentatively called SWISH. Later that month, West was awarded an honorary doctorate by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for his contributions to music, fashion, and popular culture, officially making him an honorary DFA. The next month, West headlined at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK, despite a petition signed by almost 135,000 people against his appearance. Toward {{the end of the}} set, West proclaimed himself: [...] "the greatest living rock star on the planet." [...] Media outlets, including social media sites such as Twitter, were divided on his performance. NME stated, [...] "The decision to book West for the slot has proved controversial since its announcement, and the show itself appeared to polarise both Glastonbury goers and those who tuned in to watch on their TVs." [...] The publication added that [...] "he's letting his music speak for and prove itself." [...] The Guardian said that [...] "his set has a potent ferocity â€“ but there are gaps and stutters, and he cuts a strangely lone figure in front of the vast crowd." [...] In September 2015, West performed 808s & Heartbreak in its entirety two nights in a row to rave reviews at Hollywood Bowl. The performance featured a 60-person orchestra, a live band, guests from the album and 70 plus dancers. In December 2015, West released a song titled [...] "Facts".|$|E

2500|$|The {{opinions}} I {{have advanced}} ... are {{the effect of}} the most clear and long-established conviction that the Bible and the Testament are impositions upon the world, that the fall of man, the account of Jesus Christ being the Son of God, and of his dying to appease the wrath of God, and of salvation, by that strange means, are all fabulous inventions, dishonorable to the wisdom and power of the Almighty; that the only true religion is Deism, by which I then meant, and mean now, the belief of one God, and an imitation of his moral character, or the practice of what are called moral virtuesand that it was upon this only (so far as religion is concerned) that I rested all my hopes of happiness hereafter.

2500|$|On 18 April, the {{cardinals}} assembled in St. Peter's Basilica {{in the morning}} to concelebrate the mass Pro Eligendo Romano Pontifice (For the Election of the Roman Pontiff).
