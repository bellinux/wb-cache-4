40|$|Abstract. The {{debate over}} {{symbolic}} versus <b>sub-symbolic</b> representations of human cognition has been continuing for thirty years, with little {{indication of a}} resolution. The argument is this: Does the human cognitive system use symbols as a representation of knowledge, and does it process symbols and their respective constituents? Or does the human cognitive system use a distributed representation of knowledge, and is it somehow capable of processing this distributed representation of knowledge in a complex and meaningful way? This paper argues for an integrated symbolic and <b>sub-symbolic</b> approach to the representation of cognition. The lines of reasoning used as evidence to bolster this argument for an integrated approach are the cognitive architecture the Adaptive Character of Thought-Rational (ACT-R), and biology, where {{it is argued that}} symbolic and <b>sub-symbolic</b> representations of cognition are part of an intellectual continuum, with <b>sub-symbolic</b> representations at the low end and symbolic representations at the higher end...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} way of {{bridging}} the gap between symbolic and <b>sub-symbolic</b> reasoning.

The system has a fixed set of needs and its sole goal is to stay alive {{as long as possible}} by satisfying those needs. It operates without pre-programmed knowledge of any kind. The learning mechanism consists of several meta-rules that govern the development of its network-based memory structure. The decision making mechanism operates under time constraints and combines symbolic reasoning, aimed at compressing information, with <b>sub-symbolic</b> reasoning, aimed at planning...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to build an integrated environment to serve as an assistant in the educational process. Getting useful information for the teaching process is very difficult when we deal with unstructured knowledge. Neural networks can store <b>sub-symbolic</b> knowledge, but until recently it was believed to be only in a &quot;black- box &quot; format. Knowledge extraction from NNs is a relatively new field, which tries to reduce these disadvantages and build a bridge between <b>sub-symbolic</b> and symbolic knowledge. As the teaching process requires only symbolic knowledge, we believe this to be a chance for teachers to significantly improve their teaching materials and/or style by combining the symbolic knowledge of the domain theory with the rules extracted from the empirical <b>sub-symbolic</b> knowledge stored in NNs trained on examples. Therefore, we developed a Neural Network's <b>Sub-Symbolic</b> Knowledge Extraction Environment for the Teaching Process Assistance and also built a study case of teaching stock exchange developments...|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{extension}} of the heterogeneous multi-context reasoning framework by G. Brewka and T.

40|$|Hydroinformatics {{proceeds}} {{into that}} which M. B. Abbott has characterised as the 'post-symbolic' era along two différent paths. Along the one path, it élaborâtes tools {{and even more}} gênerai working environments for engineers, environmentalists and other Professionals that make little or no use of symbols in any conventional sensé, but which instead work almost entirely with signs. Along the other path, as illustrated in this présent work, hydroinformatics increasingly uses non-symbolic, and indeed strictly <b>sub-symbolic,</b> methods in order to construct thèse tools and more gênerai working environments. Of course, in this latter case, the constructor of thèse instruments must still make recourse to symbolic représentations, but, as explained here, thèse are employed essentially as aids to the thinking processes of the constructor, and are not carried over or incorporated in any way into the opérations of the constructions themselves. It is this second path of <b>sub-symbolic</b> constructions that forms {{the subject of the}} présent work. The first chapter of this work is given over to an introduction to the <b>sub-symbolic</b> paradigm in gênerai and within the particular context of hydroinformatics. The three main current divisions within the <b>sub-symbolic</b> paradigm are those of artificial neural networks (ANNs), evolutionary algorithms and cellular automata. A detailed description of artificial neural networks and, in particular, feed-forward, multi-layer perceptrons, which constitute the <b>sub-symbolic</b> tool used throughout this work, is given in Chapter 2. A brief description of the other two <b>sub-symbolic</b> méthodologies is given in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4, ANNs are used to model the rainfall-runoff process using artificially-generated data, laboratory-experimental data and real, measured-catchment data to an exceptionally high degree of accuracy. The problem of extrapolation is described and a possible solution is posed for this problem. In Chapter 5, ANNs are applied to the problem of finding an accurate and stable solution of the pure advection équation. The resulting ANNs provide results that are at least as good as those obtained by more traditional numerical methods. Finally, in Chapter 6, ANNs are applied to the more gênerai problem of data mining as exemplified by rainfall-runoff modelling, sait intrusion and sédiment transportation. It is shown that the A N N outperforms more traditional, essentially manual, methods of data mining, and also provides significantly more accurate results than those obtained by another <b>sub-symbolic</b> paradigm, namely that of genetic programming...|$|E

Introduction <b>Sub-symbolic</b> Machine Learning (ML) has become a paradigm for the development of systems that tackle recognition or classification tasks by mimicking the adaptation and learning capabilities of living organisms. While the "knowledge" in symbolic systems is mainly represented through logical rules (e. g., in Expert Systems, Artificial Intelligence), in <b>sub-symbolic</b> systems the knowledge is implicit in the values of the system parameters. In <b>sub-symbolic</b> systems a strong emphasis is put on the selforganization properties: the system evolves toward a better f [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our latest}} efforts {{to extend the}} Symbolic and <b>Sub-symbolic</b> Robotics Intelligence Control System (SS-RICS).

We also discuss recent exercises at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) robotics test facility as well as the addition of Decision Field Theory (DFT) into the architecture. We conclude that the hybrid nature of SS-RICS allows for some improvements over traditional architectures by allowing for both <b>sub-symbolic</b> and symbolic problems to be addressed.

40|$|To {{achieve a}} full, {{theoretical}} {{understanding of a}} cognitive process, explanations of the process need to be provided at both symbolic (i. e., representational) and <b>sub-symbolic</b> levels of description. We argue that cognitive models implemented in vector-symbolic architectures (VSAs) intrinsically operate at both of levels and thus provide a needed bridge. We characterize the <b>sub-symbolic</b> level of VSAs {{in terms of a}} small set of linear algebra operations. We characterize the symbolic level of VSAs in terms of cognitive processes, in particular how information is represented, stored, and retrieved, and classify vector-symbolic cognitive models in the literature according to their implementation of these processes. On the basis of our analysis, we speculate on avenues for future research, and suggest means for theoretical unification of existent models...|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} short {{paper and a}} report (see [Neto et al. 98] and [Neto and Costa 99]) it was shown that {{programming}} languages can be translated efficiently on recurrent (analog, rational weighted) neural nets, using bounded resources. This fact was achieved by creating a neural programming language called NETDEF, such that each program corresponds to a modular neural net that computes it. This framework has some practical implications in recent efforts to merge symbolic and subsymbolic computation. Adding neuron-synapse connections (high-order neurons) to the neural network model allows us to integrate learning into the NETDEF computing paradigm. Some possible enhancements are presented using this framework, namely structure selfmodification, and integration of <b>sub-symbolic</b> learning into the NETDEF neuron architecture.

40|$|Knowledge {{representation}} and reasoning methods in artificial intelligence almost exclusively rely on symbol-oriented methods: Statements describing aspects and objects {{of the system}} to be modeled are represented through symbols (mostly text strings), and these symbols are stored in a computer, and manipulated according to the inference rules prescribed by the reasoning method. This works reasonably well in situations where knowledge is available in explicit form, typically through experts or written documents. In situations where knowledge is only available implicitly, e. g. in large data sets, other methods, often based on statistical approaches, have been used more successfully. Many of these methods are based on neural network techniques, which typically represent and process knowledge at a level below symbols; this {{is often referred to}} as <b>sub-symbolic</b> representation.

Our system design is inspired by the cognitive process of a human musician.
