40|$|Despite {{complete}} resection, disease-free survival (DFS) {{of patients}} with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is less than 65 % after one year and not more than 35 % after three years. For muscle invasive gallbladder carcinoma (GBCA), prognosis is even worse, with an overall survival (OS) of only 30 % after three years. Thus, evaluation of adjuvant chemotherapy in biliary tract cancer in a large randomized trial is warranted. ACTICCA- 1 is a randomized, multidisciplinary, multinational phase III investigator initiated trial. With respect to data obtained in the ABC- 02 trial, we selected the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin for 24 weeks as investigational treatment. Based on adjuvant trials in pancreatic cancer with comparable postoperative recovery time, inclusion {{of patients with}}in a maximum interval of 16 weeks between surgery and start of chemotherapy was <b>stipulated.</b> <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> the different prognosis and treatment susceptibility of muscle invasive carcinoma, two separate cohorts (CCA and GBCA) were included to capture the potentially different treatment effects. Randomization is stratified for lymph node status for both cohorts and localization for CCA. The primary endpoint is DFS and secondary endpoints include OS, safety and tolerability of chemotherapy, quality of life, and patterns of disease recurrence. For CCA, adjuvant chemotherapy should increase DFS 24 months post-surgery from 40 to 55 % to be considered relevant. With a power of 80 % and a significance level of 5 %, 271 evaluable study patients have to be followed for 24 - 28 months to observe 166 events. For GBCA, chemotherapy should increase DFS 24 months post-surgery from 35 to 55 % to be of relevance; thus, 154 evaluable study patients have to be monitored for 24 - 28 months to observe 90 events. In both cohorts, randomization will be 1 : 1 with chemotherapy for 24 weeks and imaging every twelve weeks.

He was a {{particular}} favourite and protégé of the then-Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, Foulques de Villaret (1305-1319), who promoted him steadily to higher offices. Thus in 1307, Villaret made Albert the Order's preceptor in Cyprus, and allowed Albert to pay only half the <b>stipulated</b> annual <b>dues</b> ("responsions") <b>to</b> the Order.

In this article, the myth {{and narrative}} are analyzed as the features of human psycholinguistic structures, aiding the creation of variety of meanings that affects the everyday mass consciousness. Modern myths differ from the classical ones, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their genesis and clear pragmatics, framed for a particular social group. This unites modern mythology with the ideology.

Therefore, the article presents the process of narrative’s genesis from the myth; the common and distinctive features of myth and narrative are compared. They have such common features as metaphoricity, symbolism, imagery. Myth and narrative are based on the metaphorical theory of truth. Instead of searching the truth, their main function becomes the creation of meanings through the interpretation and representation. The differences between the classical myth and narrative are also analyzed in the article (tabulated), which are <b>stipulated</b> mainly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the different time perception - cyclic for a myth and linear for narrative.

Mutual illustrations can be initiate in climate and image data sets, sensor data sets, and medical data sets. The partiality in these data sets may stand up from a number of issues: In some circumstances, it may merely be a replication of definite measurements not being obtainable at the time, in others, the data may be absent <b>due</b> <b>to</b> incomplete system failure, or it may merely be a consequence of users being reluctant <b>to</b> <b>stipulate</b> attributes <b>due</b> <b>to</b> confidentiality worries. When a important portion of the entries are lost in all of the attributes, it turn into very tough to perform any generous of sensible extrapolation on the unique data. For such circumstances, we present the innovative idea of theoretical restoration in which we make effective theoretical representations on which the data mining algorithms can be openly smeared. The desirability behind the idea of theoretical restoration is to practice the correlation structure of the data in directive to precise it in terms of ideas rather than the unique dimensions. As a outcome, the restoration procedure evaluates only those theoretical aspects of the data can be mined from the partial data set, rather than might faults formed by extrapolation.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} {{with a description of}} the detail design features of the A 71 project study. This aircraft is an airliner designed for operation off single 2000 ft long runways. The overall description of the design and its aerodynamic characteristics are contained in Part I of the report (Ref. 1). The detail design of the structure and systems is conventional in most respects. The need to provide a long stroke undercarriage for STOL operations incurred a large weight penalty and it is concluded that further work is necessary to establish acceptable requirements for this type of undercarriage. A separate investigation (Ref. 3) has shown that the aircraft does not meet its <b>stipulated</b> design objectives <b>due</b> <b>to</b> an inability to cope with engine failure and gusting cross wind conditions. A study to investigate the potential of the cross-coupling of adjacent powerplants to mitigate engine failure control problems suggests that the weight penalty is not justified (Ref. -) ...|$|R
40|$|The local {{government}} sphere {{is comprised of}} municipalities whose functions include the provision of consumer services. A substantial portion of municipal revenue, which is also used for service provision, is derived from rates and service charges. Through the billing process, the municipality <b>stipulates</b> the amount <b>due</b> <b>to</b> be paid by each account holder. In the case of rates and consumer tariffs, this usually occurs on a monthly basis. Towards the end of 2002, overdue rates and service charges in the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Municipality amounted to over R 800 million. In spite of various attempts undertaken by the municipality to collect overdue amounts, some residents are struggling to pay. Various reasons have been advanced for this scenario.

The study {{investigated}} {{perceptions of the}} School Management Teams (SMTs) and parents in the School Governing Bodies (SGBs) regarding the parents understanding of their roles. The South African Schools Act, 84 of 1996, provided all public schools with powers to run the schools through the SGBs. As an educator and the member of the SMT, I have observed that most governance roles are performed by the Principal and staff in the schools, hence conducted this study. The study was a multi-site case study of three primary schools of Ndwedwe circuit. To collect data the study used three instruments, namely interviews, observation and document analysis. The findings of the study revealed that parents in the School Governing Bodies are not coping with their many roles as they are <b>stipulated</b> by SASA <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their low levels of literacy. Besides illiteracy it seems parents in the SGBs lack information regarding their roles. The study recommends that parents in the SGBs must kept informed, trained and encouraged to upgrade their literacy levels to cope in their governance role...|$|R

40|$|In most of {{the cases}} caused by natural {{emergencies}} like earthquakes, flooding or tsunamis the public supply with electricity, drinking water and waste water breaks down. The public transportation system and the road-and path network will also collapse in a defined area. Especially in less developed countries, in which the public infrastructure is not build up that good anyway, this leads to a high health risk for the affected people because the access to safe drinking water is even more limited. This leads to the point that people drink water from unsafe origins like ponds and rivers. The German federal forces invented the so called common dosage plan to treat water from any contaminated water source (no salt water) to a safe, physical harmless drinking water. The system is based on different water treatment steps, namely flocculation, chlorination and activated carbon filtration. It is a large scale technical process and needs electrical power to run the pumps, stirrers, valves and controls. A group of scientist has adopted this large scale process and developed it to a currentless and simple to operate process, which can be used after natural catastrophes by the affected people. The author of this work was part of a drinking water helping team after the terrible Tsunami 2005. The team operated the drinking water supply for about 1000 refugees in a special tent camp. These experiences in the field work in Sri Lanka 2005 lead to the present work During the field work in Sri Lanka the so called sloping hose process was used. This process is based on the CDP and uses high amounts and concentrations of the treatment chemicals. Especially by the use of the chlorine tablets based on the waterfree disinfectant sodiumdichoroisocyanurate there were negative experiences during the field tests. In summary this was: - Rejection of the treated raw water by the affected people because of the high doses of water treatment the drinking water had a strong chemical smell and also a not common taste. This smell and taste was misinterpreted by the people because they thought the water could be toxic. - Production of high concentration of Trihalomethanes and other water soluble organic halogenated compounds <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the tablet additives of the used chlorine tables - The compounds sodium- and calciumhypochlorite belong to the dangerous goods <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the regulations of the international air transport association and therefore {{it is not possible to}} transport these compounds by air for a quick drinking water help action within the first three days after such a catastrophe. Therefore in this work, which was restricted to the investigation of <b>stipulated</b> German products <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the German emergency water legislation, namely the three compounds sodiumhypochlorite (NaOCl), calciumhypochlorite (Ca(OCl) 2) and sodiumdichloroicocyanurate (NaCl 2 (CNO) 3) as waterfree compound or as dihydrate were compared as the only in Germany permitted disinfectants by measuring their efficiency during the chlorination of so called “worst case water”. This water quality was defined by the highest German Technical Drinking Water Authority (DVGW) as the effluent of a municipal waste water plant with at least 300. 000 inhabitants and is the worst water quality, which could be used for the drinking water supply as raw water in emergencies. All experiments were carried out as simple batch experiments. Additional a special chlorine-producing anodic oxidation device (diamond electrode) was tested...|$|R
