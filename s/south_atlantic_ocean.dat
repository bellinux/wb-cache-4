5|$|Typically, {{tropical}} cyclones do {{not form}} in the <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> due to strong upper level shear, cool water temperatures, {{and the lack of}} a convergence zone of convection. Occasionally though, as seen in 1991 and early 2004, conditions can become slightly more favorable. For Catarina, {{it was a combination of}} climatic and atmospheric anomalies. Water temperatures on Catarina's path ranged from 24 to 25°C, slightly less than the 26.5°C temperature of a normal tropical cyclone, but sufficient for a storm of baroclinic origin.|$|E
5|$|Jamestown is {{the capital}} of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, located on the island of Saint Helena in the <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> It is also the {{historic}} main settlement of the island and is on its north-western coast. It is the island's only port and the centre of the island's road and communications network. It was founded when colonists from the English East India Company settled on the island in 1659 and was briefly occupied by the Dutch East India Company in 1673 before being recaptured. Many of the buildings built by the East India Company in the 1700s survive and give the town its distinctive Georgian flavour.|$|E
5|$|Bonita {{emerged into}} the Mozambique Channel as a {{significantly}} diminished storm, though it quickly regained {{some of its}} previous intensity. Three days after its initial landfall, the cyclone moved ashore over the Zambezia Province of Mozambique. Throughout northern parts of the country, Bonita triggered extensive flooding that damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings and reportedly killed 17 individuals. Swollen rivers submerged roads and bridges, isolating some locations. A meteorological rarity, Bonita continued inland for several days, persisting as a distinct tropical low; the system traversed southern Africa and ultimately entered the <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> In the process, it dropped unseasonably heavy rainfall over Zimbabwe and Zamibia. A paper published by the Zambia Meteorological Department asserted that Bonita was the first storm confirmed to have tracked across the African continent from the South-West Indian Ocean to the Southern Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Peracarid crustaceans, {{including}} isopods, {{are known}} to form {{a significant part of}} the macrobenthic community that is responsible for scavenging on large food falls onto the sea floor. In 2000, scientists of the Diversity of the deep Atlantic benthos (DIVA 1) expedition (cruise M48/1 of the German research vessel RV Meteor III) discovered and collected three new species of the Asellota suborder of benthic isopods from the abyssal plains of the Angola Basin in the <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> In 2003, De Broyer et al. collected some 68,000 peracarid crustaceans from 62 species from baited traps deployed in the Weddell Sea, Scotia Sea, and off the South Shetland Islands. They found that about 98% of the specimens belonged to the amphipod superfamily Lysianassoidea, and 2% to the isopod family Cirolanidae. Half of these species were collected from depths of greater than 1000meters.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of the Andes and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of the Andes, it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on Santonian-Campanian sediments of Ocean Drilling Program Sites 1257 (2951 mbsl) and 1259 (2353 mbsl) from Demerara Rise (Leg 207, western {{tropical}} Atlantic, off Surinam). According to its position, Demerara Rise should {{have been influenced by}} the early opening of the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway and the establishment of a bottom-water connection between the central and <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Oceans</b> during the Late Cretaceous. The investigated benthic foraminiferal faunas demonstrate strong fluctuations in bottom-water oxygenation and organic-matter flux to the sea-floor. The Santonian-earliest Campanian interval is characterised by laminated black shales without benthic foraminifera in the lowermost part, followed by an increasing number of benthic foraminifera. These are indicative of anoxic to dysoxic bottom waters, high organic-matter fluxes and a position within the oxygen minimum zone. At the shallower Site 1259, benthic foraminifera occurred earlier (Santonian) than at the deeper Site 1257 (Early Campanian). This suggests that the shallower site was characterised by fluctuations in the oxygen minimum zone and that a re-oxygenation of the sea-floor started considerably earlier at shallower water-depths. We speculate that this re-oxygenation was related to the ongoing opening of the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway. A condensed glauconitic chalk interval of Early Campanian age (Nannofossil Zone CC 18 of Sissingh) overlies the laminated shales at both sites. This interval contains benthic foraminiferal faunas reflecting increasing bottom-water oxygenation and reduced organic-matter flux. This glauconitic chalk is strongly condensed and contains most of the Lower and mid-Campanian. Benthic foraminiferal species indicative of well-oxygenated and more oligotrophic environments characterise the overlying mid- to Upper Campanian nannofossil chalk. During deposition of the nannofossil chalk, a permanent deep-water connection between the central and <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Oceans</b> is proposed, leading to ventilated and well-oxygenated bottom waters. If this speculation is true, the establishment of a permanent deep-water connection between the central and <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Oceans</b> terminated Oceanic Anoxic Event 3 "black shale" formation in the central and <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> marginal basins during the Early Campanian (Nannofossil Zone CC 18) and led to well-oxygenated bottom waters in the entire <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> during the Late Campanian (at least from Nannofossil Zone CC 22 onwards) ...|$|R
