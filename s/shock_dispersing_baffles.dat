40|$|Nonlinear {{acoustic}} wave propagation through a stratified atmosphere is considered. The initial signal {{is taken to}} be an isolated N-wave, which is the disturbance that is generated some distance away from a supersonic body in horizontal flight. The effect of cylindrical spreading and exponential density stratification on the propagation of the disturbance is considered, with the shock structure controlled by molecular relaxation mechanisms and by thermoviscous diffusion. An augmented Burgers equation is obtained and asymptotic solutions are derived based on the limit of small dissipation and dispersion. For a single relaxation mode, the solution depends on whether relaxation alone can support the shock or whether a sub-shock arises controlled by other mechanisms. The resulting shock structures are known as fully dispersed and partly <b>dispersed</b> <b>shocks,</b> respectively. In this paper, the spatial location of the transition between fully dispersed and partly <b>dispersed</b> <b>shocks</b> is identified for shocks propagating {{above and below the}} horizontal. This phenomenon is important in understanding the character of sonic booms since the transition to a partly <b>dispersed</b> <b>shock</b> structure leads to the appearance of a shorter scale in the shock rise-time, associated with the embedded sub-shock.

40|$|In this paper, the {{two-dimensional}} particle-laden flow {{developments are}} studied with bronze particle {{cloud in the}} accelerated flow behind a running shock. The forty thousands particle clouds are arranged initially in a rectangular, triangular and circular shape. The flows are computed with a recently developed high-order Eulerian-Lagrangian method, that approximates the Euler equations governing the gas dynamics with the improved high order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO-Z) scheme, while individual particles are traced in the Lagrangian frame using high-order time integration schemes. A high-order ENO interpolation determines the carrier phase properties at the particle location. A high-order central weighing deposits the particle influence on the carrier phase. Reflected shocks form ahead of all the cloud shapes. The detached shock {{in front of the}} triangular cloud is weakest. At later times the wake behind the cloud becomes unstable and a two-dimensional vortex-dominated wake forms. Separated shear layers {{at the edges of the}} clouds pulls particles initially out of the clouds that are consequently transported along the shear layers. Since flows separated trivially at sharp corners, particles are mostly transported out of the cloud into the flow at the sharp front corner of the rectangular cloud, and the trailing corner of the triangular cloud. Particles are transported smoothly out of the circular cloud, since it lacks sharp corners. At late times, the accelerated flow behind the running <b>shock</b> <b>disperses</b> the particles in cross-stream direction the most for the circular cloud, followed by the rectangular cloud and the triangular cloud.

40|$|Shock {{capturing}} algorithms {{are widely}} used for simulations of compressible fluid flow. Though these algorithms resolve a shock wave {{within a couple of}} grid points, the artificial length scale from the numerical shock profile can have side effects. The side effects are similar to physical effects that occur when a relaxation process gives rise to fully or partly <b>dispersed</b> <b>shock</b> waves. Two anomalies due to a non-zero shock width are discussed: (1) in one-dimension, a non-decaying entropy spike results from a transient when a shock profile is formed or changed; (2) in multi-dimensions, front curvature affects the propagation of a shock wave. The authors show that both the entropy anomaly and the curvature effect are a natural consequence of the conservation laws. The same analysis applies both to the continuum equations and to their finite difference approximations in conservation form. Consequently, the artificial length scale inherent in a shock capturing algorithm can mimic real physical effects that are associated with partly <b>dispersed</b> <b>shock</b> waves...|$|R

By applying the present model to the analysis of high S/N PSPC spectra of three O-stars (#zeta# Pup, #iota# Ori, #zeta# Ori), we achieve fits of almost the same quality with only two parameters.

40|$|Heat shock {{transcription}} factor 1 (HSF- 1) activates the transcription of heat shock genes in eukaryotes. Under normal physiological growth conditions, HSF- 1 is a monomer. Its transcriptional activity is repressed by constitutive phosphorylation. Upon activation, HSF- 1 forms trimers, acquires DNA binding activity, increases transcriptional activity, and appears as punctate granules in the nucleus. In this study, using bromouridine incorporation and confocal laser microscopy, we demonstrated that newly synthesized pre-mRNAs colocalize to the HSF- 1 punctate granules after heat shock, suggesting that these granules are sites of transcription. We further present evidence that glycogen synthase kinase 3 Î² (GSK- 3 Î²) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK MAPK) {{participate in the}} down regulation of HSF- 1 transcriptional activity. Transient increases in the expression of GSK- 3 Î² facilitate the disappearance of HSF- 1 punctate granules and reduce hsp- 70 transcription after heat shock.

Melting causes solitary waves to decrease in amplitude but the process is reversible and freezing can cause small perturbations in the fluid flux to amplify into large-amplitude waves. These model problems show that the equations governing volume changes of the matrix are inherently time dependent. Perturbations to steady-state solutions propagate as nonlinear waves and these problems demonstrate several initial conditions that do not relax to steady state. If these equations describe processes such as magma migration in the Earth, then these processes should be inherently episodic in space and time. 1...|$|R
40|$|An active {{flow control}} concept using counterflowing jets to {{significantly}} modify the external flowfields and strongly weaken or disperse the shock-waves of supersonic and hypersonic vehicles {{to reduce the}} aerothermal loads and wave drag was investigated. Experiments were conducted in a trisonic blow-down wind-tunnel, complemented by pre-test computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of a 2. 6 % scale model of Apollo capsule, with and without counterflowing jets, in Mach 3. 48 and 4. 0 freestreams, to assess the potential aerothermal and aerodynamic benefits of this concept. The model was instrumented with heat flux gauges, thermocouples and pressure taps, and employed five counterflowing jet nozzles (three sonic and other two supersonic with design Mach numbers of 2. 44 and 2. 94) and nozzle exit diameters ranging from 0. 25 to 0. 5 inch. Schlieren data show that at low jet flow rates of 0. 05 and 0. 1 lb(sub m) /sec, the interactions result in a long penetration mode (LPM) jet, while the short penetration mode (SPM) jet is observed at flow rates greater than 0. 1 lb(sub m) /sec., consistent with the pre-test CFD predictions. For the LPM, the jet appears to be nearly fully-expanded, resulting in a very unsteady and oscillatory flow structure in which the bow <b>shock</b> becomes highly <b>dispersed</b> such {{that it is no}} longer discernable. Higher speed camera Schlieren data reveal the <b>shock</b> to be <b>dispersed</b> into striations of compression waves, which suddenly coalesce to a weaker bow shock with a larger standoff distance as the flow rate reached a critical value. The pronounced shock dispersion could significantly impact the aerodynamic performance (L/D) and heat flux reduction of spacecraft in atmospheric entry and re-entry, and could also attenuate the entropy layer in hypersonic blunt body flows. For heat transfer, the results show significant reduction in heat flux, even giving negative heat flux for some of the SPM interactions, indicating that the flow wetting the model is cooling, instead of heating the model, which could significantly impact the requirements and design of thermal protection system. These findings strongly suggest that the application of counterflowing jets as active flow control could have strong impact on supersonic and hypersonic vehicle design and performance...|$|R

40|$|An {{extended}} fluid-dynamic {{model for}} micron-scale flows with heat transfer {{based on the}} Gaussian moment closure is presented. The standard Gaussian closue moment equations are hyperbolic and closure is achieved by assuming a form for the velocity distribution function which will, by construction, yield zero heat flux; the proposed extension leads to the addition of anisotropic thermal-diffusion terms having an elliptic nature.

The elliptic nature of the additional generalized heat-flux terms lead to fully <b>dispersed</b> <b>shock</b> wave solutions, unlike the partially dispersed solutions provided by the Gaussian closure as the Mach number increases. Using a Godunov-type finite-volume scheme with block based adaptive-mesh refinement (AMR) on body-fitted multi-block meshes, the proposed equations are applied to several canonical continuum and micron-scale flow situations such as shock structure, Couette flow, and flow past a circular cylinder, as well as for transonic flow past a micro airfoil.

40|$|In {{a number}} of {{recently}} published studies, it was demonstrated that polyurea possesses a high shockwave-mitigation capacity, i. e. an ability to attenuate and <b>disperse</b> <b>shocks.</b> Polyurea is a segmented thermoplastic elastomer which possesses a meso-scale segregated microstructure consisting of (high glass-transition temperature, T g) hydrogen-bonded discrete hard domains and a (low T g) contiguous soft matrix. Details of the polyurea microstructure (such as the extent of meso-segregation, morphology {{and the degree of}} short-range order and crystallinity within the hard domains) are all sensitive functions of the polyurea chemistry and its synthesis route. It has been widely accepted that the shockwave-mitigation capacity of polyurea is closely related to its meso-phase microstructure. However, it is not presently clear what microstructure-dependent phenomena and processes are responsible for the superior shockwave-mitigation capacity of this material. To help identify these phenomena and processes, meso-scale coarse-grained simulations of the formation of meso-segregated microstructure and its interaction with the shockwave is analyzed in the present work. It is found that shockwave-induced hard-domain densification makes an important contribution to the superior shockwave-mitigation capacity of polyurea, and that the extent of densification is a sensitive function of the polyurea soft-segment molecular weight. Specifically, the ability of release waves to capture and neutralize shockwaves has been found to depend strongly on the extent of shockwave-induced hard-domain densification...|$|R
40|$|Several {{experimental}} investigations {{reported in}} the open literature clearly established that polyurea (PU), an elastic copolymer, has an unusually high ability to attenuate and <b>disperse</b> <b>shock</b> waves. This behavior of PU is normally attributed to its unique nanometer-scale two-phase microstructure consisting of (high glass-transition temperature, Tg) hydrogen-bonded discrete, hard domains dispersed within a (low Tg) contiguous soft matrix. However, details regarding the mechanism(s) responsible for the superior shock-wave miti-gation capacity of PU are still elusive. In the present study, molecular-level computational methods and tools are used to help us identify and characterize these mechanism(s). Because the shock-wave front structure and propagation involve coordinated motion {{of a large number}} of atoms and nano-second to micro-second characteristic times, these phenomena cannot be readily analyzed using all-atom molecular-level modeling and simulation techniques. To overcome this problem, all-atom PU microstructure is coarse-grained by introducing larger particles (beads), which account for the collective degrees of freedom of the constituent atoms, the associated force-field functions determined and parameterized using all-atom com-putational results, and the resulting coarse-grained model analyzed using conventional molecular-level computational methods and tools. The results thus obtained revealed that a combination of different deformation mechanisms (primarily shock-induced ordering and crystallization of hard domains and coordinated shuffle-like lateral motion of the soft-matrix segments) is most likely responsible for the superior ability of PU to attenuate/disperse shock waves...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of flows with shock waves typically use finite-difference shock-capturing algorithms. These algorithms give a shock a numerical width {{in order to}} generate the entropy increase that must occur across a shock wave. For algorithms in conservation form, steady-state shock waves are insensitive to the numerical dissipation because of the Hugoniot jump conditions. However, localized numerical errors occur when shock waves interact. Examples are the ``excess wall heating`` in the Noh problem (shock reflected from rigid wall), errors when a shock impacts a material interface or an abrupt change in mesh spacing, and the start-up error from initializing a shock as a discontinuity. This class of anomalies {{can be explained by}} the entropy generation that occurs in the transient flow when a shock profile is formed or changed. The entropy error is localized spatially but under mesh refinement does not decrease in magnitude. Similar effects have been observed in shock tube experiments with partly <b>dispersed</b> <b>shock</b> waves. In this case, the shock has a physical width due to a relaxation process. An entropy anomaly from a transient shock interaction is inherent in the structure of the conservation equations for fluid flow. The anomaly can be expected to occur whenever heat conduction can be neglected and a shock wave has a non-zero width, whether the width is physical or numerical. Thus, the numerical anomaly from an artificial shock width mimics a real physical effect...|$|R

The affect of translational nonequilibrium on the relaxation process has been studied by forming an asymptotic expansion in the ratio of the viscous length to the relaxation length. The perturbation scheme was singular and required the application at the method of matched asymptotic expansions. Bimodal relaxation has been studied by forming an asymptotic expansion in the ratio of the energy of the secondary vibrational mode to the total Vibrational energy. The addition of a second order term to the rate equation describing the behaviour of a single vibrational mode has also been studied by forming an asymptotic expansion.
