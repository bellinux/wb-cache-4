40|$|A new {{procedure}} is proposed {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of surveillance satellites in circular orbits. It is assumed that the times of target detections by the satellite are given by a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with detection rate at time t of p(t) = f(lambda(t), Beta sub 1 (t), Beta sub 2 (t)), where lambda(t) is the angular distance between the target and <b>subsatellite</b> <b>point,</b> Beta sub 1 (t) is great circle bearing from the target to the <b>subsatellite</b> <b>point,</b> and Beta sub 2 (t) is great circle relative bearing from the <b>subsatellite</b> <b>point</b> to the target. In some circumstances, the dependence of p(t) on Beta sub 2 (t) and Beta sub 2 (t) can be ignored, making p(t) only a function of lambda(t). Then the probability of target detection on a single satellite pass becomes a function of only the minimum angular distance, or lateral range, between the target and <b>subsatellite</b> <b>point.</b> A numerical method using Newton's method is developed for computing the local minimum of lambda(t). Probabilities of detection using this procedure are compared to those computed with existing methods of Wertz and Washburn. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the problem of}} precise autonomous orbit control of a spacecraft in a low Earth orbit. Autonomous onboard orbit control means that the spacecraft maintains its ground track close to a reference trajectory, without operator intervention. The problem is formulated as a specific case of two spacecraft in formation in which one, the reference, is virtual and affected only by the Earth’s gravitational field. A new parametrization, the relative Earth-fixed elements, is introduced to describe the relative motion of the two spacecraft’s <b>subsatellite</b> <b>points</b> on the Earth surface. These relative elements enable the translation of absolute-into-relative orbit-control requirements and the straightforward use of modern control-theory techniques for orbit control. As a demonstration, linear and quadratic optimum regulators are designed and compared, by means of numerical simulations, with an analytical autonomous orbit-control algorithm that has been validated in flight. The differences of the numerical and analytical control methods are identified and discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} satellite-borne radar {{altimeter}} data {{to measure the}} global ocean surface with high precision and dense spatial coverage provides a unique tool for the mapping of the Earth's gravity field and its geoid. The altimeter crossover measurements, created by differencing direct altimeter measurements at the <b>subsatellite</b> <b>points</b> where the orbit ground tracks intersect, have the distinct advantage of eliminating geoid error and other nontemporal or long period oceanographic features. In the 1990 's, the joint U. S. /French TOPEX/POSEIDON mission and the European Space Agency's ERS- 1 mission will carry radar altimeter instruments capable of global ocean mapping with high precision. This investigation aims at the development and application of dynamically consistent direct altimeter and altimeter crossover measurement models to the simultaneous mapping of the Earth's gravity field and its geoid, the ocean tides and the quasi-stationary component of the dynamic sea surface topography.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The analysis {{was based on}} a time series intrinsic relationship between the satellite ephemeris, altimeter measured ranges, and the corresponding a priori values of subsatellite geoidal heights. Using sequential least squares processing with parameter weighting, the objective was to recover (1) the absolute geoidal heights of the <b>subsatellite</b> <b>points,</b> and (2) the associated altimeter calibration constant(s). Preliminary results from Skylab altimetry are given, using various combinations of orbit ephemeris and altimeter ranges as computed differently by NASA/JSC and NASA/Wallops. The influences of orbit accuracy, weighting functions, and a priori ground truth are described, based on the various combination solutions. It is shown that to deduce geoidal height by merely subtracting the height of the satellite from the altimeter range is inadmissible. The results of such direct subtraction can be very misleading if the orbit used is computed from data that included altimeter data used as height constraints. In view of the current state of knowledge, the use of geodetic ground truth samples as control benchmarks appears indispensable for the recovery of absolute geoidal heights with correct scale...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{limiting}} {{factors in the}} determination of global gravity field parameters is the spatial sampling, namely during phases when the satellite is in an orbit with few revolutions for each repeat cycle. This often happens when it is freely passing (drifting) through the atmosphere and encountering {{a fair number of}} such deficient repeat orbits. This research was triggered in 2004 by the significant but only temporary, 2 – 3 months long, decrease of the accuracy of monthly solutions for the gravity field variations derived from GRACE. The reason for the dip was the 61 / 4 resonance in the GRACE orbits in autumn 2004. At this resonance, the ground track density dramatically decreased and large (mainly longitude) gaps appeared in the data-coverage of the globe. The problem of spatial sampling has been studied repeatedly (Wagner et al., 2006; Klokočník et al., 2008; Weigelt et al., 2009) and simple rules have been derived to limit the maximum order for unconstrained solutions (inversions) for the gravity field parameters or their variations from observations of a single satellite. Here we work with the latest rule from Weigelt et al. (2013) which distinguishes the maximum attainable order according to the parity of the two parameters defining the repeat orbit or orbital resonance, β the number of nodal satellite’s revolutions in α nodal days (α, β co-prime integers, the ratio β/α irreducible). This rule, that the resolvable order (in a repeat near polar orbit) should be β for odd parity (β − α) and β/ 2 for even parity (β − α) orbits, arose from the discovery that the number of distinct and equally spaced equatorial crossings (ascending and descending passes) for odd parity (β − α) is 2 β while for even parity orbits it is only β. We extend this insight over all achievable latitudes and assess the ground track density (or coverage) by way of the maximum distances between <b>subsatellite</b> <b>points</b> at arbitrary latitude, specifically for the nearly polar (drifting) orbits of CHAMP, GRACE, and the repeat tuned GOCE. We demonstrate clearly how latitude (and also the orbital inclination) is important and affects the choice of an order resolution limit. A new rule, compromising between β and β/ 2 for each specific repeat orbit, is proposed, based on the average maximum distance between <b>subsatellite</b> <b>points</b> over the achievable latitudes. Although these findings allow an initial estimate of recoverability based solely on the global spatial sampling of the ground track, a more refined analysis involving the inversion of specific observations is still outstanding.

A summary of the documentation for each Nimbus 6 Data Catalog volume is presented. The pitch of the Nimbus 6 satellite has been made to alternate between + 2. 0 degrees, + 0. 6 degrees, and 0. 0 degrees since launch. A positive pitch angle of 0. 6 degrees moves the nadir-looking position 11. 5 kilometers ahead of the <b>subsatellite</b> <b>point.</b> A positive pitch angle of 2. 0 degrees moves the nadir-looking position 38. 3 kilometers ahead of the <b>subsatellite</b> <b>point.</b> At these pitch angles, a scanner-type instrument no longer scans the earth along a great circle arc through the subpoint, but scans along the small circle formed by the intersection of the scan plane with the earth. Since the plane of the small circle is tilted with respect to the nominal scan plane, points on the arc are displaced farther from the great circle as the scan angle increases. As noted above, a pitch angle of 0. 6 degrees causes a displacement of 11. 5 kilometers at nadir, but when the scanner turns 45 degrees away from nadir the displacement increases slightly to 12. 8 kilometers. Similarly, for a 2. 0 degree pitch the displacement is 38. 3 kilometers at nadir and increases to 42. 6 kilometers at a 45 degree scan angle. Thus, although the instrument records in lines normal to the orbit plane (in the absence of yaw) the perpendicular displacement from the perfect-attitude scan line is not uniform across the scan line...|$|E

The study was applied over Tropical Africa at the MSG <b>subsatellite</b> <b>point,</b> in August 2006. Sixteen individual profile types were detected: three warm, four convective, three stratiform without bright band, and six stratiform with bright band. These cloud profile types were examined using cloud-top multichannel brightness temperature differences. The channel combination results demonstrated that the information obtained from cloud-top radiation enables us to detect specific individual characteristics within the cloud reflectivity profile.

Cold clouds types were much more difficult to classify because they possess a similar multichannel signature, which caused ambiguity in the classification. In order to reduce this uncertainty, it was necessary to use texture information (space variability) to acquire a clearer distinction between different cloud types.

Using these data, we are able to quantitatively derive detailed macro- and microphysical properties of clouds at an unprecendented time resolution of 15 minutes, allowing {{for the first time to}} study the formation, evolution, and dissipation of clouds from space. The investigation of the temporal evolution of the droplet and particle radius of clouds has the potential to shed new light e. g. on the process of rain formation. The modification of the cloud micro- and macrophysical structure with time has a strong impact on radiative forcing and consequently on climate. We will show examples of the temporal evolution of the main cloud properties, optical thickness, phase, and effective radius. A particular attention will be given to cirrus clouds because - due to their high altitude close to the coldest point of the radiatively relevant atmosphere - their trapping of thermal radiation often over-compensates the reflection of solar radiation, thus leading to a considerable warming of the Earth-atmosphere system in particular during night time. The time step of 15 minutes allows conclusions about the origin of clouds, and helps to better quantify their effect on the radiation budget.
