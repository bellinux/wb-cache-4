40|$|The {{issue of}} food safety is {{increasingly}} becoming the focus of social concerns, and breakage of packaging film is the main threat {{to the safety of}} <b>sealing</b> <b>packaging</b> food. For the small damage that is difficult to see with the naked eyes, according to that the impedance of damaged position is different from that of other position, the discharge signals of <b>sealing</b> <b>packaging</b> food in different damaged conditions are different in high voltage dielectric barrier discharge circuit, and then they are collected and analyzed. In order to solve the problem that different discharge signals are similar and characteristics are confused, wavelet packet and the EEMD method are novelly used to analyze discharge signals and the characteristic parameters of <b>sealing</b> <b>packaging</b> food that is intact or has pinholes are successfully extracted. This method solves the problem that the tiny damage is difficult to identify and detect, and it also provides a new train of thought for online test of <b>sealing</b> <b>packaging</b> food. et al; Hong Kong Industrial Technology Research Centre; Inha University; Korea Maritime University; National Chengchi University, Taiwan; Queensland University of Technolog...|$|R

40|$|It {{remains a}} {{challenge}} to generate cold, atmospheric pressure plasmas in <b>sealed</b> <b>packages</b> for biological disinfection. In this paper, we report a plasma device to form large-area and atmospheric-pressure plasmas in a <b>sealed</b> <b>package</b> for the low-temperature disinfection of fungi. The visually uniform plasmas were easily generated in the portable plastic bag containing Candida albicans {{with a population of}} 105 spores placed on the plasma device. The He plasma containing about 1 % O 2 was found to entirely kill resistant Candida albicans with a treatment time of 5 min. Measurements for optical emission spectra and disinfection efficiencies indicate that the plasma-created species such as O radicals and charged species {{play a major role in}} the inactivation process. In this work, we propose a plasma device able to produce macroscopically uniform plasmas at atmospheric pressure which can be used for plasma-assisted disinfections. The resistant Candida albicans in a <b>sealed</b> <b>package</b> was used for our disinfection experiments. The results indicated that the O radicals, along with charged species are main contributors in plasma inactivation by this method. Copyright 漏 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Aims: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the inactivation efficacy of dielectric barrier discharge atmospheric cold plasma (DBD-ACP) generated inside a <b>sealed</b> <b>package</b> for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Methods and Results: A plasma discharge was generated between two circular aluminium electrodes at 40 kV. E. coli suspensions (10 ^ 7 CFU/ml) in either maximum recovery diluent (MRD) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were treated in a 96 -well microtitre plate inside a <b>sealed</b> <b>package.</b> The effects of treatment time, post-treatment storage time, either direct or indirect samples exposure to the plasma discharge and suspension media were studied. Regardless of the media tested, 20 s of direct and 45 s of indirect plasma treatment resulted in complete bacterial inactivation (7 log CFU/ml). At the lower plasma treatment times (10 – 30 s) investigated, the effects of suspension media and mode of exposure on the inactivation efficacy were evident. The inactivation efficacy was also influenced by the post-treatment storage time. Conclusions: It was demonstrated that the novel DBD-ACP can inactivate high concentrations of E. coli suspended in liquids within <b>sealed</b> <b>packages</b> in seconds. Significance and impact of the Study: A key advantage of this in-package nonthermal novel disinfection approach is the elimination of post-processing contamination...|$|R
