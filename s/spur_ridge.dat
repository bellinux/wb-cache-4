Sibidang provided an excellent observation {{point for the}} surrounding area, and US artillery emplaced in the Komam-ni area could interdict the road junction at Chungam-ni. The US 35th Infantry Regiment set up positions at Sibidang-Komam-ni, {{in the northern part}} of the 25th Infantry Division defense line. The 35th Regiment line extended from a point [...] west of Komam-ni to the Nam River and then turned east along that stream to its confluence with the Naktong River. It was a long regimental line, about , twice the length a regiment was typically assigned.|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} campaign that followed was focussed on the recapture of strategically vital castles on the Northumbrian border. Alnwick Castle was commanded by a shell keep, to which extra towers had been added, {{as well as}} to the curtain wall, with a solid barbican and gatehouse. Bamburgh Castle was on a high <b>spur</b> <b>ridge</b> with three baileys, a large keep, and fortified gateways. Dunstanburgh Castle stood on a dolerite spur which had the sheer drop of a cliff on one side. Montagu besieged Bamburgh, the most important of these northern bulwarks, due to its distance from London and proximity to Scotland. By 26 December 1461, when the garrison surrendered, they 'had been reduced to eating their horses.' ...|$|E

There the line turned south along rising ground to Sibidang-san, crossed the saddle on its south face through which passed the Chinju-Masan railroad and highway, and continued southward up to Battle Mountain and on to P'il-bong. From P'il-bong the line dropped down <b>spur</b> <b>ridge</b> lines to the southern coastal road near Chindong-ni. The US 35th Infantry Regiment held the northern [...] of the division line, from the Namji-ri bridge to the Chinju-Masan highway. The regiment was responsible for the highway. The regiment's weakest and most vulnerable point was a [...] gap along the Naktong River between most of F Company on the west and its 1st Platoon to the east. This platoon guarded the Namji-ri cantilever steel bridge on the division extreme right at the boundary with the US 2nd Infantry Division, which was across the Naktong River. South of the highway, the US 24th Infantry Regiment held the high ground west of Haman, including Battle Mountain and P'il-bong. Colonel John L. Throckmorton's US 5th Infantry Regimental Combat Team held the southern spur of Sobuk-san to the coastal road at Chindong-ni. From Chindong-ni some ROK Marine Corps units continued the line to the southern coast. Kean's 25th Division command post was at Masan, the 35th Infantry command post was on the east side of the Chirwon–Chung-ni road, the 24th Infantry command post was at Haman and Colonel Throckmorton's command post was at Chindong-ni. By August 31, the division was suffering manpower shortages, and a limited number of KATUSAs (English-speaking Korean troops) were brought in to replenish its ranks.|$|E
