By party affiliation, 19% of Republicans, 27% of Independents, and 59% of Democrats favored the mandate. Other polls showed additional provisions receiving majority support, including the creation of insurance exchanges, pooling <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> <b>and</b> the uninsured with other consumers so that more people {{can take advantage of}} large group pricing benefits and providing subsidies to individuals and families to make health insurance more affordable.|$|E

40|$|Explanations of cross-national {{variations}} {{in the level of}} <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> entrepreneurial activity have typically not distinguished between different industry sectors and have tended to focus on general framework conditions affecting <b>small</b> <b>business</b> including macroeconomic variables and regulatory and cultural factors. However, sectoral patterns of <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> entrepreneurial activity also vary cross-nationally and require further explanation. This paper develops a framework for analysis of the conditions of small firms in knowledge intensive sectors that takes into account the stock of knowledge and competence in the economy, the capacity to generate and commercialise new ideas and the strength of regional systems of innovation. An analysis of the Australian and Swedish context shows that macroeconomic, regulatory and cultural factors explain a general bias in the Australian economy towards <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> entrepreneurship. However, the paper draws attention to the very different pattern that emerges with respect to <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> entrepreneurial activity in knowledge sectors. The stock of knowledge and competence, capacity to generate and commercialise ideas and strength of regional innovation systems seems to explain Sweden’s superior performance in <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> entrepreneurial activity in knowledge intensive activities...|$|R
