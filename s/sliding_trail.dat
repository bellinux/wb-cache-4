40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the optimal design of a Seamless Aeroelastic Wing (SAW) structure for a light weight aircraft. Attention was firstly paid to a design concept of a hinge-less flexible trailing edge control surface and the actuation mechanism. By creating an innovative <b>sliding</b> <b>trailing</b> edge and improving an existing curved torque beam design, the SAW camber can be varied in a desirable shape with minimum control power demand. This design concept has been simulated numerically and demonstrated by a test model. Since the wing loading is relatively small for a small scale aircraft, strength and flutter are not the major design constraints for weight saving. Due to a large sweptback angle, significant bending-torsion coupling makes the bending stiffness play a very important role in the aeroelastic stability. As a result, the control efficiency becomes a main concern in the wing design. The subsequent effort was therefore made to optimise the wing structure configuration and aeroelastic tailoring. The results showed that an initial base line example structural weight was reduced by approximately 30 % under the strength criteria. The resulting reduction of the wing box stiffness and aeroelastic stability were improved by applying aeroelastic tailoring...|$|R
5000|$|Immediately east of Devil's Slide was {{a former}} stretch of California State Route 1, famous for {{closures}} and landslides, which also was called [...] "Devil's Slide". Construction of the road began in 1935 and was completed in 1936, replacing the steep, narrow, and winding Pedro Mountain Road. It was known for the landslides and erosion that often occur during winter storms, sometimes making the road impassable. The first major landslide destroyed much of the road in 1940, and a cycle of building and destruction has prevailed since. Seventy-six years after building an extension of Highway 1 at Devils Slide, Caltrans was ready {{to shut down the}} landslide-prone coastal road forever and open a pair of state-of-the-art tunnels through a mountainside behind the precarious cliffs. On March 25, 2013, the Tom Lantos Tunnels opened within the promontory to provide a safer route through the mountains.

2500|$|The Gateway to the Narrows Trail, {{also known}} as the Riverside Walk, [...] is a {{relatively}} short nature trail of one mile along the Virgin River. It connects the parking area at the Temple of Sinawava with The Narrows and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The trail uses local materials such as red sandstone to blend with its surroundings, following the tenets of the National Park Service Rustic style. Survey work was carried out in 1928 by National Park Service engineer Guy D. Edwards. Construction began the following year under the supervision of Walter Ruesch. On August 1, 1968 a rock slide buried a 250-foot portion of the trail with debris ranging from three to twenty feet deep. Rather than removing the rock, the trail was routed over the <b>slide.</b> The <b>trail</b> was upgraded for accessibility by the handicapped in 1982.

He helped design the narrow gauge railroad that once connected it to Sonestown.Among the five large resort hotels serving the area from the 1880s to 1940s was the Forest Inn, opened in 1902. Its guests included General George C. Marshall and theater director Alvina Krause. Lucy McCammon (a faculty member at nearby Bloomsburg State) and Miss Krause (her longtime companion) leased the Inn's Eagles Mere Playhouse in 1945 and ran it for twenty years; it featured performers such asPatricia Neal, Jimmy Gheen, Charlton Heston, Jennifer Jones, Paula Prentiss, and Richard Benjamin.That troupe is gone, but in 1993 the Dewire Community Center was the site of a nationally recognized summer drama workshop.|$|R

5000|$|The French 75 {{introduced}} a new concept in artillery technology: rapid firing without realigning the gun after each shot. Older artillery had to be resighted after each shot {{in order to stay}} on target, and thus fired no more than two aimed shots per minute. The French 75 easily delivered fifteen aimed rounds per minute and could fire even faster for short periods of time. This rate of fire, the gun's accuracy, and the lethality of the ammunition against personnel, made the French 75 superior to all other regimental field artillery at the time. When made ready for action, the first shot buried the trail spade and the two wheel anchors into the ground, following which all other shots were fired from a stable platform. Bringing down the wheel anchors tied to the braking system was called [...] "abattage". The gun could not be elevated beyond eighteen degrees, unless the trail spade had been deeply dug into the ground; however, the 75 mm field gun was not designed for plunging fire. The gun could be traversed laterally 3 degrees to the sides by <b>sliding</b> the <b>trail</b> on the wheel's axle. Progressive traversing together with small changes in elevation could be carried out while continuously firing, called [...] "fauchage" [...] or [...] "sweeping fire". A 4-gun battery firing shrapnel could deliver 17,000 ball projectiles over an area 100 meters wide by 400 meters long in a single minute, with devastating results. Because of the gun's traversing ability, the longer the distance to the enemy concentration, the wider the area that could be swept.|$|R
50|$|Opens {{normally}} like {{a traditional}} van sliding door, but unlike most sliding doors where the track ison {{the exterior of}} the vehicle, this type has it inside and {{on the side of the}} door itself. This allows the exterior to remain clean in design and yet the door can <b>slide</b> past the <b>trailing</b> edge of the car. However, this design is very unusual and can only be found on the Mitsubishi RVR (Space Runner, not ASX). Invented by Mitsubishi Motors, it was designed because the RVR is a short car compared to the size of the siding door, making it incapable of having a track on {{the exterior of the}} car. Thus, the inner-track mechanism was used so the sliding door can slide open wide enough to let passengers enter and exit the car easily. The new Mitsubishi EK Wagon/Nissan Otti also uses this type of sliding door, but has it only on one side while the driver's side door of the back seats is a normal hinge door. The sliding door of the EK wagon is also electric-powered.|$|R

At about 8:30 a.m. on December 20, 1943, Sergeant Vosler left on his fourth combat mission. His airplane, on its 28th combat flight, was a B-17F named the [...] "Jersey Bounce Jr.," [...] S/N 42-29664. The plane and crew reached the target area of Bremen, Germany, just before noon. The bombers encountered concentrated, accurate and intense flak over Axis territory. In addition to the anti-aircraft fire, about 125 German fighters repeatedly attacked the formation. This was a costly mission for the 8th Air Force, a total of 27 bombers were lost including the Jersey Bounce Jr. after it ditched in the North Sea. During the ditching, Vosler also saved the tail gunner's life. The badly wounded gunner (Sgt.

At this time Vosler had one eye badly wounded from a 20mm cannon shell that exploded right on his turret gun.|$|R
40|$|Pedal mucus is {{important}} for locomotion. protection and signal transmission in the Gastropoda. It also provides nutrients and a habitat for microbes. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} pedal mucus and the mucus trail of the small abalone, Haliotis diversicolor, on bacterial growth, attachment, biofilm formation and community structure. The results showed that pedal mucus enhanced the growth of bacteria, and that more opportunistic pathogens attached to a substrate covered with pedal mucus (for Vibrio alginolyticus, the cell density was up to 5 times higher than on a clean substrate). During microplate assay, when pedal mucus was added as the sole nutrient source, V. alginolyticus formed a biofilm, but few cells grew {{on the bottom of the}} wells if no mucus was added. Under flow-cell culture conditions, differently structured biofilms were formed in the clean and pedal mucus conditioned glass <b>slides.</b> The mucus <b>trail</b> induced a heterogeneous biofilm with cell clusters. Moreover, pedal mucus could support much more CFUs than the clean substrates. Using denatured gradient gel electrophoresis comparison of the bacterial community on a clean substrate and in the mucus trail, we found several specific species in the latter. At least one species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, is potentially harmful to the small abalone. In summary, the pedal mucus of Haliotis diversicolor enriched bacterial occurrence, including some pathogens, which deserves to be considered in high density culture conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|O {{manejo de}} água para o desenvolvimento da alfafa cv. Crioula foi avaliado a campo, com a finalidade de verificar seus efeitos no estabelecimento da planta, até o 1 º corte, em 1997. Para isso, verificou-se o comportamento em três estádios de desenvolvimento (E 1 = início do estádio vegetativo, E 2 = vegetativo pleno e E 3 = reprodutivo até colheita) em quatro níveis de água (A = 100 %, B = 80 %, C = 45 - 50 % e D = 20 - 25 % de uma lâmina de irrigação por aspersão). Foram avaliados oito experimentos: 111, 110, 100, 101, 001, 011, 010, 000, em que o primeiro dígito se refere a E 1; o segundo, a E 2; e o terceiro, a E 3. O valor 0 representa a época em que o estádio não recebeu água, coberto por uma estrututura móvel, que deslizava sobre trilhos, e também protegia contra precipitações pluviais casuais. O valor 1 refere-se à época em que houve aplicação dos níveis de água de irrigação. Os estádios de desenvolvimento da planta, em termos de rendimento de matéria seca, responderam de maneira diferente às condições hídricas, sendo E 2 e E 3 (planta estabelecida) os mais sensíveis e E 1 (início do estádio vegetativo), o menos sensível, no qual a água foi {{prejudicial}} ao estabelecimento e rendimento da planta. The water management for growth of Crioula alfalfa cultivar was evaluated {{in a field}} study, {{in order to assess}} the effects in the plant establishment up to the first cut, at 1977. The study was carried out in 1997. So that, the behaviour at three growth stages (E 1 = early vegetative stage, E 2 = full vegetative stage, and E 3 = reproductive stage until harvest) in the presence of four water levels (A = 100 %, B = 80 %, C = 45 - 50 %, and D = 20 - 25 % from a sprinkler irrigation) was studied. Eight combinations were evaluated: 111, 110, 100, 101, 001, 011, 010, 000, where the first digit is E 1, the second is E 2 and the third is E 3. The number 0 in the figures represents the period in which growth stage did not receive water, cover by a mobile structure, which <b>slide</b> on <b>trail,</b> and also protected against occasional rainfall.

40|$|Surface {{spreading}} of slurry {{leads to}} the inevitable emission of ammonia into the environment. Injection of slurry on grassland reduces these emissions. However, injection of slurry by deep working injector tines with goose foot chisels (wings) requires high draught forces. This type of injection has {{the risk of the}} crop dying back under dry soil conditions and is not possible on all soil types. In recent years, new slurry application techniques for grassland have been developed that achieve a large reduction in emissions of ammonia, but require less draught force. These techniques include cutting a shallow slit in the sward, into which slurry is applied, and application of the slurry in bands on the soil surface using a trailing foot implement. In a series of experiments on sandy loam, day and peat soils, the draught force requirement of single elements of five new slurry application techniques was investigated. The application techniques were a <b>trailed</b> <b>sliding</b> foot element and four shallow injection elements: angled-disc coulters (double-disc opener), thick-disc coulter, flat disc coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter and knife coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter. The application technique, working depth and soil conditions had a significant influence on the draught force. For a working depth of 5 cm, the required draught forces per shallow injector element, measured in this experiment, were in the range of 202 - 706 N for a double-disc opener, 284 - 991 N for a thick-disc coulter, 361 - 1260 N for a flat-disc coulter plus injector and 389 - 1358 N for a knife coulter plus injector. The lowest draught forces occurred on peat soil and the highest forces on dry clay. The trailing foot required an average draught force of 39 N. The draught force of the trailing foot did not relate to the soil conditions but an effect of the grass sward condition was suggested. (C) 1998 Silsoe Research Institute...|$|R
