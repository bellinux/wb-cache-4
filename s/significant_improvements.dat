Later measurements reduced {{the value of the}} mutual inclination, and in the latest four-planet models the incorporation mutual inclinations does not result in <b>significant</b> <b>improvements</b> relative to coplanar solutions.|$|E
30|$|Analysis {{showed a}} {{statistically}} <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> in irritable bowel symptoms and evacuation difficulty (Table  1). Irritable bowel symptoms {{was the second}} most common symptom reported preoperatively (n[*]=[*] 30; 96.77 %); 15 of the 30 patients with preoperative symptoms reported an improvement (p[*]=[*] 0.047) and in 14 patients, the symptom worsened after the surgery. Two (6.45 %) patients reported irritable bowel symptoms to be unaffected by the slingplasty. Twenty of the 29 patients with preoperative symptoms reported <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> (p[*]=[*] 0.014). Although there was no statistically <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> in faecal incontinence and constipation symptoms, the impact of faecal incontinence on the patient showed <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> (p[*]=[*] 0.005), as did the quality of life attributable to the bowel symptoms.|$|R

5|$|Hidden Markov {{models are}} {{probabilistic}} models that can assign likelihoods to all possible combinations of gaps, matches, and mismatches {{to determine the}} most likely MSA or set of possible MSAs. HMMs can produce a single highest-scoring output but can also generate a family of possible alignments that can then be evaluated for biological significance. HMMs can produce both global and local alignments. Although HMM-based methods have been developed relatively recently, they offer <b>significant</b> <b>improvements</b> in computational speed, especially for sequences that contain overlapping regions.|$|E
5|$|The Helgoland {{class was}} {{the second type of}} German dreadnoughts, built during 1908–1912. The class was {{composed}} of four ships: Helgoland, Oldenburg, Ostfriesland, and Thüringen. The ships incorporated <b>significant</b> <b>improvements</b> over the previous Nassau type, including more powerful main guns and an improved propulsion system. The Helgolands were easily distinguished from the preceding Nassaus by the three funnels that were closely arranged, compared to the two larger funnels of the previous class. The ships retained the unusual hexagonal main battery layout of the Nassau class.|$|E
5|$|The Magdeburg class {{introduced}} several <b>significant</b> <b>improvements</b> over earlier designs, {{including a}} more effective bow shape that improved seakeeping and a cut-down quarterdeck that allowed for more efficient handling of the ships' mines. Perhaps most importantly, a waterline armored belt was added to improve the defensive capabilities of the new ships. They also had much more powerful turbines, and as a result, a higher top speed. All following light cruisers adopted these innovations.|$|E

5|$|Continued work {{displayed}} {{a number of}} minor problems, and {{the decision was made}} to introduce a redesigned unit with <b>significant</b> <b>improvements</b> in packaging, insulation, and other practical changes. This would become the AI Mk. V, which began to arrive from Pye in late February and immediately demonstrated a host of problems. By this time the microwave units were being designed, and the Mk. V was almost cancelled. A contract for over 1,000 units was allowed to continue in case of delays in the new units. By May the issues with the Pye design were ironed out, and the FIU's testing revealed it to be superior to the Mk. IV, especially in terms of maintenance. An RAE report agreed.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the efficacy of equine assisted group counseling as compared to in-school curriculum group guidance/counseling. Research examined externalizing, internalizing, maladaptive, and adaptive behaviors of elementary and middle school students who were considered at-risk of academic or social failure. Two types of behavior instruments, the Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC) -Self-Rating, Parent-Rating, and Teacher-Rating Scales; and the Animal Assisted Therapy-Psychosocial Session Form (AAT-PSF), were used in a pretest-posttest comparison group quasi experimental design. Results of the paired sample t-test analysis of the BASC Self-Report indicated that the equine assisted counseling group showed statistically <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> in five behavior areas, and the in-school curriculum group guidance/counseling group showed statistically <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> in four areas, with only one behavior area the same as the equine assisted counseling group. Results of the paired sample t-test analysis of the BASC Parent-Report indicated that the equine assisted counseling group showed statistically <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> in twelve behavior areas, whereas the in-school curriculum group guidance/counseling showed statistically <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> in only one behavior area. Results of the paired sample t-test analysis of the BASC Teacher-Report indicated that the equine assisted counseling group showed no statistically significant improvement; however the in-school curriculum group guidance/counseling group showed statistically <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> in one area. An ANCOVA comparison of equine assisted counseling group verses in-school curriculum guidance/counseling group using the BASC Self, Parent, and Teacher-Reports indicated that the equine assisted counseling group showed statistically <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> in seven behavior areas that the in-school curriculum guidance/counseling group did not. Results of the repeated measures ANOVA of the AAT-PSF (equine assisted counseling group only) showed statistically <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> in all 3 -scale scores: 1) overall total behaviors; 2) increased positive behaviors; and 3) decreased negative behaviors...|$|R

5|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a rise in cases of {{undisclosed}} synthetic diamond melee being found in set jewelry and within diamond parcels sold in the trade. Due to the relatively inexpensive cost of diamond melee, as well as relative lack of universal knowledge for identifying large quantities of melee efficiently, not all dealers have made an effort to test diamond melee to correctly identify whether it is of natural or man-made origin. However, international laboratories are now beginning to tackle the issue head-on, with <b>significant</b> <b>improvements</b> in synthetic melee identification being made.|$|E
5|$|On October 13, Sanchez led USC to a 20–13 victory, {{overcoming}} a wavering {{performance during}} the first half of the game in which he threw two interceptions, as Arizona went on to tie the game heading into halftime. During the second half, Sanchez was more proficient in passing the ball and ultimately finished the game completing 19 of his 31 passes while throwing for 130 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions.

5|$|<b>Significant</b> <b>improvements</b> {{were made}} to the river in the 1660s, when a new cut with 10 locks was {{constructed}} between Stamford and Market Deeping, and two locks were built on the river section below Market Deeping. The canal section was known as the Stamford Canal, and was the longest canal with locks in Britain when it was built. The river provided the final outlet to the sea for land drainage schemes implemented in the seventeenth century, although they were not completely successful until a steam-powered pumping station was built at Pode Hole in 1827. Navigation on the upper river, including the Stamford Canal, had ceased by 1863, but Spalding remained an active port {{until the end of the}} Second World War.|$|E
