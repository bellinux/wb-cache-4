5|$|The time of {{breeding}} {{depends on the}} elevation and latitude of the salamander's habitat. Generally, the lower-elevation <b>salamanders</b> breed in the fall, winter, and early spring. Higher-elevation <b>salamanders</b> breed in spring and early summer. In the higher climates especially, <b>salamanders</b> will enter ponds and lakes that still have ice floating.|$|E
5|$|Diverse life exists {{within the}} range, {{including}} endangered species like Larch Mountain <b>Salamanders</b> and spotted owls. Amphibians like <b>salamanders</b> and frogs are common, as are birds. Mammals {{in the area}} consist of elk, mountain lions, deer, and black bears. Eastern Cascades fish include Lost River suckers and short suckers, which are both endemic species.|$|E

5|$|Food {{is mostly}} {{selected}} by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs {{have been caught}} on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs (Rana clamitans) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past. Toads, <b>salamanders</b> and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because <b>salamanders</b> have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some <b>salamanders</b> seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{amphibians}} (frogs, <b>salamanders,</b> and caecilians) {{are classified}} in Lissamphibia. Lissamphibians {{appear to have}} arisen in the Permian. Molecular clock estimates place the first lissamphibian in the Late Carboniferous, but {{the first member of}} Batrachia (frogs and <b>salamanders,</b> but not caecilians) is estimated to have appeared in the Middle Permian using the same technique.|$|E
5|$|A {{study on}} the fully aquatic Archegosaurus shows that it's heat balance, gas exchange, osmoregulation, and {{digestion}} were more {{similar to those of}} fish than those of modern aquatic amphibians like <b>salamanders.</b>|$|E

5|$|A. macrodactylum is {{a member}} of the Ambystomatidae, also known as the mole <b>salamanders.</b> The Ambystomatidae {{originated}} approximately 81 million years ago (late Cretaceous) from its sister taxon Dicamptodontidae. The Ambystomatidae are also members of suborder Salamandroidea, which includes all the <b>salamanders</b> capable of internal fertilization. The sister species to A.macrodactylum is A. laterale, distributed in eastern North America. However, the species-level phylogeny for Ambystomatidae is tentative and in need of further testing.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians use {{the ephemeral}} natural pools on Scotch Run as a {{breeding}} ground. Amphibians inhabiting the vernal pools on the stream include spring peepers, spotted <b>salamanders,</b> and wood frogs.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{over whether}} temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians (frogs, <b>salamanders,</b> and caecilians), {{or whether the}} whole group died out without leaving any descendants. Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls, another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as descendants of both groups (with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and <b>salamanders</b> evolving from temnospondyls). Recent studies place a family of temnospondyls called the amphibamids as the closest relatives of modern amphibians. Similarities in teeth, skulls, and hearing structures link the two groups.|$|E
50|$|Eurycea neotenes (the Texas <b>salamander,</b> Bexar County <b>salamander,</b> Edwards Plateau <b>salamander,</b> or Texas neotenic <b>salamander)</b> is {{a species}} of entirely aquatic, lungless <b>salamander</b> native to the United States.

5|$|In 2008, Gerobatrachus hottoni, a temnospondyl {{with many}} frog- and salamander-like characteristics, was {{discovered}} in Texas. It dated back 290 million years and was hailed as a missing link, a stem batrachian close to the common ancestor of frogs and <b>salamanders,</b> consistent with the widely accepted hypothesis that frogs and <b>salamanders</b> are {{more closely related to}} each other (forming a clade called Batrachia) than they are to caecilians. However, others have suggested that Gerobatrachus hottoni was only a dissorophoid temnospondyl unrelated to extant amphibians.|$|E
5|$|In most amphibians, {{there are}} four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some <b>salamanders</b> have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in {{appearance}} with tiny, stubby legs. The sirens are aquatic <b>salamanders</b> with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow {{in the manner of}} earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.|$|E
5|$|The calls made by caecilians and <b>salamanders</b> {{are limited}} to {{occasional}} soft squeaks, grunts or hisses and have not been much studied. A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation, as in bats, or a form of communication. Most <b>salamanders</b> are considered voiceless, but the California giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus) has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound. Some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.|$|E

50|$|A unique {{reproductive}} tactic for the Bluespotted-Jefferson <b>Salamander</b> Complex {{exists in}} nature. The Jefferson <b>salamander</b> {{is now known}} not to breed in the lab with the blue-spotted <b>salamander,</b> which was previously thought to produce 'hybrids', the silvery <b>salamander</b> and Tremblay's <b>salamander,</b> between this supposed mating of Jefferson <b>salamander</b> and Blue-spotted <b>salamander.</b> The silvery <b>salamander</b> and Tremblay's <b>salamander</b> are now known through genetic testing to be polyploid females (only 2% of males survive and they are sterile). These most often possess two of each chromosome from the Jefferson <b>salamander</b> and one of each chromosome from the blue-spotted <b>salamander,</b> resulting in an LJJ genotype (also called a Tremblay's <b>salamander.)</b> This genotype results when these polyploid females mate with a pure Jefferson <b>salamander</b> male, incorporating (often in warmer water conditions) the chromosome from the pure male Jefferson <b>salamander</b> into her egg, usually having an LJ diploid chromosome set or LJJ triploid chromosome set, to produce LJJ or LJJJ offspring, respectively. Often in cooler conditions, the LJ or LJJ female may mate with the Jefferson <b>salamander</b> male and only 'borrow' his spermatozoan to trigger genetic cloning of herself, not adding his chromosome (J) to her egg. The same polyploid reproductive strategy occurs for other mole <b>salamander</b> species. The presence of these polyploids {{makes it difficult to}} visually identify which species an individual may be, skewing population measures for both species.|$|R
50|$|Speleomantes strinatii, the French cave <b>salamander,</b> North-west Italian cave <b>salamander,</b> or Strinati's cave <b>salamander.</b> {{is a small}} (10-12.5cm long) {{species of}} <b>salamander</b> found in north-west Italy and {{south-east}} France. It is very similar in appearance to the Italian cave <b>salamander</b> (Speleomantes italicus), but has a paler belly.|$|R
5|$|Conversely, {{poisonous}} or distasteful {{animals that}} advertise their presence with warning coloration (aposematism) use patterns that emphasize rather than disrupt their outlines. For example, skunks, <b>salamanders</b> and monarch butterflies all have high-contrast patterns that display their outlines.|$|E
5|$|In frogs, the {{hind legs}} {{are larger than}} the fore legs, {{especially}} so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most <b>salamanders,</b> the limbs are short and {{more or less the}} same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish. Some <b>salamanders</b> in the genus Aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails. In aquatic <b>salamanders</b> and in frog tadpoles, the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.|$|E
5|$|In newts and <b>salamanders,</b> {{metamorphosis}} is {{less dramatic}} than in frogs. This {{is because the}} larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems. Their lungs are functional early, but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles. Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water. Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure. <b>Salamanders</b> are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land. Adult <b>salamanders</b> often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, thyroxine. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.|$|E

50|$|Several {{other species}} of <b>salamander</b> occupy the same range as the Cumberland dusky <b>salamander</b> and it is {{believed}} to hybridize with the Allegheny Mountain dusky <b>salamander</b> (Desmognathus ochrophaeus) and the Ocoee <b>Salamander</b> (Desmognathus ocoee).|$|R
5|$|Many {{amphibians}} are nocturnal {{and hide}} during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight. Other amphibians use camouflage {{to avoid being}} detected. They have various colourings such as mottled browns, greys and olives to blend into the background. Some <b>salamanders</b> adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda). Their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which {{makes it difficult for}} the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands. A few <b>salamanders</b> will autotomise their tails when attacked, sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape. The tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached. The tail is regenerated later, but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant.|$|E
5|$|Many {{woodland}} <b>salamanders</b> lay {{clutches of}} eggs under dead logs or stones on land. The black mountain salamander (Desmognathus welteri) does this, the mother brooding {{the eggs and}} guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs. When fully developed, they break {{their way out of}} the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile <b>salamanders.</b> The male hellbender, a primitive salamander, excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there. The male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch, using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Using fossil evidence, {{there are}} three main {{theories}} for the origin of modern amphibians. One is that they evolved from dissorophoid temnospondyls. Another is that they evolved from lepospondyls, most likely the lysorophians. A third hypothesis is that caecilians descended from lepospondyls and frogs and <b>salamanders</b> evolved from dissorophoids.|$|E
50|$|The small-mouth <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma texanum) is {{a species}} of mole <b>salamander</b> found in the central United States, from the Great Lakes region in Michigan to Nebraska, south to Texas, and east to Tennessee, with a {{population}} in Canada, in Pelee, Ontario.
