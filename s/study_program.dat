5|$|The {{conservative}} {{tradition of}} the mosque, with its {{lack of attention to}} science, was shaken by Napoleon's invasion. A seminal innovation occurred with the introduction of printing presses to Egypt, finally enabling the curriculum to shift from oral lectures and memorization to instruction by text, though the mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930. Upon the withdrawal of the French, Muhammad Ali Pasha encouraged the establishment of secular learning, and history, math, and modern science were adopted into the curriculum. By 1872, under the direction of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, European philosophy was also added to the <b>study</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E

It has been noted for its unique approach to halacha, using non-halakhic and kabbalistic sources to solve halachic problems, and is still widely quoted to this day. Frumer also produced an anonymous pamphlet titled עיקרי דיני תפילה (Main Laws of Prayer), which was widely read in prewar Poland. At the second Siyum HaShas in Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin in June 1938, Frumer initiated the Mishnah Yomit worldwide daily <b>study</b> <b>program,</b> as a complement to the Daf Yomi daily Talmud <b>study</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to create a}} {{comprehensive}} first-year <b>studies</b> <b>program</b> that continues throughout the first semester of the freshmen year. This program incorporated both in-class and out-of-class activities to ease the transition to college and provided support for the developmental needs of traditional-aged freshmen students. This program was created after reviewing information from existing literature. The researcher focused on literature describing the transition to college, challenges for traditional-aged freshmen students, and how first year <b>studies</b> <b>programs</b> can assist with freshmen students' development. Informal interviews were conducted with professionals at institutions with an existing First-Year <b>Studies</b> <b>program</b> and with Ball State University students. These were used to discover opinions from both professionals and students regarding the first year of college. The researcher then identified variations of the First-Year <b>Studies</b> <b>programs</b> at three different institutions including the University of Notre Dame's First-Year <b>Studies</b> <b>Program,</b> the Freshmen <b>Studies</b> <b>Program</b> at New York's St. Francis College, and the Minnesota State University at Mankato's First-Year Experience program.

In addition, there is one Program and one Department not contained in a School, as well as various interdisciplinary programs. The College of Health Sciences was established in 2004, but no longer exists as a separate academic unit. On November 16, 2006, the UC Regents approved the establishment of the School of Law, with an expected opening in fall 2009. The School of Education was established by the Regents of the University of California in 2012. Supplementary education programs offer accelerated or community education in the form of Summer Session and UC Irvine Extension. Additionally, UCI's Campuswide Honors Program is implementing an independent <b>study</b> <b>program,</b> which will allow students to develop their own curriculum across Schools and graduate with their own self-created major.
