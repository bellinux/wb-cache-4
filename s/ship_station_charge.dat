40|$|In {{terms of}} {{electric}} ship energy requirement in navigation, the <b>ship</b> <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> location is especially important. In this paper, a multi-period <b>ship</b> <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> location optimization model is pro-posed to make location decision in overall, from initial possible station sites chosen to the capacity determination {{for the final}} location sites. In the first phase, {{from the perspective of}} external environment, find out all possible <b>ship</b> <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> candidate sites through the feasible analyze. In the second phase, taking the ship charging demands into consideration, the final <b>ship</b> <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> sites can be selected among the candidate sites based on backup coverage model. In the last phase, regarding the cost of construction and service capability for different grade as the main factor in capacity determination, the optimal capacity of each final <b>ship</b> <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> are determined by means of optimization method. Finally, an example of Yanqi lake in China is used to verify the validity of the proposed methodology. The reasonable location of <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> could ensure the electric energy supply and avoid congestion caused by ship charging gathering. The model can be easily generalized to other problems regarding facility allocation based on user demand...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Energy Engineering, İzmir, 2000 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 77 - 78) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishviii, 78 leavesThis study {{involves a}} photovoltaic <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> {{which could be}} placed on garage roofs in order {{to charge the battery}} of an electrical car. The aim of this thesis is to design an efficient photo voltaic <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> and construction of omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station.</b> That's why various models were designed and calculated amount of energy. A photovoltaic <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> has 16 photovoltaic modules with dimensions 1293 mm* 329 mm* 34 mm. In this study five different type of solar <b>charge</b> <b>stations</b> were compared. These are, omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> (first type), south facing type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> with different angles (second type), south facing type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> with fixed angles (third type), inverse of omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> (fourth type), optimisation of south facing type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> with different angles (fifth type). After calculating of collected solar energy, the fifth type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> was chosen as the most efficient solar <b>charge</b> <b>station.</b> After these theoretical calculations, omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> has been installed on the Electrical Engineering Department's roof.
