500|$|... "Our Father" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; some {{thought that it}} was dull, though Smits' performance received widespread critical acclaim. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that he was [...] "frustrated" [...] by the episode despite not finding any faults with it, writing, [...] "I can't help thinking that I've seen as much of Dexter Morgan's world as I need to." [...] Matt Fowler, writing for IGN, thought that the revelation of Rita's pregnancy was [...] "an interesting development, but not necessarily something that instantly catapults me to the edge of my seat" [...] but that Smits as Miguel could improve [...] "even [...] great [...] like Dexter". The Australians Stephen Romei felt that, with the beginning of the third season, [...] "Dexter has gone from an eight to a six" [...] on a <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> ten, saying that the show [...] "has lost its edge" [...] with the hypocrisy of Dexter being a supposed sociopath despite holding several relationships. Los Angeles Times critic Claire Zulkey was [...] "not sure yet whether [...] good". Ray Ellis of Blogcritics felt that [...] "the series has settled into a state of complacency" [...] and could not [...] "escape the feeling I've seen this before". On the other hand, the San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman wrote that [...] "the whiff of normalcy for Dexter" [...] gives viewers [...] "a magnificent tease" [...] and likened the fast-moving plot to [...] "the urgency of brilliance". TV Squad critic Debra McDuffee was [...] "pleasantly surprised by Smits" [...] and said that, thus far, [...] "season three is a good one". TV Guides Paula Paige, who was [...] "thrilled" [...] to see Smits join the cast, said, [...] "What the Dexter season three opener lacked in explosive excitement, it certainly made up for in Jimmy Smits." [...] Daniel Fienberg, writing for Zap2it, said that the combination of Hall and Smits was [...] "as good as TV acting gets" [...] and that, in comparison to the second season's opening, [...] "the show's creative team appears to have done it again".|$|E
500|$|Mercedes {{featured}} {{in three of}} the episode's musical numbers. Flandez said of her solo, [...] "She blew Jennifer Hudson's 'Spotlight' out of this world." [...] Benigno wrote that it was [...] "great", but added that it was [...] "not much of a stretch for Amber Riley to hit this one". Berk praised her [...] "amazing voice" [...] and gave the performance four stars out of five, and Goldberg characterized the rendition as [...] "flawless". Other reviewers were more critical, including VanDerWerff, who said that this was the only song in the episode that [...] "really didn't work". Slezak felt that the arrangement used was not distinct enough from the original, though he gave the performance a [...] "B+", as did West, who wrote, [...] "Mercedes looked fantastic and carried herself well, and her voice was as strong as ever but it felt a little lacking." [...] In her [...] "Maria-off" [...] with Rachel, Benigno said they [...] "both kill it", characterized it as [...] "easy but fun", and gave it an [...] "A−", as did Slezak and West, the latter of whom [...] "didn't feel that Mercedes was the clear winner" [...] but thought both singers were [...] "fantastic". Kubicek thought that [...] "Mercedes clearly won" [...] and Flandez maintained that she [...] "clearly outshone her rival", and continued, [...] "You just believe so much of what she sings." [...] Berk agreed, and contrasted the two singers with his rating <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> five stars: [...] "Two stars for Rachel, who sang this like Barry Manilow; four for Mercedes, who sang this like she lived it." [...] Futterman had a slightly different take: [...] "Rachel puts on a diva front, but inside she's scared and nervous, while Mercedes is just a diva." [...] However, Hyman thought that the two [...] "were evenly matched", while Canning and Billboard Rae Votta both thought Rachel was the victor; Votta stated, [...] "While the show wants us to believe otherwise, Rachel clearly outsang Mercedes". [...] "It's All Over" [...] from Dreamgirls received the most enthusiastic commentary, including an [...] "A+" [...] from West, who wrote [...] "Mercedes was at her best in this performance", a sentiment echoed by Benigno when he awarded the song an [...] "A". Hyman called it [...] "pretty awesome" [...] and Flandez a [...] "cleverly amusing take", while Futterman said Mercedes [...] "fully embraces her inner Effie White" [...] and that the song was [...] "on par with the best of Glee's Broadway songs in terms of plot relevancy and vocal arrangements". She also praised [...] "the first group showtune the New Directions have done" [...] and added, [...] "we want more". Votta characterized it as [...] "a flawless fantasy homage" [...] and stated, [...] "It's the perfect use of the non-realism of [...] "Glee" [...] and the power of musical theater to express a storyline". Kubicek agreed it was [...] "like a real musical" [...] in these regards and praised Mike's short solo, and West liked the segment where Santana confronts Mercedes in the number. Slezak was not enthusiastic about the rendition, and wrote that he wished that the [...] "scene gelled better than it did", and questioned why Mercedes was the character Effie while all the other members of New Directions were themselves. He gave the number a [...] "C+".|$|E

One psychiatrist called Barefoot a [...] "criminal sociopath" [...] and said there was no treatment for this condition and that Barefoot was likely to commit acts of violence in the future. The other psychiatrist testified that Barefoot had [...] "a fairly classical, typical, sociopathic personality disorder." [...] He placed Barefoot in the [...] "most severe category" [...] of sociopaths, and on a <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> ten, Barefoot was [...] "above ten".

40|$|The {{observed}} {{matter in}} the universe accounts for just 5 % of the observed gravity. A {{possible explanation is that}} Newton’s and Einstein’s theories of gravity fail where gravity is either weak or enhanced. The modified theory of Newtonian dynamics (MOND) reproduces, without dark matter, spiral-galaxy orbital motions and the relation between luminosity and rotation in galaxies, although not in clusters. Recent extensions of Einstein’s theory are theoretically more complete. They inevitably include dark fields that seed structure growth, and they may explain recent weak lensing data. However, the presence of dark fields reduces calculability and comes {{at the expense of the}} original MOND premise, that the matter we see is the sole source of gravity. Observational tests of the relic radiation, weak lensing, and the growth of structure may distinguish modified gravity from dark matter. Theproblem of missingmass has been withus for more than 70 years: Given theamount of directly observable matter, general relativity (GR, Einstein’s theory of gravity) produces too little gravity to account for a host <b>of</b> observations.

40|$|Gut {{fluorescence}} {{analysis of}} Calanus paczjkus and Metridia pacijica {{is used to}} describe variation in food intake rate at time <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> several hours. The animals are starved before each experiment, then exposed continuously to phytoplankton cultures. Variability of gut fullness is large (order IO-fold) between individual copepods captured {{at the same time}} and is about proportional to the within-time-period average. The gut fullness curve shows a strong initial peak l- 2 h after food is supplied and drops to about 20 % of the peak level after 7 - 9 h of exposure to high food levels. For Calanus gut fullness and swimming activity at the time of capture are strongly correlated. Active animals have on average 2 - 5 times as much pigment in their guts as inactive animals captured at the same time. However, inactive animals resume swimming and feeding activity in l- 3 h. The changes in gut fullness appear to involve episodic on-off switching of feeding activity as well as regulation of maximum instantaneous feeding rate and of either or both satiation and hunger thresholds. The feeding rate of herbivorous copepods is not uniform with time. Twenty-four-hour periodicities have been demonstrated fo...|$|R
