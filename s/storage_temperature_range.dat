The paper discussed the operating conditions with changing the combination of systems and storage temperature difference, and found that the heat storage time of the tank is great different from the solar radiation time.

40|$|The {{residual}} styrene {{and other}} {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) present in the polystyrene food packaging are of concern as these compounds {{have the potential to}} migrate into the food in contact. This work describes a method for quantitative determination of VOCs, namely styrene, toluene, ethylbenzene, iso-propylbenzene and n-propylbenzene that have migrated from polystyrene food packaging into food simulant by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique was applied for migration test using water as food simulant. The effects of extraction variables including sample volume, elutropic strength, extraction temperature, extraction time, desorption time, sample agitation, and salt addition on the amounts of the extracted analytes were studied to obtain the optimal HS-SPME conditions. The optimized method was applied to test the VOCs migrated from polystyrene bowls and cups at <b>storage</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>ranging</b> from 24 °C to 80 °C for 30 min. Styrene and ethylbenzene were found to migrate from the samples into the food simulant.

40|$|Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) {{content is}} internationally {{recognized}} {{for its ability}} to indicate the freshness or lack of freshness of honey. Relevant standards stipulate that commercial honey intended for household consumption should have no more than 40 mg of HMF per kilogram of honey. This study investigated the correlation between changes in HMF content and changes in other quality criteria such as moisture content, conductivity, and total acidity when honey was subject to temperatures characteristic of the stages prior to industrial pasteurization. Furthermore, a model was created to predict increases in HMF content in the above stages. The study involved four different types of honey. Several thermal treatments were applied by combining different temperatures (between 35 8 C and 65 8 C) with periods of time ranging from 3 h to 28 days. Multivariate analysis showed no correlation between HMF content and the other three study variables. The application of a general linear model confirmed that the increases observed in HMF content were only correlated with time, temperature, and type of honey. The model created accounted for 75. 47 % of data variability and it is concluded that the predictive power of the model could be improved by modeling the <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>ranges</b> apart from the liquefaction <b>temperature</b> <b>ranges.</b> Key Words: honey, thermal treatments, hydroxymethylfurfura...|$|R

Samples were stored under laboratory conditions at different temperatures: 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C and sensory analysed every week during one month storage. The dry matter (d. m.) was measured, too. Descriptors of general appearance, sausage casing, texture, cut surface, dry edge, smell, taste, and salty were monitored. Biggest changes were in descriptors general appearance and sausage casing (P < 0. 001) and also in dry edge (P < 0. 010) during the month period. Germs of moulds were found only at 5 and 10 °C. Rapid increase of d. m. in samples was noticeable {{in the first week}} of the storage time. It was 3 % d. m. at 5 °C and 11 % d. m. at 25 °C.

Mature fruits were harvested from 24 plants belonging to the palm collection of the Instituto Agronômico (IAC) located at Ubatuba, São Paulo State, Brazil, and taken in moisture-proof containers to the Universidade Estadual de São Paulo, in Botucatu, São Paulo State. Half of the fruits were shelled and the seeds stored, with and without pulp, in sealed plastic bags (20 µm thick) maintained in chambers with temperatures of 5; 10; 15 and 20 - 30 ºC. Samples for the quality tests were taken at 0; 3; 6; 9 and 12 days after fruit harvest. Seeds stored with pulp were immediately shelled before test installation. Several characteristics were evaluated, especially seed water content, germination rate, seedling length and dry matter. There is a positive after-ripening effect on Euterpe edulis seeds. A period of storage of 9 to 12 days, after fruit harvest and before sowing, favored germination and vigor of jussara seeds. These effects were higher in shelled seeds when compared to unshelled ones. Short-term <b>storage</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>ranging</b> from 5 to 20 - 30 ºC are equally adequate {{for the preservation of}} seeds without pulp, but should not exceed 20 ºC for those with pulp, since a decrease in germination and vigor, and an increase in rotted germinative button and dead seeds were observed at 20 - 30 ºC temperature...|$|R
40|$|Numerous changes {{occur in}} frankfurters during {{processing}} and storage. Reaction kinetics depends on various {{factors such as}} composition, temperature and packaging. Physico-chemical, microbiological and textural changes were analysed in two commercial formulations of frankfurters during their storage at 5, 10 and 15 C. This information allowed to calculate kinetics parameters and to predict shelf life at the usual <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range.</b> The formulation with higher content of meat protein was more resistant and elastic and had lower purge loss. The variability within each lot was higher than the effect of storage time and temperature on texture parameters, so these parameters would not be sensitive enough to detect changes and predict frankfurters shelf life. At 5 C, pH, acidity and purge loss remained constant with storage time while at 10 and 15 C good linear correlations (r> 0. 958) were found. Microbiological growth fitted a logarithmic equation (r> 0. 978). Physico-chemical changes followed a zero-order reaction while microbiological growth followed a first-order one. All reaction rate constants increasedwith temperature. Changes in pH, acidity and purge loss were higher for the formulation with higher starch and lower meat protein content.

40|$|AbstractSolar thermal {{electricity}} generation is taking up increasing proportions of future power generation worldwide. Recent {{research indicates that}} a closed-loop Brayton cycle using supercritical carbon dioxide (s-CO 2) offers the potential of higher power cycle efficiency versus the conventional superheated steam cycle at temperatures relevant for CSP applications. Thermal energy storage solves the time mismatch between the solar energy supply and the electricity peak demand and allows for a more efficient use of the turbine and other power block components. The narrow <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> required for the s-CO 2 cycle advantages the use of latent heat storage, which has a higher storage density compared to the conventional two-tank storage. This paper demonstrates a design of a cascaded shell and tube phase change storage system potentially applicable for the s-CO 2 cycle. A previously developed effectiveness-number of transfer unit method is employed as a design guide and computational fluid dynamics modelling is performed to examine the sensible energy extraction. The results prove that {{the effectiveness of the}} extracted sensible energy can be increased by increasing the number of phase change storage systems in series. Stainless steel (SS) AISI 316 as well as a creep resistant SS AISI 446 is considered as the tube material in the design and results suggest that using AISI 446 can minimize the overall amount of storage and tube materials...|$|E

For a series of binary M 2 + Al 3 + LDOs, the influence of six divalent cations (Ca, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, and Mg) on the NO x adsorption capacity, NO oxidation property, and the thermal stability of adsorbed NO x was systematically investigated. The optimal NO x <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> for each binary LDO was also determined. Based on the fundamental findings of binary LDOs, a ternary LDH CoMgAl-CO 3 derived LDO CoMgAlO x with a significantly improved NO x storage capacity was designed.

40|$|Temperature has {{critical}} {{impact on}} food quality and safety within food supply chain, therefore, food {{should be kept}} at the defined <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range.</b> Final consumer should be assured when buying food about actual temperature and thermal history of the selected food product {{and this is why}} it should be indicated on the packed or prepacked item. The chromogenic temperature indicator for cold food chain was prepared from suitable active material packed in the properly structured holder. When temperature rises above the defined storage temperature, the active material changes colour and physical state (solid/liquid). Simultaneously, special packaging structure enables irreversible recording of the time exposed to the elevated temperature. The active material was made of thermochromic composite, consisting of dye, developer and solvent. It changes colour at its melting point, being coloured below and discoloured above it. The temperature is called activation temperature of the composite. Its value was adjusted by appropriate solvent and additives used for preparation of the composite, to reach the desired value. The temperature dependent colour change of the composite was determined by colorimetric measurements. The conditions for best observation of the change by naked eye were also examined. The structure of the active material’s holder was analyzed for best displaying of the time spend at high temperature (above the activation temperature). Functioning of the indicator was examined with growth of pathogens as a function of migration of the active material at temperature above the required storage temperature of the food. It was found out that the described chromogenic temperature indicator for cold food chain shows the thermal history of food storage by colour-, phase- and migration changes of the active composite material and consequently would be reliable as indicator in cold food chain to indicate temperature abuse and would disclose potential growth of psychrophilic microorganisms...|$|E

Cold storage of raw milk promotes the thriving of psychrotrophic/psychrotolerant bacteria, which are well known for their ability to produce enzymes that are frequently heat stable. However, these bacteria also carry antibiotic resistance (AR) features. In places, where no cold chain facilities are available and despite existing recommendations numerous adulterants, including antibiotics, are added to raw milk. Previously, N 2 gas flushing showed real potential for hindering bacterial growth in raw milk at a <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>ranging</b> from 6 to 25 ◦C. Here, the ability of N 2 gas (N) to tackle antibioticresistant bacteria was tested and compared to that of the activated lactoperoxidase system (HT) for three raw milk samples that were stored at 6 ◦C for 7 days. To that end, the mesophiles and psychrotrophs that were resistant to gentamycin (G), ceftazidime (Ce), levofloxacin (L), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS) were enumerated. For the log 10 ratio (which is defined as the bacterial counts from a certain condition divided by the counts on the corresponding control), classical Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) was performed, followed by a mean comparison with the Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welsch multiple range test (REGWQ). If the storage “time” factor was the major determinant of the recorded effects, cold storage alone or in combination with HT or with N promoted a sample-dependent response in consideration of the AR levels. The efficiency of N in limiting the increase in AR was highest for fresh raw milk and was judged to be equivalent to that of HT for one sample and superior to that of HT for the two other samples; moreover, compared to HT, N seemed to favor a more diverse community at 6 ◦C that was less heavily loaded with antibiotic multi-resistance features. Our results imply that N 2 gas flushing could strengthen cold storage of raw milk by tackling the bacterial spoilage potential while simultaneously hindering the increase of bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance/multi-resistance features...|$|R

40|$|Antistaling {{properties}} of enzymes (xylanase, bacterial maltogenic and conventional a-amylases), CMC and {{vital wheat gluten}} on corn tortillas were evaluated during storage for up to 21 days. Effect of storage time (0 - 21 days) and temperature (- 40, - 20, 3, 10 and 21 oC) on tortilla staling was evaluated with or without additives. Addition of 275 - 1650 AU of ICS maltogenic amylase effectively reduced amylopectin retrogradation without reducing tortilla yields, but did not improve tortilla flexibility. The combination of 825 AU of ICS amylase (to interfere with intra-granular amylopectin re-crystallization) and 0. 25 % CMC (to create a more flexible inter-granular matrix than retrograded amylose) produced less stiff, equally flexible and less chewy tortillas than 0. 5 % CMC. Corn tortilla staling followed the basic laws that control aging in starch-based semi-crystalline systems such as starch gels, bread and other baked products. Amylopectin re-crystallization was {{the driving force behind}} the staling of corn tortillas. Increasing levels of re-crystallized amylopectin measured by DSC correlated significantly with increased tortilla stiffness and reduction in tortilla rollability, pliability and rupture distance during storage. Re-crystallization of amylopectin in fresh tortillas was not detected. It increased rapidly during the first 24 hr reaching a plateau after 7 days storage. The level of amylopectin re-crystallization on tortillas showed a bell-shaped trend along the evaluated <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> with a maximum around 7 oC. However, a negative linear relationship of peak pasting viscosity with storage temperature of tortilla extracts without additives after 21 days suggests other compounds besides amylopectin affect tortilla staling. Thus, interfering with amylopectin re-crystallization is not the only way to retard staling. Further research is required to optimize the addition of maltogenic amylases in continuous processing lines that use fresh masa instead of nixtamalized corn flour, to determine how these amylases interfere with amylopectin re-crystallization and to elucidate if amylose retrogradation continues during storage and plays a role in tortilla staling...|$|E

By using this experiment, the material data, important for heat <b>storage</b> in the <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> between 200 " 0 C and 400 " 0 C, were determined. In addition, storage characteristics of the modules were tested and experiments on the temperature resistance were conducted. The instrumentation of the measuring points was installed in the data acquisition system 'MSR-Manager', and further control programs were created to regulate the thermal oil massflow through the storage modules and check the automatic operation of the arrangement.

40|$|The {{influence}} of thermal processing on droplet flocculation in oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by either beta-lactoglobulin (primary emulsions) or beta-lactoglobulin-iota-carrageenan (secondary emulsions) at pH 6 has been investigated. In {{the absence of}} salt, the zeta-potential of the primary emulsion was less negative (- 40 mV) {{than that of the}} secondary emulsion (- 55 mV) due to adsorption of anionic iota-carrageenan to the anionic beta-Lg-coated droplet surfaces. The zeta-potential and mean diameter (d(43) approximately 0. 3 microm) of droplets in primary and secondary emulsions did not change after <b>storage</b> at <b>temperatures</b> <b>ranging</b> from 30 to 90 degrees C. In the presence of 150 mM NaCl, the zeta-potential of the primary emulsion was much less negative (- 27 mV) than that of the secondary emulsion (- 50 mV), suggesting that the latter was less influenced by electrostatic screening effects. The zeta-potential of the primary emulsions did not change after <b>storage</b> at elevated <b>temperatures</b> (30 - 90 degrees C). The zeta-potential of the secondary emulsions became less negative, and the aqueous phase iota-carrageenan concentration increased at <b>storage</b> <b>temperatures</b> exceeding 50 degrees C, indicating iota-carrageenan desorbed from the beta-Lg-coated droplets. In the primary emulsions, appreciable droplet flocculation (d(43) approximately 8 microm) occurred at temperatures below the thermal denaturation temperature (T(m)) of the adsorbed proteins due to surface denaturation, while more extensive flocculation (d(43) 3 ̆e 20 microm) occurred above T(m) due to thermal denaturation. In the secondary emulsions, the extent of droplet flocculation below T(m) was reduced substantially (d(43) approximately 0. 8 microm), which was attributed to the ability of adsorbed carrageenan to increase droplet-droplet repulsion. However, extensive droplet flocculation was observed above T(m) because carrageenan desorbed from the droplet surfaces. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that iota-carrageenan and beta-Lg interacted strongly in aqueous solutions containing 0 mM NaCl, but not in those containing 150 mM NaCl, presumably because salt weakened the electrostatic attraction between the molecules...|$|R
40|$|An {{infectious}} pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) {{belonging to}} the Sp serotype, isolated from scallops Pecten maximus, was propagated and suspended in sterile water and cell culture medium with different salinities and incubated at <b>temperatures</b> <b>ranging</b> from - 80 to 40 degrees C. Virus stability was examined by measuring virus titers under different storage conditions. Virus titers were also measured after repeated freezing and thawing, and in incubated sterile filtered scallop hepatopancreas, haemolymph and crystalline style samples, and salmon Salmo salar kidney homogenate. The virus was stable under most <b>storage</b> conditions. <b>Temperatures</b> <b>ranging</b> from - 80 to + 20 degrees C, as well as salinities from 0 to 40 parts per thousand, {{did not seem to}} influence the stability of the virus. A reduction was observed above 20 degrees C. Each freezing and thawing procedure resulted in a reduction of the virus titer. This reduction was larger at - 80 than at - 20 degrees C. The IPNV persisted for a long period in sterile filtered scallop haemolymph, dissolved crystalline style and hepatopancreas. In kidney homogenate from IPNV-infected salmon the virus titers were reduced at least 10 -fold during the first day of incubation at all temperatures tested. When virus was propagated in cell culture and subsequently mixed with non-infected salmon kidney homogenate, the virus proved more persistent. Our results illustrate the importance of rapid and standardised laboratory processing of potentially virus-containing tissue samples, and are relevant when considering laboratory storage of samples containing IPNV...|$|R

40|$|Exposure to {{bacterial}} endotoxin {{has been recognized}} {{to be associated with}} various airway inflammation and allergic responses. However, concentrations of airborne endotoxin in the Pearl River Delta Region (PRDR) have not previously been well characterized. Conventional determination of endotoxin concentrations with Limilus Ambocyte Lysate assay suffers from the limitations of significant intra- and inter-laboratory variations in the measured endotoxin levels. A biomarker approach thereby has been proposed as an alternative chemical approach to quantify the level of the total airborne endotoxin. However, the stability of using 3 -hydroxy fatty acids (3 -OH FAs) as biomarkers for the quantification of airborne endotoxin levels needs to be addressed before this biomarker approach can be applied for the routine measurement of airborne endotoxin levels. In this research, we investigated the stability of 3 -OH FAs under different storage and sampling conditions. The results showed that 3 -OH FAs were stable at the <b>storage</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>ranged</b> from - 80 °C to 4 °C and can be stored up to 6 months at - 20 °C without significant degradation. 3 -OH FAs were also highly stable with respect to the sampling <b>temperatures</b> <b>ranged</b> from 15 °C to 45 °C and the sampling RH ranged from 30 % to 90 %. However, endotoxins collected at the flow rates of 16. 67 L/min and 7. 33 L/min resulted in 2. 2 -fold and 3. 6 -fold higher concentrations than those collected at 1. 13 m 3 /min, respectively. This observation suggests that aerosol samples collected at lower flow rate may lead to overestimated endotoxin levels as a result of bacterial growth during sampling. The high stability of 3 -OH FAs adds the advantage of using this biomarker approach for the quantification of airborne endotoxin concentrations in PRDR. Aerosol samples were collected during a one year period from March 2008 to February 2009 in three PRD cities (Guangzhou (GZ), Nansha (NS), and Hong Kong (HK)). The geometric means of endotoxin concentrations in GZ, NS, and HK were 22. 32, 16. 00 and 13. 82 ng/m 3, respectively. Furthermore, lower endotoxin levels were observed in summer in the three cities. This was negatively correlated significantly to the ambient temperature as well as relative humidity in Nansha and Hong Kong. Majority of the endotoxins was associated with the PM 2. 5 or fine particulates in all three cities (GZ: 84 %; NS: 70 %; HK: 86 %) suggesting the ambient endotoxin can potentially deposit deep in human respiratory system. The high occurrence (about 30 %) of the odd carbon chain 3 -OH FAs in the total endotoxin suggests some source specific bacterial fauna in the region and deserves further investigations. With the high measured endotoxin levels in PRDR, it may possibly pose a chronic health hazard to human...|$|R

However, at present the development of thermochemical storage technology is in its initial stage with investigations mainly on material aspects or small lab-scale systems. With regard to its thermodynamics and kinetics, {{it has been shown that}} the CaO/Ca(OH) 2 reaction system is suitable for thermochemical heat <b>storage</b> at a <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> of 400 – 600 C. However, the behaviour in a small lab-scale system was mainly dominated by heat and mass transfer limitations originating from the small particle size and changes in the bulk properties. It is shown that by the addition of small amounts of additives like nano- particles of SiO 2 (Aerosil), the bulk properties can be stabilized and consequently the cycling stability ensured. In addition, channelling effects can be minimized resulting in a more homogeneous flow through the reaction bed improving the overall reaction behaviour of the thermochemical storage...|$|R
