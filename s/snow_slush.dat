Spatial and {{temporal}} variations in aerodynamic roughness length (z 0) on Haut Glacier d’Arolla, Switzerland, during the 1993 and 1994 ablation seasons are described, based on measure-ments of surface microtopography. The {{validity of the}} microtopographic z 0 measurements is established through comparison with independent vertical wind profile z 0 measurements over melting <b>snow,</b> <b>slush</b> and ice. The z 0 variations are explained through correlation and regression analyses, using independent measurements of meteorological and surface variables, and parameterizations are developed to calculate z 0 variations for use in surface energy balance melt models. Several independent variables successfully explain snow z 0 variation through their correlation with increasing surface roughness, caused by ablation hollow formation, during snow melt. Non-linear parameterizations based on either accumulated melt or accumulated daily maximum temperatures since the most recent snowfall explain over 80 % of snow z 0 variation. The z 0 following a fresh snowfall on an ice surface is parameterized based on relationships with the underlying ice z 0, snow depth and accumulated daily maximum temperatures.

Cells fixed on membrane filters were hybridized with a probe specific for the domain Bacteria {{as well as with}} probes for the alpha, beta, and gamma subclasses of the class Proteobacteria and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group. The fraction of bacteria detectable after hybridization with the bacterial probe EUB ranged from 40 to 81 % of 4 (prm 1), 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) counts. The bacterial assemblage varied considerably between and within different habitats (<b>snow,</b> <b>slush,</b> and lake water) but was in most cases dominated by members of the beta subclass (6. 5 to 116 % of bacteria detectable with probe EUB).

Palmer. A primary objective was {{to build on the}} work of previous Antarctic drift station experiments to geophysically characterize sea ice in terms of thickness, surface and ice bottom morphology, and ultimately area-unitized mass. A 24 day drift station was established at approximately 70 °S and 93 °W in mixed first-year and multi-year ice with three geophysical study sites selected on a 5 km 2 floe. A comprehensive time series assessment of elevation-surveyed transects ranging from 100 m to 300 m in length included snow surface elevation, snow depth, electromagnetic (EM) profiling, and direct drilling for ice draft and ice freeboard. Additional work included a snow surface morphology characterization of a 100 m x 300 m area between the primary time series EM transects. Correlation of EM ice thicknesses with collocated drilled ice thickness yielded equations for the correction of EM underestimation of thick deformed ice, particularly at pressure ridges. Mean ice thickness from corrected EM was compared to isostatic ice thickness calculated from surface elevation, snow depth, ice freeboard and respective <b>snow,</b> <b>slush,</b> ice, and sea water densities. Results were consistent, with mean ice thicknesses for multi-year ice of 2. 35 m, 2. 34 m, and 2. 41 m, with similar variance, for corrected EM, drilling, and buoyancy methods respectively. Additionally, a mean ice thickness of 2. 31 m was calculated from ASPeCt observations of the ice field associated with the floe, using the method incorporating mean sail heights and fractional coverage of surface deformities or ridging. Temporal series assessment of ice freeboard indicated a slightly negative mean ice freeboard (< 0. 04 m), with clear evidence of new snow-ice formation from the freezing of slush. The three distinct snow and ice regions assessed on the Belgica floe had mean corrected EM ice thickness of 0. 52 +/- 0. 04 m (+/- 1 std. deviation), 0. 92 +/- 0. 17 m, and 2. 35 +/- 1. 37 m, and mean snow depths of 0. 08 +/- 0. 03 m, 0. 36 +/- 0. 09 m, and 0. 68 +/- 0. 31 m respectively. Each ice type represented a sizable fraction of the floe's total area (similar to 20 %, 40 %, and 40 % respectively from visual estimates) reflecting a complex dynamic and thermodynamic history of formation, as well as the difficulty in characterizing even a single floe by a single class or mean value for thickness and snow depth.
