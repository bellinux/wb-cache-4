40|$|Objective: The goal of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} list of <b>forenames</b> <b>and</b> <b>surnames</b> of South Asian (SA) women {{that could be used to}} {{identify}} SA breast cancer patients within the cancer registry. This list was compiled, evaluated, and validated to ensure comprehensiveness, accuracy, and applicability of SA names. Methods: This project was conducted by Canadian researchers who are immersed in conducting behavioral studies with SA women diagnosed with cancer in the province of British Columbia. Recruiting SA cancer patients for research can be a difficult task due to social and cultural factors. Methods used by other researchers to identify ethnicity related unique names were employed to filter <b>surnames</b> <b>and</b> <b>forenames</b> that were not common to this ethnic group. Co-author (Gurpreet Oshan) of SA ethnicity rigorously identified and deleted multiple lists and redundant entries along with common English forenames which resulted in a list of 16, 888 SA forenames. All co-authors of Indian ethnicity (Gurpreet Oshan, Savitri Singh-Carlson, Harajit Lail) were involved in critiquing and manually reviewing the names list throughout this process. Comprehensive lists of SA <b>surnames</b> <b>and</b> women′s <b>forenames</b> were reviewed to identify those that were unique to SA ethnicity. Accuracy was ensured by constantly filtering the redundancy by using an Excel program which helped to illustrate the number of times each name was spelled in different ways. Results: The final lists included 9112 <b>surnames</b> <b>and</b> 16, 888 <b>forenames</b> of SA ethnicity. On the basis of the surname linkage only, the sensitivity of the list was 76. 6 %, specificity was 62. 9 %, and the positive predictive value was 58. 5 %. On the basis of both the <b>surname</b> <b>and</b> <b>forename</b> linkage, the specificity of the list was 88. 6 %. These lists include variations in spelling <b>forenames</b> <b>and</b> <b>surnames</b> as well. Conclusions: The list of <b>surnames</b> <b>and</b> <b>forenames</b> can be useful tools to identify SA ethnic groups from large population database in healthcare-related research. Ethnicity-specific population research is important in order to help identify how cancer care should be delivered for the SA population, as well as for planning and provision of other related health services. We are willing to share this list upon request to the authors...|$|R

40|$|Generally {{surnames}} (family name) or forenames are {{evolved over}} generations {{which can be}} used to understand population origins, migration, identity, social norms and cultural customs. These forenames or surnames may have hidden structure associated with them called communities. Each community might have strong correlation among several <b>forenames</b> <b>and</b> <b>surnames.</b> In addition, the correlation might be across communities of forenames or surnames. Popular statistical generative model such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has been developed to find topics in a corpus of documents. However, the LDA model can be proposed to identify hidden communities in names data set. This paper proposes several variants of latent Dirichlet allocation models to capture correlation between <b>surnames</b> <b>and</b> <b>forenames</b> within the communities and across the communities over a set of names collected at different locations. Initially, we propose surname correlated LDA model <b>and</b> <b>forename</b> correlated LDA model. These models identify communities in <b>surnames</b> or <b>forenames</b> <b>and</b> extract corresponding correlated forenames or surnames in each community respectively. Later, we propose surname community correlated LDA model <b>and</b> <b>forename</b> community correlated LDA model. These models estimate correlation among each surname community to the communities of <b>forenames</b> <b>and</b> vice versa respectively. We experiment for India and United Kingdom names data sets and conclusions are drawn...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} an exploratory {{analysis of the}} significance of personal names in contemporary Western societies, the UK in particular. Names are seen as hav-ing the dual character of denoting the individuality of the person, and also mark-ing social connections. The focus is particularly on kinship, {{and the ways in which}} names can be, and are, used to map family connections as well as to identify unique individuals. The author argues that both <b>surnames</b> <b>and</b> <b>forenames</b> can serve to ground the individual within family relationships, though the extent to which this is used actively can vary. In turn the way in which names and naming are used within the family context sheds light upon contemporary kinship, with its enduring and variable dimensions. Additional empirical exploration of names and naming could further illuminate its characteristics...|$|R

Complete and validate the Westminster Historical Database by including all extant poll book records together with selected rate book records for Westminster between 1749 and 1820; 2. Design and execute experiments on the practice of record linkage using historical sources; 3. Document the Westminster Historical Database and prepare a guide to its effective use; 4. Research and publish on voting behaviour and social structure in a pre-reform mass electorate; 5. Research and publish {{on the theme of}} continuity and change in the economy of Westminster between 1749 and 1820. Main Topics : The right of voting in Westminster constituency lay in adult male rate paying householders, and thousands of them participated in each of the 12 elections between 1749 and 1820. The database contains individual-level data on pre-reform electoral behaviour for the constituency between 1749 and 1820, and consists of 23 two-way tables in standard relational format. Of these, 12 are electronic editions of the surviving Westminster Poll Books for the years between 1749 and 1820, enhanced through the addition of supplementary name and occupational codes. A further 9 tables are versions of selected Westminster Parish Rate Books which compliment the Poll Book tables and which, through record linkage, enable a much fuller representation to be made of Westminster's voters, their social standing and political preferences. The remaining two tables contain coding schema for names and occupations respectively. Each poll book record contains data on the <b>surname</b> <b>and</b> <b>forename</b> of the voter, his parish and street of residence, his occupation, his vote, and additional name and occupational codes. Each rate book record consists of the <b>surname</b> <b>and</b> <b>forename</b> of the householder, together with the parish, ward and street within which the property lay, its rack rental assessment, and additional name and occupational codes...|$|R

The toponyms [...] "Croche" [...] and Crooked is widespread in the places names in Quebec, including 102 lakes that are so designated. Given that many rivers used the word «Croche» in their names, the authorities replaced some of them with more distinctive names.

50|$|There {{are several}} prefixes and suffixes that may {{indicate}} whether a modern surname originated from a patronym: the English suffixes -son, and -s; and the Gaelic prefix Mac-. In some cases, the -son was dropped from such <b>surnames,</b> <b>and</b> just the <b>forename</b> of an ancestor was used (for example Martin). In some cases, the suffix -s was used, {{and according to}} Black, such names appear to have originated in England (for example Adams).|$|R

We measure simultaneously the effects of place of residence (privileged or underprivileged city), of nationality (French or Moroccan), and of sound of <b>surname</b> <b>and</b> of <b>forename</b> (French or Arab), on the chances of obtaining a job interview when answering a job ad. We base our assessment on a controlled experiment conducted on the profession of waiter. We constructed 16 jobseeker profiles and sent 938 resumes in reply to 118 job vacancies advertised at the end of 2006. We obtain two results. First, there is evidence of a significant effect against the candidates with an Arab origin; second, there is evidence of residential discrimination against the candidates that are either the most qualified or of French origin. Overall, discrimination would tend to level down the employment opportunities of the candidates in underprivileged suburbs by putting at a disadvantage the candidates that are usually the most favored...|$|R
40|$|Names, as proper nouns, {{are clearly}} {{important}} for the identification of individuals in everyday life. In the present article, I argue that <b>forenames</b> <b>and</b> <b>surnames</b> need also {{to be recognized as}} “doing” words, important in the categorization of sex at birth and in the ongoing management of gender conduct appropriate to sex category. Using evidence on personal naming practices in the United States and United Kingdom, I examine what happens at crisis points of sexed and gendered naming in the life course (for example, at the birth of babies, at marriage, and during gender-identity transitions). I show how <b>forenames</b> <b>and</b> <b>surnames</b> help in the embodied doing of gender and, likewise, that bodies are key to gendered practices of <b>forenaming</b> <b>and</b> surnaming: we have “gendered embodied named identities. ” Whether normative and compliant, pragmatic, or creative <b>and</b> resistant, <b>forenaming</b> <b>and</b> <b>surnaming</b> practices are revealed as core to the production and reproduction of binary sex categories and to gendered identities, difference, hierarchies, and inequalities.

40|$|IT is {{generally}} accepted that patients {{over the age}} of 65 cause the general practitionermore work than do other groups of patients on his list. The morbidity study in general practice showed that elderly patients (over 65) had about twice as many con¬ sultations as children and young adults. (Logan and Cushion, 1958.) This workload in the elderly has been recognised by the Department of Health and Social Security in the payment of an increased capitation fee for such patients. No other group of patients attract an increased capitation fee. An opportunity arose in our practice to study the work caused by recently registered patients and to see whether this differed in any way from patients who had been registered with the practice for some time. Method The date of admission of all patients to the practice was obtained {{from the front of the}} record envelopes, EC 6 or EC 7; or failing this, from the executive council files. This information was transferred to a punched card together with identification data for each patient including <b>surname,</b> <b>forename</b> <b>and</b> date of birth. A list of patients registeringduring the years 1955 - 59 and during 1970 was obtained from these cards and classified by sex. Random numbers were used to identify 50 males and 50 females who registered during 1955 - 59. From the list of patients who registered during 1970, 50 males and 50 females were identified to match as closely as possible by date of birth with thoseidentified by random numbers from the 1955 - 59 registrations.

50|$|Arakiel is an Armenian <b>forename</b> <b>and</b> <b>surname.</b> It is {{the source}} of the patronym Arakelian. Arakiel was a {{relatively}} common Armenian forename, but lost popularity during the 19th and 20th centuries. It was most commonly used by Armenians living throughout Southern Asia. Its occurrence as a surname has its origins in India. Whereas Armenians in Armenian used patronymic names ending in -ian or -yan, Armenians in India appended their father's name to their name. Due to the prevailing British rule in India around the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, many Armenians took fixed <b>surnames</b> <b>and</b> thus the <b>surname</b> arose.|$|R
