5|$|Two former Flames {{were brought}} {{back into the}} fold {{on the first day}} of the free agent signing period. Calgary first signed Alex Tanguay to a one-year, $1.7 million {{contract}} and then generated considerable debate by signing Olli Jokinen to a two-year, $6 million deal. The re-acquisition of Jokinen was especially <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> fans and media alike, as the centre was shipped to the New York Rangers in a controversial trade only four months previous after a disappointing 2009–10 season in Calgary. The signing was sharply criticized by local and national media, though reaction amongst fans was mixed as polls suggested only a minority opposed the moves.|$|E
5|$|Finding American {{distributors}} {{proved more}} troublesome. Memento was screened for various studio heads (including Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein) in March 2000. Although {{most of the}} executives loved the film and praised Nolan's talent, all passed on distributing the picture, believing it was too confusing and would not attract a large audience. After famed independent film director Steven Soderbergh saw the film and learned it was not being distributed, he championed the film in interviews and public events, giving it even more publicity, {{although he did not}} secure a distributor. Newmarket, in a financially risky move, decided to distribute the film itself. After the first few weeks of distribution, Memento had reached more than 500 theaters and earned a domestic total of $25million in its box-office run. The film's success was <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> those who passed on the film, so much so that Weinstein realized his mistake and tried to buy the film from Newmarket.|$|E
25|$|In a {{more recent}} work, {{historian}} David Tucker (1998) attempts to rehabilitate the Mugwumps. According to Tucker, the Mugwumps embodied the liberalism of the 19th century, and their rejection by 20th-century historians, who embraced the government intervention of the New Deal and the Great Society, is not <b>surprising.</b> <b>To</b> Tucker, their eloquent writings speak for themselves, and are testament to a high minded civic morality.|$|E

25|$|The Seat of the Clan Mackenzie, Castle Leod {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the inspiration behind Castle Leoch, the home of the Clan Mackenzie, in Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. It was considered as a filming location for the TV series, however, Doune Castle was selected due to its ease of location. This may be <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> viewers who know Castle Leod as the seat of the Clan Mackenzie and accurately represents the historical period which Diana Gabaldon seeks to portray.|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, {{in a move}} <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> many {{employees}} and railroad industry observers alike, the FEC was purchased by the principal investors who also control short line railroad operator RailAmerica. John Giles was named chairman, and David Rohal was named president. Both men were also principals with major responsibilities at RailAmerica as well, although the ownership of FEC and RailAmerica were not linked corporately, and the spinoff of RailAmerica as a publicly traded company did not include FEC.|$|E
25|$|Since G protein–coupled receptors {{are known}} to {{activate}} Signal transduction in cells, {{it should not be}} <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> find MC1R involved in development. As one example at the cellular level, preventing signalling by MC1R stopped erythropoiesis from proceeding from the polychromatic cell stage (poly-E in the figure) to the orthochromatic cell stage (ortho-E in the diagram). The same report showed that neutralizing antibodies to MC1R prevented phosphorylation of STAT5 by erythropoietin, and that MC2R and MC5R were also involved, as shown in their model.|$|E

25|$|On September 5, 2006, Redstone removed Freston as President and CEO of Viacom and {{replaced}} him with director and former Viacom counsel Philippe Dauman. Redstone also brought back former CFO Tom Dooley. This was <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> many, as Freston {{had been seen}} by many as Redstone's heir apparent, and Redstone had touted that Freston would run the company after he retired. Redstone publicly stated that he let Freston go because of Viacom's lack of aggressiveness in the digital/online arena, lack of contact with investors, and a lackluster upfront (coupled with falling viewership) at MTV Networks.|$|E
25|$|Doom’s next PPV outing did {{not come}} with the same success. Along with the Steiner Brothers, The Road Warriors, and the Samoan Swat Team they were entered in a one night, tag team round robin tournament. They did not score a single point, ending dead last in the tournament. Doom’s misfortune {{continued}} as Woman soon dropped the team and left the federation. Then on February 6, 1990, Doom were defeated by the Steiner Brothers {{and as a result}} of the stipulation were forced to unmask. When Doom unmasked, it was hardly <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> see Ron Simmons and Butch Reed underneath the black hoods.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the {{plebiscite}} came as a great surprise to most commentators because few had predicted that it would fail. The Labor movement, and the 'anti' cause in general, had fought under many disadvantages, and the 'yes' campaign had most of the media, many major public institutions, {{and many of the}} state governments on its side. Supporters of the referendum were circumspect in their analysis of the result, noting that only a few percentage points and fewer than 75,000 voters had separated the results. The support for the vote in Victoria was <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> many, given that it had often been the locus of anti-conscription rhetoric.|$|E

25|$|As {{a member}} of the RTK family and with {{responsibilities}} as diverse as Ephs, it is not <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> learn that the Ephs have been implicated in several aspects of cancer. While used extensively throughout development, Ephs are rarely detected in adult tissues. Elevated levels of expression and activity have been correlated with the growth of solid tumors, with Eph receptors of both classes A and B being over expressed {{in a wide range of}} cancers including melanoma, breast, prostate, pancreatic, gastric, esophageal, and colon cancer, as well as hematopoietic tumors. Increased expression was also correlated with more malignant and metastatic tumors, consistent with the role of Ephs in governing cell movement.|$|E
25|$|The rapidity {{with which}} the South Vietnamese {{position}} collapsed in 1975 was <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> most American and South Vietnamese observers, and probably to the North Vietnamese and their allies as well. For instance, a memo prepared by the CIA and U.S. Army Intelligence and published on March 5 indicated that South Vietnam could hold out through the current dry season—i.e., at least until 1976. These predictions proved to be grievously in error. Even as that memo was being released, General Dũng was preparing a major offensive in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, which began on 10 March {{and led to the}} capture of Buôn Ma Thuột. The ARVN began a disorderly and costly retreat, hoping to redeploy its forces and hold the southern part of South Vietnam, perhaps an enclave south of the 13th parallel.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, this {{organization}} of power based upon personal relationships peculiar to the feudal system ensured that, {{after he became}} king of Scotland in 1124, {{the only thing that}} kept David from pursuing a policy of vigorous expansion was his friendship with Henry. To be sure, it should not be <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> learn that David harboured territorial ambitions– such desires were cultivated by the prevailing culture of the Normans, the greatest warriors of the age, and applauded if they ended in conquest– nor should it be any surprise that he soon sought to express them upon Henry’s death. That he should seek to place those ambitions upon a solid basis of propriety would have been even less remarkable, had a suitable excuse to attack not been conveniently at hand.|$|E

25|$|All of the manuscripts are codices, {{which was}} <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> the first {{scholars}} who examined the texts {{because it was}} believed that the papyrus codex was not extensively used by Christians until the 4th century. Most of the manuscripts dated to the 3rd century, with some as early as the 2nd. The manuscripts also helped scholars understand the construction of papyrus codices. There is significant variation between the construction of each manuscript. Page size ranges from about 14 by 24.2cm (P. III) to 18 by 33cm (P. VI). Some of the manuscripts were constructed of a single gathering (quire) of papyrus sheets (Pap. II, VII, IX + X), while in others the gathering varies from a single sheet (I) to five (V) or seven (VII). The largest codex (P. IX/X) is believed to have contained roughly 236 pages.|$|E
25|$|Fraenkel et al. (1973, pp.303304) {{explain why}} Skolem's result was so <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> set theorists in the 1920s. Gödel's {{completeness}} theorem and the compactness theorem were not proved until 1929. These theorems illuminated {{the way that}} first-order logic behaves and established its finitary nature, although Gödel's original proof of the completeness theorem was complicated. Leon Henkin's alternative proof of the completeness theorem, which is now a standard technique for constructing countable models of a consistent first-order theory, was not presented until 1947. Thus, in 1922, the particular properties of first-order logic that permit Skolem's paradox to go through were not yet understood. It is now known that Skolem's paradox is unique to first-order logic; if set theory is studied using higher-order logic with full semantics then {{it does not have}} any countable models, due to the semantics being used.|$|E
25|$|Ruby is said {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of least astonishment (POLA), meaning that the language should behave {{in such a way}} as to minimize confusion for experienced users. Matsumoto has said his primary design goal was to make a language that he himself enjoyed using, by minimizing programmer work and possible confusion. He has said that he had not applied the principle of least astonishment to the design of Ruby, but nevertheless the phrase has come to be closely associated with the Ruby programming language. The phrase has itself been a source of surprise, as novice users may take it to mean that Ruby's behaviors try to closely match behaviors familiar from other languages. In a May 2005 discussion on the newsgroup comp.lang.ruby, Matsumoto attempted to distance Ruby from POLA, explaining that because any design choice will be <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> someone, he uses a personal standard in evaluating surprise. If that personal standard remains consistent, there would be few surprises for those familiar with the standard.|$|E

25|$|Oath-helping {{involved}} the party undergoing proof swearing {{to the truth}} of his claim or denial and having that oath reinforced by five or more others, chosen either by the party or by the court. The numbers of helpers required and the form of their oath differed from place to place and upon the nature of the dispute. If either the party or any of the helpers failed in the oath, either refusing to take it or sometimes even making an error in the required formula, the proof failed and the case was adjudged to the other side. It appears <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> moderns that so important a matter might be settled by one and his friends falsely swearing an oath. In a society in which each was known to his neighbour and in which religious emphasis was placed upon the sanctity of an oath, the system was probably more satisfactory. As 'wager of law' it remained a way of determining cases in the common law until its abolition in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Gulistan {{left the}} {{possibility}} of conflict open between the two countries, thus being weak from the start. Russia's main priority before the war was {{to focus on the}} wars being fought with Napoleon, which explains the small numbers of troops it dedicated for the Russo-Persian War. The treaty of Gulistan was mainly a way for both countries to “gain a breath” so that the Russo-Persian War could end and they could focus on other issues. After the Treaty was signed, Persia started to rapidly build up its army once more, as Fath Ali Shah was fully devoted to regaining the lost territories. It was <b>surprising</b> <b>to</b> no one when Fath Ali Shah ordered his military commander, Abbas Mirza, to start training troops in 1823, three years in advance of the second Russo-Persian War of the century, which was three times as much military preparation as he had devoted to the first War. The clergy in Persia also publicly announced that the jihad against Russia was not over. In 1826, once again Persia attacked the territories lost to Russia (with the British supporting the Persians). The second Russo-Persian War lasted two years and Persia lost 35,000 troops to Russia’s 8,000. Performing poorly in the war, Persia lost, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Turkmenchay, which resulted in the loss of modern-day Armenia and the remaining parts of contemporary Azerbaijan.|$|E
