40|$|Thermodynamic {{predictions}} {{suggest that}} silicon {{has the potential}} to be a potent sintering aid for Ti-Ni alloys because small additions of Si lower the solidus of Ti-Ni alloys appreciably (> 200 degrees C by 1 wt. % Si). A systematic study has been made of the effect of Si on the sintering of a Ti- 3 Ni alloy at 1300 degrees C. The sintered density increased from 91. 8 % theoretical density (TD) to 99. 2 %TD with increasing Si from 0 % to 2 %. Microstructural examination reveals that coarse particles and/or continuous networks of Ti(5) Si(3) form along grain boundaries when the addition of Si exceeds 1 %. The grain boundary Ti(5) Si(3) phase leads to predominantly intergranular fracture and therefore a sharp decrease in ductility concomitant with increased tensile strengths. The optimum addition of Si is proposed to be <= 1 %. Dilatometry experiments reveal different <b>shrinkage</b> <b>behaviours</b> with respect to different Si contents. Interrupted differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments and corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses clarify the sequence of phase formation during heating.

40|$|International audienceThe {{shrinkage}} {{characteristics of}} buffer-backfilling materials {{play an important}} role in the security and stability of the high-level radioactive waste geological disposal system. COx argillite is considered as a kind of potential buffer-backfilling materials in France. In this investigation, both the initially saturated compacted COx specimens and the paste-like COx specimens are prepared and subjected to different test methods to study their volumetric <b>shrinkage</b> <b>behaviours.</b> For the compacted specimens, it is found that the volumetric shrinkage deformation is significantly influenced by the initial dry density; the shrinkage limit, shrinkage efficiency and shrinkage strain decrease with the increasing dry density; in addition, it is observed that the shrinkage direction of specimens shows obvious anisotropism. For example, at low degree of compaction, the radial shrinkage strain is higher than axial shrinkage strain, and the shrinkage geometry factor is larger than 3; however, the contrary results are obtained at high degree of compaction. For the paste-like specimens, three shrinkage stages can be distinguished: normal shrinkage, residual shrinkage and zero shrinkage; most of the volume shrinkage deformation occurs before the air-entry point while the soil is still fully saturated. A group of four general shrinkage models are employed to fit the shrinkage curve of the paste-like specimens.

Heat output from HLW will dissipate through the surrounding rocks and induce complex thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes. In highly consolidated clayey rocks, thermal effects are particularly significant because of their very low permeability and water-saturated state. Thermal impact on {{the integrity of the}} geological barriers is of most importance with regard to the long-term safety of repositories. This study focuses on numerical analysis of thermal effects on hydro-mechanical properties of clayey rock using a coupled thermo-mechanical multiphase flow (TH 2 M) model which is implemented in the finite element programme OpenGeoSys (OGS). The material properties of the numerical model are characterised by a transversal isotropic elastic model based on Hooke's law, a non-isothermal multiphase flow model based on van Genuchten function and Darcy's law, and a transversal isotropic heat transport model based on Fourier's law. In the numerical approaches, special {{attention has been paid to}} the thermal expansion of three different phases: gas, fluid and solid, which could induce changes in pore pressure and porosity.

Temperature effects on both shrinkage kinetics and total diameter reduction were found to be different from low solids milk drying. A high drying temperature at 110 degrees C led to negligible droplet shrinkage at X range between 1 and 0. 3 kg/kg. An increase in temperature resulted in larger particles after drying.

40|$|Hydration and {{restrained}} <b>shrinkage</b> crack <b>behaviours</b> {{of different}} concrete grades were independently monitored using a non-contact electrical resistivity apparatus and a novel plastic ring mould respectively. The electrical resistivity curve trend is similar {{for all the}} concrete samples, in which the lowest concrete grade has the highest resistivity until reaching acceleration point which was then overtaken by the highest concrete grade. Four different hydration periods were identified upon which the hydration process can be based; these periods are classified into dissolution, induction, acceleration and deceleration periods. Also, initial and final setting times for the samples were examined, which confirmed that the decreasing rate of resistivity development for the lower concrete grade corresponds to its initial setting time range. Restrained shrinkage crack result shows that the highest concrete grade propagated cracks earlier than the lowest concrete grade and thereby the higher cracking potential of higher strength mixture was confirmed. Linear fitting was then developed to estimate concrete crack potential based on its electrical resistivity. Hence, both electrical resistivity measurement and novel plastic mould (which is very cheap, user-friendly and fast filled) are hereby proposed as a convenient alternative means of assessing concrete cracking potential...|$|R

Solid-based coordinates were applied to simplify incorporation of shrinkage. Liquid diffusion, gas convection and vapour and air diffusion were incorporated as mass transport mechansims. In the heat balance the convective heat transport and heat conduction were included. Specific models for the transport parameters were developed from data in the literature. The model was evaluated for four cases of drying where moisture and temperature distribution data through the thickness of paper are available. An algorithm was proposed to calculate unknown parameters directly from the experimental data. Three remaining parameters were obtained by non-linear regression of calculated moisture and temperature distribution to the experimental data. Simulations showed that the model can predict the drying behaviour and the moisture and temperature gradients for convective drying of kraft, and hot surface drying of kraft and sulphite pulp sheets with low density.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Wavy type Single Chamber Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SC-SOFCs) {{have been shown to}} be conducive to improving the effective electrochemical reaction area contributing to higher performance, compared with planar type SC-SOFCs of the same diameter. This study presents a fabrication process for wavy type SC-SOFCs with a single fabrication step via co-sintering of a triple-layer structure. The monitoring and observation of the curvature evolution of bi- and triple-layer structures during co-sintering has resulted in an improved process with reduced manufacturing time and effort, as regards the co-sintering process for multi-layer structures. Investigation using in-situ monitoring helps different <b>shrinkage</b> <b>behaviours</b> of each porous layer to minimise mismatched stresses along with avoidance of severe warping and cracking. In the co-sintering of the multi-layer structures, the induced in-plane stresses contribute to curvature evolution in the structure, which can be utilised in the design of a curved multi-layer structure via the co-sintering process. For intermediate temperature SOFCs, the materials used are NiO/CGO for anode; CGO for electrolyte; and LSCF for cathode. These materials are tape-casted with 20 µm thickness and assembled for bi- and triple-layer structures by hot pressing. Sintering mismatch stresses have been analysed in bi-layer structures, consisting of NiO/CGO-CGO and CGO-LSCF. The maximum sintering mismatch stress was calculated at interface of bi-layer structure in the top layer. In order to achieve the desired wavy type triple-layer structure, flexible green layers of each component were stacked up and laid on alumina rods to support the curvature during the process. In-situ observation, to monitor the shrinkage of each material and the curvature evolution of the structures, was performed using a long focus microscope (Infinity K- 2). With these values, the main factors such as viscosity, shrinkage rate of each material, and curvature rate are investigated to determine the sintering mismatch stresses. This enables the prediction of curvature for triple-layer structure and the prediction is validated by in-situ monitoring of the triple-layer structure co-sintering process. Zero-deflection condition is confirmed to maintain initial shape during co-sintering and helps to minimise the development of undesired curvature in the triple-layer structure. Performance testing of the wavy cell was carried out in a methane-air mixture (CH 4 :O 2 = 1 : 1). In comparison with a planar SC-SOFC, it showed higher OCV which might be attributed to not only macro deformation, but also microstructural distribution affecting the effective gas diffusion paths and electrochemical active sites...|$|R

Dynamic measurement of the shrinkage of the castings after ejection is taken by the method of photomechanical in a thermally controlled environment representative of a workshop production one. The technique of photomechanical used allows measurement without contact of the shrinkage in the principal plan of the part. It is shown that the profile of temperature quickly becomes uniform in the thickness of the part after the phase of ejection and that the kinetics of shrinkage is controlled by the kinetics of cooling for the PS as for PP. One shows the influence of certain processing parameters on the evolution of the shrinkage, in particular, the dependence of the shrinkage according to the temperature of the mould and the packing pressure.

40|$|Many {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} and applied to prevent and/or remediate infrastructural damage caused by expansive soils throughout the world. Of these techniques, traditional chemical (lime and cement) stabilization has gained world attention because of {{a good understanding of}} the underlying mechanisms, availability of technical guidelines, and years of demonstrated field experiences. However, despite the global acceptance of traditional additives for treating expansive soil, other environmentally benign alternatives have been an important subject of research due to the inherent health and safety concerns for traditional admixtures. One such alternative is from the paper industry that manufactures pulp from wood and in the process produces over 50 million tons annually of a waste substance known as lignosulfonate (LS). This substance has been disposed of as a waste product resulting in colossal disposal cost; however, it does have a potential application in geotechnical engineering under the concept of sustainable development. This investigation into LS admixture consists of experimental and theoretical studies. The experimental investigation involved a laboratory evaluation of the efficacy of LS admixture in controlling the swell potential of a remoulded expansive soil. The swell potential was examined in terms of percent swell and swell pressure of the soil. In addition to these engineering properties, the Atterberg limits, unconfined compressive strength, durability (wet/dry and freeze/thaw), compaction characteristics, permeability, consolidation characteristics, and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>behaviours</b> were also investigated. Furthermore, the mechanism by which the remoulded soil was modified or altered by the LS admixture was probed and identified. The optimum content of LS admixture was found to be about 2 % by dry weight of the soil. Standard geotechnical laboratory tests performed on untreated and treated compacted soil specimens showed significant and consistent changes in the swell potential and other engineering properties such that the percent swell decreased by 22 % while maintaining the soil’s pH. In some instances, identical specimens treated with 2 % cement were prepared and tested for comparison. Although the specimens treated with cement recorded a 33 % reduction in the percent swell, the ductile characteristics were replaced by brittleness and a significant increase in pH. Further analysis of the laboratory test data also suggested that LS admixture is a resourceful alternative for “low” swelling soils. This finding {{led to the formation of}} a “LS application chart” that will help geotechnical practitioners on admixture choice for a particular expansive soil deposits. The physical-chemical analyses of untreated and 2 % LS treated specimens were studied microstructurally after 7 days of curing. When LS was added into expansive soil, the stabilization mechanisms consisted of an insignificant exchange of interlayer cations due to the “cover-up-effect”, basal/peripheral adsorption on mineral surfaces through hydrogen bonding (water bridging), direct bonding to dehydrated cations with the subsequent formation of flocculation-aggregates, initial expansion of diffuse double layer and water entrapment, and a waterproofing effect. An elemental analysis of untreated and treated specimens suggested inter-molecular interactions between soil minerals and the LS admixture as opposed to major chemical reactions. Thus, LS summarily altered the crystallographic characteristics of the soil minerals, and helped to reduce shrink-swell behaviour of the otherwise expansive soil. The theoretical aspect of this research work involved the development of a robust mathematical model to predict the swell behaviour of expansive soil treated with LS. Relationships were proposed to estimate the suction behaviour of treated soil using laboratory data obtained experimentally. Suction behaviour was governed by a single constant (β), which depends on an input variable; the degree of saturation (Sd). A reasonable correlation was found between the percent swell determined experimentally and the predicted values. A non-traditional admixture such as LS has the potential to become a technically and economically competitive alternative in the stabilization of expansive soils. With over 50 million tons being produced annually, the successful use of LS admixture as a new stabilization material for expansive soil appears to be one of many viable solutions to the sustainable use of a waste by-product, green construction, and as well as saving the disposal problems inherent in the paper manufacturing industry...|$|R
40|$|Due to its {{different}} mix composition, e. g. use of superplasticizer, lower water/powder ratio (W/P) {{and higher}} paste volume, and its more dense microstructure, different mechanisms and magnitudes concerning the time-dependent deformability, i. e. shrinkage and creep, hold for limestone powder type self-compacting concrete (SCC). For this reason, experimental investigations concerning the <b>shrinkage</b> and creep <b>behaviour</b> of 7 limestone powder type SCC mixtures and 1 reference, traditionally vibrated, concrete mixture (TC 1) are performed. Water/cement ratio (W/C), cement/powder ratio (C/P), aggregate type and cement type are studied. The experimental data {{have been used}} to verify the accuracy of the CEB-FIP Model Code 1990 (MC- 90) in terms of long-term deformations. Test results revealed in general higher shrinkage and creep deformations for the SCC mixtures compared with the TC 1 mix. However, whereas the shrinkage deformations are underestimated by CEB-FIP Model Code 1990 (MC- 90), the creep and overall behaviour of the limestone powder type SCC mixtures are rather well predicted by the same model. In order to properly predict the time-dependent behaviour of limestone powder type SCC in cases of concrete structures (highly) sensitive to shrinkage and creep, a modification of the MC- 90 in terms of the total shrinkage strain prediction is proposed by the authors. For creep, test results revealed that the MC- 90 creep coefficient prediction could remain unmodified for limestone powder type SCC application. status: publishe...|$|R
