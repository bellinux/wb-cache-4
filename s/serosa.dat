5|$|The {{majority}} of insects hatch from eggs. The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell (chorion) {{that consists of}} maternal tissue. In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought resistant. This is because inside the chorion two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the amnion and the <b>serosa.</b> This <b>serosa</b> secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against desiccation. In Schizophora however the <b>serosa</b> does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting matter. Some species of insects, like the cockroach Blaptica dubia, as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are ovoviviparous. The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female, and then hatch immediately upon being laid. Some other species, {{such as those in}} the genus of cockroaches known as Diploptera, are viviparous, and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive. Some insects, like parasitic wasps, show polyembryony, where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos. Insects may be univoltine, bivoltine or multivoltine, i.e. they may have one, two or many broods (generations) in a year.|$|E
5|$|The muscular {{layer of}} the {{esophagus}} has two types of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: {{one in which the}} muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The outermost {{layer of the}} esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in <b>serosa.</b> This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a <b>serosa.</b>|$|E
5|$|Endometrial cancer {{frequently}} metastasizes to {{the ovaries}} and Fallopian tubes when the cancer {{is located in}} {{the upper part of the}} uterus, and the cervix when the cancer is in the lower part of the uterus. The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the <b>serosa,</b> then into other reproductive and pelvic structures. When the lymphatic system is involved, the pelvic and para-aortic nodes are usually first to become involved, but in no specific pattern, unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other gynecologic cancer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It {{was shown}} {{previously}} that ovarian tumours, which frequently metastasise to serous surfaces, {{can be produced}} in dogs by prolonged administration of stilboestrol. The ability of non-ovarian serous surfaces to proliferate in response to stilboestrol, independently of ovarian metastases, was studied in 5 ovariectomised females and 4 entire males. Papillary proliferations occurred on the uterine <b>serosae</b> in 3 females and on the testicular and epididymal <b>serosae</b> in 2 males. In no case was there papillary proliferation on serous membranes of non-genital organs. One of 2 entire females given stillboestrol had proliferations regarded as metastases of ovarian origin on non-genital serous membranes. It is concluded that, in addition to ovarian changes, stilboestrol can cause primary proliferative lesions in the serous membranes of certain genital organs in both sexes. There {{is no evidence that}} serous membranes of non-genital organs be capable of a primary proliferative response to stilboestrol. JABARA [I, 21 found that ovarian tumours could be produced in dogs by the prolonged administration of stilboestrol.

5|$|In the early, or {{fulminating}} form, hemorrhaging {{appears on}} {{the second or third}} day as sub-conjunctival bleeding turns the whites of the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky erythema, petechiae, and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, <b>serosa,</b> muscle, and, rarely, the epicardium, liver, testes, ovaries and bladder. Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present. A later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 8–10 days. The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period, and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage. Patients in the early stage of disease show a decrease in coagulation factors (e.g. platelets, prothrombin, and globulin) and an increase in circulating antithrombin. Patients in the late stage have significant thrombocytopenia; however, deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe. Some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin. This form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain. Hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal.|$|E

In a further eight infected cattle, increases in permeability of vessels associated with serosal surfaces were demonstrated by labelling with either colloidal carbon or Evans blue. Intravenous injections of carbon provided both macroscopic and histological labelling of affected vessels.

40|$|Introduction In most homeothermic vertebrates, pigment {{cells are}} {{confined}} to the skin, since melanoblast is the only neural crest lineage that can migrate dorsolaterally, between the ectoderm into the derm. Silkie fowl, is a naturally occurring chicken mutant from common chicken, in which pigment cells occupy most connective tissues, given them a dramatic blue-black pigmentation. This occurs because melanoblasts continue to migrate, extensively dorsolateral and ventrally, since the natural tissue barriers, which normally restrain melanoblast migration, are not present in the Silkie fowl. Objectives The authors document, using macro and microscopic figures, the normal distribution of the melanic pigment in the Silkie fowl tissues. Material and Methods 2 adult Silkie fowls were necropsied and samples fixed in 10 % neutral-buffered formalin and processed for routine histopathological diagnosis. Results and discussion The distribution of the melanin pigment was observed in the periosteum, perichondrium, connective tissues of adventitia and <b>serosae</b> from several internal organs, {{as well as in}} the myocardium, perimysium and endomysium. Conclusion The knowledge of the normal distribution of the melanic pigment in the Silkie fowl tissues allow a better understanding of the histopathological conditions affecting this particular breed...|$|R
40|$|Aspergillosis is a {{fungal disease}} caused by fungi {{of the genus}} Aspergillus, in {{particular}} A. fumigatus and A. flavus. This paper focuses on anatomopathological aspects resulting from a chronic infection from Aspergillus spp in the chicken (Gallus domesticus), in the herring gull (Larus cachinnans micaelli) and in the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa rufa). Microscopically, we observed some histological lesions {{that are related to}} the two typical forms of Aspergillosis: a deep nodular form, typical of organs with a non-aerated parenchyma, and a non-encapsulated superficial diffuse form typical of the <b>serosae</b> and the lung. The observed forms of aspergillosis have been found in animals raised in poor hygienic environmental conditions or malnourished animals (chicken); in wild birds from wildlife recovery centres (herring gull), which underwent some forms of stress, such as traumas, detention, starvation, extended antibiotic treatments; in game birds (red-legged partridge) used for restocking natural areas that had been negatively affected by such stressors as captivity in aviaries, containment and transport in cages, release in unsuitable environments and malnutrition. The observed anatomopathological and istopathological aspects can therefore be regarded as the outcome of a number of factors that have reduced the typical resistance of the species and impaired the efficiency of their immune systems...|$|R
40|$|Green {{leaves of}} Tetrapterys multiglandulosa A. Juss were fed to {{pregnant}} goats from day 35 of pregnancy. Five goats received 10 g/kgBW (group I), five received 20 g/kgBW (group II) and five {{were used as}} control (group III), and received only hay, fresh grass and commercial ration. All animals were clinically examined daily and submitted to ultrasonography every three days. Fetal death and vulvar catarrhal discharge with subsequent abortion were observed {{at the end of}} the second month of pregnancy in group II and at the third month of pregnancy in group I. Animals from groups I and II were slaughtered after abortion and necropsied. Goats from the control group were necropsied at the same time. The main lesions in the aborted goats were focal placentitis with early involution (apoptosis) and placentary coagulation necrosis, acute focal endometritis and vulvo-vaginal petechiae. All aborted fetuses were underdeveloped when compared to control fetuses, probably due to fetal malnutrition, since no congenital malformations could be noted. The majority of aborted fetuses showed some degree of autolysis, as fetal death occurred five and three days before abortion, in groups I and II, respectively.

25|$|Adhesions, or {{scar tissue}} between various organs {{that are not}} {{normally}} attached within the abdomen, may occur whenever an abdominal surgery is performed. It is often seen secondary to reperfusion injury where there is ischemic bowel or after intestinal distention. This injury causes neutrophils {{to move into the}} <b>serosa</b> and mesothelium to be lost, which the body then attempts to repair using fibrin and collagen, leading to adhesion formation between adjacent tissues with either fibrinous or fibrous material. Adhesions may encourage a volvulus, as the attachment provides a pivot point, or force a tight turn between two adjacent loops that are now attached, leading to partial obstruction. For this reason, clinical signs vary from silent lesions to acute obstruction, encouraging future colics including intestinal obstruction or strangulation, and requiring further surgery and risk of adhesion. Generally, adhesions form within the first two months following surgery. Adhesions occur most commonly in horses with small intestinal disease (22% of all surgical colics), foals (17%), those requiring enterotomy or a resection and anastomosis, or those that develop septic peritonitis.|$|E
30|$|Results Throughout {{the study}} period, 77 {{patients}} presented with HAD at our ICU. Twenty-nine patients (37.7  %) had only KS, 21 (27.3  %) MCD, 11 (14.3  %) HAL, 8 (10.4  %) had the 3 conditions and 8 other patients (10.4  %) had lymphoma {{not related to}} HHV 8 but associated with KS. Sixty-one patients (79  %) were HIV-infected with a HIV viral load of 3.3 log (1.6 – 5) and a CD 4 count of 90 /mm 3 (39 – 192). Seven patients had received solid organ transplantation (5 kidney transplants, 1 liver and 1 pulmonary transplant), and 9 other patients had Mediterranean KS or HIV-negative MCD. Median HHV 8 viral load was 2.94 log (0 – 4.87). Reasons for ICU admission were acute respiratory failure in 33 patients (42.9  %), shock in 25 (32.5  %), acute kidney injury in 7 (9.1  %), hematologic failure in 7 (9.1  %) and coma in 6 patients (7.8  %). Simplified Acute Physiology Score 2 (SAPS 2) at ICU admission was 47 (37.7 – 57). Mechanical ventilation was required in 38 patients (49  %), vasoactive agents in 32 (42  %), renal replacement therapy in 21 (27  %) and blood transfusion in 40 patients (52  %). HAD were associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in 34 patients (40  %). Infection occurred in 64 patients (83  %), 59  % being microbiologically documented. Chemotherapy was administered in 29 patients (38  %). ICU mortality was 15 / 77 patients (19.5  %). Lengths of ICU and hospital stays were 4  days (2 – 8) and 21  days (9.3 – 37.8), respectively. Hospital mortality was 27 / 77 (35.1  %), and mortality at a median follow-up of 245  days was 44 / 77 (57.1  %). By univariate analysis, factors associated with increased hospital mortality were the presence of all-cause lymphoma HHV 8 -associated or not (59.2 vs 22  %, p = < 0.01), the need for mechanical ventilation (51.3 vs 17.9  %, p <  0.01) or vasoactive agents (58.1 vs 19.6  % p <  0.01), higher SAPS 2 (53 (43.2 – 62) vs 43.5 (33 – 54), p =  0.02), hypoprotidemia (58 (46.2 – 64.2) vs 63 (55 – 75), p =  0.02), high bilirubinemia (51 (15.3 – 97.6) vs 15.8 (12.5 – 34.5), p =  0.04), high alkaline phosphatase (136 (107.2 – 212.2) vs 98 (62 – 143.75), p =  0.01) and number of involved <b>serosae</b> (72.7  % for 2 <b>serosae</b> or more vs 30  % for 1 vs 28.6  % for none, p =  0.02).

40|$|To {{determine}} whether the virulence of Streptococcus suis type 2 {{is associated with the}} phenotype of the strain, we infected newborn germfree pigs with 10 strains of S. suis type 2 categorized by three phenotypes. In an earlier study, the phenotypes were distinguished by {{the presence or absence of}} the muramidase-released protein (MRP) and an extracellular factor (EF) and were designated MRP+ EF+, MRP+ EF- and MRP- EF-. Pigs were first inoculated with Bordetella bronchiseptica to predispose them to infection and were then intranasally inoculated with the streptococci. Strains of the MRP+ EF+ phenotype induced fever and increased the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in blood. Specific clinical signs of disease such as nervous disorders and lameness were also observed. At necropsy bacteriologic and pathologic examination disclosed meningoencephalitis, polyserositis, and polyarthritis. Strains of the MRP+ EF- phenotype induced only nonspecific clinical signs of disease such as recumbency, lack of appetite, and fever; only slight pathologic changes were detected in the <b>serosae.</b> The four strains of the MRP- EF- phenotype induced no signs of disease. These findings indicate that the 110 -kDa EF and, to a lesser degree, the 136 -kDa MRP may be associated with the virulence of the bacterium.

40|$|Information {{about the}} {{ultrastructure}} of connective (interstitial) cells supporting the pleural mesothelium is scarce. Our aim {{has been to}} examine whether telocytes (TCs) are present in pleura, as in epicardium and mesentery. TCs are a distinct type of cell, characterized by specific prolongations named telopodes (Tp). We have used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron tomography (ET) to determine whether ultrastructural diagnostic criteria accepted for TCs are fulfilled {{by any of the}} cell subpopulations existing in the sub-mesothelial layer in mouse and human pleura. TCs have been identified with TEM by their characteristic prolongations. Tp appear long and moniliform, because of the alternation of podomeres (thin segments of less than 0. 2  μm) and podoms (small dilations accommodating caveolae, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum). Tp ramifications follow a dichotomic pattern and establish specialized cell-to-cell junctional complexes. TCs, via their Tp, seem to form an interstitial network beneath the mesothelium, covering about two-thirds of the abluminal mesothelial layer. ET has revealed complex junctional structures and tight junctions connecting pleural TCs, and small vesicles at this level in Tp. Thus, pleural TCs share significant similarities with TCs described in other <b>serosae.</b> Whether TCs are a (major) player in mesothelial-cell-induced tissue repair remains to be established. Nevertheless, the extremely long thin Tp and complex junctional structures that they form and the release of vesicles (or exosomes) indicate the participation of TCs in long-distance homo- or heterocellular communication...|$|R

40|$|The spleen is {{the most}} common primary site for hemangiosarcoma in dogs. The tumor is {{characterized}} by rapid growth and widespread metastasis, presumably due to both its tissue of origin, the vascular endothelium, and its resultant ready access to systemic circulation. The most common clinical presentation is a palpable abdominal mass, hemoperitoneum, anemia, shock and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. At the Small Annual Species Hospital (National Autonomous University of Mexico) arrived a German Shepherd dog, a 7 year old male with the next signs: Abdominal distention, depression and anorexia. At physical examination it showed weak pulse, cyanosis, high respiratory frequency and liquid in the abdominal cavity. The radiological study showed an image that was compatible with a peritoneal effusion. An abdominal puncture was made, and a sanguinolent liquid was obtained. Fluid therapy and blood transfusion were renovated and the hematocrit was decreased. After the therapy were established, a celiotomy extracting near 41 of intraperitoneal hemorrhagic liquid was done. Multiple tumoral nodules were observed in the spleen showing the origin of the bleeding. The liver presented several metastatic foci. A total splenectomy was performed taking also a biopsy of the hepatic nodules. The necropsy revealed large areas of hemorrhages and subcutaneous edema in the ventral abdomen. The liver had numerous subscapular hemorrhagic nodules; the other abdominal viscerae were icteric, and a few petechial hemorrhages were found on the <b>serosae.</b> Microscopic study of the affected organs showed primary foci of hemangiosarcoma in the spleen and metastasis to liver, epiploa and bronchial lymph nodules.

40|$|The {{expression}} of type VI collagen {{has been studied}} in mouse tissues. By Northern blotting, the mRNA for the alpha 1 (VI) chain was detectable in whole embryos at 10. 5 days postcoitum and steeply increased afterward. The messenger levels were high at birth, but decreased rapidly in the following days, reaching low levels in adult animals. In 2 -month-old mice, lung, skin, adrenal gland, heart, skeletal muscle and tail and fat {{were among the most}} active producers of alpha 1 (VI) mRNA. In situ hybridization first identified mRNA for alpha 1 (VI) collagen in mesenchymal cells of 10. 5 -day embryos in various locations, including <b>serosae,</b> branchial arches, large blood vessels and the cephalic mesenchyme. Staining increased at later stages of development and most connective tissues were positive at 16. 5 days and later. Strongly staining tissues were joints, intervertebral disks, perichondrium, periostium, dermis, skeletal muscle and heart valves, whereas cartilage and bone were very poorly labelled. Epithelia and the central nervous system were completely negative. In several organs, notably lung, salivary glands and the digestive tract, staining was concentrated underneath epithelia. This staining pattern was different from that for collagen type I, which was evenly distributed in the subepithelial mesenchyme. The pattern of distribution of the protein, revealed by immunocytochemistry, was coincident with that of the alpha 1 (VI) mRNA. In addition, the results confirmed that type VI collagen is preferentially deposited in the pericellular environment. This was particularly evident in skeletal muscle. The data show that type VI collagen is mainly produced by mesenchymal cells and suggest a role for the protein in delineating the boundary of distinct domains in connective tissue...|$|R
