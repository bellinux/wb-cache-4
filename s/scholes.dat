5|$|United {{were without}} first-choice central midfielders Keane and <b>Scholes,</b> as both were {{suspended}} {{after receiving a}} second yellow card in the competition. Ferguson reorganised the team, with Blomqvist and Butt replacing Keane and <b>Scholes,</b> Beckham moving from right-wing to centre-midfield and Giggs moving from the left to the right wing. United lined up in their normal 4–4–2 formation. This was the final match for Peter Schmeichel, who captained the team.|$|E
5|$|After {{his arrival}} in 2006, Carrick formed an {{effective}} partnership with Paul <b>Scholes,</b> with Carrick playing in a holding role and <b>Scholes</b> as a deep playmaker. This midfield partnership contributed to a change towards a continental playing style embraced by manager Alex Ferguson and assistant Carlos Queiroz, which relied on passing and keeping possession {{in contrast to the}} more traditionally direct and all-action style of English football. His unassuming style, however, has also led to a lack of attention from successive England national football team managers in favour of all-action midfielders such as Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, a fact noted by Carrick's club and national team captain Wayne Rooney.|$|E
40|$|The article {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} leisure {{in the sense of}} ancient <b>schole.</b> It strives to uncover the relationship between Aristotelian concept of theoretical activity and <b>schole</b> as vacuity. It shows a paradoxical character of <b>schole</b> as purposeless time that forms condition for a meaningful activity. How, then, to restore <b>schole</b> as vacuity today, when colonization of time expands...|$|R

5|$|In the 85thminute, <b>Scholes</b> clipped {{the ball}} {{over the top of}} the Barcelona {{defensive}} line to Rooney, who chested the ball down for Tevez, only to be given offside. <b>Scholes</b> then found Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to get back and put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just beyond the reach of Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but he put the ball high over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{used their}} {{third and final}} {{substitute}} in the 75thminute, replacing Giggs with Paul <b>Scholes,</b> who took over as team captain. Ronaldo and <b>Scholes</b> each received yellow cards in the 78th and 80thminutes, respectively; Ronaldo's yellow card was awarded for a robust shoulder-charge on Puyol as the Barcelona right back shepherded the ball out for a goal kick, while <b>Scholes</b> was booked for a late challenge on Busquets. While the referee played advantage after Scholes' foul, Iniesta cut inside from the left wing and hit a shot that was saved above the head of Van der Sar. An extended spell of Barcelona possession followed, as they strung a series of around 20 passes together, culminating with Puyol attempting to clip the ball over the onrushing Van der Sar, who blocked the shot. Both players went for the follow-up, but the Dutch goalkeeper was first to the ball and sent Puyol sprawling.|$|E

40|$|This {{conversation}} {{offers a}} discussion of the meaning, sense and social function of school, both as an institution and as a time-space for the practice of <b>schole</b> (free-time, leisure). It also discusses the different types of Greek time (aion, kairos, khronos) : <b>Schole</b> is, as aion or childhood, a further emergence, a radicalization of school as an experimental zone of subjectivity and of collectivity. <b>Schole</b> is, as aion or childhood, a further emergence, a radicalization of school as an experimental zone of subjectivity and of collectivity. The source of this radicalization is philosophy, {{to the extent that the}} philosophical impulse turns us inward upon ourselves in the interest, not of techniques for the enhancement of productive time, but of an emergent new brain: in the interest of new values, new sensibilities, new capacities, new connections, new centers of meaning, new bodies. Today we are in a global situation—the situation of late capitalism and late empire—in which school turns upon and ruthlessly suppresses <b>schole,</b> which distorts their relation almost beyond recognition. There is a struggle between school as a more efficient, far-reaching vehicle for the technical transformation of the chore curriculum, and <b>schole</b> as utopia. The paper also examines the place of childhood in educational discourse, and some critiques of the practice of community of philosophical inquiry in schools are considered as well as the role of questions and questioning in both philosophy and schooling. Finally, it problematizes the role of philosophy in school and in scholé: if the role of philosophy in <b>schole</b> is an active one, even an activist one, then the role of the child in producing dikaiosyne in school as <b>scholé</b> should be no less active. The conversation ends with some questions: in what way is the philosophical life preferable to the political life? Why are the politics of philosophy worth any more than the politics of the political order...|$|R

5|$|After {{a fairly}} cagey first 21 minutes, {{the first major}} {{incident}} of the game occurred when Paul <b>Scholes</b> and Claude Makélélé clashed in mid-air, resulting in both players being booked and <b>Scholes</b> having to leave the field for treatment to a bloody nose. The first goal of the game came five minutes later, when an interchange of passes between <b>Scholes</b> and Wes Brown after a throw-in on the right flank gave Brown time to pick out a cross for Cristiano Ronaldo, who directed his header past Petr Čech. Chelsea almost equalised in the 33rd minute when Frank Lampard's cross was headed back into the goal area by Didier Drogba. United's Rio Ferdinand, under pressure from Michael Ballack, was forced to head the ball towards his own goal and Edwin van der Sar pulled off a one-handed save to deny Chelsea a goal. United {{spent the rest of}} the first half pressing for a second goal, and had two good opportunities to extend their lead, but were denied by a double-save from Čech. Wayne Rooney delivered a long ball into the path of Ronaldo and the United goalscorer placed his cross on the head of the diving Carlos Tevez, only for Čech to deny him. Chelsea's failure to clear the loose ball gave Michael Carrick the chance to extend his side's lead, but Čech was again equal to the task with another save.|$|E
5|$|In the House, {{desultory}} {{debate on}} Fraser's censure motion ended with it being amended by the ALP majority into a condemnation of Fraser and passed on a party line vote. By 2.34pm, when Fraser rose {{and announced that}} he had been commissioned as Prime Minister, word of the dismissal had spread through the House. Fraser announced his intent to advise a double dissolution, and moved that the House adjourn. His motion was defeated. Fraser's new government suffered repeated defeats in the House, which passed a motion of no confidence in him, and asked the Speaker, Gordon <b>Scholes,</b> to urge the Governor-General to recommission Whitlam. <b>Scholes,</b> attempting to communicate this to the Governor General, was initially told that an appointment might not be possible that day, but after stating that he would reconvene the House and tell them of the refusal, was given an appointment with Kerr for 4.45pm.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United brought Giggs on at {{the start}} of extra time, the Welshman taking Fletcher's place in the midfield. They {{immediately}} tried to play him in down the left wing, but the pass was over-hit and went beyond Giggs. Arsenal finally got their first shot on target in the seventh minute of extra time, when a Van Persie free kick – awarded for a foul by Silvestre – forced a diving save from Carroll. Four minutes later, Manchester United appealed for a penalty kick when a cross from Giggs struck Cole, but replays showed that the ball hit the Arsenal full-back in the midriff. United sustained their attack, and the ball came to <b>Scholes</b> in the penalty area, but his shot on the turn was well saved by Lehmann. The resultant corner was taken short by <b>Scholes,</b> before it was played back to him; his cross found Van Nistelrooy unmarked in the area, but the Dutchman headed over the bar {{from the edge of the}} goal area. United then had another penalty shout when Giggs volleyed a long ball from <b>Scholes</b> into Touré's body and up onto the Ivorian's hand, but referee Rob Styles turned their claims down. Arsenal then brought on Edu to replace Pirès for the remaining 15 minutes.|$|E
5|$|United met Newcastle United in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium, the {{penultimate}} FA Cup final to be {{held there}} before it was closed for rebuilding.

5|$|United {{were drawn}} against fellow Premier League side Blackburn Rovers in the semi-final. The first leg at Old Trafford was goalless {{in the first}} half, but United {{took the lead in}} the 58th minute when midfielder Paul <b>Scholes</b> scored. However, three minutes later Blackburn {{equalised}} when David Thompson scored. The match finished at 1–1. The second leg held at Blackburn's home ground, Ewood Park, saw them take the lead when striker Andy Cole scored early in the match. However, United responded and two goals from <b>Scholes</b> in the remainder of the first half gave United the lead. They scored a third in the second half when striker Ruud van Nistelrooy converted a penalty. United won the match 3–1 and progressed to the final after winning the tie 4–2.|$|E

5|$|A year later, at {{the height}} of the 1975 Australian {{constitutional}} crisis, the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals. As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon <b>Scholes</b> appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, stating that she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general. The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{employed}} a traditional 4–4–2 formation: a four-man defence (comprising two centre-backs and {{left and right}} full-backs), four midfielders (two in the centre, and one on each wing) and two centre-forwards. Manchester United organised themselves slightly differently, with Paul <b>Scholes</b> playing ahead of the midfield in a supporting role behind the main striker, Andy Cole. The team lined up in a 4–4–1–1 formation.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{were missing}} defender Sol Campbell from their team {{after the death}} of his father, and manager Arsène Wenger dropped wingers Robert Pirès and Sylvain Wiltord in favour of Ray Parlour and Fredrik Ljungberg, {{creating}} a more physical midfield. Wenger's tactics worked, as the Arsenal defence withstood the pressure from the Manchester United attack. United themselves were without Paul <b>Scholes</b> due to injury, and they played a 4–3–2–1 formation with Phil Neville, Roy Keane and Quinton Fortune completing a defensively minded midfield.|$|E
