40|$|Abstract. Utilization {{of waste}} {{refractory}} material has {{attracted much attention}} due {{to the development of}} metallurgical industry and the requirements of environmental protection. This article mainly researched on the Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 -C <b>sliding</b> <b>nozzle</b> that prepared using its recovery refractory and some other new materials. The addition of the recovery material leads to the formation of ZrO 2 compound. The performance of the <b>sliding</b> <b>nozzle</b> is enhanced by controlling its microstructure, including the improvement of strength under cold and high temperature, and increase in slag resistance...|$|E
50|$|Nozzle {{extension}} — nozzle expander of reaction/rocket engine. The {{application of}} nozzle extensions improves efficiency of rocket engines in vacuum by increasing nozzle ratio. As a rule, their modern design assumes use of carbon-carbon materials without regenerative cooling. Along with <b>sliding</b> expanders, stationary <b>nozzle</b> extensions have some applications too.|$|R
40|$|The {{sliding gate}} plate that {{controls}} steel {{flow through the}} tundish nozzle sometimes cracks leading to air aspiration and safety concerns. To evaluate possible mechanisms for crack formation, this research applies a 3 -D finite-element model of the thermal and mechanical stress in a sliding-gate plate during preheating and casting induced by thermal expansion and/or mechanical movement. The thermal model is first validated with previous temperature histories measured during preheating and casting in a ladle plate. The model of a tundish <b>sliding</b> gate <b>nozzle</b> is then used to investigate thermal-mechanical behavior and cracking due to the temperature variations during preheating and casting. The model predictions of the maximum stress location and orientation match well with the crack location observed in used plates from POSCO. Different mechanisms {{for the formation of}} two different types of common through-thickness cracks are identified and explained. The first involves exterior tensile stress during heating stages, and the second is due to excessive compression from non-optimal placement of guide points on the steel cassette...|$|R
40|$|This {{report will}} give {{a review of the}} result of an {{experiment}} which is done to observe the distribution nature of particles when a pulse of Aerosol is injected onto a glass <b>slide</b> through a <b>nozzle</b> (The flow of Aerosol jet is a supersonic flow). 3 D graphical representation of distribution curve is plotted which is expected to be Gaussian in nature and a brief discussion about it is given. A description of cluster, how it can be ionized by a laser source and an introduction to ‘Time of flight’ is also given as it is a very important study for many spectroscopic experiment...|$|R
30|$|The {{morphology}} of the electrospun nanofibers {{was observed}} using {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) (JEOL JSM- 5600 LV, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 8 – 10  kV. Prior to imaging by SEM, samples were sputter coated with gold for 50  s to increase their conductivity. The nanofiber diameter was obtained from at least 50 measurements on a typical SEM image using Image J 1.40  G software (NIH, USA). Further examination of nanofiber fluorescence was performed on Olympus BX 51 fluorescence microscope. The nanofiber samples were prepared by collecting nanofibers on a glass <b>slide</b> under electrospinning <b>nozzle</b> for 1  min and then captured using Olympus DP 72 camera equipped with Olympus CellSens software. A Nicolet-Nexus 670 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to obtain the FTIR spectra of the electrospun nanofibers over a range of 500 – 4000  cm− 1 at a scanning resolution of 2  cm− 1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy was carried out on a Rigaku D/max 2550 PC (Rigaku Inc., Japan) with Cu Kα radiation. The operating voltage and current were kept at 40  kV and 300  mA, respectively. The electrospun nanofiber samples were examined between 0 and 60 ° (2 θ) at a scanning rate of 1 ° (2 θ) per minute.|$|R
