5|$|In some cases, danger listing {{has sparked}} {{conservation}} efforts and prompted {{the release of}} funds, resulting in a positive development for sites such as the Galápagos Islands and Yellowstone National Park, {{both of which have}} subsequently been removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger. Despite this, the list itself and UNESCO's implementation of it have been the focus of criticism. In particular, <b>States</b> <b>Parties</b> and other stakeholders of World Heritage Sites have questioned the authority of the Committee to declare a site in danger without their consent. Until 1992, when UNESCO set a precedent by placing several sites on the danger list against their wishes, <b>States</b> <b>Parties</b> would have submitted a programme of corrective measures before a site could be listed. Instead of being used as intended, the List of World Heritage in Danger is perceived by some states as a black list and according to Christina Cameron, Professor at the School of Architecture, Canada Research Chair on Built Heritage, University of Montreal, has been used as political tool {{to get the attention of}} <b>States</b> <b>Parties.</b> The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) notes that UNESCO has referenced the List of World Heritage in Danger (without actually listing the site) in a number of cases where the threat could be easily addressed by the State Party. The Union also argues that keeping a site listed as endangered over a long period is questionable and that other mechanisms for conservation should be sought in these cases.|$|E

In 1874 he was elected as president of the Permanent Commission of the European Arc Measurement. He also presided the General Conference of the European Arc Measurement held in Paris in 1875, when the association decided the creation of an international geodetic standard for the bases' measurement. He represented Spain at the 1875 conference of the Metre Convention, which was ratified the same year in Paris. The Spanish geodesist was elected as the first president of the International Committee for Weights and Measures. His activities resulted in the distribution of a platinum and iridium prototype of the metre to all <b>States</b> <b>parties</b> to the Metre Convention during the first meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1889. Theses prototypes defined the metre right up until 1960.|$|E

40|$|Objective. This article {{examines}} <b>state</b> <b>party</b> activity {{in support of}} U. S. Senate candidates during the 2000 election. The literature on the service role of parties suggests that national parties will be active in support of candidates, while <b>state</b> <b>parties</b> will be inclined to provide mobilization services. However, <b>state</b> <b>parties</b> are also {{in a good position}} to provide campaign contributions and technical services usually supplied by national party organizations. Methods. Focusing on the 2000 elections, I use campaign finance data from the Federal Election Commission as well as original data derived from a survey of the <b>state</b> <b>parties</b> to investigate the relationship between <b>state</b> <b>parties</b> and U. S. Senate candidates. Results. The results indicate not only that <b>state</b> <b>parties</b> were remarkably active in support of U. S. Senate candidates, but also that Republican <b>state</b> <b>parties</b> appeared to better target their support to more deserving candidates than did Democratic <b>state</b> <b>parties.</b> Closer scrutiny, however, reveals that the Democrats, by using <b>state</b> <b>party</b> organizations as the conduit of coordinated expenditures, were more successful in providing resources to candidates who would win. Conclusions. Although much of the activity of <b>state</b> <b>party</b> organizations is explained by money transfers from national party organizations, it is the transfer of hard money that accounts for <b>state</b> <b>party</b> activity in U. S. Senate campaigns. This brings into question the impact of recent campaign finance reforms on the relationship between <b>state</b> <b>parties</b> and U. S. Senate candidates...|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} NGOs {{and human rights}} organisations have criticised the PRC government for failing {{to comply with the}} UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, accusing PRC of penalising and abusing lower tier prostitutes, many of whom are victims of human trafficking, while exonerating men who buy sex, and ignoring the ongoing problems of governmental complicity and involvement in the sex trade industry. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women reads: Art. 6: <b>States</b> <b>Parties</b> shall take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women. However, it does not advocate a system of legal and regulated prostitution. There has, though, been some calls for legalization; a minor rally for this caused was held in 2010 organized by sex worker activist Ye Haiyan, who was arrested by police for her role in organizing the protests.|$|E
25|$|In April 1959 Iran {{altered the}} legal status of the strait by {{expanding}} its territorial sea to 12-nautical-mile (22km) and declaring that it would recognize only transit by innocent passage through the newly expanded area. In July 1972, Oman expanded its territorial sea to 12nm by decree. Thus, by mid-1972, the Strait of Hormuz was completely “closed” by the combined territorial waters of Iran and Oman. During the 1970s, neither Iran or Oman attempted to impede the passage of warships through the strait, but in the 1980s, both countries asserted claims that were different with customary (old) law. Upon ratifying UNCLOS in August 1989, Oman submitted declarations confirming its 1981 royal decree that only innocent passage is permitted through its territorial sea. The declarations further asserted that prior permission was required before foreign warships could pass through Omani territorial waters. Upon signing the convention in December 1982, Iran entered a declaration stating “that only <b>states</b> <b>parties</b> to the Law of the Sea Convention shall be entitled to benefit from the contractual rights created therein”, including “the right of transit passage through straits used for international navigation”. In May 1993, Iran enacted a comprehensive law on maritime areas, several provisions of which conflict with UNCLOS provisions, including a requirement that warships, submarines, and nuclear-powered ships obtain permission before exercising innocent passage through Iran’s territorial waters.The United States does not recognize any of the claims by Oman and Iran and has contested each of them.|$|E

This study uses party platforms to assess the degree of independence between state and national political parties in the United States in light of issue ownership theory and morality politics. Utilizing a coding scheme adapted from the Comparative Manifesto Project, I analyze the ideology and content of 80 Democratic and Republican <b>state</b> <b>party</b> platforms from 2008 - 2010. I uncover substantial variations among <b>state</b> <b>party</b> platforms and findings suggest that <b>state</b> <b>parties</b> manage to maintain a significant level of independence from the national parties. Some of the findings suggest our current understanding of <b>state</b> <b>party</b> politics is inadequate. For example, contrary to expectations, Republican <b>state</b> <b>party</b> platforms show more ideological variation than their Democratic counterparts. In contrast to national patterns, Democratic <b>state</b> <b>party</b> platforms conform more consistently with issue ownership theory than their Republican counterparts. And Democratic <b>state</b> <b>party</b> platforms are significantly more likely to balance their progressive policy preferences with conservative party interests...|$|R
