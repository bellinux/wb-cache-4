5|$|In {{addition}} to their striking, superficial similarity to contemporary shrimp, Waptia fieldensis were also very shrimp-like in their habits. They were bottom-dwelling (nektobenthic) deposit feeders. The lack of strong feeding appendages indicates {{that they were more}} likely to feed by <b>sifting</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sea bottom for edible organic particles. Their tails and the feather-like filaments on their posterior thoracic somites also imply that they were active swimmers.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire was}} fed not merely by wood, fabrics, and thatch, Hanson points out, {{but also by}} the oil, pitch, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, turpentine, and {{gunpowder}} stored in the riverside district. It melted the imported steel lying along the wharves (melting point between 1,250 and 1,480°C (2,300 and 2,700°F)) and the great iron chains and locks on the City gates (melting point between 1,100 and 1,650°C (2,000 and 3000°F)).

500|$|With Achtung Baby, {{the group}} sought to recover {{some of the}} Dadaist {{characters}} and stage antics they had dabbled with in the late 1970s as teenagers. U2 had abandoned these ideas for more literal themes in the 1980s. However, for the new album, the band was interested in no longer making obvious sense. Accordingly, the lyrics for [...] "Zoo Station" [...] were inspired by the surrealism of a story about Berlin during World War II that Bono heard. Animals escaped the city's zoo after it was damaged in overnight bombing, and as a result, rhinoceroses, pelicans and flamingoes wandered around the next morning while people were <b>sifting</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> rubble. Bono was also inspired by Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station, also known as [...] "Zoo station", previously the main railway station in West Berlin. The station was notorious as a haunt for drug dealers, prostitutes and pimps, pick-pockets and transients, particularly prior to German reunification, when it was run by the East German railway. He compared the song to the station, saying [...] "it was written as an opening track, the beasts breaking out of their cages", and was interested in using the zoo as a metaphor and he took further inspiration from the subway station representing Europe at a crossroads.|$|E

Equipment and resources from over a dozen nearby fire departments aided in <b>sifting</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> remains of dozens of houses. More than 675 volunteers, coordinated by the Virginia faith-based nonprofit organization Operation Blessing, and countless residents from surrounding areas assisted in cleanup efforts. AmeriCorps coordinated their own operations beginning on April12. Switchyard Bar and Grill in Rochelle hosted a donation drive to provide victims with new household items. Ogle County Sheriff Brian VanVickle and DeKalb County Sheriff Roger Scott set up a lost-and-found for residents to retrieve missing items. Workers from [...] "Bees Designs" [...] created and sold shirts in Rochelle, with all proceeds donated to help tornado victims. A check from near Rochelle was discovered approximately 80mi (130km) northeast in Racine, Wisconsin, a common occurrence with violent tornadoes. Widespread severe weather across northern Illinois prompted the cancellation of more than 850 flights at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Governor Bruce Rauner declared DeKalb and Ogle counties as state disaster areas, freeing up a wide variety of resources for response efforts. Both the governor and Illinois U.S. Senator Mark Kirk toured the area. Total economic losses from the tornado reached $19 million (2015 USD).|$|E

60|$|No {{command to}} fall back was given, none could have been heard. Man by man, the {{survivors}} withdrew at will, <b>sifting</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> trees into {{the cover of the}} ravines, among the wounded who could drag themselves back; among the skulkers whom nothing could have dragged forward. The left of our short line had fought at the corner of a cornfield, the fence along the right side of which was parallel to the direction of our retreat. As the disorganized groups fell back along this fence on the wooded side, they were attacked by a flanking force of the enemy moving through the field in a direction nearly parallel with what had been our front. This force, I infer from General Johnston's account, consisted of the brigade of General Lowry, or two Arkansas regiments under Colonel Baucum. I had been sent by General Hazen to that point and arrived in time to witness this formidable movement. But already our retreating men, in obedience to their officers, their courage and their instinct of self-preservation, had formed along the fence and opened fire. The apparently slight advantage of the imperfect cover and the open range worked its customary miracle: the assault, a singularly spiritless one, considering the advantages it promised and that it was made by an organized and victorious force against a broken and retreating one, was checked. The assailants actually retired, and if they afterward renewed the movement they encountered none but our dead and wounded.|$|E
