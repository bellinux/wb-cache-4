50|$|Sanitary and {{phytosanitary}} (<b>SPS)</b> <b>measures</b> are {{measures to}} protect humans, animals, and plants from diseases, pests, or contaminants. The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures {{is one of the}} final documents approved {{at the conclusion of the}} Uruguay Round of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. It applies to all sanitary (relating to animals) and phytosanitary (relating to plants) (<b>SPS)</b> <b>measures</b> that may have a direct or indirect impact on international trade. The SPS agreement includes a series of understandings (trade disciplines) on how <b>SPS</b> <b>measures</b> will be established and used by countries when they establish, revise, or apply their domestic laws and regulations. Countries agree to base their SPS standards on science, and as guidance for their actions, the agreement encourages countries to use standards set by international standard setting organizations. The SPS agreement seeks to ensure that <b>SPS</b> <b>measures</b> will not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against trade of certain other members nor be used to disguise trade restrictions. In this SPS agreement, countries maintain the sovereign right to provide the level of health protection they deem appropriate, but agree that this right will not be misused for protectionist purposes nor result in unnecessary trade barriers. A rule of equivalency rather than equality applies to the use of <b>SPS</b> <b>measures.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{critical}} {{feature of}} the SPS Agreement is that Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures (“SPS measures”) {{must be based on}} a ‘risk assessment’. Article 2.2 of the SPS Agreement requires <b>SPS</b> <b>measures</b> to be maintained with sufficient scientific evidence. Furthermore, <b>SPS</b> <b>measures</b> must be based on appropriate assessments of the risks to human, animal or plant life or health. The risk assessment must, but is not limited to, consider: scientific evidence, relevant processes and production methods, relevant inspection, sampling and testing methods, prevalence of specific diseases or pests, existence of pest or disease free areas, relevant ecological and environmental conditions, and quarantine or other treatment. Exceptionally, Members may adopt provisional measures (not based on a risk assessment) when the relevant scientific evidence is insufficient.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveSince {{patients}} with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) are at high-risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, preventive measures aimed to reduce cardiovascular adverse events are advocated {{in the current}} guidelines. We conducted a systematic review to assess the implementation of secondary prevention (<b>SP)</b> <b>measures</b> in PAOD patients. MethodsPubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched to perform a systematic {{review of the literature}} from 1999 till June 2008 on SP for PAOD patients. Assessment of study quality was done following the Cochrane Library review system. The record outcomes were antiplatelet agents, heart rate lowering agents, blood pressure lowering agents, lipid lowering agents, glucose lowering agents, smoking cessation and walking exercise. ResultsFrom a total of 2137 identified studies, 83 observational studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 24 were included in the systematic review comprising 34 157 patients. These patients suffered from coronary artery disease (n= 3516, 41 %), myocardial infraction (n= 2647, 38 %), angina pectoris (n= 1790, 31 %), congestive heart failure (n= 2052, 14 %), diabetes mellitus (n= 10 690, 31 %),hypertension (n= 20 823, 73 %) and hyperlipidaemia (n= 15 067, 64 %). Contrary to what the guidelines prescribe, antiplatelet agents, heart rate lowering agents, blood pressure lowering agents and lipid lowering agents were prescribed in 63 %, 34 %, 46 % and 45 % of the patients, respectively. Glucose lowering agents were prescribed in 81 % and smoking cessation in 39 % of the patients.

40|$|Integrated {{geophysical}} surveys using vertical electrical sounding (VES), {{very low}} frequency (VLF) EM, radiation counting, total magnetic field and self-potential (SP) measurements are carried out to characterize the geothermal area around a hot spring in the Nayagarh district, Orissa, India that lies in the East Indian geothermal province. The study was performed to delineate the fracture pattern, contaminated groundwater movement and possible heating source. VES interpretations suggest a three- to four-layer structure in the area. Resistivity survey near the hot spring suggests that weathered and fractured formations constitute the main aquifer system and extend to 60 m depth. Current flow measured at various electrode separations normalized by the applied voltage suggests that fractures extend to a greater depth. Detailed VLF study shows that fractures extend beyond 70 m depth. VLF anomaly has also very good correlation with the total magnetic field measured along the same profiles. Study results suggest that a gridded pattern of VLF survey could map the underground conductive fracture zones that can identify the movement of contaminated groundwater flow. Therefore, precautionary measures {{can be taken to}} check further contamination by delineating subsurface conducting structures. Self potential (<b>SP)</b> <b>measured</b> over the hot spring does not show a large anomaly in favor of the presence of a sulphide mineral body. A small positive (5 – 15 mV) <b>SP</b> anomaly is <b>measured</b> which may be streaming potential due to subsurface fluid flow.
