5000|$|Three {{techniques}} {{have been designed}} for protecting DAS and BDAS systems from <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> attacks: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} security, <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> {{is a type}} {{of social}} engineering technique used to obtain information such as personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords and other confidential data by looking over the victim's shoulder. This attack can be performed either at close range (by directly looking over the victim's shoulder) or from a longer range by, for example by using a pair of binoculars or similar hardware. To implement this technique attackers do not require any technical skills; keen observation of victims' surroundings and the typing pattern is sufficient. Crowded places are the more likely areas for an attacker to shoulder surf the victim. In the early 1980s, <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> was practiced near public pay phones to steal calling card digits and make long distance calls or sell them in the market for the cheaper prices. However, the advent of modern-day technologies like hidden cameras and secret microphones makes <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> easier and gives more scope for the attacker to perform long range <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing.</b> A hidden camera allows the attacker to capture whole login process and other confidential data of the victim, which ultimately could lead to financial loss or identity theft.|$|E
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to prevent criminals from <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> the customer's {{personal}} identification number (PIN), some banks draw privacy areas on the floor.|$|E
50|$|Personal {{identification}} number {{is used to}} authenticate oneself in various situations, while withdrawing or depositing the money from automatic teller machine, unlock a phone, door, laptop or PDA. Though this method of authentication is a two step verification process in some situations, it is vulnerable to <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> attack. An attacker can obtain the PIN either by directly looking over the victim's shoulder or by recording the whole login process. So, various <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> resistant PIN entry methodologies are proposed to make the authentication process secure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{use of an}} {{on-screen}} keyboard {{on which}} the user [...] "types" [...] with mouse clicks can {{increase the risk of}} password disclosure by <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing,</b> because: ...|$|E
5000|$|... <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> {{refers to}} using direct {{observation}} techniques, such as looking over someone's shoulder, to get information. It {{is commonly used}} to obtain passwords, PINs, security codes, and similar data.|$|E
50|$|POS {{terminals}} often {{available in}} shops, supermarkets, and filling stations {{are more difficult}} to use in a way that prevents <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> as they are often located in exposed view on counters.|$|E
5000|$|In 1984, Gold and {{a fellow}} {{journalist}} Robert Schifreen demonstrated an [...] "ad hoc penetration test" [...] of a Prestel network which, according to the writer Nick Barron, used [...] "a combination of clever <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> and good old-fashioned hacking skills".|$|E
5000|$|S. Rajarajan, M. Prabhu, and S. Palanivel praised PassMap {{for having}} [...] "good memorability {{due to the}} usage of map for the {{password}} mechanism". But they noted that like many graphical passwords, PassMap is susceptible to a <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> intrusion.|$|E
50|$|The {{cognitive}} trapdoor {{game has}} three groups involved in it: a machine verifier, a human prover, and a human observer. The goal {{of each group}} is, human prover has to input the PIN by answering the questions posed by the machine verifier while the observer tries to observe {{the interaction between the}} machine verifier and the human prover to know the PIN. A token is assigned to the prover as a unique identification by an authentic channel to prove his/her own identity. As the prover needs to authenticate themself in it is not easy for the observer to remember the whole login process unless the observer had a recording device. The cognitive trapdoor mechanism is resistant to direct <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> but not against the recording <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing.</b>|$|E
50|$|By {{asking the}} user to enter only a few {{specific}} characters from their password, rather than the whole password, partial passwords help to protect the user from password theft. As {{only part of the}} password is revealed at once it becomes more difficult to obtain the password using techniques such as keystroke logging or <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Robert Schifreen and Stephen Gold, using {{conventional}} {{home computers}} and modems in late 1984 and early 1985, gained unauthorised access to British Telecom's Prestel interactive viewdata service. While at a trade show, Schifreen by doing what latterly {{became known as}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing,</b> had observed the password of a Prestel engineer: the username was 22222222 and the password was 1234. This later gave rise to subsequent accusations that BT had not taken security seriously. Armed with this information, the pair explored the system, even gaining access to the personal message box of Prince Philip.|$|E
50|$|The {{security}} of a password-protected system depends on several factors. The overall system must, of course, be designed for sound security, with protection against computer viruses, man-in-the-middle attacks and the like. Physical security issues are also a concern, from deterring <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> to more sophisticated physical threats such as video cameras and keyboard sniffers. And, of course, passwords should be chosen {{so that they are}} hard for an attacker to guess and hard for an attacker to discover using any (and all) of the available automatic attack schemes. See password strength and computer security.|$|E
5000|$|In surfing, <b>{{shoulder}}</b> <b>surfing</b> {{refers to}} shoulder hopping. Shoulder hoppers {{do not take}} off on the critical part of the wave {{where there is a}} need for a high level of skill, but take off further down the line. They are often regarded as annoying by more experienced surfers because shoulder hoppers will sometimes drop in on a surfer already riding the wave [...] - [...] which breaches surfing etiquette of [...] "first on wave (or, closest to the curl) has right of way". Southern California early eighties band the Surf Punks performed a song called Shoulder Hopper for their album My Beach.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> is {{more likely}} to perform in the crowded places because it is easy to observe the {{information}} without dragging the victim's attention. Various situations where an attacker can easily shoulder surf the victim are, while filling out a form(bank withdrawal, deposit form or a loan form), entering their PIN at an automated teller machine or an at a POS terminal, using their telephone card at a public payphone, entering their password at a cybercafe, public and university libraries, or airport kiosks, entering their code for a rented locker in a public place such as a swimming pool or airport, entering their PIN or password on their smartphone.|$|E
50|$|The {{main issue}} is that the {{contents}} of the password notification email can be easily discovered by anyone with access to the inbox of the account owner. This could be as a result of <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> or if the inbox itself is not password protected. The contents could then be used to compromise the security of the account. The user would therefore have the responsibility of either securely deleting the email or ensuring that its contents are not revealed to anyone else. A partial solution to this problem, is to cause any links contained within the email to expire after a period of time, making the email useless if it is not used quickly after it is sent.|$|E
50|$|Classified U.S. {{government}} documents typically must be stamped with their classification {{on the cover}} {{and at the top}} and bottom of each page. Authors must mark each paragraph, title and caption in a document with the highest level of information it contains, usually by placing appropriate initials in parentheses at the beginning of the paragraph, title, or caption. Commonly, one must affix a brightly colored cover sheet to the cover of each classified document to prevent unauthorized observation of classified material (<b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing)</b> and to remind users to lock up unattended documents. The most sensitive material requires two-person integrity, where two cleared individuals are responsible for the material at all times. Approved containers for such material have two separate combination locks, both of which must be opened to access the contents.|$|E
50|$|The {{awareness}} to the users {{at the public}} ATM can be provided while a <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> is occurring. Then a decision {{can be made by}} the user if the information he is entering in the public is sensitive and if it has to be hidden. Flashing border can be used to notify and alert the user. When a person enters the area near to the user, the borders of the machine flashes by alerting the user. It can even be detailed with colors. Like red color can be used if the person entered is looking towards the display and green when the person is still near that vicinity but not looking towards the display. Another way is creating a 3-D shadow on the display of the user peeping into the display.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} scam, the {{perpetrator}} will obtain the victim's PIN either by watching them enter {{it the first}} time (<b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing),</b> or by approaching the victim under the pretense of offering help and suggesting they re-enter their PIN (and again, watching them do so). More sophisticated variants of the Lebanese loop scam have developed. In some cases, the fraudsters attach a small camera to the ATM to record the victim entering their PIN. The video from this camera is then transmitted to the fraudsters, who may be waiting near the machine and viewing the video on a laptop computer, meaning they need not approach the victim directly. There have been cases where a fake keypad is fitted to the machine {{over the top of the}} real one, and this records the PINs entered.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a special}} type of purchase. The item or good is {{transferred}} as normal, but the purchaser uses a debit card instead of money to pay. A debit card contains an electronic record of the purchaser's account with a bank. Using this card, the seller is able to send an electronic signal to the buyer's bank {{for the amount of}} the purchase, and that amount of money is simultaneously debited from the customer's account and credited to the account of the seller. This is possible even if the buyer or seller use different financial institutions. Currently, fees to both the buyer and seller for the use of debit cards are fairly low because the banks want to encourage the use of debit cards. The seller must have a card reader set up in order for such purchases to be made. Debit cards allow a buyer to have access to all the funds in his account without having to carry the money around. It is more difficult to steal such funds than cash, but it is still done. See also skimming and <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A secured {{authentication}} {{system should be}} incorporated {{in order to protect}} secret information from sensitive and various applica-tions. The vulnerabilities of textual passwords are well known, such as short passwords are easy to remember, which makes the pass-words vulnerable for attackers to break and some passwords which cannot be easily guessed are often difficult to remember. <b>Shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> attack refers to using direct observation techniques, such as looking over someone’s shoulder to get some information such as password, etc. Hence an alternative solution to text based authentication is image based authentication. However image based authentica-tion is more vulnerable to <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> attack. In this paper, we propose an authentication scheme resistant to <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> attack using Image Retrieval. It seamlessly integrates both textual based and image based authentication schemes hence making more secure authentication. Using Image Retrieval user can choose their own choice of image as pass images and can increase password space. We have also discussed their effect on usability and security, which provides resistance to <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> attack.

40|$|Graphical {{passwords}} {{are often}} considered prone to shouldersurfing attacks, where attackers can steal a user‟s password by peeking over {{his or her}} shoulder in the authentication process. In this paper, we explore <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> defence for recall-based graphical password systems such as Draw-A-Secret and Background Draw-A-Secret, where users doodle their passwords (i. e. secrets) on a drawing grid. We propose three innovative <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> defence techniques, and conduct two separate controlled laboratory experiments to evaluate both security and usability perspectives of the proposed techniques. One technique was expected to work to some extent theoretically, {{but it turned out}} to provide little protection. One technique provided the best overall <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> defence, but also caused some usability challenges. The other technique achieved reasonable <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> defence and good usability simultaneously, a good balance which the two other techniques did not achieve.

40|$|Identity theft {{refers to}} the preparatory stage of {{acquiring}} and collecting someone else's personal information for criminal purposes. During the past few years, {{a very large number}} of people suffered adverse consequences of identity theft crimes. In this thesis, we investigate different methods and techniques that can be used to provide better protection against identity theft techniques that have some hi-tech relevance such as <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> of user's passwords and personal identification numbers (PINs), phishing and keylogging attacks. To address the <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> threat to traditional PIN entry schemes, two new PIN entry schemes are proposed. Both schemes achieve a good balance between security and usability. In addition, our analysis shows that these two schemes are resilient to <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing,</b> given that the attacker has a limited capability in recording the login process. We also propose a click-based graphical password authentication scheme. This scheme aims at improving the resistance to <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> attacks while maintaining the merits of the click-based authentication solutions. It is also resilient to <b>shoulder</b> <b>surfing</b> attacks even if the attacker can record the entire login process for one time with a video device. Finally, in order to defend against online phishing attacks, we present a framework to strengthen password authentication using mobile devices and browser extensions. The proposed authentication framework produces a different password depending on the domain name of the login site. Besides defending against phishing attacks, this solution does not require any modifications at the server sid...|$|E
