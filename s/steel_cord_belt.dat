Due to the steel cables imbedded in the conveyor belt, the pressure distribution between the belt and a conveyor idler roll is not uniform. The fluctuating pressure {{means that a}} two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model - which is suitable {{for the analysis of}} fabric belt - cannot be readily applied to the analysis of <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> <b>belt.</b> To cope with this problem, a static three dimensional finite element model was developed to determine the pressure distribution and reaction forces transmitted through the belt to the conveyor idler. The pressures determined by the finite element analysis are compared with experimental results found with the Tekscan pressure measurement system, and the reaction loads are used in the two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model developed by Wheeler [2]. The results from Wheeler's model are summed to determine an overall indentation rolling resistance for the <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> <b>belt...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pseudo {{three dimensional analysis}} to predict the indentation rolling resistance of belt conveyors. Conventional methods used to analyse the indentation rolling resistance problem typically assume a bottom cover of uniform thickness bonded to a rigid substrate with no consideration of the carcass properties. This work aims to analyse {{the influence of the}} carcass construction and configuration for steel cord conveyor belts and predict the influence on the indentation rolling resistance. Due to the presence of steel cords embedded in the conveyor belt, the pressure distribution at the interface between the belt and a conveyor idler roll is not uniform. To solve this problem, a static three dimensional finite element model was developed to determine the pressure distribution and reaction forces transmitted through the belt to the conveyor idler roll. The reaction loads are then used in a two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model to determine the indentation rolling resistance for the <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> <b>belt.</b> This paper investigates the influence of the conveyor belt carcass and bottom cover properties on the resulting stress distribution throughout the belt and consequently on the indentation rolling resistance. The influence of the steel cord diameter and pitch, applied load, bottom cover thickness and strain rate is investigated. A finite element method is detailed for the analysis of the stress distribution throughout the belt. A range of carcass configurations is investigated and experimental verification of the calculated stress distribution undertaken using a Tekscan™ pressure measurement system...|$|E

Because of <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> {{conveyor}} <b>belt</b> {{with high}} load operating and complex conditions of coal mine, it {{is prone to}} cause conveyor belt horizontal rupture.

Twelve time domain features of joints signals, broken wires signals and abrasion signals for <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> conveyor <b>belt</b> were extracted with weak magnetic detection system. The algorithm of combining rough set based on information entropy with multi-class SVMν − based on binary tree was proposed to classify the three categories signals.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the noise of a defect {{electromagnetic}} signal of the <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> conveyor <b>belt</b> used in coal mines, a new signal noise reduction method by combined use of the improved threshold wavelet and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is proposed. Firstly, the denoising method based on the improved threshold wavelet is applied to reduce the noise of a defect electromagnetic signal obtained by an electromagnetic testing system. Then, the EMD is used to decompose the denoised signal and then the effective Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) is extracted by the dominant eigenvalue strategy. Finally, the signal reconstruction is carried out by utilizing the obtained IMF. In order to verify the proposed noise reduction method, the experiments are carried out in two cases including the defective joint and steel wire rope break. The experimental results show that the proposed method in this paper obtains the higher Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for the defect electromagnetic signal noise reduction of <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> conveyor <b>belts...</b>|$|R
40|$|Belt {{conveying}} systems {{operating with}} <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> conveyor <b>belts</b> are used {{extensively in the}} mining and minerals processing industries to transport bulk material. An accurate analysis of the belt tension distribution {{along the length of}} the system is essential to ensure reliable and efficient operation. An important consideration in the tension analysis is the evaluation of the motion resistances of the system. The motion resistances that occur {{along the length of the}} conveyor are known as the main resistances and, for a horizontal conveyor include the belt and bulk solid flexure resistance, the rotational resistance of the idler rolls and the indentation rolling resistance of the conveyor belt. Generally, the indentation rolling resistance component is the major contributor to the motion resistance of long horizontal belt conveyors. This paper will discuss the development of a pseudo 3 -dimensional viscoelastic finite element analysis to calculate the indentation rolling resistance of <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> conveyor <b>belts.</b> A unique aspect of this model is the ability to incorporate into the viscoelastic rolling contact problem the influence of the <b>steel</b> <b>cords</b> and the variable rubber properties throughout the thickness of the belt. These parameters play a significant role in determining the contact pressure distribution at the belt and idler roll interface and the apparent bottom cover thickness, and therefore the indentation rolling resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{indentation}} {{rolling resistance}} of conveyor belts {{is an important}} design consideration for long belt conveyors and can also be important for heavily loaded belt conveyors.

40|$|Nowadays fiber {{reinforced}} polymers {{represent a}} well-established technique for structural retrofit of reinforced concrete structural members. However, the severe degradation of mechanical properties with temperature and fire conditions {{represents one of}} the weakest point of these systems. The use of a fire resistant inorganic resin, as geopolymers, instead of polymeric resins, would be highly desirable to overcome this issue. The present work is aimed at investigating the effectiveness of two different fiber reinforced geopolymer-based systems in strengthening of reinforced concrete beams. In particular, this paper presents the main outcomes of experimental flexural tests on shallow reinforced concrete beams strengthened with high strength <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> and carbon fiber reinforced geopolymers, cured at room temperature. No mechanical anchorage was employed to fix the composite to the concrete substrate. The mechanical behavior of the strengthened beams was evaluated by means of four-points bending tests.

50|$|The use of accelerators and {{activators}} {{lowers the}} activation energy of vulcanization reaction to 80-125kJ/Mole from 210kJ/Mole which is necessary {{if we use}} ‘Sulphur’ alone. Accelerators and activators break sulphur chains. Accelerated sulphur vulcanization systems require only 5-15 sulphur atoms per cross-link as compared to 40-45 S atoms/crosslink for a non-accelerated sulphur vulcanization.There are many accelerators available for the vulcanization of rubber. That is {{because there is a}} wide range of rubber articles on the market {{with a wide variety of}} properties. For instance in a car tire alone there can be already up to eight different rubber compounds, each with specific properties. For instance the tread in a typical passenger car tire consists of a mixture of SBR (styrene-butadiene rubber) and BR (butadiene rubber). This rubber should have high abrasion resistance and high grip on both dry and wet roads. The side wall of the tire should have a high flexibility, meaning that it should resist many flexings during the running of the tire without cracking. It consists normally of a mixture of natural rubber and butadiene rubber. Inside the tire there is a rubber compound with as major function the adhesion between rubber and the <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> of the <b>belt.</b> It typically consists of natural rubber with a very high sulfur level (up to 8 phr), to get a relatively stiff rubber, with sulfur promoting the adhesion with the <b>steel</b> <b>cord.</b> The basis of the tire is formed by the carcass, normally a mixture of NR (natural rubber), SBR and BR. It should have a very good adhesion to the polyester cord, used as reinforcement.And the inner side of the tire is formed by the inner liner, normally consisting of halogenated butyl rubber (IIR)For all these compounds with their different properties different accelerators and mixtures of accelerators have to be used to obtain the required properties.A vulcanization accelerator is typically used in combination with sulfur as the cross-linker, and with zinc oxide and stearic acid as activators. Other additives can be added too, but for the cross-linking reaction the abovementioned ones are the most important.The various types of rubber used in the various tire compounds all have different vulcanization characteristics, like speed of cure (cure is the crosslinking reaction) and extent of cure (the number of cross-links). A typical passenger car tire is vulcanized for 10 minutes at 170 degrees C. This means that all the different compounds have to be cured to their optimum state of cure in this same 10 minutes. This is the reason why a lot of different accelerators or mixtures thereof are used in the same tire.|$|R

High speed multi pass wet {{wire drawing}} {{has become very}} common for {{production}} of high carbon <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> because {{of the increase in}} customer demand and production rates in real industrial fields. Although the wet wire drawing is preformed at a high speed usually above 1000 m/min, greater speed is required to improve productivity.

The excessive temperature rise makes the wire more brittle and finally leads to wire breaks. In this study, the variations in wire temperature during wet wire drawing process were investigated.

40|$|Abstract. Five twisted <b>steel</b> fibers (<b>steel</b> <b>cord,</b> SC) {{are used}} to improve the post-cracking {{behavior}} of cement composites. In addition to these <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> macrofibers, microfibers {{are used to}} enhance the pre- and post-cracking strength and behavior. The three specific hybrid fiber blends pursued in this investigation are SC and polyethylene (PE), SC and polypropylene (PP) as well as SC and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers. The research results show that SC macrofibers with high ultimate strain, strength and bond stress can bridge the macrocracks in the matrix. Therefore, cement-based composites reinforced with SC fibers exhibit a pseudo-strain hardening in tension {{as a result of}} the formation of multiple cracks. The microfibers improved pre-peak mechanical performance, strength, and fracture process by delaying the formation of a macrocrack. The tensile strength, energy consumption capacity and ductility of SC macrofibers and high elastic modulus microfiber PE reinforced cement-based composites are tremendously improved compared to SC macrofibers with lower elastic modulus microfibers PVA and PP...|$|R

40|$|Externally Bonded (EB) {{composite}} materials {{are becoming a}} widespread solution for strengthening interventions on masonry buildings, even Cultural Heritage structures, due to several positive aspects mainly related to their high strength-to-weight ratio. In recent years, beside common epoxy-based Fibre-Reinforced Polymers (FRP), steel-based composites have been proposed: they are composed by unidirectional high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>cords</b> that can be coupled to either organic (Steel Reinforced Polymers, SRP) or inorganic (Steel Reinforced Grouts, SRG) matrices, {{in relation to their}} optimized spacing. The bond behaviour of all these EB composites has a strong influence over the effectiveness of interventions, since the detachment of reinforcements from the substrate generally represents the weaker failure mechanism. In order to improve this aspect, several anchorage devices have been proposed, being spikes, among them, one of the most suitable for masonry supports. Spikes are made of a bundle of fibres partly {{in the form of a}} bar, to be inserted and glued into a hole drilled in the substrate, and partly loose, to be spread and connected to reinforcement strips. Despite their importance also from a design point of view and considering the variety of shapes and materials, there are still few investigations in this field, being clear that both the spike-to-reinforcement and the spike-to-masonry connections need to be studied.
