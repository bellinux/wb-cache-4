5|$|The notable {{properties}} of germania (GeO2) are its high {{index of refraction}} and its low optical dispersion. These make it especially useful for wide-angle camera lenses, microscopy, and the core part of optical fibers. It has replaced titania as the dopant for <b>silica</b> <b>fiber,</b> eliminating the subsequent heat treatment that made the fibers brittle. At the end of 2002, the fiber optics industry consumed 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this is less than 10% of worldwide consumption. GeSbTe is a phase change material used for its optic properties, such as that used in rewritable DVDs.|$|E

25|$|Silica can {{be drawn}} into fibers at {{reasonably}} high temperatures, and has a fairly broad glass transformation range. One other advantage is that fusion splicing and cleaving of silica fibers is relatively effective. <b>Silica</b> <b>fiber</b> also has high mechanical strength against both pulling and even bending, provided that the fiber is not too thick and that the surfaces have been well prepared during processing. Even simple cleaving (breaking) of {{the ends of the}} fiber can provide nicely flat surfaces with acceptable optical quality. Silica is also relatively chemically inert. In particular, it is not hygroscopic (does not absorb water).|$|E
2500|$|Doped fiber {{amplifiers}} (DFAs) are optical amplifiers {{that use}} a doped optical fiber as a gain medium to amplify an optical signal. They {{are related to}} fiber lasers. [...] The signal to be amplified and a pump laser are multiplexed into the doped fiber, and the signal is amplified through interaction with the doping ions. The most common example is the Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA), where {{the core of a}} <b>silica</b> <b>fiber</b> is doped with trivalent erbium ions and can be efficiently pumped with a laser at a wavelength of 980 nm or 1,480nm, and exhibits gain in the 1,550nm region.|$|E
50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and fiber optics, a plastic-clad <b>silica</b> <b>fiber</b> or polymer-clad <b>silica</b> <b>fiber</b> (PCS) is an optical fiber {{that has a}} silica-based core and a plastic cladding.
