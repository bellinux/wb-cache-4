30|$|McPherron (2016) {{describes}} {{the relation of}} the magnetospheric <b>sub-storm</b> (MS) to the <b>sub-storm</b> current wedge (SCW). MS is an organized sequence of events seen in the aurora near midnight. The most dramatic feature of MS is the sudden brightening and poleward expansion of the aurora tied to the dynamics in the geomagnetic tail. Intimately associated with this expansion is a westward electrical current flowing across the bulge of expanding aurora. This current is fed by a downward field-aligned current (FAC) at its eastern edge and an upward current at its western edge. This current system is called the SCW, which forms within a minute of auroral expansion. McPherron illustrates the involved scenario with a complex <b>sub-storm</b> and discusses some of the associated problems that are still not understood.|$|E
30|$|Nose (2016) {{studies the}} {{long-term}} {{variations in the}} plasma sheet ion composition and <b>sub-storm</b> occurrence over 23  years using the energetic ion flux (9.4 – 212  keV/e) data measured using Geotail satellite and <b>sub-storm</b> occurrences evaluated {{from the number of}} Pi 2 pulsations detected at the Kakioka observatory. The results show that the plasma ion mass (M) is ~ 1.1  amu during solar minimum and increases to 1.5 – 2.7 amu during solar maximum. The study using the unprecedentedly long dataset covering ~ 23  years provides additional observational evidence that heavy ions work to prevent the occurrence of sub-storms.|$|E
30|$|The steady plasma {{convection}} in the high-latitude ionospheres {{is frequently}} disturbed, {{especially on the}} nightside of the globe. The reason is a phenomenon known as a magnetospheric <b>sub-storm</b> (Akasofu 1964). Magnetospheric sub-storms begin with a growth phase, when {{a part of the}} energy derived from the solar wind is stored in the magnetotail. The energy is a consequence of effective coupling between the IMF carried by the solar wind and the Earth’s magnetic field; this process is most efficient when the IMF has a southward component. The expansion phase of the magnetospheric <b>sub-storm</b> explosively releases the stored energy causing large-scale changes in the magnetosphere {{as well as in the}} ionosphere: particle acceleration and precipitation, fast plasma flows, enhanced field-aligned currents, enhanced ionospheric electrojets, and spectacular auroral displays. During the expansion phase, intense and time-varying electric fields and currents exist in the ionosphere and those can cause power grid blackouts and damage to transformers. The whole duration of a <b>sub-storm,</b> including growth, expansion, and recovery phases, is typically a couple of hours.|$|E
50|$|A typical radio aurora {{occurs in}} the afternoon, which {{produces}} strong and distorted signals for few hours. The local midnight <b>sub-storming</b> usually produces weaker signals, but with less distortion by Doppler from gyrating electrons.|$|R
30|$|Whether {{we really}} need to place magnetometers closer than 100 km apart is largely a moot point since {{existing}} networks have a vastly greater average spacing than this. Many of the fine-scale variations are associated with <b>sub-storms,</b> which we maintain cannot be adequately characterized from the ground with existing networks. Improving this situation within reasonable budget constraints has been a primary motivating factor in our development of low-cost magnetometers.|$|R
30|$|During magnetospheric <b>sub-storms</b> and {{magnetic}} storms, the auroral oval is wide and aurora {{can be seen}} even at mid-latitudes. However, auroras are present continuously and the auroral oval in the nightside ionosphere is {{most of the time}} located within northern Scandinavia. Since this area contains a lot of different kinds of ground-based instrumentation including auroral cameras (e.g. ALIS and MIRACLE networks) and photometers, magnetometers, riometers, tomographic satellite receivers, etc., it represents a unique location on the globe. In addition, two rocket launch sites (Esrange and Andøya) are located in the area.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Multi-instrument {{observations}} {{of a small}} <b>sub-storm</b> event on 9 October 2000 provide, with high time reso-lution, two-dimensional information about substorm dynam-ics. A sequence of three optical intensifications, each as-sociated with a Pi 2 burst, were found, in which the third auroral intensification marked the onset of a small <b>sub-storm.</b> All three intensifications originated close to mid-night, but evolved progressively eastward. Within {{each of the three}} optical intensifications, a few azimuthally-spaced patches appeared, the first one near midnight and the sub-sequent patches successively eastward in the postmidnight sector, providing evidence for drift wave activity in the near-geosynchronous-orbit plasma sheet (NGOPS). The Super-DARN measurements reveal the development of eastward electric fields at NGOPS latitude within each Pi 2 burst in-terval. These observations can be interpreted as supporting the drift-Alfvén-ballooning (DAB) mode instability and its role in substorm expansion at NGOPS...|$|E
30|$|We {{observed}} eight Pi 2 {{events at}} KAK on 26 October 1997, 1100 – 1600 UT. Five {{of them had}} no significant <b>sub-storm</b> signatures (called pseudo-substorm Pi 2 s) as shown in Figs. 2 and 5, and other three events were associated with substorm onsets/intensifications. Since there were no bay signatures for the pseudo-substorm Pi 2 s, they did not originate from an oscillation of currents flowing on the substorm current wedge.|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to remember that at high latitudes all ionosondes are subject to several rather severe limitations during space weather events such as, magnetic storms and <b>sub-storms</b> and associated auroral and polar absorption, auroral events, spread F conditions and sporadic E layer effects which can produce a blanketing of the signal trace. For this reason it is particularly important for the ionospheric data to be manually edited prior to use. The KEL Aerospace ionosonde does not allow automatic scaling of the ionograms, and therefore, all data used in this analysis was selected to be quality and manually scaled. For this reason we have included in our analysis only data from San Martin station.|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} field sources inside the Earth {{play an important}} role in determining the long-term patterns in space weather and influence the {{magnetic field}} variations from sources external to the Earth. For example, current systems in the auroral region, which produce large magnetic disturbances during <b>sub-storms,</b> are strongly ordered by the Earth's main magnetic field which are connected via that field to interactions with the solar wind high in the magnetosphere. It has been known for some time that geodynamo processes in the Earth's fluid outer core result in changes in the magnetic field, known as secular variation, that are most visible on decadal and longer time-scales. Observatory measurements over the past two centuries suggest the dipole moment has decreased by over 10...|$|R
40|$|Summary. In paper I of {{this series}} (Hughes & Rostoker) we have {{presented}} a composite model three-dimensional current system whose magnetic perturbation pattern is in good agreement with that observed at high latitudes during periods of moderate magnetospheric activity. In this paper we extend the model current system to demonstrate its ability to reproduce the magnetic perturbation pattern associated with the magnetospheric <b>sub-storms.</b> In agreement with previous workers, we {{find it necessary to}} include a region of intense equatorward current flow at {{the western edge of the}} west-ward travelling surge. For the particular substorm event presented in this paper, we find that the main eastward and westward electrojets intensified slightly before the appearance of the surge form, and we are able to evaluate quantitatively the amount of change involved...|$|R
30|$|The {{question}} of which processes control these very dynamic releases of stored {{energy in the}} magnetotail continues to be controversial. It has been unclear whether a <b>sub-storm</b> starts {{with the formation of}} the near-Earth neutral line (NENL) in the magnetotail at 20 – 30  Re or by a disruption of cross-tail current in the near-Earth magnetotail at 10  Re (e.g. Angelopoulos et al. 2008) and whether the triggering mechanism is internal to the magnetosphere or externally controlled, e.g. by variations in the solar wind properties. It is not known what effect the state of the magnetosphere has in producing a particular response mode (e.g. <b>sub-storm,</b> pseudobreakup, or steady magnetospheric convection). Mass loading of the plasma sheet by ionospheric oxygen may have a dramatic effect in the tail, and eventually on the dayside, when convection transports plasma to the dayside reconnection region (McPherron et al. 2008). It has also been suggested that ionospheric conductivities could {{play an important role in}} allowing the currents to close via the ionosphere. In addition, the whole nature of reconnection of magnetic field lines in space plasmas is a subject of intense theoretical and observational research (e.g. Eastwood et al. 2010).|$|E
30|$|A {{theoretical}} {{approach to the}} study of the ballooning instability is based on a complicated system of coupled equations for the poloidal Alfven waves and slow magnetosonic (SMS) modes in a finite-pressure plasma, immersed in a curved magnetic field B (e.g., Southwood and Saunders, 1985; Walker, 1987; Hameiri et al., 1991; Klimushkin and Mager, 2008). Favorable conditions for the instability growth emerge at a steep plasma pressure drop held by curved field lines. Such a condition may occur before <b>sub-storm</b> onset on strongly extended field lines.|$|E
30|$|An intense PiB burst was {{observed}} at 0920 – 1300 UT at ATH at a frequency range below 1 Hz, indicating <b>sub-storm</b> activity. In fact, the provisional AE index provided by WDC-C 2 for geomagnetism at Kyoto University indicates that substorms took place at 0910 UT and 1215 UT with peak AE indices of ∼ 600 nT and ∼ 900 nT, respectively. At 1000 – 1030 UT, a clear enhancement of the power spectral density (PSD) {{was observed}} at MGD, PTK, and MSR at a frequency range of 0.1 – 2 Hz. Since the peak frequency tends to increase with time, {{it is likely that}} this Pc 1 pulsation event corresponds to the intervals of pulsations of diminishing periods (IPDP) associated with the EMIC waves generated by ring current ions in the magnetospheric equatorial plane, which are in turn associated with the <b>sub-storm</b> at 0910 UT (e.g., Kangas et al., 1998 and references therein). The corresponding enhancement of the PSD can also be recognized at STA in the same interval at 1000 – 1030 UT, albeit with weaker intensity, even though the data at STA are affected by strong broadband noise at 1 – 10 Hz. The spectra at PTK are also affected by spiky noise, probably from nearby facilities in the observatory.|$|E
30|$|Mainly through {{fieldwork}} {{performed by}} the University of California (Berkeley and Los Angeles) and the University of Calgary, the NASA THEMIS mission emplaced two magnetic networks known as the Ground Based Observatory (GBO) and Geomagnetic Event Observation Network by Students (GEONS). The latter involves a dozen high schools across the United States as part the Education and Public Outreach (E/PO) effort of the current THEMIS mission to study the birth and evolution of <b>sub-storms</b> (Angelopoulos, 2008). Ten GEONS magnetometers were located at high schools within the United States, contributing magnetic data for the mission as well as educating students and the public about geomagnetism, space weather, the aurora and the THEMIS mission (Peticolas et al., 2008). Both GEONS and the THEMIS GBO network use the aforementioned UCLA THEMIS-GBO flux-gate magnetometer, each supported by a networked PC that transmits data in real-time data and also archives it locally to hard drive.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{interpretation}} of the observed field-aligned acceleration events measured by GEOS- 2 near the night-side synchronous orbit at substorm onsets (Chen et al., 2000). We show that field-aligned acceleration of ions (with pitch angle asymmetry) is closely related to strong short-lived electric fields in the Ey direction. The acceleration is associated with either rapid dipolarization or further stretching of local magnetic field lines. Theoretical analysis suggests that a centrifugal mechanism is a likely candidate for the parallel energization. Equatorward or anti-equatorward energization occurs when the tail current sheet is thinner tailward or earthward of the spacecraft, respectively. The magnetic field topology leading to anti-equatorward energization corresponds to a situation where the near-Earth tail undergoes further compression and the inner edge of the plasma sheet extends inwards as close as the night-side geosynchronous altitudes.

40|$|Abstract The THEMIS mission {{provides}} unprecedented multi-point {{observations of}} the magnetosphere in conjunction with an equally unprecedented dense network of ground measurements. However, coverage of the magnetosphere is still sparse. In order to tie to-gether the THEMIS observations and to understand the data better, we will use the Open Geospace General Circulation Model (OpenGGCM), a global model of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. OpenGGCM solves the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the outer magnetosphere and couples via field aligned current (FAC), electric potential, and electron precipitation to a ionosphere potential solver and the Coupled Thermosphere Ionosphere Model (CTIM). The OpenGGCM thus provides a global comprehensive view of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. An OpenGGCM simulation {{of one of the}} first <b>sub-storms</b> observed by THEMIS on 23 March 2007 shows that the OpenGGCM reproduces the observed substorm signatures very well, thus laying the groundwork for future use of the OpenGGCM to aid in understanding THEMIS data and ultimately contributing to a com-prehensive model of the substorm process...|$|R
30|$|Solar {{terrestrial}} (ST) sciences started {{centuries ago}} and branched into different disciplines. Starting with naked eye to highly sophisticated novel experimental techniques, observations have revealed {{the secrets of}} the Sun, heliosphere, magnetosphere, plasmasphere, and ionosphere-atmosphere components of the ST system. Theories and theoretical models have been developed for the different components independently and together. World-wide efforts under different umbrella are being persuaded to understand the challenges of the ST system. The onset problem and role of O+ ions in <b>sub-storm</b> physics are two issues that are hotly debated. The onset problem is whether <b>sub-storm</b> is triggered by magnetic reconnection in the tail region at 15 – 20 Re or by a current disruption at ~ 12 Re. The issue on O+ role is whether O+ ions affect the dynamics of sub-storms under magnetic storm and non-storm conditions differently. This special issue of Geoscience Letters contains a collection of 15 papers on the history and development of solar terrestrial sciences including auroral sub-storms. Over half of the papers are based on the presentations in a session on the same topic organized at the AOGS (Asia Oceania geosciences Society) General Assembly held in Singapore during 02 – 07 August 2015. The rest of the papers from outside the assembly also falls within the theme of the special issue. The papers are organized in the order of history and development of ST coupling, sub-storms, and outer heliosphere.|$|E

The models use the classical notion of exterior and interior process, respectively for the variation of rainfall intensity at (approximately) storm and <b>sub-storm</b> scales. The exterior process is non-scaling and differs in the three models, whereas the interior process is stationary multifractal in all cases. The model-based IDF curves are robust, against outliers and {{can be obtained from}} only very few years of rainfall data.

25|$|Intense {{columns of}} Auroral {{ionization}} at 100km altitudes within the auroral oval backscatter radio waves, including those on HF and VHF. Backscatter is angle-sensitive—incident ray vs. magnetic field {{line of the}} column must be very close to right-angle. Random motions of electrons spiraling around the field lines create a Doppler-spread that broadens the spectra of the emission to more or less noise-likedepending on how high radio frequency is used. The radio-auroras are observed mostly at high latitudes and rarely extend down to middle latitudes. The occurrence of radio-auroras depends on solar activity (flares, coronal holes, CMEs) and annually the events are more numerous during solar cycle maxima. Radio aurora includes the so-called afternoon radio aurora which produces stronger but more distorted signals and after the Harang-minima, the late-night radio aurora (<b>sub-storming</b> phase) returns with variable signal strength and lesser doppler spread. The propagation range for this predominantly back-scatter mode extends up to about 2000km in east-west plane, but strongest signals are observed most frequently from the north at nearby sites on same latitudes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The Emotional Learning Algorithm {{has been}} {{introduced}} to show the effect of emotions as well known stimuli in the quick and almost satisficing decision making in human. The remarkable properties of emotional learning, low computational complexity and fast training, and its simplicity in multi objective problems has made it a powerful methodology in real time control and decision systems, where the gradient based methods and evolutionary algorithms are hard to {{be used due to}} their high computational complexity. Recently the emotional approach has been successfully used to obtain multiple objectives in prediction problems of real world phenomena, more specifically space weather forecasting. A newer and more realistic model of emotional learning in human brain is used in this study to predict the most popular index of geomagnetic activity: Kp. The interplanetary Kp index is mainly used in warning and alert systems for satellites. The proposed model with brain emotional learning algorithm is introduced to make purposeful prediction of Kp index.

40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made during the last forty years in identifying the processes that couple the magnetosphere and ionosphere. The progress was achieved with the aid of new measurement techniques, enhanced data coverage, sophisticated global models, and extensive model-data comparisons. It is now clear that the magnetosphere-ionosphere system exhibits a significant amount of spatial structure and rapid temporal variations. This variability is associated with magnetic storms and <b>sub-storms,</b> nonlinear processes that operate over a range of spatial scales, time delays, and feedback mechanisms between the two domains. The variability and resultant structure of the ionosphere can appear in the form of propagating plasma patches, polar wind jets, pulsing of the ion and neutral polar winds, auroral and boundary blobs, and ionization channels associated with sun-aligned polar cap arcs, discrete auroral arcs, and storm-enhanced densities (SEDs). The variability and structure of the thermosphere can appear in the form of propagating atmospheric holes, neutral gas fountains, neutral density patches, transient neutral jets and supersonic winds. Advances that were made during the last forty years in modeling the variability and structure associated with magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling will be presented. Speculation on where the field is headed will also be presented...|$|R
30|$|The Pi 2 {{pulsation}} is a {{damped oscillation}} with {{a period of}} 40 – 150 sec. (Saito, 1969; Olson, 1999). Simultaneous occurrence of the Pi 2 pulsation with the substorm onset (e.g., Saito et al., 1976) indicates that the Pi 2 pulsation {{is one of the}} important ingredients in the substorm processes. Thus, when we make a numerical substorm model, it is important to investigate how the Pi 2 pulsation is generated at the <b>sub-storm</b> onset in the model. We have a newly improved MHD simulation model that is believed to reproduce correctly the substorm onset (Tanaka et al., 2010). Thus, {{it is important to consider}} how the Pi 2 pulsation is generated in the simulation. This is the motivation of the present work.|$|E

It is shown that the wave appears in some azimuthal location simultaneously with the particle cloud ar-rival at the same spot. The value of the azimuthal wave number is determined as m∼ω/ωd, where ω is the eigen-frequency of the standing Alfvén wave and ωd is the particle drift frequency.

40|$|Abstract. The {{storage and}} {{subsequent}} removal of magnetic flux in the magnetotail during a geomagnetic substorm has a dramatic {{effect on the}} thickness of the cross-tail plasma sheet. The near-Earth plasma sheet is thought to thin during the growth phase and then rapidly expand after onset of the substorm. The direction of propagation, whether earthward or tailward along the GSM–X direction in the near-Earth tail, may suggest the time ordering of current-disruption and near-Earth reconnection, both of which are key to the <b>sub-storm</b> process. Cluster’s Plasma Electron And Current Ex-periment (PEACE) allows 4 -point observations of electrons at the plasma sheet – lobe boundary as this interface passes over the Cluster tetrahedron.

5000|$|An aurora is {{most likely}} to occur during periods of high solar {{activity}} when there is a high probability of a large solar flare. When such an eruption occurs, charged particles from the flare may spiral towards earth arriving about a day later. This may or may not cause an aurora: if the interstellar magnetic field has same polarity, the particles do not get coupled to the geomagnetic field efficiently. Besides sunspot-related active solar surface areas, other solar phenomena that produce particles causing auroras, such as re-occurring coronal holes spraying out intense solar wind. These charged particles are affected and captured by the geomagentic field and the various radiation belts surrounding earth. The aurora-producing relativistic electrons eventually precipitate towards earth's magnetic poles, resulting in an aurora which disrupts short-wave communications (SID) due to ionospheric/magnetic storms in the D, E, and F layers. Various visual effects are also seen in the sky towards the north [...] - [...] aptly called the Northern Lights. The same effect occurs in the Southern Hemisphere, but the visual effects are towards the south. The auroral event starts by onset of geomagnetic storm, followed by number of <b>sub-storms</b> over the next day or so.|$|R
40|$|Rain nowcasting is an {{essential}} part of weather monitoring and it plays a vital role in human life ranging from advanced warning systems to schedule an open air game and planning a trip to a tourist place. A nowcasting system can be divided into three fundamental steps i. e. Storm Identification, Tracking and Nowcasting. The main contribution of this work is to propose procedures for each step of rain nowcasting tool and objectively evaluate the performances of every step, focusing on two-dimension data collected from short range X-band radars installed in different parts of Italy. This work presents the solution to the issues faced by the storm identification step of already developed tools such as TITAN (Thunderstorm Identification, Tracking, Analysis and Nowcasting) and SCIT(The Storm Cell Identification and Tracking) where a storm is contiguous area in radar observation exceeding in both radar reflectivity and area from certain reflectivity and areal threshold. The first issue is that the existing nowcasting tools are unable to choose a suitable initial reflectivity threshold. The second issue is that some of the nowcasting tools (i. e. TITAN, SCIT) are not able to isolate false merger. A false merger is a weak point which combines two or more storms into one storm. The third issue is that some of these tools (i. e. TITAN) are unable to identify high reflectivity <b>sub-storms</b> within a large storm called cluster of storms. Very little attention has been given to storm identification evaluation. Up to the best of our knowledge, automatic thresholding is introduced for the first time to handle the first issue while the second issue is solved by mathematical erosion. Third issue is solved by multi-thresholding. Up to the best of our knowledge, storm identification evaluation is introduced for the first time. Storm tracking step of the existing tools such as TITAN and SCIT use only up to two storm attributes i. e. center of mass and area, for tracking. There exists a room for the usage of more attributes for tracking. Also, the contribution of each attribute in storm tracking is yet to investigate. This paper presents a novel procedure called SALdEdA (Structure, Amplitude, Location, Eccentricity difference and Areal difference) for storm tracking. This work also presents the contribution of each component of SALdEdA in storm tracking. The second order exponential smoothing strategy is used for storm nowcasting where the growth and decay of each variable of interest is considered to be linear. The obtained results of all three steps are quite promising. The adopted techniques for automatic threshold calculation are assessed with a 97 % goodness. False merger and <b>sub-storms</b> within a cluster of storms are successfully handled. Furthermore storm tracking procedure produced very good results with an accuracy of 99. 34...|$|R
30|$|Although we {{have focused}} so far on the {{creation}} of ionospheric irregularities and their effect on satellite signals, {{it should be noted that}} the same space weather processes which produce strong density structures in the high-latitude ionosphere also severely affect the propagation of radio signals at all frequencies from ELF to VHF, including commercial radio broadcasts and ground-to-ground and ground-to-air communications. Reflections from sharp density gradients, such as auroral boundaries or trough walls, can introduce large multi-path delays to received signals, while fast plasma drifts in the ionosphere can give rise to spectral spreading and Doppler shifts in radio signals. The most severe of all are the impacts caused by geomagnetic storms and <b>sub-storms,</b> which can radically affect the density distribution of the ionosphere and can completely inhibit radio propagation, since signals can be completely absorbed in the lower ionosphere or can propagate straight out into space without being reflected (e.g. Blagoveschensky and Borisova, 2000; Hunsucker and Hargreaves 2002). As a result, there is a wide community of potential users needing reliable forecasts of the radio propagation environment in the high-latitude region, where models are notoriously unreliable. The wide coverage area and continuous operation of EISCAT_ 3 D will make it an invaluable resource for users of the radio spectrum who need to constrain model predictions with real data (see “Space weather impacts on technology”).|$|R
30|$|As for earlier {{versions}} of the CHAOS model series, only scalar intensity data were used poleward of ± 55 ^∘ quasi-dipole latitude, and these were selected only when the merging electric field at the magnetopause (averaged over the preceding hour) E_m< 0.8 mV/m. In CHAOS- 6, E_m was calculated using 1 -min values of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and solar wind speed from OMNIWeb ([URL] in contrast to {{earlier versions}} of the CHAOS model where 5 -min mean values were used. In addition, an additional selection criterion that IMF B_Z > 0 was introduced in CHAOS- 6, motivated {{by a desire to}} avoid as far as possible disturbances related to the <b>sub-storm</b> auroral electrojet that are especially prominent when IMF B_Z < 0. Scalar data were also used at lower latitudes when attitude data were not available.|$|E
30|$|Renewed {{interest}} in the conjugate effects in the Earth’s environment has been raised by the ICESTAR Program which focuses on the “Inter-hemispheric Similarities and Asymmetries in Geospace Phenomena” ([URL] The primary goal of the ICESTAR Program {{is to create an}} integrated, quantitative description of the upper atmosphere over Antarctica, and its coupling to the global atmosphere and the geospace environment. It is found that there exists a systematic displacement for the <b>sub-storm</b> onset locations in one hemisphere compared to the other (Ostgaard et al., 2007). At the same time, no evidence of geomagnetic conjugacy in pulsating aurora is found, as discussed in Watanabe et al. (2007). The authors report two types of non-conjugacy: (i) pulsating auroras can appear in both hemispheres but their spatial appearance and period are different and (ii) pulsating auroras appear only in one hemisphere.|$|E
30|$|Space weather {{can also}} have very {{significant}} effects on the neutral atmosphere, especially at high latitudes. As noted above, {{some of the most}} significant processes are associated with geomagnetic storms, because such events can last several days and have global effects. During storms and sub-storms, large amounts of energy are injected into the polar upper atmosphere in the form of electric currents, accelerated particles, and Poynting flux. The sudden heating of the upper atmosphere can change its composition and chemistry, which in turn feed back into changes in the density and structure of the ionosphere. Some of the energy entering the polar atmosphere can also affect the neutral winds, changing the circulation of the upper atmosphere. In addition, storm and <b>sub-storm</b> effects generate a whole spectrum of atmospheric gravity waves, which in turn produce travelling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs).|$|E
30|$|The {{stream of}} charged particles, the solar wind, blows {{continuously}} from the Sun. When {{it hits the}} Earth’s magnetosphere, it is compressed to a radius of about 70, 000  km on the dayside by {{the pressure of the}} solar wind and stretched into a long tail extending at least 3.5  million km into space on the nightside of the Earth. Some of the energy carried by the solar wind penetrates inside the magnetosphere, and a significant part of it dissipates eventually in the Earth’s atmosphere. The activity of the Sun varies on short (minutes) to long (millions of years) timescales. Perhaps the most well known is the 11 -year sunspot cycle; as the number of sunspots increases, so does solar activity. During high solar activity, events called coronal mass ejections (CMEs) often take place, which suddenly and violently release bubbles of gas (plasma) and magnetic fields from the solar atmosphere. Large and fast CMEs can approach masses of 1013  kg and velocities of 2000  km/s. Earth-impacting CMEs can result in significant geomagnetic storms. During the declining phase of the solar cycle, the high-speed solar wind emanating from the coronal holes runs into the slower solar wind, and the interaction leads to a compression of the plasma and magnetic fields, forming corotating interaction regions (CIRs). Those have been found to cause also geomagnetic storms and <b>sub-storms.</b> CMEs and CIRs affect the ionosphere mainly by the process of magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction, whereas some other effects from the Sun like solar energetic particles (SEPs) and radiation bursts at different wavelengths can affect directly the ionosphere.|$|R
40|$|Long range {{weather radar}} {{observations}} are regularly used for short term forecasting and severe weather warning systems. Here, data acquired by portable and short range X-band mini weather radar are used, {{in order to}} try to forecast storms which are moving within the radar visibility area. Key step in developing an adequate storm forecasting system is the storm identification, because the overall system accuracy strictly depends on it. A storm is a contiguous region within a meteorological radar map where radar reflectivity is greater than a certain threshold and its area is greater than a certain areal threshold. Most of the storm identification techniques are manual or semi-automated and many of them are based on single or multi-level threshold(s). These techniques are facing the problems of choosing a suitable threshold value, and the one related to the so called "false merger problem". Moreover they are hardly able to indentify <b>sub-storms</b> within a cluster of storms. To cope with these issues, an automated multi-level thersholding technique is introduced where the initial threshold is automatically calculated by using two different techniques. After that, multileveling of threshold solves the problem of identifying substorms within the cluster of storms. The false merger problem has been instead solved by exploiting the mathematical morphology erosion concept. Storms are approximated and modeled by ellipses and their properties such as centroids, area, and major and minor axis length are calculated. Results show that all of the problems faced by previous systems in storm identification phase seem to be mitigated. Preliminary results about storm tracking and forecasting and preliminary are also presented in this paper...|$|R
30|$|In the Earth’s magnetosphere, various plasma {{phenomena}} simultaneously {{occur at}} various time, spatial, and energy scales. The generation and disappearance mechanisms of the Earth’s radiation belt are critical issues in space {{weather and the}} science of magnetized planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn. It {{is well known that}} the high-energy particle population trapped in the Earth’s radiation belt significantly changes during the magnetically disturbed period of magnetic storms and high-speed solar wind streams (HSS) (e.g., Paulikas and Blake 1979; Reeves et al. 2003). Since Summers et al. (1998) proposed that relativistic electrons in the outer belt are produced by acceleration with the whistler-mode chorus, many studies have investigated the relationship between outer radiation belt variation and the whistler-mode chorus during a magnetic storm “recovery” (e.g., Miyoshi et al. 2003; Horne et al. 2005; Kasahara et al. 2009; Thorne 2010; Turner et al. 2013). Kasahara et al. (2004) used statistical methods to study the spatial distribution of the whistler-mode chorus during magnetic storm recovery phases with data from the VLF instruments (Kimura et al. 1990) on board the Akebono satellite. This study clarified that the whistler-mode chorus is primarily located near the inner edge of the outer radiation belt (L[*]~[*] 2.5) and gradually shifts outward (L[*]~[*] 4) with time and that the total wave energy generated during the storm is large enough to accelerate relativistic electrons. Recently, Miyoshi et al. (2013) demonstrated that whistler-mode waves accelerate relativistic electrons during HSS events with southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)-dominant HSS (SBz-HSS), while this acceleration mechanism is not effective during HSS events with northward IMF-dominant HSS (NBz-HSS). They finally suggested that the responses of the outer radiation belt flux depend on the whistler-mode wave-electron interactions that are associated with a series of <b>sub-storms.</b>|$|R
