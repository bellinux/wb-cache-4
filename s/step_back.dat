5|$|Mole {{suffered}} a heart attack in 1896, likely due to excessive work and the ensuing illness lead to her taking a <b>step</b> <b>back</b> from organisational work the following year. Her son, Fred, died in 1905. On 15 April 1912, whilst on holiday in Paris, Mole died.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} January 2008, on {{the last}} day of the {{transfer}} window, Reid joined Sunderland in a three and a half-year deal worth £5m, making the <b>step</b> <b>back</b> up to the Premier League. Sunderland's Greg Halford went in the other direction in a six-month loan spell as part of the deal. Reid explained that he wanted Sunderland to be challenging for European places, and will not be happy fighting relegation season-after-season.|$|E
5|$|He {{resigned}} {{his post}} in 1932 after being requested to <b>step</b> <b>back</b> by the Dutch minister of Foreign Affairs, {{who wished to}} free some senior diplomatic posts for younger diplomats waiting to be appointed envoy.

5|$|By {{the early}} years of the 20th century, Boyce had become a multi-millionaire and had taken a <b>step</b> <b>back</b> from his {{businesses}} to pursue his interests in civic affairs, devoting more time to traveling and participating in expeditions. In 1909, he embarked on a two-month trip to Europe and a large photographic expedition to Africa with photographer George R. Lawrence and cartoonist John T. McCutcheon. Over the next two decades, Boyce led expeditions to South America, Europe, and North Africa, where he visited the newly discovered tomb of King Tutankhamun.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, {{state and}} federal {{officials}} began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to <b>step</b> <b>back</b> from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E

5|$|James VI's {{inheritance}} of the English crown in 1603 led to rule via the Privy Council from London. He also increasingly controlled the {{meetings of the}} Scottish General Assembly and increased the number and powers of the Scottish bishops. In 1618, he held a General Assembly and pushed through Five Articles, which included practices that had been retained in England but largely abolished in Scotland, most controversially kneeling for the reception of communion. Although ratified, they created widespread opposition and resentment and were {{seen by many as}} a <b>step</b> <b>back</b> to Catholic practice.|$|E
5|$|Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour {{ended in}} tragedy on June 30, with an {{accident}} at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death {{as the crowd}} rushed to the front. After numerous requests for the crowd to <b>step</b> <b>back,</b> the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but {{it was already too}} late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event. Pearl Jam was initially blamed for the accident, but was later cleared of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} clones are then {{seen in a}} forest – one walks behind a tree and reappears dressed in casual attire. He climbs another tree and {{ends up in the}} {{bathroom}} of the woman's apartment, where he retrieves a package. The clone then crawls underneath her bed and finds himself underneath a car. He opens the package and finds a gasoline can, which he pours into a compartment located behind the car's license plate. All three clones enter the car and drive to the box, which they <b>step</b> <b>back</b> into; the video concludes with the box's explosion.|$|E

5|$|After an aborted {{attempt by}} Kennedy to bring yet another studio that {{had turned to}} him for help, First National Pictures, into the Photophone fold, RCA was ready to <b>step</b> <b>back</b> in: the company {{acquired}} Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced {{the creation of the}} Radio-Keith-Orpheum holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, kept Pathé separate from RKO and under his personal control. RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent; in the early 1930s, RCA's share of stock in the company rose as high as 60 percent. The company's production and distribution arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer, was incorporated early in 1929 as Radio Pictures. Looking {{to get out of the}} film business the following year, Kennedy arranged in late 1930 for RKO to purchase Pathé from him.|$|E
5|$|In Sicily, the {{decision}} was taken not just for fashion and appearance {{but also because it}} would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be caused in future quakes. In 1693, the cramped housing and streets had caused buildings to collapse together like dominoes. Although after the earthquake the avenues were broadened and the density of housing was lowered overall, cramped and narrow areas of housing still remained, posing a hazard for the poor. Architecturally and aesthetically, the big advantage of the new order of town planning was that unlike many Italian towns and cities, where one frequently encounters a monumental Renaissance church squeezed terrace fashion between incongruous neighbours, in urban Baroque design one can <b>step</b> <b>back</b> and actually see the architecture in a more conducive setting in relation to its proportions and perspective. This is most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli.|$|E
5|$|In one draft, Picard kills Data {{early in}} the film, and the android is later resurrected to help the Captain in the finale. The first two drafts {{featured}} the Romulans as the protagonists, since they had never prominently appeared in a Star Trek film. The second draft was seen by Jonathan Dolgen at the studio; Dolgen was not pleased and Patrick Stewart {{thought that it would}} have been only suitable for a television episode. In the third draft, the Son'a were introduced as the children of the Ba'ku and the alien race that wanted to plunder the planet. That version also included the crew sub-plots, such as the Troi-Riker romance and the regeneration of La Forge's eyes. Stewart, who was concerned that the film was a <b>step</b> <b>back</b> in scope from First Contact, was consulted on the treatments.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, Har Gobind Khorana and {{co-workers}} developed a phosphodiester method where 3’-O-acetylnucleoside-5’-O-phosphate 2 (Scheme 3) was activated with N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or 4-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Ts-Cl). The activated species were reacted with a 5’-O-protected nucleoside 1 {{to give a}} protected dinucleoside monophosphate 3. Upon the removal of 3’-O-acetyl group using base-catalyzed hydrolysis, further chain elongation was carried out. Following this methodology, sets of tri- and tetradeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized and were enzymatically converted to longer oligonucleotides, which allowed elucidation of the genetic code. The major limitation of the phosphodiester method consisted {{in the formation of}} pyrophosphate oligomers and oligonucleotides branched at the internucleosidic phosphate. The method seems to be a <b>step</b> <b>back</b> from the more selective chemistry described earlier; however, at that time, most phosphate-protecting groups available now had not yet been introduced. The lack of the convenient protection strategy necessitated taking a retreat to a slower and less selective chemistry to achieve the ultimate goal of the study.|$|E
5|$|The third {{series of}} Spooks was {{produced}} by Kudos Film and Television for the BBC. Much of the production crew from the first two series returned. New crew members were brought in with the requirement that they were fans of the series and have ambition, {{so that they can}} understand Spooks. Andrew Woodhead was the series producer, with Jane Featherstone, Simon Crawford Collins and Gareth Neame as executive producers. Collins, who was the producer for the first two series, had to <b>step</b> <b>back</b> to executive producer, as he was overcommitted producing Kudos crime series Hustle. Woodhead replaced him as he was accustomed to the show, but also added more vitality to the show. Christopher Aird was the assistant producer. The third series included five writers. Howard Brenton wrote the first, second and eighth episodes. Rupert Walters wrote the third and ninth episodes. Ben Richards wrote the fourth, sixth and tenth episodes. Richards previously wrote the ninth episode of series two, and accepted the offer to return. His script in the second series was his first script for television; he found writing easier as time went by. Raymond Khoury wrote the seventh episode. Series creator David Wolstencroft wrote the fifth episode. Wolstencroft was poised to write the next episode, but found himself committed to other projects.|$|E
5|$|Witton {{elaborated}} in 2012 and 2013 on {{the idea}} that Istiodactylus was a scavenger. Scavenging birds have a mosaic of strong and weak elements in their skulls; {{they do not have to}} struggle with their prey, but need to be able to tear and pull morsels from cadavers. These birds also have relatively small eyes compared to predatory birds, as they do not need to search for hiding animals, or to make carefully judged attacks on their prey. Istiodactylus appears to have had large jaw muscles, and therefore a strong bite, and the skull was deep, which would have helped resist bending when pulling flesh. Individual bones of the skull were instead slender and shallow, and the toothrows were short, which indicates Istiodactylus did not have the necessary reinforcements for predation, and did not have to subdue struggling prey. Together, these features indicate Istiodactylus fed on large prey that necessitated strong jaws for processing, yet was also motionless enough so that strain on the jaws and skull could be controlled during feeding. The eyes of Istiodactylus also seem to have been proportionally small, compared to pterosaurs that are presumed to have been predatory (such as ornithocheirids). Witton concluded that among pterosaurs, Istiodactylus appears to have been the best-adapted for a scavenging lifestyle. He envisioned that istiodactylids would have to <b>step</b> <b>back</b> from a carcass if more powerful carnivores were attracted to it, but would return to finish the remains when those animals were satiated.|$|E
