2500|$|The [...]380 ACP {{cartridge}} {{was derived}} from Browning's earlier [...]38 ACP design, which was only marginally more powerful. The [...]380 ACP {{was designed to be}} truly rimless, with headspace on the case mouth instead of the rim for better accuracy. These relatively low-powered designs were intended for blowback pistols which lacked a barrel locking mechanism, which is often required for any handgun firing a round more powerful than a [...]380. Using blowback operation, the design can be simplified, and lowered in cost; a locking mechanism is unnecessary, since the mass of the slide and strength of the recoil spring are enough to absorb the recoil energy of the round, due to the round's relatively low bolt thrust. Blowback operation also permits the barrel to be permanently fixed to the frame, which promotes accuracy, unlike a traditional short recoil-operation pistol, which requires a [...] "tilting" [...] barrel to unlock the slide and barrel assembly when cycling. A drawback of the blowback system is that it requires a certain amount of slide mass (weight) to counter the recoil of the round used. The higher the power the round, the heavier the slide assembly has to be in order for its inertia to safely absorb the recoil, meaning that a typical blowback pistol in a given caliber will be heavier than an equivalent recoil-operated weapon (alternatively, a very <b>stiff</b> <b>spring</b> will work, but will make operating the slide very difficult). Blowback weapons can be made in calibers larger than [...]380 ACP, but the required weight of slide and strength of spring makes this an unattractive option. Although the low power of the [...]380 ACP does not require a locking mechanism, there have also been a number of locked-breech pistols chambered in [...]380 ACP, such as the Remington Model 51, Kel-Tec P3AT and Glock 42; all three being designed to be lighter than blowback operated [...]380 ACP weapons. There have also been some relatively diminutive (blowback-operated) submachine guns, such as the Ingram MAC-11 and the Czech vz. 83.|$|E

50|$|The Mk.1 and Mk.1A {{computers}} were electromechanical, {{and many of}} their mechanical calculations required drive movements of precise speeds. They used reversible two-phase capacitor-run induction motors with tungsten contacts. These were stabilized primarily by rotary magnetic drag (eddy-current) slip clutches, similar to classical rotating-magnet speedometers, but with a much higher torque. One part of the drag was geared to the motor, and the other was constrained by a fairly <b>stiff</b> <b>spring.</b> This spring offset the null position of the contacts by an amount proportional to motor speed, thus providing velocity feedback. Flywheels mounted on the motor shafts, but coupled by magnetic drags, prevented contact chatter when the motor was at rest. Unfortunately, the flywheels must also have slowed down the servos somewhat.A more elaborate scheme, which placed a rather large flywheel and differential between the motor and the magnetic drag, eliminated velocity error for critical data, such as gun orders.|$|E
50|$|See drawing, right. The stackfreed {{consists}} of a <b>stiff</b> <b>spring</b> arm (A) with a roller at the end (B) which presses against an eccentric cam (D), usually the roller rides in a groove in the cam's edge. The cam is shaped like a snail. It has a gear on it (E) that is turned by a gear on the mainspring arbor (C), so it makes one turn during the clock's running period. The force of the spring arm against the cam exerts a retarding force on the mainspring, reducing its torque, which varies with {{the thickness of the}} cam. When the mainspring is fully wound up, the arm presses against the wide part of the cam. Since it is far from the axis, the retarding force it exerts is maximum. As the clock runs and the mainspring unwinds, the cam rotates and the spring bears against the narrower parts of the cam, reducing the retarding force gradually, to compensate for the declining force of the mainspring. At the end of the running period there was often a steep depression in the cam that the roller pressed against, so the force of the stackfreed spring aided the weakened mainspring.|$|E
5000|$|Self-loading {{automatic}} pistols can {{be divided}} into [...] "blowback" [...] and [...] "locked breech" [...] categories according to their principle of operation. The blowback operating principle is suitable for smaller, lower-powered calibers, such as [...]32 ACP and [...]380 ACP, as the resistance of the recoil spring and mass of the slide are sufficient to retard the opening of the breech until the projectile has left the barrel, and breech pressure has dropped to a safe level. For more powerful calibers such as the 9 mm Parabellum (9 mm) and [...]45 ACP, some form of locked breech is needed to retard breech opening, as an unlocked blowback pistol in these calibers requires a very heavy slide and <b>stiff</b> <b>spring,</b> making them bulky, heavy, and difficult to operate. A somewhat commercially successful blowback pistol design in the more powerful calibers was produced; the Spanish Astra 400 in 9 mm Largo and the similar Astra 600 in 9 mm Parabellum. U.S. manufacturer Hi-Point also produces a line of blowback-operated pistols in several calibers, including 9 mm and [...]45 ACP. Virtually all other service-caliber pistols are locked-breech designs.|$|E

50|$|Before firing, {{the bolt}} body is {{separated}} from the locked bolt head by a <b>stiff</b> <b>spring.</b> As the shotgun recoils after firing, inertia causes the bolt body to remain stationary while the recoiling gun and locked bolt head move rearward. This movement compresses the spring between the bolt head and bolt body, storing the energy required to cycle the action. Since the spring can only be compressed a certain amount, this limits the amount of force the spring can absorb, and provides an inherent level of self-regulation to the action, allowing {{a wide range of}} shotshells to be used, from standard to magnum loads, as long as they provide the minimum recoil level to compress the spring. Note that the shotgun must be free to recoil for this to work—the compressibility of the shooter's body is sufficient to allow this movement, but firing the shotgun from a secure position in a rest or with the stock against the ground will not allow it to recoil sufficiently to operate the mechanism. Likewise, care must be exercised when modifying weapons of this type (e.g. addition of extended magazines or ammunition storage on the stock), as any sizable increase in weapon mass can reduce the force of recoil below that required to cycle the action.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the initial}} launch the Numark units {{received}} mixed reviews, with several flaws and inadequate quality assurance being pointed out. Some found the tonearm as supplied was not accurately calibrated or properly {{aligned with the}} platter, {{but it can be}} tweaked and adjusted to perform well. The platter in some cases exhibited noticeable warp or axial run-out, which appears to be in part due to the ceramic ring magnetic that secures the platter to the spindle not being glued correctly to the underside of the platter. Some reviewers complained that the pitch system was not calibrated accurately, although not off by much. On later production models, probably the Pro TT-2 only, it is reported that access holes are provided {{on the bottom of the}} turntable base to permit pitch calibration using a screwdriver. Others considered the LCD display to be of little practical value since the pitch value shown is not precise. Also, in some cases the stylus pressure ring on the tonearm counterbalance weight assembly turns much too freely. And, unfortunately, the dust cover hinges eventually fail due to cracking at the bottom of the plastic housing for the counterbalance spring which is under the constant load of the <b>stiff</b> <b>spring.</b> One failed hinge keeps the dust cover from staying open when raised.|$|E
50|$|Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (1869-1959), a Scottish physicist, is {{credited}} with inventing the cloud chamber. Inspired by sightings of the Brocken spectre while working on the summit of Ben Nevis in 1894, he began to develop expansion chambers for studying cloud formation and optical phenomena in moist air. Very rapidly he discovered that ions could act as centers for water droplet formation in such chambers. He pursued the application of this discovery and perfected the first cloud chamber in 1911. In Wilson's original chamber the air inside the sealed device was saturated with water vapor, then a diaphragm was used to expand the air inside the chamber (adiabatic expansion), cooling the air and starting to condense water vapor. Hence the name expansion cloud chamber is used. When an ionizing particle passes through the chamber, water vapor condenses on the resulting ions and {{the trail of the}} particle is visible in the vapor cloud. Wilson, along with Arthur Compton, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927 for his work on the cloud chamber. This kind of chamber is also called a Pulsed Chamber because the conditions for operation are not continuously maintained. Further developments were made by Patrick Blackett who utilised a <b>stiff</b> <b>spring</b> to expand and compress the chamber very rapidly, making the chamber sensitive to particles several times a second. A cine film was used to record the images.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, including Jarzynski's equality and the Crooks Fluctuation Theorem, {{have made the}} calculation of equilibrium free energy differences from irreversible processes possible. Building off these theorems, two approaches {{have been developed to}} calculate the free energy surface, or potential of mean force, along a continuous reaction coordinate: the <b>stiff</b> <b>spring</b> approximation and the Hummer-Szabo method. In this thesis, we extend the Hummer-Szabo method to encompass pulling experiments performed with different biasing protocols and to calculate multidimensional potentials of mean force.

Next, we compare the efficacy of the <b>stiff</b> <b>spring</b> approximation and the Hummer-Szabo method in interpreting pulling experiments at different spring stiffnesses and using dynamic force spectroscopy on the model peptide deca-alanine. We find that analysis based on the <b>stiff</b> <b>spring</b> approximation fails when weaker springs are used. The Hummer-Szabo method is generally more effective for interpreting dynamic force spectroscopy. For both methods, the second cumulant expansion is found to {{be a good way to}} make the best of a limited sample.

40|$|Abstract — Series elastic {{actuators}} primarily use linear {{springs in}} their drivetrains, which introduces a design tradeoff: soft springs provide higher torque resolution {{at the cost}} of system bandwidth, whereas <b>stiff</b> <b>springs</b> provide a fast response but lower torque resolution. Nonlinear springs (NLSs) poten-tially incorporate the benefits of both soft and <b>stiff</b> <b>springs,</b> but such springs are often large. An NLS design was recently proposed that combines a variable radius cam with a rubber elastic element, enabling a compact spring design. However, the rubber introduces hysteresis, which can lead to poor torque tracking if not accounted for in the controller. To overcome this limitation, we here propose a state observer that captures hysteretic effects exhibited by the rubber to provide an accurate estimate of actuator torque. We perform torque-control experiments with this observer on an actuator testbed and compare the performance of the NLS to both soft and <b>stiff</b> linear metal <b>springs.</b> Experiments show that the NLS exhibits improved output impedance compared to both linear springs, and comparable bandwidth to the <b>stiff</b> linear <b>spring</b> up to 1. 5 Hz. However, the hysteresis in the urethane rubber introduces instability in higher-frequency conditions, suggesting that future NLS designs can be improved by use of a different rubber as the elastic element.

The recent finite element formulations retain the same strategies employed in the original immersed boundary method, namely, the independent Lagrangian solid mesh moves on top of a fixed or pre-scribed background Eulerian fluid mesh. The added features in recent finite element formulations are the generality of the immersed solid which can occupy a finite volume in the fluid and be imper-meable, compressible, and highly deformable. Furthermore, a matrix-free Newton-Krylov iterative solution technique also resolves the time step limitation issues related to <b>stiff</b> <b>spring</b> supports from the boundary and the high elasticity moduli of the immersed solid.
