40|$|Discharge via the {{municipal}} waste water system is the dominant emission pathway to water for many micropollutants especially for household chemicals, substances used in commerce and industry (especially in small and medium-sized enterprises), pharmaceuticals and biocides. Against this background, the primary objective {{of this study was}} to develop suitable measures or combinations of measures and their framework conditions to reduce the emission of micropollutants to water via {{the municipal}} waste water system that are characterized by high cost efficiency. The emission-relevant material flows were analysed for twelve selected micropollutants and to some extent the <b>substance</b> <b>input</b> into the water bodies were modelled. The results served as basis for the derivation of emission reduction measures. A focal point was the investigation into costs and effectiveness of the introduction of an advanced treatment stage in municipal wastewater treatment plants and the constraints to be considered with this. At the same time, the result have shown that both source-oriented as well as decentralised measures, depending on the substance considered, represent a cost-efficient possibility for the reduction of emission and can make an important contribution to the implementation of the polluter pays principle...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of the loading of bodies of water with micropollutants has, for many years, been an important objective of the water industry. For selected micropollutants for which the municipal wastewater system is the dominating input path, the emissions-relevant material flows are analysed {{and to some extent}} the <b>substance</b> <b>input</b> into the bodies of water are modelled. The results serve as basis for the derivation of emission reduction measures. A focal point here is the investigation into costs and into the effectiveness of the introduction of a fourth treatment stage in municipal wastewater treatment plants and the constraints to be considered with this. At the same time, the tasks that both source-oriented as well as decentralised measures, depending on the substance considered, represent a cost-efficient possibility for the {{reduction of}} emissions and can make an important contribution to the implementation of the polluter pays principle. The results achieved illustrate the need for action with regard to a comprehensive strategy in the field of micropollutants, which concentrate different approaches for emission reduction measures taking into account all areas of polluters in order to achieve a high acceptance of the necessary steps and to realise the dominantly important objective of a good condition in the bodies of water...|$|E

In this study, we combine intracellular recording from dorsal horn neurons in vivo, characterization of their nociceptive responses, intracellular labeling by injection of horseradish peroxidase, and immunocytochemical demonstration of substance P at the electron microscopic level. The results reveal that dorsal horn neurons that respond to noxious cutaneous stimulation with a slow, prolonged excitatory postsynaptic potential receive a preferentially high number of substance P fibers compared with nonnociceptive neurons, which scarcely receive any <b>substance</b> P <b>input.</b> Therefore, this study provides direct evidence of a structural-functional link for a substance P-mediated nociceptive response...|$|R

30|$|Due to competition, {{changes in}} {{customer}} demand and legal issues, corporate executives {{need to focus}} on aspects of the sustainability of value creation, including a new set of challenges in decision making. Companies are trying to develop products with a certain quality and minimal cost. Today, the environmental and social performance of products beyond the entire life cycle of the product should be taken into account. From an environmental point of view, product design should lead to products that are characterized by reducing the severity of harmful <b>substances,</b> less <b>input</b> of toxic materials, decomposition, durability, ease of recovery, and less energy consumption and life span. Stindt argued that supply chain design is a mutual planning issue that involves all processes of the value chain of the core company with interfaces with the supplier and consumer that shows the resources and flow of materials (Stindt 2017). Recently, more companies have turned to using sustainable proactive strategies and management operations of an evolving sustainable supply chain. In the meantime, researchers considered closed loop supply chain (CLSC) {{as one of the most}} important factors for achieving sustainable operations. In the modern world of business, focus is not only on reducing costs and increasing profits, but also on achieving sustainability and creating a balance between social responsibility, environmental protection and economic prosperity; these factors result in sustainability (Sgarbossa and Russo 2017).|$|R

The water quality assessment {{is very important}} for implementation of the monitoring and remediation programs to minimize the risk promoted by hazardous substances in aquatic ecosystems. Evaluation of the degree of contamination of aquatic environments must not take in account only its chemical characterization but it must be complemented with biological assays, which determine potential toxic effects and allows an integrated evaluation of its effects in populations and aquatic ecosystem communities. The application of this type of strategy has clear advantages allowing a general evaluation of the effects from all the water components, including those due to unknown substances and synergic, antagonistic, or additive effects. There are only a few studies that reported ecotoxicological acute end points, for the assessment of surface water quality, and the relationship among toxicity results and the anthropogenic pollution sources and the seasonal period.

40|$|International audienceAccording to the {{requirements}} of the EU Water Framework Directive (EU-WFD, article 17. 2 a) criteria for the assessment of the chemical status of groundwater have to be developed, which may serve as starting points for a trend reversal (article 17. 2 b) in case the good status is failed. Against this background an EU-wide applicable approach to assess natural background levels (NBLs) and threshold values (TVs) for the definition of the groundwater chemical status has been developed. NBLs are derived based on a preselection method using aquifer typologies as natural reference systems. Samples with purely anthropogenic substances (e. g. PAC, pesticides) as well as samples, in which indicator <b>substances</b> for anthropogenic <b>inputs</b> (e. g. nitrate) are exceeding a certain value, are excluded. The NBLs are defined for the remaining groundwater samples of the aquifer typology under concern as the concentration range between the 10 % and 90 % percentiles. The threshold values (TVs) get established with reference to the NBLs and a "not acceptable reference value" (REF), e. g. drinking water standards or toxicological values, guaranteeing that the TVs are higher than the NBLs, but lower than the REF values. The applicability of the methodology for NBL and TV derivation has been applied to the transboundary groundwater body of the Upper Rhine Valley in Germany, Switzerland and France...|$|R
40|$|I {{investigate}} whether, as {{is commonly}} believed [...] {{and if so}} how [...] firm disclosure of so-called "toxic" releases, required since 1987 by the federal "Toxics Release Inventory ("TRI"), has brought about the reductions in toxic releases that have occurred since that time. Existing literature, consisting principally of event studies of stock market returns, suggest that dirty firms experience abnormal negative returns. Using a micro-level data set that links TRI releases to plant level Census data for petroleum refineries, I study plant-level behavior, exploiting state variation in toxics regulations, and exploring the relationship between TRI releases and concomitant regulation of non-toxic pollutants. I find that, although TRI induced public disclosure {{may have contributed to}} the decline in reported toxic releases, that alone has not been the cause of those reductions: the evidence is strong that changes in toxic emission intensity are a byproduct of more traditional command and control regulation of emissions of non-toxic pollutants. I find that (1) since 1987, refineries have become substantially cleaner in terms of over-all toxic releases; (2) the clean-up has not occurred through substitution away from TRI listed <b>substances</b> as <b>inputs</b> or alteration in the mix of outputs; and (3) refineries in states with more stringent supplemental regulation of toxics (e. g. with specific state-wide goals for toxic reductions) have significantly lower toxic emission intensity levels than refineries in other states. I find also that (4) TRI air releases are highly correlated with levels of criteria air pollution; (5) both toxic pollution levels and intensity fall with increases in pollution abatement (operating and maintenance) expenditures for non-toxic air pollution; and (6) TRI air releases are affected by being in more stringent regulatory regions for the criteria air pollutants. Finally, I link my data-set with CRSP data to re-evaluate the effect of TRI reporting on company stock market valuation, correcting for a methodological shortcoming (stemming from the fact that all reporting firms face a common event window) of prior event studies of the impact of the TRI. Correcting for that shortcoming, I find that (7) the evidence of negative abnormal returns around TRI reporting dates for petroleum companies is not significant. My findings suggest that the most probable mechanism through which TRI reporting may induce firms to clean up is local and state governmental use of TRI disclosures. They suggest also not only that the perceived effectiveness of TRI regulation has been overstated, but perhaps more importantly that the benefits of command and control regulation of non-toxic pollutants have been underestimated. ...|$|R

As part of the INRAM project, in which the risk of micropollutants is studied for the Belgian coastal zone, a cage experiment with mussels and oysters was conducted in the harbour of Zeebrugge and in the Sluice dock of Oostende to study the susceptibility of these bivalves to the prevealing stress. The cage experiment ran over a period of five months, from June 2007 till October 2007. Mussels (Mytilus edulis) and oysters (Crassostrea gigas) collected in a subtidal area of the Eastern Scheldt were transplanted to cages at four stations: outer harbour of Zeebrugge, inner harbour of Zeebrugge, Sluice Dock in Oostende and one at open sea. Mussels were sampled monthly, oysters bimonthly. Growth, condition index and gonad development were recorded. Soft tissue was saved for concentration measurements.

40|$|To {{achieve a}} {{sustainable}} or steady-state economy a society {{must be able}} to hold negative environmental impacts, whether defined as resource depletion or as pollution, to desired maxima. That is, it must control throughput defined as resource inputs plus low-value outputs. This can be done directly through capping <b>input</b> <b>substances</b> or approached indirectly through various sustainability paths, fruitfully classified into three groups: control of the number of people, control of the quantity of goods and services per person, and increasing the ratio of goods and services per unit of either resource consumption or pollution. This taxonomy coincides with the formula I = PAT. It is found that each indirect path suffers from rebounds: whatever inputs are left temporarily fallow after reducing population, and/or the affluence of some people, and/or the technological ratio of inputs to economic output, are merely consumed to support more people, raise the affluence of others, and/or increase the amount of economic output. In order however to decrease throughput to sustainable levels – solving the primary problem of human ecology, that of the scale of the human economy in relation to biophysical limits – we needn’t measure exact levels of rebound: directly imposing caps achieves this goal. Once overall caps are in place, population, affluence and efficiency will find their levels decentrally and democratically. Social problems to be addressed in a lower-throughput economy concern the just distribution of rights to consume or pollute common property, unemployment that can result from economic shrinkage, and in general just distribution of the pie when the pie is getting smaller. It is suggested that environmental research should focus on winning democratic majorities for sustainability and identifying the ethical, aesthetic and quality-of-life benefits of a smaller economy. Only worldwide political action – not that of individuals, firms or even countries – is likely to achieve sustainability...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study pre- and postsynaptic {{elements}} during postnatal development and aging. Motoneurons from two adjacent sacral motor nuclei in the cat spinal cord were investigated: the motoneurons innervating intrinsic foot-sole muscles (dorsolateral motor nucleus; DLN) and the motoneurons innervating striated perineal muscles (Onufs nucleus, ventrolateral motor nucleus; VLN). Most of the work has focused on dendrites, since they constitute > 90 % of the motoneuron's receptive domain. The employed techniques have been intracellular tracer labelling, indirect single- and double staining immunofluorescence, and pre- and postembedding immunocytochemistry. The establishment of VLN dendrites in a circumscribed rostro-caudally oriented bundle takes place {{during the first two}} postnatal months and appears to be closely linked to the occurrence of dendro dendritic contacts. During maturation a dramatic drop in the proportion of the dendritic membrane area involved in this type of contacts was seen. In the DLN, a postnatal remodelling of the dendrites was seen, including a five-fold increase in total dendritic membrane area, changes in branching pattern and a net decrease in number of branches per dendrite. Dendritic growth/remodelling and neo-synaptogenesis were, however, also seen in aged animals (15 y), indicating that neurons and their connectivity are continuously 'remodelled'. Several stigmata of aging were present in the VLN and DLN neuropil of older cats, as the increased frequency of dark-degenerating dendrites, and the occurrence of 'aberrant' dendrites with an irregular outline, increased electron density of the dendroplasm and tighter packing of neurotubules. Regarding presynaptic elements, the distribution and synaptic arrangement of different transmitter identified inputs to the VLN and DLN was examined. In adult animals, the descending bulbospinal serotoninergic pathway to the VLN was of the same size-order as that to the DLN. Experimental lesions (spinal cord transection at the lower thoracic level performed alone or in combination with unilateral dorsal rhizotomy) revealed a dual supraspinal and spinal origin for the <b>substance</b> P <b>input</b> to both nuclei. The contribution of substance P to the innervation of the VLN and DLN was of the same magnitude, although substance P-immunoreactive (IR) fibres of spinal origin were somewhat more frequent in the VLN. In addition, the VLN received also a denser enkephalinergic innervation than the DLN. Thirty-four % of the boutons apposing VLN dendrites were immunoreactive for glutamate, while 49 % of all boutons were immunoreactive for GABA and/or glycine. The proportions of boutons immunoreactive to glutamate and GABA and/or glycine were rather similar in the VLN and DLN. However, the proportion of boutons single labelled for glycine was greater in the DLN than in the VLN. Substance P-IR boutons had a rather even distribution throughout the dendritic trees of the VLN, apposing both thin distal branches and thick proximal dendrites, while TRH and enkephalin were preferentially located in apposition to more proximal dendritic domains. A frequent finding in the VLN was that one axonal bouton could be seen in synaptic contact with 2 - 3 dendrites. This divergence of the input at the terminal level was commonly seen among substance P-IR, enkephalin-lR and glutamate-lR boutons, as well as among boutons immunoreactive to GABA- and/or glycine. A similar arrangement was not observed for TRH, indicating that the supraspinal input to the VLN might rather be a point-to point system with each axonal bouton acting on a single postsynaptic element. In the VLN, differences were seen between animals of different ages in the distribution of amino acid inputs, in particular a smaller number of boutons immunoreactive to glutamate was observed in the older animals. Since no such differences were present in the DLN, this may reflect interindividual variations, changes in the endocrine system and/or differences with age. In the spinal cord of aged rats, axonal profiles showing aging-related morphological changes (accumulation of residual bodies, dystrophy and/or degeneration) were often enriched with immunoreactivity to glutathione (GSH). Since GSH is a scavenger for H 202, this suggests that oxidative stress may be relevant for axon degeneration during aging. In addition, about sixty-five percent of the GSH enriched axons with aging-related changes contained also glutamate-immunoreactivity. Aging related degeneration could not be verified for axons containing glycine and/or GABA. This implies that excitatory pathways may be more susceptible to aging-related changes than inhibitory pathways.

There are only a few studies that reported ecotoxicological acute end points, for the assessment of surface water quality, and the relationship among toxicity results and the anthropogenic pollution sources and the seasonal period. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the ecotoxicological characterization of the surface water from Alqueva reservoir (South of Portugal) and to evaluate the influence of anthropogenic sources of pollution and their seasonal variation in its toxicity. The construction of Alqueva reservoir was recently finished (2002) and, to our knowledge, an ecotoxicological assessment of its surface water has not been performed. Because of that, no information is available on the possible impact of pollutants on the biota. The surface water toxicity was assessed using acute and chronic bioassays. The results are to be used for developing a monitoring program, including biological methods. Water samples were collected during 2006 - 2007, at each of the nine sampling sites selected in Alqueva reservoir. These sampling points allow an assessment at the upstream (Sra. Ajuda, Alcarrache, Alamos-Capta double dagger o), at the middle (Alqueva-Montante, Alqueva-Mouro, Lucefecit), and at the downstream of the water line (Alqueva-Jusante; Ardila-confluncia; Moinho das Barcas). The campaigns occurred in February, March, May, July, September, and November of 2006 and February, March, and May of 2007. The rainy season comprised November, February, and March, and the dry season included May, July, and September. A total of 81 samples were collected during the study period. The physical-chemical parameters were analyzed following standard and recommended methods of analysis (APHA et al. 1998). The pesticide analyses were performed using gas chromatography according to DIN EN ISO 6468 (1996). Surface water ecotoxicity was evaluated using the following bioassays: Vibrio fischeri luminescence inhibition, Thamnocephalus platyurus mortality, and Daphnia magna immobilization and reproduction assay. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the associations between the water sample physicochemical properties (from each sampling station in each season) and the acute and chronic toxicological effects, with a level of significance p < 0. 05. In the acute toxicity study, the species that was found to be the most sensitive was T. platyurus. T. platyurus detected a higher number of toxic water samples during the dry season. Concerning the luminescent inhibition of V. fischeri, the results showed that this organism detected a great number of toxic water samples in rainy seasons. The water samples, which promoted higher toxic effects towards this species, were from the north and from the middle of the reservoir. The correlation analysis showed that V. fischeri luminescent inhibition (%) was positively correlated with total phosphorus, chlorpyrifos, iron, and arsenic. T. platyurus mortality (%) was positively correlated with the water pH, 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD(5)), chlorides, atrazine, simazine, terbuthylazine, and endosulfan sulfate contents. Although the surface waters did not promote acute toxicity to the crustacean D. magna, in the chronic exposure, a significant decrease in the number of juveniles per female was observed, mainly at the dry period. The number of juveniles per female, in the reproduction test of D. magna, was negatively correlated with pH, temperature, BOD(5), chloride, atrazine, simazine, terbuthylazine, and endosulfan sulfate. The water toxicity of the Alqueva water might be due principally to the intensive agriculture activities surrounding the reservoir and to the municipal wastewater discharges. The physicochemical parameters and the pesticide concentrations indicated that the water quality was worse in the north part of the reservoir system. These results are characteristic of the majority of reservoirs, once the construction of the dam promoted, by itself, the impounding of water flow and the increase of compound residence time. The toxicity tests corroborate with the chemical characterization. Acute toxicity of Alqueva water may be a result of the effect promoted by chlorpyrifos, endosulfan sulfate, phosphorus, and iron. Chronic toxicity may be a result of the effect of herbicides, arsenic, organic matter, endosulfan sulfate in mixture. Hence, the water toxicity of the Alqueva might be due principally to the intensive agriculture activities surrounding the reservoir and to the municipal wastewater discharges. This study has shown that a large number of samples from different sites of the Alqueva reservoir contained potentially toxic contaminants. The sites with impaired water quality were those located at the north of the reservoir and in the surrounding areas of intensive agricultural activity. The results demonstrated that the use of a screening of acute and chronic toxicity tests with organisms from different trophic levels and with distinct sensibilities allowed the detections of several patterns of toxicity from spatial and temporal variability promoted by natural or anthropogenic sources. The chronic responses showed, especially in the dry season, that some of the species belonging to this aquatic ecosystem might be at risk. The V. fischeri and T. platyurus are two species that should be used in the acute bioassays for the ecotoxicological monitoring programs of this reservoir. It is recommended that other species, such as a productive organism (algae), be included in the next study, once the water reservoir had high levels of herbicides. Ecotoxicological assessment of surface water must integrate initial screening based on acute tests followed always by chronic bioassays. The results implicitly suggest that the implementation of processes of remediation by reducing pollutant input into the reservoir and by the implementation of water treatment processes is important and necessary...|$|R

Crystallization is a key unit operation used for obtaining purified products by many process industries.

All these properties impact significantly the downstream operations such as drying or filtration. Therefore, monitoring and controlling this process is fundamental {{to ensure the quality}} of the final product. Process analytical technology (PAT) brings numerous new methods and opportunities in the process analytics and real time process monitoring systems, which can be integrated into the control algorithm and provide high level optimal control strategies as well as deeper understanding of the process. Process monitoring helps develop mathematical models which can, in one hand, help in better understanding the processes and consecvently the development and application of advanced control methods in order to achieve better product quality. In this work, image processing and image analysis based direct nucleation control (IA-DNC) is developed in order to investigate the evolution of the crystal properties, such as crystal size, and crystal shape distribution. The IA-DNC approach is also compared to alternative DNC techniques, in which particle number were measured by Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM) in order to control crystal size. A control approach is introduced that control the nucleation and disappearance of crystals during cooling and heating segments related to the changes of the number of counts (measured by Particle Vision Measurment, so called PVM or combination of FBRM and PVM). The approach was applied to investigate crystallization of compounds with different behavior: potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) water, contaminated KDP -water and Ascorbic acid water systems. The results demonstrate the application of imaging technique for model-free feedback control for tailoring crystal product properties. The second main aim of the thesis is to investigate and control crystallization processes in impure media in the presence of multiple impurities, with an impact on the crystal shape via growth kinetics. The broad impact of the crystal growth modifiers (impurities) on the growth kinetics is observed in real time by using in situ video imaging probe and real-time image analysis. A morphological population balance model is developed, which incorporates a multi-site, competitive adsorption mechanism of the impurities on the crystal faces. The kinetic parameters of primary nucleation, growth and impurity adsorption for a model system of potassium dihydrogen phosphate crystallization in water in the presence of two impurities, were estimated and validated with experimental results. It was demonstrated that the model can be used to describe the dynamic evolution of crystal properties, such as size and aspect ratio during crystallization for different impurity profiles in the system. Manual, feedback and hybrid feedback-feedforward control techniques are developed and investigated numerically for continuous processes, while model-based and model-free control approach for crystal shape are developed for batch processes. The developed morphological population balance model is implemented and applied in the model-based control approaches, which are suitable to describe multicomponent adsorption processes and their influence on the crystal shape. Case studies show the effectiveness of crystal growth modifiers based shape control techniques. Comparison of different control approaches shows the effectiveness of the techniques. The third part of the thesis deals with purification of crystals when adsorption of impurities on crystal surfaces and its incorporation into crystals are considered. A purification method, called competitive purity control (CPC) is proposed and investigated. A morphological population balance model, including nucleation, growth and competitive impurity adsorption kinetics is developed to describe the case when multiple impurities can adsorb competitively on the crystal surface. The model is also combined with liquid phase chemical reaction model, in order to investigate the purity control case when an additive is introduced in the system that reacts with the impurity forming a non-adsorbing reaction product. Both competitive purity control approaches proposed: the adsorption based competitive purity control (A-CPC) and the reaction based competitive purity control (R-CPC); are investigated using detailed numerical simulations then compared with the alternative widely used purification method, called recrystallization. In the last contribution chapter, an integrated process optimization of a continuous chemical reactor and crystallizer is performed and studied numerically. The {{purpose of this study is}} to show the way in which the byproduct produced in the chemical reactor may affect the crystallization process and how its negative effect can be reduced by applying integrated process optimization. Sensitivity analysis of the system was performed by considering the flow rate and the concentration of <b>substances</b> in the <b>input</b> stream of the chemical reactor as manipulated process variables. Model based integrated process optimization and the sensitivity analysis in order to obtain improved quality product in terms of crystal size, shape and purity...|$|R
