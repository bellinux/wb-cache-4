5|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that sperm whales sleep in {{vertical}} postures just under the surface in passive shallow 'drift-dives', generally during the day, during which whales {{do not respond to}} passing vessels unless they are in contact, leading to the <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> whales possibly sleep during such dives.|$|E
5|$|A genetic {{study in}} 2012 found clear {{differences}} between various {{populations of the}} Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Pantanal; Madeira River basin; Rio Negro basin) and these are apparently isolated from each others, leading to the <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> {{it may be a}} cryptic species complex.|$|E

5|$|During the Principate, {{recruitment}} {{into the}} legions {{was restricted to}} Roman citizens only. This rule, which derived from the pre-Social War Republican army, was strictly enforced. The few exceptions recorded, such as during emergencies and for the illegitimate sons of legionaries, do not warrant the <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> the rule was routinely ignored.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, Cantor's Halle {{colleague}} Eduard Heine died, {{creating a}} vacant chair. Halle accepted Cantor's <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> it {{be offered to}} Dedekind, Heinrich M. Weber and Franz Mertens, in that order, but each declined the chair after being offered it. Friedrich Wangerin was eventually appointed, {{but he was never}} close to Cantor.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the first}} {{discovered}} millisecond pulsar, with a rotational period of 1.557708 milliseconds, meaning it completes almost 642 rotations per second. This period was far shorter than astronomers considered pulsars capable of reaching, {{and led to the}} <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> pulsars can be spun-up by accreting mass from a companion.|$|E

5|$|The chapter {{ends with}} a {{discussion}} of animals that can change colour, including fish like the sole, the chameleon, the horned lizards and the tree frogs including the European species Hyla arborea. He cites Poulton's <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> the tree frog's camouflage may be both defensive (protecting from predators) and aggressive (facilitating the hunting of insects).|$|E
5|$|The <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> her {{building}} had been sped up by using guns and/or turrets originally {{designed for the}} s which preceded her is not borne out as the guns and turrets were not ordered until July 1905. It seems more likely that Dreadnoughts turrets and guns merely received higher priority {{than those of the}} earlier ships.|$|E
5|$|This {{resistance}} to extreme environments has made archaea {{the focus of}} speculation about the possible properties of extraterrestrial life. Some extremophile habitats are not dissimilar to those on Mars, leading to the <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> viable microbes could be transferred between planets in meteorites.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{disallowance}} {{of banking}} bills {{put an end}} to any real chance of social credit being implemented at the provincial level, the Social Credit Board persisted until 1948, when it was dissolved in response to a number of its anti-semitic pronouncements and its <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> the secret ballot and political parties be eliminated.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} 27 Milky Way neighbors {{found that in}} all dwarf galaxies, the central mass is {{approximately}} 10 million solar masses, {{regardless of whether the}} galaxy has thousands or millions of stars. This has led to the <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> galaxies are largely formed by dark matter, and that the minimum size may indicate a form of warm dark matter incapable of gravitational coalescence on a smaller scale.|$|E
5|$|As he {{was unable}} to travel during 1916, Kropotkin found himself in {{frequent}} correspondence with others, including Jean Grave, who visited Kropotkin from France with his wife. Together, they discussed the war and Kropotkin's firm support for it. At Kropotkin's <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> he would like to have been a combatant were he younger, Grave suggested publishing a document urging anarchists to support the war effort {{on the side of the}} Allied Powers. Initially hesitant, due to his personal inability to sign up for active duty, Kropotkin was eventually persuaded by Grave.|$|E

5|$|Folk {{tales and}} myths {{sometimes}} contain mythological hybrids; the Minotaur was {{the offspring of}} a human, Pasiphaë, and a white bull. More often, they are composites of the physical attributes {{of two or more}} kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and humans, with no <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> they are the result of interbreeding, as in the centaur (man/horse), chimera (goat/lion/snake), hippocamp (fish/horse), and sphinx (woman/lion). The Old Testament mentions a first generation of half-human hybrid giants, the Nephilim, while the apocryphal Book of Enoch describes the Nephilim as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.|$|E
5|$|Gigantic and {{visually}} impressive, the Megalosaurus {{became one of}} the park's three 'mascot dinosaurs' along with the Iguanodon and (less so) the Ichthyosaurs. Working from fragmentary evidence from Jurassic fossils found in England, consisting mainly of a hip and femur (thigh bone), with a rib and a few vertebrae, Owen conjectured the animal was quadrupedal; palaeontologists now believe it to have been bipedal (standing like Tyrannosaurus rex). The first <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> some dinosaurs might have been bipedal came in 1858, just too late to influence the model.|$|E
5|$|Hindu scriptures, {{dated to}} between 5th century and 1st century BC, while {{discussing}} human diet, initially suggest kosher meat may be eaten, evolving {{it with the}} <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, then that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.|$|E

There had been <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> Sheffer was ill; {{there were also}} <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> {{he had taken a}} leave to undergo gastric bypass surgery. However, no statements confirming the reason for his leave have been made. Before being placed on a 17-week sabbatical, Sheffer had been unhappy at ATWT as a planned two-year storyline was cut short by higher-ups.|$|R

5|$|In 1945, Glenn Seaborg, an American scientist, {{made the}} <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> the {{actinide}} elements, like the lanthanides, were filling an f sub-level. Before {{this time the}} actinides {{were thought to be}} forming a fourth d-block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it would most likely ruin his career. As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to bring into disrepute, he published anyway. Seaborg's suggestion was found to be correct and he subsequently {{went on to win the}} 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing actinide elements.|$|E
5|$|Jose Brandao, a {{historian}} specializing in North American Native history, suggests that contemporary {{analyses of the}} Lachine Massacre continue to demonstrate cultural bias. Brandao criticizes historians Parkman, Charles McIlwain, and George Hunt for citing the growing dependence on European goods (which were, according to these historians, viewed by the Iroquois as superior to other goods) {{as a reason for}} Iroquois dissatisfaction and violence. Brandao dismisses this theory as a largely ethnocentric interpretation with little evidence to support it. Brandao also dismisses Hunt’s <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> natives, similar to the Europeans, waged wars for economic reasons.|$|E
5|$|Kouandété {{launched}} another coup against Soglo on December 17, but he {{was forced}} to hand power to Alley two days later. His administration oversaw {{the creation of a new}} constitution and a presidential election, Dahomey's first since 1964. The results were annulled because of a boycott that prevented almost three-quarters of the country from voting. Alley lost popularity with the <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> the military should retreat back to the barracks, and was eventually reduced to a mouthpiece for Kouandété. On July 17, 1968, Alley was forced to hand power to Emile Zinsou, a veteran politician.|$|E
