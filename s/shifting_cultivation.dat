Land was inherited through the sons, and if there was no son in the family, it was taken by a close male relative. In less populated areas, women do more agricultural work than men because of <b>shifting</b> <b>cultivation.</b> In more populated areas, men do more work than women because extensive plough cultivation is used. Female involvement is high in the double-cropping rice area.

5|$|However, modern {{agriculture}} seriously reduces biodiversity. Traditional {{third world}} agriculture that is best at maintaining diversity with multiple cropping systems such aspolyculture(includingcompanion plantingandintercropping) andagroforestrysystems such as <b>shifting</b> <b>cultivation.</b> In Latin America, between 70% and 90% of beans are grown mixed with other {{crops such as}} maize and potatoes. Worldwide, multiple cropping provided up to 20% of all food in 1986. Traditional systems also maintain diversity within a crop species, such as in theAndesmountains where up to 50 varieties of potato are grown.The effects of loss of biodiversity are especially noticeable in pest control. Herbivorous pest insects tend to become more abundant inmonocultures. Stable agroecosystems are biodiverse and contain sufficient numbers of natural enemies of crop pests, such asparasitoidalwasps which are able to controlaphidsandlepidopterancaterpillars. These ecosystems continuously provide food and breeding sites for these beneficial species. Agroecosystems can achieve this equilibrium by arranging a suitable combination of crops in space and time, given the type of soil and surrounding environment; sufficient abundance of non-crop plants in and around fields; and appropriate management of vegetation. Suitable farming strategies include polyculture,crop rotation, mosaics of small scattered fields and uncultivated land. Additional strategies include perennial crops such asorchards(especially if a diverse floral undergrowth is permitted), tolerating specific weed species, and raising genetic diversity such as by planting mixtures of crop varieties.|$|E

In addressing this question we employ a CGE model. The results show that the peso devaluation would adversely affect many manufacturing sectors. This in turn forces low skilled workers to the countryside thereby increasing agricultural production at the expense of land now covered by tropical forests. Since many of these migrants have little skill at cultivating such marginal lands, they <b>shift</b> <b>cultivation</b> in a manner which increases runoff and has a negative impact on the size, quality, and value of tropical forests.

Approximately 15,000 square kilometers of forest land is under jhum cultivation, and just a sixth of this land is actually producing any crop at any given year. The tribal people consider it a tradition, and economic ecosystem. However, the slash and burn causes damage to a dense forest, to soil, to flora and fauna, as well as pollution.
