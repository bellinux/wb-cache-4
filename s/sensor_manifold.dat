50|$|The {{most notable}} {{change of the}} RC45 when {{released}} {{was the use of}} Programmed Fuel Injection. Fuel injection had been used on bikes previously but these had either been rather antiquated analog computers or very simple digital units with a minimal number of sensors for input, which resulted in very crude fueling. The RC30 had used 38 mm constant velocity carburettors which, for road use are quite nice, maintaining a high air velocity across a wide rpm range, though were not as well suited for racing. The RC45 did away with carburetors and in their absence a brace of four 46 mm throttles were replaced, Honda now had the throttle area it needed to make big horsepower at high revolutions. The system Honda used on the RC45 was very similar to the system used on the NR750. Contrary to popular belief the RC45’s fuel injection is not like a 4-stage carburetor, rather it is a proper fuel only system. Honda kept the ignition system separate. The Honda system obtained information from the following sensors: crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, air temperature sensor, coolant temperature <b>sensor,</b> <b>manifold</b> absolute pressure sensor, throttle position sensor, barometric sensor and battery voltage. With all of these sensors relaying information to the ECU, Honda could have quite easily incorporated the ignition control unit. The reason that they had not came down to the supplier of parts: they had different manufacturers supplying the ecu and cdi units. Regardless, it allowed the use of very large throttle plates seamlessly over a very wide engine operating range. The engine of the RC45 also used many magnesium castings, as of rather recently, it has become quite common to see fuel injection and magnesium engine parts on motorcycles, though in the early-to-mid 1990’s this was expensive and incredibly innovative.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} methods {{to build a}} SOM {{that can be used}} as an isometric map for mobile robots. That is, given a dataset of sensor readings collected at points uniformly distributed with respect to the ground, we wish to build a SOM whose neurons (prototype vectors in sensor space) correspond to points uniformly distributed on the ground. Manifold learning techniques have already been used for dimensionality reduction of sensor space in navigation systems. Our focus is on the isometric property of the SOM. For reliable path-planning and information sharing between several robots, it is desirable that the robots build an internal representation of the <b>sensor</b> <b>manifold,</b> a map, that is isometric with the environment. We show experimentally that standard Non-Linear Dimensionality Reduction (NLDR) algorithms do not provide isometric maps for range data and bearing data. However, the auxiliary low dimensional manifolds created can be used to improve the distribution of the neurons of a SOM (that is, make the neurons more evenly distributed with respect to the ground).

While these systems may be feasible for large commercial or government programs to execute, they are impractical for micro- and nano-satellite systems. In particular, these small spacecraft cannot utilize classical hazardous or high-pressure components, as small satellites are often hosted as secondary payloads with stringent restrictions imposed. In contrast to this paradigm, an effort to develop, manufacture, and validate a low-cost propulsion system suitable for small, secondary payloads was pursued. Intended for orbit insertion, stationkeeping, and de-orbit operations, this system was developed to operate within the typical constraints of a small satellite. In addition to the aforementioned cost and safety concerns, small satellites possess limited mass, volume, and electrical power. Given these considerations, a straightforward warm gas system was chosen, with liquid butane as propellant. This configuration is not only inherently simple, but can also be manufactured using primarily off-theshelf components, which can be quickly procured in small quantities.

40|$|Abstract. The neural {{representation}} {{of space in}} rats has inspired many navigation systems for robots. In particular, Self-Organizing (Feature) Maps (SOM) are often used to {{give a sense of}} location to robots by mapping sensor information to a low-dimensional grid. For example, a robot equipped with a panoramic camera can build a 2 D SOM from vectors of landmark bearings. If there are four landmarks in the robot’s environment, then the 2 D SOM is embedded in a 2 D manifold lying in a 4 D space. In general, the set of observable sensor vectors form a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold in a high-dimensional space. In a landmark bearing <b>sensor</b> space, the <b>manifold</b> can have a large curvature in some regions (when the robot is near a landmark for example), making the Eulidian distance a very poor approximation of the Riemannian metric.

Multi-antenna and multi-carrier communications provide both theoretically attractive and technically practical solutions to satisfy these requirements. This thesis aims at designing and studying advanced algorithms for Multi-antenna and multi-carrier communications. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we propose bandwidth-efficient blind spatial signature estimation algorithms based on time-varying user power loading and parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis. Compared with the earlier approaches, our algorithms do not require any knowledge of the propagation channel and/or <b>sensor</b> array <b>manifold</b> and are applicable to more general class of scenarios. In the second part of the thesis, blind multiuser separation-detection algorithms for direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems based on the robust fitting of PARAFAC models are proposed. These algorithms provide an improved bandwidth efficiency and robustness against impulsive ambient noise as compared with the earlier approaches. The third part of the thesis is devoted to linear multiuser receivers for joint space-time decoding and interference rejection in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems that use orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs) and erroneous channel state information (CSI). Using different approaches to model the CSI mismatch, robust linear receivers based on worst-case performance optimization and stochastic programming are proposed, respectively. The proposed receivers greatly enhance the robustness of the communication systems against CSI mismatches. The fourth part of the thesis focuses on the issue of channel fading mitigation for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems. In particular, a new linear block precoding technique based on the maximization of the mean cutoff rate is developed. Compared with the earlier precoding techniques, our precoder provides better performance and requires less channel knowledge at the transmitter. Also, adaptive approaches for OFDM-based communication systems are studied in the case when the transmitter has only one bit of CSI per subcarrier obtained through a low-rate feedback. Optimal parameters for these adaptive algorithms are derived. Imperfections of the feedback channel are considered and their impact on the performance of the adaptive techniques is investigated...|$|R

In this work, we focus on learning low-dimensional linear {{statistics of}} high-dimensional measurement data along with decision rules defined in the low-dimensional space in the case when the probability density of the measurements and class labels is not given, but a training set of samples from this distribution is given. We pose a joint optimization problem for linear dimensionality reduction and margin-based classification, and develop a coordinate descent algorithm on the Stiefel manifold for its solution. Although the coordinate descent is not guaranteed to find the globally optimal solution, crucially, its alternating structure enables us to extend it for sensor networks with a message-passing approach requiring little communication. Linear dimensionality reduction prevents overfitting when learning from finite training data. In the sensor network setting, dimensionality reduction not only prevents overfitting, but also reduces power consumption due to communication. The learned reduced-dimensional space and decision rule is shown to be consistent and its Rademacher complexity is characterized. Experimental results are presented for a variety of datasets, including those from existing sensor networks, demonstrating the potential of our methodology in comparison with other dimensionality reduction approaches.

The Rheingans frequency is the dominant frequency while operating at part load. The runner frequency displays a high intensity at both part- and high- load The runner vane frequency shows a high intensity at the outlet of the turbine. The analysis of the pressure intensity shows the highest pressure pulsations measured for BEP, part load and high load are respectively 45 kPa, 250 kPa, 55 kPa. The sensors located closest to the inner radius of the draft tube bend experience a lower intensity than the sensors at the outer radius of the bend. This is probably a flow-specific phenomenon that occurs in the draft tube bend. Air injection into the draft tube is installed to reduce the intensity of pressure pulsations that occur during part load. Data with and without air injection from two operating point at 0. 46 *Qn and 0. 58 *Qn, have been compared. The analysis shows that the air injection reduces the overall intensity by 22 % at 0. 46 *Qn and 10 % at 0. 58 *Qn. The most powerful pulsations are reduced by 20 % to 60 %, while the remaining pulsations experienced a change from - 14 % to 17 %. Frequency analysis at part load 0. 46 *Qn, show two distinct frequencies at 4. 64 Hz and 5. 06 Hz when the turbine runs without air injection. When air is injected into the draft tube, these frequencies disappear altogether. The frequencies are probably related to elastic fluctuations in the system, which are damped by the injected air...|$|R
