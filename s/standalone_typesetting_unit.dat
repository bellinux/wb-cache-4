5000|$|Three villas {{left over}} from the old resort, known as the Upper, Middle and Lower Villas, stand below Bonnie View. They have been used as {{executive}} apartments by David Miscavige and other senior figures. Alongside the Villas is the Star of California, a replica clipper ship now used as a site for community events. Other buildings located nearby include the [...] "Ranchos", a cluster of buildings used to house the book compilation, editing, design and <b>typesetting</b> <b>units,</b> the [...] "Del Sol" [...] building (formerly the Hotel Del Sol) used for staff training and various additional facilities for Golden Era Studios.|$|R
50|$|A RIP can be {{implemented}} either as a software component of an operating system or as a firmware program executed on a microprocessor inside a printer, though for high-end <b>typesetting,</b> <b>standalone</b> hardware RIPs are sometimes used. Ghostscript and GhostPCL are examples of software RIPs. Every PostScript printer contains a RIP in its firmware.|$|R
50|$|Typographic {{units are}} the units of {{measurement}} used in typography or <b>typesetting.</b> Traditional typometry <b>units</b> are different from familiar metric units because they were established {{in the early days}} of printing. Though most printing is digital now, the old terms and units have persisted.|$|R
40|$|The siunitx package {{provides}} a powerful toolkit for <b>typesetting</b> numbers and <b>units</b> in LATEX. By incorporating {{detail about the}} agreed rules for presenting scientific data, siunitx enables authors {{to concentrate on the}} meaning of their input and leave the package to deal with the formatting. Version 2 of siunitx increases the scope of the package and is intended to act as a solid base for further development. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Typesetting</b> {{values with}} <b>units</b> {{requires}} care {{to ensure that}} the combined mathe-matical meaning of the value plus unit combination is clear. In particular, the SI units system lays down a consistent set of units with rules on how these are to be used. However, different countries and publishers have differing conventions on the exact appearance of numbers (and units). The siunitx package provides a set of tools for authors to <b>typeset</b> numbers and <b>units</b> in a consistent way. The package has an extended set of configuration options which make it possible to follow varying typographic conventions with the same input syntax. The package includes automated processing of numbers and units, and the ability to control tabular alignment of numbers. A number of LATEX packages have been developed in the past for formatting units: SIunits, SIstyle, unitsdef, units, fancyunits and fancynum. Support for users of all of these packages is available as emulation modules in siunitx. In addition, siunitx can carry out many of the functions of the dcolumn, rccol and numprint packages...|$|R
25|$|In hand writing, a {{ligature}} is made {{by joining}} two or more characters in atypical fashion by merging their parts or by writing one above or inside the other. While in printing, a ligature {{is a group of}} characters that is <b>typeset</b> as a <b>unit,</b> and the characters {{do not have to be}} joined. For example, in some cases the fi ligature prints the letters f and i with a greater separation than when they are typeset as separate letters. When printing with movable type was invented around 1450, typefaces included many ligatures and additional letters, as they were based on handwriting. Ligatures made printing with movable type easier because one block would replace frequent combinations of letters and also allowed more complex and interesting character designs which would otherwise collide with one another.|$|R
40|$|Physical {{quantities}} {{have both}} numbers and units, and each physical quantity should be expressed {{as the product}} of a number and a <b>unit.</b> <b>Typesetting</b> physical quantities requires care to ensure that the combined mathematical meaning of the number–unit combination is clear. In particular, the SI units system lays down a consistent set of units with rules on how these are to be used. However, different countries and publishers have differing conventions on the exact appearance of numbers (and units). The siunitx package provides a set of tools for authors to typeset quantities in a consistent way.

40|$|<b>Typesetting</b> {{values with}} <b>units</b> {{requires}} care {{to ensure that}} the combined mathematical meaning of the value plus unit combination is clear. In particu-lar, the SI units system lays down a consistent set of units with rules on how these are to be used. However, different countries and publishers have differ-ing conventions on the exact appearance of numbers (and units). A number of LATEX packages have been developed to provide consistent application of the various rules: SIunits, sistyle, unitsdef and units are the leading examples. The numprint package provides a large number of number-related functions, while dcolumn and rccol provide tools for typesetting tabular numbers. The si package takes the best from the existing packages, and adds new features and a consistent interface. A number of new ideas have been in-corporated, to fill gaps in the existing provision. The package also provides backward-compatibility with SIunits, sistyle, unitsdef and units. The aim is to have one package to handle all of the possible unit-related needs of LATE...|$|R
40|$|A Dictionary of South African English on Historical Principles (DSAEHist) {{is rooted}} in {{quotation}} evidence. It contains just over 8 000 South African English entries, with about 45 000 citations to support those words included as headwords in the dictionary. Using the legacy electronic format in which DSAEHist was <b>typeset,</b> the Dictionary <b>Unit</b> for South African English embarked on a digitising process of DSAEHist, during which {{it became clear that}} the quotations would benefit from a full review involving the verification of all quotations against their original sources. This article examines the evolution of the quotation verification project from its beginnings as an entirely manual exercise to its current use of software developed for the purpose. Some of the project’s achievements, such as antedatings and primary source identification, are highlighted, and challenges, such as unverifiable quotations and sometimes highly convoluted research paths, are described. In addition to this, the article looks at the necessarily systematic nature of quotation handling and the main types of considerations determining methodology (for example, lexicographic, bibliographic and typographic requirements) ...|$|R
