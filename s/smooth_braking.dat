5000|$|The Firestorm 10T is an {{off-road}} 2wd nitro powered stadium truck. It has {{a powerful}} G3.0 engine developing 2.2 bhp at 31,000 rpm, with dual-stage foam air filter and race-style carburetor for maximum performance. Suspension designed for ultimate control and grip in any off-road situation. The composite shock bodies are threaded for infinite adjustability and fitted with tuned racing springs. Low-profile fuel tank incorporates a stone fuel filter and sits {{in the middle of}} the chassis for perfect weight balance at all times. Fiber brake disk with piston actuation for strong, <b>smooth</b> <b>braking.</b> Low profile 75cc fuel tank included for a lower center of gravity.|$|E
50|$|With {{adjustable}} +/- trailer braking gain in {{a digital}} readout from 0.0 (no trailer brakes) to 10.0 (full trailer braking) in 0.5 increments and a manual override lever (to test trailer braking action), the Ford 'built into the dash' TBC provides <b>smooth</b> <b>braking</b> even when pulling up to a 15,000 lb 4-axle conventional (receiver mounted) or 26,000 lb 4-axle 5th Wheel (bed/frame mounted) trailer. TowCommand being different from most aftermarket TBCs, ties into the trucks' computer and hydraulics, so it senses truck brake pressure and can apply trailer brakes {{as fast as the}} truck's brakes. Master Brake Systems 'BrakeSmart' TBC is the only other TBC that taps into the trucks hydraulic lines in modern trucks.|$|E
40|$|Eddy current brakes (ECB) utilise {{electromagnets}} {{to generate}} <b>smooth</b> <b>braking</b> torque {{in contrast with}} traditional friction braking. A disadvantage is the low braking forces experienced at low speeds and as a consequence, the moving object never ceases its motion.  The aim {{of this research is}} to develop and construct an electrically controlled ECB for research on an application specific motor at Charles Darwin University (CDU).  A literature review was conducted into previous works on ECBs and three theoretical models were identified. Between the models Schieber, Smythe and Wouterse, the Wouterse method appeared most appropriate as it is both simple and applicable for this application.  The determination of the magnetisation curve of the core material provides the characteristics required to design the ECB. The load line was determined for specific currents to provide a theoretical flux density in the air gap. These values were also confirmed experimentally. The design indicated that in order to achieve the required specifications and constraints, a large number of turns and core would be required. The final constructed design was tested using the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) at CDU to confirm the simulated torque, speed and current values.  In order to confirm the flux travelling through the air gap, a Gaussmeter was used to experimentally measure the flux. The results for the torque versus speed was collected using Labview. This provided torque and speed readings through a torque sensor and incremental encoder. As the aluminium disc did not completely occupy the cross sectional area of the core’s air gap, the results confirm that in order to achieve the simulated results, the current required will need to be increased...|$|E
5000|$|For {{a driver}} this car is delightful. All the {{controls}} operate with refined efficiency {{and the engine}} is full of life. The suspension is good. The character of the engine, strong yet <b>smooth</b> <b>brakes,</b> light steering and the car’s steadiness on the road make the 25 require only the little effort enough for a small car.

25|$|By 1910, an {{improved}} braking schedule had been introduced, known as AMRE. This setup, and all others to come after, permitted graduated {{release of the}} brakes for finer control of brake applications. Additionally, AMRE allowed for the electric synchronization of braking throughout an entire train, causing all brakes on all cars of the train to apply uniformly and simultaneously. This created a <b>smoother</b> <b>braking</b> effort throughout the train. In order for the electric synchronization to work, {{it was necessary to}} insert an electric brake key to activate the feature. All of the older IRT cars, including the Composites, were refitted with the new AMRE system circa 1910.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of automated systems {{can make an}} important contribution towards increasing the efficiency and sustainability of large and small mining operations. Automation can {{improve the quality of}} work for employees by reducing exposure to unhealthy or unsafe environments, and its introduction into mining operations provides opportunities for training and capacity-building. Autonomous haul trucks ensure consistent driving conditions (<b>smoother</b> <b>braking</b> and accelerating) reducing fuel consumption which results in significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. Furthermore, vehicle maintenance is more predictable and better-controlled. Automated systems increase productivity and efficiency, thereby making projects more economically feasible. Timing and social issues are major considerations when implementing automated systems. Understanding the social, environmental and economic issues surrounding automation and its contributions to the extractive industry prepares a mining project to be successful with this added opportunity of automation impacting on principles of sustainability...|$|R
50|$|In 1993, the Wild Mouse reopened at Idlewild. The {{track was}} {{originally}} painted a rust red with black supports when the ride {{first moved to}} Idlewild.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effects of a two-day post-license driver-training program on brake {{performance}} in cars with antilock braking systems (ABS). A trainee group (n = 26) and a control group (n = 13) participated in the experiment. The trainee group were enrolled in a two-day training course that included instruction in a braking technique that may be used in cars with and without ABS. All participants performed emergency brake tests from 80 and 100 km h- 1 in an instrumented car before and after the training period. Results indicated the post-training group used a <b>smoother</b> <b>braking</b> profile, were less reliant on ABS activation, had enhanced postural stability, but took about one car length longer to stop from 100 km h- 1 compared with the control group. Implications of these results for braking in cars with and without ABS, and for driver education programs in general are discussed. No Full Tex...|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, Dorney went [...] "green" [...] and transplanted 120 30-year-old {{trees to}} make shade. It {{also made the}} park look nicer. Construction began on a steel hypercoaster {{slightly}} over 200 ft tall. It was designed by D.H. Morgan, a former employee of Arrow. Morgan helped design Magnum XL-200 at Cedar Point in 1988. This coaster would have a similar out and back layout but would have a <b>smoother</b> <b>braking</b> system and be a more pleasant ride than Magnum. It opened {{in an area that}} was previously considered the front of the park taking up that entire stretch of land. This coaster is known as Steel Force and opened in the spring of 1997. This brought the park up to four adult coasters and a kiddie coaster. At that point, the former front entrance was restricted to employees and was now considered the back entrance. Over the years, the waterpark added some newer water slides as well as a second lazy river.|$|R

25|$|From 1979 to 1984, Z3-class trams were introduced. They have an {{additional}} door {{on each side}} of the tram, no conductor's console was provided, and <b>smoother</b> acceleration and <b>braking</b> compared to the Z1-class. 115 were built, 112 of which are in service.|$|R
5000|$|Gear {{change is}} <b>smooth</b> and easy, <b>brakes</b> and {{suspension}} are excellent, {{the engine runs}} without noise and vibration. The reviewer described it as [...] "a common-sense motor-car". The price of the chassis is £375. Using a catchphrase of the day—it wouldn't pull the skin off a rice pudding.|$|R
5000|$|Braking was tremendously {{improved}} on Standards, as electropneumatic brakes synchronized the {{braking effort}} of every {{car in the}} train to provide a faster braking response. This newer type of braking, WABCO schedule AMUE, would be standard in New York's subways through the 1930s, and lasted in limited quantity until as late as 1977 (when the R1-R9s, {{the last of the}} prewar cars, were retired from service). Additionally, a [...] "Variable Load" [...] feature automatically adjusted each car's braking effort to compensate for uneven passenger loads in different cars throughout the train. The result was a <b>smooth,</b> uniform <b>braking</b> effort that increased passenger comfort.|$|R

40|$|A {{roller coaster}} ride {{comes to an}} end. Magnets on the train induce eddy {{currents}} in the braking fins, giving a <b>smooth</b> rise in <b>braking</b> force as the remaining kinetic energy is absorbed by the brakes and converted to thermal energy. In this paper an IR camera was used to monitor {{the temperature of the}} first braking fin, before, during and after the passage of a train. In addition, the resulting acceleration of the train was modelled and compared to accelerometer data for the Kanonen roller coaster in Liseberg.

50|$|Although {{externally}} {{very similar}} to the preceding Z1 and Z2-class trams they had significant design differences, and were a significant improvement on the Z1 and Z2-class trams. They are fitted with AEG control equipment and Duewag bogies, have an additional door each side (for a total of three rather than two for the Z1 and Z2), drop down (as opposed to top sliding) Beclawat windows and improved headlights. The unreliable flap type destination displays and route number indicators were replaced by rollable plastic film destination displays. They also had much <b>smoother</b> acceleration and <b>braking</b> performance, and improved suspension. The Z3-class build process went smoothly, with few problems, bar a slow delivery of equipment from AEG, and a few minor faults that required remedying after construction.|$|R
40|$|Precision {{stopping}} is {{an important}} automated vehicle control function that is critical in applications such as precision bus docking, automated truck or bus fueling, as well as automatic intersection, or toll booth stopping. The initial applications of this technology {{are most likely to}} be applied to heavy-duty vehicles such as buses or trucks. Such applications require specific attention to brake control since the characteristics of a typical pneumatic brake system of a heavy vehicle is inherently nonlinear with large uncertainties. The feasibility of providing a <b>smooth</b> precision stopping <b>brake</b> control based on a conventional pneumatic brake system has not yet been demonstrated.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{the need}} for safety of {{vehicles}} by reducing the impact of crash by applying a <b>smooth</b> or partial <b>braking</b> with the help PIC 16 F 877 a micro controller is proposed. The driver’s risk of measuring a certain object from a particular distance and failing to notice within the critical limit such conditions are met while designing this work. Once a similar situation is faced the acceleration of the automobile will be directly controlled without disturbing the safe throttle (actual throttle mechanism) of the automobile, the designed machine itself takes the control of acceleration pedal if the brake is not applied within the critical distance. The method is proposed {{in such a way}} to be applied to both low cost and existing vehicles as these were already build for the Indian roads.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors {{describe}} a possibility to use adaptive control algorithms for a train braking system. The following assumptions were put forward: a {{programmable logic controller}} (PLC) or microcontroller with a control program based on an adaptive control algorithm and a current train braking control system ensures an automatic <b>smooth</b> and precise <b>braking</b> of a train; and another controller with a smaller footprint connected to the same train braking system ensures an automatic {{stopping of the train}} before the red light. Some of the available adaptive search algorithms are discussed and the one which is the most suitable and the most effective of them for this task is selected. The authors designed the control program for a PLC and other controller and carried out the first testing of the developed system. In the conclusion of the article there is an analysis of the results and an evaluation of the selected control algorithms effectiveness...|$|R
50|$|Magnetic brakes {{are silent}} and are much <b>smoother</b> than {{friction}} <b>brakes,</b> gradually increasing the braking power {{so that the}} people on the ride do not experience rapid changes in deceleration. Many modern roller coasters, especially those being manufactured by Intamin, have utilized magnetic braking for several years. Another major roller coaster designer implementing these brakes is Bolliger & Mabillard in 2004 on their Silver Bullet inverted coaster, making it the first inverted roller coaster to feature magnetic brakes, and again used them on their newer projects, such as Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland. These later applications have proven effectively comfortable and relevant for these inverted coasters which often give the sense of flight. There also exist third party companies such as Magnetar Technologies Corp. which provide various configurations of the technology to be used to replace and retrofit braking systems on existing roller coasters to increase safety, improve rider comfort, and lower maintenance costs and labor.|$|R
5000|$|The Water Tank Challenge: The {{candidates}} must drive {{a modified}} PT Cruiser with a roof-mounted water tank smoothly through a course {{to avoid getting}} wet. Despite resolving to not get wet at all, Andrew is splashed for the fifth {{year in a row}} after taking a slalom turn too wide. Margherita is the first candidate to take the challenge, and ends up spilling much of her water on {{at the end of the}} initial straight by braking too late. Cheryl gets splashed the most during their run, causing her to accuse Margherita of doing it on purpose; she loses 80 litres during the challenge, most of which was lost at the start and at the end when she backed into a concrete barrier. Diane makes a similar mistake at the start of her run, braking too late and losing a lot of water; after that she doesn't take the challenge very seriously and ends up losing a total of 70 litres. Kevin is the third driver in a row to brake too late at the start, with predictable results. Though the exact amount of water that he lost was not revealed, Andrew specified that his run was easily the worst in rehab, losing more water than anyone else and causing the most damage to the course. Klyne lapses into his speeding habits again, leading to Maureen getting heavily soaked, though the rest of his run is relatively smooth and he loses just 40 litres. Azim has a less than <b>smooth</b> run, <b>braking</b> too sharply at the beginning and repeatedly going off-course in the reversing section, resulting in him losing 70 litres. Flora's erratic acceleration results in her losing a lot of water on the opening straight, and to add insult to injury she has to re-take it because she didn't drive at the required 50 km/h. She ultimately lost 80 litres, though the experts noted that she was starting to fight back against Frank's attempts to micro-manage her.|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of {{adaptive}} cruise control (ACC) system two separate control loops - an outer loop to maintain the safe distance from the vehicle traveling in front and an inner loop to control the brake pedal and throttle opening position - are commonly used. In this paper a different approach is proposed in which a single control loop is utilized. The objective of the distance tracking is incorporated into the single nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) by extending the original linear time invariant (LTI) models obtained by linearizing the nonlinear dynamic model of the vehicle. This is achieved by introducing the additional states corresponding to the relative distance between leading and following vehicles, and also the velocity of the leading vehicle. Control of the brake and throttle position is implemented by taking the state-dependent approach. The model demonstrates {{to be more effective}} in tracking the speed and distance by eliminating the necessity of switching between the two controllers. It also offers <b>smooth</b> variation in <b>brake</b> and throttle controlling signal which subsequently results in a more uniform acceleration of the vehicle. The results of proposed method are compared with other ACC systems using two separate control loops. Furthermore, an ACC simulation results using a stop&go scenario are shown, demonstrating a better fulfilment of the design requirements...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis deals with the design and real-time implementation of a control system for a new configuration of two-wheeled robot. In real life applications, two wheeled robots are considered to carry payloads of different sizes at different positions anddifferent motion speeds along the vertical axis. Such parameters {{will have an impact}} on the robot stability and the control mechanism, hence their detailed study is essential for robust performance of the system. This workinvestigates the impact of the dynamic change of the payload position on the system damping characteristics whilstthe robot is in its balancing state. A mathematical model isdeveloped to describe and study the dynamics of the two-wheeled robot system. Accurate tilt angle measurement is achieved through applying a sensor fusion realized by complementary filter. A PID control strategy is considered to balance and position the robot assuming a fixed location of the payload. Then the controller isextended to provide the robot with the ability of self-standing fromits rest position withouthuman interaction. The developed controller and the sensor fusion filter are implemented on a microcontroller development board. The results show that the implementation of the controller fulfils the requirement to balance the robot. The two-wheeled robot test rig was modified to accommodate the payload actuation unit and improve the overall performance. Consequentially, the controller of the robot is also modified with the sensor fusion algorithm enhanced by implementing Kalman filter. The controller comprise a PID feedback with a feedforward approach. Furthermore, gain scheduling approach is utilized to ensure <b>smooth</b> and fast <b>braking</b> of the two-wheeled robotThe control approachis extended to an intelligent controller, where a PD-like fuzzy controller is design. A binary coding technique is developed forreal-time implementation of the fuzzy controller. Such coding and implementation eliminates the need to store a biglookup table for the controllerrules. The controlleris tested in laboratory experimentsanditsrobustness is demonstrated with application of various disturbance forces on the system. In order to evaluate the performance of the new configuration two-wheeled robot, various experiments are conducted under different conditions. The resultsdemonstrate that the proposed two-wheeled robot configuration and the proposed control approaches form a solid foundation and aframework for assisted mobility of disabled and elderly peopl...|$|R
