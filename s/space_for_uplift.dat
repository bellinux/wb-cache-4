40|$|Generation of tsunamis by slow {{submarine}} processes (faulting, slumps or slides) is investigated, {{in search}} for possible amplification mechanisms resulting from lateral spreading of the sea floor uplift. A linearized solution for constant water depth is derived by transform methods (Laplace in time and Fourier in <b>space),</b> <b>for</b> sea floor <b>uplift</b> represented by a sliding Heaviside step function (i. e. a simplified Haskell source model, with zero rise time). The model is used to study the tsunami amplitude amplification (wave amplitude normalized by the final sea floor uplift) {{as a function of}} the model parameters. The results show that, above the source, the amplification is larger <b>for</b> larger <b>uplifted</b> area and <b>for</b> smaller water depth, and is the largest in the direction of <b>uplift</b> spreading, <b>for</b> velocity of spreading comparable to the long period tsunami velocity. Near the source, this amplification could be one order of magnitude. This amplification mechanism seen in the near-field is a form of wave focusing, and is manifested by a high frequency pulse, with amplitude attenuating with distance due to dispersion and geometric spreading. In the far-field, the linear theory predicts maximum amplification equal to one, as predicted by point source models. An analogy between this form of focusing and resonance of a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator, and near-field radiation patterns are discussed. The magnitudes, seismic movements and source durations of selected earthquakes which generated tsunamis are cited in search of condition...|$|R

40|$|Randomized {{experiments}} {{have been critical}} tools of decision making for decades. However, subjects can show significant heterogeneity in response to treatments in many important applications. Therefore {{it is not enough}} to simply know which treatment is optimal for the entire population. What we need is a model that correctly customize treatment assignment base on subject characteristics. The problem of constructing such models from randomized experiments data is known as Uplift Modeling in the literature. Many algorithms have been proposed <b>for</b> <b>uplift</b> modeling and some have generated promising results on various data sets. Yet little is known about the theoretical properties of these algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new tree-based ensemble algorithm <b>for</b> <b>uplift</b> modeling. Experiments show that our algorithm can achieve competitive results on both synthetic and industry-provided data. In addition, by properly tuning the "node size" parameter, our algorithm is proved to be consistent under mild regularity conditions. This is the first consistent algorithm <b>for</b> <b>uplift</b> modeling that we are aware of. Comment: Accepted by 2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Minin...|$|R
