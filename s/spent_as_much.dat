5|$|Gorgosaurus <b>spent</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as {{half its}} {{life in the}} {{juvenile}} phase before ballooning up to near-maximum size {{in only a few}} years. This, along with the complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests that these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids. This pattern is seen in modern Komodo dragons, whose hatchlings start off as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates. Other tyrannosaurids, including Albertosaurus, have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs, but {{there is no evidence of}} gregarious behavior in Gorgosaurus.|$|E

5|$|These {{measures}} were introduced {{due to the}} collapse of the army during the Soviet intervention. Before the invasion the army could field 100,000 troops, after the invasion only 25,000. Desertions were pandemic, and the recruitment campaigns for young people often drove them to the opposition. To better organize the military, seven military zones were established, each with its own Defence Council. The Defence Councils were established at the national, provincial and district level to empower the local PDPA. It is estimated that the Afghan government <b>spent</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 40 percent of government revenue on defense.|$|E
5|$|Norman {{was born}} in Ulverston, Lancashire (now part of the {{administrative}} county of Cumbria), on 6 September 1883 to Thomas Birkett, a draper, and his wife Agnes, who died in 1884 of tuberculosis. He attended the Wesleyan primary school in Ulverston until 1894, {{when he moved to}} Barrow-in-Furness Grammar School. Although intelligent, Birkett was not noted as a particularly academic student and <b>spent</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> time on practical jokes as he did on his studies. He left school in 1898, starting work as an apprentice in one of the draper's shops owned by his father and beginning to preach. He was a popular local preacher on the local Methodist circuit, and, on deciding that he was unlikely to be a good draper, his father allowed him to leave the business in 1904 to become a minister under Charles Bedale. In 1905, Bedale suggested Birkett should go to Cambridge University to study history and theology. Birkett liked the idea, having previously conversed with A. C. Benson, the Master of Magdalene College, and applied to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. The college offered him a place, with the condition {{that he would have to}} pass an entrance examination and complete the responsions to be accepted into the university as a whole. He spent three months learning Latin and Greek and was accepted into the university in October 1907.|$|E

25|$|North American birders were {{estimated}} to have <b>spent</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as US$32 billion in 2001. The spending {{is on the rise}} around the world. Kuşcenneti National Park (KNP) at Lake Manyas, a Ramsar site in Turkey was estimated to attract birders who <b>spent</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as US$103,320,074 annually. Guided bird tours have become a major business with at least 127 companies offering tours worldwide. An average trip to a less-developed country costs $4000 per person and includes about 12 participants for each of 150 trips a year. It has been suggested that this economic potential needs to be tapped for conservation.|$|E

50|$|On {{the level}} of the household, AIDS results in both the loss of income and {{increased}} spending on healthcare by the household.

25|$|The {{family home}} was a small log house on Sandusky Street in Zanesfield.

He had a certain ability with horses and <b>spent</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> time caring for animals as he did in mending saddles. From a formula reportedly given to him by the Indians (though this is uncertain), Andrew made a strong-smelling brown concoction that was applied to horses' shoulders when they stiffened from the spring ploughing.

25|$|Bader's first wife, Thelma, {{developed}} throat {{cancer in}} 1967. Aware that her survival was unlikely, the two <b>spent</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> time {{with each other}} as possible. Thelma was a smoker, and although she stopped smoking, it did not save her. After a long battle, she died on 24 January 1971. Bader married Joan Murray (née Hipkiss) on 3 January 1973. They spent the remainder {{of their lives in}} the village of Marlston, Berkshire. Joan was the daughter of a steel tycoon. She had an interest in riding and {{was a member of the}} British Limbless Ex-Serviceman's Association. They first met at one of the association's events in 1960. She also helped associations involved in riding for the disabled.|$|E
25|$|On {{returning}} to London {{with his son}} in August 1827, Hazlitt was shocked to discover that his wife, still in Paris, was leaving him. He settled in modest lodgings on Half-Moon Street, and thereafter waged an unending battle against poverty, as he found himself forced to grind out a stream of mostly undistinguished articles for weeklies like The Atlas to generate desperately needed cash. Relatively little is known of Hazlitt's other activities in this period. He <b>spent</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> time, apparently, at Winterslow {{as he did in}} London. Some meditative essays emerged from this stay in his favourite country retreat, and he also made progress with his life of Napoleon. But he also found himself struggling against bouts of illness, nearly dying at Winterslow in December 1827. Two volumes—the first half—of the Napoleon biography appeared in 1828, only to have its publisher fail soon thereafter. This entailed even more financial difficulties for the author, and what little evidence we have of his activities at the time consists in large part of begging letters to publishers for advances of money.|$|E

500|$|Soundgarden {{began work}} on the album about two months after {{finishing}} its stint on the 1992 Lollapalooza tour. The individual band members would work on material {{on their own and}} then bring in demos to which {{the other members of the}} band would contribute. Frontman Chris Cornell said that the band members allowed each other more freedom than on past records. Thayil observed that even though the band <b>spent</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> time writing and arranging as it had on previous albums, it spent a lot more time working on recording the songs. [...] After two albums with producer Terry Date, the band decided to seek another collaborator, as guitarist Kim Thayil said, [...] "We just thought we'd go for a change." [...] Eventually they settled on producer Michael Beinhorn, who [...] "didn't have his own trademark sound which he was trying to tack on to Soundgarden" [...] and had ideas the band approved.|$|E
500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed". In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, [...] " [...] was a big effort for me to learn, I {{had to find a}} totally new approach to playing the double bass drums {{to be able to do}} that stuff. I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually <b>spent</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know if it was going to make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E

50|$|It's Garry Shandling's Show starred Garry Shandling as, more or less, himself: a neurotic, {{somewhat}} self-obsessed stand-up comedian, {{who just}} happens to be aware he is a TV sitcom character.
