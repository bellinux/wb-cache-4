5|$|Mammals in {{this area}} include bison, deer, pronghorn, coyotes, beavers, and prairie dogs, while {{reptiles}} include the <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle,</b> the box turtle, and various types of snakes. The prairie rattlesnake is South Dakota's only venomous snake. Rivers and lakes of the grasslands support populations of walleye, carp, pike, and bass, along with other species. The Missouri River also contains the pre-historic paddlefish, and chinook salmon, native to the Pacific Northwest, have been successfully introduced in Lake Oahe.|$|E
5|$|Two {{species are}} IUCN Vulnerable: the desert {{tortoise}} (California and Nevada) and the gopher tortoise (Georgia, also the official tortoise of Florida). Three species are Near Threatened: the diamondback terrapin (Maryland), the ornate box turtle (Kansas), {{and the common}} box turtle (Missouri with the three-toed subspecies, North Carolina and Tennessee with the eastern subspecies). All the remaining state reptile species are Least Concern. Interestingly, all the non-turtle reptiles fall into this category, but the only two turtles in relative safety are the common <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> (New York) and the painted turtle (Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Vermont).|$|E

50|$|Common <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> {{have few}} predators when older, but eggs {{are subject to}} {{predation}} by crows, mink, skunks, foxes, and raccoons. As hatchlings and juveniles, most of the same predators will attack {{them as well as}} herons (mostly great blue herons), bitterns, hawks, owls, fishers, bullfrogs, large fish, and snakes. There are records during winter in Canada of hibernating adult common <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> being ambushed and predated by northern river otters. Other natural predators which have reportedly preyed on adults include coyotes, black bears, alligators and their larger cousins, alligator <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles.</b> Large, old male <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> have very few natural threats due to their formidable size and defenses, and tend to have a very low annual mortality rate.|$|R

Examination of bullfrogs and bass in Montana shows they are consuming few painted <b>turtles.</b> <b>Snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> may have more impact and, in Oregon, aggressive trapping {{has been done to}} remove them.|$|R
25|$|Mammals {{such as the}} white-tailed deer, badger, skunk, beaver, raccoon are {{relatively}} common, while the pronghorn, mule deer and coyote {{are a few of}} the less likely to be observed of the 36 mammal species that have been recorded on the refuge. Lake Ilo NWR is also home to three species of amphibians and six species of reptiles including the tiger salamander, common <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle,</b> bull snake and the chorus frog. Northern pike, yellow perch and black crappie are examples of the 11 fish species that have been documented in the refuge.|$|E
25|$|Tropical Discovery {{was opened}} in 1993. The {{building}} explores several tropical environments and displays mammals, reptiles, fish, amphibians and insects from these areas. The trip {{begins with a}} view into a South American river with different species of freshwater stingray then continues to a cave where guests are immersed within the community of several bat species including the vampire bat. A snake exhibit hidden inside a Mayan temple features several venomous species including the king cobra and eyelash viper. Other South American animals here include capybara, black howler monkey, arapaima, piranha and poison dart frog. Further on, visitors are immersed in a coral reef with epaulette sharks, clownfish, yellow tang, lionfish and garden eels. Around the corner, a gallery of North American snakes is located across from alligator <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> and other North American reptiles and fish in a large pool. Further on, Siamese crocodile lurk in their pool amongst other swamp species like mata mata.

With the imminent threat to April's safety by the Foot, the turtles start to actively {{look for a}} new home. After an argument with Leonardo, Raphael breaks off from the group, while Michelangelo, who soon discovers an abandoned subway station, deems it a perfect hideout. Raphael and Keno defy Splinter's orders and implant Keno into the Foot Clan to find their hideout. However, they are caught and Raphael is captured, while Keno escapes to warn the others. When they come, they are ambushed by Shredder and the Foot; Splinter saves the group, but leaves as they face Tokka and Rahzar, who prove too strong to defeat. Donatello finds Perry and the five of them make a tactical retreat. Once back in their hideout, Perry explains {{that the creation of}} the ooze was an accident, disheartening Donatello, who saw a higher purpose for their existence.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the positive symbology of the rattlesnake, some political use has been for criticism. [...] The <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> (New York) was the central feature of a famous American political cartoon. Published in 1808 in Federalist protest of the Jeffersonian Embargo Act of 1807, the cartoon showed a <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle,</b> jaws locked fiercely {{to the rear of}} an American trader, who was attempting to carry a barrel of goods onto a British ship. The trader was seen whimsically uttering the words [...] "Oh! this cursed Ograbme" [...] (the backwards spelling of [...] "embargo"). [...] Also, during the Great Depression, the gopher tortoise (Georgia, Florida's official tortoise) was known as the [...] "Hoover chicken" [...] (a sarcastic reference to President Herbert Hoover) because it was eaten by poor people out of work.|$|E
500|$|Other TNACI {{projects}} include conservation genetics {{research on}} fish species, including the blue shiner, flame chub, laurel dace, and Conasauga logperch, {{and the development}} of the Freshwater Information Network (FIN), a database of current and historic locality information for 62 southeastern fish species in peril. [...] In April 2016 the Institute, working with the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency and Southeast Missouri State University, began an assessment of the alligator <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> population in Tennessee.|$|E
500|$|Many {{aggressive}} mimics use {{the promise}} of nourishment {{as a way of}} attracting prey. [...] The alligator <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> (Macrochelys temminckii) is a well-camouflaged ambush predator. Its tongue bears a conspicuous pink extension that resembles a worm and can be wriggled around; fish that try to eat the [...] "worm" [...] are themselves eaten by the turtle. Similarly, some snakes employ caudal luring (using the tail) or lingual luring (using the tongue) to entice small vertebrates into striking range.|$|E

In Bavaria, one turtle caused injury of a child, but was not caught. In Bohemia, four turtles of this species have been caught. Both countries have strong laws against keeping alligator <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> without permission. Both are member states of EU, which has laws against invasive species.|$|R
50|$|Common {{habitats}} are shallow ponds or streams. Some may inhabit brackish environments, such as estuaries. Common <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> sometimes bask—though rarely observed—by {{floating on}} the surface with only their carapaces exposed, though in the northern parts of their range, they also readily bask on fallen logs in early spring. In shallow waters, common <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> may lie beneath a muddy bottom with only their heads exposed, stretching their long necks to the surface for an occasional breath (their nostrils are positioned on the very tip of the snout, effectively functioning as snorkels). <b>Snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> consume both plant and animal matter, and are important aquatic scavengers, {{but they are also}} active hunters that prey on anything they can swallow, including many invertebrates, fish, frogs, reptiles (including snakes and smaller turtles), unwary birds, and small mammals. In some areas, adult <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> can be incidentally detrimental to breeding waterfowl, as they will occasionally take ducklings and goslings but their effect on such prey is frequently exaggerated.|$|R
500|$|As of 2010, four U.S. states {{designated}} the painted turtle as official reptile. Vermont honored the reptile in 1994, following {{the suggestion of}} Cornwall Elementary School students. In 1995, Michigan followed, based {{on the recommendation of}} Niles fifth graders, who discovered the state lacked an official reptile. Illinois citizens, in 2004, voted to select the painted turtle as their state reptile and the legislature made it official in 2005. Colorado chose the western painted turtle in 2008, following the efforts of two succeeding years of Jay Biachi's fourth grade classes. [...] In New York, the painted turtle narrowly lost (5,048 to 5,005, versus the common <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle)</b> a 2006 statewide student election for state reptile.|$|E
500|$|Schoolchildren often {{start the}} campaigns for state reptiles. Three {{of the four}} states {{choosing}} the painted turtle credit school classes with initiating the process.

[...] In New York, students statewide voted to pick one of four turtles; the common <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> edged the painted turtle 5,048 to 5,005.

In similar fashion, Newport, Arkansas, publicized its White River Monster, and Algiers, Louisiana, claimed to be home to a flying Devil Man. Ware, Massachusetts, drew media attention to its local reputation for alligator sightings. Perry, New York, held Silver Lake Sea Serpent Festivals based on a local hoax.

500|$|Seemingly broken, {{and again}} {{working on the}} chain gang, Luke stops working to give water to a prisoner. Watched by the {{disappointed}} prisoners, he runs {{to one of the}} trucks to take Boss Godfrey's rifle to him. After Boss Godfrey shoots a <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle,</b> Luke retrieves it from a slough for him, complimenting the boss for his shot. Luke takes one last stab at freedom when he is ordered to take the turtle to the truck. He steals the dump truck, as well as the keys to the other trucks. [...] In the excitement of the moment, Dragline jumps in the dump truck and joins Luke in his escape. Later, after abandoning the truck, Luke tells Dragline that they should part ways. Dragline agrees and leaves. Luke enters a church, where he talks to God and blames Him for sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Moments later, police cars arrive. Dragline walks in and tells Luke that the police and bosses have promised not to hurt Luke if he surrenders peacefully. But Luke, feeling that his life is no longer worth living, walks to a window facing the police and mocks the Captain by repeating the first part of his speech ("What we've got here is a failure to communicate."). He is immediately shot in the neck by Boss Godfrey. Dragline carries Luke outside, then charges at Boss Godfrey and attempts to strangle him until he is beaten and subdued by the other guards. In tears, Dragline implores Luke to live. The local police want to take Luke to a nearby hospital, but the Captain tells them {{to take him to the}} prison hospital instead, a long enough distance that Luke's chances of survival are slim. As the captain's car drives away, it crushes Boss Godfrey's glasses. After Luke's implied death, Dragline and the other prisoners reminisce about him. In the final scene, the prison crew is seen working near a rural intersection close to where Luke was shot. Dragline is now wearing leg irons, and there is a new Walking Boss. As the camera zooms out, the torn photograph of Luke grinning with the two women is superimposed on a bird's eye view of the cross-shaped road junction.|$|E
