During the Cultural Revolution, however, further destruction was prevented when Premier Zhou Enlai sent an army battalion to guard the city.|$|E
5|$|Helmuth Raithel (9 April 190712 September 1990) was a German {{officer who}} held the rank of SS-Standartenführer (colonel) in the Waffen-SS during World War II. While still at school, Raithel was <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the {{excitement}} of the Munich Beer Hall Putsch of 9 November 1923 led by Adolf Hitler, and was subsequently awarded the coveted Blood Order, even though he was {{not a member of the}} Nazi Party. He joined the Reichswehr (interwar German Army) in 1926. After World War II broke out he fought in the invasion of Greece in summer 1941, then against the Soviet Red Army in northern Finland before transferring to the Waffen-SS in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Siege is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game developed by Gas Powered Games {{and published by}} Microsoft Game Studios on April 5, 2002, for Microsoft Windows, and the following year for MacOS. Set in the pseudo-medieval kingdom of Ehb, the high fantasy game follows a young farmer and his companions as they journey to defeat an invading force. Initially only seeking to warn {{the nearby town of}} the invasion of a race of creatures named the Krug, the farmer and the companions that join him along the way are soon <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> finding a way to defeat another race called the Seck, resurgent after being trapped for 300 years. Unlike other role-playing video games of the time, the world of Dungeon Siege does not have levels but is a single, continuous area without loading screens that the player journeys through, fighting hordes of enemies. Also, rather than setting character classes and manually controlling all of the characters in the group, the player controls their overall tactics and weapons and magic usage, which direct their character growth.|$|E

50|$|Eliot Zborowski {{and his son}} Count Louis {{were both}} wealthy racing drivers with Polish family lineage who played key roles in British motorsport's {{earliest}} days. Eliot Zborowski, born in New Jersey, was an accomplished horseman before the growing tide of interest <b>in</b> automobiles <b>swept</b> him <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 1898.|$|R
25|$|Chris Cooper (Kevin McDonald, Jason Barr, younger) is the {{inventor}} of the drug, and main protagonist of the film. He is motivated by the clumsy suicide of his father (also played by McDonald) to create a cure for clinical depression, but quickly gets <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the resulting fame.|$|E
25|$|Gandhi {{had been}} <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{the call for}} Indian {{independence}} since {{she was born in}} 1917.

25|$|In 2014, FAS Lane Racing would {{merge with}} Go Green Racing to form Go Fas Racing, and {{announced}} that Labonte would again return to the No. 32 car for all four superspeedway events. He ran as high as sixth in the Daytona 500 before being <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a late crash and finishing twentieth. Before the race, Labonte called this his final Daytona 500 start.|$|E
50|$|The win made Edvald Boasson Hagen as {{the youth}} classifications winner, {{as well as}} the green jersey for the overall points winner. Edvald Boasson Hagen hit speeds of almost 100 km/h 100 km/h on the fast {{downhill}} section following the second climb and <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> the riders <b>in</b> front of him throughout his ride.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He's there,' Lawford {{reassured}} her, craning {{his neck}} in their slow progress {{to catch a}} peep into the quiet road. And like a flock of birds scared by a chance comer at their feeding in some deserted field, a whirring cloud of memories <b>swept</b> softly <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his mind--memories whose import he {{made no effort to}} discover. None the less, the leisurely descent became in their company something of a real experience even in such a brimming week.|$|R
50|$|The {{return of}} Nebraska IB Jarvis Redwine was short-lived, as {{both he and}} 2nd string IB Craig Johnson left the game with {{injuries}} in the 1st quarter. 3rd string IB Roger Craig was still too much for Colorado as Nebraska <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> the Buffaloes <b>in</b> Boulder while collecting 403 ground yards and a decisive 45-7 win, the 13th Cornhusker win in a row over Colorado, whose only score came in the 4th quarter against Nebraska reserves.|$|R

25|$|In February 1925, a state-commissioned census {{recorded}} 5,625 {{people in}} Fort Lauderdale, and a real-estate boom was in progress in South Florida. While the land rush {{was focused on}} the Miami area, communities throughout the region, including Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach and Boca Raton were <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the speculative buying frenzy. A census undertaken by the city {{during the first week of}} December 1925 counted a population of 15,315, an increase of 300% in less than 10 months.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} the last of a {{collaboration}} between director Curtiz and actor Errol Flynn which began in 1935 and spanned 12 films. The cast also includes Fred MacMurray, on loan from Paramount Studios and Alexis Smith in her first credited screen performance. Flynn portrays a Harvard-educated doctor who is involved in heroic medical research on pilots, with MacMurray as the skeptical veteran aviator who gets <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the project. The plot is not historically accurate but, depicted in a near-documentary style, the film contains elements of true events that were involved in period aeromedical research, as well as real contemporary medical equipment.|$|E
60|$|Faster and faster, over rough road, cattle track, and grassy sward; over {{rising and}} falling ground; now and again {{so close to the}} edge of the high cliff that the spume <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> the gulleys <b>in</b> the rocks like a snowstorm, the white Arab swept round the curve of the bay, and came out on the high {{headland}} where stood the fisher's house. On the very brink of the cliff all the fisher folk, men, women and children, stood looking at the far- off burning ship, from which the flames rose in leaping columns.|$|R
60|$|Roger {{then went}} back to the treasury, closed the copper door, <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> and placed <b>in</b> a rug every {{particle}} of plaster, and then swung the cabinet back into its position, where it fastened with a loud click. So firmly was it fixed that, although Roger tried with his whole strength, it did not shake in the slightest; and the work was so admirably done that, from the closest inspection, he was unable to discern aught that would have shown that the cabinet was not built into the wall. He then returned to where the ladies were waiting him.|$|R
60|$|When I {{first met}} Dumps he was scurrying towards me along a sequestered country lane. It {{was in the}} Dog Days. Dust lay thick on the road; the creature's legs were remarkably short though active, and his hair being long he <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> the dust <b>in</b> clouds as he ran. He was yelping, and I {{observed}} that one or two stones appeared to be racing with, or after, him. The voice of an angry man also seemed to chase him, but {{the owner of the}} voice was at the moment concealed by a turn in the lane, which was bordered by high stone-walls.|$|R
25|$|Robert Southey (1774–1843) was a {{prolific}} author of poetry, essays, histories, biographies, and translations, and Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom from 1813 to 1843. Hazlitt first met Southey in London in 1799. The two, along with Coleridge and Wordsworth, {{whom he had}} met not long before, were <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the movement supporting {{the rights of the}} common man that inspired much of the educated English population {{in the wake of the}} French Revolution. During his brief career as a painter, until about 1803, Hazlitt spent time in the Lake District with Southey and the others, where they debated the future improvement of society as they rambled over the countryside.|$|E
25|$|A huge torchlight march {{took place}} the next night, {{attended}} by an estimated 15,000 Chicagoans. This rally marked {{the eve of}} the escalation of the strike, as on July 23 striking workers on the Michigan Central Railroad marched to the shops of the B & O and the Illinois Central to call out those workers to join the strike for higher wages. Machine shops, factories, and mills were <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the strike wave. Employers and law enforcement authorities launched an offensive of their own, bringing about the firing of Workingmen's Party leader Albert Parsons from his job as a printer, and breaking up a WP meeting attended by 5,000 striking workers, family members and sympathizers through the copious use of nightsticks.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 Fields {{found himself}} <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a brewing {{controversy}} in Omaha. The aforementioned Indian Hills Theater {{was sold to}} Methodist Health Systems, which announced its intention to demolish the theater for a parking lot. A group of Omaha activists formed to save the Indian Hills Theater and Fields was on hand, filming. The preservation fight became a cause célébre, resulting in letters from Hollywood legends pleading for the theater. Such legends included Kirk Douglas, Leonard Maltin, Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, Ray Bradbury and Patricia Neal. Despite these pleas and a recommendation for the theater as a city landmark by the City of Omaha's Landmarks Preservation Commission, Methodist Health Systems began demolition of the theater shortly after the theater had been declared a landmark.|$|E
500|$|The {{subjects}} {{are the more}} gruesome or shameful of Biblical episodes, the only exception seeming {{to be that of}} Elijah being <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> to Heaven <b>in</b> a Chariot of Fire, leaving his mantel to fall on Elisha. However, Elijah's role as a prophet was one marked by accusation and warnings to repent, and the purpose of his translation into Heaven was traditionally seen as so that he might stand before God to condemn Israel for its sins. In four of the five most highly finished [...] "medallions" [...] the space is crowded with figures in violent action, similar to Michelangelo's cartoon for the Battle of Cascina.|$|R
50|$|In 1859, {{three years}} before the {{approval}} of the plan by the Russian government, Russian officials began talks with the Ottomans about the migration of a limited number of emigrants, and in 1860 they two sides negotiated a treaty for the migration of 40,000-50,000 Circassians, with the Ottoman side being eager for an increase in population. At this time, however, numerous Circassians around the Kuban and even Kalmyks had already been expelled to Ottoman lands as the Russians had <b>swept</b> them <b>up</b> <b>in</b> their systematic deportation of Nogais, with British newspapers reporting that Russian forces were forcing a choice of either the Ottoman Empire or Siberia on resident Nogai and Circassian populations, with 18000-20000 Circassians and Nogais ended up packed densely together outside the cities of Istanbul and Üsküdar.|$|R
50|$|Nordhorn's {{landscape}} was shaped {{millions of years}} ago by climate changes, especially the ice ages. The oldest sediments from a depth of about two thousand metres come from the Carboniferous. With the onset of the Cretaceous and Tertiary, the Earth's crust here formed itself into drape folds. In the mid-Tertiary, subtropical temperatures held sway on Nordhorn's plains. Thereafter began the gradual cooling, which reached its high point in the ice ages. After the last ice had melted, lowlands developed. Strong winds <b>swept</b> dunes <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the lifeless surface. Even today, the remains of such dune complexes {{can be found at the}} nearby Tillenberge (mountains). Archaeological finds from the Old Stone Age and the Bronze Age that followed bear witness to human settlement on Nordhorn's sand plains more than 6,000 years ago.|$|R
25|$|Set in France {{during the}} early 19th century, the film {{tells the story of}} Jean Valjean, an ex-convict who, {{inspired}} by a kindly bishop, decides to turn his life around. He eventually becomes mayor of a local town and owner of its factory. He is always alert to the risk of being captured again by police inspector Javert, who is ruthless in hunting down law-breakers, believing they cannot change for the better. One of Valjean's factory workers, Fantine, blames him for her being cast into a life of prostitution. When she dies, he feels responsible and agrees {{to take care of her}} illegitimate daughter Cosette—though he must first escape Javert. Later, when Cosette is grown, they are <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the political turmoil in Paris, which culminates in the Paris Uprising of 1832.|$|E
25|$|Nathaniel Wollf was a 25-year-old from Buffalo, New York, {{just days}} away from graduating, when he volunteered to Dean Greenough that he had {{information}} about the suicide of Cyril Wilcox and was quickly <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Court's investigation. When interviewed he described several homosexual experiences but asserted {{he had made a}} clean break. The Court expelled him and refused his requests for re-admittance though it had initially offered hope that he might return. Wollf's application for admittance to McGill University was also denied because of Harvard's report of the reason for his expulsion. Wollf earned a medical degree at Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York City. After studying psychiatry for three more years, he spent ten years pursuing painting and academic interests. He traveled widely and briefly converted to Islam. He opened a nightclub in Barcelona in 1935. During World War II, he returned to the United States and he served as a psychiatrist for returning soldiers. He then practiced medicine in Mexico. He never married and died in London in 1959.|$|E
25|$|In {{the week}} {{preceding}} the race London experienced {{a series of}} riots; several football matches were called off, but the London–Surrey Cycle Classic was allowed to proceed. On race day British riders Liam Holohan, Kristian House and Tom Murray and Brazil's Cleberson Weber opened up a 6-minute gap in the breakaway before the peloton started to pull them back on the final Box Hill climb. 2009 British road race champion House won the King of the Mountains award. The lead quartet were <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the final 9kilometres as Great Britain and England controlled the pace. Kurt Asle Arvesen then made a bid for the win before being brought back. With 12kilometres to go, Tyler Farrar suffered a puncture. After chasing furiously he reached the peloton with 2kilometres to go, only to see his chance of the win wiped out as a crash occurred; according to Heinrich Haussler it was caused by two riders fighting. The crash split the peloton and {{in a group of}} just 20 riders Mark Cavendish beat Sacha Modolo of Italy and France's Samuel Dumoulin in a sprint finish on the Mall.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 1930, the Soviet secret police, the Cheka, later the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), {{investigated}} teenaged Germans {{suspected of being}} members of the Hitler Youth, but these investigations preceded the Great Purge and those arrested were not given the harsh sentences of later years. Most were released before 1934. As the Great Purge <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> communist activists <b>in</b> massive arrests, their spouses and children were also persecuted. Some were banished to a gulag, some children were put in orphanages and in some cases, older children were themselves {{arrested and charged with}} anti-revolutionary activity and forming anti-revolutionary groups. International communists living in the Soviet Union were hard hit, especially Germans, who were there in large numbers, fleeing Nazism. While German parents were rounded up, accused of espionage, this charge was not plausible for foreign children who had not been outside the Soviet Union in years. Instead, they were charged with having formed a branch of the Hitler Youth.|$|R

25|$|In 2014, RCR ran the 33 in {{the first}} two races of the season with Scott and his family's Whitetail Club. Scott {{finished}} fifth in his Daytona Duel to earn a spot in the Daytona 500, then finished 25th in the race after several accidents. Scott ran the next race at Phoenix, starting and finishing 32nd. Scott was involved in a controversy in the fifth race of the season at Fontana, when he spun out Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Series regular Aric Almirola, who expressed displeasure at Scott's driving and source of sponsorship after getting out of the car. Scott would finish 35th in that race. Brian then won the pole at the spring Talladega race, his first career Cup pole. Scott would not lead any laps, however, and finished 42nd after crashing out. 2000 Cup Champion Bobby Labonte, who was doing test driving for RCR, drove the same car at the summer Daytona race, under the Circle Sport banner. The car again had speed in qualifying, timing in 4th. Labonte would contend for the lead for much of the race but finish 26th after being <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Big One. Richard Childress' younger grandson Ty Dillon drove at Atlanta and Phoenix in the fall, with sponsorship from Rheem, Realtree and Charter Communications.|$|E
25|$|Hubert {{made his}} first Winston Cup race in his first attempt with Jim Wilson's #78 team at Sears Point during the 1997 season. He would bring the #78 Hanes / Diamond Rio Ford home in the 28th position, one lap down. His next start would come in 1998 with the #19 team owned by Kurt Roehrig. He {{qualified}} an impressive 10th in his second race at Sears Point, however the #19 Bradford White Ford would finish 41st after a transmission failure 78 laps into the race. His second start during the 1998 season would come at Watkins Glen with Dan Marino and Bill Elliott's #13 team. Hubert drove the #13 FirstPlus Financial Ford to a 36th-place finish. He would return to Roehrig's team in 1999 for three races. His first start would come at Las Vegas where he qualified fourth, finishing in the 28th position. Again, Hubert raced at Sears Point where he would finish in the 33rd position, one lap down. He also attempted the Pepsi 400 at Michigan, however {{he was unable to}} qualify. In 2000, he would make one start with Penske Racing and the #12 Mobil 1 Ford. He would finish the Global Crossing @ The Glen in 33rd place after starting 16th. In 2001, Hubert qualified Buckshot Jones' #44 Georgia Pacific Dodge for the Dodge/Save Mart 350. In 2002, he would race the Sirius Satellite Radio at the Glen for Bill Davis Racing. Hubert finished the #23 Hills Brothers Coffee Dodge in the 24th position after starting 40th. He would return to the series in 2004 with Kirk Shelmerdine Racing, driving each of the road courses. At the newly renamed Infineon Raceway (formerly Sears Point Raceway) he would finish 43rd in the #72 Freddie B's Ford after running five laps at too slow of a pace for NASCAR. The Watkins Glen would be much better for Hubert as he would finish in the 29th position just one lap down. He would return to Shelmerdine's team for 2005 and attempt each of the road courses. He would make the race at Infineon, however he finished 43rd after oil pressure problems. Hubert would not make the Sirius at The Glen after qualifying was rained out. Hubert again raced for Shelmerdine in 2006 for the Dodge/Save Mart 350, but was <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a crash on the opening lap and once more finished last.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} "Are supernovae important {{sources of}} dust?" is a contentious one. Observations with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) only detected very {{small amounts of}} hot dust in supernova remnants. Here, we review observations of two young Galactic remnants with the Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA), which imply that large quantities of dust are produced by supernovae. The association of dust with the Cassiopeia A remnant is in question due to the contamination of foreground material. In this article, we compare the emission from cold dust with CO emission towards Kepler's supernova remnant. We detect very little CO {{at the location of}} the submillimetre peaks. A comparison of masses from the CO and the dust clouds are made, and we estimate the 3 sigma upper limit on the gas-to-dust ratios to range from 25 - 65 suggesting that we cannot yet rule out freshly-formed or <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> circumstellar dust <b>in</b> Kepler's supernova remnant.

5000|$|A B-scope or b-scan {{provides}} a 2-D [...] "top down" [...] representation of space, with the vertical axis typically representing range and the horizontal axis azimuth (angle). B-scope displays were common in airborne radars in the 1950s and 60s, which were mechanically scanned {{from side to}} side, and sometimes {{up and down as}} well. The B-scope's display represented a horizontal [...] "slice" [...] of the airspace {{on both sides of the}} aircraft out to the tracking angles of the radar. The spot was <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> the Y-axis <b>in</b> a fashion similar to the A-scope's X-axis, with distances [...] "up" [...] the display indicating greater range. This signal was mixed with a varying voltage being generated by a mechanical device that depended on the current horizontal angle of the antenna. The result was essentially an A-scope whose range line was rotated to point up, and then rotated back and forth about a zero point at the bottom of the display. The radio signal was sent into the intensity channel, producing a bright spot on the display indicating returns.|$|R
