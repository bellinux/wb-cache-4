5|$|Zelda {{had a deep}} {{desire to}} develop a talent that was entirely her own, perhaps a {{reaction}} to Scott's fame and success as a writer. At age27, she became obsessed with ballet, which she had studied as a girl. She had been praised for her dancing skills as a child, and although the opinions of their friends vary as to her skill, it appears that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fair degree of talent. But Scott was totally dismissive of his wife's desire to become a professional dancer, considering it a waste of time.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} half of the thirties, Minnie did not appear as often in Mickey cartoons. This was mainly due to the growth in {{popularity}} of Mickey's new sidekicks, Goofy, Donald Duck, and Pluto, whose appearances in Mickey cartoons had more or less replaced Minnie's role. Minnie's appearances in Mickey cartoons thus became less numerous, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> few major roles in some Pluto and Figaro cartoons during the 1940s. Minnie made a sort of comeback in the 1980s when she was re-introduced in Mickey's Christmas Carol and then got her own starring role in Totally Minnie.|$|E

We disagree with the basic premise, Zarf/Zoe as a MTF transgendered lesbian. We want Bianca to be with a woman (and <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> one-night stand with Leslie on New Year’s Eve, which has to be a first for a daytime soap). We don’t want her already messy love life in which she has never been allowed to have a fully realized relationship with another woman (her first lover went crazy and was institutionalized, her next was killed, the next was a corporate thief who then had to return to Poland, the next identical twin of the one who was killed wasn’t sure she was even queer and then left her for another woman). We don’t want her life complicated with the complexities of a transgender relationship.|$|E

The first was at the New School for Social Research in 1933, where her Three Songs for Soprano, Piano, and Percussion were performed. A year later, the second movement from her Suite for Clarinet and Bassoon, performed in one of Henry Cowell's New Music Society of California concerts in San Francisco, was perceived as a [...] "doleful dull duet." [...] Aaron Copland reviewed a New Music Quarterly Recording of the movement. John Cage performed two movements of her [...] "Three Movements for Percussion" [...] in his northwestern percussion tours during the late 1930s. In 1936 her skills in multiple media {{came to the fore}} in her play, The Modern Composer, for which she wrote the lyrics, composed the incidental music, choreographed the modern ballet, designed and created the costumes, slides, and advertisements, directed the production, and performed the piano part. The play was performed {{under the auspices of the}} Federal Music Project at the Central Manhattan Music Center, but manuscript sources for it have not yet been found.
