Methods: A non-random, single-group, multicenter study was conducted. Infants with suspected food protein allergy, persistent feeding intolerance, or presenting conditions where an eHF was deemed appropriate were enrolled in a 15 -day feeding trial. Intake, stool patterns, weight (wt), length, and questionnaires were collected. The primary outcome was maintenance of wt for age Z-score during the study. Results: 25 infants (85 + 8. 9 d of age) were enrolled; 7 were> 4 months; 4 were preterm. At entry, 12 had symptoms of allergic colitis or food protein allergy/intolerance, 12 had persistent formula intolerance, 11 had hematochezia/heme positive stools, and 1 was recovering from necrotizing enterocolitis. Mean wt for age Z-score was- 0. 62 + 0. 19 at entry and- 0. 41 + 0. 16 at exit. Mean change in wt for age Z-score was 0. 21 + 0. 10. Mean formula intake was 764 + 48 mL/day.

40|$|Human milk is {{considered}} to be the optimal source of infant nutrition. Some of the benefits of breastfeeding have been ascribed to human milk oligosaccharides (HMO). For instance, HMO can affect faecal characteristics such as <b>stool</b> <b>consistency</b> and stool frequency. Such effects on stool characteristics can be beneficial for young infants as hard stools and even constipation is common in that age group. Prebiotics in infant milk formulas have been introduced to exert similar functionalities. A specific mixture of prebiotics consists of a combination of short chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scGOS/lcFOS) in a ratio of 9 : 1. This specific mixture has been developed to closely resemble the molecular size composition of HMO. Many studies have been done with scGOS/lcFOS, and indicators for digestive comfort have often been included as secondary outcomes. This review summarizes the effects of scGOS/lcFOS (9 : 1) on <b>stool</b> <b>consistency,</b> stool frequency and transit time in healthy term and preterm infants. In several of the studies with scGOS/lcFOS in a ratio of 9 : 1 in infant milk formulas, positive effects of this mixture on stool characteristics such as <b>stool</b> <b>consistency</b> and stool frequency were observed. As <b>stool</b> <b>consistency</b> was shown to be correlated to whole gut transit time, scGOS/lcFOS can be hypothesised to have a role in reducing the risk of constipation.

Thus, there is an urgent need to conduct clinical trials on existing and novel therapies. PurposeIn order to address these issues the Rome Foundation and members of the Pediatric Committee of the European Medicines Agency formed a subcommittee on clinical trials to develop guidelines for the design of clinical trials in children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The following recommendations are based on evidence from published data when available and expert opinion. Key recommendationsThe subcommittee recommends randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trials to assess the efficacy of new drugs. The combined endpoints for abdominal pain are a decrease in intensity of at least 30 % compared with baseline and to meet or exceed the Reliable Change Index (RCI) for the sample. <b>Stool</b> <b>consistency</b> is measured with the Bristol Stool Scale Form (BSFS). The subcommittee recommends as entry criteria for abdominal pain a weekly average of worst abdominal pain in past 24 h of at least 3. 0 on a 0 - 10 point scale or at least 30 mm in 100 mm Visual Analog Scale. For stool endpoints the committee recommends an average <b>stool</b> <b>consistency</b> lower than 3 in the BSFS during the run-in period for clinical trials on IBS-C and an average <b>stool</b> <b>consistency</b> greater than 5 in the BSFS during the run-in period for clinical trials on IBS-D.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the correlation between}} <b>stool</b> characteristics (<b>consistency</b> and frequency) and gut transit time in children and {{to determine whether the}} Bristol Stool Form Scale is a reliable method of assessing intestinal transit rate in children. STUDY DESIGN: From March 2011 to March 2012, 44 children (25 boys and 19 girls, mean age 7. 8 years) with a diagnosis of functional constipation and 36 healthy, nonconstipated children (17 boys and 19 girls, mean age 7. 6 years) were enrolled. All participants maintained a 1 -week stool diary, recording the time and date of every bowel movement and stool form, and then completed a validated questionnaire on functional constipation according to Rome III criteria. Whole gut transit time (WGTT) was then assessed using the radiopaque markers test. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between stool form and WGTT in both constipated and nonconstipated children (correlation coefficient - 0. 84, P<. 001). By contrast, there was no correlation between either stool frequency and WGTT or stool frequency and stool form. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, using WGTT as a dependent variable, showed that the sole variable significantly associated with WGTT was stool form (regression coefficient 2. 9, OR 18. 4, 95 % CI 5. 4 - 62. 5, P<. 001). CONCLUSION: In this prospective, observational, case-control study, we show that stool form, as measured by the Bristol Stool Form Scale, rather than stool frequency, correlates with WGTT in both constipated and nonconstipated children...|$|R
40|$|Background: Gut flora have {{important}} trophic effects on intestinal epithelia and on immune structure and fonction. They also protect colonized host against invasion by alien microbes. Recent {{research suggests that}} an imbalance of the intestinal microbiota and a dysfunctional intestinal barrier might trigger irritable bowel syndrome (lBS). As probiotics {{have been reported to}} restore the intestinal microbiota and the gut barrier, the therapeutic potential of probiotics within IBS became of strong interest. Objectives:  To assess the efficacy of probiotics in lBS. Methods:  Patients of 15 to 60 years old and both sexes were included f om the out patient department (OPD) of gastroenterology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medi­cal University (BSMMU). A validated lBS-QOL instmment consisted of 34 questions used to assess improvement of quality of Iife before and after treatment. A total of 65 diarrhoea predominant LBS patients were randomised to receive either probiotics(n- 33) or placebo(n- 32) twice daily frir 6 weeks. Results: At the end of 6 weeks therapy, improvement in various symptoms(abclominal pain, <b>stool</b> frequency, <b>consistency</b> and 11 atulence) in probiotics group was statistically significant. Mean QOL score before treatment was 103 in probiotics group and I 06 in placebo group. After 6 weeks of treatment mean QOL score was 82 in probiotics group and I 02. 58 in placebo group. No side effects of the therapeutic agents were observed in any patient during the trial. Conclusions: Probiotics effectively alleviates global IBS and improves TBS symptoms simultaneously with an improvement of quality of life. </p...|$|R
40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) {{is common}} gastrointestinal problems. It {{is characterized by}} abdominal pain or discomfort, and is associated with changes in <b>stool</b> frequency and/or <b>consistency.</b> The etiopathogenesis of IBS may be multifactorial, as is the pathophysiology, which is attributed to alterations in gastrointestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal microbiota, gut epithelium and immune function, dysfunction of the brain-gut axis or certain psychosocial factors. Current therapeutic strategies are often unsatisfactory. There is now increasing evidence linking alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota and IBS. Probiotics are living organisms which, when ingested in certain numbers, exert health benefits beyond inherent basic nutrition. Probiotics have numerous positive effects in the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, many {{studies have suggested that}} probiotics are effective in the treatment of IBS. The mechanisms of probiotics in IBS are very complex. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence and mechanisms for the use of probiotics in the treatment of IBS...|$|R
