25|$|Hageman factor, {{now known}} as factor XII, was {{identified}} in 1955 in an asymptomatic patient with a prolonged bleeding time named of John Hageman. Factor X, or <b>Stuart-Prower</b> <b>factor,</b> followed, in 1956. This protein was identified in a Ms. Audrey Prower of London, who had a lifelong bleeding tendency. In 1957, an American group identified the same factor in a Mr. Rufus Stuart. Factors XI and XIII were identified in 1953 and 1961, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prothrombin}} time (PT)—along with its derived measures of prothrombin ratio (PR) and {{international normalized ratio}} (INR)—are assays evaluating the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. This test is also called [...] "ProTime INR" [...] and [...] "PT/INR". They are {{used to determine the}} clotting tendency of blood, in the measure of warfarin dosage, liver damage, and vitamin K status. PT measures factors I (Fibrinogen), II (Prothrombin), V (Proaccelerin), VII (Proconvertin), and X (<b>Stuart–Prower</b> <b>Factor).</b> [...] It is used in conjunction with the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) which measures the intrinsic pathway and common pathway.|$|E
5000|$|Factor X, {{also known}} by the eponym <b>Stuart-Prower</b> <b>factor,</b> is an enzyme (...) of the {{coagulation}} cascade. It is a serine endopeptidase (protease group S1, PA clan).|$|E
50|$|The {{condition}} was described independently in the 1950s. Telfer and coworkers described a female patient named Prower in 1956 and Hougie and coworker described a male patient named Stuart in 1957. When experiments showed that serum {{from these two}} patients lacked the same factor, these two patients were the first people identified with FX deficiency and the factor was called <b>Stuart-Prower</b> <b>factor,</b> later factor X.|$|E
50|$|Factor Xa is the {{activated}} {{form of the}} {{coagulation factor}} thrombokinase, known eponymously as <b>Stuart-Prower</b> <b>factor.</b> Factor X is an enzyme, a serine endopeptidase, which {{plays a key role}} at several stages of the coagulation system. Factor X is synthesized in the liver. The most commonly used anticoagulants in clinical practice, warfarin and the heparin series of anticoagulants and fondaparinux, act to inhibit the action of Factor Xa in various degrees.|$|E
