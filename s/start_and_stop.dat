5|$|The {{earliest}} model {{proposed for}} the evolution of circular permutations is the permutation by duplication mechanism. In this model, a precursor gene first undergoes a duplication and fusion to form a large tandem repeat. Next, <b>start</b> <b>and</b> <b>stop</b> codons are introduced at corresponding locations in the duplicated gene, removing redundant sections of the protein.|$|E
5|$|The {{transcribed}} pre-mRNA contains untranslated regions at {{both ends}} which contain a ribosome binding site, terminator and <b>start</b> <b>and</b> <b>stop</b> codons. In addition, most eukaryotic open reading frames contain untranslated introns which are removed before the exons are translated. The sequences {{at the ends of}} the introns, dictate the splice sites to generate the final mature mRNA which encodes the protein or RNA product.|$|E
5|$|A 2001 {{report by}} Newell et al. at Southampton University {{undertaken}} for Studio Sound in 2001 {{found that the}} NS-10 had excellent time-domain response at low frequencies – its ability to <b>start</b> <b>and</b> <b>stop</b> in response to signal input {{was found to be}} superior to that of most other nearfield monitors. Part of this was related to its closed-box design. The researchers held that the extremely fast decay time of the speaker in the low frequencies ensures that the bass instruments (guitar and drums) are correctly balanced in the mix.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the problem of}} <b>starting</b> <b>and</b> <b>stopping</b> a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process with fixed costs. In addition, we also study a related optimal switching problem that involves an infinite sequence of <b>starts</b> <b>and</b> <b>stops.</b> We establish {{the conditions under which}} the starting-stopping and switching problems admit the same optimal starting and/or stopping strategies. We rigorously prove that the optimal <b>starting</b> <b>and</b> <b>stopping</b> strategies are of threshold type, and give the analytical expressions for the value functions in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the dependence of timing strategies on model parameters and transaction costs. Comment: To appear in Risk and Decision Analysi...|$|R

5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to <b>start</b> <b>and</b> <b>stop</b> the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E

25|$|One {{prediction}} method uses the intergenic distance between reading frames {{as a primary}} predictor {{of the number of}} operons in the genome.

25|$|The {{signal to}} <b>start</b> <b>and</b> <b>stop</b> trading {{was not always}} a bell. The {{original}} signal was a gavel (which is still in use today along with the bell), but during the late 1800s, the NYSE decided to switch the gavel for a gong to signal the day's beginning and end. After the NYSE changed to its present location at 18 Broad Street in 1903, the gong was switched to the bell format that is currently being used.|$|E

Dom0 hosts the GUI domain and controls the graphics device, as well as input devices, such as the keyboard and mouse.

25|$|Vehicle weight {{influences}} {{the size and}} cost of a system's guideways, which are in turn {{a major part of}} the capital cost of the system. Larger vehicles are more expensive to produce, require larger and more expensive guideways, and use more energy to <b>start</b> <b>and</b> <b>stop.</b> If vehicles are too large, point-to-point routing also becomes more expensive. Against this, smaller vehicles have more surface area per passenger (thus have higher total air resistance which dominates the energy cost of keeping vehicles moving at speed), and larger motors are generally more efficient than smaller ones.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time, Edward Haltom was {{studying}} monorail systems. Haltom {{noticed that the}} time to <b>start</b> <b>and</b> <b>stop</b> a conventional large monorail train, {{like those of the}} Wuppertal Schwebebahn, meant that a single line could only support between 20 and 40 vehicles an hour. In order to get reasonable passenger movements on such a system, the trains had to be large enough to carry hundreds of passengers (see headway for a general discussion). This, in turn, demanded large guideways that could support the weight of these large vehicles, driving up capital costs {{to the point where he}} considered them unattractive.|$|E

The AVOD system, branded KiaOra, features multiple channels of video, audio, music, and games. Passengers can <b>start</b> <b>and</b> <b>stop</b> programs, plus rewind and fast-forward as desired. It is a gate-to-gate in-flight entertainment experience: passengers can start their entertainment {{as soon as they}} board the aircraft, and continue until they arrive at the gate of their destination, maximising play time, which is especially useful for its short-haul Tasman and Pacific Island flights. Gate-to-gate in-flight entertainment is not available on certain seats in economy (such as the bulkhead and emergency exit row seats).|$|E
