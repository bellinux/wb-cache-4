5|$|The castle motte {{was built}} up in several stages, {{originally}} being lower in height than today, before being built up during the medieval period and scarped by cutting away at the surrounding stone. It was then reinforced in 1700 {{with the addition of}} clay, before having large quantities of earth dumped on it in the late 18th century, and then being terraced in the mid-19th century. The motte is separated from the bailey by a ditch, now crossed by a modern bridge. In the 13th century this point was protected by a D-shaped tower, which still survives, located {{to one side of the}} gateway. The causeway <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the mound were originally a roofed, stone corridor. There are the foundations of the castle well on the west side of the causeway.|$|E
5|$|Having missed {{what could}} have been Chelsea's winning penalty, John Terry had to be consoled by his manager, Avram Grant. The Manchester United players formed a guard of honour for Chelsea, lining up in two {{opposite}} rows {{at the foot of the}} <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presentation party and applauding as the Chelsea team – led by chief executive Peter Kenyon – walked through. As Didier Drogba had been sent off during the game, he was not allowed to collect his medal himself and it was given to Grant; when he returned to pitch level, Grant tossed his own medal into the crowd. After Chelsea's team received their medals, Munich air disaster survivor Bobby Charlton, who had captained United to the European Cup title in 1968, led his team up to collect their medals in his capacity as a club director. UEFA President Michel Platini presented both Kenyon and Charlton with commemorative plaques and medals, but Charlton declined to accept his medal; he later donated it to the club museum. When all the players had received their medals, Platini presented Manchester United with the trophy, which Rio Ferdinand – as team captain for the match – and Ryan Giggs – standing in for club captain Gary Neville – lifted together.|$|E

25|$|The {{front of}} the house faces north. There are <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front door which is flanked by a pair of white columns. The {{architectural}} academic, John Gifford, writing of the house in the Fife volume of The Buildings of Scotland, describes the doorcase as being modelled on The Tower of the Winds in Athens. Above the door is a semicircular fanlight; the columns support a heavy entablature.|$|E
25|$|Wooden {{steps with}} {{decorative}} wooden railings of solid wood panels pierced by saw-cut quatrefoils {{climb to the}} hip-roofed porch which runs {{the length of the}} first story on the south (front) facade. Immediately east of them another set of steps leads down to the English basement, currently occupied by a small clothing store. The porch roof is supported by square pillars with knee braces at the top and a molded cornice. At the deck, a baluster similar to those on the <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> porch connects the pillars.|$|E

25|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is on the}} west side of the station (at the top of the diagram, right), facing Courtenay Park and Queen Street which leads into the town centre. The {{main entrance}} is through South Devon House, the building opened in 1927. This involves a couple of <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> platform, but a step-free route leads from the taxi rank on the south side of the building. The car park is beyond this on the site of the former Platform 4. At the north end of this platform are a former terminal platform and sidings alongside Tucker's Maltings which used to serve the Moretonhampstead branch.|$|E
25|$|The rock {{has several}} {{artificial}} cuts in its surface generally {{attributed to the}} Crusaders whose frequent damage to the rock was so severe that the Christian kings of Jerusalem placed a protective marble slab over the rock. The marble slab was removed by Saladin. More recently, there has been speculation that several artificial features of the rock's surface may substantially predate the Crusades. Archaeologist Leen Ritmeyer reports that there are sections of the rock cut completely flat, which north-to-south have a width of 6 cubits, precisely the width that the Mishnah credits {{to the wall of}} the Holy of Holies, and hence Ritmeyer proposed that these flat sections constitute foundation trenches on top of which the walls of the original temple were laid. However, according to Josephus there were 31 <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy of Holies from the lower level of the Temple Mount, and the Mishnah identifies 29 steps in total, and each step was half a cubit in height (according to the Mishnah); this is a height of at least 22 feet—the height of the Sakhra is 21 feet above the lower level of the Temple Mount, and should therefore have been under the floor.|$|E

500|$|Dave Trumbore {{felt the}} Arrow episode tied up the {{introduction}} of Hawkgirl and Hawkman and their nemesis Vandal Savage, and effectively set up the launch of The CW's mid-season, spin-off Legends of Tomorrow. He gave it 4 stars out of 5. He added that the crossover specials [...] "do a fantastic job of pulling back the camera to reveal the wider world that their heroes and villains share". Jonathon Dornbush was impressed with Carlos Valdes' performance, saying: [...] "While Oliver naturally takes center stage — and Stephen Amell <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> task, arguably giving his best performance on the show yet — the secret MVP of the hour is Carlos Valdes' Cisco, {{who also happens to}} steal The Flashs half of the crossover." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{gave the}} single {{three out of}} a {{possible}} five stars. Copsey wasn't convinced with Cruz's vocal work on the song commenting that Kesha takes over the track, [...] "Cruz's vocals soar over the verses, his delicate tones fails to dent that deliciously trashy chorus. Luckily, guest star Kesha more than <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mark [...] it's a bit of a shame that it's not her version of the song". Ken Capobianco from The Boston Globe was negative in his review of the song. Capobianco called the song [...] "salacious", writing that it [...] "features that notorious no-talent, Ke$ha, but with its galloping percussion it makes for salacious nonsense." [...] Ash Dosanjh from NME wrote that Cruz' downfall on his album was when he acted as the [...] "player", citing [...] "Dirty Picture" [...] as an example.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in 2013, praising the natural {{manner in which}} the romance was progressed, saying that this was [...] "refreshing" [...] to see. He felt that the relationship {{did not appear to be}} manipulative for the sake of male viewers, but added that the ending was expected and that the episode never communicated to the audience the need to care about the duo. Handlen wrote that the overall story itself was [...] "shallow", as the episode suffered from an [...] "enervating lack of fun" [...] which was only saved from [...] "complete tedium" [...] through [...] "strong acting and an admirable lack of stigma". Jordon Hoffman, reviewing the episode on his website, commented that Farrell's acting [...] "really <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plate" [...] for this episode, and gave [...] "Rejoined" [...] a rating of five out of five.|$|E

500|$|Perot {{employed}} a massive marketing strategy, spending $34.8 {{million to buy}} half hour and hour segments on major television networks, memorably using charts to illustrate his ideas for the economy. His first infomercial was aired on October 6, and viewed by 16.5 million people. He used two dozen charts and a metal pointer during the ad, explaining that [...] "We got into trickle-down economics and it didn't trickle." [...] He later concluded that [...] "our President blames Congress, Congress blames the President, the Democrats and Republicans blame each other. Nobody <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plate and accepts responsibility for anything." [...] He spent {{a large portion of}} the infomercial speaking into the camera while sitting at a desk in front of a bookshelf. Political experts commented that the nature of the ad was groundbreaking. Two days later, an ad campaign was unveiled that included three new 60-second commercials to air on ESPN, CNN and five other cable networks. One commercial entitled [...] "Red Flag" [...] displayed a waving red flag with a background drum roll and the statement: [...] "While the Cold War is ending another war is upon us. In this new war, the enemy is not the red flag of Communism, but the red ink of our national debt, the red tape of our government bureaucracy. The casualties of this war are counted in lost jobs and lost dreams." [...] A second half hour infomercial was shown on October 9.|$|E
