2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war in March 2003, as many as 775 reporters and photographers were {{traveling}} as embedded journalists. These reporters signed contracts with the military that limited what they were allowed to report on. When asked why the military decided to embed journalists with the troops, Lt. Col. Rick Long of the U.S. Marine Corps replied, [...] "Frankly, our job is to win the war. Part of that is information warfare. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to attempt to dominate the information environment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bly's {{mother died}} from ovarian cancer. Collaborating with her publisher, Avon, an imprint of Harper Collins, {{she became a}} spokesperson, along with six other Avon Romance authors, in a program named K.I.S.S. and TEAL to {{increase}} awareness about the early symptoms of this disease. [...] "Romance is read primarily by women, and ovarian cancer is a women’s disease. Avon and its authors are saying, “You are our readers, our women, and {{we want you to}} live long and healthy lives, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to put the symptoms in the back of every one of these seven books.” We are looking out for our own readers. Almost everyone has been touched by ovarian cancer, whether by the death of a friend or a relative." ...|$|E

500|$|One notable {{feature of}} Contact is {{its use of}} digital color correction. This {{approach}} helped solve continuity errors during the location shooting at the Very Large Array in New Mexico. [...] "The weather killed us, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> back in and changing it enough so that the skies and colors and times of day all seem roughly the same," [...] visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston commented.|$|R
5000|$|About {{when they}} release album, and their habit of not syncing tours with album releases, Barrows has stated, [...] "We got back {{together}} and had new stuff <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do an album. When we have an album's worth of shit, we'll do it. We're on our own schedule. We don't have to put out an album every year whether it sucks or not, ya know. We just.... when we have shit we wanna do, we do it." ...|$|R
5000|$|The long hiatus between {{albums and}} lack of {{substantial}} material began affecting the band's ability to play live, as guitarist/vocalist Jamie Murphy recalls: [...] "When it was 3rd album time, I think we’d been {{away from it all}} for about a year and we had a tour while we had nothing out. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> doing 2000 capacity venues and there’d only be 400 people there. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> onstage every night going, “What the fuck’s going on here? What have we done wrong?”.|$|R
6000|$|... "I’ve got to go, too," [...] {{said the}} captain, {{with what he}} fondly {{imagined}} was a casual smile. [...] "Got to run up and see my boys and girls. Just a flying visit there and back. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O yes; it is good, because {{everybody}} says <b>so.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to take a}} delightful journey. My new-created uncle, as he seems, and I, and my aunt, and perhaps Charlotte, if she is well enough, are going to Nice, and other places about there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} would be so, master," [...] Paolo said thoughtfully; [...] "so I {{think that it would}} be best for me that the king should not take it into his head to give me that estate. And <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to Geneva, master?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>'m</b> <b>going,</b> I ain't afraid; I 'll just hug him, and say I <b>'m</b> ever <b>so</b> glad <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to {{the little}} house," [...] cried Maud, {{scrambling}} off the bed, and running down stairs.|$|R
60|$|But {{the driver}} {{did not know}} where Dutton's tavern <b>was.</b> This <b>we</b> found out after we had started. Some persons might have thought it wiser to settle this matter before starting, but I am not at all sure that it would have <b>been</b> <b>so.</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to this tavern, and did not wish to go {{anywhere}} else. If people {{did not know where}} it was, it would be well for us to go and look for it. We knew the road that it was on, and the locality in which it was to be found.|$|R
6000|$|... "Virginia," [...] he said,--"yes, I mean it--Virginia, don't be unkind to me, {{our last}} night. You {{know very well}} that it hurts me to have you speak and look at me <b>so.</b> Besides, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> friends; you promised me that, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{rejoined the}} boy. [...] "I wished {{to have a}} seat on the banquette, so that I could see; but the seats were all engaged before my father went to the office; <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> in the coupé; but I don't like it half so well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to Saumur! That is an {{enterprise}} worth undertaking. It {{may be considered}} as {{the headquarters of the}} Blues in these parts. There is a considerable body of troops there. If we capture it, we shall give a rare fright to Poitiers, Tours, and the other towns, and cause a scare even in Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Och, I have nigh forgot I {{ever had}} one, save {{when it comes}} to ateing. Tim has to cut my food up for me, and I never sit down to a male without wishing bad cess to the French. When we get back I will have a patent machine for holding a fork fixed on somehow. It goes against me grain to have me food cut up as if I was a baby; if it wasn't for that I should not miss my hand one way or the other. In fact, on the march it has been a comfort that I have only had five fingers to freeze, instead of ten. There is a {{compensation}} in all things. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to fight them at last? There is no chance of the fleet coming to take us off before that, I hope?" [...] he asked, anxiously, [...] "for we should all break our hearts if we were obliged to go without a fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O yes, {{for many}} years. But {{it will not}} <b>be</b> <b>so</b> again. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to have the {{pictures}} cleaned, and the frames mended, and the old pieces of furniture put in their proper places. It will be very nice then. Did you see those in the east closet?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, there, my pet," [...] the {{sergeant}} said soothingly. [...] "You must not cry any more. I {{want you to}} look your best this evening, you know, and to do credit to us all. And now, I think we have settled everything, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> will <b>be</b> <b>going</b> back to tea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Talking of parties, isn't it too {{bad that}} we must give up our Christmas fun? Can't get on without you and Jack, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not <b>going</b> to do a thing, but just have our presents," [...] said Merry, sadly, {{as they began to}} fit {{different}} heads and bodies together, to try droll effects.|$|R
60|$|No; man's complacent {{assumption}} {{of the future is}} too confident. We think, because things have been easy for mankind as a whole for a generation or <b>so,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on to perfect comfort and security in the future. We think that we shall always go to work at ten and leave off at four, and have dinner at seven for ever and ever. But these four suggestions, out of a host of others, must surely do a little against this complacency. Even now, for all we can tell, the coming terror may be crouching for its spring and the fall of humanity be at hand. In the case of every other predominant animal the world has ever seen, I repeat, the hour of its complete ascendency has been the eve of its entire overthrow. But if some poor story-writing man ventures to figure this sober probability in a tale, not a reviewer in London but will tell him his theme is the utterly impossible. And, when the thing happens, one may doubt if even then one will get the recognition one deserves.|$|E
6000|$|He {{would raise}} a lantern silently to light my steps along the narrow, springy plank of our {{primitive}} gangway. [...] "And <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> off," [...] he would murmur directly my foot touched the deck. I was the harbinger of sudden departures, {{but there was}} nothing in the world sudden enough to take Dominic unawares. His thick black moustaches, curled every morning with hot tongs by the barber at the corner of the quay, seemed to hide a perpetual smile. But nobody, I believe, had ever seen the true shape of his lips. From the slow, imperturbable gravity of that broad-chested man you would think he had never smiled in his life. In his eyes lurked a look of perfectly remorseless irony, as though he had been provided with an extremely experienced soul; and the slightest distension of his nostrils would give to his bronzed face a look of extraordinary boldness. This was the only play of feature of which he seemed capable, being a Southerner of a concentrated, deliberate type. His ebony hair curled slightly on the temples. He may have been forty years old, and he was a great voyager on the inland sea.|$|E
6000|$|The {{great man}} smiled. 'Thou art not {{altogether}} right, Macumazahn,' he said; 'I have plotted in my time, {{but it was}} not ambition that led me to my fall; but, shame on me that I should have to say it, a fair woman's face. Let it pass. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to see something like the old times again, Macumazahn, when we fought and hunted in Zululand? Ay, I will come. Come life, come death, what care I, so that the blows fall fast and the blood runs red? I grow old, I grow old, and I have not fought enough! And yet am I a warrior among warriors; see my scars' -- and he pointed to countless cicatrices, stabs and cuts, that marked the skin of his chest and legs and arms. 'See the hole in my head; the brains gushed out therefrom, yet did I slay him who smote, and live. Knowest thou how many men I have slain, in fair hand-to-hand combat, Macumazahn? See, here is the tale of them' -- and he pointed to long rows of notches cut in the rhinoceros-horn handle of his axe. 'Number them, Macumazahn -- one hundred and three -- and I have never counted but those whom I have ripped open {Endnote 3}, nor have I reckoned those whom another man had struck.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to eat," [...] he insisted. [...] "I am faint, and <b>so</b> <b>are</b> you. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to {{that same}} place, and we'll have lunch and dinner in one." ...|$|R
5000|$|The guitar {{that appears}} on the album cover {{at the bottom of}} the pool is {{actually}} a guitar that Foreman bought at a pawn shop in North Dakota. The original intention was [...] "to light it on fire, but the place wouldn't let us light things on fire, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to break it in half." [...] But after playing it a few times, Foreman became too attached to it, thus leaving it intact {{at the bottom of the}} pool. The photo used on the cover was taken at a [...] "sketchy hotel" [...] in North Los Angeles. Several variations of the cover exist. The original 2003 pressings of the record featured black lettering on the artwork, while the 2004 re-issues featured larger white letters and/or a sticker with the title font superimposed onto an image of a drum set.|$|R
60|$|We {{are going}} to try almost immediately, for there is no time to be lost. 'The sands,' to quote Mr. Chamberlain on another subject, 'are running down in the glass.' Ladysmith has stood two months' siege and bombardment. Food and {{ammunition}} stores are dwindling. Disease is daily increasing. The strain on the garrison has been, in spite of their pluck and stamina, a severe one. How long can they hold out? It is difficult to say precisely, because after the ordinary rations are exhausted determined men will eat horses and rats and beetles, and such like odds and ends, and so continue the defence. But another month must be the limit of their endurance, and then if no help comes Sir George White will have to fire off all his ammunition, blow up his heavy guns, burn waggons and equipment, and sally out with his whole force in a fierce endeavour to escape southwards. Perhaps half the garrison might succeed in reaching our lines, but the rest, less the killed and wounded, would be sent to occupy the new camp at Waterfall, which has been already laid out--such is the intelligent anticipation of the enemy--for their accommodation. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to try to force the Tugela within the week, and I dare say my next letter will give you some account of our fortunes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Five o'clock.--Mrs. Delaval is come, {{and there}} is no room nor need for us, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> home. It is best, for mamma was nursing him all night, and is tired out. He has {{improved}} much {{in the course of the}} day, and they hope that he may soon be moved home. The pitmen want to carry him back on his mattress on their shoulders. He has made himself king of their hearts! He has been able to inquire after them, and Lady Lucy, who forgets no one, has been down-stairs to see the old Betty. [...] "Ah! my pretty lady," [...] she said, [...] "you are not sorry now that you tried to take the Lord's Cross patiently, and now, you see, your sorrow is turned into joy." [...] And then Lady Lucy would not have it called patience, and said she had had no submission in her, and Betty answered her, [...] "Ah! well, you are young yet, and He fits the burden to the shoulder." [...] How an adventure like this brings out the truth of every character, as one never would have known it otherwise. Who would have dreamt of that pattern of saintly resignation in the Coalworth heath, or that Lady Lucy Delaval would have found a poor old woman her truest and best comforter? and this without the least forwardness on the old woman's part.|$|E
60|$|My dearest Miss Mitford,--I {{am quite}} in pain {{to have to}} write a {{farewell}} to you after all. As soon as Wilson had returned--and she stayed away much longer than last year--we found ourselves pushed {{to the edge of}} our time for remaining in England, and the accumulation of business to be done before we could go pressed on us. I am almost mad with the amount of things to be done, as it is; but I should have put the visit to you at the head of them, and swept all the rest on one side for a day, if it hadn't been for the detestable weather, and my horrible cough which combines with it. When Wilson came back she found me coughing in my old way, and it has been without intermission up to now, or rather waxing worse and worse. To have gone down to you and inflicted the noise of it on you would have simply made you nervous, while the risk to myself would have been very great indeed. Still, I have waited and waited, feeling it scarcely possible to write to you to say, 'I am not coming this year.' Ah, I am so very sorry and disappointed! I hoped against hope for a break in the weather, and an improvement in myself; now we must go, and there is no hope. For about a fortnight I have been a prisoner in the house. This climate won't let me live, there's the truth. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on Monday. We go to Paris for a week or two, and then to Florence, and then to Rome, and then to Naples; but we shall be back next year, if God pleases, and then I shall seize an early summer day to run down straight to you and find you stronger, if God blesses me so far. Think of me and love me a little meanwhile. I shall do it by you. And do, do--since there is no time to hear from you in London--send a fragment of a note to Arabel for me, that I may have it in Paris before we set out on our long Italian journey. Let me have the comfort of knowing exactly how you are before we set out. As for me, I expect to be better on crossing the Channel. How people manage to live and enjoy life in this fog and cold is inexplicable to me. I understand the system of the American rapping spirits considerably better....|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{this fellow}} {{tell us the}} truth, Griffin?" [...] asked Cuffe, a good deal mystified by Raoul's {{artifice}} and his assumed simplicity. [...] "If <b>so,</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>going</b> exactly on the wrong scent by hauling round Campanella and running into the Gulf of Salerno. The French hold Gaeta yet, and it is quite likely that Master Yvard may wish to keep a friendly port open under his lee!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{take our}} own bearings," [...] Hawtry said. [...] "The sun now is nearly on our left. Well, of course, that is somewhere about west-sou-west, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> must <b>be</b> <b>going</b> northward. I don't think {{that can be}} right. I'm sure it can't. Look here, you fellow, there is the sun setting there"--and he pointed to it--"Gibraltar must lie somewhere over there, and that's the way we mean to go." ...|$|R
