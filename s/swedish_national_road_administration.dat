40|$|The {{vision for}} the road safety work in Norway is to strive for zero {{fatalities}} and zero serious injuries. The policy {{is referred to as}} “the zero vision. ” The <b>Swedish</b> <b>National</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration</b> first introduced this in 1997. It was adapted to Norway by the Public <b>Roads</b> <b>Administration</b> (the PRA) 1 in 1999 and passed by Parliament as part of the National Transport Plan in February 2001. Even if the zero vision was not passed before 2001, I count 1999 as the year when it began to make its mark on the Norwegian road safety work. The zero vision focuses on the ethical necessity of preventing fatalities and serious injuries in road traffic. It maintains a scientific approach to road safety, seeing the road users, the vehicle and the infrastructure in relation to each other. A third tenet of the zero vision is that the system designers and the road users have a shared responsibility for road safety. The thesis studies the impact of the zero vision on road safety in Norway during the period 1999 - 2004. Impact does not primarily refer to factual changes, but to how informants from the key road safety organisations see changes after the introduction of the zero vision...|$|R

The flared guardrail terminal was modeled and two vehicle models were modified with LS-DYNA to simulate an oblique impact situation. The goal of the simulations was to improve the vehicle models by refining their wheels and steering-suspension systems for better prediction and reproduction of the vehicle behavior during oblique collisions with guardrails. The refined front wheels and steering-suspension systems affected the impact behavior of the vehicles due to wheel-post impacts. A vehicle model needs these refined systems to improve oblique impact analysis with guardrails...|$|E

In the study 86 persons, half of these earlier trained in EcoDriving, drove on a route in real traffic with two instrumented cars. Driving patterns and fuel consumption were measured on road. Emissions were measured on dynamometer for complete cycles. The results show no significant differences in emissions between trained and untrained drivers except for CO 2. Drivers trained in EcoDriving who in the enquiry stated that they regularly check their fuel consumption and therefore have a motivation for driving economically had lower fuel consumption compared to other trained and untrained drivers. This result shows that both training and motivation is needed to achieve low fuel consumption. Keys-words: ecodriving, ecodrive, driving style, emissions, fuel consumptio...|$|E
40|$|During {{the winter}} 1993 / 94, the <b>Swedish</b> <b>National</b> <b>Road</b> <b>Administration</b> {{received}} considerable criticism for its winter maintenance {{and in particular}} for the high consumption if road salt. This led to discussions on changing the rules for winter maintenance. Some ice or snow was temporary allowed on the roads with high winter maintenance standard. More roads were degraded to lower winter maintenance standard where ice or snow were permanently permitted. In addition, certain changes intended to influence driver behaviour and vehicle equipment for example mandating the use of winter tyres were to be studied. The purpose of the first investigation described in this paper was to calculate the socio-economic consequences that may be expected from a requirement on winter tyres in various circumstances. In the second investigation in this paper the traffic safety effect of the requirement is studied. A requirement of using winter tyres when it is slippery was selected based on facts from the first investigation...|$|E

The goal is to inform the driver about the maximal friction force which can be utilized and alarm him for sudden changes.

The physical relation between these parameters and the maximal friction force is determined from extensive test trials.
