40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from a combined experimental and advanced computational study to understand the dynamic response of a pultruded fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> 9 m length that is installed into the ground near Venice, Italy. The peak embedment force of 10 kN is applied at the top as a sinusoidal compression force having a maximum frequency of circa 760 Hz. Physical measurements from accelerometers are reported for the lateral deformation response <b>of</b> a single <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> and <b>of</b> a unit restrained by an installed waterfront barrier. A finite-element modeling methodology for the two test configurations is developed by using the Strand 7 code, so that advanced computational results can be compared against the field application measurements. Closed-form equations for the fundamental frequency are developed, with one accounting {{for the presence of}} rotary inertia and shear deformation. Dynamic responses at different embedment lengths (1 - 7 m) are examined, and a very good correlation is found between theory and practice. Numerically, the performance <b>of</b> the FRP <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> is compared with the response <b>of</b> a fictitious <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> and with two new FRP geometries that increase stiffness to minimize flexure about the minor axis of bending. By increasing the mass by 10 %, the maximum lateral displacement can be the same as the steel unit and 1 / 20 of the tested FRP unit. Findings of the research demonstrate that the FRP unit can be installed by using the same pile driving rig and procedure for steel <b>sheet</b> <b>piling...</b>|$|R

40|$|Urban {{construction}} sites require strict {{control of their}} environmental impact, which, for vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> driving, can include damage to nearby structures due to ground vibrations. However, the lack of knowledge concerning the generation of soil vibrations makes the prediction of ground vibration levels difficult. This MSc. thesis in particular, focuses on a crucial link in the vibration transfer chain: the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil interface, which {{is also one of}} the least documented. The aim of this thesis is first, to carry out a full-scale field test consisting in the monitoring <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> and ground vibrations during <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibratory driving. And second, to analyze a selected portion of the collected data with focus on the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer. Both aspects of the thesis work aim, more generally, to contribute to the understanding of ground vibration generation under vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> driving. The full-scale field study was performed in Solna in May 2013. It consisted in the vibratory driving <b>of</b> seven <b>sheet</b> <b>piles,</b> out <b>of</b> which three were fitted with accelerometers. During the driving, ground vibrations were measured by accelerometers, the closest ones placed only 0. 5 m from the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> line. The design and installation of the soil instrumentation was innovative in as much as accelerometers were not only set on the ground surface but also at three different depths (~ 3 m, 5 m and 6 m). The analysis presented in this thesis is primarily a comparison between <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibrations and ground vibrations measured 0. 5 m from the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> line. The principal aspects considered in the comparison are: the influence of penetration through different soil layers, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer efficiency, the frequency content <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> and soil vibrations, and differences between toe- and shaft-generated vibrations. The main conclusions from this study are:  Most of the vibration loss occurs in the near field: 90 - 99 % <b>of</b> the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibration magnitude was dispersed within 0. 5 m from the driven <b>sheet</b> <b>pile.</b> Moreover, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer efficiency was reduced for higher <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> acceleration levels and higher frequencies.  The soil characteristics strongly influence the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibration levels. A clear distinction could be made between "smooth" and "hard" driving, the latter being associated with an impact situation at the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> toe.  The focus of ground vibration studies should not only be the vertical vibrations.

Among the main factors which influence this are the soil friction in the interlocks and the transmission of longitudinal shear forces in the interlocks <b>of</b> the <b>sheet</b> <b>piles.</b> In the field, the soil–interlock interaction depends mainly on the installation method and the soil properties. The aim of this research was to study the dependencies between the applied forces and the friction in the interlocks by full-scale physical modeling during press-in by taking the pile–pile and interlock–soil interactions into account.

40|$|In {{geotechnical}} practice frequently use is made <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls for soil and/or {{water retaining}} constructions. High demands {{are made with}} respect to the deformations, in particular in urban surroundings. Often these walls are composed of V- or Z-shaped profiles, whereby both profiles have their specific advantages and disadvantages. A common used variant is a <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall composed <b>of</b> so called double If-profiles. A double If-profile is made up of two single U-profiles which are connected by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double If-profile is the rotation of the neutral axis. As a result <b>of</b> that, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall tends to deflect both in forward (lateral) direction as well as in sideway (transverse) direction. This phenomenon is called oblique bending, and it results in a loss of stiffness and strength (compared to a continuous wall) and thus larger deformations. Oblique bending goes together with slip in the free interlocks and a transverse deflection <b>of</b> the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall relative to the soil body. Oblique bending might be influenced by the transverse bearing capacity of the soil, i. e. the soil reduces or even prevents the transverse deformation <b>of</b> the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile.</b> Besides, the shear stress in the free interlock possibly reduces oblique bending. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine the transverse bearing capacity of the soil. Therefore a three dimensional finite element model is made <b>of</b> a cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a dry excavation in front and without friction in the sliding interlocks.
