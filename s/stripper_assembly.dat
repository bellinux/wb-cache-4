40|$|A {{two-stage}} {{tandem accelerator}} sys-tem, {{powered by a}} Dynamitron high voltage generator, is currently undergoing fac-tory tests. The parallel-coupled, cas-caded-rectifier generator has been de-signed for a 5 mA current capability at maximum guaranteed voltage for future high current operation. A large diameter gas stripping canal is used in two-stage operation to optimize beam transmission. Titanium getter-ion pumps are mounted in the terminal {{at the ends of}} the <b>stripper</b> <b>assembly</b> to insure acceptable vacuum con-ditions in the fully shielded acceleration tubes. Guaranteed specifications of this model series are 150 VA of targeted proton current at 10 MeV. The injector has de-livered up to 250) 1 A of H- and the gener-ator has operated at 5. 7 MV during initial testing. The complete system is now being assembled for beam test. Some novel fea-tures of this new tandem are described and operational performance characteris-tics measured during factory testing are reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} gas <b>stripper</b> <b>assembly</b> in a tandem {{terminal}} of AMS facility is a compromise giving consideration to the conflicting requirements of stripper gas thickness, beam transmission and vacuum conditions inside acceleration tubes. A new stripper arrangement is being under developed for PKUAMS. The foil stripper {{will be moved}} to the position behind the gas stripper, a wider canal {{will be used as}} the stripper channel and an AST 100 hybrid pump will be installed in the terminal to recirculate the stripper gas. Calculation has been carried out for the design and showed good results. The gas pressure in center of stripper tube could be enhanced by a factor of 2, and the vacuum conditions in both the LE and HE acceleration tubes could be improved 2 and 1. 5 orders, respectively. The beam acceptance of the stripper could be enlarged due to using a wider channel. ...|$|E
40|$|The 14 UD {{has evolved}} {{over the past two}} years from {{acceptance}} tests to an extremely reliable and convenient research tool well suited to heavy-ion physics research. The development of the open corona point distribution system with the reintroduction of tie wires eliminated problems with gradient control and point lifetime. Easy inspection of the open points is a valuable diagnostic aid when beam transport problems occur. Electromechanical remote actuators for functions in the terminal have been replaced with pneumatic ones driven by SF 6 at 50 psi above tank pressure. Foils are changed, sublimer pellet heaters switched and a high energy tube entrance aperture selected by these devices. Long experience running from 6 to 13 MV has convinced us that enclosed corona points would not make our operation any more convenient. The machine is quite stable with negligible tube and column corona currents. Because of this, the machine typically runs with only one chain at a time. Since installation of SF 6 powered oilers for the chains, there have been no further problems of instability or breakage. An integral valve for the NEC <b>stripper</b> foil <b>assembly</b> has been installed to maintain the conditioned status of the tube during stripper foil changes. All main power wiring has been replaced with mineral insulated cable sheathed in copper. No degradation in insulation has been found...|$|R
