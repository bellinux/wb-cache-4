5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as <b>severe</b> <b>combined</b> <b>immunodeficiency,</b> acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E
25|$|Transgene use {{in humans}} is {{currently}} fraught with issues. Transformation of genes into human cells {{has not been}} perfected yet. The most famous example of this involved certain patients developing T-cell leukemia after being treated for X-linked <b>severe</b> <b>combined</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> (X-SCID). This was attributed to the close proximity of the inserted gene to the LMO2 promoter, which controls the transcription of the LMO2 proto-oncogene.|$|E
25|$|Insertional {{mutagenesis}} – If the DNA {{is integrated}} in a sensitive {{spot in the}} genome, for example in a tumor suppressor gene, the therapy could induce a tumor. This has occurred in clinical trials for X-linked <b>severe</b> <b>combined</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> (X-SCID) patients, in which hematopoietic stem cells were transduced with a corrective transgene using a retrovirus, and {{this led to the}} development of T cell leukemia in 3 of 20 patients. One possible solution is to add a functional tumor suppressor gene to the DNA to be integrated. This may be problematic since the longer the DNA is, the harder it is to integrate into cell genomes. CRISPR technology allows researchers to make much more precise genome changes at exact locations.|$|E

In the late 1990 s, our groups in Paris, London and Milan began treating children suffering from rare immune disorders (<b>severe</b> <b>combined</b> <b>immunodeficiencies,</b> or SCIDs). The successful treatment of the first patients was greeted with excitement when it was first reported in 2000 and 2002.

40|$|<b>Severe</b> <b>combined</b> <b>immunodeficiencies</b> (SCID) are {{commonly}} fatal early in life. Adequate diagnosis and rapid institution of treatment, such as allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), is essential. Several studies demonstrated that reconstitution of B-cell function after SCT is better in B-positive SCID than in B-negative SCID. We demonstrate that B-cell reconstitution in a B-negative SCID patient {{due to an}} Artemis mutation required {{the elimination of the}} autologous precursor-B-cells in bone marrow, probably to create physical space in the precursor-B-cell niches.

25|$|Transposon {{silencing}} {{is a form}} of transcriptional {{gene silencing}} targeting transposons. Transcriptional gene silencing is a product of histone modifications that prevent the transcription of a particular area of DNA. Transcriptional silencing of transposons is crucial to the maintenance of a genome. The “jumping” of transposons generates genomic instability and can cause extremely deleterious mutations. Transposable element insertions have been linked to many diseases including hemophilia, <b>severe</b> <b>combined</b> <b>immunodeficiency,</b> and predisposition to cancer. The silencing of transposons is therefore extremely critical in the germline in order to stop transposon mutations from developing and being passed on to the next generation. Additionally, these epigenetic defenses against transposons can be heritable. Studies in Drosophila, Arabidopsis thaliana, and mice all indicate that small interfering RNAs are responsible for transposon silencing. In animals, these siRNAS and piRNAs are most active in the gonads.|$|E
25|$|The first {{attempts}} at gene therapy involving viral vectors {{began in the}} early 1980s, when retroviruses were developed that could insert a foreign gene into the host's genome. They contained the foreign gene but did not contain the viral genome and therefore could not reproduce. Tests in mice were followed by tests in humans, beginning in 1989. The first human studies attempted to correct the genetic disease <b>severe</b> <b>combined</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> (SCID), but clinical success was limited. In the period from 1990 to 1995, gene therapy was tried on several other diseases and with different viral vectors, but {{it became clear that the}} initially high expectations were overstated. In 1999 a further setback occurred when 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger died in a gene therapy trial. He suffered a severe immune response after having received an adenovirus vector. Success in the gene therapy of two cases of X-linked SCID was reported in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Finding a {{cure for}} the {{diseases}} caused by frameshift mutations is rare. Research into this is evident. One example is a primary immunodeficiency (PID), an inherited condition {{which can lead to}} an increase in infections. There are 120 genes and 150 mutations that play a role in primary immunodeficiencies. The standard treatment is currently gene therapy, but this is a highly risky treatment and can often lead to other diseases, such as leukemia. Gene therapy procedures include modifying the zinc fringer nuclease fustion protein, cleaving both ends of the mutation, which in turn removes it from the sequence. Antisense-oligonucleotide mediated exon skipping is another possibility for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This process allows for passing over the mutation so {{that the rest of the}} sequence remains in frame and the function of the protein stays intact. This, however, does not cure the disease, just treats symptoms, and is only practical in structural proteins or other repetitive genes. A third form of repair is revertant mosaicism, which is naturally occurring by creating a reverse mutation or a mutation at a second site that corrects the reading frame. This reversion may happen by intragenic recombination, mitotic gene conversion, second site DNA slipping or site-specific reversion. This is possible in several diseases, such as X-linked <b>severe</b> <b>combined</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> (SCID), Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome, and Bloom syndrome. There are no drugs or other pharmacogenomic methods that help with PIDs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAIDS and {{the bare}} {{lymphocyte}} syndrome (BLS) are <b>severe</b> <b>combined</b> <b>immunodeficiencies.</b> BLS results from mutations in genes that regulate {{the expression of}} class II major histocompatibility (MHC II) determinants.

By binding to the same surface in the cyclin T 1, which together with CDK 9 forms the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, Tat inhibits CIITA. CIITA can also activate transcription when tethered artificially to RNA. Moreover, a dominant-negative CDK 9 protein inhibits the activity of MHC II promoters. Thus, CIITA is a novel cellular coactivator that binds to P-TEFb for the expression of its target genes...|$|R
