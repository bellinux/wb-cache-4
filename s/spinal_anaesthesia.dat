40|$|BACKGROUND: Metabolic and {{hormonal}} {{changes are}} noticed {{within the first}} few hours after surgical injury. These changes {{are influenced by the}} intensity, duration, type of injury, and the anaesthetic techniques. AIM: To investigate the effects of anaesthesia on cortisol, insulin and glucose concentrations during major gynaecological surgeries. METHODS: Forty patients were randomly allotted to receive either balanced general anaesthesia (n= 20) or combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anaesthesia</b> extending from T 5 to S 5 (n= 20). Blood samples were collected for cortisol and glucose at preinduction, 1, 3 and 4 hours, and for insulin at preinduction and 24 hours after incision. RESULTS: The mean cortisol concentration was significantly lower 4 hours after incision with combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anaesthesia</b> (19. 96 ± 11. 32) μg/dl than with balanced general anaesthesia (38. 94 ± 10. 6) μg/dl, p = 0. 018. The mean insulin concentration, 24 hours after incision decreased with combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anaesthesia,</b> but increased with balanced general anaesthesia p = 0. 403. The mean glucose concentrations were significantly lower with combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anaesthesia</b> than with balanced general anaesthesia during the 4 hour study period p ≤ 0. 05. CONCLUSION: combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anaesthesia</b> extending from T 5 to S 5 resulted in lower cortisol, insulin and glucose concentrations during major gynaecological surgeries.

25|$|Both {{general and}} {{regional}} anaesthesia (spinal, epidural or combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia) are acceptable for use during Caesarean section. Evidence {{does not show}} a difference between regional anaesthesia and general anaesthesia with respect to major outcomes in the mother or baby. Regional anaesthesia may be preferred as it allows the mother to be awake and interact immediately with her baby. Other advantages of regional anesthesia may include the absence of typical risks of general anesthesia: pulmonary aspiration (which has a relatively high incidence in patients undergoing anesthesia in late pregnancy) of gastric contents and esophageal intubation. However, one trial found no difference in satisfaction when general anaesthesia was compared with either <b>spinal</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b>|$|E

40|$|Gabapentin, a {{structural}} analogue of gamma-amino butyric acid, {{has been used}} as an anticonvulsant and antinociceptive drug but its mode of action is not well understood. Gabapentin has been demonstrated in various clinical studies to be of value as preemptive analgesic, and has shown to reduce the postoperative requirement of opioids. This study was conducted to evaluate the role of gabapentin as preemptive analgesic in patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy. Fifty patients with ASA grade I and II were assigned to receive 300 mg gabapentin or placebo 2 hr before surgery. Surgeries were conducted under combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anaesthesia.</b> Post operatively, pain was assessed by visual analogue score (VAS) at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hrs. Patients were given epidural boluses of bupivacaine (0. 125 %) on demand. Total numbers of epidural boluses during first 24 hrs postoperatively were noted. Patients in gabapentin group have significantly lower VAS score 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hrs postoperatively as compared to the placebo (1. 3 ± 1. 3, 2. 3 ± 1. 4, 3. 2 ± 2. 1, 1. 8 ± 1. 7, 1. 2 ± 1. 3 vs. 2. 1 ± 1. 7, 3. 2 ± 1. 6, 4. 4 ± 1. 2, 3. 3 ± 1. 1, 2. 1 ± 1. 2 respectively; P < 0. 05). Total numbers of epidural boluses were significantly less in gabapentin group (3. 4 ± 1. 6 vs. 5. 6 ± 2. 1, P< 0. 05). We conclude that preemptive use of gabapentin 300 mg orally significantly reduces the number of postoperative epidural bolus requirement and postoperative pain in patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy under combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anaesthesia...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Many {{patients}} {{who suffer from}} hip fractures have multiple medical comorbidities and there are risks when undergoing <b>spinal</b> or general <b>anaesthesia.</b> In fact, screw fixation can be performed under local anaesthesia infiltration for undisplaced femoral neck fracture, thus enabling patients for early mobilisation and rehabilitation. Methods: Ten patients had screw fixation performed under local anaesthesia. Parameters including pain tolerability, operation time, time to mobilisation after operation, hospital stay, and surgical outcomes were measured. Results: All 10 patients were able to complete the operation under local anaesthesia with minimal pain during the intraoperative period. No extra sedation, any form of intraoperative analgesia, or conversion to other form of anaesthesia was needed. No local wound or implant-related complication was detected in the early postoperative period. An average of 23. 1 months (range: 17 – 28 months) follow-up showed all fractures had healed without any implant-related complications or avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Conclusion: Screw fixation can be performed safely under local anaesthesia in selected {{patients who}} have high-risk of <b>spinal</b> or general <b>anaesthesia</b> in order to accelerate their rehabilitation...|$|R
