A {{conceptual}} study of performance enhancing devices for an airfoil {{is performed using}} Computational Fluid Dynamics. Three simple, passive devices are examined to explore alternate methods for stall control and lift-to-drag improvement. The motivation behind this research is to study effective techniques to improve performance with fewer drawbacks than previously existing methods. An evaluation scheme is presented to compute airfoil lift, drag and pitching moment {{for a range of}} angles-of-attack up to stall. NACA 641 - 212 single-element and slatted airfoil CFD results are compared with experimental data to validate the computational model. Evaluations on the first conceptual design (<b>Stall</b> <b>vane)</b> show elimination of the separation at 15 degrees of angle-of-attack where the flow reversal normally starts at 86 % - chord. A total drag increase of 22 % is detected because of the sharp leading-edge of the device, but the main element drag has a reduction of 43 %. The maximum lift coefficient does not show a significant change on the same model. The second device (Cylinder) has a negative effect, initiating flow separation and causing a significant decrease in lift-to-drag ratio at a given lift coefficient. The third device (Dimples) demonstrates the potential of lift-to-drag ratio improvement at the higher angle-of-attack. Further investigation is required to verify the results since the improvement is small...|$|E
40|$|Wind-tunnel {{tests of}} the McDonnell XP- 85 {{airplane}} were conducted to determine its longitudinal, lateral, and directional stability and {{the characteristics of the}} aileron, the ruddervator, the leading-edge droop nose flap, and the <b>stall</b> control <b>vanes.</b> The directional stability of the airplane with numerous skyhook modifications and with a ventral fin was also investigated. The results of the tests showed that the effectiveness of the droop nose flaps and the <b>stall</b> control <b>vanes</b> was negligible with regard to either the maximum lift or longitudinal stability of the airplane. Contrary to any previous small-scale results, extension of the skyhook caused a 75 -percent reduction in the directional stability of the airplane for both low and high values of lift coefficient. The simplest solution to the problem short of a major redesign of the skyhook appears to be the adoption of a ventral fin...|$|R
50|$|The Caravelle 10A and 10B, which {{differed}} only in {{the engines}} used and were {{commonly referred to as}} the Super Caravelle, featured the improvements of the VI.R in addition to a high degree of further design changes. The more high-profile modifications including a stretch of the fuselage by 33-inches, a highly altered wing, an aerodynamic fairing behind the fin of the tailplane, expanded cargo capacity via raised floor support struts, and higher cabin windows; other changes including the adoption of variable-displacement pumps for the hydraulic system and the use of AC-based generators in place of earlier DC counterparts along with an auxiliary power unit (APU). The redesigned wing was equipped with double-slotted Fowler flaps, additional and repositioned <b>stall</b> <b>vanes,</b> aerodynamic improvements to the wing root and adjustments to the leading edge which improved the performance of the wing during the crucial takeoff and landing phases of flight. However, despite its commercial success, the Caravelle was soon displaced from being the focus of Sud Aviation's development efforts while the majority of the company's design engineers were progressively reallocated onto an entirely new project which was intended to produce a successor to the Caravelle. The project was relatively ambitious, having the aim of producing a viable supersonic transport that possessed the same general size and range as the Caravelle. It was decided that the envisioned supersonic airliner should be naturally named after the firm's recent success, thus the Super-Caravelle name was applied to the design. Ultimately, the work on the Super-Caravell would be merged with similar work that had been undertaken by Britain's Bristol Aeroplane Company, and would result in the development of Concorde.|$|R
50|$|The {{stall warning}} system {{utilizes}} a <b>stall</b> warning <b>vane</b> {{on each side}} of the nose. The vanes provide regulated voltage input to the angle-of-attack transducers, modified by a stall warning bias box to compensate for flap position. The angle-of-attack transducer supplies a proportional voltage to the angle-of-attack of the aircraft. When the aircraft speed is 7% above stall, the stall warning energizes a control column shaker that produces a low-frequency buffet signal through the control column to warn the crew. When both angle-of-attack transducer vanes increase to 5% above stall, the pitch servo commands an aircraft nose down attitude. The force applied in the nose down direction is 80 pounds at the control wheel. When the angle-of-attack transducer vanes decrease below the stall point, the nose down command is removed. An angle-of-attack indicator translates signals from the stall warning system into visual indications of the aircraft angle-of-attack and allows the crew to monitor the proximity of stall caution zone. The indicator face is divided into green (safe), yellow (caution) and red (danger) segments.|$|R
40|$|At {{the request}} of the Air Material Command, Army Air Forces an {{investigation}} of the low-speed, power-off stability and control characteristics of the McDonnell XP- 85 airplane is being conducted in the Langley free-flight tunnel. The XP- 85 airplane is a jet propelled, parasite fighter with a 34 deg sweepback at the wing quarter chord. It was designed to be carried in a bomb bay of the B- 36 air plane. The first portion of the investigation consists of a preliminary evaluation of the stability and control characteristics of the airplane from force and fight tests of an unballasted 1 / 5 -scale model. The second portion of the investigation consists of test of a properly balasted 1 / 10 -scale model which will include a study of the stability of the Xp- 85 when attached to the trapeze for retraction into the B- 36 bomb bay. The results of the preliminary test with the 1 / 5 -scale model are presented herein. This portion fo the investigation included tests of the model with various center fin arrangements. Both the design nose flap and a <b>stall</b> control <b>vane</b> were investigated...|$|R
