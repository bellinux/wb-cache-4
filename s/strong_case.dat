He had already made a <b>strong</b> <b>case</b> that the mystic and philosophical elements which allowed Freemasonry to evolve from a purely operative to a speculative society were likely to have been imported from some aspects of the Hermeticism practised during the Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|I think a <b>strong</b> <b>case</b> can be {{made that}} {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E

5|$|In 1868, Thomas Huxley {{published}} On {{the animals}} which are most nearly intermediate between birds and reptiles, making a <b>strong</b> <b>case</b> for the bird-dinosaur ancestral link. Huxley's proposal that birds arose from dinosaurs – {{based primarily on}} his observation of the similarities between Archaeopteryx and Compsognathus – remained respectable and widespread in the paleontological community until the publication of The Origin of Birds. Heilmann {{more than anyone else}} was responsible for a widespread rejection of the dinosaur-bird link. His conclusions involved more than the mere rejection of a dinosaurian ancestry for birds, however: for instance, he favored the arboreal origin of avian flight, he allied birds firmly with reptiles instead of mammals, and he was responsible for finally putting an end to the idea that birds descended from pterosaurs. Several aspects of his research have continued to be influential long after its publication.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{the tomb}} of Neferhotep I has not been {{formally}} identified, although a <b>strong</b> <b>case</b> now exists {{for it to be}} in Abydos. Since 2013 a team of archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania under the direction of Josef W. Wegner has been excavating a Late Middle Kingdom—Second Intermediate Period royal necropolis in Abydos, {{at the foot of a}} natural hill known to the ancient Egyptians as the Mountain of Anubis. The necropolis is located just next to the massive funerary complex of Senusret III of the 12th Dynasty and comprises two further large tombs, likely to have been pyramids built during the mid-13th Dynasty, as well as no less than eight royal tombs, possibly dating to the Abydos Dynasty. One of the large tombs, which was extensively plundered of goods and stones during the Second Intermediate Period, known today as tomb S10, is now believed to belong to king Sobekhotep IV, Neferhotep's brother, on the basis of several finds showing Sobkehotep's name from the nearby royal tombs, such as that of Woseribre Senebkay. As a corollary, Wegner suggested that the anonymous, large, neighboring tomb S9 could have belonged to Neferhotep I. Egyptologists have also noted that both kings were very active in the Abydos region during their reigns.|$|E
5|$|Born in Travnik in Austrian-occupied Bosnia, Andrić {{attended}} {{high school}} in Sarajevo, where he became {{an active member of}} several South Slav national youth organizations. Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914, Andrić was arrested and imprisoned by the Austro-Hungarian police, who suspected his involvement in the plot. As the authorities were unable to build a <b>strong</b> <b>case</b> against him, he spent much of the war under house arrest, only being released following a general amnesty for such cases in July 1917. After the war, he studied South Slavic history and literature at universities in Zagreb and Graz, eventually attaining his Ph.D in Graz in 1924. He worked in the diplomatic service of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1920–1923 and again from 1924–1941. In 1939, he became Yugoslavia's ambassador to Germany, but his tenure ended in April 1941 with the German-led invasion of his country. Shortly after the invasion, Andrić returned to German-occupied Belgrade. He lived quietly in a friend's apartment for the duration of World War II, in conditions that some biographers liken to house arrest, and wrote some of his most important works, including Na Drini ćuprija (The Bridge on the Drina).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the suppression of}} the product rule in litigation from a rent seeking perspective. We show that there are some important arguments in favor of not applying the product rule. First, only when the product rule is suppressed is the plaintiff's equilibrium probability of winning equal to the product of the inherent quality of the several issues at stake. The probability of winning is always lower when the product rule is used, and this is especially so for relatively <b>strong</b> <b>cases.</b> Second, for many of the weakest cases, the expected value of the plaintiff is larger when the product rule is used. Third, for relatively <b>strong</b> <b>cases,</b> the litigation expenditures are typically larger when the product rule is used. This further decreases the plaintiff's expected value for <b>strong</b> <b>cases...</b>|$|R

5|$|Eusebius' {{first version}} of the Chronicon was written in 303, and his second in the mid-320s; Jerome's revision, {{translation}} and continuation dates to 380. The original Greek is lost; it is largely through Jerome's Latin and through an Armenian translation unrelated to Jerome that {{the substance of the}} original survives. Eusebius' original did cover Philip's rule—Jerome's continuation of the Chronicon only covers the period from 325 to 378—but the sections regarding Philip's Christianity do not survive in the Armenian translation. In the Armenian, all references to Arabs are omitted. Philip's celebration of the millennium is preserved, while his supposed Christianity is only implied in the entry on Decius' persecution. Jerome's Chronicon is, therefore, the nearest we can get to Eusebius' early statements on Philip's Christianity. That Jerome calls Philip primus in the Chronicon thus admits of two interpretations: either he found it in Eusebius, or he added it independently, based on other sources available to him. Shahîd argues that, while the text would offer a <b>strong</b> <b>case</b> for Philip's Christianity either way, the former interpretation is more plausible. Shahîd believes that primus appeared in Eusebius {{first version of}} the Chronicon, but may have been edited out for the second version—by the mid 320s, Eusebius had become Constantine's panegyrist, and was understandably loath to praise his subject's ignoble predecessors.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, in which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone or a light is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), such as an air puff, that elicits a blink response. After such repeated presentations of the CS and US, the CS will eventually elicit a blink before the US, a conditioned response or CR. Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the cerebellar cortex would abolish learning of a conditionally timed blink response. If cerebellar outputs are pharmacologically inactivated while leaving the inputs and intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails to show any response, whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place—these facts taken together make a <b>strong</b> <b>case</b> that the learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|The {{dramatic}} {{contrast between}} Ranavalona's isolationism and her son's pro-European stance represented an abrupt reversal of policy that threatened the traditional sociopolitical order. Radama's absolutism in pursuing dramatic reforms in disregard {{of the advice}} of his ministers ultimately turned them against him. In a coup led by his Prime Minister, Rainivoninahitriniony, Radama II was strangled on May 12, 1863. His wife Rabodo, who took the throne name Rasoherina, was allowed by the ministers to succeed her husband on the condition that she and future sovereigns would no longer rule unilaterally, but rather in concert with the Hova (the class of free citizens) as represented by the position of Prime Minister. The public was informed that Radama had committed suicide and that his body had been unceremoniously interred in a tomb in Ilafy. However, there soon emerged rumors – believed by prominent foreigners Jean Laborde and William Ellis – that Radama lived and was making plans to reclaim the throne. A <b>strong</b> <b>case</b> has since been {{made on the basis of}} significant evidence that Radama may indeed have revived after the strangling and lived to old age in anonymity near Lake Kinkony in the northwestern part of the island.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the large-scale fields of eight stronger and eight weaker cyclones prior to rapid cyclogenesis to help explain their subsequent deepening rate. The cyclones all commenced their rapid development {{within the same}} small geographical region over the Kuroshio and are compared using composites, ensembles and individual case studies. Colder air and stronger anticyclogenesis over East Asia track the <b>stronger</b> <b>cases</b> along the Kuroshio, while the weaker cases tend to track across Japan. Anticylogenesis is also present {{to the east of}} the <b>stronger</b> <b>cases</b> which hence have warm advection ahead of them. The weaker cases generally form as transitory features in the northerly flow to the west of large cyclones and so have cold advection ahead of them. This affects a deep layer, producing a ridge-trough couplet at 500 mb for the <b>stronger</b> <b>cases</b> and a more zonal flow above the weaker cases...|$|R

25|$|Although the Professional Lawn Tennis Association issued rankings {{at the end}} of 1952 {{in which}} they called Segura the world pro no. 1, with Gonzales second, the PLTA rankings were {{notoriously}} quirky.
