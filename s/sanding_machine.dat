50|$|All modern sanding {{projects}} are completed with specialized sanding machines. The majority of material is removed by large 220 volt belt or drum sander. Belt sanders are preferred for the continuous sand paper belt design to prevent <b>sanding</b> <b>machine</b> marks in floors. The belt sander {{was invented by}} Eugen Laegler in 1969 out of Güglingen, Germany. 90% of the area can be reached with the belt/drum sander. The remaining 10% left such as edges, corners, under cabinets, and stairs, are sanded by an edge <b>sanding</b> <b>machine.</b> A finishing machine known as a multi disc sander or buffer is then used for the final sanding steps.|$|E

5000|$|Milan {{designed}} and built a multipurpose drum- and belt-sander, dubbed the “Emil Machine” by his woodworking colleagues. [...] It had interchangeable pneumatic drums of different sizes and a long slack belt. The tension on the belt could be adjusted to achieve a shape that matched the outside curve of a work. A detachable plate could be installed below the upper belt to sand flat surfaces. These power sanding methods were used to rapidly shape the work and to refine and smooth the piece before applying lacquer or linseed oil. A crude slack belt <b>sanding</b> <b>machine,</b> possibly {{designed and}} built by Milan, was in use at the Buckridge shop in the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|Introduction of {{engineered}} nanoparticles (ENPs) into traditional {{surface coatings}} (e. g., paints, lacquers, fillers) {{may result in}} new exposures to both workers and consumers and possibly also a new risk to their health. During finishing and renovation, such products {{may also be a}} substantial source of exposure to ENPs or aggregates thereof. This study investigates the particle size distributions (5. 6 [*]nm– 19. 8 [*]μm) and the total number of dust particles generated during sanding of ENP-doped paints, lacquers, and fillers as compared to their conventional counterparts. In all products, the dust emissions from sanding were found to consist of five size modes: three modes under 1 [*]μm and two modes around 1 and 2 [*]μm. Corrected for the emission from the <b>sanding</b> <b>machine,</b> the sanding dust, was dominated by 100 – 300 [*]nm size particles, whereas the mass and surface area spectra were dominated by the micrometer modes. Adding ENPs to the studied products only vaguely affected the geometric mean diameters of the particle modes in the sanding dust when compared to their reference products. However, we observed considerable differences in the number concentrations in the different size modes, but still without revealing a clear effect of ENPs on dust emissions from sanding...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse thesurface quality of black alder (Alnus glutinosa) samples as function of sanding processes based onfour grits sizes, namely 60, 80, 100 and 120. Thesanding process was performed parallel,perpendicular and at 45 degrees angle to the grainorientation of the specimens. The experiments werecarried out on a wide belt <b>sanding</b> <b>machine</b> atNIKMOB Nehoiu Company. Two machiningvariables, feed speed and cutting depth were usedfor the tests. Two roughness parameters, Rk(processing roughness parameter) and Rpk (fuzzygrain roughness parameter) were determined byemploying the optical profilometer type MicroProfFRT, on dry and wett areas of the samples. All datawere processed by using a nonlinear regressionmethod respecting an equation of 2 nd degree typewith two variables. The ANOVA analysis was alsoused to evaluate the data by applying fiveindependent variables, namely: sanding program,sanding direction, feed speed and cutting depth forthe two statement of surface, with and withoutwetting. The results of the study revealed that thewetting of samples did not show a better quality ofsanded surfaces. However when the samples weresanded at 45 degrees angle and parallel to the grainorientation, overall surface quality of the samplesimproved compared to perpendicular direction. It wasalso found that the cumulative effect of factors wasmore representative on the roughness parametersthan the situation when taken individually. It appearsthat based on the findings in this work suchapproach can be successfully applied in woodproducts industry including furniture manufacturing tohave a more efficient use of the raw material infurther processing steps such as finishing...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{production}} and applications of manufactured nano objects (MNOs) {{have become a}} source for human exposure and therefore raise concerns and questions about the possible health effects. In this study, the potential release of nano objects, their agglomerates, and aggregates (NOAA) {{as a result of}} sanding of hardwood treated with MNOs-containing coating was examined. Two types of MNO-containing coating were compared with untreated hardwood that allowed the evaluation of the influence of the chemical composition on the release of particles. Furthermore, the rotation speed of the sander and the grit size of the sanding paper were varied in order to assess their influence on the release of particles. Measurements were conducted in a gas-Tight chamber with a volume of 19. 5 m 3 in which ventilation was minimized during experiments. Particle size distributions were assessed by scanning mobility particle sizer, aerodynamic particle sizer, and electrical low pressure impactor. Furthermore, aerosol number concentrations (Nanotracer), active surface area (LQ 1), and fractionated mass (Cascade Impactor) were measured before, during, and after sanding. Scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX) analysis was performed to adequately characterize the morphology, size, and chemical composition of released particles. SEM/EDX analysis indicated that sanding surfaces treated with MNO-containing coating did not release the designated MNO as free primary particles. In both coatings, clusters of MNO were perceived embedded in and attached to micro-sized wood and/or coating particles created by sanding the coated surface. Real-Time measurements indicated a lower release of micro-sized particles from sanding of surfaces treated with Coating I than from sanding untreated surfaces or surfaces treated with Coating II. A substantial increase in nanosized and a slight increase in micro-sized particles was perceived as the rotation speed of the sander increased. However, most nanosized particles were most likely emitted by the <b>sanding</b> <b>machine.</b> No effect of the grit size on the release of particles was detected. © 2016 The Author 2016.

50|$|Preparation is {{the first}} stage of the sanding process. All nails which {{protrude}} above the boards are punched down.

50|$|Experts {{from the}} United States Bureau of Mines {{concluded}} that the connection to the residue gas line was faulty. The connection had allowed gas to leak into the school, and since natural gas is invisible and is odorless, the leak was unnoticed. The <b>sanding</b> <b>machine's</b> switch {{is believed to have}} caused a spark that ignited the gas-air mixture. To reduce the damage of future leaks, the Texas Legislature began mandating within weeks of the explosion that thiols (mercaptans) be added to natural gas. The strong odor of many thiols makes leaks quickly detectable. The practice quickly spread worldwide.|$|R
