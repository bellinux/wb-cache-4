The process can be integrated into a conventional film line with plasma {{treatment of}} the unoriented film at atmospheric pressure, followed by a bath and then a <b>stenter</b> <b>for</b> bi-axial orientation. USE - Plasma treatment to increase surface tension of articles or film of thermoplastic polymer, e. g. for use in metalizing, printing, laminating, coating (claimed). ADVANTAGE - Effectiveness of plasma treatment is stable against subsequent heating or deformation...|$|R
40|$|Key words：straightening, tubular product, flatten, bend Abstract ： Based on the {{thorough}} {{analysis of}} the disadvantage of the traditional calculation system <b>for</b> <b>straightening</b> force, the new calculation system <b>for</b> <b>straightening</b> force is built according {{to the analysis of}} roller-shaped curve, flattening straightening and bend straightening with the application of mechanics of materials and bend beam theory. It is testified by practical use that the calculating accuracy of the new calculation system <b>for</b> <b>straightening</b> force satisfies the actual engineering requirement. New six-rollers straightening machines are designed and manufactured according to the new calculation system, which obtain notable economical and social benefits. Traditional calculation system <b>for</b> <b>straightening</b> force The calculation system <b>for</b> <b>straightening</b> force in the six-rollers straightening machine was proposed in Document [1] firstly in domestic, which was {{based on the idea that}} the flattening calculation formula can be deduced from the stress of the beam and the elastic deformation of the ring in mechanics of materials.
