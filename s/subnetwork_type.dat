30|$|The first <b>subnetwork</b> (<b>type</b> A, open science, Fig.  1 a) {{is typical}} of {{academics}} collaborating to patents with scientists belonging to other open science organisations. These structures are composed of homogenous actors and the relational style adopted {{is very close to}} that of open science organisation. The patent arises almost directly from research work and the attribution of property rights to the university is straightforward.|$|E
30|$|The third <b>subnetwork</b> (<b>type</b> C, {{disconnected}} subnetworks, Fig.  1 c) {{emerges from}} inventions owned by private firms to which individual academics participate as inventors {{and without any}} involvement of the university as organisation. In this subnetwork, academics {{play the role of}} brokers, connecting several non-academic co-inventors. Patents often arise {{as the result of the}} consultancy work of academics. In the general case, the research work is carried out mainly with the resources made available by the private firm that retains the property rights of the invention.|$|E
30|$|The second <b>subnetwork</b> (<b>type</b> B, {{multiple}} interactions, Fig.  1 b) {{arises from}} cooperation of several academic scientists with one (or more) private firm (and industrial inventors), {{with the university}} {{in the role of}} assignee, at least in one occurrence. In this subnetwork, brokerage and gatekeeping roles of academic are enhanced. Overall, it represents an example of the archetypical hybrid interaction between the two worlds of science and private companies. This subnetwork seems structurally more conducive to a multifaceted knowledge diffusion because of the different channels through which knowledge flows. The attribution of property rights can be more difficult here, and the logic of appropriability can clash with the objective of knowledge diffusion.|$|E
30|$|The study {{analysed}} micro-level interactions {{by exploring}} the subnetwork structures in owned and invented patents verifying if the typologies identified in previous studies—open science (type A), multiple interactions (type B) and disconnected <b>subnetworks</b> (<b>type</b> C)—were a good instrument {{to understand the}} change occurred in the network of collaboration in the mentioned period. These typologies represent different relational styles as well as different solution to the appropriablity problem. From this second point of view, the type A claims for a university ownership whereas type C claims for a company’s ownership. The <b>type</b> B <b>subnetworks</b> represent the most complex case (multiple ties linking organisations as well as industrial and academic inventors) where the attribution of property right could be more uncertain. The results confirmed that the three previously mentioned subnetwork typologies could be identified in particular regions of the network structure.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the results of a}} network {{analysis}} applied to academic patent data in a subsector of the chemical field in Italy in the period 2000 – 2011. In particular, we analyse the micro-level interactions to point out the different network structures shaped by university-owned and university-invented patents. We detected three <b>subnetwork</b> typologies (labelled <b>type</b> A, B, and C) that exemplify different qualitative relational structures as well as different attributions to propriety rights. Type A (open science) exemplifies the typical owned patent; type B (multiple ties) represents the hybrid structure with multiple ties and involvement of academics as individuals and of universities as organisation; <b>type</b> C (disconnected <b>subnetworks)</b> represents the typical invented patent with no role of universities as organisation. The whole network seems to show a breaking point in terms of connectivity around 2005, a year that marks a change in policy rule and strategic orientation of Italian universities towards patenting. After 2005, the number of actors grew disproportionally and the network appears disconnected in several comparable components. Also, the composition in terms of <b>subnetwork</b> <b>types</b> changed. The overall picture seems to underline a big structural change dominated by the important increase of academic patenting both direct (university ownership) and indirect (increasing academic patenting).|$|R

40|$|Abstract- It is {{supposed}} {{that within a}} tactical environment radio based broadcast communication is used to link subnetworks and/or hosts. It is a typical requirement for radio links within this environment to operate under EMCON (Emission Control) conditions. Hence these subnetworks or hosts, although being able to receive data, {{are not able to}} send any information back. Consequently, when being under EMCON restrictions, they cannot run any dialogue oriented protocol (e. g. application protocols like telnet, ftp, mail etc. or routing protocols like DVMRP, PIM etc.) to the outside world. However in a tactical environment it is highly desired that hosts being under EMCON restrictions continue in taking part in the information dissemination process for messages or files. This information distribution can be done very efficiently over radio based networks by using multicast addressing technology. As commercial routers normally do not support the military <b>subnetwork</b> <b>types,</b> it is necessary to develop special network adapters primarily offering an efficient access to the specific military network. This paper will make a proposal, how the requirements of conventional unicast and multicast routing protocols can be fulfilled under EMCON restrictions to offer at least simplex connectionless traffic to the remote subnetworks or hosts. ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} few years, rich-club (RC) {{organization}} has been studied as a possible brain-connectivity organization model for large-scale brain networks. At the same time, empirical and simulated data of neurophysiological models have demonstrated the significant role of intra-frequency and inter-frequency coupling among distinct brain areas. The current study investigates further {{the importance of these}} couplings using recordings of resting-state magnetoencephalographic activity obtained from 30 mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) subjects and 50 healthy controls. Intra-frequency and inter-frequency coupling modes are incorporated in a single graph to detect group differences within individual rich-club <b>subnetworks</b> (<b>type</b> I networks) and networks connecting RC nodes {{with the rest of the}} nodes (type II networks). Our results show a higher probability of inter-frequency coupling for (δ–γ 1), (δ–γ 2), (θ–β), (θ–γ 2), (α–γ 2), (γ 1 –γ 2) and intra-frequency coupling for (γ 1 –γ 1) and (δ–δ) for both type I and type II networks in the mTBI group. Additionally, mTBI and control subjects can be correctly classified with high accuracy (98. 6 %), whereas a general linear regression model can effectively predict the subject group using the ratio of type I and type II coupling in the (δ, θ), (δ, β), (δ, γ 1), and (δ, γ 2) frequency pairs. These findings support the presence of an RC organization simultaneously with dominant frequency interactions within a single functional graph. Our results demonstrate a hyperactivation of intrinsic RC networks in mTBI subjects compared to controls, which can be seen as a plausible compensatory mechanism for alternative frequency-dependent routes of information flow in mTBI subjects...|$|R

40|$|We discuss {{two views}} on {{extending}} existing methods for complex network modeling which we dub the communities {{first and the}} networks first view, respectively. Inspired by the networks first view that we attribute to White, Boorman, and Breiger (1976) [1], we formulate the multiple-networks stochastic blockmodel (MNSBM), which seeks to separate the observed network into <b>subnetworks</b> of different <b>types</b> and where the problem of inferring structure in each subnetwork becomes easier. We show how this model is specified in a generative Bayesian framework where parameters can be inferred efficiently using Gibbs sampling. The result is an effective multiple-membership model without the drawbacks of introducing complex definitions of "groups" and how they interact. We demonstrate results on the recovery of planted structure in synthetic networks and show very encouraging results on link prediction performances using multiple-networks models {{on a number of}} real-world network data sets...|$|R
40|$|PublishedLarge-scale {{molecular}} interaction {{data sets}} {{have the potential}} to provide a comprehensive, system-wide understanding of biological function. Although individual molecules can be promiscuous in terms of their contribution to function, molecular functions emerge from the specific interactions of molecules giving rise to modular organisation. As functions often derive from a range of mechanisms, we demonstrate that they are best studied using networks derived from different sources. Implementing a graph partitioning algorithm we identify subnetworks in yeast protein-protein interaction (PPI), genetic interaction and gene co-regulation networks. Among these subnetworks we identify cohesive subgraphs that we expect to represent functional modules in the different data types. We demonstrate significant overlap between the subgraphs generated from the different data types and show these overlaps can represent related functions as represented by the Gene Ontology (GO). Next, we investigate the correspondence between our subgraphs and the Gene Ontology. This revealed varying degrees of coverage of the biological process, molecular function and cellular component ontologies, dependent on the data type. For example, subgraphs from the PPI show enrichment for 84 %, 58 % and 93 % of annotated GO terms, respectively. Integrating the interaction data into a combined network increases the coverage of GO. Furthermore, the different annotation types of GO are not predominantly associated with one of the interaction data types. Collectively our results demonstrate that successful capture of functional relationships by network data depends on both the specific biological function being characterised and the type of network data being used. We identify functions that require integrated information to be accurately represented, demonstrating the limitations of individual data <b>types.</b> Combining interaction <b>subnetworks</b> across data <b>types</b> is therefore essential for fully understanding the complex and emergent nature of biological function.

40|$|Background: Scientists in {{pharmaceutical}} as well {{as academic}} research work together to solve the challenging puzzle from the basic causes of disease {{at the level of}} genes, proteins and cells up to a marketed new drug. Analyses of mode of action (MoA) of new chemical entities (NCEs) are a very important step in the development of new drugs. One distinguishes between effects induced by modulating the compounds’ actual target protein (on-target effects) and effects induced by additional, possibly unknown targets (off-target effects). Quite often knowledge about either of these effects is limited. Since MoA is mainly triggered by the interplay of proteins or signaling cascades, investigating the change and subsequent influence of the changed molecules in a protein interaction (PI) network is a promising initial step to further analyses. As more and more data from diverse sources becomes available, the integration of this knowledge is important for generating a deeper insight into biology. In addition, expression experiments based on disease tissue and/or compound treatment are frequently conducted to get insight into transcriptional changes that could explain compounds’ MoA. Status quo: MoA could be analyzed by investigating those parts of a PI network that show changes based on compound treatment. Mathematical or graph theoretical in silico methods to identify interesting parts of a network based on different criteria are widely used. Criteria range from detection of highly connected subgraphs to subgraphs maximizing weights assigned to parts of the network under investigation. These methods can be transferred to biology and can be used to, e. g. identify condition responsive <b>subnetworks</b> on various <b>types</b> of molecular networks. Present questions addressed mainly focus on the detection of subnetworks enriched in information from functional genomics, e. g. differentially expressed genes. They neglect the existence of distance regulatory functions on the post-transcriptional {{as well as}} post-translational level like miRNA interference or protein phosphorylation. Further, available methods usually detect relatively large modules. It is easily possible that more processes, i. e. the on- and several off-target effects, are covered by one larger module. Thus, the individual effects are difficult to detect and interpret. To be able to derive individual effects, it is necessary to reveal small modules that are related to the individual effects present in the biological system under investigation. Methods & Results: In this work, I made use of a gene expression data set investigating the inhibition of the TGF-beta signaling pathway by different compounds targeting TGF-betaR 1. To gain a sound basis for follow-up analyses, different aspects of how to select the best suited normalization procedure for the underlying expression data are proposed {{in the first part of}} this thesis. To analyze compounds’ MoA, I propose a method that weights interactions between proteins based on different kinds of evidence. In this method, the relevance of the proteins is based on the biological relatedness to other possibly not deregulated protein coding genes. Thereby, analyses are expanded beyond transcriptional deregulation. To elucidate the biological relatedness, information on molecular function, biological processes and cellular compartment, information on transcription factor binding sites and literature-based confidence scores are integrated for weighting the edges between proteins. To transfer the network into the biological context of interest, expression experiments are used as anchoring points for the analyses. Further, I introduce modEx, a method to extract small modules out of a weighted protein interaction network. Modules extracted using modEx reflect the individual effects present in the biological system under investigation. For the expression data set used, the proposed edge scoring is shown to be superior to the widely accepted STRING scoring. Furthermore, modEx extracts modules that represent the underlying mechanism better than jActiveModule, a commonly used subgraph extraction method. These newly proposed approaches are applied to elucidate the MoA, i. e. the on- as well as off-target effects, of compounds. They are shown to grant a more focused view on the effects of compounds than current state-of-the-art methods applied for the analysis of gene expression data...|$|R
