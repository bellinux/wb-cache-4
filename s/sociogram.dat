5000|$|In the 1930s Jacob Moreno, a {{psychologist}} in the Gestalt tradition, {{arrived in the}} United States. He developed the <b>sociogram</b> and presented {{it to the public}} in April 1933 at a convention of medical scholars. Moreno claimed that [...] "before the advent of sociometry no one knew what the interpersonal structure of a group 'precisely' looked like (Moreno, 1953). The <b>sociogram</b> was a representation of the social structure of a group of elementary school students. The boys were friends of boys and the girls were friends of girls {{with the exception of one}} boy who said he liked a single girl. The feeling was not reciprocated. This network representation of social structure was found so intriguing that it was printed in The New York Times (April 3, 1933, page 17). The <b>sociogram</b> has found many applications and has grown into the field of social network analysis.|$|E

40|$|Social network {{analysis}} is a potentially useful reflective tool {{that could be}} used by public health practitioners to assess the overall composition of their networks, strengthen collaborations with other community partners, and evaluate network function. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to report on public health practitioners’ experiences with social {{network analysis}}. Thirteen public health practitioners, each associated with their own advocacy-oriented community collaboration, participated in the study. Specifically, the intervention consisted of social network analysis output (social network analysis measures and <b>sociograms)</b> and a facilitated discussion to stimulate reflection on the respondents’ professional networks. Semi-structured interviews were conducted two weeks later to solicit participants’ reactions to the <b>sociograms</b> and the accompanying measures, and elicit thoughts about how social network analysis might have an impact on their work. Participants commented on ways in which social network analysis could be applied in practice, such as using <b>sociograms</b> to raise awareness of the nature of current networks, as a planning and evaluation tool, to identify gaps, and to assess the degree of sustainability of current networks...|$|R
50|$|One {{motivation}} {{for the study of}} graph theory is its application to sociograms described by Jacob L. Moreno. For instance the adjacency matrix of a <b>sociogram</b> was used by Leon Festinger. Festinger identified the graph theory clique with the social clique and examined the diagonal of the cube of a groups’ adjacency matrix to detect cliques. Harary joined with Ian Ross to improve on Festinger's clique detection.|$|E
50|$|Those {{points on}} a <b>sociogram</b> who have many choices are called Stars. Those with {{few or no}} choices are called isolates.

This article will contribute to these debates by critically reflecting on a qualitative study of gambling where social network research methods were adapted and applied to narrative interviews. Egocentric <b>sociograms</b> (maps of participant social networks, using a name generation question and concentric circles) were created for 23 participants.

5000|$|He {{developed}} sociometry {{within the}} new sciences, although its ultimate purpose is transcendence and not science. 'By making choices based on criteria, overt and energetic, Moreno hoped that individuals {{would be more}} spontaneous, and organisations and groups structures would become fresh, clear and lively.' [...] One of Moreno's innovations in sociometry was {{the development of the}} <b>sociogram,</b> a systematic method for graphically representing individuals as points/nodes and the relationships between them as lines/arcs. Moreno, who wrote extensively of his thinking, applications and findings, also founded a journal entitled Sociometry.|$|E
50|$|Under the Social Discipline Model, sociograms are {{sometimes}} {{used to reduce}} misbehavior in a classroom environment. A <b>sociogram</b> is constructed after students answer {{a series of questions}} probing for affiliations with other classmates. The diagram can then be used to identify pathways for social acceptance for misbehaving students. In this context, the resulting sociograms are known as a friendship chart. Often, the most important person/thing is in a bigger bubble in relation to everyone else. The size of the bubble represents the importance, with the biggest bubble meaning most important and the smallest representing the least important.|$|E

J.L. Moreno discovered the underlying theory of Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, social network, in 1932 when he drew his first <b>sociogram,</b> which mapped interactions between individuals and showed that, despite degrees of separation, individuals influenced others in their network.|$|E

40|$|Socio-technical {{networks}} can be productively modeled {{at several}} granularities, including {{the interaction of}} actors, how this interaction is mediated by digital artifacts, and <b>sociograms</b> that model direct ties between the actors themselves.

40|$|Visualizing {{social network}} data into sociograms plays an {{important}} role in communicating information about network characteristics. Previous studies have shown that human perceptions of network features can be affected by the layout of a <b>sociogram</b> [McGrath et al. 1996, 1997]. An empirical user study has been conducted to investigate effectiveness of five different network visualization conventions and impact of edge crossings on <b>sociogram</b> perceptions, using both quantitative performance and preference measures and qualitative questionnaire study. This paper reports results and findings of the questionnaire study. We relate qualitative questionnaire results with quantitative findings and discuss their implications for <b>sociogram</b> design. We found that subjects had a strong preference of placing nodes on the top or in the center to highlight importance, and clustering nodes in the same group and separating groups to highlight groups. They had tendency to believe that nodes in the center or on the top are more important, and nodes in close proximity belong to the same group. Some preliminary recommendations for <b>sociogram</b> design and hypotheses about human reading behaviors are proposed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{total of}} 1, 053 {{students}} participated in this study, which compared the social status of middle-school {{students with learning disabilities}} to a randomly chosen sample of students without disabilities. Information was gathered from a forced-choice <b>Sociogram,</b> a self-rating questionnaire, and a teacher rating scale. Descriptive statistics revealed that students with learning disabilities earned lower scores on the teacher rating scale and the self-rating questionnaire. Similarly, com-pared to their nondisabled peers, these students received more negative and fewer positive votes on the <b>Sociogram.</b> For all students, attractive and athletic votes were highly correlated with positive votes on the <b>Sociogram.</b> Recommendations are of-fered for future sociometric research. The social status of students with learning dis-abilities has been a topic of considerable interest to researchers for over a decade.

40|$|Blogpost, [URL] <b>sociograms</b> are {{frequently}} considered {{as the first}} examples of social network analysis and visualization. Mapping the social affinities {{of a group of}} individuals, Moreno’s first <b>sociograms</b> visualize the relationships between pupils in a classroom: who wants to be sitting next to whom? Each child can choose two others, for results that suggest that sociabilities are changing over time: the proportion of attractions between boys and girls decrease, community structures are formed and then disappear, etc. Sociological and mathematical interests of this work have already been discussed in thousands of publications. This post simply questions the visual practices introduced by Moreno and compares them to a more modern way of visualizing such networks. It is clear that the hand drawing causes a visual bias, particularly because of Moreno’s decision to separate girls and boys into two predefined groups. Visualizations below, for the 8 classes (1 st to 8 th grade) show that this bipartition is not always justified since communities are formed inside them (the inter-sexual “bridges” between boys and girls are not the only structural bridges between cliques) ...|$|R
40|$|Companies, {{academic}} institutions and not-for-profit organisations in the High Energy Physics community have recently expressed {{a need for}} a service or tool that can simplify and improve the partner selection process in research and development (R&D) -collaborations. Today, partner selection is carried through differently, from organisation to organisation. It is often an informal process, heavily influenced by managements? personal networks. The literature, however, suggests a more rational and systematic two-step approach called searching and screening. This document proposes a conceptual framework for partner selection in R&D-collaborations, as a solution to this challenge. The framework is based on prior literature, and empirical findings from CERN. The most important organisational characteristics in any R&D-collaboration are capability and knowledge concerning the technological challenges of the collaboration. The success of the collaboration is dependent on these characteristics, and so are the prospects for knowledge transfer among the participating organisations. Thus the ideal partner for R&D-collaboration should be the most capable or knowledgeable organisation that is either applying or developing the technologies most relevant to the collaboration?s central challenges. In addition, the organisation should preferably hold beneficial contacts throughout its organisational network, which the collaboration can draw benefits from. Prior studies have suggested that capability and knowledge can be measured by the means of bibliometric documents, such as publications and patents. These documents contain details on their affiliated organisations. That information can be used to create graphical representations of interorganisational networks; so called <b>sociograms.</b> A set of <b>sociograms</b> based on publications and patents in a given technological field, can reveal the most capable and knowledgeable organisations in that field. Five technologies related to Position-Sensitive Solid-State particle detectors are reviewed in this study. <b>Sociograms</b> of the organisations developing and using each of the technologies have been created, by the means of an IT tool. The IT tool constitutes the core functions of the conceptual framework. Several technical experts affiliated with CERN have evaluated the pertinence of the <b>sociograms,</b> and provided feedback on the methods of the framework and its corresponding IT tool. Interorganisational R&D-collaboration is a significant driver for technological innovation. Many revolutionary discoveries in medical science, power production and computer technology have been developed and commercialised as a result of collaborative arrangements. It is therefore in the interest of humanity to promote and create incentives for this kind of cooperation. </p...|$|R

30|$|Let us {{note that}} the <b>sociogram</b> does not contain data on verbal or written communication, ie., the {{explicit}} content of communication between the network’s members). Rather, the <b>sociogram</b> shows us the communicative behavior of each individual based on two primitive data types: a) data about who called who and b) data {{about the number of}} times where communication occurred between each pair of individuals. Thus, because the social network measure is built from these two simple data types, it is both practical and challenging to analyze whether the centrality measures have the ability to predict the outcomes of a judicial process.|$|E
