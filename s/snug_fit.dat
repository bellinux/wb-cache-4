25|$|The {{internal}} frame backpack {{is a recent}} innovation, invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, {{who went on to}} found Lowe Alpine and Lowepro, companies specializing in backpacks and other forms of carrying bags for various equipment. An internal-frame pack has a large fabric section around an {{internal frame}} composed of strips of either aluminum, titanium or plastic, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. A complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The internal frame permits the pack to fit closely to the wearer's back and minimizes shifting of the load, which is desirable when participating in activities that involve upper-body movement such as scrambling over rocky surfaces and skiing. However, the tight fit reduces ventilation, so these type of packs tend to be more sweaty than external frame packs. The internal construction also allows for a large storage compartment; a few lash points (including webbing loops and straps for sleeping bags and other large items) may be present, but as the frame is completely integrated, it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the pack. Internal frame packs originally suffered from smaller load capacity and less comfortable fit during steady walking, but newer models have improved greatly in these respects. In addition, because of their <b>snug</b> <b>fit,</b> the improved internal frame models have largely replaced external frame backpacks for many activities.|$|E
3000|$|Firefighters {{showed a}} strong {{preference}} for leather boots {{due to the}} following reasons: a <b>snugger</b> <b>fit,</b> lighter weight, better flexibility, ankle support, tactile sensation on the ground, more comfortable foot motion and easier size choice than rubber boots. “I find it’s better flexibility when your foot is bent in the leather boots, you couldn’t get that flexing.

(Site # 1),” “When I got my leather boots I felt like I didn’t {{have to be as}} careful as I moved my leg because my boots weren’t going to fly off anymore (Site # 6).” Some firefighters also described their positive experiences with leather boots, in comparison with rubber boots: “I’ve used rubber boots for years, and what I find with the leather ones is you have better tactile sensation when you’re climbing a ladder you can feel the ladder better (Site # 3).” [...]...|$|R

2500|$|Over {{the next}} few decades, the {{disposable}} diaper industry boomed and the competition between Procter & Gamble's Pampers and Kimberly Clark's Huggies resulted in lower prices and drastic changes to diaper design. Several improvements were made, {{such as the use}} of double gussets to improve diaper fit and containment. As stated in Procter & Gamble's initial 1973 patent for the use of double gussets in a diaper, “The double gusset folded areas tend to readily conform to the thigh portions of the leg of the infant. This allows quick and easy fitting and provides a snug and comfortable diaper fit that will neither bind nor wad on the infant…as a result of this <b>snugger</b> <b>fit</b> obtained because of this fold configuration, the diaper is less likely to leak or, in other words, its containment characteristics are greatly enhanced.” Further developments in diaper design were made, such as the introduction of refastenable tapes, the [...] "hourglass shape" [...] so as to reduce bulk at the crotch area, and the 1984 introduction of super-absorbent material from polymers known as sodium polyacrylate that were originally developed in 1966.|$|R
500|$|The {{precursor}} to the underwire bra {{can be traced back}} to at least 1893, when New Yorker Marie Tucek was granted a patent [...] for a [...] "breast supporter". The breast supporter was described as a modification of the corset, and was very similar to a modern push-up bra designed to support the breasts. It consisted of a plate made of metal, cardboard, or other stiff material, shaped to fit against the torso under the breasts, following the contour of the breasts. It was covered with silk, canvas, or other cloth, which extended above the plate to form a pocket for each breast. The plate curved around the torso and ended near the armpits, held in place and adjusted to a <b>snug</b> <b>fit</b> by shoulder straps that crossed the back, forming an X-shape. It was secured with hook-and-eye closures.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{occasionally}} {{made with}} cast bronze, the pot-de-fer was essentially an iron [...] bottle {{with a narrow}} neck. It was loaded with powder and an iron arrow-like bolt, feathered with iron.

However, this feature is not shown in manuscript illuminations.

50|$|Unlike R/C racing where rubber or foam {{tires are}} {{constantly}} changed and have short life spans, R/C drifting {{can be done}} with tires made of ABS plastic piping.

For 1/10 scale R/C vehicles, 2 in ABS piping <b>fits</b> <b>snug</b> over the appropriate wheels for that scale vehicle. Drift tires can also be created out of white PVC piping due to the inherent frictionless behavior exhibited by PVC on concrete; however, the inherent white coloration of the material can be undesirable.

50|$|Historically, this {{approach}} was seen through the New England colonies - virtually every old home is a clapboard structure fitted with shutters applied in this manner. Compared to the tight-fitting, secure shutters of more Southern climes, it might seem that this style provides less security.

If they were <b>fit</b> <b>snug</b> in the window they might lock up solid with the first October frosts and you may never be able to open the shutter again if the loose stone foundation re-settled in a different stance.Sitting proud on the casing, the shutters simply allowed the house to heave and settle behind them.
