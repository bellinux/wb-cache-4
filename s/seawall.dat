40|$|Understanding the {{ecological}} role of artificial structures, such as <b>seawalls,</b> in shallow coastal waters {{is necessary in}} order to plan sound strategies of conservation and management of natural habitats. In Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia), about 50 % of the foreshore is made of retaining <b>seawalls</b> This study evaluates the changes caused to natural assemblages of organisms by these structures, by comparing intertidal assemblages between <b>seawalls</b> and vertical rocky shores. The following hypotheses were tested: that assemblages on <b>seawalls</b> would differ from those on rocky shores at mid-, but not at low-shore levels; where assemblages differ between habitats, there would be differences in cover/abundances of widespread species; patterns would be consistent among locations and through time; the variability of assemblages at the scales of 10 s of cm and metres would differ between <b>seawalls</b> and rocky shores at mid- and low-shore levels. To test these hypotheses, assemblages on <b>seawalls</b> and rocky shores were sampled at three locations, at roughly 4 -monthly intervals, over a period of about 18 months. Results indicated that mid-shore assemblages on <b>seawalls</b> were different from those on rocky shores, but {{this was not the case}} at low-shore levels. Few taxa were unique to either habitat. Cover of common species of algae and sessile animals and abundances of mobile grazers were variable with few consistent patterns. Variability at the scales sampled differed between habitats and heights on the shore. <b>Seawalls</b> and rocky shores, in general, supported a similar suite of species, but patterns of abundance and variation differed among locations and from height to height in each habitat. The implications of these findings for the future management of <b>seawalls</b> are briefly considered...|$|R
40|$|Proliferation of {{artificial}} structures {{is a common}} feature in urbanized environments. In Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia), much of the coastline is composed of <b>seawalls</b> that have replaced natural habitats, such as rocky shores. Many of these <b>seawalls</b> are made of sandstone blocks or concrete, but {{the effects of the}} type of substratum on assemblages living on <b>seawalls</b> has not been documented. Nevertheless, differences in characteristics of substratum have been shown to affect composition and development of intertidal assemblages. Grazing molluscs are important agents in the structuring of intertidal assemblages affecting numbers and distribution of other organisms. This study compares species and numbers of grazing molluscs at midshore levels between concrete and sandstone <b>seawalls</b> across Sydney Harbour. The two habitats supported a similar suite of species, although in different numbers and frequencies of occurrence, particularly higher on the shore. Therefore, concrete and sandstone <b>seawalls</b> provide different habitat for intertidal molluscs depending on tidal height. Experimental work is needed to assess properly the impact of construction of <b>seawalls</b> with different materials on intertidal biodiversity.

40|$|Artificial structures, such as pier pilings, {{floating}} pontoons, breakwaters and <b>seawalls</b> {{are becoming}} common features of landscape in shallow coastal waters of urbanised areas, in some areas, replacing considerable portions of natural habitats. In Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia), approximately 50 % of the shore {{is composed of}} retaining <b>seawalls</b> or other built habitats. Intertidal <b>seawalls</b> and other similar structures provide new surfaces for colonisation by benthic organisms and therefore provide new intertidal habitats for estuarine animals and plants. They {{have the potential to}} supplement natural habitat by supporting natural assemblages, in terms of species composition and relative abundances. Alternatively, artificial structures may support only a subset of natural assemblages, provide habitat for additional species not found on nearby rocky shores, or provide habitat in which some species are consistently missing and additional species found (a combination of the previous two models). Understanding the ecological role that <b>seawalls</b> and other intertidal structures have in urbanised estuaries is important in planning of developments along foreshores. This study compared intertidal assemblages, at each of three different heights among <b>seawalls</b> and nearby horizontal and vertical rocky shores to specifically test the model that <b>seawalls</b> support the same assemblages of animals and plants as are found on natural rocky reefs. Hypotheses from this model were tested at three study locations by measuring abundances of animals and plants in quadrats in replicate sites on each structure. Results indicated that, at mid- and highshore levels, there were frequent differences between assemblages on natural shores and <b>seawalls.</b> In contrast, at lower levels, differences between assemblages on <b>seawalls</b> and vertical rocky reefs were small compared to differences between sites on each structure. Nevertheless, it appeared that the <b>seawalls</b> and rocky shores examined supported a similar suite of species and most differences were due to relative abundances and frequencies of occurrence of the species present. It is, however, premature to conclude that <b>seawalls</b> support similar assemblages to rocky shores until more intensive sampling has been done, specifically to search for rare species. In addition, until we have more knowledge on ecological processes in these assemblages, <b>seawalls</b> should not be considered as surrogates for natural shores.

40|$|<b>Seawalls</b> are {{commonly}} used {{as a tool for}} coastal defence worldwide. Most previous studies have considered the case of vertical <b>seawalls</b> and descriptions of existing <b>seawalls,</b> rather than the influence of different designs of sloping <b>seawalls</b> on beach erosion. In this study, laboratory investigations of an undistorted moveable bed model were conducted to determine the resulting beach profile of artificial sandy beaches. In the experiments, three different sloping <b>seawalls</b> were considered under erosive wave conditions with a 50 -year return period. The coast of Northern Jiangsu Province, China, is used as a case study. To simulate natural conditions, similarity criteria are developed assuming that the energy dissipation per unit volume along the beach profile is uniform and that the wave properties can be properly scaled by Froude criteria. Field surveys of beach profile changes due to the storm surge induced by Typhoon 9711 were taken to validate the experimental model and good agreements were attained. Spatial profile configurations were studied by examining dominant profile features such as the break point bar and the scour trough on the seawall-backed profiles.

In Indonesia, including in the Semarang City, the impact caused by climate change also occurs. Damage ponds and mangrove forests due to the erosion and sea level rise are examples of the climate change impact. The significant impact of climate change is exacerbated by the lack of public knowledge related to the threat of climate change. It significantly affects to the decreasing income of farmers. These fact underlie the Mercy Corps Indonesia in cooperation with the government of Semarang and the Bintari Foundation to develop activities aimed to strengthening the protection of coastal areas through the development of <b>seawalls</b> through the program named "Enhancing Coastal Community Resilience by Strengthening Mangrove Ecosystem Services and Developing Sustainable Livelihood in Semarang City".

40|$|Artificial <b>seawalls</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly common in marine and estuarine intertidal habitats. These structures are replacing natural habitats at an alarming rate. Previous studies have identified that the species found on artificial <b>seawalls</b> differ from the assemblages found on natural rocky shores. Very {{few studies have examined}} if the behaviours exhibited by species living on <b>seawalls</b> differ from the behaviours of species living on natural shores. This study examines the foraging behaviour of the ecologically important grazing limpet Cellana tramoserica in an attempt to determine if the behaviour of this species is consistent between natural rocky shores and <b>seawalls.</b> Limpets were tracked throughout high tide and several components of their behaviour were analysed. Additionally, chlorophyll a concentration and surface rugosity measures were taken to try and identify the underlying causes of any variation in observed behaviour. This study was done within Sydney Harbour, New South Wales, Australia where 50 % of the shore-line is composed of artificial <b>seawalls.</b> Chlorophyll a concentration was shown to have a more patchy distribution at spatial scales of lOs of centimetres on rocky shores and the surface rugosity was also greater on rocky shores in comparison to <b>seawalls.</b> No significant differences in the total distance travelled during foraging excursion or the direction of foraging routes were identified between the two shores. There were, however, differences in rasping behaviour with rocky shore limpets showing far greater variance in the rate of rasping. This study provides further evidence that artificial <b>seawalls</b> can not be regarded as surrogates for natural rocky shores. KEY WORDS: <b>Seawalls.</b> Artificial structures. Intertidal.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of artificial structures in coastal areas can cause fragmentation {{and loss of}} natural habitats. Previous studies found that variation in colonisation of space at mid-shore levels could account for differences in mature assemblages between <b>seawalls</b> and vertical surfaces on adjacent rocky shores in Sydney Harbour (Australia). This study tests the model {{that the nature of}} the substratum is responsible for different patterns of early colonisation between vertical ledges of rocky shores and <b>seawalls.</b> According to this model, patterns in early colonisation would differ between cleared areas created on vertical surfaces on rocky shores and <b>seawalls,</b> but not between standard surfaces (panels) installed on each structure. Early colonisation of space differed between <b>seawalls</b> and rocky shores, regardless of the type of substratum (clearings versus panels). Differences in relative abundances between structures were evident on both types of substrata for some taxa, while they varied between substrata for others. No taxa, however, showed consistent differences between structures in only the clearings. In addition, the abundance of some taxa differed between panels on the different structures, suggesting that the effects of the substratum were modulated by factors operating differentially between rocky shores and <b>seawalls...</b>|$|R
