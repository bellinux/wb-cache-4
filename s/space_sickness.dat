He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. This ability to move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from <b>space</b> <b>sickness,</b> while members of previous crews did.

5|$|Humans evolved {{for life}} in Earth gravity, and {{exposure}} to weightlessness {{has been shown to}} have deleterious effects on the health of the human body. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. This can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The duration of <b>space</b> <b>sickness</b> varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise. Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} problem {{experienced}} by humans {{in the initial}} hours of weightlessness is known as space adaptation syndrome or SAS, {{commonly referred to as}} <b>space</b> <b>sickness.</b> It is related to motion sickness, and arises as the vestibular system adapts to weightlessness. Symptoms of SAS include nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The first case of SAS was reported by cosmonaut Gherman Titov in 1961. Since then, roughly 45% of all people who have flown in space have suffered from this condition. The duration of <b>space</b> <b>sickness</b> varies, but rarely has it lasted for more than 72 hours, after which the body adjusts to the new environment.|$|E

Attempts are underway to correlate <b>space</b> motion <b>sickness</b> susceptibility to different provocative environments, vestibular and nonvestibular responses, and the rate of acquisition and length of retention of sensory adaptation. <b>Space</b> motion <b>sickness</b> countermeasures under investigation include various drug combinations, of which the equal combination of promethazine and ephedrine {{has been found to be}} as effective as the scopolomine and dexedrine combination, and vestibular adaptation and biofeedback training and autogenic therapy...|$|R

40|$|<b>Space</b> motion <b>sickness</b> was not {{reported}} during the first Apollo missions; however, since Apollo 8 through the current Shuttle and Skylab missions, approximately 50 % of the crewmembers have experienced instances of <b>space</b> motion <b>sickness.</b> <b>Space</b> motion <b>sickness,</b> renamed <b>space</b> adaptation syndrome, occurs primarily during the initial period of a mission until habilation takes place. One of NASA's efforts to resolve the space adaptation syndrome is to model the individual's vestibular response for basis knowledge and as a possible predictor of an individual's susceptibility to the disorder. This report describes a method to analyse the vestibular system when subjected to a pseudorandom angular velocity input. A sum of sinusoids (pseudorandom) input lends itself to analysis by linear frequency methods. Resultant horizontal ocular movements were digitized, filtered and transformed into the frequency domain. Programs were developed and evaluated to obtain the (1) auto spectra of input stimulus and resultant ocular resonse, (2) cross spectra, (3) the estimated vestibular-ocular system transfer function gain and phase, and (4) coherence function between stimulus and response functions...|$|R

A symptom matrix was analyzed for 19 crewmembers treated with an oral combination of scopolamine and dextroamphetamine (scopdex) and 15 crewmembers treated with promethazine delivered by intramuscular (IM) or suppository routes. Scopdex has been given preflight as prophaxis for <b>Space</b> Motion <b>Sickness</b> but analysis showed delayed symptom presentation in 9 crewmembers or failed to prevent symptoms in 7. Only three crewmembers who took scopdex had no symptoms inflight. Fourteen out of 15 crewmembers treated with IM promethazine and 6 of 8 treated with promethazine suppositories after symptom development had immediate (within 12 h) symptom relief and required no additional medication. There were no cases of delayed symptom presentation in the crewmembers treated with promethazine.

We conclude that promethazine is an effective treatment of <b>Space</b> Motion <b>Sickness</b> symptoms inflight.
