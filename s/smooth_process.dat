5|$|All {{identifiable}} {{fossils of}} Albertosaurus sarcophagus are {{known from the}} upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta. These younger units of this geologic formation date to the early Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, 70 to 68 Ma (million years ago). Immediately below this formation is the Bearpaw Shale, a marine formation representing {{a section of the}} Western Interior Seaway. The seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided {{towards the end of the}} Cretaceous, exposing land that had previously been underwater. It was not a <b>smooth</b> <b>process,</b> however, and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout Horseshoe Canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like lagoons, estuaries and tidal flats. Numerous coal seams represent ancient peat swamps. Like most of the other vertebrate fossils from the formation, Albertosaurus remains are found in deposits laid down in the deltas and floodplains of large rivers during the later half of Horseshoe Canyon times.|$|E
500|$|Stylistically, One Hot Minute diverged {{from the}} Chili Peppers' {{previous}} records—especially Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The album {{was characterized by}} prominent use of heavy metal guitar riffs and hints of psychedelic rock. Navarro, unlike Flea and Kiedis, was not influenced by funk music. He told Guitar World in 1996, [...] "It doesn't really speak to me. But then again, when I'm playing with three other guys who I love and feel camaraderie with, it's enjoyable to play funk." [...] Navarro's own style was influenced mainly by classic rock guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page, as well as gothic rock guitarists Robert Smith and Daniel Ash. Continuing a trend that started on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Kiedis diverged even further away from his signature rapping, only doing so on a few tracks. One Hot Minute took almost two years to write, and its recording and production was not a <b>smooth</b> <b>process.</b> Navarro {{felt as though he}} was an outsider to the other members. His writing in Jane's Addiction was independent from other contributors, whereas the Red Hot Chili Peppers was a far more collaborative group. Navarro himself noted that the band's dynamic was more balanced than that of Jane's Addiction, which was often dominated by frontman Perry Farrell.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Wickenheiser {{became the}} first woman to score a goal playing in a men's {{professional}} league (for HC Salamat in Mestis, Finland's second-division league). Over the course of the season, Wickenheiser played 23 games, scoring 2 goals and adding 10 assists. [...] Wickenheiser joined a European league to play professional hockey, as the game is more open and less physical than North American leagues. [...] This attempt to play professional hockey was not an entirely <b>smooth</b> <b>process,</b> as Wickenheiser was initially slated to play in Italy, until the Italian Winter Sports Federation ruled that women were ineligible to play in a men's league. [...] She also turned down an offer from Phil Esposito to play for the Cincinnati Cyclones of the ECHL. Finland's Hockey Federation unanimously supported letting women play in a men's league, allowing her to debut with HC Salamat in the Suomi-sarja, the third highest hockey league in Finland, on January 10, 2003. [...] Wickenheiser played briefly with Salamat in 2004. They had won promotion to Mestis, Finland's second tier of professional hockey, and this was not as good a fit for her. She left the team after ten games.|$|E

40|$|Standard proofs of the ergodic theorems of {{demography}} rely on theorems {{borrowed from}} positive matrix theory, tauberian theory, {{and the theory}} of time-inhomogeneous Markov matrices. But while these proofs are efficient and expedient, they give little direct insight into the mechanism that causes ergodicity. This paper proposes a simple and unified proof of the two ergodic theorems. It is shown that the birth dynamics can be decomposed into a <b>smoothing</b> <b>process</b> that progressively levels out past fluctuations in the birth sequence and a reshaping process that accounts for current period-to-period changes in vital rates.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Smoothing pseudo ranges with ionosphere-free {{combinations}} of phase ranges {{can be useful}} for long rang positioning, since this new <b>smoothing</b> <b>process</b> can significantly remove the effect of ionosphere delays in positioning applications. The <b>smoothing</b> <b>process</b> can be conducted without being affected by cycle slips, though it uses phase ranges. Therefore, it can provide a robust precise positioning solution which is not affected by cycle slips. The multipath effects may also be reduced, if the averaging interval taken is long enough. If the low frequency noise components and the hardware biases in pseudo ranges are reduced, the positioning performance with the smoothed pseudo ranges may be promising. In future GNSS receivers, both the noises and the hardware biases in pseudo ranges will be significantly reduced. Then, the positioning based on the proposed algorithm will be very useful. 1...|$|R
