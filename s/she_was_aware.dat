5|$|As {{the years}} went by with further childlessness, Ernest became more distant to his wife, and was {{continually}} unfaithful. Though Alexandrine continued to be devoted, choosing to ignore those relationships <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> of, her loyalty became increasingly baffling to those outside her immediate family. By 1859, after seventeen years of childlessness, Ernest took no further interest in his wife.|$|E

This photograph was quickly reproduced on the front pages of newspapers around the world. Mrs. Kennedy testified the following June that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> of the image, but had no memory of her actions. Hill later wrote that this picture would forever identify him as the Secret Service agent {{on the back of the}} limousine.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s Utopia became {{well known}} for the design and {{production}} of batiks. By 1981 there were 50artists at Utopia creating batik works; 88 artists participated in a major design project supported by the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association. Although several sources comment that artistic activity at Utopia began with batik and only later moved to painting, they do not state whether or not Minnie was a textile artist before she took up the brush. The National Gallery of Victoria's brief biography suggests {{that she did not}} participate in the making of batik, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> of it.|$|E

5|$|The {{family was}} arrested and imprisoned, first in their home at Tsarskoye Selo and later at residences in Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg in Siberia. Maria {{attempted}} to befriend her guards both at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk and soon learned their names and details about their wives and children. Unaware of her danger, she commented at Tobolsk {{that she would be}} happy to live there indefinitely if only she could take a walk outside without being guarded continuously. Still, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> that she was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned their letters and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would be searched.|$|E

While she was not active in obtaining information for Germany, she helped Duquesne prepare material for transmittal abroad. Upon a guilty plea, Lewis was sentenced to serve one year and one day in prison for violation of the Registration Act.|$|E

In 1956, after Look Back in Anger had opened, Osborne met her at the railway station in York, at which meeting she told Osborne of her recent {{abortion}} and enquired after his relationship with Mary Ure, of which <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware.</b> In April 1957, Osborne was granted a divorce from Lane, on the grounds of his adultery.|$|E

25|$|A second son, Henry Charles Albert David, {{was born}} on 15 September 1984. The Princess {{asserted}} she and the Prince were closest during her pregnancy with Harry (as the younger prince has always been known). <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> their second child was a boy, but did not share the knowledge with anyone else, including the Prince of Wales. Suggestions that Harry's father is not Charles but James Hewitt, with whom Diana had an affair, are based on alleged physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry; however, Harry was born before the affair began.|$|E
25|$|Behn was immensely prolific, writing plays, {{fiction and}} poetry, and {{translating}} works from French. She caused scandal {{in some of}} her chosen subject matter, often alluding to sexual desire. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware,</b> and stated that, the works would not have caused problems {{if they had been}} written by a man. Behn's work frequently takes homoerotic themes, featuring same-sex love between women. One of her best-known poems, The Disappointment, {{is the story of a}} sexual encounter told from a woman's point of view that may be interpreted as a work about male impotence.|$|E

25|$|Giorgione died, {{probably}} of {{the plague}} then raging, by October, 1510. He was usually {{thought to have}} died and been buried {{on the island of}} Poveglia in the Ventetian lagoon, but an archive document published {{for the first time in}} 2011 places his death on the island of Lazzareto Nuovo; both were used as places of quarantine in times of plague. October 1510 is also the date of a letter by Isabella d'Este to a Venetian friend; asking him to buy a painting by Giorgione; the letter shows <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> he was already dead. Significantly, the reply a month later said the painting was not to be had at any price.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Elizabeth Bartlett {{placed her}} own {{creative}} {{work to the}} side to begin a project that was to occupy her for the last dozen years of her life. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> that the summer Olympics was scheduled {{to take place in}} Los Angeles the following year. The Olympic Games in ancient Greece had honored outstanding athletes, but also recognized poets for excellence of mind and literary talent. Bartlett therefore founded Literary Olympics to bring the cultural component back into the Olympics. She directed the work of internationally distinguished associate editors located in Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, East, North, and West Europe, Great Britain, Latin America, and the United States. The international organization was granted status as a non-profit corporation under IRS Code 501(c)(3) in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Family, or lack thereof, remains {{important}} throughout both Hilde's {{childhood and}} adulthood. Hilde's childhood is laden with abuse and patriarchal superiority. This {{is represented by}} her father's harmful actions and her mother's unwillingness to ask her brothers to do housework. In the ideal fascist society the family unit mimicked the hierarchical structure of the state. In Hilde's case, the state was stronger and more stable than her own family unit. This is evident at {{the climax of the}} novel, when she is having an inner struggle about choosing to do what was right by Germany's standards or by Hannes' standards. In the end she chose Germany's — her family life was too weak and dysfunctional {{to stand up to the}} beliefs instilled by the state and the only morals <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> of were state-taught.|$|E

25|$|Jatin {{was born}} to Sharatshashi and Umeshchandra Mukherjee in Kayagram, a village in the Kushtia {{subdivision}} of Nadia district {{in what is now}} Bangladesh. He grew up in his ancestral home at Sadhuhati, P.S. Rishkhali Jhenaidah until his father's death when Jatin was five years old. Well versed in Brahmanic studies, his father liked horses and was respected for the strength of his character. Sharatshashi settled in her parents' home in Kayagram with her husband and his elder sister Benodebala (or Vinodebala). A gifted poet, she was affectionate and stern in her method of raising her children. Familiar with the essays by contemporary thought leaders like Bankimchandra Chatterjee and Yogendra Vidyabhushan, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> of the social and political transformations of her times. Her brother Basanta Kumar Chattopadhyay (father of Indian revolutionary and politician Haripada Chattopadhyay) taught and practised law, and counted among his clients the poet Rabindranath Tagore. Since the age of 14, Tagore had claimed in meetings organised by his family members equal rights for Indian citizens inside railway carriages and in public places. As Jatin grew older, he gained a reputation for physical bravery and great strength; charitable and cheerful by nature, he was fond of caricature and enacting mythological plays, himself playing the roles of god-loving characters like Prahlad, Dhruva, Hanuman, Râja Harish Chandra. He not only encouraged several playwrights to produce patriotic pieces for the urban stage, but also engaged village bards to spread nationalist fervour in the countryside. Jatin had a natural respect for the human creature, heedless of class or caste or religions. He carried for an aged Muslim villager a heavy bundle of fodder and, on reaching her hut, he shared with her the only platter of rice she had, and sent her some money every month.|$|E

The court further heard that Lamb of God had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue, including that barriers should be placed [...] from the stage.

She wrote: [...] "he is such an enthusiast that he makes things as he imagines they ought to be; and not as they are really found...". A few years later there was a public scandal when {{it was discovered that}} Hawkins had inserted fake bones to make some ichthyosaur skeletons seem more complete, and later sold them to the government for the British Museum's collection without the appraisers knowing about the additions.|$|E
500|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> {{from the}} outset that her {{circumstances}} would make her vulnerable to [...] "ladies who lunch"-style remarks (sometimes made against women, married to wealthy, high-profile men, who engage in charitable activities), but said, [...] "People who criticise these women are probably giving into cynicism, and I think if you get cynical about life, you lose the real meaning of it." [...] In 2007, she {{became a member of}} the board of directors for Chernobyl Children's Project International, a role that would give her a voice in the organisation's policy making.

Chris Carter said that Fowley [...] "was a character you were destined to hate because she was a competitor for Mulder's affection with Scully.
