It also found that the hasty evacuation was unnecessary. Based on the report, the Health Care Financing Administration fined the HHC $3,050 per day for every day the former residents remained in sub-par housing, totaling $450,000. In December 1998, a portion of the complex, the Neponsit Adult Day Health Care which provided outpatient physical therapy, was relocated to the gymnasium of the Young Israel of Far Rockaway synagogue in Far Rockaway. A second court ruling on October 29, 1999, stated that the HHC overextended its authority when evacuating the facility, and blocked demolition. Despite this, the Giuliani administration continued to try and demolitish the building.

40|$|In recent years, cracks {{have been}} {{detected}} in piping systems of nuclear power plants. Many of them are multiple cracks in the same welded joints. Therefore, <b>structural</b> integrity <b>evaluation</b> and risk assessment considering multiple cracks and crack initiation in aged piping have become increasingly important. Probabilistic fracture mechanics (PFM) is a rational methodology in <b>structural</b> integrity <b>evaluation</b> and risk assessment of aged piping in nuclear power plants. Two PFM codes, PASCAL-SP and PRAISE-JNES, have been improved or developed in Japan for the <b>structural</b> integrity <b>evaluation</b> and risk assessment considering the age related degradation mechanisms of pipes.
