40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{describe}} VocaWatcher, a novel robot motion generator that enables a humanoid robot {{to sing with}} realistic facial expressions and naturally synthesized <b>singing</b> <b>voices.</b> This robot singer is an important and attractive humanoid robot application for the entertainment scene; moreover, it promotes state-of-the-art integration of robot engineering, music processing, and image processing. To overcome the difficulties of generating natural facial expressions that are precisely synchronized with <b>singing</b> <b>voices,</b> VocaWatcher imitates a human singer by analyzing a video clip of a human singing, recorded by a single video camera. VocaWatcher can control mouth, eye, and neck motions by imitating the corresponding human movements, which are estimated without using any markers in the video. It can also synthesize <b>singing</b> <b>voices</b> by imitating the pitch and dynamics of the human singing in the same video. I...|$|R
