5000|$|Squalene is {{traditionally}} sourced from the livers of sharks. Approximately 3000 sharks {{are required to}} produce one ton of <b>squalane.</b> At an estimated annual global use for cosmetics of about 2000 tons (2016), this would mean millions of sharks {{would be required to}} satisfy global demand. Due to environmental concerns, olive oil and sugarcane as non-animal sources have been developed and commercialized. Other plant sources yielding commercial supply are sunflower [...] and rice, although the latter source only gives mediocre purity (75%). In a biotechnological process, farnesene is produced from fermentation of sugarcane sugars using genetically modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains.

40|$|We report our single-molecule {{fluorescence}} microscopy and {{molecular dynamics simulation}} studies on the interaction of poly(amidoamine) dendrimer and <b>squalane</b> hydrocarbon in aqueous solution.

40|$|The inelastic {{scattering}} of gas-phase OH radicals from a liquid hydrocarbon and a liquid perfluorinated polyether (PFPE) has been investigated. The surfaces examined were the potentially reactive, branched hydrocarbon <b>squalane</b> (CH, 2, 6, 10, 15, 19, 23 -hexamethyltetracosane) and the inert PFPE Krytox 1506 (F-[CF(CF) -CFO] -CFCF). Superthermal OH {{was formed by}} 355 -nm laser photolysis of a low pressure of HONO above the liquid surface. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) {{was used to determine}} the relative yields and nascent translational and rotational distributions of OH (v′ = 0). The time-of-flight profiles from both liquids can be resolved, at least empirically, into two components. The dominant, faster component is consistent with direct, {{inelastic scattering}}. It has a higher average translational energy from PFPE than from <b>squalane.</b> This faster OH also has a higher Boltzmann-like rotational temperature for PFPE (655 ± 45 K) than for <b>squalane</b> (473 ± 27 K), in both cases considerably hotter than the incoming OH. For both liquids, there is also a slower component, with characteristics consistent with a thermalized, trapping-desorption mechanism. This is a higher proportion for <b>squalane</b> (0. 22 ± 0. 02) than for PFPE (0. 09 ± 0. 01). These results are consistent with <b>squalane</b> being the "softer" surface, exhibiting more efficient momentum transfer than PFPE, and more able to temporarily trap OH. Relative to PFPE, around half (0. 49 ± 0. 04) of the OH molecules that collide with <b>squalane</b> are lost, presumably due to reaction forming HO. These results are compared with previous studies of the scattering of inert gas species from both <b>squalane</b> and PFPE. The reactive branching fraction of OH on <b>squalane</b> is discussed in the context of previous observations of enhanced reactivity at the gas-liquid interface. © 2008 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|DOI: 10. 1063 / 1. 2464091 The {{structure}} of a monolayer film of the branched alkane <b>squalane</b> (C 30 H 62) adsorbed on graphite has been studied by neutron diffraction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and compared with a similar study of the n-alkane tetracosane (n-C 24 H 52). Both molecules have 24 carbon atoms along their backbone and <b>squalane</b> has, in addition, six methyl side groups. Upon adsorption, there are significant differences as well as similarities {{in the behavior of}} these molecular films. Both molecules form ordered structures at low temperatures; however, while the melting point of the two-dimensional (2 D) tetracosane film is roughly the same as the bulk melting point, the surface strongly stabilizes the 2 D <b>squalane</b> film such that its melting point is 91  K above its value in bulk. Therefore, <b>squalane,</b> like tetracosane, will be a poor lubricant in those nanoscale devices that require a fluid lubricant at room temperature. The neutron diffraction data show that the translational order in the <b>squalane</b> monolayer is significantly less than in the tetracosane monolayer. The authors' MD simulations suggest that this is caused by a distortion of the <b>squalane</b> molecules upon adsorption on the graphite surface. When the molecules are allowed to relax on the surface, they distort such that all six methyl groups point away from the surface. This results in a reduction in the monolayer's translational order characterized by a decrease in its coherence length and hence a broadening of the diffraction peaks. The MD simulations also show that the melting mechanism in the <b>squalane</b> monolayer is the same footprint reduction mechanism found in the tetracosane monolayer, where a chain melting drives the lattice melting.

40|$|The {{temperature}} dependency of {{the retention}} behaviour of some alkanes with <b>squalane</b> as stationary phase has been measured {{at a very}} high precision level, at temperatures from 30 to 90 °C. Besides the retention index itself [1], its temperature dependency appears {{to be a source of}} information about structure. By comparing the retention indices on <b>squalane</b> and on octadecene- 1 at 50 °C it is seen that indices of all branched alkanes have higher values on the former. Retention indices of the same alkanes on nC 28, nC 32, nC 36 and on <b>squalane</b> as stationary phases, calculated from published specific retention volumes [7] also show the tendency of increasing index with increasing methyl content of the stationary phase.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the by Gainaru et al. [2013] newly discovered low frequency mechanical crossover observed in monohydroxy alcohols by diluting neat 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol (2 E 1 H) with <b>squalane.</b> The complex shear modulus is being measured using a PSG transducer, developed by Christensen and Olsen [1995] at Roskilde University, that allows measurements with frequencies ranging from 10 ^(- 3) - 10 ^ 6 Hz. From the assumption that monohydroxy alcohols {{can be described as}} shortchain polymers, a model proposed by Bo Jakobsen based on an addition of the Maxwell and the Rouse model from Gray et al. [1977] is being investigated and compared to existing mechanical data of 2 E 1 H. The model is fitted to data for the monohydroxy alcohol 2 E 1 H obtained from Gainaru et al. [2013], indicating that monohydroxy alcohols may be described as short-chain polymers. The three investigated properties of the liquids are low frequency crossovers, the broadness of the alpha-peaks, and the low frequency viscosities. It is concluded that the experimental equipment at NSM Roskilde University needs to be optimized with a wider shear modulus and frequency measuring range, to be able to observe crossovers in solutions of 2 E 1 H and <b>squalane.</b> The broadest alpha-peak is observed for 0. 353 mole fraction <b>squalane</b> in 2 E 1 H, indicating a hindering in the forming of H-bonds at relatively low concentrations of <b>squalane.</b> An extra contribution to the viscosity is observed for both liquids and intermediate solutions. By comparing data of solutions of 2 E 1 H and <b>squalane</b> with experimental data from the Glass & Time data repository, it is suggested that a broad alpha-peak and an extra viscosity contribution are generic for monohydroxy alcohols and possibly also polymers of low molecular weight. Similar properties are observed for liquid <b>squalane,</b> which in addition shows a strong temperature dependence, comparable to the structurally similar polymer polybutadiene (PB 20) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe new {{quantitative}} approach to elastohydrodynamic lubrication requires {{a description of}} the steady shear dependent viscosity for calculations of film thickness and friction. This property can be obtained from measurements in pressurized thin-film Couette viscometers. However, frequency dependent viscosity can be obtained from a torsionally vibrating quartz crystal viscometer at high pressure or a relatively simple ambient pressure measurement with a shear impedance spectrometer. Here it is shown for <b>squalane</b> and for a cyclic hydrocarbon and for a diester that both the steady shear dependent viscosity and the frequency dependent viscosity obey time-temperature-pressure superposition with the simplest shifting rule over the range of conditions investigated. Flow curves shift along a constant steady stress path or a constant complex modulus path. The Cox-Merz rule has been confirmed only for <b>squalane</b> and then only near the transition. The EHL friction for <b>squalane</b> at low pressure may be predicted with fair accuracy from the frequency dependent viscosity measured at ambient pressure.

40|$|The {{heterogeneous}} reaction of OH radicals with sub-micron <b>squalane</b> particles, {{in the presence}} of O 2, is used as a model system to explore the fundamental chemical mechanisms that control the oxidative aging of organic aerosols in the atmosphere. Detailed kinetic measurements combined with elemental mass spectrometric analysis reveal that the reaction proceeds sequentially by adding an average of one oxygenated functional group per reactive loss of <b>squalane.</b> The reactive uptake coefficient of OH with <b>squalane</b> particles is determined to be 0. 3 ± 0. 07 at an average OH concentration of ~ 1 × 10 10 molecules cm − 3. Based on a comparison between the measured particle mass and model predictions it appears that significant volatilization of a reduced organic particle would be extremely slow in the real atmosphere.

The quantum yield of 4, 4 ′-DCB photodecay in Tween 80 micellar solution in the presence of added acetone was increased from 0. 032 to 0. 043 at its optimal condition.

This represents the first systematic investigation of reactions of this type for molecules other than <b>squalane.</b> The O(3 P) atoms were generated by 355 -nm laser photolysis of a low pressure of NO 2 above the liquid surface. The nascent gas-phase OH radical products were detected by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). Measurements for the linear hydrocarbons were constrained by their vapor pressures to single temperatures slightly (∼ 1 K) above their respective melting points. Pristane was studied at the lowest temperature practically achievable. <b>Squalane</b> was compared as a reference at the full set of temperatures. Appearance profiles {{for all of the}} liquids showed similar characteristic differences between OH v′= 0 and 1. LIF excitation spectra were obtained for each of the vibrational levels at both the rising edge and peak of the appearance profiles. We conclude that the observed variations in rotational temperatures are consistent with dual contributions to the reaction mechanism for all the liquids, involving both direct escape and trapping-desorption components of the observed OH, as has previously been proposed for <b>squalane.</b> The relative yields of OH showed some surprising dependences on the liquid, including an unexpectedly strong variation with linear hydrocarbon chain length.

A kinetic model of multigenerational chemistry, which is compared to previously measured (<b>squalane)</b> and new (BES) experimental data, reveals {{that it is the}} statistical mixtures of different generations of oxidation products that control the average particle mass and elemental composition during the reaction. The model suggests that more highly oxidized reaction products, although initially formed with low probability, play a large role in the production of gas phase reaction products. In general, these results highlight the importance of considering atmospheric oxidation as a statistical process, further suggesting that the underlying distribution of molecules could play important roles in aerosol formation {{as well as in the}} evolution of key physicochemical properties such as volatility and hygroscopicity...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSqualane {{is being}} {{recommended}} as a secondary reference material for viscometry at moderate to high pressure and at moderate viscosity. As {{part of this}} work, a correlation has been developed for atmospheric pressure (Comuñas et al., 2013) [12]. Here we report new experimental high pressure viscosities for <b>squalane</b> (176 data points obtained for temperatures (293. 15 to 363. 15) K, at pressures up to 350 MPa with a maximum viscosity of 745 mPa * s). These have been determined with four different falling-body viscometers {{as well as a}} quartz crystal resonator viscometer. A preliminary high pressure viscosity correlation for <b>squalane</b> is proposed, based on our new data. At pressures up to 350 MPa, this correlation provides an absolute average deviation of 1. 5 % with a maximum absolute deviation of 8. 9 %. Comparison is made between the different instruments.

40|$|The {{isomerization}} {{products of}} n-C 8 [...] -C 10 a,¿-alkadienes were separated on a high-efficiency <b>squalane</b> column (195 m × 0. 25 mm I. D.) with 500, 000 effective plates. Of the 102 possible n-C 8 [...] -C 10 dienes with isolated and conjugated double bonds, only nine groups of isomers were not separated. All isomers, except those with cumulated double bonds, were identified (23 octadienes, 33 nonadienes and 46 decadienes). The n-octadienes {{were identified by}} matching measured and published retention data. Because {{of the lack of}} standards, retention data and mass spectra of n-nona- and decadienes, and because the previously reported identification method for n-dienes up to C 8 was succesful, the problem of the identification of C 9 [...] -C 10 n-alkadienes was solved similarly by using structure-retention correlations and combined capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Based on these results, the retention behaviour of the conjugated and isolated n-alkadienes, on <b>squalane</b> stationary phase, is generalized...|$|E
40|$|The inelastic {{scattering}} of OH radicals from {{the surfaces of}} a sequence of potentially reactive organic liquids: <b>squalane</b> (C 30 H 62, 2, 6, 10, 15, 19, 23 -hexamethyltetracosane); squalene (C 30 H 50, trans- 2, 6, 10, 15, 19, 23 -hexamethyltetracosa- 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 -hexaene); and oleic acid (C 18 H 34 O 2, cis- 9 -octadecanoic acid) was studied experimentally. A liquid long-chain perfluorinated polyether (PFPE, Krytox® 1506) was compared as a chemically inert reference. Gas-phase OH with an average laboratory-frame kinetic energy of 54 kJ mol- 1 was generated by 355 -nm photolysis of a low-pressure of HONO a short distance (9 mm) above the liquid surface. Scattered OH was detected at the same distance by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). Appearance profiles {{as a function of}} photolysis-probe delay were recorded for selected OH v′ = 0, N′ rotational levels. The efficiency of momentum transfer to the surface is least for PFPE and highest for <b>squalane,</b> with squalene and oleic acid intermediate, but in all cases the speed distributions are markedly too hot to be consistent with a thermal accommodation mechanism. The rotational distribution is found to be a function of scattered OH speed. The generally high rotational temperatures implied by the relative fluxes for N′ = 1 and 5 were confirmed by LIF excitation spectra {{at the peak of the}} profile for each liquid. The trends in translational-to-rotational energy transfer were broadly consistent with the sequence in surface stiffness inferred from the translational inelasticity. The non-statistical distribution of OH fine-structure and Λ-doublet states produced by HONO photolysis appears to be effectively completely scrambled in collisions with the liquid surfaces. With due account taken of the product rotational distributions, and assuming that 100 % of the OH scatters from PFPE, the integrated OH survival probabilities were: <b>squalane</b> (0. 70 ± 0. 08), squalene (0. 61 ± 0. 07) and oleic acid (0. 76 ± 0. 10). The 'missing' OH is presumed to have reacted at the liquid surface. Detailed comparison of the appearance profiles suggests that the main difference between <b>squalane</b> and squalene is loss of slower-moving OH, consistent with an additional capture mechanism at the vinyl sites. © 2011 the Owner Societies...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{reflectivity}} is used {{to study}} the interfacial structure of liquid <b>squalane</b> on SiO 2 /Si(1 0 0) substrates. The data show that there are density oscillations (ÔlayersÕ) near the interface, with the <b>squalane</b> molecular long axes parallel to the substrate. The results are compared to those from molecular dynamics simulations and recent force measurements. Ó 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Liquids near solid surfaces play essential roles in lubrication, coating, adhesion, wetting, chemical and biological processes, etc. Many experiments {{have suggested that the}} structure and properties of liquids near interfaces are {{different from that of the}} same liquid in the bulk. For example, surface force measurements of liquids between two smooth solid surfaces find that there are oscillations in the force acting between the solid surfaces as a function of the distance between the two surfaces [1 – 3]. X-ray scattering studies of liquid metals at free interfaces [4, 5], and of spherical-molecule liquids near solid–liquid interfaces [6, 7],show that these liquids form layered structures near single surfaces/interfaces. The interfacial structure of liquid branched alkanes at solid interfaces has been a subject of numerous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations [8 – 11]. These simulations predict that branched alkanes, when confined between two solid surfaces, form layered structures in which the density oscillates as a function of the distance from the solid interface, though the density oscillations are not as pronounced as those in linear alkane systems [8, 9]. However, the experimental situation is less clear. Early surface force apparatus (SFA) measurements were interpreted to indicate that the side chains in <b>squalane</b> disrupt molecular layering, resulting in a monotonic force–distance curves [12, 13].
