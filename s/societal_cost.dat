K., Tokyo, Japan; 2 Düsseldorf Institute for Competition Economics (DICE), University of Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany Background: No {{study has}} {{examined}} the financial impact of relapses on schizophrenia {{from the perspective of}} Japanese society. This study aimed to estimate the <b>societal</b> <b>costs</b> in Japan caused by the relapses of schizophrenia. Methods: The <b>societal</b> <b>costs</b> in Japan in 2013 due to relapses of schizophrenia were estimated by summing the productivity loss and deadweight loss caused by schizophrenia relapses in 2013. Deterministic sensitivity analysis was conducted for deadweight loss rate, relapse rate, and patient income. Results: Japan incurred JPY 55, 039 million <b>societal</b> <b>costs</b> because of relapses in 2013. This consists of JPY 3, 990 million for productivity loss and JPY 51, 049 million for deadweight loss. Rate of deadweight loss is the most significant cost driver in the sensitivity analysis. Conclusion: Relapses of schizophrenia could generate huge amount of <b>societal</b> <b>costs</b> by reducing labor productivity and economic efficiency. To curb these costs, relapse prevention is desired in treating schizophrenia. Keywords: schizophrenia, relapses, <b>societal</b> <b>costs,</b> productivity loss, deadweight loss, Japan ...|$|R

40|$|Background Previous {{assessments}} of {{the economic impact of}} preterm birth focussed on short term health service costs across the broad spectrum of prematurity. Objective To estimate the <b>societal</b> <b>costs</b> of extreme preterm birth during the sixth year after birth.

5000|$|Peters and Kramer {{observed}} that [...] "...little {{research has been}} done to quantify the impact of toll collection on society as a whole..." [...] and therefore they published a comprehensive analysis of the Total <b>Societal</b> <b>Cost</b> (TSC) associated with toll collection as a means of taxation. TSC is the sum of administrative, compliance, fuel and pollution costs. In 2000 they estimated it to be $56,914,732, or 37.3% of revenue collected. They also found that a user of a toll road is subject to a form of triple taxation, and that in the final analysis toll collection is a very inefficient means of funding the development of highway infrastructure. Nakamura and Kockelman (2002) show that tolls are by nature regressive, shifting the burden of taxation disproportionately to the poor and middle classes.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Smoking {{affects the}} course of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease [IBD]. We aimed to study the impact of smoking on IBD-specific costs and health-related quality-of-life [HrQoL] among adults with Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]. Methods: A large cohort of IBD patients was prospectively followed during 1 year using 3 -monthly questionnaires on smoking status, health resources, disease activity and HrQoL. Costs were calculated by multiplying used resources with corresponding unit prices. Healthcare costs, patient costs, productivity losses, disease course items and HrQoL were compared between smokers, never-smokers and ex-smokers, adjusted for potential confounders. Results: In total, 3030 patients [1558 CD, 1054 UC, 418 IBD-unknown] were enrolled; 16 % smoked at baseline. In CD, disease course was more severe among smokers. Smoking was associated with > 30 % higher annual <b>societal</b> <b>costs</b> in IBD (€ 7, 905 [95 % confidence interval € 6, 234 - € 9, 864] vs € 6, 017 [€ 5, 186 - € 6, 946] in never-smokers and € 5, 710 [€ 4, 687 - € 6, 878] in ex-smokers, p = 0. 06 and p = 0. 04, respectively). In CD, smoking patients generated the highest <b>societal</b> <b>costs,</b> primarily driven {{by the use of}} anti-tumour necrosis factor compounds. In UC, <b>societal</b> <b>costs</b> of smoking patients were comparable to those of non-smokers. <b>Societal</b> <b>costs</b> of IBD patients who quitted smoking > 5 years before inclusion were lower than in patients who quitted within the past 5 years (€ 5, 135 [95 % CI € 4, 122 - € 6, 303] vs € 9, 342 [€ 6, 010 - € 12, 788], p = 0. 01). In both CD and UC, smoking was associated with a lower HrQoL. Conclusions: Smoking is associated with higher <b>societal</b> <b>costs</b> and lower HrQoL in IBD patients.

Thus, the role of regulators primarily involves providing technical input into the development of EE policies initiated by other agencies or via legislated tax programs. [...] In addition, the Regulator must determine (unless specified in law) which benefit-cost test is appropriate for evaluating utility-based EE programs. The regulatory tests include the participant cost test (will participants benefit over the measure's life?), the program administrator cost test (will utility bills increase?), the ratepayer impact measure (will utility prices increase?), the total resource cost test (will the total costs of energy decrease?) and the <b>societal</b> <b>cost</b> test (is the utility, state or nation better off, including environmental impacts?).

The triple bottom line adds two more [...] "bottom lines”: social and environmental (ecological) concerns. With the ratification of the United Nations and ICLEI TBL standard for urban and community accounting in early 2007, this became the dominant approach to public sector full cost accounting. Similar UN standards apply to natural capital and human capital measurement to assist in measurements required by TBL, e.g. the EcoBudget standard for reporting ecological footprint.

40|$|Primary {{infection}} of Toxoplasma gondii during pregnancy {{can be transmitted}} to the unborn child and may have serious consequences, including retinochoroiditis, hydrocephaly, cerebral calcifications, encephalitis, splenomegaly, hearing loss, blindness, and death. Austria, a country with moderate seroprevalence, instituted mandatory prenatal screening for toxoplasma infection to minimize the effects of congenital transmission. This work compares the <b>societal</b> <b>costs</b> of congenital toxoplasmosis under the Austrian national prenatal screening program with the <b>societal</b> <b>costs</b> that would have occurred in a No-Screening scenario. We retrospectively investigated data from the Austrian Toxoplasmosis Register for birth cohorts from 1992 to 2008, including pediatric long-term follow-up until May 2013. We constructed a decision-analytic model to compare lifetime <b>societal</b> <b>costs</b> of prenatal screening with lifetime <b>societal</b> <b>costs</b> estimated in a No-Screening scenario. We included costs of treatment, lifetime care, accommodation of injuries, loss of life, and lost earnings that would have occurred in a No-Screening scenario and compared them with the actual costs of screening, treatment, lifetime care, accommodation, loss of life, and lost earnings. We replicated that analysis excluding loss of life and lost earnings to estimate the budgetary impact alone. Our model calculated total lifetime costs of € 103 per birth under prenatal screening as carried out in Austria, saving € 323 per birth compared with No-Screening. Without screening and treatment, lifetime <b>societal</b> <b>costs</b> for all affected children would have been € 35 million per year; the implementation costs of the Austrian program are less than € 2 million per year. Calculating only the budgetary impact, the national program was still cost-saving by more than € 15 million per year and saved € 258 million in 17 years. Cost savings under a national program of prenatal screening for toxoplasma infection and treatment are outstanding.

Vitality (here defined as energy, motivation and resilience) is an often used concept, which also aims at someone’s capabilities. However, {{little is known about}} vitality yet; in particular about its association with participation and <b>societal</b> <b>costs.</b> Methods: Within a cross-sectional design, information regarding vitality, participation and <b>societal</b> <b>costs</b> was collected among 8015 Dutch adults aged 20 years and over.
