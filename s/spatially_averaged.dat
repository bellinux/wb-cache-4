50|$|Computer Aided Inspection (CAI) {{is a new}} {{technology}} that enables one to develop a comparison of a physical part to a 3D CAD model. This process is faster, more complete, and more accurate than using a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) or other more traditional methods. An automatic inspection method and apparatus using structured light and machine vision camera is used to inspect an object {{in conjunction with the}} geometric model of the object. Camera images of the object are analyzed by computer to produce the location of points on the object's surfaces in three dimensions. Point-cloud data is taken from a laser scanner or other 3-D scanning device. During a setup phase before object inspection, the points are analyzed with respect to the geometric model of the object. The software provides a graphical comparison of the manufactured part compared to the CAD model. Many points are eliminated to reduce data-taking and analysis time to a minimum and prevent extraneous reflections from producing errors. When similar objects are subsequently inspected, points from each surface of interest are <b>spatially</b> <b>averaged</b> to give high accuracy measurements of object dimensions. The inspection device uses several multiplexed sensors, each composed of a camera and a structured light source, to measure all sides of the object in a single pass.|$|E

40|$|General {{circulation}} models (GCMs), or stand-alone {{models that}} are {{forced by the}} output from GCMs, are increasingly being used to simulate the interactions between snow cover, snowmelt, climate and water resources. The variation in snowpack extent, and hence albedo, through time in a cell {{is likely to be}} substantial, especially in mid-latitude mountainous regions. As a consequence, the energy budget simulation by a GCM relies on a realistic representation of snowpack extent. Similarly, from a water resource perspective, the spatial extent of the pack is key in predicting meltwater discharges into rivers. In this paper a simple computationally efficient regional snow model has been developed, which is based on a degree-day approach and simulates the fraction of the model domain covered by snow, the <b>spatially</b> <b>averaged</b> melt rate and the mean snowpack depth. Computational efficiency is achieved through a novel spatial averaging procedure, which relies on the assumptions that precipitation and temperature scale linearly with elevation and that the distribution of elevations in the domain can be modelled by a continuous function. The resulting <b>spatially</b> <b>averaged</b> model is compared with both observations of the duration of snow cover throughout Austria and with results from a distributed model based on the same underlying assumptions but applied at a fine spatial resolution. The new <b>spatially</b> <b>averaged</b> model successfully simulated the seasonal snow duration observations and reproduced the daily dynamics of snow cover extent, the <b>spatially</b> <b>averaged</b> melt rate and mean pack depth simulated by the distributed model.

We propose that whereas it is justified to use the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) line element (which describes an exactly homogeneous and isotropic universe) as a template to construct luminosity distances in order to compare observations with theory, {{the evolution of the}} scale factor in such a construction must be governed not by the standard Einstein equations for the FLRW metric, but by the modified Friedmann equations derived by Buchert [7, 8] in the context of spatial averaging in Cosmology. Furthermore, we argue that this scale factor, defined in the <b>spatially</b> <b>averaged</b> cosmology, will correspond to the effective FLRW metric provided the size of the averaging domain coincides with the scale at which cosmological homogeneity arises. This allows us, in principle, to compare predictions of a <b>spatially</b> <b>averaged</b> cosmology with observations, in the standard manner, for instance by computing the luminosity distance versus red-shift relation. The predictions of the <b>spatially</b> <b>averaged</b> cosmology would in general differ from standard FLRW cosmology, because the scale-factor now obeys the modified FLRW equations.
