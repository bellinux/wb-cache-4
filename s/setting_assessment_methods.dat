The purpose of the assessment is to aid local government {{in their efforts to}} organize, prioritize, and manage wetland resources in a comprehensive manner. The assessment gathers initial information on the area’s wetlands, evaluates a limited number of regionally and locally important wetland functions, and estimates the value of wetland functions. As other more detailed data <b>sets,</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>methods,</b> or site work confirm or refute the method’s outcome, changes will be made to the model to incorporate the new information. This information will be used to enhance the region's environmental and economic sustainability by identifying high functioning, high value wetland communities and developing strategies in the county’s comprehensive landuse plan and water management plan to preserve and manage them...|$|R

30|$|At {{the present}} stage of development, {{financial}} institutions engaged in poverty alleviation have not developed financial evaluation model {{based on the}} special needs of poverty alleviation; instead, they just applied their traditional assessment models which are basically designed to serve those classes with assets lacking of liquidity. It is natural that these <b>assessment</b> <b>methods</b> would lead to deviation from the original goal of poverty alleviation finance. In the traditional financial assessment framework, the definition of “poor” itself means that the people are in difficult financial position and hence they do not meet the requirements of the existing <b>assessment</b> <b>methods.</b> Poverty alleviation finance requires that we change our idea of wealth. We should assess the “poor” using other set of evaluation concepts, which requires that a new <b>set</b> of risk <b>assessment</b> <b>methods</b> based on the future be established. In other words, only to look at the future of existing “poor” can we assess whether they meet the criteria for financial support or not. In terms of credit value assessment, existing financial institutions lay their cornerstone on current situation rather than on the future, so that the poor people are excluded from the financial market. To improve the situation, a new <b>set</b> of risk <b>assessment</b> models based on the future value is needed.|$|R

This collection contains approximately 1. 95 million pages in Finnish and Swedish. Finnish {{part of the}} collection consists of about 2. 40 billion words. The National Library's Digital Collections are offered via the digi. kansalliskirjasto. fi web service, also known as Digi. Part of the newspaper material (from 1771 to 1874) is also available freely downloadable in The Language Bank of Finland provided by the FINCLARIN consortium. The collection can also be accessed through the Korp environment that has been developed by Språkbanken at the University of Gothenburg and extended by FINCLARIN team at the University of Helsinki to provide concordances of text resources. A Cranfield style information retrieval test collection has also been produced out of {{a small part of}} the Digi newspaper material at the University of Tampere. Quality of OCRed collections is an important topic in digital humanities, as it affects general usability and searchability of collections. There is no single available method to assess quality of large collections, but different methods can be used to approximate quality. This paper discusses different corpus analysis style methods to approximate overall lexical quality of the Finnish part of the Digi collection. Methods include usage of parallel samples and word error rates, usage of morphological analyzers, frequency analysis of words and comparisons to comparable edited lexical data. Our aim in the quality analysis is twofold: firstly to analyze the present state of the lexical data and secondly, to establish a <b>set</b> of <b>assessment</b> <b>methods</b> that build up a compact procedure for quality assessment after e. g. new OCRing or post correction of the material.

Using the Consensus-based Standards for selection of health Measurement Instrument (COSMIN) checklist for evaluating the methodological quality of the identified studies, all included studies were rated "fair" or "poor. " Most studies were using BS, and for BS the reliability {{most of the studies}} showed limited positive to conflicting evidence, with some shortcomings on studies for the validity. The three other test <b>assessment</b> <b>methods</b> lack satisfactory information on both reliability and validity. For the questionnaire <b>assessment</b> <b>methods,</b> 5 PQ was the most frequently used, and reliability showed conflicting evidence, while the validity had limited positive to conflicting evidence compared with test <b>assessment</b> <b>methods.</b> For BS-self, the validity showed unknown evidence compared with test <b>assessment</b> <b>methods.</b> In conclusion, following recommended uniformity of testing procedures, the recommendation for clinical use in adults is BS with cut-point of 5 of 9 including historical information, while in children it is BS with cut-point of at least 6 of 9.

40|$|AbstractThe {{changes taking}} place in {{measurement}} and assessment require using of <b>assessment</b> <b>methods</b> which can gain more clues about students’ learning, at the same time inform them about their shortcomings and eliminate those shortcomings. While summative <b>assessment</b> <b>methods</b> enable giving grades reflecting students’ performance, formative <b>assessment</b> <b>methods</b> give feedback to students and help them develop their learning. In parallel with such a change in measurement and <b>assessment,</b> alternative <b>assessment</b> <b>methods</b> are being used in addition to the traditional ones. The most important key to formative <b>assessment</b> <b>method,</b> which follows student learning and helps to meet their needs, is the open and detailed feedback itself. Formative and summative <b>assessment</b> <b>methods,</b> when used together, constitute complementary, meaningful and effective assessment practices. Educators prefer not using formative <b>assessment</b> <b>method</b> due to many reasons such as gradually increasing number of students, workload and its time consumption. Advanced assessment means are needed for teachers to save time during assessment of large number of students. At this point, used information web technology covers majority of activities such as comparing, analyzing, and transferring of examination grades, and thus helps students and staff for feedback, time saving, relieving administrative workload and developing <b>assessment</b> <b>methods.</b> Information Technologies must be employed in meaningful assessment practices for not only transforming traditional assessments into electronic format but also testing students’ information and skills. In this study, web-based solutions are sought for problems arising from using of formative and summative <b>assessment</b> <b>methods</b> in traditional media.
