The effect was a dynamic style of architecture in which the forms <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on life of their own, moving, swaying and undulating. The name Baroque means 'mis-shapen pearl'.|$|E

Also, in , Artemis's alter ego, Orion, confesses his love to Holly and tries to woo her, although she is unnerved by his advances. In the last book Artemis and Holly are in a crisis and Artemis finally realizes his affection for Holly and kisses her on the forehead which seems to be for romantic reasons, however it is later revealed that this is only so Foaly can have Artemis' DNA sample to create a clone and revive him.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, Geronimo {{agreed to}} tell his story to S. M. Barrett, Superintendent of Education in Lawton, Oklahoma. Barrett had to appeal to President Roosevelt to gain {{permission}} to publish the book. Geronimo came to each interview knowing exactly what he wanted to say. He refused to answer questions or alter his narrative. Barrett did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> many liberties with Geronimo's story as translated by Asa Daklugie. Frederick Turner re-edited this autobiography by removing some of Barrett's footnotes and writing an introduction for the non-Apache readers. Turner notes the book is in the style of an Apache reciting part of his oral history.|$|E

25|$|Ellerbe's {{plan was}} not well {{received}} by the D.C. City Council or local citizens' groups. At an initial hearing in November 2012, the firefighters' union testified that paramedic vacancies led to staffing downgrades for the 14 overnight advanced life support ambulances, leaving them staffed with EMTs. An average of 4.4 advanced life support ambulances had been downgraded every night in the past year, the union said. Ellerbe dispute those numbers, but provided none on downgrades, saying that the real issue was call volume and not staffing. The D.C. Federation of Citizens Associations, a coalition of neighborhood citizens' groups, testified that similar redeployment plans were tested {{three times in the}} late 1980s and did not work. At a second hearing in December 2012, city council public safety committee chair Mendelson expressed frustration with plan, noting that DCFEMS has been unable to say how many paramedics it has on staff. (Ellerbe blamed a software problem for that.) Mendelson also said Ellerbe's plan also didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into account scheduled leave, illness, or unforeseen problems.|$|E
25|$|In Chullin 92a-b Ulla {{says that}} here are 30 laws which {{the sons of}} Noah took upon themselves. However he only lists three, namely the three that the Gentiles follow: not to create a Ketubah between males, not to sell carrion {{in the market and}} to respect the Torah. The rest of the laws are not listed. Talmud {{commentator}} Rashi remarks on this that he does not know the other Commandments that are referred to. Though the authorities <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it for granted that Ulla's thirty commandments included the original seven, an additional thirty laws is also possible from the reading. Two different lists of the 30 laws exist. Both lists include an additional twenty-three mitzvot which are subdivisions or extensions of the seven laws. One from the 16th-century work Asarah Maamarot by Rabbi Menahem Azariah da Fano and a second from the 10th century Samuel ben Hofni which was recently published from his Judeo-Arabic writings after having been found in the Cairo Geniza. Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Chajes suggests Menahem Azariah of Fano enumerated commandments are not related to the first seven, nor based on Scripture, but instead were passed down by oral tradition.|$|E

500|$|Fark's comment threads {{are often}} {{littered}} with various Farkisms or clich√©s. These are essentially in-jokes which either originated on Fark or on other sites (such as 4chan or Something Awful) {{that have become}} an integral part of the community culture and used in myriad discussions in the forums, regardless of whether they apply to the topic at hand. Several groups of people <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a bit more abuse than others on the site, including PETA, Catholic priests, the French, and Duke University, according to Curtis. The site has also become somewhat well known for including [...] "NSFW" [...] (Not Safe For Work) in the headlines of links that contain images or videos of a sensitive nature, and in 2007, attempted to file a trademark of the phrase. Fark was also involved in organizing the Rickrolling of the New York Mets in April 2008, when they encouraged readers to vote for Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up as the song to be played during every home game of the 2008 season.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, And if you have a problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E

I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science". Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that Ben had feelings for , but I still think it was... it was horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben probably has a tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got this amazing mind, she has this amazing, you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her". During season four the producers deliberately left it ambiguous as to whether Ben {{was a part of the}} Oceanic 6 (six survivors of the plane crash that make it off the Island) after he appeared in one of Sayid's flashforwards.|$|E

He also described the events as a demonstration that [...] "Ben has more cards than you think; ... he's a step or two ahead, one layer or two deeper than anyone else who is playing the game". The rabbit was a reference to Stephen King's , where King uses a rabbit in a cage with the number8 written on its back as an example for the connection between reader and writer. Emerson said that part of the appeal of the scene was that [...] "bunnies look so innocent, and the audience feels so tenderly about them you can feel nothing but beastly being mean to them". But Emerson added the rabbit in the scene had problems reacting to his attempts to scare him [...] "it was unfazed, it barely blinked".|$|E

Foreign people, likewise, are generally lumped in with the [...] "nine bows", people who threaten pharaonic rule and the stability of maat, although peoples allied with or subject to Egypt may be viewed more positively. For these reasons, events in Egyptian mythology rarely take place in foreign lands. While some stories pertain to the sky or the Duat, Egypt itself is usually the scene for the actions of the gods. Often, even the myths set in Egypt <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place on a plane of existence separate from that inhabited by living humans, although in other stories, humans and gods interact.

2500|$|Unlike the {{founding}} farther of criminology, Cesare Lombroso, {{who thought that}} crime was fundamentally biological in its origin and criminals lacked free will altogether, contemporary neurocriminologists <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the middle ground approach. They do not argue that biological factors alone cause behavioral problems, but recognize that behavior results from interaction between biology and environment. Some authors, however, are more determinist in their views. As one author writes: [...] "Free will may exist (it may simply be beyond our current science), but one thing seems clear: if free will does exist, it has little room in which to operate. It can at best be a small factor riding on top of vast neural networks shaped by genes and environment.
