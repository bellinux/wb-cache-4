500|$|Larger {{cockatoos}} {{can live}} 30 to 70 years {{depending on the}} species, or occasionally longer, and cockatiels can live for about 20 years. As pets they require a long-term commitment from their owners. Their longevity is considered a positive trait as it reduces instances {{of the loss of}} a pet. The oldest cockatoo in captivity was a Major Mitchell's cockatoo named [...] "Cookie", residing at Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, which lived to be 83 years old (1933-2016). A <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo</b> named 'King Tut' who resided at San Diego Zoo was nearly 69 when he died in 1990 and a palm cockatoo reached 56 in London Zoo in 2000. However, anecdotal reports describe birds of much greater ages. 'Cocky Bennett' of Tom Ugly's Point in Sydney was a celebrated sulphur-crested cockatoo who was reported to have reached an age of 100 years or more. He had lost his feathers and was naked for much of his life. A palm cockatoo was reported to have reached 80 or 90 years of age in an Australian zoo, and a little corella that was removed from a nest in central Australia in 1904 was reported still alive in the late 1970s. In February 2010, a white cockatoo named 'Arthur' was claimed to be 90 years old; he had lived with a family for generations in Dalaguete, Cebu, before being taken to Cebu City Zoo.|$|E

40|$|Several {{bird species}} are sexually monomorphic. In this case, {{molecular}} approach is an efficient method for their sex determination. The sexes of monomorphic birds {{can be determined}} by PCR amplification of the CHD genes. CHD genes are preserved within avian Z and W sex chromosomes. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine sex of 21 individuals quails, pigeons, hill myna, <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoos,</b> and yellow-crested cockatoos based on CHD genes using two pairs of primers: 2550 F- 2718 R and P 2 -P 8. Samples from Kampong chickens and ducks were used as controls. PCR products were screened by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide. Results showed that 2550 F and 2718 R primers could be used to identify sex of Kampong chickens, quails, ducks, pigeons, hill myna, <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoos,</b> and yellow-crested cockatoos. Individuals showed double (ZW) and single (ZZ) bands were identified as females and males, respectively in Kampong chickens, quails, hill myna, <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoos</b> and yellow-crested cockatoos. Males and females in ducks and pigeons showed single band in different length of base pairs. P 2 and P 8 primers could be used to identify the sex of pigeons, hill myna, <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoos,</b> and yellow-crested cockatoos. All of those samples showed bouble (ZW) bands for females and single (ZZ) band for males...|$|R

50|$|Near {{the station}} where the {{visitors}} {{get on the}} zoo train is an African penguin exhibit where visitors can view an educational penguin feeding program twice daily. Around the penguin exhibit are enclosures containing red river hog, African clawless otter, camels, and nearby is a South American exhibit containing specimens such as Brazilian tapir, greater rhea, llama, alpaca, king vulture, toucans, and new world primates, along with crested fireback and southern white-faced scops owl. A bat house is adjacent to the king vulture enclosure, and contains Indian flying fox, straw-colored fruit bat, two-toed sloth and prehensile-tailed porcupine. Nearby is an aviary containing blue-and-yellow macaws, <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoos,</b> red-crowned amazons, creasted screamers, Reeve's pheasants and an African grey parrot.|$|R

50|$|A {{major threat}} is posed by deforestation, with logging {{concessions}} covering 48% of Seram's forest, and illegal logging even having been recorded inside Manusela National Park. Another threat is posed by illegal wild bird trading, particularly targeting the <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo.</b> The {{population of the}} endemic <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo</b> is now gravely threatened due to hunting {{and the destruction of}} its habitat, and the park remains its last stronghold. For the first time in 2006 nine cockatoos have been released in the wild after being confiscated from a smuggler in 2004.|$|E
50|$|Of the 118 {{species of}} bird on the island, 15 are endemic, {{including}} the eclectus parrot, purple-naped lory, <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> lazuli kingfisher, sacred kingfisher, grey-necked friarbird, Moluccan king parrot, bicoloured white-eye, black-chinned monarch, and Seram masked owl.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{threats to}} cockatoos are habitat loss and the wildlife trade. All cockatoos {{are dependent on}} trees for nesting and are vulnerable to their loss; in addition many species have specialised habitat requirements or live on small islands and have naturally small ranges, making them vulnerable {{to the loss of}} these habitats. Cockatoos are popular as pets and the capture and trade has threatened some species; between 1983 and 1990, 66,654 recorded <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoos</b> were exported from Indonesia, a figure that does not include the number of birds caught for the domestic trade or that were exported illegally. The capture of many species has subsequently been banned but the trade continues illegally. Birds are put in crates or bamboo tubing and conveyed on boats out of Indonesia and the Philippines. Not only are the rare species smuggled out of Indonesia but also common and rare cockatoos alike are smuggled out of Australia; birds are sedated, covered in nylon stockings and packed into PVC tubing which is then placed in unaccompanied luggage on international flights. Mortality is significant (30%) and eggs, more easily hidden on the bodies of smugglers on flights, are increasingly smuggled instead. Trafficking is thought to be run by organised gangs, who also trade Australian species for overseas species such as macaws coming the other way.|$|R
5|$|Cockatoos {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can demand {{a great deal of}} attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given a steady supply of objects to tinker with, chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The <b>salmon-crested</b> and white <b>cockatoo</b> species are particular offenders. All cockatoos have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets. The cockatiel {{is one of the most}} popular and easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.|$|R
50|$|Seram Island is {{remarkable}} for its {{high degree of}} localised bird endemism. From the 117 species of birds on the island, 14 are endemic, including the eclectus parrot, purple-naped lory, <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> lazuli kingfisher, sacred kingfisher, grey-necked friarbird and Moluccan king parrot.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{at the zoo}} include American crow, <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> bantam chicken, {{military}} macaw, bald eagle, barred owl, Orpington chicken, African penguin, Dominique chickens, blue-and-yellow macaw, burrowing parrot, Campbell duck, cockatiels, Indian peafowl, red-tailed hawk, domestic ducks, white cockatoo, sulphur-crested cockatoo, eclectus parrot, and emu.|$|E
50|$|Parrots and toucans {{displayed}} {{outside the}} walking {{area of the}} park include African grey parrot, scarlet macaw, blue-and-yellow macaw, military macaw, great green macaw, hyacinth macaw, red-and-green macaw, Catalina macaw, white cockatoo, <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> galah, Alexandrine parakeet, princess parrot, channel-billed toucan, and white-throated toucan.|$|E
50|$|The <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo</b> can {{no longer}} be {{imported}} into the United States because it is listed on the Wild Bird Conservation Act. However, they are being bred in captivity. They are popular for their beauty and trainability (which makes them popular in trained bird shows).The <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo</b> is widely considered {{to be one of the}} most demanding parrots to keep as a pet due to their high intelligence, large size, potential noise level, and need to chew. Moluccan cockatoos require a very large and very sturdy cage or aviary. Salmon-crested cockatoos are highly social and pets can be extremely cuddly, affectionate, and gentle birds. This can lead to problems if a young cockatoo is spoiled with a great deal of attention and cuddling when young and does not get the opportunity to learn to play with toys, forage, or otherwise entertain itself.Salmon-crested cockatoos require a great deal of attention and activity to remain healthy and well-adjusted. Attention and training from human caregivers is important in keeping them occupied, as are chewable toys and foraging toys that require them to work for their food. As with most large cockatoos, the <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo</b> may develop health and behavioral problems such as feather-plucking and aggression if not provided with the appropriate environment, attention, and enrichment opportunities.|$|E
50|$|In {{the wild}} the <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo</b> inhabits lowland forests below 1000 m. The diet {{consists}} mainly of seeds, nuts and fruit, {{as well as}} coconuts. There is additional evidence that they eat insects off the ground, and pet Moluccan cockatoos have tested positive for anemia if their diet does not include enough protein.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{at the zoo}} include black-necked stilt, Inca tern, Mandarin duck, ring-necked parakeet, ringed teal, roseate spoonbill, scarlet ibis, Sulawesi ground dove, and white-faced {{whistling}} duck in the aviary, {{blue and}} gold macaw, double yellow-headed amazon parrot, <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> and scarlet macaw at the Parrot Pond, as well as burrowing owl, Caribbean flamingo, emu, great horned owl, and helmeted guineafowl.|$|E
5000|$|Cacatua is a {{subgenus}} of {{the white}} cockatoos (genus Cacatua). They are found in wooded habitats from Wallacea east to the Bismarck Archipelago and south to Australia. With {{the exception of the}} yellow-crested cockatoo, all are relatively large cockatoos with a total length of 45-55 cm (18-22 in). Their plumage is mainly white (tinged pinkish in the <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo),</b> and the underwing and -tail have a yellowish tinge. Their crest is expressive and brightly coloured in most species. Unlike the members of the subgenus Licmetis, the members of the subgenus Cacatua have a black bill.|$|E
50|$|The <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo</b> is a {{vulnerable}} species, {{and has been}} listed on appendix I of CITES since 1989, which makes trade in wild-caught birds illegal. Trade in captive bred birds is legal only with appropriate CITES certification. Numbers have declined due to illegal trapping for the cage-bird trade and habitat loss. During {{the height of the}} trapping of this species over 6,000 birds were being removed from the wild per year. It has a stronghold in Manusela National Park on Seram, although even today some illegal trapping continues.|$|E
50|$|The white {{cockatoo}} (Cacatua alba), {{also known as}} the umbrella cockatoo, is a medium-sized all-{{white cockatoo}} endemic to tropical rainforest on islands of Indonesia. When surprised, it extends a large and striking head crest, which has a semicircular shape (similar to an umbrella, hence the alternative name). The undersides of the wings and tail have a pale yellow or lemon color which flashes when they fly. It is similar to other species of white cockatoo such as yellow-crested cockatoo, sulphur-crested cockatoo, and <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> all of which have yellow, orange or pink crest feathers instead of white.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Salmon-crested</b> <b>{{cockatoo}}</b> (Cacatua moluccensis) {{also known}} as the Moluccan cockatoo, is a cockatoo endemic to the Seram archipelago in eastern Indonesia. At a height of up to 46-52 cm and weight of up to 850 g, it is among the largest of the white cockatoos. The female is larger than the male on average. It has white-pink feathers with a definite peachy glow, a slight yellow on the underwing and underside of the tail feathers and a large retractable recumbent crest which it raises when threatened, revealing hitherto concealed bright red-orange plumes to frighten potential attackers. It may also be raised in excitement or in other 'emotional' displays. Some describe the crest as [...] "flamingo-colored." [...] It also has one of the louder calls in the parrot world and in captivity is a capable mimic.|$|E
5000|$|In his 1941 {{autobiography}} All in a Lifetime, Buck did {{not mention}} his clashes with the Zoological Society board, his firing, or the subsequent lawsuit. He did, however, claim that [...] "while acting as temporary director of the San Diego Zoo", he had invented a method of force-feeding snakes, the means [...] "by which captive pythons are mainly fed today." [...] He made one subsequent contribution to the Zoo, though indirectly: Having returned to his animal-collecting career, in 1925 he brought a shipment of animals to San Diego including a <b>salmon-crested</b> <b>cockatoo</b> named [...] "King Tut" [...] from the Maluku Islands. The bird was sold to a La Mesa, California couple who shared it with the Zoo. King Tut went on to appear in several films, television shows, and theater productions, and was the [...] "official greeter" [...] of the Zoo for decades, sitting on a perch inside the entrance to squawk at guests Following King Tut's death in 1990, a bronze statue of the cockatoo {{was placed in the}} location of its longtime perch and remains there today, its plaque indicating that the bird [...] "was brought from Indonesia in 1925 by Frank Buck".|$|E
