Larkin's drumming is thought to [...] "worship at the twin altars of Neil Peart and John Bonham". And Rombola's guitar playing style has been praised as [...] "guitars that sound like percussion instruments".|$|E
500|$|The song {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Kyle Anderson for MTV considered [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] as [...] "a similar-sounding anthem [...] with some streamlined rock guitar taking center stage (there's even a solo). It's catchy enough." [...] Spence D. of IGN considered [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] a [...] " [...] Martin's glossy grown-up pop" [...] song, while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone called [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] a [...] "further hit" [...] from ...Baby One More Time, along with [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] and [...] "Sometimes". Music critic Walt Mueller wrote [...] "When Spears starts to sing on this one, she <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> like Janet Jackson." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press {{noted that the}} song and [...] "Stronger" [...] are [...] "so lamely feel-good" [...] tracks that they [...] "could have been the theme song to a 'Karate Kid' sequel." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called it a [...] "lightly dorky" [...] song, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic deemed it as a [...] "fluffy dance-pop at its best." [...] In a list compiled by Sara Anderson of AOL Radio, [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] was ranked ninth in a list of Spears' best songs.

500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the video, Roberts {{released}} still images to website 3am. These showed her in what was described as [...] "some sort of untidy, yet fashionable looking house", while one showed her with her legs above her head wearing [...] "Kandee's caramel kisses shoes" [...] and a third and final seeing her [...] "cosying up next to a handsome chap". [...] The same day, Roberts gave two more exclusive stills to website Digital Spy; in one image, she was smelling roses, while, in the second, she was [...] "playing with a pair of shoes". The video was released on 30 November 2011. After the official release, Nadia Mendoza of the Daily Mail stated the video was a departure from her previous two videos (for [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] and [...] "Lucky Day"), saying that it [...] "looks and <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more grown up as she teases viewers by stripping to her bra and frolicking in the shower." [...] Mendoza found that Roberts was [...] "becoming quite the chameleon" [...] and had [...] "trampled all over her innocent charm to create a sex siren", referencing her transformation throughout her videos. Katherine St Asaph, of Pop Dust, found that the video's low budget had had a negative effect. She interpreted scenes with Roberts repeated changes clothing positively, noting [...] "t works because of the lyrics what, besides other people, can mess with your feelings more than trying on clothes?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Billie Jean" [...] was {{recorded}} by American rock musician Chris Cornell for his Carry On album in 2007. Cornell {{said of his}} cover, [...] "I didn't plan on it. It just sort of happened organically. I changed the music quite a bit, I didn't touch the lyrics." [...] He added, [...] "And it's not a joke. I took a completely different approach to it, musically." [...] Cornell had previously performed the song live in Europe, including an acoustic set in Stockholm, Sweden in September 2006. He later said, [...] "I {{was getting ready to}} do some acoustic shows on a promotional tour for Revelations and I just wanted to have fun with it." [...] The cover received favorable reviews from critics. MTV noted the [...] "bluesier, more pained and impassioned feel" [...] which stripped away [...] "any pop elements of the original". Los Angeles Times described the track as [...] "a grim, spooky take" [...] on Jackson's [...] "Billie Jean", and added that it was [...] "amusing enough, even if it <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more like Metallica's 'Nothing Else Matters'". The newspaper concluded that [...] "Jacko's mega hit [...] the stunt translation". In 2008, Cornell's version was performed live by David Cook on the seventh season of American Idol, and this version charted on Billboard's Hot 100 at No. 47. In May of the same year, dance act Signature used [...] "Nachna Onda Nei" [...] on Britain's Got Talent in their audition and again in their final performance.

Other aspects of the film are inexplicably wrong. Eddie's music sounds good, but it also <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> like Bruce Springsteen's, and {{it would not have been}} the rage in 1963." [...] However, she did praise Paré's performance: [...] "Mr. Paré makes a fine debut; he captures the manner of a hot-blooded young rocker with great conviction, and his lip-synching is almost perfect." ...|$|E

[...] Secombe then attempts to [...] "start the show" [...] which <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> like starting, or rather failing to start, a car. [...] This play on words was used by Milligan in his other scripts, particularly the contemporaneous [...] "Milligna Show". [...] The tone of the whole show, in fact, was much more like Milligan's then-current writing {{than any of the}} original shows.

2500|$|The Washington Post said: [...] "is forever {{struggling}} with words and emotions on her debut album The Divine Comedy, forever {{trying to make}} sense of love or the lack of it. She never succeeds, of course, but her tenacity is what makes the album worth hearing. Evoking a curious combination of childlike innocence, Harlequin romance and hippie sentimentality, her songs are tone poems of a sort, inspired by vulnerability and wariness, sung in a small, plaintive, unguarded soprano. At times she seems hopelessly lovesick, a prime candidate for any heartbreaker's ruse, but on [...] "You Did It All Before," [...] "Clock," [...] and [...] "Don't Fade Away" [...] she <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> older and wiser, no stranger to hurt and disillusionment." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{concludes with}} the love songs, [...] "Comfort You", [...] "Come Here My Love", and [...] "Country Fair"—the latter two {{employing}} the traditional Irish ballad style. [...] To Clinton Heylin, the songs also spoke to [...] "the {{healing power of}} love... here at last are songs that speak of {{what he can do}} for her, rather than concerned solely with his needs and wants." [...] Heylin comments on the song, [...] "Come Here My Love": [...] "This is no 'Autumn Song'. Rather, it <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> like a man learning how to love again." [...] Morrison spoke of [...] "Country Fair" [...] as having the same kind of feeling as [...] "And It Stoned Me", although that song was used to open the Moondance album, instead of as a kind of closure.|$|E
50|$|Jerk is {{the second}} album by Canadian alternative/indie rock band hHead, {{released}} in 1994. The prize money that hHead won from a CFNY-FM contest went towards paying the costs for making this album. Some critics say that this album <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more 'produced' than the previous album, Fireman, {{mainly because of the}} style change, from <b>a</b> garagey <b>sound</b> to <b>a</b> more professional <b>sound.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Scott Yanow {{reviewed}} the album for Allmusic and wrote that [...] "The most memorable tracks include [...] "Walkin'," [...] "Love Walked In" [...] and a nearly 12-minute rendition of [...] "Love Is Just Around the Corner."

2500|$|Allmusic {{staff writer}} Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album {{four and a}} half out of five stars. He said, [...] "This is further proof that Pearl Jam {{consciously}} turned away from the big, anthemic sound and spirit that won them a mass audience with Ten—they still had the songs and sound, they just chose to bury it. Lost Dogs crackles with that passion and it has another advantage: unlike most of Pearl Jam's albums, it's a fun, compulsive listen. More than any other album in its catalog, Lost Dogs captures what Pearl Jam stood for and what it felt like at their peak." [...] Rolling Stone staff writer David Fricke gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "for an album of odds 'n' sods, Lost Dogs sure <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> like a pack of hits." ...|$|E

5000|$|Throughout the {{recording}} career of the Carter Sisters & Mother Maybelle, {{much of the}} time, all four group members had individual recording contracts as well.

5000|$|Applied {{pressure}}. Amount {{of applied}} pressure tends to vary the <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> Slight touch makes light muting, thus producing more pronounced, fuller sounds. Pressing the hand down intensively makes heavy muting, enhancing staccato effect, adding percussion and making notes less recognizable. Certainly, with some amplification gain, heavily muted notes sound quieter than lightly muted, but given {{a fair amount}} of compression, loudness levels become the same and heavily muted notes sound less muddy, with fewer overtones and tonal characteristics than lightly muted.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{intensity}} of the sessions, the band still found time to goof off. Violinist Caitlin Cary remembers getting drunk and riding a horse bareback across a nearby field, while other band members played around with firecrackers - which inspired Adams to later remark: [...] "Out in the parking lot across the street... the Roman candles and Black Cats <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> like I'd hope we'd one day sound - pretty little things all set on fire waiting to get destroyed." ...|$|R
