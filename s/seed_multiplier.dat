The Sahel is the origin of pearl millet and sorghum, seed selection and management of these crops is embedded in local cultures, and most producers of these crops are subsistence oriented. Despite seed sector reform, no certified seed of these crops is sold in local markets and farmers prefer to rely on themselves or each other for seed. The dominant source of certified seed is the national seed service. Certified <b>seed</b> is <b>multiplied</b> by contracted farmers and seed producer groups, and supplied to farmers through farmers' associations, development organizations, and extension services. The informal sector supplies farmers with non-certified seed directly and indirectly through village grain markets. There is no consensus about whether it is lack of effective demand or supply that constrains farmer use of certified sorghum and millet seed, but researchers generally conclude {{that the process of}} certifying seed is too lengthy, some mechanism must be established for production and trade of locally-adapted landraces, and Mali's highly structured farmers' associations could play an even stronger role in testing and promoting demand for certified seed. Recommendations have included the use of small packs and seed auctions where market infrastructure is sparse, and in more commercialized areas, involvement of agro-input dealers, shopkeepers and traders. Still, estimated adoption rates for improved millet (under 10 percent of crop area) and sorghum seed (under 20 percent of crop area) could be as high as can be expected in this challenging natural environment and institutional context.

Much {{research has been}} devoted to elucidating the mechanisms governing the initial attachment of single cells to surfaces. However, in natural environments and during infection, bacterial cells tend to clump as multicellular aggregates, and biofilms can also slough off aggregates {{as a part of the}} dispersal process. This makes it likely that biofilms are often seeded by aggregates and single cells, yet how these aggregates impact biofilm initiation and development is not known. Here we use a combination of experimental and computational approaches to determine the relative fitness of single cells and preformed aggregates during early development of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. We find that the relative fitness of aggregates depends markedly on the density of surrounding single cells, i. e., the level of competition for growth resources. When competition between aggregates and single cells is low, an aggregate has a growth disadvantage because the aggregate interior has poor access to growth resources. However, if competition is high, aggregates exhibit higher fitness, because extending vertically above the surface gives cells at the top of aggregates better access to growth resources. Other advantages of seeding by aggregates, such as earlier switching to a biofilm-like phenotype and enhanced resilience toward antibiotics and immune response, may add to this ecological benefit. Our findings suggest that current models of biofilm formation should be reconsidered to incorporate the role of aggregates in biofilm initiation...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{in an effort}} to reconcile the conflicting proline-accumulating responses of the barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars, Excelsior and Proctor, reported by Singh et al. (1972) and Hanson et al. (1976). It deals with the effects of different vapor pressure deficits (VPD) during growth and subsequent drought stress on several barley cultivars. A higher VPD (1. 2 kilopascals) during Clipper seedling growth resulted in higher solute-accumulating ability, seemingly independently of leaf water potential, than a lower VPD (0. 12 kilopascals). The higher VPD during stress also resulted in higher solute contents, and this response may be more closely related to leaf water potential. When the responses of Excelsior and Proctor were examined in detail, {{it was found that the}} relative proline-accumulating ability of the two cultivars was dependent upon the VPD under which they were grown. At low VPD, Proctor accumulated significantly more proline than did Excelsior; whereas at higher VPD, Excelsior accumulated more proline than did Proctor. The crossover occurred at a VPD of about 0. 72 kilopascals. This reversal of cultivar response was enhanced by <b>multiplying</b> <b>seed</b> under the two VPD extremes. Glycinebetaine accumulation did not demonstrate the crossover effect, although the concentration of this compound in all cultivars also depended on the VPD prevailing during growth and/or stress.

It is concluded that the conflicting proline-accumulating responses of Excelsior and Proctor could be explained by these findings...|$|R

The data presented are part of an ethnographic study carried out among a network of ecological farmers, Ecovida, in the west of Santa Catarina state. The current global patent regime, most prominently the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), has had direct effects on seed production and agricultural food crops. In a scenario of increasing creation of patents, patent regulations, provisions on cultivars (plant varieties and seed breeding) {{and a number of other}} global trade control mechanisms, family farmers and other related social actors have rejected the multilateral development agencies' notion of life as "resource". This study has a two-fold aim: first, it approaches the international context of the intellectual property regime on biodiversity and knowledge production; second, it examines the actions taken by farmers participating in the Ecovida network toward creating alternative ways of managing knowledge to produce "free" seeds. As an outcome, there is a parallel political action of criticism and resistance to the current narrowing of agriculture's genetic base, and organized efforts to <b>multiply</b> <b>seeds,</b> know-how and knowledge through networks, banks and centers of agro-biodiversity.

In addition, the linkage among fruit production stakeholders was very weak. Moreover, fruit seedlings from local <b>seeds</b> were only <b>multiplied</b> and distributed from the government fruit nursery and the supply was inadequate.

The stakeholders also identified possible interventions along the value chain and subsequently intervened in capacity building (orchard management and propagation techniques), improved varieties introduction, input supply (established private nurseries, introduced grafting in government nurseries), stakeholders linkage and marketing of outputs. Thirteen (13) private fruit nurseries were established in four Peasant Associations (PAs) and in Bure town, which produced 68 % of the seedlings in the district in 2008. Poor women and landless youth were also able to participate. The skill and knowledge of farmers, Development Agents (DAs) and experts improved through training and study tours which created linkages with new knowledge and capacity development actors. However, shortage of scion to multiply grafted fruit planting materials hampered mango and avocado expansion. i. e. only 3 % of the mango and avocado seedlings in 2008 were grafted.

To make progress on this goal, we have (1) harnessed the genetic diversity in Miscanthus by crossing and progeny testing thousands of parental combinations to select several candidate seed-based hybrids adapted to European environments, (2) established field scale seed production methods with annual multiplication factors > 1500 ?, (3) developed the agronomy for establishing large stands from seed sown plug plants to reduce establishment times by a year compared to M ? g, (4) trialled a range of harvest techniques to improve compositional quality and logistics on a large scale, (5) performed spatial analyses of yield potential and land availability to identify regional opportunities across Europe and doubled the area within the bio-climatic envelope, (6) considered on-farm economic, practical and environmental benefits that can be attractive to growers. The technical barriers to adoption have now been overcome sufficiently such that Miscanthus is ready to use as a low-carbon feedstock in the European bio-economypublishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) {{have been}} grown for decades for home {{consumption}} and commercial use in highlands of Burundi where temperature {{is lower than}} in the lower lands. All attempts to introduce them in the lowlands of Burundi failed because the material tested always appeared not to be suitable to this hot environment with regard to tuber yield and other agronomic characteristics. A set of 15 potato genotypes presented as more tolerant to high temperatures was hence introduced in 2004 from the International Potato Center (CIP) and tested together with nine local varieties in various environments for three years. From the coolest environment (16. 9 °C) to the hottest one (26 °C); fresh tuber yield, dry tuber yield, tuber dry matter concentration and harvest index decreased significantly. However, combined analysis indicated that, if heat tolerant cultivars are grown in the lowlands of Burundi, a fresh tuber yield of 13 t ha- 1 or more should be expected whereas a non suitable cultivar like Ndinamagara (Cruza 148) would produce only 2. 7 t ha- 1. Contrary to what was expected, an early maturing variety (Victoria) and a late maturing clone (395194. 9) performed satisfactorily in both cool (highlands) and warm conditions. Four clones (390663. 8, 395194. 9, 388972. 22 and 388611. 22) and one variety (Victoria) {{were found to be}} the most suitable for the Imbo region (warm areas). Furthermore, the hot climate negatively influenced the tuber set, and therefore, tuber number was lower (23. 3 tubers per plant in highlands and 7. 1 in lowlands). The agronomic implication is that the Imbo region could be appropriate for consumer potatoes but not economically appropriate for seed production. The <b>seed</b> could be <b>multiplied</b> in highlands and then brought to Imbo for commercial production. Despite the satisfactory fresh tuber yields obtained by these genotypes under high temperatures in comparison with other genotypes or the average national potato yield reported to be 2. 7 t ha- 1 by FAO, we believe that their potential was not achieved and higher yields could be obtained with better crop management. Therefore, there is need to carry out complementary studies on agricultural techniques aiming at increasing the yields obtained so far...|$|R
40|$|The Improving Productivity and Market Success (IPMS) of Ethiopian Farmers project {{adopted a}} “participatory market {{oriented}} commodity value chain development” approach, to address problems and potentials for haricot bean production in Alaba Special District, in Southern Ethiopia. With an emerging export market potential, attention {{needs to be}} paid {{not only to the}} production of haricot beans but also to the supply of inputs and services and marketing. Major problems diagnosed by the value chain partners included poor access to inputs including seeds, weed and disease problems, poor technology adoption and marketing of haricot bean. To address the above problems, various development actors developed haricot bean commodity with the IPMS project and Alaba Special District Office of Agriculture and Rural Development (OoARD) introduced value chain interventions {{for the past five years}} (2005 to 2010). Initial intervention focused at building farmers capacity to <b>multiply</b> <b>seed</b> and establish seed bank using visits, trainings, demonstration, workshops, promotion and discussion. Later, to improve supply of inputs (seeds, fertilizer and agro-chemicals) support was provided to establish cooperative shop, private crop protection service and revolving fund with IPMS credit fund while comparing soil fertility technologies. Additional effort also focused at marketing of small pack, promotion of haricot bean, market linkage and establishment of seed cooperative. Findings show an increase in farmers’ market participation from 54. 5 % in 2004 during baseline survey to 92 % in 2009 during sample household survey. There is an increase in the proportion of farmers’ producing seed and change in focus from household consumption to seed business in targeted 19 PAs (Peasant Association). Survey results show a higher yield (9. 5 qt/ha) among fertilizer users compared with non users (7. 2 qt/ha). On-farm yield plot trial (n= 387) with 129 households (HH) in 17 PAs for three years shows mean yield of 7. 04, 4. 1 and 2. 76 qt/ha for chemical fertilizer, haricot bean inoculants and control plots respectively. Farmers have clearly indicated their preference for the red and/or speckled varieties to white varieties. Increase in haricot bean seed multipliers from 64 HH in 4 PA to 426 HH in 19 PAs resulted in establishment of seed cooperative. While more actors are increasingly involved in value chain development leading to market oriented production, there is informal partnership and poor linkage among value chain actors. The study draws lessons on increasing production of haricot bean, strengthening input supply system and development of market intervention. On the basis of the findings, the paper outlines challenges, lessons and provides recommendations to improve existing value chain for development partners.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi obter linhagens de feijão comum do grupo {{comercial}} "carioca" com resistência às principais doenças fúngicas da parte aérea do feijoeiro. Para isso, famílias F 2 : 3 previamente obtidas e selecionadas por apresentarem marcas moleculares relacionadas a genes de resistência à antracnose (Co- 10, Co- 6, Co- 5 e Co- 42), ferrugem (Ur-ON) e mancha angular (Phg- 1) foram avançadas até a completa fixação dos alelos de resistência. Em cada geração, marcadores moleculares do tipo SCAR associados aos genes de resistência foram utilizados para identificar plantas contendo todos os genes de interesse. Na geração F 6, doze linhagens homozigotas foram identificadas (linhagens Rudá-R 1) e utilizadas em cruzamentos com as cultivares/linhagens elite Pérola, BRSMG Talismã, VC 9, VC 3 e com uma isolinha da cultivar Rudá, piramidada para os genes Ur- 11, Ur- 5 e Ur-ON/Co- 10 (linhagem Rudá- R 2). Visando a seleção de famílias resistentes, populações F 2 obtidas dos cruzamentos das linhagens Rudá-R 1 com as cultivares/linhagens elite Pérola, BRSMG Talismã, VC 9 e VC 3 foram inoculadas com um patótipo de cada um dos agentes causais de antracnose, ferrugem e mancha angular. Já a população F 2 obtida do cruzamento Rudá- R 1 x Rudá-R 2 foi genotipada com marcadores moleculares do tipo SCAR estreitamente ligados aos genes Co- 6, Co- 5, Co- 42 e Ur- 5. As plantas F 2 selecionadas, por apresentarem resistência aos três patógenos, tiveram suas sementes multiplicadas, assim como as plantas selecionadas por apresentarem marcas moleculares relacionadas aos genes Co- 6, Co- 5, Co- 42 e Ur- 5 (cruzamento Rudá-R 1 x Rudá-R 2). Adicionalmente, as doze linhagens homozigotas (Rudá-R 1) foram avaliadas em dois ensaios de campo, realizados nas safras do "inverno" de 2007 e da "seca" de 2008, enquanto as famílias F 2 : 4 provenientes dos cinco cruzamentos supracitados foram avaliadas em campo apenas na safra da "seca" de 2008. O delineamento experimental utilizado nos dois experimentos foi o látice quadrado triplo. Uma caracterização da resistência das linhagens homozigotas (Rudá-R 1) a diferentes patótipos de antracnose, ferrugem e mancha angular, também foi realizada, em casa de vegetação. A análise conjunta das duas safras evidenciou que a produtividade de grãos das linhagens homozigotas obtidas (Rudá-R 1) é equivalente à produtividade das cultivares modernas. No entanto, para o caráter aspecto de grão, estas linhagens são significativamente inferiores às testemunhas comerciais. Em relação à antracnose e à mancha angular, as doze linhagens apresentaram espectro de resistência idêntico ao dos genitores doadores G 2333 (Co- 42 e Co- 5) e AND 277 (Phg- 1). No caso da ferrugem, uma maior variabilidade no espectro de resistência das linhagens foi observada, embora, de modo geral, elas tenham apresentado resistência comparável a do genitor doador Ouro Negro (Ur-ON). Dos cinco cruzamentos realizados com as linhagens Rudá-R 1, apenas o cruzamento Rudá- R 1 x Rudá-R 2 não gerou famílias com aspecto de grão similar ao das cultivares modernas. No entanto, o potencial de extração de famílias superiores para o caráter rendimento de grãos foi o mesmo para as cinco populações avaliadas. Outro propósito deste trabalho foi caracterizar os genes que determinam a resistência à antracnose nas cultivares Widusa e AND 277. Para tanto, estas duas cultivares foram cruzadas com fontes de resistência à antracnose já caracterizadas. As populações segregantes obtidas destes cruzamentos foram avaliadas em relação à resistência a distintos patótipos do agente causal da antracnose. Como resultado ficou constatado que os genes de resistência à antracnose presentes nas cultivares Widusa e AND 277 segregam de forma independente dos locos de resistência Co- 4 / Co- 42, Co- 5, Co- 6 e Co- 11, mas que não segregam em relação aos locos Co- 1 e Co- 3 /Co- 9. Como conclusão destes trabalhos, pode-se dizer que os marcadores moleculares empregados no processo de obtenção das linhagens Rudá-R 1 foram eficientes na piramidação dos genes Co- 42, Co- 5, Co- 6, Phg- 1 e Ur-ON/Co- 10; que estas linhagens constituem uma fonte adaptada de importantes genes de resistência a doenças para uso em programas de melhoramento do feijoeiro do Brasil; por fim, que tanto a cultivar Widusa quanto a AND 277 apresentam alelos de resistência à antracnose nos locos Co- 1 e Co- 3 /Co- 9. In {{order to}} get lines of common bean related to the commercial "carioca-type" with resistance to main fungal diseases of the aerial parts of the bean, F 2 : 3 families previously selected {{for the presence of}} molecular markers linked to anthracnose (Co- 10, Co- 6, Co- 5 and Co- 4 ²), rust (Ur-ON) and angular leaf spot (Phg- 1) resistance genes were advanced to complete fixation of resistance alleles. In each generation, SCAR molecular markers associated with resistant genes were used to identify plants containing all the genes of interest. In F 6 generation, twelve homozygous lines were identified (lines Rudá-R 1) and utilized in crossings with the cultivars/lines elite Pérola, BRSMG Talismã, VC 9, VC 3 and with a isoline of the cultivar Rudá, already pyramided with the genes Ur- 11, Ur- 5 and Ur-ON/Co- 10 (line Rudá-R 2). Aiming at the selection of resistant families, F 2 populations from the cross between lines Rudá-R 1 with cultivars/lines elite Pérola, BRSMG Talismã, VC 9 and VC 3 were inoculated with a pathotype of anthracnose, rust and angular leaf spot causal agents. While the F 2 population from the cross Rudá-R 1 x Rudá-R 2 was genotyped with SCAR molecular markers closed related to genes Co- 6, Co- 5, Co- 4 ², and Ur- 5. The F 2 plants selected, for showing resistance to three pathogens had their <b>seeds</b> <b>multiplied,</b> and the plants selected by molecular markers for the presence of molecular markers linked to genes Co- 6, Co- 5, Co- 42 and Ur- 5 (crossing Rudá-R 1 x Rudá-R 2). Additionally, the twelve homozygous lines (Rudá-R 1) were evaluated in two field analysis, realized in "winter" season of 2007 and of the "drought" of 2008, while the F 2 : 4 families descendant from five cross above were evaluated in the field only in the "drought" season of 2008. The experimental delineation utilized in two experiments was the triple lattice square. A characterization of the resistance of the homozygous lines (Rudá-R 1) to different pathotypes of the anthracnose, rust and angular leaf spots was also realized in greenhouse. The conjoint analysis of the two harvests showed that the production of the homozygous lines grains (Rudá-R 1) is equivalent to production of the modern cultivars. However, the grain aspects of the lines are significantly lower than commercial controls. In relation to anthracnose and angular spot, the twelve lines showed resistance spectrum identical to the donor parents G 2333 (Co- 4 ² and Co- 5) and AND 277 (Phg- 1). In the case of the rust, a higher variability in the resistance spectrum of the lines was observed, although, in general way, they showed comparable resistance to the donor parent Ouro Negro (Ur-ON). From five crossings realized with lines Rudá-R 1, only the crossing Rudá-R 1 x Rudá- 2 did not generate families with spectrum of similar grain to the modern cultivars. However, the potential of extraction of superior families to the character yield of grain was the same for the populations evaluated. Other purpose of this work, was characterize the genes that determine the resistance to anthracnose in the cultivars Widusa and AND 277. For this, two cultivars were crossed with resistance sources to anthracnose already characterized. The segregating populations of these crossings were evaluated in relation to resistance to different pathotypes of the anthracnose causal agent. As result it was verified that the resistance genes to anthracnose presents in the cultivars Widusa and AND 277 segregate in a independent way of the resistance loci Co- 4 /Co- 4 ², Co- 5, Co- 6 and Co- 11, but those do not segregate in relation to loci Co- 1 and Co- 3 /Co- 9. As conclusion of these works, it can say that the molecular markers used in the acquisition lines Rudá-R 1 were efficient for pyramiding genes Co- 4 ², Co- 5, Co- 6, Co- 10, Phg- 1 and Ur-ON; that these lines constitute an adapted source of important resistance genes to diseases for use in common bean breeding programs in Brazil; finally, that both the cultivar Widusa and AND 277 presents resistance alleles to anthracnose in the loci Co- 1 and Co- 3 /Co- 9...|$|R
