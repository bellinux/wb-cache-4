5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} educational access, enrollment rates more than doubled between 1996 and 2006. However, education quality is weak, producing high rates of grade repetition and dropout. Education policy in Ravalomanana's second term focused on quality issues, including an increase in minimum education standards for the recruitment of primary teachers from a middle school leaving certificate (BEPC) to a high school leaving certificate (BAC), and a reformed teacher training program to support the transition from traditional didactic instruction to student-centered teaching methods to boost <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> participation in the classroom. Public expenditure on education was 13.4percent of total government expenditure and 2.9percent of GDP in 2008. Primary classrooms are crowded, with average pupil to teacher ratios of 47:1 in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{publication}} {{presents and}} elaborates {{a set of}} standards {{for use in a}} variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate. [...] In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic. [...] For example, the student accuracy standards help ensure that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> performance.|$|E

2500|$|Qualitative research, such as case studies, action research, {{discourse}} analysis, {{and clinical}} interviews, depend on small but focused samples {{in an attempt}} to understand <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> to look at how and why a given method gives the results it does. Such studies cannot conclusively establish that one method is better than another, as randomized trials can, but unless it is understood why treatment X is better than treatment Y, application of results of quantitative studies will often lead to [...] "lethal mutations" [...] of the finding in actual classrooms. Exploratory qualitative research is also useful for suggesting new hypotheses, which can eventually be tested by randomized experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative studies therefore are considered essential in education—just as in the other social sciences. Many studies are “mixed”, simultaneously combining aspects of both quantitative and qualitative research, as appropriate.|$|E
2500|$|Instructors {{appear to}} use podcasts {{in several ways}} within {{academic}} settings. For example, podcasts are used to duplicate the classroom lecture. [...] The student attends the lecture and uses the podcast as a backup for reviewing complex topics. Podcasts are also used to share additional information with students {{in the form of}} audio recordings that aid <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> provide support in relation to core learning materials. This includes assignment tips, hints, and pre/post-assignment feedback, along with additional audio to supplement subject content. Language, Science and Social Studies teachers in K-12 settings use podcasts of news coverage, historically significant speeches, cultural events and official happenings as rich trappings for the teaching-learning process. Students in a French or Political Science class can listen, for example, to a podcast of former French President Jacques Chirac's actual voice as he departs his presidential position. They could also listen to French citizens as they discuss Chirac's position.|$|E
