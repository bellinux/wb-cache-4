However, a questionable efficacy is still identified to choose <b>suctioning</b> <b>pressure</b> between 130 mmHg and 140 mmHg that is effective for patients with endotracheal tube. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of 130 mmHg and 140 mmHg <b>suctioning</b> <b>pressure</b> on oxygen saturation in patients with endotracheal tube. Methods: This research used a quasy experimental design with pretest and posttest group. The study was conducted from 31 January to 1 March 2017 in the Hospital of Panti Wilasa Citarum and Hospital of Roemani Muhammadiyah Semarang. There were 30 samples recruited using consecutive sampling, with 15 assigned in the 130 mmHg and 140 mmHg <b>suctioning</b> <b>pressure</b> group. Pulse oximetry was used to measure oxygen saturation. Paired t-test and Independent t-test were used for data analysis. Results: Findings showed that there was a statistically significant effect of 130 and 140 mmHg <b>suctioning</b> <b>pressure</b> on oxygen saturation in patients with ETT with p-value < 0. 05. There was a significant mean difference of oxygen saturation between 130 mmHg and 140 mmHg <b>suctioning</b> <b>pressure</b> group with p-value 0. 004 (< 0. 05). The mean difference of oxygen saturation between both groups was 13. 157. Conclusion: The 140 mmHg <b>suctioning</b> <b>pressure</b> is more effective compared with 130 mmHg <b>suctioning</b> <b>pressure</b> in increasing oxygen saturation in patients with ETT. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{constant}} <b>suction</b> negative <b>pressure</b> {{is used in}} {{coal mines}} owing {{to a lack of}} research on the effects of diffusion and <b>suction</b> negative <b>pressure</b> on methane extraction, resulting in the low methane concentration and utilization rate. In this study, Comsol Multiphysics is used to conduct a numerical solution of a gasÂ¿solid coupling model considering pseudo-steady diffusion in coal matrix, seepage in fractures, permeability evolution and coal deformation. The simulation results reveal the methane migration law and the effect of the diffusion process on the methane migration. The role and the influence degree of the <b>suction</b> negative <b>pressure</b> on methane extraction are studied, demonstrating that the <b>suction</b> negative <b>pressure</b> effect weakens gradually with the increasing methane extraction time. The methane concentrations of different <b>suction</b> negative <b>pressures</b> are calculated considering the changing effects of diffusion and <b>suction</b> negative <b>pressure</b> combined with the parallel relation between the methane migration and the air leakage, indicating that reducing the <b>suction</b> negative <b>pressure</b> can effectively increase the methane concentration. To change the present situation of the low methane concentration and utilization rate in coal mines, a new technical measure of methane extraction through parallel boreholes in groups is proposed to adjust the <b>suction</b> negative <b>pressure</b> and increase the methane utilization rate...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of chloride Ion levels In coarse colliery discards was undertaken because modem British Coal practice is to restore discard tips and lagoon embankments {{at an early}} stage in construction, commonly before much leaching has taken place. High chloride ion concentrations result in physiological drought and the failure of vegetation cover. Sites at two collieries were studied using grid and traverse (depth) sampling procedures. Results Indicate downward leaching of chloride ions into the embankment during Winter months and an increase in chloride levels towards the surface of the discard during dry, summer months. Salt hotspots occur on embankment surfaces during Summer months. These high chloride/sulphate concentrations represent the desiccation of seepages, most of which are related to embankment construction inadequacies, rather than to lagoons incorporated into the structure. Chlorides within the discard originate from formation waters intimately associated with Coal Measures sequences. In the eastern coalfields in particular, high chloride ion concentrations in the coal and waste rock from deep underground excavations are not removed by the coal washing processes. Consequently, they are retained in fresh colliery discards. Seasonal movements of chloride ions are associated with an increase In (negative) <b>suction</b> <b>pressures</b> within the near-surface layers of a colliery embankment. <b>Suction</b> <b>pressures</b> were monitored experimentally in two experimental tips and in the field at a third colliery site (Bilsthorpe Colliery). On an annual basis, <b>suction</b> <b>pressures</b> become operative early in April, reversing to residual negative or small positive pore pressures in mid-September. The leaching of chlorides from discard embankments {{is a function of the}} drainage characteristics of the materials and in clayey discards leaching to low levels is shown to take 5 to 7 years. Hotspots do not decrease significantly. The results of the present investigation can be applied to current embankment restoration schemes. In particular, the sowing of an embankment during the Autumn window, when electrolytes move downwards into the structure, would enable young vegetation to become established before being subjected to the higher Summer chloride concentrations. Hotspots require individual field drainage treatment...|$|R

The forebody pressures were integrated to obtain forebody yawing moments. Results showed that small single strake deflections can cause an undesirable yawing moment reversal. At alpha = 50 deg., this reversal was corrected by deploying both strakes at 20 deg. initially, then differentially from 20 deg. to create a yawing moment. The off-surface flow visualization showed {{that in the case}} of the small single strake deflection, the resulting forebody/strake vortex remained close to the surface and caused accelerated flow and increased <b>suction</b> <b>pressures</b> on the deflected side. When both strakes were deflected differentially, two forebody/strake vortices were present. The forebody/strake vortex from the larger deflection would lift from the surface while the other would remain close to the surface.

50|$|Since {{the output}} {{pressure}} of a centrifugal pump {{varies with the}} square of the speed, pressure can be controlled accurately by controlling the speed of the pump. For example: a pump runs at 1785 RPM during shutoff with an output pressure of 204 PSI and a <b>suction</b> <b>pressure</b> of 0 PSI. If the speed of the motor is reduced by 10% to 1607 RPM, the new output pressure becomes 165 PSI. This in turn enables the Variable Speed Controller to maintain a perfectly flat pump discharge curve until the full rating of the pump is reached. Further, the variable speed controller adjusts for varying <b>suction</b> <b>pressure</b> - as in the following example: a city water supply of 65 PSI drops to 26 PSI while flowing. The variable speed drive will speed up to adjust for the sudden drop in pressure and slow down again when it is not needed - all the while maintaining a constant total discharge pressure.|$|E

The difference between diffusion pressure of pure water and solution is called diffusion pressure deficit (DPD). [...] When a plant cell is placed in hypotonic solution, water enters into a cell by osmosis and as a result turger pressure develops. The cell membrane get stretched and osmotic pressure of cell decreases. As cell absorbs more and more water its Total Pressure increases and Osmotic Pressure decreases. When a cell is fully turgid, its OP is equal to TP and DPD is zero. Turgid cells cannot absorb any more water. Thus, with reference to plant cell, the DPD can be described as actual thirst of cell for water and can be expressed as DPD=OP-TP.|$|E

40|$|Twin {{screw pumps}} (TSPs) are {{commonly}} used for multiphase boosting systems to enhance oil and gas production. TSPs are a positive displacement pump that can efficiently handle fluids {{with a wide range}} of gas volume fractions (GVFs). The present study has developed a model to predict the performance of TSPs for varying GVFs, pump speeds, <b>suction</b> <b>pressures,</b> and differential pressures. A two-phase compressible flow model is used to determine the rate of leakage backflow through clearances within the pump. The model incorporates the possibility of choking due to sonic flow. Hydraulic imbalances cause rotor deflection, and the model accounts for increased leakage flowrates due to the induced eccentric rotation. The model was validated with experimental data from a Colfax MR- 200 TSP, and there is good agreement in most test cases. However, cases with low speeds and high differential pressures were not as reliable. This may be due to uncertainty of the rates of gas infiltration into the clearances at low pump speeds. The study reveals that pump performance is generally better when operating at high pump speeds, high GVF, low <b>suction</b> <b>pressures,</b> or low differential pressures. Linear pressure distributions throughout the pump?s chambers generally indicate lower volumetric efficiency compared to steep, concave pressure distributions. The effects of rotor deflection are generally small, but in a few cases they should not be ignored.
