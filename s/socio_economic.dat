25|$|A {{positive}} correlation between minorities and a <b>socio</b> <b>economic</b> status of being low income in industrialized and rural regions of the U.S. depict how low income communities tend to include more individuals that have a lower educational background, most importantly in health. Income status, diet, and education all construct a higher burden for low income minorities, to be conscious about their health. Research conducted by medical departments at universities in San diego, Miami, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina suggested that minorities in regions where lower socioeconomic status is common, there was a direct relationship with unhealthy diets and greater distance of supermarkets. Therefore, in areas where supermarkets are less accessible (food deserts) to impoverished areas, the more likely these groups are to purchase inexpensive fast food or just follow an unhealthy diet. As a result, because food deserts are more prevalent in low income communities, minorities that reside in these areas are more prone obesity, {{which can lead to}} diseases such as chronic kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes.|$|E

These developments have implications to physical and <b>socio</b> - <b>economic</b> developments as well as cultural aspects of cities in Malaysia. This {{is especially true for}} Iskandar Malaysia (IM), a new corridor development envisioned to be a “sustainable conurbation of international standing‟. The whole initiatives targeted an enormous increase in <b>socio</b> - <b>economic</b> development indicators such as populations (222 %), workforce (233 %), and per - capit a GDP (210 %) during a 20 - year period of 2005 - 2025.

40|$|ABSTRACT Civil {{engineering}} projects often present adverse socio-economic impacts {{in their}} immediate environments. As such a proper {{balance between the}} benefits expected from the project and the social costs can only be obtained through impact studies. The paper uses a combination of primary and secondary data sources to assess the socio-economic impact of the project in quantitative terms and to relate the <b>socio</b> – <b>economic</b> variables investigated to the mitigation measures adopted. A total of 13 <b>socio</b> – <b>economic</b> variables were investigated and analyzed using quantitative techniques. The study broadly showed {{a positive impact on}} the economic variables. The only exception was damage done to agricultural lands and crops during the construction phase. It also revealed that social variables had both negative and positive impacts. It attributes the positive impacts of the project to the early and extensive implementation of impact mitigation measures in order to avoid potentially significant adverse impacts. In conclusion, most of the <b>socio</b> – <b>economic</b> impacts were, therefore, positive. The study recommends periodic reviews and monitoring of the commitments of the various parties to the project {{in order to ensure that}} these are implemented. These should be in line and within the time scale of social impact (SIA) and environmental impact assessment (EIA). Such studies go beyond the “impact fixation ” to address the causes of unsustainable development...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an application of}} recently developed qualitative reasoning techniques to complex, <b>socio</b> [...] <b>economic</b> allocation problems. We explain why we believe traditional optimization methods are inappropriate and how qualitative reasoning could overcome some of these shortcomings. A case study is presented where an authority is expected to devise a policy that satisfies certain constraints. We describe how sets of rules of thumb implementing such a policy can be analyzed and validated by the decision maker using a program which automatically builds and simulates qualitative models of the underlying dynamical system. Such a program constructs and simulates models from incomplete descriptions of initial states and functional relationships between variables. We show that it nevertheless gives sufficient information to the decision maker. 1 Introduction National and international authorities must make difficult policy decisions regarding <b>socio</b> [...] <b>economic</b> problems which are complex, [...] ...|$|R
