500|$|Some {{responded to}} the {{backlash}} {{in a show of}} solidarity with Davuluri. Students at Duke University, and with Yale University's Asian American Cultural Center and the South Asian Society, created videos and ran photo campaigns denouncing the social media attacks, while Miss Kansas Theresa Vail blogged and gave interviews to discredit the comments about both herself and Davuluri. Actor and civil-rights activist George Takei (the original Hikaru Sulu in [...] ) posted a comment on Facebook stating that while he normally doesn't [...] "care about Miss America … the uproar over an Indian-American winning (whom many decried for being 'Arab') has me <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Please tell me I'm not alone in wondering whether we've learned anything at all." [...] University of Michigan student Munmun Khan also stated that while she doesn't like beauty pageants, she hates [...] "racism and bigotry even more [...] Not only was [...] the first Indian Miss New York, but she is now also the first Indian Miss America. All cause for celebration." [...] Finally, Immediate Past President, Young Democrats of America, Atima Omara, argued that [...] "a sexist, racist, xenophobic attack against one prominent woman of color is an attack against us all, and it shouldn't be tolerated just because we disdain that woman's choices. As an African-American woman with an ethnic name, I know the constant sting that comes from hearing how you are not American enough {{no matter how much you}} accomplish in the name of America." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1902, the Giants sent catcher Frank Bowerman {{to persuade}} Taylor {{to return to}} the Giants. [...] Bowerman sat in the stands while Taylor was {{pitching}} and negotiated the terms of Taylor's return to the Giants by signing. Taylor recalled: Frank sat in the grandstand and every time I walked out to the pitching mound he kept talking to me with his fingers. I kept <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> [...] "No", and Frank kept boosting the money. Soon, I nodded my head [...] "Yes", and that night I was on my way back to New York with Frank.|$|E
2500|$|As Tommy {{walked back}} to his corner after shaking Louis' hand, I {{followed}} him and seized his glove. [...] "Tommy, a wonderful perform—" [...] I began... Then I dropped his hand like a red-hot coal! He had started to raise his arm. He thought I {{had given him the}} fight and the world championship! I literally ran away, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and shouting. [...] "No! No! No!" [...] realising how I had raised his hopes for a few seconds only to dash them to the ground... That's the last time my emotions will get the better of me in a prize fight! There was much booing at the announced result, but, as I say it, it was all emotional. I gave Tommy two rounds and one even—and both his winning rounds were close.|$|E
3000|$|... “I have {{stones in}} my brain, haven’t I?…just like stones in tofu (soybean curd). If I <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> strongly, moving stones would damage the tofu…Then I always {{try not to}} <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> in <b>my</b> life.” (M 4) [...]...|$|R
50|$|I {{will not}} <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> about when going in {{inhabited}} areas.|$|R
60|$|Again I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> whereat {{he looked}} more {{disappointed}} than before.|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} the solicitude which his face expressed, by conveying the same expression into my own, and <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Then if you'll {{excuse the}} freedom, Mr. Chops," [...] were my remark, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> grave, [...] "I think it's a pity you ever went in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, never now," [...] I said, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "He has {{forgotten}} all about me, I dare say. Or if he hasn't, he has never forgiven me." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{released}} her long emaciated hand, <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> negatively, and sat down.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> feebly, for I was {{longing to}} accept his offer.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> though I guessed {{well enough}} what night he meant.|$|R
6000|$|I removed them gently, {{returned}} them, {{and walked}} away, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and smiling {{a smile of}} silly embarrassment while the passers-by halted to observe. The woman leaned out of her door, shook the beads, and screamed after me: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} I {{would do if}} I were the last horse. Whenever I wanted to stop and rest I would keep <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> all the time, and {{that would make the}} driver think that I was coming along.|$|E
6000|$|... "Impossible," [...] I answered, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "It belongs {{as clear}} as day to the man {{you see in the}} photograph. How on earth could his hand be a woman's then, I'd like to know? I can see the shirt-cuff." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> blankly, for I {{had never}} heard {{anything}} of the sort.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> in sorrow, a {{thrust of}} jealousy cutting me the while.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> {{with all}} <b>my</b> flush of joy changed to foolish resentment.|$|R
6000|$|I {{followed}} him {{on to the}} open deck. [...] "It is quite impossible, my dear sir," [...] I said, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> austerely, for I divined his errand. [...] "I can't go and see Lady Meadowcroft. Medical etiquette, you know; the constant and salutary rule of the profession!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{not all of}} it? Why {{sure you}} don't mean to say, Pip, {{that there was no}} black welwet co--ch?" [...] For, I stood <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "But at least there was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip," [...] said Joe, persuasively, [...] "if there warn't no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{getting into}} too deep waters for me, Mary," [...] I said, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "I'm not an {{authority}} on telepathy, or whatever you call it. But I've no belief in such theories. In fact, I think they are all nonsense. I'm sure you must think so too in your rational moments." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} its great black hole yawned close, but I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R

60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and {{dismissed}} him. After {{a very brief}} toilet I hastened downstairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "South Sea cyclone of {{the worst}} breed," [...] he replied. [...] "That cursed Dane {{knew it was coming}} and that's why he left the ship. Pray as you never prayed before," [...] and again he {{stretched}} out his hand towards the whisky bottle. But I stepped between him and it, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Thereon he laughed for the third time and left the cabin. Though I saw him once or twice afterwards, these were really the last words of intelligible conversation that I ever had with Captain Astley.|$|E
6000|$|I {{wondered}} greatly at my fat little financier's civility to that dubious personage when {{he asked}} me, as we resumed our respective seats, whether I knew who it was that had just gone out. On my <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> negatively he smiled queerly, said [...] "De Barral," [...] and enjoyed my surprise. Then becoming grave: [...] "That's a deep fellow, if you like. We all know where he started from and where he got to; but nobody knows what he means to do." [...] He became thoughtful {{for a moment and}} added as if speaking to himself, [...] "I wonder what his game is." ...|$|E
6000|$|This thing, {{for very}} obvious reasons, I found it quite {{impossible}} to do. In the first place, {{my left arm}} had been broken in my fall from the ladder, and, therefore, had I let go my hold with the right hand, I must have let go altogether. In the second place, I could have no breeches until I came across the crow. I was therefore obliged, much to my regret, to shake {{my head in the}} negative--intending thus to give the Angel to understand that I found it inconvenient, just at that moment, to comply with his very reasonable demand! No sooner, however, had I ceased <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> than-- ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{and felt}} myself {{swelling}} with the inarticulate hate that possessed me.|$|R
60|$|Again I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and for {{the life}} of me I could say nothing.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> blankly, whereat they murmured {{together}} and made {{as though they}} would go.|$|R
6000|$|I {{could not}} forbear <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and smiling {{a little at}} his ignorance. And being no {{stranger}} to the art of war, I gave him a description of cannons, culverins, muskets, carabines, pistols, bullets, powder, swords, bayonets, battles, sieges, retreats, attacks, undermines, countermines, bombardments, sea fights, ships sunk with a thousand men, twenty thousand killed on each side, dying groans, limbs flying in the air, smoke, noise, confusion, trampling to death under horses’ feet, flight, pursuit, victory; fields strewed with carcases, left for food to dogs and wolves and birds of prey; plundering, stripping, ravishing, burning, and destroying. And to set forth the valour of my own dear countrymen, I assured him, “that I had seen them blow up a hundred enemies at once in a siege, and as many in a ship, and beheld the dead bodies drop down in pieces from the clouds, to the great diversion of the spectators.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... [p.172] replied by <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> His {{question}} being {{interpreted to}} me in Arabic, I drawled out, “My native place {{is the land of}} Khorasan.” This provoked a stern and stony stare from the Turks, and an “ugh!” which said plainly enough, “Then you are a pestilent heretic.” I surveyed them with a self-satisfied simper, stretched my legs a trifle farther, and conversed with my water-pipe. Presently, when they all departed for a time, the boy Mohammed raised, by request, my green box of medicines, and deposited it upon the Mastabah; thus defining, as it were, a line of demarcation, and asserting my privilege to it before the Turks. Most of these men were of one party, headed by a colonel of Nizam, whom they called a Bey. My acquaintance with them began roughly enough, but afterwards, with some exceptions, who were gruff as an English butcher when accosted by a lean foreigner, they proved to be kind-hearted and not unsociable men. It often happens to the traveller, as the charming Mrs. Malaprop observes, to find intercourse all the better by beginning with a little aversion.|$|E
6000|$|I confess when he {{said this}} it made all the blood turn in my veins, and I thought I should have fainted. [...] "Poor gentleman," [...] thought I, [...] "you know little of me. What would I give to be really what you really think me to be!" [...] He {{perceived}} the disorder, but said nothing till I spoke; when, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> [...] "Oh, sir!" [...] said I, [...] "death in any shape has some terror in it, but in the frightful figure of a storm at sea and a sinking ship, {{it comes with a}} double, a treble, and indeed an inexpressible horror; and if I were that saint you think me to be (which God knows I am not), it is still very dismal. I desire to die in a calm, if I can." [...] He said a great many good things, and very prettily ordered his discourse between serious reflection and compliment, but I had too much guilt to relish it as it was meant, so I turned it off to something else, and talked of the necessity I had on me to come to Holland, but I wished myself safe on shore in England again.|$|E
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> emphatically, {{guessing}} that I {{was to be}} seat {{on another}} proud mission.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked}} at him. His head had dropped down on his chest again.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Some {{instinct}} told me {{that they}} were professors. But I didn't say so.|$|R
