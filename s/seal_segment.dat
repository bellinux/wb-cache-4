40|$|An {{experimental}} and analytical investigation is presented of contact phenomena {{for the case}} of a fully-dense copper gas path <b>seal</b> <b>segment</b> which is rubbed by a single steel blade tip at room temperature. The experiments were executed on a pendulum-type test device, with forces, rub energy, surface temperature and residual deformation being determined for each single-path rub test. The thermal and mechanical factors influencing single-pass rub surface temperatures were modeled analytically. It is found that large plastic strains occurred on or near the contact surface of the copper rub specimens. A study of the influence of various material properties on surface temperature showed that increased thermal conductivity of the stationary component played a role in lowering contact temperatures. Increased thermal conductivity of the moving blade tip component and increased thermal diffusivity of the stationary material also had a beneficial effect...|$|E

Design concepts for the attachment of the CMC component {{to the metal}} structure of the gas turbine are developed in a first work stream focused on the combustion chamber and the turbine <b>seal</b> <b>segment.</b> Issues like environmental barrier coating (EBC) /thermal barrier coatings (TBC), application and volatilization, allowance for the different thermal expansion and the mechanical fixation are addressed. The design work is accompanied by CFD and FEM simulations. A variation of the microstructural design of the three oxide/oxide CMC materials in terms of different fiber architecture and processing of matrix are considered. Also, mechanical properties of these variations are evaluated. The CMCs are tested in various loading modes (tension, compression, shear, off-axis loading) from room temperature to maximum application temperature. By modification of the matrix and the fiber-matrix interface as well as EBC coatings, the high temperature stability and the insulation performance are enhanced.

The geometry of the steam turbine seals changes throughout the machine life cycle. The rate of deterioration of these seals, in turn, affects heavily {{the efficiency of the}} thermal machine. However, the literature overview does not provide any research reports on flow phenomena occurring in heavily deteriorated seals. The paper describes the course and results of investigations into a model straight through labyrinth seal composed of 4 discs, each with the slot height of 2 mm. The investigations have been conducted with air as the working medium. Changes of gas flow parameters due to wear were analysed. Based on the experimental data, more intensive leakage was observed {{as the result of the}} increased slot height. The static pressure distribution along the examined segment was measured. The experimentally recorded distribution differed remarkably from the theoretical assumptions. Another part of the experimental research focused on comparing the gas velocities at points situated upstream of the first and second seal disc. The velocity measurements were carried out using a constant temperature wire probe. This part of the investigations provided opportunities for analysing the influence of seal wear on gas flow conditions in the <b>seal</b> <b>segment.</b> The paper compares the results of the experimental research with those obtained using the CFX software. The presented results of velocity distributions provide a clear picture of the nature of the gas flow in the seal, which enables its analysis...|$|E
40|$|A thermal tip {{clearance}} control system provides a robust and flexible means of manipulating the closure between the casing and the rotating blade tips in a jet engine, reducing undesirable tip leakage flows. This may be achieved using an impingement cooling scheme on the external casing of the engine in conjunction with careful thermal management of internal over-tip <b>seal</b> <b>segment</b> cavity. For a reduction in thrust specific fuel consumption, the mass flow rate of air used for cooling must be minimised, be at as low a pressure as possible and delivered through a light weight structure surrounding the rotating components in the turbine. This thesis first characterises {{the effectiveness of a}} range of external impingement cooling arrangements in typical engine casing closure system. The effects of jet-to-jet pitch, number of jets, inline and staggered alignment of jets, arrays of jets on flange, on an engine representative casing geometry are assessed through comparison of the convective heat transfer coefficient distributions in a series of numerical studies. A baseline case is validated experimentally. The validation data allowed the suitability of different turbulence closure models to be assessed using a commercial RANS solver. Importantly for each configuration the thermal contraction of an idealised engine casing is predicted using thermo-mechanical finite element models, at a series of operating conditions representing engine idle to maximum take-off conditions. Cooling is provided by manifolds attached to the outside of the engine. The assembly tolerance of these components leads to variation in the standoff distance between the manifold and the casing. For cooling arrangements with promising performance, the study is extended to characterise the variation in closure with standoff distance. It is shown that where a sparse array of non-interacting jets is used the system can be made tolerant of large build misalignments. The casing geometry itself contributes to the thermal response of the system, and, in an additional study, the effect of casing thickness and circumferential thermal control flanges are investigated. Restriction of the passage of heat into the flanges was seen to be dramatically change their effectiveness and slight necking of the flanges at their root was shown to improve the performance disproportionally. High temperature secondary air flowing past the internal face of the engine casing tends to heat the casing, causing it to grow. Experimental and numerical characterisation of a heat transfer within a typical over-tip segment cavity heat transfer is presented in this thesis for the first time. A simplified modelling strategy is proposed for casing and a means to reduce the casing heat pickup by up to 25 % was identified. The overall validity of the modelling approach used is difficult to validate in the engine environment, however limited data from a test engine temperature survey became available {{during the course of the}} research. By modelling this engine {{tip clearance}} control system it was shown that good agreement to the temperature distribution in the engine casing could be achieved where full surface external heat transfer coefficient boundary conditions were available. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{daily life}} sound {{is a vital}} {{dimension}} for {{the perception of the}} world around us but can in some cases be considered as annoying, irritating, or even harmful. In these cases the sound is labelled as noise and can be addressed in two ways, either by insulating the noise problem from the receiver (person) or by altering the source. The work performed in this thesis has been focusing on the latter approach. To be able to alter the source, knowledge about the physical properties governing the sound generation process is essential. Advanced measurement and modelling methods have been applied in the study of two different cases of noise generation. Milling machine noise: The first study addressed sound generating vibrations in milling machine operations which are a common operation in e. g. the automotive and aerospace industry. Large metal work pieces are reduced to a fraction of their original weight when creating complex thin structures. During these operations it is important that unwanted behaviours such as excessive tool vibrations (chatter) can be avoided. Chatter causes poor surface finish and/or material damage and can expose machine operators to annoying and/or harmful noise levels. In order to predict process parameters for a chatter-free milling operation, knowledge of the properties of the dynamic system are essential. To improve the possibility of measuring milling machine tool vibrations or any other rotor vibration with a high accuracy a method for single beam Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) measurements on rotating spindles was developed. The method solved two major problems using LDV on rotating targets, speckle noise and cross talk. To analyse the dynamic response of a rotor and its speed dependency, a method based on inductive displacement measurement, electromagnetic excitation, and FEM was developed. The measured dynamic response and the simulations of the studied milling machine, revealed the ball bearings as the weakest link capable of causing chatter vibrations and noise at high rotational speeds. Friction induced noise: The second study addressed problems regarding annoying sound generating vibrations in car door sealing systems and how these could be predicted and simulated for future car models. In the design process of a car door weather strip seals different conditions and demands must be considered. The primary goal of the seal is to act like a flexible barrier and protect the door/frame joint. The seal should prevent e. g. water and dust from entering the compartment and insulate the compartment from temperature and sound pressure differences between the two sides. Different types of seal geometries and rubber material can be used to achieve this. The seal stiffness affects the dynamic behaviour of the door and could result in squeak and rattle problems if not designed correctly. Relative displacement between the door and the seals can also be a source to squeaking noise. A common problem in winter conditions at sub-zero temperatures is when humidity on the seal surface freezes and cause the seal to stick to the door, with the risk of ripping the seal when the door is opened. In order to avoid this, different kinds of consumer lubrication products {{can be applied to the}} seal surface. By doing this the contact conditions between the door and the seal will change. To analyse the affect of different contact conditions and relative displacement, measurements and simulations of a <b>seal</b> <b>segment</b> compressed by a metal plate have been performed. The study showed that different contact conditions can affect the desired seal function by altering the resulting seal shape during compression, and that the energy relaxation is an important aspect when establishing the long term stiffness. A stick-slip phenomenon generating audible sound was generated by translating a metal plate along a car door seal. A difference, governed by the surface properties of the rough metal plate, between the static and the kinetic friction allowed the seal to stick to the translating surface and release its charged elastic energy in a sliding repelling motion creating an audible sound pulse. The frequency of this stick-slip oscillation was found to be linearly dependent on the plate speed and the static friction was found to be dependent on the plate speed. FEM simulations confirmed that a difference between the static and the kinetic friction could result in a stick-slip vibration.

40|$|An {{important}} parameter for turbomachinery designers is “clearance control”, {{because the}} clearances between interfaces must {{be set to}} optimum values to maximize power output, operational life and efficiency. Leakage of hot gas result- ing from excessive clearance, can lead to flow instabilities, components overheat- ing, lower cycle efficiency and {{a dramatic increase in}} specific fuel consumption (SFC). <b>Seal</b> <b>segments</b> are used to reduce blade tip leakage, maintain coolant air flow and the stability of rotor-dynamic systems, helping to maximize blade perfor- mance. <b>Seal</b> <b>segments</b> in the High-Pressure Turbine (HPT) stages are one of the hottest components as they face the hot gases coming from the combustion chamber with temperatures which can reach 1700 [*] 0 C and which makes them sub- ject to oxidation, erosion, and creep. Thus, <b>seal</b> <b>segments</b> need to be protected. They are currently cooled using jet impingement techniques, passing cooling air (supplied by the high-pressure stage of the compressor) through channels to di- rectly impinge on the hot surfaces. The focus of this research was to improve the jet impingement cooling of the <b>seal</b> <b>segments</b> in HPTs by investigating methods that provide more effective heat removal. The role played by configurations of ribs (surface roughness using be- spoke turbulators), custom-made seal-segments, and surface features such as contouring, both in isolation and combination, were investigated using numerical methods. A set of 174 simulations were carried including the use of uniform and non-uniform roughness elements with different shapes and heights. Firstly, three different uniform roughness elements were tested, a square cross-sectional continuous rib, a hemi-spherical pin-fin and a cubical pin-fin for three jet impingement angles of α= 90 °, 60 ° and 45 °. Each roughness element was also tested for six different heights (e) between 0. 25 mm and 1. 5 mm in increments of 0. 25 mm. Results are presented in the form of average Nusselt number within and beyond the stagnation region. Secondly, the effect of using a roughness element with a square cross section {{in the shape of a}} circle, on the average Nu was investigated for four different radial locations (R), three jet angles (α) and six rib heights (e). Finally, the roughness element used was continuous, of square cross-sec- tion, in the shape of tear drops and reversed tear drops.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{significant}} efforts {{have been made to}} introduce film riding sealing technology on large industrial or aerospace gas turbines. The main challenge comes from the high surface speeds and high temperatures, which lead to large thermal distortions. One approach to tackle the effect of thermally induced distortion is to design a seal to operate at a large film to limit the viscous heat generation. To design a seal pad that maximizes force at relatively high film heights, it is important to select the seal groove type that looks the most promising to deliver this characteristic. Several groove types have been assessed as part of this study. The most promising groove type is the Rayleigh step, which gives the strongest level of combined hydrostatic and hydrodynamic load support while also being easier to tessellate on individual <b>seal</b> <b>segments.</b> The results generated using a uniform grid Reynolds equation method show reasonable agreement with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations.

The concretes are intended for <b>sealing</b> <b>segments</b> of deep boreholes and have a small amount of cement for minimizing the mutual chemical impact on the contacting clay seals. The composition is examined by application of packing theory with respect to the cement/aggregate ratio and the gradation of the aggregate material which is crushed quartzite for providing high internal friction after maturation, as well as to talc added for fluidity and to the small amount of cement. Low porosity and micro-structural stability must be guaranteed for very long periods of time. The study exemplifies how packing theory assist designers in selecting optimal proportions of the various components. Optimum particle packing implies minimizing the porosity and thereby reducing the amount of cement paste needed to fill the voids between the aggregate particles.

The study goals were to evaluate the safety and preliminary effectiveness of the device and refine patient selection criteria. MethodsFive centers in the United States enrolled 30 patients with juxtarenal aortic aneurysms with ≥ 50 -mm diameter and short proximal necks. Devices were custom-designed for each patient based on measurements from reconstructed computed tomography (CT) data. Follow-up studies included physical examinations, laboratory studies, CT imaging, mesenteric-renal duplex ultrasound imaging, and abdominal flat plate radiographs at hospital discharge, at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter up to 5 years. ResultsDuring a 1 -year period, 30 patients (80 % men; mean age, 75 years) with a mean aneurysm size of 61. 4 mm were enrolled. In these 30 patients, 77 visceral vessels were accommodated by fenestrations located within the <b>sealing</b> <b>segment</b> of the grafts. The most common design accommodated two renal arteries and the superior mesenteric artery (66. 7 %). All prostheses were implanted successfully. No visceral arteries were lost. Of the 30 patients treated, 27 were available for 12 -month follow-up and 23 were available for 24 -month follow-up. No aneurysm-related deaths, aneurysm ruptures, or conversions were observed through 24 months of follow-up. No type I or type III endoleaks were observed. Type II endoleaks were noted in six (26. 1 %) at 12 months and four (20. 0 %) at 24 months. No patients had aneurysm growth > 5 mm. Aneurysm size decreased in 16 of 23 (69. 6 %) and was stable in the remaining patients at 24 months. Eight patients experienced a renal event (4 renal artery stenoses, 2 renal artery occlusions, and 2 renal infarcts). Five underwent secondary interventions. No renal failure developed requiring dialysis. ConclusionsThe intermediate-term (24 -month) results of the 30 patients in this multicenter study are concordant with previous single-center studies and support the concept that placement of fenestrated endovascular grafts is safe and effective at centers with experience in endovascular repair and renal/mesenteric stent placement...|$|R

Fluid and HCO 3 − secretion were estimated by monitoring luminal pH and luminal volume in <b>sealed</b> duct <b>segments</b> microinjected with BCECF-dextran. Both ATP and UTP (1 μm) caused biphasic increases in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration in pancreatic duct cells when applied to either the basolateral or luminal membrane.

By contrast, basolateral application of ATP or UTP inhibited spontaneous secretion by 52 % and 73 %, respectively, and secretin-evoked secretion by 41 % and 38 %, respectively. The data suggest that luminal nucleotides may act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to enhance ductal secretion while basolateral nucleotides, perhaps released from nerve terminals, may have an inhibitory effect.

The preliminary design of a mechanically actuated active clearance control (ACC) system for turbine blade tip clearance management is presented along with {{the design of a}} bench top test rig in which the system is to be evaluated. The ACC system utilizes mechanically actuated <b>seal</b> carrier <b>segments</b> and clearance measurement feedback to provide fast and precise active clearance control throughout engine operation.

The recovery of bottom and interstitial waters depends on the attainment of two objectives: (1) a segment of the bottom water and bottom sediment with interstitial water must be ob-tained inside a sealed core-liner tube so that these waters do not mix with overlying water during core retrieval; and (2) water samples must be removed from the liner tube without disturbing their relative vertical positions.

The second method involves using the existing CNN trained for image classification as a means to extract features from seal images which are then used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Both methods are implemented, tested and compared. Both approaches show good results with total accuracy of 91. 2 % for CNN and 90. 5 % for SVM...|$|R
5|$|The highway {{was created}} in the 1930s from an {{existing}} system of roads linking Perth with the Goldfields. Though the name Great Eastern Highway was coined to describe the route from Perth to Guildford on the northern side of the Swan River (modern-day Guildford Road), it was actually used for the road through Belmont, south of the river. This section was constructed in 1867 using convict labour, with the road base made from sections of tree trunks. Over the years the road has been upgraded, with the whole highway <b>sealed</b> by 1953, <b>segments</b> reconstructed and widened, dual carriageways created in Perth and Kalgoorlie, and grade separated interchanges built at major intersections. Great Eastern Highway Bypass in Perth's eastern suburbs opened in 1988, allowing through traffic to avoid the Guildford and Midland townsites, and in 2002 a new bypass diverted the highway around Northam. A future route to replace Great Eastern Highway's current ascent of the Darling Scarp has been identified. The planned route is a controlled-access highway along Toodyay Road to Gidgegannup, and then across to Wundowie via a new alignment. Though planning began in the 1970s, , construction of this route has not been scheduled, and it is not considered a priority.|$|R
40|$|Turbine {{shaft seals}} are {{vulnerable}} to rubs caused by thermal distortion, mis-alignment and rotor dynamic vibration that are often not well understood. When seals rub as a machine is brought up to operating conditions performance is compromised due to increased seal leakage. Much effort has been extended {{in recent years to}} develop seals that mitigate those losses. This paper presents a <b>seal</b> design with <b>segmented</b> film riding runners capable of non-contacting seal operation during rotor transients. Operating differential seal pressure displaces seal leaves and attached runners toward the rotor surface until balanced by hydrostatic and hydrodynamic lift. Sufficient radial range of operation is provided to follow the rotor seal surface during transients while maintaining a small seal clearance. Seal design features and function will be described and illustrated along with analysis of forces and motions for a sample application. Planned modeling and testing will also be presented. This concept promises enhanced shaft sealing by combining a leaf seal structure that provides a large range of motion to avoid rubs during startup and shutdown with runner elements capable of generating hydrostatic and hydrodynamic lift forces to maintain shaft- seal separation during all rotor displacement transients. Improved turbine performance from small operating seal clearance and extended seal life without rubs are expected benefits of the Film Riding Pressure Actuated Leaf Seal (FRPALS) ...|$|R
40|$|The seismic {{vulnerability}} assessment of tunnels is generally based on empirical fragility curves. They {{are derived from}} the statistical analysis of observed damages in past earthquakes. Some authors have calculated fragility curves {{based on the results}} of numerical analyses, defining the damage index in terms of ratio between the flexural demand and capacity of the structural section of the tunnel lining. However, the tunnel lining is generally assumed as a continuous ring, while in the case of mechanized tunneling it is made of jointed segments. Recent studies modeling with FEA the non-linear dynamic interaction between the segmental lining and the soil have shown the significant effect of the jointed pattern of a segmental lining. On one hand, it implies a lower structural demand than a continuous ring, due to its larger flexibility and compressibility in the transverse section; on the other hand, permanent rotations of the joints are often calculated at the end of the earthquake, that may represent a further structural fragility of a segmental lining, since they may produce dislocation of <b>sealing</b> gaskets among <b>segments.</b> Limited available post-earthquake reconnaissance, would seem to indicate that in some cases damage at the segments joints has been observed. In this study, a set of FEA was carried out using a strain hardening elastic-plastic model with small strain overlay. Several input signals were used and different ground conditions were modelled in order to define fragility curves for damage associated to joint permanent rotation in a segmental tunnel lining. The results are presented and discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Strip seals {{are used}} in gas turbine engines between two static {{elements}} or between components which do not move relative to each other, such as Nozzle Guide Vanes (NGVs). The key role of a strip <b>seal</b> between NGV <b>segments</b> is <b>sealing</b> between the flow through the main stream annulus and the internal air system and to limit inter-segmental movements. In general {{the shape of the}} strip seal is a rectangular strip that fits into two slots in adjacent components. The minimum clearance required for static strip seals must be found by accounting for thermal expansion, misalignment, and application, to allow correct fitment of the strip seals. Any increase in leakage raises the cost due to an increase in the cooling air use, which is linked to specific fuel consumption, and it can also alter gas flow paths and performance. The narrow path within the seal assembly, especially the height has the most significant affect on leakage. The height range of the narrow path studied in this paper is 0. 01 0. 06 mm. The behaviour of the flow passing through the narrow path has been studied using CFD modelling and measurements in a bespoke rig. The CFD and experimental results show that normalized leakage flow increases with pressure ratio before reaching a maximum. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} provide new experimental data to verify the CFD modelling for static strip seals. The typical flow characteristics validated by CFD modelling and experiments can be used to predict the flow behaviour for future static strip seal designs...|$|R
40|$|The high {{temperature}} conversion (HTC) technique using an elemental analyzer with a glassy carbon tube and filling (temperature conversion/elemental analysis, TC/EA) {{is a widely}} used method for hydrogen isotopic analysis of water and many solid and liquid organic samples with analysis by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). However, the TC/EA IRMS method may produce inaccurate delta H- 2 results, with values deviating by more than 20 mUr (milliurey = 0. 001 = 1 parts per thousand) from the true value for some materials. We show that a single-oven, chromium-filled elemental analyzer coupled to an IRMS substantially improves the measurement quality and reliability for hydrogen isotopic compositions of organic substances (Cr-EA method). Hot chromium maximizes the yield of molecular hydrogen in a helium carrier gas by irreversibly and quantitatively scavenging all reactive elements except hydrogen. In contrast, under TC/EA conditions, heteroelements like nitrogen or chlorine (and other halogens) can form hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or hydrogen chloride (HCl) and this can cause isotopic fractionation. The Cr-EA technique thus expands the analytical possibilities for on-line hydrogen-isotope measurements of organic samples significantly. This method yielded reproducibility values (1 -sigma) for delta H- 2 measurements on water and caffeine samples of better than 1. 0 and 0. 5 mUr, respectively. To overcome handling problems with water as the principal calibration anchor for hydrogen isotopic measurements, we have employed an effective and simple strategy using reference waters or other liquids <b>sealed</b> in silver-tube <b>segments.</b> These crimped silver tubes can be employed in both the Cr-EA and TC/EA techniques. They simplify considerably the normalization of hydrogen-isotope measurement data to the VSMOW-SLAP (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water-Standard Light Antarctic Precipitation) scale, and their use improves accuracy of the data by eliminating evaporative loss and associated isotopic fractionation while handling water as a bulk sample. The calibration of organic samples, commonly having high delta H- 2 values, {{will benefit from the}} availability of suitably H- 2 -enriched reference waters, extending the VSMOW-SLAP scale above zero...|$|R
40|$|Ductile iron (DI) pipes {{have been}} used for the {{conveyance}} of drinking water in drinking water distribution systems over the past several decades. It has been estimated that almost half of all new water mains installed in North America are DI pipes. Although DI pipe itself is resistant to chemical permeation, the polymeric gaskets that join and <b>seal</b> the pipe <b>segments</b> are reported to be susceptible to permeation by organic contaminants. Pipe-drum, diffusion cell experiments, and numerical simulations were conducted in this research to obtain a faster mean to evaluate possible permeations through DI gaskets. Of the five types of gasket materials tested using the gravimetric sorption test, ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) had the highest sorption of gasoline, while fluoroelastomer rubber (FKM) exhibited very low sorption of gasoline. The sorption test results suggested that the least to most resistance to permeation of premium gasoline for the five gasket materials were EPDM, styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), chloroprene rubber (CR; neoprene), acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), and FKM. A typical gasket was found to be made of two portions, the heel and the bulb, of the same polymer but different formulation. Gravimetric sorption tests suggested that the heel portion of all gaskets may be more resistant to permeation than the bulb making it the limiting step for permeation of organic compounds in gasoline. Pipe-drum experiments showed that SBR gasket had the highest permeation rates of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), followed by CR, EPDM, and NBR. With regards to threats to drinking water under water stagnation conditions in the pipe, the 5 μg/L maximum contaminant level (MCL) for benzene will likely be exceeded during an 8 -hour stagnation period for SBR gaskets in contact with free-product premium gasoline. NBR gaskets were found to be sufficiently resistant to permeation by benzene or other BTEX compounds in gasoline and the benzene concentration is unlikely to exceed EPA MCLs. Assessment based on data from the pipe-drum experiments suggested that when there is flow of water in the pipe, benzene and other BTEX compounds in gasoline will not exceed EPA MCLs. A diffusion cell device was developed to obtain diffusion coefficients of BTEX compounds for various gasket materials under controlled conditions. Using curve fitting of the permeation data by numerical modeling, the diffusion coefficients of BTEX compounds through SBR and NBR gasket materials was found to range from 10 - 7 to 10 - 8 cm 2 /s. The steady-state permeation rates were found to correlate in a linear relationship with thickness while the diffusion coefficients were found to be invariable to the thickness of the polymer tested (2 mm to 5 mm). The diffusion cell provided a rapid, inexpensive, and relatively well-controlled means to study permeation of polymeric gasket materials for DI pipes and the data obtained were used to model benzene permeation of the pipe-drum experiments. The permeation of benzene through a 4 -inch SBR gasket of a pipe joint was modeled using Multiphysics diffusion module. The simulations showed that the heel portions as well as part of the bulb portions of a gasket were likely to be in contact with the contaminants. Model simulation predicted that a 4 -inch SBR gasket under hydrostatic pressure would permeate more organic chemicals than a pipe without hydrostatic pressure, posing greater risk to organic chemical permeations. Increase in the length/size of the bulb portion of a 4 -inch SBR gasket by compression or swelling from 10 % to 30 %, reduced the permeated mass of benzene by about 29 % to 71 % within 150 days of exposure to gasoline. In summary, SBR and NBR gaskets are compatible with any level of gasoline contamination in groundwater. NBR gasket is the most effective choice when a gasket material resistant to gasoline is desired. Diffusion cell experiments in combination with numerical simulations can be used in evaluating possible BTEX permeations effectively. Gasket exposure area and its orientation in the socket after pipe joint assembly are likely to affect permeation path and permeated mass of contaminants. Results from this study {{can be used as a}} basis for crisis management for DI pipes exposed to gasoline and for development of a better gasket to improve the reliability of infrastructure of development of water distribution system...|$|R

Programa de Pós-Graduação em OdontologiaO objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar, num modelo de apicificação ex vivo, se a interação do sistema MTA/dentina com PBS {{intracanal}} e se a adição de 10 % de cloreto de cálcio (CaCl 2) ao MTA Branco exercem influência sobre o selamento apical. Sessenta segmentos radiculares (12 mm) foram divididos em 2 grupos (n= 30) de acordo com o cimento empregado na confecção do tampão apical: G 1, MTA Branco e G 2, MTA Branco + 10 % CaCl 2. Em seguida foram inseridos em uma esponja floral umedecida com PBS e subdivididos (n= 15) : nos segmentos dos grupos G 1 A e G 2 A, uma bolinha de algodão umedecida com água destilada foi colocada na região cervical durante 24 h e, depois, substituída por uma seca; nos segmentos dos grupos G 1 B e G 2 B, o espaço do canal foi preenchido com PBS. Todas as cavidades foram seladas e, decorridos 2 meses, foi realizado o teste de infiltração de glicose. Uma pressão de 103 KPa (15 psi) foi gerada, e a solução de glicose forçada no sentido apical durante 60 min. A concentração de glicose (g/L) infiltrada foi quantificada por meio de espectrofotômetro. O conjunto de dados foi tratado estatisticamente pelo teste Kruskal-Wallis e Mann-Whitney a um nível de significância de 5 %. Não foram observadas diferenças significativas entre os resultados dos grupos 1 A e 1 B (p= 0, 258), e 2 A e 2 B (p= 0, 287), no entanto os segmentos radiculares que receberam PBS intracanal apresentaram menor número de amostras com traços da solução e menor valor médio de concentração de glicose. Foram observadas diferenças significativas entre os resultados dos grupos 1 A e 2 A (p= 0, 0037) e 1 B e 2 B (p= 0, 019). Os segmentos radiculares que receberam o tampão com MTA Branco + 10 % CaCl 2 apresentaram maior número de amostras com traços da solução e maior valor médio de concentração de glicose. Foi possível concluir que, embora sem diferença significativa, a interação do sistema MTA/dentina com PBS intracanal influenciou positivamente o selamento apical. A adição de CaCl 2 ao MTA influenciou negativamente o selamento apical. The aim of {{this study}} was to investigate, in an ex vivo apexification model, if the interaction of the MTA-dentin system with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and if the addition of calcium chloride (CaCl 2) 10 % to MTA influence the apical <b>seal.</b> Sixty root <b>segments</b> (12 mm) were divided into two groups (n= 30) according to the cement used to form the apical plug: G 1, MTA and G 2, MTA + 10 % CaCl 2. After that, the root segments were introduced in floral foams moistened with PBS and subdivided (n= 15) : in the segments of the groups G 1 A and G 2 A, a cotton pellet moistened with distilled water was placed in the cervical region for 24 h and, after, replaced by a dry one; in the segments of the groups G 1 B and G 2 B, the remaining canal space was filling with PBS as an intracanal dressing. All access openings were filled and, after 2 months, prepared in a double chamber apparatus to evaluate the glucose leakage, along the apical plugs. A pressure of 103 KPa (15 psi) was created, and the glucose solution was forced apically for 60 min. The amount of glucose leakage was quantified by a spectrophotometer. Data were analyzed by using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney test. Significance was set at á= 5 %. There were no significant differences between the results of the groups 1 A and 1 B (p= 0, 258), and 2 A and 2 B (p= 0, 287). However, the root segments that were filling with PBS as an intracanal dressing had the smaller number of samples with traces of the solution and the lower mean of glucose concentration. Significant differences were observed between the results of the groups 1 A and 2 A (p= 0, 0037) and 1 B and 2 B (p= 0, 019). The root segments that received MTA + 10 % CaCl 2 had a higher number of samples with traces of the solution and the higher mean of glucose concentration. Although no significant difference, the interaction of the MTA-dentin system with PBS positively influenced the apical seal. The addition of CaCl 2 to the MTA negatively influenced the apical seal...|$|R
