40|$|Truck-Shovel {{operations}} in surface mines involve high costs. Fleet management systems {{can provide a}} tool to improve fleet availability, utilisation and productivity, thereby reducing those costs. However, these systems are expensive to install. <b>Stop-Watch</b> <b>time</b> and motion <b>studies</b> provide a cheaper alternative. They can be undertaken on any segment of the haul cycle to provide accurate timing data, as well as observations on operator performance but are very time consuming and do not provide continuous monitoring of a fleet. This paper provides an analysis of an alternative option; using a GPS collision avoidance system for truck-shovel fleet cycle optimisation. A case study was undertaken based on an operating mine in South-east Queensland using a commercially available GPS collision avoidance system. The approach was to use the GPS collision avoidance system to collect the truck positioning, speed, and timing data, which is automatically recorded {{as part of its}} normal function then to apply this information in a conventional <b>time</b> and motion <b>study.</b> This was combined with production loading data to provide some additional performance indicators. The methodology for using in a truck-shovel fleet cycle optimisation is discussed and the results from the case study are presented. Finally, the applicability of this approach is evaluated...|$|R
40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>studies</b> {{have long}} {{been one of the}} only means of obtaining data for use of {{analysing}} a business process. However useful this tool has been in the past, using only <b>time</b> draining, primitive <b>stop-watch</b> based <b>time</b> <b>studies</b> have seemed to run its course and it has surely become necessary to make use of available technology to further analysis of business productivity measures. Image analysis has been used in the past to not only predict weather patterns and position of stars and planets, but also with success in the fields of bio-informatics to analyse genes. If it is possible to analyse small entities like genes, as well as planet bodies millions of kilometres away, why not try and use some of these same techniques in business? This document provides a basic outline of how an image can be described, as well as examples of techniques {{that can be used to}} divert an image to either mathematical or graphical metrics. A basic timeline and project plan will also accompany the document to give the reader a sense of when to expect which deliverables. Accompanying this project plan will be explanations of how image analysis is used in other disciplines. The aim of this project is to see whether it is possible and plausible to measure various productivity levels using image analysis and afterwards using the obtained data as input to successfully calculate performance indicators important in the industry of managing productivity such as throughput and inventory levels. The research into the application of using business process images to determine productivity measures will be proven to have a valid place in the industry as a practical and beneficial methodology, using available technology to improve not only the way that business is done, but allowing for radical change in the small to medium business sector, giving more business owners the advantage of using methods that are not only less tedious, but can be shared with the industry to benefit all. As a whole, this dissertation provides the platform from which not only further research can be done to illustrate the necessity of an alternative technique to determine productivity measures, but gives the reader insight into software that may be applicable in developing the above-mentioned technique of determining productivity measures by using business process images.

40|$|The four square {{step test}} (FSST) is {{commonly}} used to assess dynamic standing balance in elderly adult populations. To date, only the time (recorded by a stop-watch) to complete the test has been used. Other important dynamic balance information such as step velocity and step displacement can be extracted. This study re-examined the validity of recording the FSST <b>time</b> with a <b>stop-watch</b> by comparing it to a "gold standard" method (Vicon) and investigated the relationship between FSST <b>stop-watch</b> <b>time</b> and measures of step velocity, step displacement, and age. After familiarization, fourty-one healthy adults (42 ± 12 yrs.) completed three FSST trials. The FSST time was recorded by a stop-watch and the participants&# 039; foot movements were simultaneously recorded by a Vicon motion system (120 Hz). Measures extracted from the Vicon system were FSST time, step velocity (four directions) and step displacement (four directions). A paired t-test {{was used to compare}} FSST time recorded by each system. Pearson&# 039;s correlation analyses were conducted to identify relationships between measures. No significant difference was found between the FSST time recorded by the methods (mean differ-ence = 0. 02 ± 0. 11 s). Moreover, a strong positive linear rela-tionship (r = 0. 99, p &lt; 0. 0001) was found between the FSST time recorded by the methods. A moderate linear relationship was found between the FSST time (Vicon) and step velocity (r = 0. 67, p &lt; 0. 0001). Poor linear relationships were found be-tween (1) step velocity and step displacement, (2) FSST time (Vicon) and step displacement, (3) FSST time (both methods) and age, (4) age and step velocity, and (5) age and step dis-placement. In conclusion, the FSST stop-watch method is valid. Moreover, it may be used to predict step velocity but not step displacement. No relationship was found between age and the FSST time, step velocity or step displacement...|$|R

The paper significantly highlight problem in computing the OEE which is the inaccuracy of the data used and lack of a medium to evaluate the improvement ideas before it is implemented. MOST is an effective method to evaluate and shows the gain from the improvement ideas proposed without investing in costly implementations. The limitation of this study is mainly concerned with direct stopwatch <b>time</b> <b>study</b> performed during initial stage as it might varies from one person to another.

The <b>time</b> <b>study</b> techniques is applied under certain situation and the stopwatch <b>time</b> <b>study</b> is the best technique for manual production because human performance is not consistent from time to time. The stopwatch <b>time</b> <b>study</b> had been selected for the study because 70 percents of the production in ABC bearings Limited is handled manually by man power. Overall equipment effectiveness is also calculated to measure performance in one shift. The objective is to determine optimal levels of time and defect rate reductions along with the corresponding optimal levels of investments respectively, and the optimal production cycle time for each product...|$|R

50|$|In {{response}} to Taylor’s <b>time</b> <b>studies</b> and {{view of human}} nature, many strong criticisms and reactions were recorded. Unions, for example, regarded <b>time</b> <b>study</b> as a disguised tool of management designed to standardize and intensify the pace of production. Similarly, individuals such as Gilbreth (1909), Cadbury and Marshall heavily criticized Taylor and pervaded his work with subjectivity. For example, Cadbury in reply to Thompson stated that under scientific management employee skills and initiatives are passed from the individual to management, a view reiterated by Nyland. In addition, Taylor’s critics condemned the lack of scientific substance in his <b>time</b> <b>studies,</b> {{in the sense that}} they relied heavily on individual interpretations of what workers actually do. However, the value in rationalizing production is indisputable and supported by academics such as Gantt, Ford and Munsterberg, and Taylor society members Mr C.G. Renold, Mr W.H. Jackson and Mr C.B. Thompson.Proper <b>time</b> <b>studies</b> are based on repeated observation, so that motions performed on the same part differently by one or many workers can be recorded, to determine those values that are truly repetitive and measureable.|$|R
