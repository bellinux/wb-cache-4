50|$|The {{commission}} {{produced a}} report in 1966, proposing that artificial birth control was not intrinsically evil and that Catholic couples {{should be allowed to}} decide for themselves about the methods to be employed. This report was approved by 64 of the 69 members voting. According to this majority report, use of contraceptives should be regarded {{as an extension of the}} already accepted cycle method:The acceptance of a lawful application of the calculated <b>sterile</b> <b>periods</b> of the woman--that the application is legitimate presupposes right motives--makes a separation between the sexual act which is explicitly intended and its reproductive effect which is intentionally excluded. The tradition has always rejected seeking this separation with a contraceptive intention for motives spoiled by egoism and hedonism, and such seeking can never be admitted. The true opposition is not to be sought between some material conformity to the physiological processes of nature and some artificial intervention. For it is natural to man to use his skill in order to put under human control what is given by physical nature. The opposition is really to be sought between one way of acting which is contraceptive and opposed to a prudent and generous fruitfulness, and another way which is, in an ordered relationship to responsible fruitfulness and which has a concern for education and all the essential, human and Christian values.|$|R

40|$|Background: Blood culture {{contamination}} {{leads to}} inappropriate or unnecessary antibiotic use. However, practical guidelines are incon-sistent about the routine use of sterile gloving in {{collection of blood}} for culture. Objective: To determine whether the routine use of sterile gloving before venipuncture reduces blood culture contamination rates. Design: Cluster randomized, assessor-blinded, crossover trial (ClinicalTrials. gov registration number: NCT 00973063). Setting: Single-center trial involving medical wards and the inten-sive care unit. Participants: 64 interns in charge of collection of blood for culture {{were randomly assigned to}} routine-to-optional or optional-to-routine sterile gloving groups for 1854 adult patients who needed blood cultures. Intervention: During routine sterile gloving, the interns wore sterile gloves every time before venipuncture, but during optional sterile gloving, sterile gloves were worn only if needed. Measurements: Isolates from single positive blood cultures were classified as likely contaminant, possible contaminant, or true pathogen. Contamination rates were compared by using general-ized mixed models. Results: A total of 10 520 blood cultures were analyzed: 5265 from the routine <b>sterile</b> gloving <b>period</b> and 5255 from the optional <b>sterile</b> gloving <b>period.</b> When possible contaminants were included, the contamination rate was 0. 6 % in routine sterile gloving and 1. 1 % in optional sterile gloving (adjusted odds ratio, 0. 57 [95 % CI, 0. 37 to 0. 87]; P 0. 009). When only likely contaminants were included, the contamination rate was 0. 5 % in routine sterile gloving and 0. 9 % in optional sterile gloving (adjusted odds ratio, 0. 51 [CI, 0. 31 to 0. 83]; P 0. 007). Limitation: Blood cultures from the emergency department, surgi-cal wards, and pediatric wards were not assessed.

The incidence of male infertility accounted for 5. 0 per cent of all our male out-patients. The peak of the age distribution at the time of first visits was 30 - 34 years of age (average was 31. 4 years old), and patients who had passed three years of a <b>sterile</b> <b>period</b> were the most numerous. No relation was found between male infertility and occupation, but past histories of genital diseases were somewhat related.

40|$|Introduction: Tubal {{flushing}} {{effect is}} a published phenomena of hysterosalpingography in connection with tubal patency test. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the flushing effect of the outpatient method: selective chromopertubation via office hysteroscopy (OHSC-SPT), and compare it to that of HSG. Materials and methods: Sixty infertile patients receiving OHSC-SPT (mean [SD] age: 34. 1 [3. 2] years) and 163 receiving HSG (32. 7 [4. 7] years) took part in the study. As part of the infertility work-up, diagnostic office hysteroscopy was performed to evaluate the uterine cavity. Patients with at least one patent tube had a 12 -month follow-up, during which their obstetrical events, including successful conception of pregnancy after a <b>sterile</b> <b>period,</b> were recorded. The between-groups comparison was quantified by calculating a pregnancy proportion ratio. Results: Out of the 60 OHSC-SPT subjects, both tubes were blocked in 24 cases, and at least one of the tubes was patent in 36 cases. Out of these 36 cases, 7 (19. 4 %) spontaneous pregnancies were conceived; in three (8. 3 %) cases, pregnancy was conceived after intrauterine insemination (IUI) performed on male indication. The number of pregnancies observed in the HSG group (163 examined subjects) was 37 (32 spontaneous, 5 IUI-assisted) out of 153 followed-up subjects (24. 4 %). The pregnancy proportion ratio estimate was 1. 15 (90 % CI: 0. 70 – 1. 90; p =  0. 671).

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1966. Includes bibliographies. viii, 140 l mounted illus., tablesThe {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{analysis}} of the inbreeding effects on a migrant Brazilian population and comparison with other studies. This population (comprising 1068 families with more than 9000 pregnancies) was found to have a good homogeneity between the inbred and control groups with respect to several socio-economic and biological variables. Inbreeding did not have a measurable effect on body weight, height, or hematocrit. These results are compatible with a small dominant component in the inheritance of the traits in question. However, diastolic blood pressure showed a significant increase with inbreeding. Diastolic blood pressure increased by 3. 6 mm Hg per 10 % of inbreeding. Although this association could well be spurious, the need for further investigation clearly emerges, not only in connection with the present results, but also with the results of Nance and collaborators of an apparent association of diastolic blood pressure and the ABO blood group system. Turning to mortality, there was a complete lack of inbreeding response of both stillbirths and postnatal deaths; however, abortions plus miscarriages showed a significant inbreeding effect (of both the mother and fetus). Our interpretation is that two opposing forces are being measured. On one hand recessive lethal genes tend to increase the risk of inbred fetuses {{and on the other hand}} genes involved in incompatibility mechanisms lead to a smaller death risk. This hypothesis is based on the observed interaction effects of inbreeding of the mother and inbreeding of the zygote, with parity. In an attempt to study the inbreeding effect on early and undetected abortions, we used the fraction of the cohabitation time during which the mother was not known to be pregnant or in postpartum infertility as a parameter that would measure a <b>sterile</b> <b>period</b> due to embryonic loss if all the other concomitant variables are randomly distributed with respect to F. "Waiting time" for a mother to become pregnant was distributed independently of F, thus providing no evidence for a large number of lethal equivalents acting at this period of life. The best approach available today to resolve segregation and mutation loads is the use of the double binomial model of segregation analysis. This was applied for the malformation and early fetal death data in the present material and showed that sporadic cases are not associated with inbreeding, which is inconsistent with the "phenodeviant" hypothesis. Also the present data did not show any heterosis in interracial crosses, as claimed by some proponents of phenodeviants. Comparison of estimates from different populations suggests that non-genetic mechanisms are confounded with effects of inbreeding and interracial crosses in some (perhaps many) studies. The B/A ratio of inbreeding effect to panmictic load has little power to isolate the mutational load unless supplemented by both reliability tests and segregation analysis. When the latter method reveals that inbreeding effects are limited to high-risk families, as in our material, this provides strong evidence for a mutational load...|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} paper, based on {{seasonally}} breeding {{model and the}} logistic model, the effect of lethal control and contraception control on rodent population dynamics is investigated. In the seasonally breeding model, one year is divided into breeding season and non-breeding season and we describe the rodent population dynamics in these two time periods with different continuous mathematical models. When the long-term dynamics of the rodent population is concerned, one year is only a time point, the seasonality of breeding is erased, and the population dynamics is described with the logistic model. Generically, lethal control is actualized through rodenticide and contraception control is actualized through sterilant. After ingesting bait that includes rodenticide or sterilant, the rodent would die or be <b>sterile</b> during a <b>period</b> not longer than several days. This period is very short compared to the whole lifetime of rodent, so we suppose that the control is accomplished at a time point instantaneously. Usually, {{there is a long}} time interval between two control practices, so we assume that the controls are implemented at discrete times with equal intervals.|$|R
40|$|An {{organism}} of the Pasteurella group (Pasteurella avicida) {{has been}} shown to possess considerable pathogenicity for rabbits when injected into the trachea. 1 cc. of bouillon containing 1 / 100 cc. of a 24 hour bouillon culture introduced by means of a curved metal tube passed through the larynx gives rise to a rapidly fatal septicemia in which the lungs are not particularly involved. Rabbits may be made completely resistant to this intratracheal infection by means of intratracheal, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous injections of killed cultures. Vaccination and subsequent injection of living culture beneath the skin resulted in extensive abscess formation about the site of inoculation. Vaccines sprayed on the mucous membranes of the nose and throat failed to raise appreciably the resistance against subsequent intratracheal injection. Rabbits whose resistance has been stimulated within narrow limits by a small dose of vaccine beneath the skin become more resistant to the experimental respiratory infection.

The {{present study was}} undertaken to develop a diffusion chamber model system in mice in order to study the in vivo effects of prolonged fluconazole treatment on Candida albicans. Chambers containing 100 C. albicans yeast cells were implanted subcutaneously on the flanks of C 57 BL/ 6 mice and were then retrieved 6 or 14 weeks later (after fluconazole treatment for 4 or 12 weeks, respectively). Leukocyte counts demonstrated that implantation of the chambers did elicit an inflammatory response but that only small numbers of inflammatory cells were able to enter the chamber interior. Treatment with fluconazole at 10 mg/kg of body weight/day for 12 weeks not only reduced the numbers of viable organisms within the chambers compared to those in untreated mice (mean ± standard deviation of log 10 CFU of 0. 7 ± 1. 2 versus 2. 3 ± 2. 0; P < 0. 001 by the Bonferroni test) but also increased the numbers of chambers that became sterile over the treatment period (14 of 16 versus 6 of 19; P = 0. 0009 by the chi-square test).

Using field cage tests that provide a better approximation of nature, we here investigated whether access to yeast hydrolysate for 48 h after adult emergence improves the ability {{of male and female}} mass-reared, sterile Q-flies to compete sexually with wild-type flies that had been provided continuous access to yeast hydrolysate. Mating probability of sterile males was significantly increased by 48 -h access to yeast hydrolysate; sterile males provided 48 -h access to yeast hydrolysate had mating probability similar to that of wild males provided continuous access to yeast hydrolysate, whereas sterile males deprived of access to yeast hydrolysate had much lower mating probability. Unlike males, access to yeast hydrolysate for 48 h did not increase mating probability of sterile female Q-flies. We instead found that wild females provided continuous access to yeast hydrolysate had higher mating probability than sterile females that did or did not have 48 -h access to yeast hydrolysate. This result raises the possibility that a bisexual Q-fly strain might operate essentially as a male-only release when the flies are given access to yeast hydrolysate during a 48 -h pre-release holding <b>period.</b> <b>Sterile</b> males given access to yeast hydrolysate for 48 h mated significantly earlier in the evening than wild males and, as in other recent studies, this tendency was associated with an increased tendency to mate on the trees rather than the cage walls.

40|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} whereby animals can be totally, partially, and intermittently deprived of their bile, without infection of this secretion or of the duct system. In all the instances considered the bile remained <b>sterile</b> throughout the <b>period</b> of the experiment. With this aid we have studied urobilin physiology. We {{have been able to}} show that the normal presence of urobilin in the bile and feces of dogs depends on the passage of bile pigment to the intestine, either through the normal channels, or by abnormal ones, as when it is fed by mouth. Complete loss of the bile from the body resulted in the total disappearance of urobilin and urobilinogen from the bile, feces, and urine. Rarely very faint traces remained in the feces, the origin of which has been discussed. Partial loss of the bile resulted in a corresponding reduction in the urobilin of the dejecta. Feedings of sterile urobilin-free dog bile to intubated dogs losing all of their bile and having no urobilin in it, or in feces or urine, were followed by the appearance of the pigment in the hepatic bile secreted shortly thereafter. When the feedings were stopped the urobilin soon disappeared. Total obstruction of the bile flow caused disappearance of the urobilin of the bile and stool. Later as the animals became heavily jaundiced the pigment appeared again in very small quantity in the feces. Autopsy at this time showed that the intestinal mucosa was deeply tinted with bilirubin some of which undoubtedly had passed into the lumen of the bowel and had there been changed to urobilin. Employment of the "altercursive intubation," by which an intermittent diversion of the bile stream of animals from the intestine to a collecting apparatus could be effected, showed that while bile pigment still reached the intestine urobilin was present in the bile secreted by the liver but that almost at once after the bile had been diverted from the gut urobilin disappeared from it. In relation to this finding it was noticed that in animals from which merely {{a small fraction of the}} bile was collected, that from a single liver lobe, while the greater portion reached the intestine there was most urobilin in the bile at times when most bilirubin was entering the intestine...|$|R
