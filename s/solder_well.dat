[...] So, to confound this hated coin, All parties and religions join; Whigs, Tories, Trimmers, Hanoverians, Quakers, Conformists, Presbyterians, Scotch, Irish, English, French, unite, With equal interest, equal spite Together mingled in a lump, Do all in one opinion jump; And ev'ry one begins to find The same impression on his mind.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} of solder plays a {{key role}} in the reliability of electronic packages. In this study, the cyclic shear deformation experienced by Sn- 37 Pb solder joints was simulated by thermomechanically cycling model joints between 30 °C and 125 °C, and the nature of the damage investigated. Most of the developed shear strain was accommodated by the solder adjacent to the interface with the intermetallic layer, and its severity diminished exponentially with distance from the interface. Shear bands formed at this location and within the shear bands, significant microstructural coarsening occurred together with crack initiation on the outer free surface of the solder. Subsequent cycling produced multiple cracking, fragmentation, and macroscopic decohesion, progressing toward the interior of the solder. Secondary cracks initiated from the primary cracks and propagated along colony boundaries in the surface layers of the solder perpendicular to the shear direction. In the interior of the <b>solder,</b> <b>well</b> away from the interface with the intermetallic layer, a limited amount of coarsening occurred. Apart from smoothing of undulations, the intermetallic layer was unaffected...|$|E

40|$|To allow {{realistic}} stress {{assessments of}} BGA modules during drop and shock events, the dynamic mechanical behavior of SAC BGA solder joints {{was determined by}} a combination of fast shear tests and FEM simulations. The goal has been the development of a validated material model for SnAg 1. 0 Cu 0. 5 BGA solder joints that accounts for dynamic material hardening and the dependency of the fracture mode on the shear speed. Therefore, fast shear experiments of single joints have been performed applying a DAGE® tester to BGA solder balls being attached to Cu+Ni/Au pads with recording the peak shear forces and fracture surface plots.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the end point of the plasma cleaning process, in order to save valuable production time and also to prevent the destruction of expensive devices through overheating. Design/methodology/approach – Post plasma cleaning analysis using dynamic contact angle (DCA) analysis and video microscope observations have been conducted on plasma treated Entec coated copper, hot air solder levelled (HASL) and electroless nickel immersion gold (ENIG) surfaces in order to determine the effect of surface finish on plasma process times. Post plasma cleaning and lead-free wave soldering analysis of the three surface finishes have been evaluated. Findings – The DCA results indicate that the end point for plasma cleaning of Entec coated copper is achieved within one to three minutes (indicated by a low contact angle hysteresis). Further cleaning after three minutes may lead to surface degradation and poor solder wettability. This is consistent with the results of the video microscope observations which show <b>well</b> <b>soldered</b> component leads and pads with good solder coverage for copper surface finish treated at a short plasma process time (one minute) and poorly soldered component leads and pads for a surface treated at a long process time (ten minutes).

Originality/value – This paper indicates that plasma process time determines the wettability and solderability of the treated samples.
