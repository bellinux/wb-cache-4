Apple only agreed to cross-license some patents to Nokia.

These components are complex since they deal with low-level hardware features, especially at early stages of initialization. The complexity increases considerably with extensions required to enable additional platform functionality. For example, BIOS extensions such as op-tion ROMs allow device-specific initialization, and EFI BIOS extensions enable filesystem and network access.
