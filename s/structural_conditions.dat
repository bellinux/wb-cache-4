Sound change can consist of {{the replacement of}} one speech sound or phonetic feature by another, {{the complete loss of}} the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its <b>structural</b> <b>conditions</b> are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a chain shift in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic languages when the sound change known as Grimm's law affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant * became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous * in turn became /p/, and the previous * became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have p in words like pater and pisces, whereas Germanic languages, like English, have father and fish.|$|E

25|$|Other {{authors have}} focused on the <b>structural</b> <b>conditions</b> leading up to {{genocide}} and the psychological and social processes that create an evolution toward genocide. Ervin Staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing. They lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy. A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim, past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds, authoritarian cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and external witnesses (bystanders) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide. Intense conflict between groups that is unresolved, becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide. The conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention, such as humanizing a devalued group, creating ideologies that embrace all groups, and activating bystander responses. There is substantial research to indicate how this can be done, but information is only slowly transformed into action.|$|E

Their structural deterioration is progressive with aging and will eventually cause pipe collapse with consequences of service interruption. Predicting <b>structural</b> <b>condition</b> of pipes provides vital information for asset management to prevent unexpected failures and to extend service life. This study focused on predicting the <b>structural</b> <b>condition</b> of storm-water pipes with two objectives. The first objective is the prediction of <b>structural</b> <b>condition</b> changes of the whole network of storm-water pipes by a Markov model at different times during their service life. This information {{can be used for}} planning annual budget and estimating the useful life of pipe assets. The second objective is the prediction of <b>structural</b> <b>condition</b> of any particular pipe by a neural network model. This knowledge is valuable in identifying pipes that are in poor condition for repair actions. A case study with closed circuit television inspection snapshot data was used to demonstrate the applicability of these two models. ...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the <b>structural</b> <b>condition</b> of {{a highway}} {{pavement}} {{is important for}} pavement management at both the network level and the project level, particularly when the system monitoring, evaluation, and decision-making are {{to be made in}} a context of multiple criteria that include <b>structural</b> <b>condition.</b> A key aspect of the performance criteria for multiple criteria decision making is that the criteria must be amenable to scaling {{so that it can be}} duly incorporated in the overall utility function. The unbounded nature of existing structural performance indicators inhibits their use in such decision making contexts. Also, most of the existing indicators are cumbersome and/or too costly to measure as they require extensive coring, ground penetrating radar, or deployment of other expensive equipment to obtain the needed parameters for their computation. To address this gap in the literature, the present thesis developed an index to assess the <b>structural</b> <b>condition</b> of a pavement using deflection data from Falling Weight Deflectometer measurements. The newly developed index is termed “structural strength index” (SSI). The scale selected was a logistic scale that was developed on the basis of cumulative distribution of deflection numbers on the Indiana state highway network. Using this scaling formula, the value of <b>structural</b> <b>condition</b> for a given pavement section can be established given the deflection in mils. Furthermore, taking cognizance of the fact that deflection data (and thus SSIs) are not available at all pavement sections, the thesis developed statistical regression models by which the <b>structural</b> <b>condition</b> of a pavement could be estimated given its basic characteristics such as functional class, age, and drainage condition. The developed index can be used as one of the performance measures for evaluating alternative investments that seek to enhance pavement <b>structural</b> <b>condition,</b> at both the project level and the network level. ...|$|R

500|$|After the {{turbulent}} 1800 papal conclave, Pope Pius VII (1800–1823) shunned {{the institution of}} the cardinal-nephew and instead relied on his Cardinal Secretary of State, Ercole Consalvi. During the 19th century, the only nephew of a Pope created cardinal was Gabriele della Genga Sermattei, nephew of Pope Leo XII, created cardinal by Pope Gregory XVI on February 1, 1836. Although the institutionalization of nepotism disappeared in the 18th century, [...] "pietas" [...] (duty to family) remained a theme of papal administration into the 20th century, although rarely with the overt intervention of a papal uncle. Following the example of Pius VI, Popes Leo XIII (who elevated his brother, Giuseppe Pecci, cardinal on May 12, 1879) and Pius XII (1939–1958) weakened the formal curial bureaucracy in favor of a parallel government, in which family members often figured prominently. The loss of temporal power over the Papal States (de facto in 1870 with the [...] "Roman Question" [...] and de jure in 1929 with the Lateran Treaty) also eliminated the <b>structural</b> <b>conditions</b> which had figured prominently in the family politics of earlier Popes.|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} for highway agencies to apply seal coats, thin overlays, {{and other types}} of surface treatments to preserve the highway network by improving the pavement surface condition. These maintenance treatments serve as a temporary improvement of the surface condition; however, they do not remedy any structural deficiency associated with the pavements. In order for such preventive maintenance treatments to be cost-effective, pavements receiving these treatments should have adequate structural capacity; otherwise, the preventive treatments will fail before they reach the normally expected service life, resulting in an ineffective use of maintenance resources. Although pavement condition data, such as visual distress and ride quality, provides a good indication of the overall network-level pavement condition, it does not give a direct measure of the structural adequacy of a pavement. To address this issue, it is proposed to implement a network-level <b>Structural</b> <b>Condition</b> Index based on the Falling Weight Deflectometer deflection data. This implementation study focuses on the validation of a <b>Structural</b> <b>Condition</b> Index developed under a previous study and the development of various criteria essential for the implementation of the <b>Structural</b> <b>Condition</b> Index at the network level, including the minimum sample size for collecting the Falling Weight Deflectometer deflection data.

2500|$|Rather he {{uses the}} logic of {{hermeneutic}} tradition (from interpretative sociology) to argue {{for the importance of}} agency in sociological theory, claiming that human social actors are always to some degree knowledgeable about what they are doing. Social order is therefore a result of some pre-planned social actions, not automatic evolutionary response. Sociologists, unlike natural scientists, have to interpret a social world which is already interpreted by the actors that inhabit it. According to Giddens there is a [...] "Duality of structure" [...] by which social practice, which is the principal unit of investigation, has both a structural and an agency-component. [...] The structural environment constrains individual behaviour, but also makes it possible. He also noted the existence of a specific form of a social cycle: once sociological concepts are formed, they filter back into everyday world and change the way people think. Because social actors are reflexive and monitor the ongoing flow of activities and <b>structural</b> <b>conditions,</b> they adapt their actions to their evolving understandings. As a result, social scientific knowledge of society will actually change human activities. Giddens calls this two-tiered, interpretive and dialectical relationship between social scientific knowledge and human practices the [...] "double hermeneutic".|$|E
