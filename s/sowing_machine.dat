To evaluate the emission characteristics of <b>sowing</b> <b>machines</b> during <b>sowing</b> based on secure data, the technical basis for a test method for measuring the drift of abraded seed-dust in <b>sowing</b> <b>machines</b> were developed at the Centre for Agricultural Technology Augustenberg. An indoor test bench was created and a standardized test method by which it is possible to evaluate the drift behavior of <b>sowing</b> <b>machines</b> in comparison was developed. A granulate which is stained with a fluorescent Tracer is used as test seed. The „tracer technique“ allows a reproducible, rapid and inexpensive assessment of the drift behavior of the sowing technology, which is commonly used. To classify the obtained drift values in the test bench, measurements in the field were carried out for comparison. The determined drift volumes of those measurements were at a similar level as the measured values in the test stand. Therefore the standardized measurement of drift in the test stand is suitable for the calculation of exposure scenarios for the sowing of treated seeds...|$|R

Findings: The parameters such as working efficiency, depth of sowing, inter - row distance and distance between seeds in the sowing row were measured and calculated. Research limitations/implications: Cultivation of sugar beet depends primarily on expert and technically correct sowing. Distance between seeds in the sowing row must enable the plants to have optimum conditions for their growth and development. For successful sowing it is necessary to know adequacy of the soil for sowing, technical properties of the <b>sowing</b> <b>machine</b> and biotechnical characteristics of the seed.

In Europe proso millet is sowed between mid-April {{and the end}} of May. 500g/are of seeds are {{required}} which comes up to 500 grains/m2. In organic farming this amount should be increased if a harrow weeder is used. For sowing, the usual <b>sowing</b> <b>machines</b> can be used similarly to how they are used for other crops like wheat. A distance between the rows of from 16 to 25 centimeters is recommended if the farmer uses an interrow cultivator. The sowing depth should be 1.5 up to 2 cm in optimal soil or 3 to 4 cm in dry soil. Rolling of the ground after sowing is helpful for further cultivation. Cultivation in no-till farming systems is also possible and often practiced in the United States. Sowing then can be done two weeks later.|$|R

A distribuição das pressões (kPa) no solo foi detectada por sensores localizados em diferentes camadas no solo. As propriedades físicas avaliadas foram a densidade do solo (Ds) e a resistência à penetração (RP) na linha e na entrelinha da cultura da beterraba-açucareira (Beta vulgaris L.), até a profundidade de 0, 30 m. Os tratamentos foram: sem pressão extra exercida pela semeadora, denominado sem compactação (SC); pressão exercida pela semeadora considerada de baixa carga (BC); pressão exercida pela semeadora considerada de alta carga (AC); e pressão exercida pelas rodas do trator usado no preparo do solo ou carga do trator (CT). Em relação à distribuição das cargas no solo, na camada de 0 - 0, 10 m foram detectados valores de pressão no solo acima de 120 kPa, considerados muito altos. O incremento de pressão do tratamento SC para AC resultou em maiores pressões na camada de 0 - 0, 10 m comparada à de 0, 10 - 0, 20 m, enquanto o tratamento CT resultou em maiores pressões no solo na camada de 0, 10 - 0, 20 m, em relação aos outros tratamentos. Em decorrência das cargas mecânicas aplicadas, verificou-se aumento da Ds em superfície, na sequência SC The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of different mechanical loads on soil physical properties of a Eutric Cambisol with loam sandy texture. The soil load distribution (kPa) was measured in situ by sensors placed in different soil layers. The soil physical properties evaluated were the bulk density (Ds) and the soil penetration resistance (RP) on sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) row and interrow down to 0. 30 m depth. The treatments were: without extra pressure exerted by the <b>sowing</b> <b>machine,</b> or no-compaction (SC); low pressure exerted by the <b>sowing</b> <b>machine,</b> named low load (BC); high pressure exerted the <b>sowing</b> <b>machine,</b> named high load (AC) and load pressure exerted by the tractor wheels used in the seedbed preparation, or tractor load (CT). The soil load distribution data indicated that the 0 - 0. 10 m layer had soil stresses values higher than 120 kPa, which are considered very high. The increase on soil stresses from treatments SC to AC caused higher stress on topsoil than in the 0. 10 - 0. 20 m depth, while that under CT treatment showed higher stress at the 0. 10 - 0. 20 m layer. As a consequence of the soil stress load it was verified an increase on Ds in the more superficial soil layer (0 - 10 cm), and it followed the sequence: SC<BC<AC<CT. The RP was higher than 2. 0 MPa at the 0. 10 - 0. 15 m layer under conventional tillage for the CT treatment. Under minimum tillage the RP reached values above of 1. 5 MPa in all treatments, and values higher than 2. 5 MPa were observed below the 0. 25 m soil layer. The soil under treatments SC, BC and AC presented significant differences in RP between row and interrow positions at the 0. 10 - 0. 15 m layer; higher RP values were found for the row position. In general, the CT treatment showed higher Ds and RP values due to the greater stress applied on the soil...|$|E
40|$|A {{lot of work}} in the {{agriculture}} world consists of guiding a vehicle on a field. The goal is to cover the entire field with e. g. a plow or a <b>sowing</b> <b>machine.</b> Today there are several systems available which assist the driver. However, no system is able to completely automate the tasks. This thesis investigates GPs potential for automating these tasks in a simulated environment. The investigation was performed by extending the well known Lawnmower problem, proposed by Koza, into a little more realistic version. A simulator was implemented and a set of tests conducted with two different types of controllers. Some of tests showed promise, but in most cases much of the area was left uncovered. The overall strategy used by the controllers seemed too simplistic for general use. Even though some of the results were promising, it is difficult to generalize and say something about its real world usefulness. A more in-depth investigation is needed before any definite conclusion can be made. One thing is certain, efficient and accurate automatic controllers will be greatly appreciated by a farmer. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWinter wheat is {{one kind}} of {{important}} crop in China. It’s planting area is one key element to explain yield change. To obtain winter wheat planting area {{as soon as possible}} can provide scientific reference for our country’s making related policy. Basing on the cropping system in Shandong province, winter wheat is divided into two kinds “winter wheat sowed by machine-maize” and “people broadcast winter wheat-rice”. Using MODIS data, NDVI characters of winter wheat, garlic, greenhouse vegetable, from sowing till overwintering stage were analyzed. Together with NDVI characters of former stubble crops in middle September, extracting requirements were set up for winter wheat planting area which was <b>sowed</b> by <b>machine</b> this year. In view of the spectrum similarity between rice wheat and greenhouse vegetable from sowing stage till overwintering stage, rice wheat planting area of former year was extracted relying on the character of biomass rapid growth at jointing stage. Because of the “people broadcast winter wheat-rice” cropping system is very fixed in Shandong province, then the rice wheat planting area of former year can take the place of the rice wheat planting area this year. Two kinds of winter wheat area were merged, and tested by 284 groups of located spots data, the accuracy reached 94. 01 %. The result showed that it is feasible to extract winter wheat area before overwintering stage, and the time is 4 months earlier than using jointing stage NDVI...|$|R
40|$|Contribution of {{mechanical}} inputs in farming is considered {{in terms of}} farm mechanization. Farm mechanization has helped in increasing the cultivated area and yield of major crops like wheat, rice and maize to 0. 4 %, 10. 4 % and 27. 3 %, respectively, by bringing barren land under cultivation. To study the present status of farm mechanization in all the districts of Punjab using GIS, data of farm <b>machines,</b> <b>sowing</b> area and wheat crop production was collected from Census Organizations for 1994 - 95 to 2004 - 05. Graduated color maps and multivariate maps were {{used to analyze the}} spatial variation in farm mechanization in thirty four districts of Punjab upto year 2004. To analyze the combined effect of most common farm machines (tractors, disc plows, cultivators, tubewells and threshers) on cultivated area of wheat and its production, multivariate maps help by considering the sum attribute of these farm machines. According to maps generated; Central, Southern and Eastern Punjab have greater area under cultivation as compared to Northern Punjab except Attock and Mianwali and there is a great need of recommended farm machines which may help to increase the wheat production for the same area under cultivation...|$|R
40|$|Two field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} at Kafr El-Hamam Research Station, Zagazig district, Sharkia Governorate, Agricultural Research Center, Egypt, during 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010 seasons to study the effect of sowing methods (manual and mechanical), weed control treatments (one hoeing, Goltix 70 WG (metamitron), Goltix+one hoeing and two hoeing) and nitrogen fertilizer levels (60, 80 and 100 kg N/fed) on yield, its components and quality of sugar beet cv. Hanrike. The obtained results could be summarized as follows; Mechanical sowing method of sugar beet significantly surpassed the traditional sowing method in root and foliage fresh weights/plant, root/top ratio, root length and diameter, root, top and sugar yields/fed in both seasons. Sowing methods showed significant effect on TSS, sucrose and purity percentages in both seasons, except purity% in the second season. Controlling weeds by two hand hoeings significantly recorded the highest values of root, top and sugar yields/fed and its components and purity percentage in both seasons. However, the highest percentages of TSS and sucrose were achieved from controlling weed by one hand hoeing in both seasons. Fertilizing sugar beet plants with 100 kg N/fed significantly increased yields and its components and markedly recorded the highest values in both seasons. From the obtained, {{it can be concluded}} that sowing sugar beet using mechanical <b>sowing</b> method (planter <b>machine),</b> controlling weeds by hand hoeing and mineral fertilizing with 100 kg N/fed could be recommended in order to maximize its productivity and quality under the environmental conditions of Sharkia Governorate, Egypt...|$|R
