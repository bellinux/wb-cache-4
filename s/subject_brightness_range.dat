40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{statistics of}} the line-doubling phenomenon {{in a sample}} of 81 long-period variable (LPV) stars of various periods, spectral types and <b>brightness</b> <b>ranges.</b> When correlated with a mask mimicking a K 0 III spectrum, 54 % of the sample stars clearly showed a double-peaked cross-correlation profile around maximum light, reflecting double absorption lines. Several pieces of evidence are presented that point towards the double absorption lines as being caused by the propagation of a shock wave through the photosphere. The observation of the Balmer lines appearing in emission around maximum light in these stars corroborates the presence of a shock wave. The observed velocity discontinuities, ranging between 10 and 25 km/s, are not correlated with the <b>brightness</b> <b>ranges.</b> A comparison with the center-of-mass (COM) velocity obtained from submm CO lines originating in the circumstellar envelope reveals that the median velocity between the red and blue peaks is blueshifted with respect to the COM velocity, as expected if the shock moves upwards.

50|$|It {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with dynamic range, the range of light intensities a medium can capture simultaneously. A recording medium with greater dynamic range will be able to record more details in the dark and light areas of a picture. Latitude depends on dynamic range. If the same scene can be recorded using less than the full <b>brightness</b> <b>range</b> available to the medium, the exposure can be shifted along the range without losing information in the shadows or highlights. Greater exposure latitude allows one to compensate for errors in exposure while retaining quality.|$|R

Each 4×2 region also has a 3-bit <b>brightness</b> <b>range</b> selection.
