5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of February 19, 1845, a large {{earthquake}} resulted in a substantial mudflow. This mudflow flowed down {{the valley of the}} Lagunillas River for approximately , <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> of the river channel and killing much of the local population. After reaching an alluvial fan, the mudflow split into two branches. The larger portion of it joined the Lagunillas River and flowed into the nearby Magdalena River, while the smaller portion was diverted by hills in front of Lagunillas Canyon, turned 90degrees to the north until it reached the Sabandija River, and then flowed east with the Sabandija River, until it rejoined the other branch of the mudflow at the junction of the Sabandija and the Magdalena. It is estimated that 1000people were killed in the mudflows.|$|E

25|$|Early corsets of the 16th century {{consisted}} of paste-stiffened linen and a primitive busk {{at the front}} but later included iron supports at the side and back. The emphasis now was on form, with compression of the breasts forcing them upwards {{to the point of}} almost <b>spilling</b> <b>out,</b> so a considerable part of the breast was exposed. The ideal form was a flat torso, which inevitably pushed the breasts upwards and out. The labouring class by contrast wore a simple front-lacing cotte.|$|E
25|$|Venom is {{the defense}} of choice for many ants (family Formicidae). It is {{injected}} from an ovipositor that has been evolutionarily modified into a stinging apparatus. These ants release a complex venom mixture that can include histamine. Within the Formicinae subfamily, the stinger has been lost and instead the poison gland forcibly ejects the fluid of choice, formic acid. Some carpenter ants (genus Camponotus) also have mandibular glands that extend throughout their bodies. When these are mechanically irritated, the ant commits suicide by exploding, <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> a sticky, entangling substance.|$|E
25|$|Another venerable Corfu {{tradition}} {{is known as}} the Carnival or Ta Karnavalia. Venetian in origin, festivities include a parade featuring the main attraction of Karnavalos, a rather grotesque figure with a large head and smiling face, leading a diverse procession of colourful floats. Corfiots, young and old, dress up in colourful costumes and follow the parade, <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> into the area's narrow streets (kantounia) and spreading the festivities across the city, dancing and socialising. At night, in the island's more sophisticated social circles, dance and costume parties are traditional.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the latter}} 19th century, Santiago Creek {{and its tributaries}} were free flowing {{perennial}} streams <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> of Santa Ana Mountains canyons onto the broad, alluvial floodplain. The creek wound on the plain {{for the rest of}} its course to its confluence with the Santa Ana River. coast live oaks (Quercus agrifolia), California sycamores (Platanus racemosa), white alders (Alnus rhombifolia), native willows (Salix species), and other riparian habitat vegetation lined the route of the creek and its primary tributaries. The creek and adjacent habitats supported a wide variety of birds, amphibians, fish, insects, and mammals.|$|E

Wednesday's use of the Key was limited keeping her from becoming any bigger than the massive 126 mile long Leviathanesque whale she has become after her failed attempt to fulfill the Will and the subsequent betrayal by the Morrow Days (with the exception of Monday, who was incapacitated by his sloth). It was used by the Will to control the borders of the Border Sea that were <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> into the Secondary (mortal) Realms and in battle to remove the inherent water from others' bodies. It gives dominion over the Border Sea and Wednesday.|$|E
25|$|The {{match between}} Liverpool and Nottingham Forest began as {{scheduled}} at 3:00pm. Fans were still streaming into pens 3 and 4 {{from the rear}} entrance tunnel as the match began. For some time, problems {{at the front of}} the Liverpool central goal pens went largely unnoticed except by those inside it, and by a few police at that end of the pitch. Liverpool's goalkeeper, Bruce Grobbelaar, reported fans from behind him pleading to him for help as the situation worsened. The police at first attempted to stop fans from <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> of the pens, some believing this to be a pitch invasion. At approximately 3:05pm in match action, Peter Beardsley kicked a shot which struck Nottingham Forest's goal bar. Possibly connected to the excitement, a surge in pen 3 caused one of its metal crush barriers to give way, thrusting people forward on top of one another, and into the pen's front fences.|$|E

25|$|The {{flanks of}} Olympus Mons {{are made up}} of innumerable lava flows and lava channels. Many of the flows have levees along their margins (pictured). Levees are {{parallel}} ridges formed at the edges of lava flows. The cooler, outer margins of the flow solidify, leaving a central trough of molten, flowing lava. Partially collapsed lava tubes are visible as chains of pit craters, and broad lava fans formed by lava emerging from intact, subsurface tubes are also common. In places along the volcano's base, lava flows can be seen <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> into the surrounding plains, forming broad aprons, and burying the basal escarpment. (Note: Lava flows refer to both actively flowing lava and the solidified landforms they produce. The meaning here is the latter, since Mars has no active lava flows at the present time.) Crater counts from high-resolution images taken by the Mars Express orbiter in 2004 indicate that lava flows on the northwestern flank of Olympus Mons range in age from 115 million years old (Mya) to only 2 Mya. These ages are very recent in geological terms, suggesting that the mountain may still be volcanically active, though in a very quiescent and episodic fashion.|$|E

Desson Howe, writing for The Washington Posts Weekend section, said that [...] "the Klingons' spilled blood floats {{in the air in}} eerily beautiful purplish globules; it's space-age Sam Peckinpah."

500|$|In 1919, {{still under}} King's leadership, West Ham gained {{entrance}} to the Football League Second Division, their first game being a 1–1 draw with Lincoln City, and were promoted to Division One in 1923, also {{making it to the}} first ever FA Cup Final to be held at the old Wembley stadium. Their opponents were Bolton Wanderers. This was also known as the White Horse Final, so named because an estimated 200,000 people came to see the match; <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> on to the pitch, which had to be cleared prior to kick-off, by [...] "Billie," [...] a giant white horse (actually grey) being ridden by PC George Scorey. The Cup Final match itself ended 2–0 to Bolton. The team enjoyed mixed success in Division 1 but retained their status for ten years and reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1933.|$|E

500|$|The Marie Antoinette Suite is {{accessed}} {{from the}} main restaurant. According to Marcus Binney [...] "the gilded detail of the room has the lustre and crispness of gilt bronze, even the egg-and-dart in the boldly modelled cornice". Floral motifs are a common feature of the room, given the namesake, Marie Antoinette, and represents the flowers at one of her feasts. Over the overmantel is a basket of flowers, with [...] "flowers <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> over the frames of the oval lunettes". [...] In the small entrance lobby of the suite are two terracotta statues of Spring and Summer, with [...] "drum-shaped pedestals ornamented with gilt-bronze flowers and ribbons". The ventilation grilles, of considerable size, are decorated in bronzed lattice. On the walls are a series lamp holders held by miniature Apollo lyres, with each bulb holder containing around 25 leaves opened out. The lights, according to Binney, are hung on [...] "cords from ribbons tied in bows, entwined at intervals with flowers, descending to a cluster of tassels". [...] The panels of the walls are treated like picture frames, with inner and outer mouldings, {{in contrast to the}} window frames and the wall mirrors which are surrounded by [...] "clusters of reeds, with an inset behind which a curtain could hang without obscuring the moulding", according to Binney.|$|E
