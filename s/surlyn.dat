Balatá-covered balls have a high spin rate, but do not travel as far as most balls with a <b>Surlyn</b> cover. Due to the nondurable nature of the material the golf club strikes, balatá-covered balls do not last long before needing to be replaced. While once favored by professional and low-handicap players, they are now obsolete, replaced by newer <b>Surlyn</b> and urethane technology.|$|E

The engine design was borrowed from Harley's Evolution Sportster engine with the rear cylinder eliminated.

5000|$|The minimum allowed {{diameter}} {{of a golf}} ball is 42.67 mm and its mass may not exceed 45.93 g. Modern golf balls have a two-, three-, or four-layer design constructed from various synthetic materials. The surface usually has a pattern of 300-450 dimples designed to improve the ball's aerodynamics by reducing the ball's drag-inducing wake and allowing spin on the ball to create lift. The method of construction and materials used greatly affect the ball's playing characteristics such as distance, trajectory, spin and feel. Harder materials, such as <b>Surlyn,</b> usually result in the ball's traveling longer distances, while softer covers, such as Urethane, tend to generate higher spin, more [...] "feel" [...] and greater stopping potential. Golf balls are separated into three groups depending on their construction: two-, three-, or four-piece covers. Generally four-piece golf balls {{tend to be the}} most expensive, though price is no assurance of quality.|$|E
50|$|The {{bodyboard}} {{differs from}} a surfboard {{in the fact}} that it is much shorter (typically 38 to 43 in in length) and made out of different types of foam. The modern board consists of a foam 'core' encapsulated by a plastic bottom, a softer foam top known as the deck, softer foam sides known as the rails. The core is made of dow/polyethylene, arcel, or Polypro/polypropylene. The bottom is made of <b>Surlyn</b> or Bixby. The deck is made of 8LB or CrossLink. Each type of foam core, deck, or bottom material gives a bodyboard a different amount of flex and control. Speed from the bottom turn is increased when a bodyboarder bottom turns and the board flexes and recoils, releasing energy. If the board flexes too little or too easily, speed is lost. Dow (polyethylene) cores are best suited to cooler waters as they can be too flexible in warm water. Arcel and Polypro (polypropylene) cores are best suited for warmer waters due to their increased overall stiffness.|$|E
40|$|The ionomer {{known by}} its {{trademark}} name as <b>Surlyn</b> has recently become an area of interest as it reportedly {{has the ability to}} self-heal.

The addition of ionomer markedly enlarged interlayer spacing of the platelets and led to an improved degree of exfoliation. More-over, clay silicates were found to selectively disperse either inside the ionomer phase or at the phase boundary. Com-pared to the binary immiscible blends, an improved interfacial adhesion was achieved for PP/Surlyn/OMMT hybrids. Unlike PP/Surlyn binary blends, the viscoelastic properties of the hybrids significantly increased with increasing <b>Surlyn</b> concentration, which {{could be attributed to}} the improved clay dispersion and the contribution of silicate layers at the interface between PP and <b>Surlyn.</b> A synergistic role between <b>Surlyn</b> and clay was also found to suppress the crystalliza-tion of PP matrix.

Recent results have demonstrated healing in polymeric materials via a chemical reaction using a healing agent or response to thermal treatment. The goal {{of this research is}} to develop a new composite material, for application in wire insulation, that can detect damage and heal itself using resistance heating. The composite material is composed of a conductive network embedded in a polymer matrix. The conductive network is used for damage detection and resistive heating. A matrix material is used that melts when heated and flows to fill damage. External electronic circuitry is used to implement a damage detection algorithm and apply current for resistive heating. <b>Surlyn</b> 8940 is chosen as the polymer matrix and carbon fibers are selected for the resistive heating elements. Methods for melt processing <b>Surlyn</b> are developed and used to produce <b>Surlyn</b> films and composite samples where carbon fiber is embedded in a <b>Surlyn</b> matrix. A finite element model of the resistive heating process is developed to predict the temperature distribution. Thermal imaging is used to characterize resistive heating while optical microscopy and tensile testing are used to characterize healing.
