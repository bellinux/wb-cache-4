Rheumatoid synovial cells isolated from intact joints were notable for especially high proportions of macrophage-like cells and suppression of fibroblasts.

Design 1. 8 × 106 chondrocytes/cm 2 were seeded in 48 -multiwell plates. Thickness, cell number and cell distribution in pellet cross sections were documented over a 22 -day-long period. Alcian blue staining, type I and type II collagen staining, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to characterize cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) formation, and cell proliferation was demonstrated by Ki 67 staining. Furthermore, 2 -week-old chondrocyte pellets were co-cultured for additional 2 weeks with two human <b>synovial</b> fibroblast cell <b>lines</b> derived from a normal donor (non-invasive cell line) and a RA patient (invasive–aggressive (IA) cell line), respectively. ResultsChondrocyte pellets from 11 individual preparations showed a significant increase in pellet thickness from 44 ± 19 μm (day 3) to 282 ± 19 μm (day 22). Calculation of chondrocyte distribution, cell number and pellet thickness indicated that pellet growth was due to ECM formation and not cell proliferation. This was also confirmed by low numbers of Ki 67 positive chondrocytes and absence of cell clusters. HPLC, messenger RNA-analysis, histochemistry and antibody staining verified the expression of ECM components such as type II collagen, whereas type I collagen expression was very low. In contrast to the non-aggressive <b>synovial</b> fibroblast cell <b>line,</b> the IA <b>synovial</b> fibroblast cell <b>line</b> clearly showed cartilage invasion. ConclusionPellet formation of freshly isolated chondrocytes followed a reproducible developmental kinetics and showed typical immature hyaline cartilage properties.

Methods: 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, Annexin V propidium iodide (PI) staining, mitochondrial membrane potential assay, Triton X- 114 Phase partitioning, and immunolot for apoptosis signaling in SW 982 human <b>synovial</b> cell <b>line</b> were performed. Results: Fluvastatin induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in TNFα -stimulated SW 982 human synovial cells. A geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) inhibitor, but not a farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) inhibitor, induced apoptosis, and fluvastatin-induced apoptosis was associated with the translocation of isoprenylated RhoA and Rac 1 proteins from the cell membrane to the cytosol. Fluvastatin-induced downstream apoptotic signals were associated with inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt pathway. Accordingly, 89 kDa apoptotic cleavage fragment of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was detected. Interpretation & conclusions: Collectively, our data indicate that fluvastatin induces apoptotic cell death in TNFα-stimulated SW 982 human synovial cells through the inactivation of the geranylgerenylated membrane fraction of RhoA and Rac 1 proteins and the subsequent inhibition of the PI 3 K/Akt signaling pathway.

This study aimed to develop a reproducible method for quantifying the volume of <b>synovial</b> <b>lining</b> in chronic synovitis using contrast enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.  METHODS—The knees of 18  patients with chronic synovitis were examined (34  studies). A 2 D T 1 weighted FLASH sequence {{was used to evaluate}} the temporal enhancement of synovial structures after intravenous contrast. <b>Synovial</b> <b>lining</b> volume was calculated from subtraction of pre and post-enhancement 3 D T 1 weighted MP RAGE images with thresholding and pixel counting. Eleven patients were examined before and after intra-articular glucocorticoid (mean interval 14  weeks) and MR data compared with changes in clinical examination derived indices of disease activity.  RESULTS—Synovial lining volume varied from 52 - 267 ml. The coefficient of variation in volume calculation was 3. 5 % for a single observer and was 3. 8 % for two observers. <b>Synovial</b> <b>lining</b> volume was quantified in all patients where <b>synovial</b> <b>lining</b> thickening could not be detected clinically.

Twenty-five <b>synovial</b> cell <b>lines</b> were generated by interleukin 2 (IL- 2) expansion from synovial biopsies of patients with early SpA and RA, obtained from macroscopically inflamed synovial tissue by needle arthroscopy, and subsequently characterized by now cytometry for CD 3, CD 3, CD 8, L-selectin, CD 11 a, CD 31, CD 44, and alpha 4 beta 7 and alpha E beta 7 integrin.

Human epidermal growth factor was ultrastructurally localised to cytoplasm, especially to rough endoplasmic reticulum, of the <b>synovial</b> <b>lining</b> fibroblast-like (type B) cell.

When different histological variables were compared with each other a positive correlation was found between hEGF staining of the <b>synovial</b> <b>lining</b> layer and the degree of neovascularisation of rheumatoid synovium (r = 0. 72). Although some lymphocytes were weakly hEGF positive, neovascularisation did not correlate with the extent of lymphocyte infiltration or of hEGF staining of lymphocytes.

In {{a significant proportion}} of patients, surgical stabilization of the cervical spine offers the best opportunity for improvement of symptoms and long-term survival. We report two cases that illustrate some potential complications of cervical spine surgery and which also emphasize the need for vigilance when caring for patients in this group. KEY WORDS: Cervical myelopathy, Surgery. INVOLVEMENT of the cervical spine is common in inflammatory arthropathies. In rheumatoid arthritis, up to 85 % of those with moderate to severe disease will have X-ray changes in the cervical spine [1], although only a small proportion of these patients will be symptomatic. Symptoms range from mild discomfort in the occipito-cervical region to severe occipital pain, and from mild intermittent weakness to at worst sudden quadriparesis. Cervical spine involvement is usually defined according to the anatomical site, i. e. either atlanto-axial or subaxial, although both may co-exist in the same patient. Atlanto-axial disease is the most commonly observed type in rheumatoid arthritis and is due to damage to the transverse ligament and/or pannus formation at the <b>synovial</b> <b>lined</b> joint around the odontoid peg. Subluxation may be fixed or reducible and most often involves Cl moving forward on C 2. Surgical intervention is indicated if there is pro-gressive neurological deterioration or for intractable cervical/occipital pain. Untreated cervical spine disease with a neurological deficit carries a poor prognosis with up to 50 % of patients dying in the first 6 months of follow-up [2, 3]. Surgery to the cervical spine is not without substantial risks; these have been summarized in a recent review by Casey and Crockard [4]. Post-operative morbidity and mortality appear {{to be related to the}} degree of pre-existing neurological impairment [3].
