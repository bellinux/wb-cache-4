5|$|However, after {{less than}} a month back in York, William died, on 8 June 1154, {{allegedly}} due to poison administered in the chalice at Mass. One of William's clerks accused Osbert de Bayeux, an archdeacon of York, of the murder, and Osbert was summoned before the king to be tried at the royal court. Before the trial could take place, however, Stephen died, and the trial never took place. William was buried in York Minster and within a few months of his death, miracles were attributed to his intervention and a <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> came from his tomb when it was damaged during a fire. Nor was the body decayed or burnt in the fire. Pope Honorius III then ordered an investigation into the miracles. In 1227, he was canonised in Rome by Pope Honorius III.|$|E

40|$|Sweet" {{smells and}} tastes are {{perceptually}} similar, and physiological data indicate some commonality of central processing. However, sweet tastes and <b>sweet</b> <b>smells</b> {{do not provide}} interchangeable contexts in psychophysical experiments. The same sweet tastes are perceived as less intense when stronger sweet tastes are present, and they are perceived as more intense when weaker sweet tastes are present, as with <b>sweet</b> <b>smells.</b> However, complementary sets of <b>sweet</b> tastes and <b>smells</b> (e. g., weak sweet tastes, strong <b>sweet</b> <b>smells)</b> do not eliminate these differential context effects (DCEs). The present experiments examined, first, whether DCEs between <b>sweet</b> tastes and <b>smells</b> arise because of differences between odors and tastes {{in the way that}} sweetness scales with intensity as concentration rises, and, second, whether DCEs may be smaller for <b>sweet</b> tastes and <b>smells,</b> when contrasted with sweet tastes and nonsweet smells. The findings were clear: DCEs were consistently present, suggesting they are independent of perceptual similarity. These results imply that DCEs are probably not psychological in origin or centrally based; rather, they may have a subcortical locus. 10 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Benzene is {{a natural}} {{constituent}} of crude oil {{and is one of}} the elementary petrochemicals. Due to the cyclic continuous pi bond between the carbon atoms, benzene is classed as an aromatic hydrocarbon, the second -annulene (-annulene). It is sometimes abbreviated Ph–H. Benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a <b>sweet</b> <b>smell,</b> and is responsible for the aroma around petrol stations. It is used primarily as a precursor to the manufacture of chemicals with more complex structure, such as ethylbenzene and cumene, of which billions of kilograms are produced. As benzene has a high octane number, it is an important component of gasoline.|$|E
25|$|In {{some places}} in India, the corpse may {{be carried out}} of the house from the side door, rather than the front door so that the {{deceased}} does not find her way back in the house. If a woman dies during childbirth or during her menstrual cycle, her “corpse is anointed with five different products of the cow and special texts are recited.” In the Hilly regions, the place where a pregnant woman died is carefully scraped and the earth removed. The spot is then sown with mustard (sarson), which is also sprinkled along the road traversed by the corpse {{on its way to the}} burial ground. The reason behind this is that the mustard blossoms in the world of the dead, and the <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> pleases the spirit and keeps her content, so that she does not long to revisit her earthly home; secondly, the Churel rises from her grave at nightfall and seeks to return to her friends but when she sees the minute grains of the mustard scattered abroad and stoops to pick it up, and while she is engaged, the sun rises and she is unable to visit her home. This story also tells us that the Churel usually only comes out during the night.|$|E

500|$|Dicoumarol was {{a product}} of the plant {{molecule}} coumarin (not to be confused with Coumadin, a later tradename for warfarin). Coumarin is now known to be present in many plants, and produces the notably <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> of freshly cut grass or hay and plants like sweet grass; in fact, the plant's high content of coumarin is responsible for the original common name of [...] "sweet clover", which is named for its <b>sweet</b> <b>smell,</b> not its bitter taste. They are present notably in woodruff (Galium odoratum, Rubiaceae), and at lower levels in licorice, lavender, and various other species. However, coumarins themselves do not influence clotting or warfarin-like action, but must first be metabolized by various fungi into compounds such as 4-hydroxycoumarin, then further (in the presence of naturally occurring formaldehyde) into dicoumarol, in order to have any anticoagulant properties. Fungal attack of the damaged and dying clover stalks explained the presence of the anticoagulant only in spoiled clover silages; dicoumarol {{is considered to be a}} fermentation product and mycotoxin.|$|E
