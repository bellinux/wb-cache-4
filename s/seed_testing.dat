40|$|Many {{methods for}} {{automated}} software test generation, including some that explicitly use machine learning (and some that use ML more broadly conceived) derive new tests from existing tests (often {{referred to as}} seeds). Often, the <b>seed</b> <b>tests</b> from which new tests are derived are manually constructed, or at least simpler than the tests that are produced as the final outputs of such test generators.

40|$|Scaling {{symbolic}} execution to large programs or programs with complex inputs remains difficult due to path explosion and complex constraints, {{as well as}} external method calls. Additionally, creating an effective test structure with sym-bolic inputs can be difficult. A popular {{symbolic execution}} strategy in practice is to perform symbolic execution not “from scratch ” but based on existing test cases. This paper proposes that {{the effectiveness of this}} approach to symbolic execution can be enhanced by (1) reducing the size of <b>seed</b> <b>test</b> cases and (2) prioritizing <b>seed</b> <b>test</b> cases to maximize ex-ploration efficiency. The proposed test case reduction strat-egy is based on a recently introduced generalization of delta-debugging, and our prioritization techniques include novel methods that, for this purpose, can outperform some tradi-tional regression testing algorithms. We show that applying these methods can significantly improve the effectiveness of symbolic execution based on existing test cases...|$|R
