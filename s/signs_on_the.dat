5|$|Riley began sending poems to {{his brother}} again in February 1873. About {{the same time he}} and several friends began an {{advertisement}} company. The men traveled around Indiana creating large billboard-like <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sides of buildings and barns and in high places that would be visible from a distance. The company was financially successful, but Riley was continually drawn to poetry. In October he traveled to South Bend where he took a job at Stockford & Blowney painting verses on signs for a month; the short duration of his job may have been due to his frequent drunkenness at that time.|$|E

5|$|Upon the alphabet's acceptance, {{its first}} user was its {{principal}} architect, George D. Watt, who began writing the meeting {{minutes of the}} early Bishops in a cursive form of it in 1854. Almost immediately after its publication, church members began experimenting with it, and by 1855 travel writers Jules Remy and Julius Brenchley published a chart of the new alphabet which differed heavily from the 1854 version. Some early Mormons, such as Thales Hastings Haskell, began writing their personal journals in the new alphabet. Remy further reported that during his time in Salt Lake City, he saw <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street and above shops using the new alphabet.|$|E
5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 {{shows that there}} is a difference between most of the hieroglyphic signs and the <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right third of the figure on the outer edge as well as the outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, to the rest of the text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the outer edge. An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E

25|$|Until 1980, {{streetcar}} routes had names but not numbers. When the CLRVs were introduced, the TTC assigned route {{numbers in}} the 500 series. CLRVs have a single front rollsign showing various combinations of route number and destination, while PCC streetcars showed a route identifier (route name until the 1980s and later route number) and destination on two separate front rollsigns. The digital destination <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new Flexity Outlook streetcars show route number, route name and destination.

25|$|The {{station has}} two tracks, one center island {{platform}} and two disused side platforms extending south, ending {{a short distance}} north of 213th Street. The tracks end at bumper blocks {{at the north end}} of the platforms. The station was formerly set up as a Spanish solution with alighting passengers using the side platforms and boarding passengers using the island platform in a style similar to the other Bronx IRT terminals. Now all passengers use the island platform. There are old style <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> center platform built from the ground up.|$|E
25|$|Initial consonants {{are in the}} leftmost column; vowels are in the top row {{beneath the}} title. The {{transcription}} of the syllable (it {{may not have been}} pronounced that way) is listed next to the sign along with Bennett's identifying number for the sign preceded by an asterisk (as was Ventris' and Chadwick's convention). In cases where the transcription of the sign remains in doubt, Bennett's number serves to identify the sign. The <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tablets and sealings often show considerable variation from each other and from the representations below.

25|$|Shortly after this, {{the numbers}} started {{to appear in}} road atlases and on <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roads themselves, {{converting}} them into a tool for motorists {{in addition to their}} use for determining funding. The numbers of the roads changed quite frequently {{during the early years of}} the system as it was a period of heavy expansion of the network and some numbered routes did not follow the most usual routes taken. The Trunk Roads Act 1936 gave the Ministry direct control of the major routes and a new classification system was created to identify these routes. Originally these numbers beginning in T were to be made public, however this was eventually deemed unnecessary.|$|E
