25|$|Bilingualism {{involves}} the use of two languages by an individual or community. Neuroimaging studies of bilingualism generally focus on a comparison of activated areas when using the first language (L1) and <b>second</b> <b>language</b> (<b>L2).</b>|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{there are}} {{approximately}} 75 territories where English is spoken either as a first language (L1) or as an unofficial or institutionalized <b>second</b> <b>language</b> (<b>L2)</b> in fields such as government, law and education. It is difficult to establish {{the total number of}} Englishes in the world, as new varieties of English are constantly being developed and discovered.|$|E
2500|$|While [...] "Mother Tongue" [...] {{generally}} {{refers to}} the first language (L1) elsewhere, {{it is used to}} denote the [...] "ethnic language" [...] or the <b>second</b> <b>language</b> (<b>L2)</b> in Singapore. Prior to 1 January 2011, the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Singapore defined [...] "Mother Tongue" [...] not as the home language or the first language acquired by the student but by his/her father's ethnicity. For example, a child born to a Hokkien-speaking Chinese father and Tamil-speaking Indian mother would automatically be assigned to take Mandarin as the Mother Tongue language.|$|E
50|$|In another paper, Cook and Li (2009) {{examined}} {{the ways to}} categorise language users into various groups. They suggested two theories: one by Siegel (2006) who used 'sociolinguistic settings', {{which is based on}} the notion of dominant language, and another one by de Swaan (2001) that used the concept of hierarchy in the global language system. According to them, de Swaan's hierarchy is more appropriate, as it does not imply dominance in power terms. Rather, de Swaan's applies the concepts of geography and function to group languages and hence language users according to the global language system. De Swaan (2001) views the acquisition of <b>second</b> <b>languages</b> (<b>L2)</b> as typically going up the hierarchy.|$|R
50|$|Interlanguage is {{the term}} for an ideolect that has been {{developed}} by a learner of a <b>second</b> <b>language</b> (or <b>L2)</b> which preserves some features of their first language (or L1), and can also overgeneralize some L2 writing and speaking rules. These two characteristics of an interlanguage result in the system's unique linguistic organization.|$|R
50|$|A person's <b>second</b> <b>{{language}}</b> or <b>L2,</b> is a <b>language</b> {{that is not}} {{the native}} language of the speaker, but that is used in the locale of that person. In contrast, a foreign language is a language that is learned in an area where that language is not generally spoken. Some languages, often called auxiliary languages, are used primarily as <b>second</b> <b>languages</b> or lingua francas.|$|R
2500|$|While English is {{the core}} {{language}} of instruction in government schools, mother tongue languages are taught on a weekly basis. While [...] "mother tongue" [...] typically correlates to the first language (L1) overseas, in Singapore, the Ministry of Education refers {{to it as the}} [...] "ethnic language" [...] or the <b>second</b> <b>language</b> (<b>L2).</b> Singapore's language planning is known as exogenous planning, whereby a foreign language takes on the role as the main language of communication against the indigenous languages in the country. The education system aims to create a workforce that is bi-literate in English and Chinese/Malay/Tamil.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} whether the presentation of words in a sentence context restricts lexical access to words of the target language only are most studied in bilinguals' <b>second</b> <b>language</b> (<b>L2)</b> processing. This sentence context effect might be an efficient strategy to speed up lexical search, because it reduces the number of lexical candidates. For example, Elston-Guttler et al. showed that cross-lingual activation is very sensitive {{to the influence of}} a sentence context and previous activation state of the two languages in a semantic priming study. In their study, German-English bilinguals were presented with relatively low-constraint sentences in which a homograph (e.g., The woman gave her friend a pretty GIFT; gift means poison in German) or a control word was presented at the end (e.g., The woman gave her friend a pretty SHELL). [...] "Constraint" [...] means {{the degree to which the}} sentence frame preceding the target word biased that word. The sentence was then replaced by a target word (poison) for lexical decision task. They found that only for participants who saw a German film prior to experiment and only in the first block of the experiment, participants could recognize the target faster after primed with the related homograph sentence than primed with the controlled sentence. This suggests that bilinguals can quickly [...] "zoom into" [...] the L2 processing situation even the L1 activation was boosted.|$|E

50|$|Language {{teaching}} practice often {{assumes that}} most of the difficulties that learners face in the study of English are a consequence {{of the degree to which}} their native language differs from English (a contrastive analysis approach). A native speaker of Chinese, for example, may face many more difficulties than a native speaker of German, because German is more closely related to English than Chinese is. This may be true for anyone of any mother tongue (also called first language, normally abbreviated L1) setting out to learn any other language (called a target <b>language,</b> <b>second</b> <b>language</b> or <b>L2).</b> See also <b>second</b> <b>language</b> acquisition (SLA) for mixed evidence from linguistic research.|$|R
5000|$|The {{study of}} {{language}} attrition became a subfield of linguistics with a 1980 {{conference at the}} University of Pennsylvania called [...] "Loss of Language Skills". The aim of the conference was to discuss areas of <b>second</b> <b>language,</b> or <b>L2,</b> attrition and to ideate on possible future research. The conference revealed that attrition is a wide topic, with numerous factors and taking many forms. Decades later, the field of first language attrition gained new momentum with two conferences held in Amsterdam in 2002 and 2005, {{as well as a}} series of graduate workshops and panels at international conferences, such as the International Symposium on Bilingualism (2007, 2009), the annual conferences of the European <b>Second</b> <b>Language</b> Association, and the AILA World Congress (2008). The outcomes of some of these meetings were later published in edited volumes.|$|R
5000|$|The age {{at which}} {{speakers}} begin to immerse themselves into a language (such as English) {{is linked to the}} degree in which native speakers are able to detect a non-native accent; the exact nature of the link is disputed amongst scholars and may be affected by [...] "neurological plasticity, cognitive development, motivation, psychosocial states, formal instruction, language learning aptitude", and the usage of their first (L1) and <b>second</b> (<b>L2)</b> <b>languages.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{generative}} {{approach to}} <b>second</b> <b>language</b> (<b>L2)</b> acquisition applies theoretical insights developed from within generative linguistics to investigate how second languages are learned by adults and children. Research is conducted in syntax, phonology, morphology, phonetics and semantics.|$|E
50|$|There is {{variation}} in {{the period in which}} learning must take place for bilingualism to be considered simultaneous. Generally, the term sequential bilingualism applies only if the child is approximately three years old before being introduced to the <b>second</b> <b>language</b> (<b>L2).</b>|$|E

50|$|Immersion {{programs}} {{provide a}} sociolinguistic setting that facilitates second-language acquisition. Immersion programs are educational programs where children are instructed in an <b>L2</b> <b>language.</b> Although {{the language of}} instruction is the <b>L2</b> <b>language,</b> the curriculum parallels that of non-immersion programs and clear support exists in the L1 language, as the teachers are all bilingual. The goal of these programs {{is to develop a}} high level of proficiency in both the L1 and <b>L2</b> <b>languages.</b> Students in immersion programs have been shown to have greater levels of proficiency in their <b>second</b> <b>language</b> than students who receive <b>second</b> <b>language</b> education only as a subject in school. This is especially true in terms of their receptive skills. Also, students who join immersion programs earlier generally have greater second-language proficiency than their peers who join later. However, students who join later have been shown to gain native-like proficiency. Although immersion students' receptive skills are especially strong, their productive skills may suffer if they spend the majority of their time listening to instruction only. Grammatical skills and the ability to have precise vocabulary are particular areas of struggle. It is argued that immersion is necessary, but not sufficient for the development of native-like proficiency in a <b>second</b> <b>language.</b> Opportunities to engage in sustained conversation, and assignments that encourage syntactical, as well as semantic development help develop the productive skills necessary for bilingual proficiency.|$|R
50|$|Second-language {{acquisition}} (SLA), second-language learning, or <b>L2</b> (<b>language</b> 2) acquisition, is {{the process}} by which people learn a <b>second</b> <b>language.</b> Second-language acquisition is also the scientific discipline devoted to studying that process. The field of second-language acquisition is a subdiscipline of applied linguistics, but also receives research attention from a variety of other disciplines, such as psychology and education.|$|R
50|$|The {{language}} {{needs of}} these children vary from student to student, and is dependent {{on a number of}} factors, including: length of stay in Japan; contact with Japanese prior to, during and after school; their parents own ideas about the Japanese language and Japanese schooling; and services available to them in their first language (L1) and in Japanese - the <b>second</b> <b>language</b> (<b>L2)</b> - at their schools.|$|E
50|$|The {{defining}} {{difference between}} a first language (L1) and a <b>second</b> <b>language</b> (<b>L2)</b> is the age the person learned the language. For example, linguist Eric Lenneberg used second language to mean a language consciously acquired or used by its speaker after puberty. In most cases, people never achieve {{the same level of}} fluency and comprehension in their second languages as in their first language. These views are closely associated with the critical period hypothesis.|$|E
5000|$|Students {{in primary}} and {{secondary}} schools learning English as the language of instruction also learn a second language called their [...] "Mother Tongue" [...] by the Ministry of Education, where they are either taught Mandarin Chinese, Malay or Tamil.

50|$|How {{children}} acquire {{native language}} (L1) and {{the relevance of}} this to foreign <b>language</b> (<b>L2)</b> learning has long been debated. Although evidence for L2 learning ability declining with age is controversial, a common notion is that children learn L2s easily, whilst older learners rarely achieve fluency. This assumption stems from ‘critical period’ (CP) ideas. A CP was popularised by Eric Lenneberg in 1967 for L1 acquisition, but considerable interest now surrounds age effects on second-language acquisition (SLA). SLA theories explain learning processes and suggest causal factors for a possible CP for <b>second</b> <b>language</b> acquisition. These SLA-CP theories mainly attempt to explain apparent differences in language aptitudes of children and adults by distinct learning routes, and clarify these differences by discussing psychological mechanisms. Research explores these ideas and hypotheses, but results are varied: some demonstrate pre-pubescent children acquire language easily, and some that older learners have the advantage, whilst others focus on existence of a CP for SLA. Recent studies (e.g. Mayberry and Lock, 2003) have recognised certain aspects of SLA may be affected by age, whilst others remain intact. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate whether capacity for vocabulary acquisition decreases with age.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} found that a bilingual's two {{languages}} are simultaneously active, both phonologically and semantically, during language use. This activation is indicated by electrophysiological measures of performance. Not only is a person's dominant language (L1) active when using the less dominant <b>language</b> (<b>L2),</b> but their L2 is also activated when using L1. This happens once the individual is adequately proficient in the L2. They are both active when listening to speech, reading words in either language or even planning speech in either language. Also, both languages are activated even when only one language is needed by the user.|$|R
5000|$|One {{view is that}} of the {{linguist}} Noam Chomsky in what he calls the human language acquisition device—a mechanism which enables an individual to recreate correctly the rules and certain other characteristics of language used by speakers around the learner. [...] This device, according to Chomsky, wears out over time, and is not normally available by puberty, which he uses to explain the poor results some adolescents and adults have when learning aspects of a <b>second</b> <b>language</b> (<b>L2).</b>|$|E

50|$|Contrastive Analysis {{was used}} {{extensively}} {{in the field of}} Second Language Acquisition (SLA) in the 1960s and early 1970s, as a method of explaining why some features of a target language were more difficult to acquire than others. According to the behaviourist theories prevailing at the time, language learning was a question of habit formation, and this could be reinforced or impeded by existing habits. Therefore, the difficulty in mastering certain structures in a <b>second</b> <b>language</b> (<b>L2)</b> depended on the difference between the learners' mother language (L1) and the language they were trying to learn.|$|E
50|$|In second-language acquisition, the Acculturation Model is {{a theory}} {{proposed}} by John Schumann to describe the acquisition process of a <b>second</b> <b>language</b> (<b>L2)</b> by members of ethnic minorities that typically include immigrants, migrant workers, or the children of such groups. This acquisition process takes place in natural contexts of majority language setting.
