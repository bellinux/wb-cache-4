25|$|Dōgen Zenji (道元禅師; 19 January 1200 22 September 1253), {{also known}} as Dōgen Kigen (道元希玄), Eihei Dōgen (永平道元), Koso Joyo Daishi (高祖承陽大師), or Bussho Dento Kokushi (仏性伝東国師), was a Japanese Buddhist priest, writer, poet, philosopher, {{and founder of the}} Sōtō school of Zen in Japan. Originally ordained as a monk in the Tendai School in Kyoto, he was {{ultimately}} dissatisfied with its teaching and traveled to China to seek out what he believed to be a more authentic Buddhism. He remained there for five years, finally training under Tiantong Rujing, an eminent teacher of the Chinese Caodong lineage. Upon his return to Japan, he began promoting the meditation practice of zazen through literary works such as Fukan zazengi and Bendōwa. He eventually broke relations completely with the powerful Tendai School, and, after several years of likely friction between himself and the establishment, left Kyoto for the mountainous countryside where he founded the monastery Eihei-ji, which remains the head temple of the Sōtō <b>school</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
25|$|Blind Brook High School {{opened its}} doors {{in the fall of}} 1973. The {{construction}} of the Blind Brook School District's first high school came about after the community (which was the unincorporated area of the Town of Rye at the time) wanted to expand the local school district, District #5. This push for expansion started after the community became frustrated about spending lots of money {{to send their children to}} local high schools including Port Chester, Mamaroneck, Rye Neck, and Valhalla, without commensurate representation or influence on those districts' policies and programs. In addition, the Ridge Street School, which housed classes from kindergarten to 8th/9th grades, was becoming overcrowded and could not accommodate the growing population that would become known as Rye Brook (in 1982). Land was purchased on King Street, and construction was started in 1972 and ended in late 1973, months into the school year. The high <b>school</b> <b>today</b> stands on the same campus as in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Two {{decades after}} the College of New Jersey (now known as Princeton University) was {{established}} in 1746 by the New Light Presbyterians, ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church, seeking autonomy in ecclesiastical affairs in the American colonies, sought to establish a college to train {{those who wanted to}} become ministers within the church. Through several years of effort by the Rev. Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen (1691–1747) and Rev. Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh (1736–1790), later the college's first president, Queen's College received its charter on November 10, 1766 from New Jersey's last Royal Governor, William Franklin (1730–1813), the illegitimate son of Founding Father Benjamin Franklin. The original charter established the college under the corporate name the trustees of Queen's College, in New-Jersey, named in honor of King George III's Queen consort, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1744–1818), and created both the college and the Queen's College Grammar School, intended to be a preparatory school affiliated and governed by the college. The Grammar <b>School,</b> <b>today</b> the private Rutgers Preparatory School, {{was a part of the}} college community until 1959. New Brunswick was chosen as the location over Hackensack because the New Brunswick Dutch had the support of the Anglican population, making the royal charter easier to obtain.|$|E
