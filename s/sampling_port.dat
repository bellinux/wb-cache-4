50|$|Similar to TOC, SEM {{particle}} analysis {{represents a}} lower cost alternative to the expensive online measurements and therefore it is commonly a method of choice in less critical applications. SEM analysis can provide particle counting for particle size down to 50 nm, which generally is in-line with the capability of online instruments. The test involves installation of the SEM capture filter cartridge on the UPW <b>sampling</b> <b>port</b> for sampling on the membrane disk with the pore size equal or smaller than the target size of the UPW particles. The filter is then transferred to the SEM microscope where its surface is scanned for detection and identification of the particles. The main disadvantage of SEM analysis is long sampling time. Depending on the pore size and the pressure in the UPW system, the sampling time can be between one week and one month. However, typical robustness and stability of the particle filtration systems allow for successful applications of the SEM method. Application of Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) provides compositional analysis of the particles, making SEM also helpful for systems with on-line particle counters.|$|E

40|$|This study compares resuable and {{disposable}} individually ventilated mouse cages {{in terms}} of the formation of intracage CO 2 and NH 3. Crl:CD- 1 (ICR) female mice were placed in either disposable or reusable ventilated cages in a positive pressure animal rack.

Results indicated higher CO 2 levels {{in the rear of the}} disposable cages and in the front of the reusable cages. This pattern corresponded to where the mice tended to congregate. However, CO 2 concentrations did not differ significantly between the 2 cage types. Average CO 2 levels in both cage types never exceeded approximately 3000 ppm.

40|$|There {{are well}} {{documented}} methods for stack emissions monitoring. These are {{all based on}} stack <b>sampling</b> through <b>sampling</b> <b>ports</b> in well defined conditions. Once sampled, the molecules are quantified in instruments that often use optical techniques. Unfortunately <b>sampling</b> <b>ports</b> are not found on all stacks/ducts {{or the use of}} the <b>sampling</b> <b>ports</b> cannot be planned efficiently because of operational constraints or the emissions monitoring equipment cannot be driven to a remote stack/duct.

Standoff absorption and Raman will be discussed and results from a field campaign will be presented along with short descriptions of the apparatus. In the first phase of these tests, the molecules that were targeted were NO and O 2. Spatially resolved optical measurements allow for standoff identification and quantification of molecules, much like the standardized methods, {{except for the fact that}} it is not done in the stack, but in the plume formed by the emissions from the stack.

However, a markedly nitrite accumulation occurred along flowpath of the methanol-fed DNBF, and the average nitrite up to 5.11  mg /L at the outlet of the reactor. The elevated level of nitrite along the flowpath of methanol-fed DNBF might decrease the denitrification rate or take further time to achieve complete removal of nitrite, for the reaction catalyzed by the nitrite reductase enzyme is considered as the limiting stage for anoxic denitrification process (Guven 2009).|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} of groundwater and gas monitoring data is provided between multilevel and conven-tional long-screened boreholes constructed {{around the perimeter}} of a closed landfill in the English Midlands. Multilevel boreholes were constructed with up to seven separate <b>sampling</b> <b>ports.</b> All boreholes were constructed into strata of the Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group, which proved to consist of a succession of well-bedded, weathered mudstone and clay with occasional thin beds of siltstone and sandstone to approximately 30 m depth. These are low-permeability strata which exhibit sufficient fracture permeability to allow groundwater movement. It is suspected that fractures, particularly along bedding planes, provide discrete pathways for both gas and leachate migration from the landfill. The importance of purging channels prior to sampling both aqueous and vapour phases is empha-sised in order to minimise diffusion biases. Monitoring records for the multilevel boreholes demonstrate that there are significant vertical differ-ences in groundwater level, and groundwater chemistry. A predominantly downward vertical hydrau-lic gradient is proven in all the multilevel boreholes, with a head difference of up to 5 metres over a vertical distance of 13 metres between uppermost and lowest <b>sampling</b> <b>ports.</b> Chloride concentration in groundwater varies from a background of below 50 mg/L to in excess of 700 mg/L within ports of the same multilevel borehole.
