25|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of layers}} of gas atoms (such as oxygen) onto the emitter surface, {{or part of}} it, can create surface electric dipoles that change the local work function {{of this part of}} the surface. This affects the FEM image; also, the change of work-function can be measured using a Fowler-Nordheim plot (see below). Thus, the FEM became an early observational tool of <b>surface</b> <b>science.</b> For example, in the 1960s, FEM results contributed significantly to discussions on heterogeneous catalysis. FEM has also been used for studies of surface-atom diffusion. However, FEM has now been almost completely superseded by newer surface-science techniques.|$|E
25|$|Science is a {{magnificent}} force, {{but it is}} not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessel. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius; it has made war more terrible than it ever was before. Man used to be content to slaughter his fellowmen on a single plane, the earth's <b>surface.</b> <b>Science</b> has taught him to go down into the water and shoot up from below and to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach brotherly love. Science has made war so hellish that civilization was about to commit suicide; and now we are told that newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of wars that may come in the future. If civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene. His teachings, and His teachings alone, can solve the problems that vex the heart and perplex the world.|$|E

It is unique {{in its attempt to}} treat the physics of surfaces, thin films and interfaces, surface chemistry, thermodynamics, statistical physics and the physics of the solid/electrolyte interface in an integral manner, rather than in separate compartments. The Physics of Surfaces and Interfaces is designed as a handbook for the researcher as well as a study-text for graduate students in physics or chemistry with special interest in the <b>surface</b> <b>sciences,</b> material science, or the nanosciences. The experienced researcher, professional or academic teacher will appreciate the opportunity to share many insights and ideas that have grown out of the author's long experience. Readers will likewise appreciate the wide range of topics treated, each supported by extensive references. Graduate students will benefit from the elementary introductions to experimental techniques and the clear presentations of the theory behind the techniques and the phenomena. Wherever possible, physical concepts are emphasized and the mathematical notation kept to a minimum; the verbal explanations are supported by 350 graphs and illustrations...|$|R

2500|$|Irving Langmuir [...] (January 31, 1881 – August 16, 1957) was an American chemist and physicist. His {{most famous}} {{publication}} is the 1919 article [...] "The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules" [...] in which, building on Gilbert N.

Langmuir became {{embroiled in a}} priority dispute with Lewis over this work; Langmuir's presentation skills were {{largely responsible for the}} popularization of the theory, although the credit for the theory itself belongs mostly to Lewis. While at General Electric from 1909 to 1950, Langmuir advanced several fields of physics and chemistry, invented the gas-filled incandescent lamp and the hydrogen welding technique, and was awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in surface chemistry. The Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research near Socorro, New Mexico, was named in his honor, as was the American Chemical Society journal for <b>surface</b> <b>science</b> called Langmuir.|$|E
2500|$|Coordinated ligands display {{reactivity}} {{distinct from}} the free ligands. [...] For example, the acidity of the ammonia ligands in 3+ is elevated relative to NH3 itself. [...] Alkenes bound to metal cations are reactive toward nucleophiles whereas alkenes normally are not. [...] The large and industrially important area of catalysis hinges {{on the ability of}} metals to modify the reactivity of organic ligands. [...] Homogeneous catalysis occurs in solution and heterogeneous catalysis occurs when gaseous or dissolved substrates interact with surfaces of solids. [...] Traditionally homogeneous catalysis is considered part of organometallic chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis is discussed in the context of <b>surface</b> <b>science,</b> a subfield of solid state chemistry. [...] But the basic inorganic chemical principles are the same. [...] Transition metals, almost uniquely, react with small molecules such as CO, H2, O2, and C2H4. [...] The industrial significance of these feedstocks drives the active area of catalysis. [...] Ligands can also undergo ligand transfer reactions such as transmetalation.|$|E
