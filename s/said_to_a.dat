25|$|The {{litigation}} was {{spearheaded by}} lobbyist Laurie Cardoza-Moore, who {{demanded that the}} Rutherford County sheriff investigate a supposed conspiracy linking the mosque with Islamic militants in Somalia and Gaza.

Cardoza-Moore led a group called Proclaiming Justice To The Nation (PJTN), which funded the lawsuit via donations. Some of the donors were called as witnesses in the hearing. One witness admitted that PJTN had paid him thousands of dollars to read to the court extracts from anti-Muslim Internet websites.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} is explicitly {{told that he}} is reacting normally to extreme stress {{and is expected to}} recover and return to full duty in a few hours or days. A military leader is extremely effective in this area of treatment. Of all the things <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Service member suffering from combat stress, the words of his small-unit leader have the greatest impact due to the positive bonding process that occurs during combat. Simple statements from the small-unit leader to the Service member that he is reacting normally to combat stress and is expected back soon have positive impact. Small-unit leaders should tell Service members that their comrades need and expect them to return. When they do return, the unit treats them as every other Service member and expects them to perform well. Service members suffering and recovering from combat stress disorder are no more likely to become overloaded again than are those who have not yet been overloaded. In fact, {{they are less likely to}} become overloaded than inexperienced replacements.|$|E
25|$|On October 11, 1872 Edwards Pierrepont {{spoke in}} Ithaca, New York {{supporting}} President Grant and the Republican ticket. Pierrepont related {{a story of}} President Grant unworried he would not win North Carolina. Although there was concern that Grant would not win North Carolina, Pierrepont stated that Grant had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> friend when wolves howl at night the sound {{is greater than the}} actual number of wolves. According to President Grant, this was the case in North Carolina. Pierrepont predicted Grant would win New York for seven reasons including that Grant had already won the state in 1868 when the Democratic coalition was at its height, the Republicans had carried the state government, and that Grant would receive 17,000 votes from African Americans. Pierrepont stated the Tammany Ring would no longer be instrumental in securing the Democratic vote through fraud. Pierrepont had earlier been instrumental in prosecuting the Tammany Ring that was completely shut down. With the prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan by President Grant and Pierrepont's shutting down the Tammany Ring, the general election of 1872 {{was one of the most}} fair in United States history.|$|E

Some day, though, I'd like to make another movie that kids could go and see."

500|$|The Peterloo Massacre {{has been}} {{called one of the}} {{defining}} moments of its age. Many of those present at the massacre, including local masters, employers and owners, were horrified by the carnage. One of the casualties, Oldham cloth-worker and ex-soldier John Lees, who died from his wounds on 9 September, had been present at the Battle of Waterloo. Shortly before his death he <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> friend that he had never been in such danger as at Peterloo: [...] "At Waterloo there was man to man but there it was downright murder."

500|$|On 19 May the {{squadron}} flew night operations owing to German air superiority. MacLachlan flew a raid against Givet, on the French-Belgian border; his only action {{in support of}} Allied forces in the Battle of Belgium. He was ordered to fly daylight missions on 21 May near the Somme where German Panzer units were seen to be moving. The squadron claimed one German tank destroyed.

I'm going to the C.O and ask to be recrewed"—the commanding officer approved his request. On his next mission Hardy was shot down and killed in action with his new pilot. MacLachaln then took a new gunner, Les Davies who later flew night fighters.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1950–51 NBA season, Walter Brown, {{owner of}} the Boston Celtics, was desperate to turn around his {{struggling}} and financially strapped franchise, which was reeling from a 22–46 record. Brown, in characteristic candor, <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gathering of local Boston sportswriters, [...] "Boys, I don't know anything about basketball. Who would you recommend I hire as coach?" [...] The group vociferously answered that he get the recently available Auerbach, and Brown complied. In the 1950 NBA draft, Auerbach made some notable moves. First, he famously snubbed Hall-of-Fame New England point guard Bob Cousy in the 1950 NBA draft, infuriating the Boston crowd. He argued that the flashy Cousy lacked the poise necessary to make his team, taunting him as a [...] "local yokel". Second, he drafted African-American Chuck Cooper, the first black player to be drafted by an NBA club. With that, Auerbach effectively broke down the color barrier in professional basketball.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Bellman {{writes that}} modern concert {{performance}} style—set in the [...] "conservatory" [...] tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings—militates against {{what is known}} of Chopin's more intimate performance technique. The composer himself <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pupil that [...] "concerts are never real music, {{you have to give}} up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art." [...] Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as [...] "always crescendo to a high note", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring. [...] Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin [...] "has created a kind of chromatic embroidery... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn". Hiller wrote that [...] "What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers." ...|$|E

[...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day we broke up.

Nevertheless, as Hogan predicted, the team defeated the Moguls, with a final score of 11–8.

500|$|When the Cuban {{government}} blocked {{access to}} Sánchez's blog from the island, it also blocked {{access to the}} DesdeCuba website, where these other blogs were housed. The other bloggers faced the same challenges Sánchez had in maintaining their blogs, and also needed to find ways around the censorship—either relying on friends with access inside Cuba from their government offices, using complex and time-consuming workarounds to find 'back doors' into their blogs, or reaching out to friends and strangers abroad who volunteered to help, [...] and who posted email blog entries they {{would never be able}} to see. [...] With their blogs targeted to Cuban readers on the island, the discouragement was compounded by knowing that even if they could post, their readers could not read the posts. This limitation was circumvented by making copies of the blogs on CDs, either from computers on the island with access to the website, or sent from friends abroad.
