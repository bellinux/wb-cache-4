5|$|The show on June 14, 2002 at the United Spirit Arena in Lubbock, Texas was {{cancelled}} due to {{a transformer}} blowing out during the 2nd song which put the whole show on auxiliary power making it unsafe for <b>Spears</b> <b>and</b> the entire production team to continue.

5|$|The video {{opens with}} <b>Spears</b> <b>and</b> her {{friends in a}} hotel room, where a tabloid {{reporter}} on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she's often seen wearing publicly. <b>Spears</b> <b>and</b> her friends express their disagreement with the report. Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes {{a phone call to}} her bodyguard, and using a cloth to disguise the sound of her voice, coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and fool around briefly with the security cameras before going up to the main lobby. A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine {{in the middle of the}} rain. As they make their entrance, they're dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.|$|E

5|$|Triarii (singular: Triarius) {{were one}} of the {{elements}} of the early Roman military manipular legions of the early Roman Republic (509 BC – 107 BC). They were the oldest and among the wealthiest men in the army and could afford high quality equipment. They wore heavy metal armor and carried large shields, their usual position being the third battle line. They were equipped with <b>spears</b> <b>and</b> were considered to be elite soldiers among the legion.|$|E
5|$|Woolly mammoth ivory {{was used}} to create art objects. Several Venus figurines, {{including}} the Venus of Brassempouy and the Venus of Lespugue, were made from this material. Weapons made from ivory, such as daggers, <b>spears,</b> <b>and</b> a boomerang, are also known. To be able to process the ivory, the large tusks had to be chopped, chiselled and split into smaller, more manageable pieces. Some ivory artefacts show that tusks had been straightened, and it is unknown how this was achieved.|$|E
5|$|A {{major change}} from The Two Towers is the {{interactive}} {{nature of the}} game environments. The player can operate machinery, for example bridges and catapults, to complete objectives, and use environmental objects as weapons, such as <b>spears</b> <b>and</b> cauldrons, to kill enemies. The levels are also {{twice the size of}} the largest level from The Two Towers and many are less linear. Unlike The Two Towers, The Return of the King features a co-op mode, allowing two players to play through the game together. The North American PlayStation 2 version also has an online multiplayer mode, with USB headset support, although this was removed from the European version of the game.|$|E

5|$|At first, Raziel can jump, glide {{using his}} torn wings, move blocks, {{and pick up}} and throw objects and enemies. Initially unarmed, he fights using his claws, but can {{alternatively}} use weapons such as rocks, torches, <b>spears</b> <b>and</b> staffs, and the Soul Reaver. Raziel can freely shift to the spectral realm, but can return to the material realm only through special portals when at full health. Raziel automatically shifts to the spectral realm if he runs out of health. As the game progresses, Raziel gains the powers of his clan brothers after defeating them and becomes able to phase through gates in the spectral realm and climb walls in the material realm. Initially vulnerable to water, he overcomes this weakness and learns to swim.|$|E
5|$|Brough, {{guarded by}} six knights, {{put up a}} strong resistance, but William took the outer defences and then besieged the keep, {{threatening}} to execute the garrison if the castle was not surrendered. The keep was set on fire, forcing the surrender of the garrison, including one knight who, according to the chronicler Jordan Fantosme, fought on first with <b>spears</b> <b>and</b> then wooden stakes, until finally overwhelmed. William then destroyed the remaining defences of the castle using Flemish mercenary troops. Henry II's forces defeated William {{at the battle of}} Alnwick and Brough Castle was recovered later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Each unit is {{assigned}} a character class, while affects their assigned weapon, strengths and weaknesses, and range {{and speed of}} movement on the battlefield. These classes range from axemen and swordsmen to thieves, to mounted units and magic users such as healers. Some characters, such as main protagonist Leif, have unique classes. Classes also naturally evolve {{during the course of}} the story. Mounted units have the option of dismounting their steeds to fight on-foot. Weapons within a unit's selected character class can be freely swapped out for more powerful versions: when mounted units dismount, they swap spears for axes or swords. Weapon effectiveness is governed by the Weapons Triangle: swords are strong against axes, axes against <b>spears,</b> <b>and</b> spears against swords.|$|E
