Being Jewish, antisemitic German-Nationalist organizations {{prevented him from}} getting an engineering job in Vienna, so he obtained employment with the English recording technology firm (Gramaphone Company, EMI from March 1931) operating under its His Master's Voice brand in Belgrade. His task there was to eliminate radio interference on the music broadcast system on trains running from Belgrade to Niś. The project was a technical success but a financial failure because the Serbian railroad could only pay HMV by barter in grain, not pounds sterling, due a foreign exchange crisis. As a result, he {{had to return to}} Vienna. He was still prevented from working as an engineer, but he found work as a journalist and printer, first at Randfunk (which developed a low-cost method of tabulating a radio program guide at the printer) and eventually landing at a social-democratic publisher, Vorwärts. The experience in printing proved crucial later. However, after the 1934 putsch by Austrian fascists and due to social-democratic nature of Vorwärts it was shut down. Working independently, he patented some ideas from his doctorate at the university (on graphical sound recording and <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>television)</b> and leveraged them to obtain a visa to visit England to offer the patents to companies there in 1936. His first cousin, Philipp Fehl, contacted Eisler upon arrival as a refugee in England and Eisler helped to make sure that Fehl's father left Vienna alive after his release from the Dachau concentration camp.|$|E

The first 3D TV was produced in 1935, and stereoscopic 3D still cameras for personal use had already become fairly common by the Second World War. Many 3D movies were produced for theatrical release in the US during the 1950s just when television started to become popular.

Alfred Hitchcock produced his film Dial M for Murder in 3D, but for the purpose of maximizing profits the movie was released in 2D because not all cinemas were able to display 3D films. In 1946 the Soviet Union also developed 3D films, with Robinzon Kruzo being its first full-length 3D movie. People were excited to view the 3D movies, but were put off by their poor quality. Because of this, their popularity declined quickly.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} {{disparity}} estimation and {{the reconstruction of}} intermediate views from stereoscopic images. Using block-wise maximum-likelihood (ML) disparity estimation, {{it was found that}} the Laplacian model outperformed the Cauchy and Gaussian models in terms of disparity compensation errors and the number of correspondence matches. The disparity values in occluded regions were then determined using both object-based and reliability-based interpolation. Finally, an adaptive technique was used to interpolate the intermediate views. One distinguishing characteristic of this algorithm is that the left and right-eye images were projected onto the plane of the intermediate view to be reconstructed. This resulted in two projected images. The intermediate view was created using a weighted average of these two projected images with the weights based on the quality of the corresponding areas of the projected images. Subjective exami-nation of the reconstructed images indicate that they have high image quality and good stable depth when viewed stereoscopically. An objective evaluation with the test image sequence “Flower Garden ” shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve a peak signal-to-noise ratio gain of around 1 dB, when compared to a reference algorithm.

A geometrical model of TV stereoscopy is presented which describes the influence of variations of the three video system parameters on retinal disparities. Experiment One investigated the independent and interactive effects of camera interaxial separation and lens magnification on depth interval scaling. Experiment Two investigated the effects of camera convergence angle on depth interval scaling. Experiments Three and Four partially replicated the video system parameters used in Experiment One under more complex scene conditions. For all experiments, ocular fatigue induced by various combinations of video system parameters was also measured. Four trained observers participated in Experiments One and Two. An additional observer participated in Experiments Three and Four. The apparatus used to produce depth intervals in the televised scene was a Howard-Dolman two-rod device. Rods were set to a pre-selected depth interval and observers were required to verbally report perceived depth interval and match the depth interval haptically {{by means of a}} sliding peg device. Stereoscopic TV imagery was provided by means of a beamsplitter camera station and a polarizer display station. All experiments included monoscopic (2 -D) and direct view control conditions. Ocular fatigue tests which were administered included a questionnaire, flicker fusion threshold adjustments, and a near-far test of oculomotor adjustment time. Multifactorial repeated-measures analyses of covariance were performed on data derived from all experiments with a. 05 level set for statistical significance. For Experiments One, Two, and Three stereoscopic imagery produced depth interval estimates which were superior to those found under monoscopic viewing conditions. In addition, increasing camera separation and thereby increasing disparities beyond "natural stereo" values produced improvements in depth interval estimation. Camera convergence exerted a significant effect on performance with camera convergence in front of objects to be compared in depth providing highest accuracy. Lens magnification, which affected retinal disparities, was not found to exert a significant influence on depth interval estimation. For all experiments, no evidence of ocular fatigue was found under any conditions tested. Results are discussed in light of previous studies of depth resolution with stereo TV displays, geometrical models of retinal disparities, and models to account for the discrepancies in depth perception observed between stereo TV and direct viewing conditions...|$|R
