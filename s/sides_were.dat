5|$|In Constantinople, drums with {{twelve or}} {{fourteen}} <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> popular {{beginning in the}} 11th century. The 11th century rock-cut churches of Cappadocia, such as Karanlik Kilise and Elmali Kilise in Göreme, have shallow domes without drums due to the dim natural lighting of cave interiors.|$|E

5|$|Nationalist {{movements}} {{in some countries}} and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia and Indochina were often allied with communist groups, or perceived in the West to be allied with communists. In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s; additionally, the Soviets saw continuing losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology. Both <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> selling armaments to gain influence.|$|E

5|$|Song sources likely {{inflated}} {{the number}} of Jin soldiers and casualties at Caishi, but the 18,000 figure for the Song army is plausible. Modern {{studies suggest that the}} battle was smaller and that both <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> more evenly matched than traditional accounts suggest. Nonetheless, the victory boosted the morale of the Song infantry and halted the southern advance of the Jin army.|$|E
5|$|The Ibratnama {{estimates}} that 12,000 horsemen of Azam Shah lay {{dead on the}} battlefield. It further {{estimates that}} at least 10,000 infantry soldiers from both <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> dead. Khan Zaman and Khan Alam Dakhini's bodies were sent to Gwalior for burial. Ram Singh Hada and Rao Dalpat Bundela's bodies were sent to Nurabad for cremation. Azam Shah and his three dead sons were buried at Humayun's Tomb in Delhi.|$|E
5|$|The Persian fleet {{was still}} {{large enough to}} both bottle up the Allied navy in the straits of Salamis, and send ships to land troops in the Peloponnese. However, in the final reckoning, both <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> {{prepared}} to stake everything on a naval battle, {{in the hope of}} decisively altering the course of the war.|$|E

5|$|The match {{attracted}} considerable media {{interest because}} of the number of foreigners involved. It marked the first time that the two managers of opposing <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> born outside the British Isles, and it was anticipated the final would receive a large overseas audience {{because of the}} inclusion of several international players. Broadcast in 70 countries, viewing figures for the match totalled close to 600million.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} towards {{more effective}} cannons {{was to build}} thicker walls and to prefer round towers, as the curving <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> more likely to deflect a shot than a flat surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures {{had to find a}} way to cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled behind a castle's curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{original}} armament {{consisted of}} a single Bofors 40 mm D70 gun mounted on the ship's bow, a quadruple Strela 2 launcher behind the bridge and a quad 20mm M-75 gun on the stern. Eight MDB-MT3 depth charges could be carried for anti-submarine warfare duties. Located on the <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> two double-barrel 128mm illumination launchers. Sensors included a Racal Decca RM 1216 A surface search radar and a Simrad SQ 3D/SF sonar.|$|E

5|$|The {{tactical}} {{approaches of}} the two <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> cancelling each other out. Real's slow pace interspersed with high speed bursts, while Liverpool preferred a more deliberate approach, keeping possession and making use of their wingers. Their various forms of marking also negated each other, Real man marked Liverpool's best players such as Dalglish and Souness, while Liverpool were content for the nearest defender to mark {{the man on the}} ball.|$|E
5|$|While {{there were}} many {{violations}} of the ceasefire, the incidents were relatively minor. The two governments immediately started complex diplomatic manoeuvres to bring world opinion on their side in case, as was widely expected, the conflict was resumed. However, the two <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> also careful to leave {{the door open for}} a peaceful solution. The latter course was promoted by France and most African states, while the Reagan Administration saw a resumption of the conflict as the best chance to unseat Gaddafi.|$|E
5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals. It is made of {{embroidered}} handwoven black silk with a separate heavy red silk fringe. A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she covered her face the embroidered end would show. Another item in the collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> wrapped around the woman's braids to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E

5|$|Although the two <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> {{about even}} in number, Brant {{had won a}} {{lopsided}} victory. All of the Americans were killed or captured; none of Brant's men were injured. According to a detailed list prepared by Brant and sent to Detroit, 37 Americans were killed and 64 were captured. Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering. This included Lochry, who {{was sitting on a}} log after the battle when a Shawnee warrior killed him with a tomahawk blow to the head. According to some accounts, Brant prevented the Indians from killing even more of the prisoners. The dead were scalped and left unburied.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the proximity of the enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
5|$|As combat {{operations}} quickly revealed, the two <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> badly mismatched. FANK, whose ranks had been increased {{by thousands of}} young urban Cambodians who had flocked to join it {{in the months following}} the removal of Sihanouk, had expanded well beyond its capacity to absorb the new men. Later, given the press of tactical operations and the need to replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.|$|E

5|$|By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves {{disappeared}} and <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> cut away and tightened. With {{the development of}} new clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, through the 1930s swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning. Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure. Coco Chanel made suntans fashionable, and in 1932 French designer Madeleine Vionnet offered an exposed midriff in an evening gown. They were seen a year later in Gold Diggers of 1933. The Busby Berkeley film Footlight Parade of 1932 showcases aquachoreography that featured bikinis. Dorothy Lamour's The Hurricane (1937) also showed two-piece bathing suits.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} geography, the Royal Navy {{could keep the}} German High Seas Fleet {{confined}} to the North Sea with relative ease, {{but was unable to}} break the German superiority in the Baltic Sea. Both <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> aware, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, that a full fleet engagement would likely result in a British victory. The German strategy was, therefore, to try to provoke an engagement on favourable terms: either inducing a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coast, where friendly minefields, torpedo boats, and submarines could even the odds.|$|E
5|$|For {{ten minutes}} after the {{explosion}} there was no firing; sailors from both <b>sides</b> <b>were</b> either too shocked by the blast or desperately extinguishing fires aboard their own ships to continue the fight. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of Orient. At 22:10, Franklin restarted the engagement by firing on Swiftsure. Isolated and battered, Blanquet's ship was soon dismasted and the admiral, suffering a severe head wound, was forced to surrender by the combined firepower of Swiftsure and Defence. More than half of Franklins crew had been killed or wounded.|$|E
