5000|$|In the Western {{world there}} are two basic types of <b>saddles</b> used today for horseback riding, usually called the English <b>saddle</b> and the [...] "Stock" [...] <b>Saddle.</b> The best known stock <b>saddle</b> is the American western <b>saddle,</b> {{followed}} by the Australian Stock <b>Saddle.</b> In Asia and throughout the world, there are numerous <b>saddles</b> of unique designs used by various nationalities and ethnic groups.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} factors to {{consider}} when fitting a <b>saddle,</b> and a professional <b>saddle</b> maker may be consulted to fit a <b>saddle</b> properly to a horse's back. Incorrectly fitting <b>saddles</b> cause pressure points, which may result in bruising, soreness, and behavior problems under <b>saddle.</b> The <b>saddle</b> must also fit the rider, as security on the horse can be compromised when a <b>saddle</b> is the wrong size.|$|R
5|$|In critic Gary Giddins' view,Kelly {{was never}} able to exploit his gifts when he went out on his own. His quartet with Wes Montgomery should have {{developed}} into a major force, but the same commercial interests that shanghaied Montgomery <b>saddled</b> Kelly with the fashionable soul-funk of the mid-'60s. Unlike Montgomery, his career went nowhere, and he didn't live long enough to find himself again.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty's {{decision}} <b>saddled</b> the Royal Navy {{with a pair}} {{of ships}} that could not operate with the Warriors in a tactical squadron and were inferior to the French ironclads then under construction. The naval architect Sir Nathaniel Barnaby, a future Constructor of the Navy, considered that a Defence-class ship was worth one quarter of a Warrior in terms of combat, although they cost about two-thirds as much.|$|E
5|$|The common {{soldiers}} fought bravely at first, {{but they}} were <b>saddled</b> with low pay (with which they had to purchase their own food and medical care), ammunition shortages, and mixed equipment. Due to the pay system, there were no allotments for their families, who were, therefore, forced to follow their husbands/sons into the battle zones. These problems (exacerbated by continuously declining morale) only increased over time.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to map and {{describe}} the development of <b>saddles</b> in Europe, Asia and America, through history with special focus on advancement of equitation and its influence on construction of <b>saddles.</b> First chapter focuses on historical progress of <b>saddles</b> from first archeological findings to current forms. It describes <b>saddles</b> of various types such as medieval knight <b>saddle,</b> sidesaddle and alta escuela <b>saddle.</b> This chapter brought very good comparison of <b>saddles</b> from different continents and reveals many similarities between <b>saddles</b> originated in very distant localities. Also interesting is advancement from simple traveling <b>saddles</b> to heavy and tight military ones and back to simpler types caused by change of riding style. Second chapter focuses on {{both positive and negative}} impact of <b>saddle</b> construction to the horse. First part briefly summarises anatomy of horses, describes influence of different <b>saddle</b> types on horse back, including riding without <b>saddle.</b> It also includes description of choosing proper <b>saddle</b> type and impact of the wrong one. This part concludes with an assesment of under <b>saddle</b> padding. Second part describes effect on rider. Second chapter contsins a great number of current studies following up pressure points under the <b>saddle,</b> while most of those uses pressure sensors in padding under <b>saddle.</b> Third chapter analyzes construction of <b>saddles,</b> with particular focus on modern synthetic materials and revolutionary methods of fabrication. Including several inventions already patented but not yet mass produced. In final chapter well-known mass producers of <b>saddles</b> are presented (including their range of products) as well as newly founded Barefoot <b>Saddles</b> co. specialized in treeless <b>saddles...</b>|$|R
50|$|The terms <b>saddle</b> blanket, <b>saddle</b> pad (or numnah), and <b>saddle</b> cloth {{refer to}} blankets, pads or fabrics {{inserted}} under a <b>saddle.</b> These are usually used to absorb sweat, cushion the <b>saddle,</b> {{and protect the}} horse's back. There are lighter types of <b>saddle</b> cloth, such as the shabrack, used primarily for decorative purposes, often placed {{over the top of}} a more utilitarian pad.|$|R

5|$|The post-millennium {{period has}} seen {{changes to the}} way the club is run as a {{business}}. When a new business management team was appointed {{at the start of the}} 2009–10 season, it inherited a business <b>saddled</b> with debt. The subsequent turnaround has resulted in operational profitability based on the disposal of non-core property assets, a new equity investment and a financial restructuring agreement with lenders for all debt to be repaid within five years. In 2016, the club reported that it was debt-free.|$|E
5|$|Forward riding, {{also called}} Straight riding or the Remontenschule - This {{is the name}} given to the skills taught {{in the first year}} of training, where a young horse learns to be <b>saddled</b> and bridled, learns basic {{commands}} on a longe line, and then is taught to be ridden, mostly in an arena in simple straight lines and turns, to teach correct responses to the rider's legs and hands while mounted. The main goal during this time is to develop free forward movement in as natural a position as possible.|$|E
5|$|Morehead was {{nominated}} for lieutenant governor at his party's nominating convention in Baltimore, Maryland in 1831, and was elected on a split ticket with Democratic governor John Breathitt. He ascended to the governorship upon Breathitt's death in 1834. <b>Saddled</b> with a shortened term, Morehead {{was not able to}} formulate a significant legislative agenda, and stuck to the politically safe issue of internal improvements during his term. When his party changed its name to the Whig Party and wrested control of the General Assembly from the Democrats in the summer of 1834, Morehead hosted the new party's first nominating convention in Frankfort.|$|E

50|$|The term English <b>saddle</b> {{encompasses}} several types, {{including those}} used for show jumping and hunt seat, dressage, <b>Saddle</b> seat, horse racing and polo. To non-horsemen, the major distinguishing feature of an English <b>saddle</b> is {{its lack of}} a horn. However, some Western <b>saddles,</b> such as those used to ride rough stock in rodeos and certain types of western-influenced <b>saddles</b> used in endurance riding, lack a horn as well. These <b>saddles</b> can still be classified as western-influenced, however, due to the deep seat, high cantle, prominent pommels, wide fenders (stirrup leathers) and large, leather-covered stirrups. In addition, <b>saddles</b> used for working cattle in nations other than the United States, such as the Australian Stock <b>Saddle</b> and the Charro <b>Saddles</b> of South America, often share stock <b>saddle</b> features such as a deep seat and extra leather to protect horse and rider, but lack a horn.|$|R
2500|$|An English-style <b>saddle</b> is {{required}} for riding dressage, specifically a [...] "dressage saddle" [...] which is modeled exclusively for the discipline. It is designed with a long and straight <b>saddle</b> flap, mirroring the leg of the dressage rider, which is long with a slight bend in the knee, a deep seat and usually a pronounced knee block. Dressage <b>saddles</b> have longer billets and use shorter girth than other types of English <b>saddles</b> to minimize the straps and buckles underneath the rider's legs. The <b>saddle</b> is usually placed over a square, white <b>saddle</b> pad. Colored trim on the white <b>saddle</b> pad is permitted. A dressage <b>saddle</b> {{is required}} in FEI classes, although any simple English-type <b>saddle</b> may be used at the lower levels.|$|R

While at the university, Sánchez threw four no-hitters and set school records for most strikeouts {{in a single}} game (sixteen), most strikeouts in a single season (105), most strikeouts in a career (311), and most shutouts in a career (ten). However, his final collegiate appearance was arguably his worst, as he was <b>saddled</b> with the loss in the Panthers' NAIA regional playoff defeat to Saint Vincent College, going five innings and allowing six runs on six hits.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the National Football League in 1920 featured early franchises haphazardly formed and often <b>saddled</b> with financial difficulties, poor player talent and attendance rates. As the league expanded through the years, players were provided with no formal representation and received few, if any, benefits. In 1943, Roy Zimmerman's refusal to play an exhibition game without compensation resulted in his trade from the Washington Redskins to the Philadelphia Eagles. With {{the formation of the}} competing All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1946, NFL owners instituted a rule which banned a player for five years from NFL-associated employment if he left the league to join the AAFC.|$|E

He does not let this setback deter him and puts the opportunity to good use by beginning many reforms, and enacting several measures to uplift the poor. These steps are supported by the people while causing a political upheaval among the elite. However, he is troubled {{by the fact that he}} is deceiving Manohari who believes him to be Marthandan. Unable to keep it a secret from her, he tells her the truth. Perceiving his noble character, Manohari accepts him as her brother.|$|E

50|$|The <b>saddle</b> is kept {{on with a}} girth {{attached}} to billets under the flaps, similar to those on a dressage <b>saddle.</b> A surcingle passing over {{the seat of the}} <b>saddle</b> is also used to provide additional safety. The rear of the <b>saddle</b> is sometimes secured by a crupper. A breastcollar is sometimes added. A <b>saddle</b> blanket or numnah is used under the <b>saddle</b> to absorb sweat and to protect the back of the horse.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>saddle</b> {{is usually}} a type of forward seat (jumping <b>saddle),</b> {{generally}} the style called [...] "close contact," [...] though [...] "eventing" [...] and [...] "all-purpose" [...] designs are seen in some areas, particularly at lower levels. <b>Saddles</b> are usually of brown leather, with a plain girth, usually of leather.

5|$|Where ambitious {{construction}} for the 1976 {{games in}} Montreal and 1980 games in Moscow had <b>saddled</b> organisers with expenses greatly {{in excess of}} revenues, Los Angeles strictly controlled expenses by using existing facilities except a swim stadium and a velodrome that were paid for by corporate sponsors. The Olympic Committee led by Peter Ueberroth used some of the profits to endow the LA84 Foundation to promote youth sports in Southern California, educate coaches and maintain a sports library. The 1984 Summer Olympics are often considered the most financially successful modern Olympics.|$|E

5|$|A horse tramway {{was built}} in 1880 by Wigan Corporation and leased to a {{succession}} of private companies to operate services to Pemberton, Aspull and towards Standish. Steam tram operation was introduced quickly, but the network always struggled to pay its way and just {{after the start of}} the 20th century Wigan Corporation gradually bought the operating leases and converted the network to electric tramcar operation. However, the network was <b>saddled</b> with a mix of 'standard' gauge and 'narrow' gauge lines, reducing efficiency and increasing costs, and the last of the Wigan Corporation Tramways were closed in 1931 to be replaced by buses which had begun as 'feeder' services to the trams but which had shown themselves to be faster and more flexible. Trolleybuses were operated on a single route from Wigan to Martland Mill from 1925 to 1931.|$|E
50|$|While small <b>saddles</b> are {{available}} for children's bikes, the primary size parameter for adult <b>saddles</b> is width. Performance <b>saddles,</b> such as for racing, tend to be narrow. Comfort <b>saddles,</b> often found on hybrid bicycles, tend to be wide.|$|R
25|$|English <b>saddles</b> {{are used}} for English riding {{throughout}} the world, not just in England or English-speaking countries.

5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (like many others of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and <b>saddled</b> with major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved {{in the fifteenth century}} and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 U.S. Senate {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy faced his first serious challenger, the young, telegenic, and very well-funded Mitt Romney. Romney ran {{as a successful}} entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues, while Kennedy was <b>saddled</b> not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick and his first wife Joan seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even. Kennedy's campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, {{he was forced to}} take out a second mortgage on his Virginia home. Kennedy responded with a series of attack ads, which focused both on Romney's shifting political views and on the treatment of workers at a paper products plant owned by Romney's Bain Capital. Kennedy's new wife Vicki proved to be a strong asset in campaigning. Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late October debate without a clear winner, but by then Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward. In the November election, despite a very bad outcome for the Democratic Party nationally, Kennedy won re-election by a 58percent to 41percent margin, the closest re-election race of his career.|$|E

5000|$|All English <b>saddles</b> are {{measured}} from the nailhead below the pommel {{to the center}} of the cantle. In the USA, English <b>saddles,</b> other than <b>saddle</b> seat styles, are manufactured in standard sizes for adult riders ranging from 16½ to 18 inches. Standard <b>Saddle</b> Seat sizes range from 19 inches to 21 inches. Most styles also manufacture proportionately smaller <b>saddles</b> for children. However, seat measurement is not a hard and fast way to determine if a <b>saddle</b> will fit a given rider. No two <b>saddles</b> are identical; there can be 1/4" [...] variation between <b>saddles</b> of different brands with the same size designation. Length of thigh often plays a greater role in selecting a proper seat size than does rider weight or hip width. As a rough rule of thumb, sizes 16½ and below (19" [...] for <b>Saddle</b> Seat) are generally for youth riders and smaller women. 17 and 17½ inch <b>saddles</b> are usually suitable for adult women of average size, with the 17 inch seat more suitable for shorter riders and the 17½ for those with a longer thigh (20" [...] and 21" [...] for <b>Saddle</b> Seat). 18 inch <b>saddles</b> are the most common size for adult men and larger women. (21" [...] for <b>Saddle</b> Seat, with larger custom sizes sometimes available). <b>Saddles</b> are also manufactured with different flap lengths to accommodate riders of different sizes.|$|R
50|$|The Western <b>saddle</b> is {{different}} from an English <b>saddle</b> in {{that it has no}} padding between the tree and the external leather and fleece skirting. The weight bearing area of the <b>saddle</b> is large and usually covered with sheepskin, but it must be padded with a <b>saddle</b> blanket in order to provide a comfortable fit for the horse. Western <b>saddles</b> are extensively decorated—the carved leatherwork is often a true work of art—and intricately carved silver conchos and other additions are frequently added to the <b>saddle</b> for show purposes. More than any other style of <b>saddle,</b> the western <b>saddle</b> can be customized to be a true expression of the rider's taste and style. A fine quality western <b>saddle,</b> properly maintained, is intended to last for a person's lifetime, or even beyond.|$|R
