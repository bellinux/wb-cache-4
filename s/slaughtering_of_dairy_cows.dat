40|$|HE daiiy {{price support}} program {{is likely to}} be the focal point of {{agricultural}} policy in 1984. Dramatic increases in the program’s cost have made it a visible target for politicians concerned about federal budget deficits. Consumer groups, who favor lower dairy prices, also are opposed to the current program. Livestock producers, however, opposed recent changes in the dairy program, fearing that such efforts to reduce surplus dairy production will promote a significant <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> that will keep beefprices at low levels. These groups and their opposition to the dairy program were confronted, as usual, by a politically powerful dairy lobby. 1 This article first reviews the history and mechanics <b>of</b> the <b>dairy</b> price support program. Elementary economic principles show why the dairy program has generated an increasing volume <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> surplus by effectively maintaining milk prices above the competitive market level. The program’s guarantee to purchase all surplus product at the support price is shown to produce an inefficient allocation of resources and a transfer <b>of</b> wealth to <b>dairy</b> producers and suppliers of production inputs.

In this thesis were evaluated the results for 294 <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> in 2010. The underlying data were obtained from Dairyplan programm on the farm in Trhový Štěpánov, from economic analysis of ZD Trhový Štěpánov a. s. between 2008 and 2010 and from the annual report for each year. In 2010 there were discarded 294 <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> from total 864 pieces, that means 34 % of total number. Among causes <b>of</b> discarding <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> belong low productivity, other zootechnical reasons, udder desease, fertility disorders, difficult births and other health reasons.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} bachelor´s thesis was {{to capture}} the basic {{behaviour}} categories in <b>dairy</b> cattle breeding <b>cows</b> in production stable {{in relation to their}} reproductive cycle. The research was carried out on four groups: after calving (12 pcs), between 1 st - 3 rd insemination (50 pcs), heavily pregnant (39 pcs) and cows in the dry period (32 pcs). The milk and combined utility type <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> were housed in a large scale stable. Milk yield was monitored as a factor of milk performance traits. Milk yield of Holstein cattle (H) and Czech Fleckvieh cattle (C) were 35. 10 kg and 30. 88 kg (P> 0. 05) during increasing milk flow. In a group <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> in insemination period Holstein and Czech Fleckvieh cows produced 31. 16 kg of milk respectively 25. 15 kg. The differences in milk yield were statistically significant (P 0. 01). In the group of heavily pregnant cows decreased milk yield in both Holstein and Czech Fleckvieh cattle to 18. 18 kg respectively 17. 31 kg of milk (P> 0. 05). The length of insemination interval (from the group of fertility traits) reached 75. 57 days within group <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> H and 67. 82 days within group C. Service period <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> H was 151. 99 days and 152. 25 days within <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> C (P> 0. 05). The length of feed intake was determined while differences in behaviour were being assessed between groups. In the group after calving took the feed intake 25. 7 % days, in the group <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> in insemination period 23. 9 %, by heavily pregnant cows 25. 8 % and by <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> standing in the dry period 29. 6 % of total time. The length of standing achieved by the group after calving was 18. 8 %, by the group <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> in the insemination period 24. 0 %, by heavily pregnant <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> 16. 5 % and by dry cows 15. 7 % of total time. The length of rest was by the group after calving 42. 0 %, by the group <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> in the insemination period 37. 1 %, by heavily pregnant <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> 53. 9 %, and by dry cows 53. 2 % of total time.

The {{aim of the}} research was to obtain the correction factors of non-genetic effects that have influence on {{milk production}} <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> The research used a survey method on milk records <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> kept in <b>Dairy</b> Cattle Breeding Center (BBPTU) of Baturraden. The data taken was only those relevant with the research objective. The data examined were as many as 324 production records <b>of</b> 108 <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> which had completed first three lactation, originated from 36 sires. Non-genetic factors studied were season, lactation period, number of days in milk of a lactation and age at birth. The effects of non-genetic factors were estimated through Stepwise multiple regression method. Effect of the number of days in milk of a lactation was highly significant (P ≤ 0. 01), age at birth was significant (P ≤ 0. 05), and season and the lactation period were not significant (P> 0. 05) on milk production <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> Variables that have effect on milk production were then assigned the correction factors. Correction factors were derived from the least square mean (LSM) of the actual milk production.

The number <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> owned has a large and statistically significant impact on household cash income; each cow owned increased income by at least 53 % of the mean total income <b>of</b> households without <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> <b>Dairy</b> <b>cow</b> ownership also increases consumption <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> products by 1. 0 litre per week, {{even though most of}} the increase in milk production is sold.

The cattle husbandry sector, in recent years, has been facing a worsening of the indicators of reproduction and longevity in <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> It is primarily the requirement of constantly increasing the milk yield <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> that has had an adverse impact on these indicators. The worsening of these indicators {{can result in a}} reduction of the cost-effectiveness of the production of milk and meat. The evaluation of influences on milk production and fertility in a herd of Holstein cattle was carried out at the AGRODAM Hořepník s. r. o. company. The selected influences included milk yield quantity, parity, age at first calving, calving interval, insemination index, and conception rate after first insemination. Two hundred and two Holstein <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> were included in the monitoring. Data on milk yield and reproduction were obtained from milk yield records and zootechnical records. The results showed that milk production of the monitored group <b>of</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> was at a high level (10, 025 kg of milk). The highest milk yield in kilograms of milk during first lactation was achieved by <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> that calved at the age of 27 to 29 months (9, 335 kg of milk). According to the milk yield during the first lactation, the highest milk yield during three lactations was by <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> that had a milk yield exceeding 10, 000 kg of milk during the first lactation (35, 515 kg).
