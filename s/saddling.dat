A statue of Roy Rogers and a Bona Allen saddle-maker <b>saddling</b> Trigger is located in downtown Buford. The Bona Allen Company thrived during the Great Depression in the 1930s, likely {{as a result of}} the Depression forcing farmers to choose horses over expensive tractors, thereby increasing the demand for saddles, collars, bridles, and other leather products.|$|E
5|$|American Pharoah {{made his}} track debut in a maiden race over {{six and a}} half furlongs on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack on August9. Ridden by Martin Garcia, he started as the 7–5 {{favorite}} against eight opponents. He became unsettled before the race and, after running in second place until the stretch, faded to finish fifth behind Om, Iron Fist, One Lucky Dane, and Calculator, more than nine lengths behind the winner. He ran in a blinker hood, which appeared to unnerve him, as did the commotion in the <b>saddling</b> paddock. Baffert addressed his anxiety issues by removing the hood and stuffing cotton in the horse's ears for subsequent races.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Herod sees Cort's busted {{hand and}} gives Ratsy twenty seconds to leave town. He offers to face Cort left-handed, which Herod is equally fast at drawing with. Herod kills Ratsy {{with a rifle}} and then squares off to fight Cort. Herod then {{secretly}} tells his guards to kill Cort if he is the winner. At the moment Herod draws, several buildings explode on the street. Herod's house and the clock tower are also blown up, and through the smoke and flames, Ellen walks back into town, having faked her death {{with the help of}} Cort, Doc Wallace, the Blind Boy, and the Kid's stash of dynamite. Cort tells Herod that from now on all fights in town will be fair, and proceeds to kill Herod's men who were stationed around town. Ellen and Herod face off, and she finally reveals to him who she is when she throws her father's old badge at Herod's feet. They draw on each other; Herod shoots Ellen in the arm and she fires a shot though Herod's chest. Herod raises his gun to fire again but Ellen shoots him in the eye, finishing him for good. She throws her father's badge to Cort and names him as the new Marshal before <b>saddling</b> up and riding out of the town.|$|E

25|$|On April 13, 1994, in {{his second}} start as a Montreal Expo, Martínez lost a perfect game with one out {{in the eighth inning}} when he hit Cincinnati's Reggie Sanders with a pitch. An angered Sanders charged the mound, and threw Martínez to the ground, before both teams cleared the benches and broke up any {{potential}} fight. Sanders was later ridiculed in the press for assuming that a pitcher would abandon a perfect game in order to hit a batter intentionally. Martínez allowed a leadoff single in the ninth inning, breaking up his no-hitter, and was removed for reliever John Wetteland (who loaded the bases, then allowed two sacrifice flies, thus <b>saddling</b> Martínez with a no-decision). Three years later, in 1997, Martínez had a one-hitter against the Reds; the one hit came in the 5th inning.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to map and {{describe}} the development of <b>saddles</b> in Europe, Asia and America, through history with special focus on advancement of equitation and its influence on construction of <b>saddles.</b> First chapter focuses on historical progress of <b>saddles</b> from first archeological findings to current forms. It describes <b>saddles</b> of various types such as medieval knight <b>saddle,</b> sidesaddle and alta escuela <b>saddle.</b> This chapter brought very good comparison of <b>saddles</b> from different continents and reveals many similarities between <b>saddles</b> originated in very distant localities. Also interesting is advancement from simple traveling <b>saddles</b> to heavy and tight military ones and back to simpler types caused by change of riding style. Second chapter focuses on {{both positive and negative}} impact of <b>saddle</b> construction to the horse. First part briefly summarises anatomy of horses, describes influence of different <b>saddle</b> types on horse back, including riding without <b>saddle.</b> It also includes description of choosing proper <b>saddle</b> type and impact of the wrong one. This part concludes with an assesment of under <b>saddle</b> padding. Second part describes effect on rider. Second chapter contsins a great number of current studies following up pressure points under the <b>saddle,</b> while most of those uses pressure sensors in padding under <b>saddle.</b> Third chapter analyzes construction of <b>saddles,</b> with particular focus on modern synthetic materials and revolutionary methods of fabrication. Including several inventions already patented but not yet mass produced. In final chapter well-known mass producers of <b>saddles</b> are presented (including their range of products) as well as newly founded Barefoot <b>Saddles</b> co. specialized in treeless <b>saddles...</b>|$|R
50|$|The terms <b>saddle</b> blanket, <b>saddle</b> pad (or numnah), and <b>saddle</b> cloth {{refer to}} blankets, pads or fabrics {{inserted}} under a <b>saddle.</b> These are usually used to absorb sweat, cushion the <b>saddle,</b> {{and protect the}} horse's back.

500|$|When Gervase Markham {{published}} his Cavalarice, or the English Horseman in 1617, farmers {{were not only}} using pack horses, farm horses and cart horses, but were also breeding horses for <b>saddling</b> and driving. Markham recommended crossing native horses with other breeds for particular purposes, for example suggesting Turks or Irish Hobbies as an outcross to produce riding animals, Friesland and Flanders horses to produce light driving animals, and German heavy draught horses to produce heavy haulage animals. Horse fairs were numerous, {{and some of the}} earliest mentions of specific breeds, such as Cleveland horses and Suffolk Punch horses, date from this time. Large Dutch horses were imported by King William III (1650– 1702) when he discovered that existing cart horses did not have the strength for the task of draining the Fens. These horses became known as Lincolnshire Blacks, and the English heavy draught horses of today are their descendants. By the middle of the 17th century, the reputation of the British horse throughout Europe had become so good that, according to Sir Jonas Moore in 1703, [...] "since the peace treaty with France, farmers had been offered by Frenchmen three times the accustomed price for their horses".|$|E
500|$|Although Grant had {{not created}} Anarky {{to be used}} beyond the two-part debut story, the {{positive}} reception Anarky received among readers and his editor caused Grant to change his mind. In the following years, Grant developed the character to contrast with typical heroic characters. Based on a theme of philosophy, Anarky was not given a tragic past—a common motivator in comic books—but was instead given motivation by his convictions and beliefs. In his introduction to the trade paperback, Grant compared this with Batman, who fought crime due to personal tragedy. Grant also contrasted Anarky with common teenage superheroes. Rejecting the tradition established by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, Grant avoided <b>saddling</b> Anarky with personal problems, a girlfriend, or social life. This was intended to convey the idea that Anarky was self-assured in his goals. The singular problem the character did have was tending to his secret activities while escaping from juvenile detention centers, or hiding his actions from his parents, who did not approve of his activism. These aspects of the character were incorporated into [...] "Anarky: Tomorrow Belongs to Us" [...] and [...] "Anarky", each respectively published in 1995, as this period of the character's portrayal came to a conclusion.|$|E

50|$|The term English <b>saddle</b> {{encompasses}} several types, {{including those}} used for show jumping and hunt seat, dressage, <b>Saddle</b> seat, horse racing and polo. To non-horsemen, the major distinguishing feature of an English <b>saddle</b> is {{its lack of}} a horn. However, some Western <b>saddles,</b> such as those used to ride rough stock in rodeos and certain types of western-influenced <b>saddles</b> used in endurance riding, lack a horn as well. These <b>saddles</b> can still be classified as western-influenced, however, due to the deep seat, high cantle, prominent pommels, wide fenders (stirrup leathers) and large, leather-covered stirrups. In addition, <b>saddles</b> used for working cattle in nations other than the United States, such as the Australian Stock <b>Saddle</b> and the Charro <b>Saddles</b> of South America, often share stock <b>saddle</b> features such as a deep seat and extra leather to protect horse and rider, but lack a horn.|$|R
2500|$|An English-style <b>saddle</b> is {{required}} for riding dressage, specifically a [...] "dressage saddle" [...] which is modeled exclusively for the discipline. It is designed with a long and straight <b>saddle</b> flap, mirroring the leg of the dressage rider, which is long with a slight bend in the knee, a deep seat and usually a pronounced knee block. Dressage <b>saddles</b> have longer billets and use shorter girth than other types of English <b>saddles</b> to minimize the straps and buckles underneath the rider's legs. The <b>saddle</b> is usually placed over a square, white <b>saddle</b> pad. Colored trim on the white <b>saddle</b> pad is permitted. A dressage <b>saddle</b> {{is required}} in FEI classes, although any simple English-type <b>saddle</b> may be used at the lower levels.|$|R
500|$|The colt {{arrived at}} Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, on April 28, 2014. He was {{flown in from}} California, his first time on a plane, and {{traveled}} quietly. Once the plane landed, however, his travel idiosyncrasy was discovered by the waiting press when he refused to be unloaded until he was turned around and backed down the ramp; Alan Sherman explained later that this was also his typical manner of egress from ground-based transportation. [...] Upon arrival at Churchill Downs, the horses entered in the Kentucky Derby each were given a special saddle cloth to wear while exercising on the track, identifying them as Derby contenders and including their name. [...] The one given to California Chrome contained a typographical error, with California misspelled as [...] "Califorina". He wore it the first day and then the track management obtained one with the correct spelling. Critics commented that bringing the horse in late and not giving him a full workout on the track was a mistake, but Sherman's strategy was backed by Lukas. [...] In {{the days leading up}} to the race, California Chrome galloped on the track, was walked in the <b>saddling</b> paddock, and schooled at the starting gate. Willie Delgado later remarked that the horse did not particularly like that particular track, saying [...] "he never actually felt comfortable on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Grant laconically {{described}} Lonnie Machin as [...] "a serious-beyond-his-years {{teenager who}} wants to set the world to rights." [...] As the character {{was based on a}} theme of ideas, he had initially been given no personal, tragic past; a common motivator in superhero fiction. This was intended to contrast with Batman, who fought crime due to personal tragedy, while Anarky would do so in the name of ideals and beliefs. As the character was further developed, he was also intended to contrast with common teenage superheroes. Referring to the tradition established by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby of <b>saddling</b> teenagers with personal problems, Grant purposely gave Anarky none, nor did he develop a girlfriend or social life for the character. As Grant wrote for the Batman: Anarky introduction, this was intended to convey the idea that Anarky was single minded in his goals. In one of the earliest explorations of Lonnie Machin's back story in [...] "The Anarky Ultimatum", Grant described Lonnie as a prolific reader, but also of being isolated from peers his own age during his childhood. This was elaborated upon years later in the [...] "Anarky" [...] storyline, which described Lonnie as having lost a childhood friend living in an impoverished nation, the latter suffering the loss of his family due to civil war and strife before disappearing entirely. The resulting shock of discovering {{at such a young age}} that the world was in turmoil precipitated Lonnie Machin's rapid maturation and eventual radicalization.|$|E
500|$|As a foal, he was nicknamed [...] "Junior" [...] {{because of}} his {{resemblance}} to his sire, Lucky Pulpit. [...] Lucky Pulpit had won three races, placed in several graded stakes races, and hit the board in 13 of his 22 starts. However, a viral respiratory infection damaged his breathing and limited him to racing over short distances. California Chrome's dam is Love the Chase, and he was her first foal. She was purchased for $30,000 as a two-year-old by an agent for a horse ownership group called the Blinkers On Racing Stable. As a two- and three-year-old filly, she was anxious in the <b>saddling</b> paddock, and as a result, often lost races before she ever got to the starting gate. She ran six times and won on her fourth try in a February 2009 maiden claiming race at Golden Gate Fields. After her win, Steve Coburn and Perry Martin became her owners, ran her two more times, then retired her later that year. They hoped she would become a good broodmare, as she had a promising pedigree. When she retired, {{it was discovered that}} she had raced with a breathing problem—an entrapped epiglottis that restricted her air intake, but which could be corrected with surgery. [...] , she had given birth to four foals, the two fillies and a colt, all full siblings to California Chrome. After California Chrome became a Kentucky Derby contender, Martin and Coburn turned down an offer of $2.1million for Love the Chase, and ultimately sold her in November 2016 for $1.95 million.|$|E

5000|$|All English <b>saddles</b> are {{measured}} from the nailhead below the pommel {{to the center}} of the cantle. In the USA, English <b>saddles,</b> other than <b>saddle</b> seat styles, are manufactured in standard sizes for adult riders ranging from 16½ to 18 inches. Standard <b>Saddle</b> Seat sizes range from 19 inches to 21 inches. Most styles also manufacture proportionately smaller <b>saddles</b> for children.
