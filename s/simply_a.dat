5|$|In 2006, Vargas Llosa wrote The Bad Girl (Travesuras de la niña mala), which {{journalist}} Kathryn Harrison argues is a rewrite (rather than <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> recycling) of Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1856).

5|$|A nonempty subset W of a {{vector space}} V that is closed under {{addition}} and scalar multiplication (and therefore contains the 0-vector of V) {{is called a}} linear subspace of V, or <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> subspace of V, when the ambient space is unambiguously a vector space. Subspaces of V are vector spaces (over the same field) in their own right. The intersection of all subspaces containing a given set S of vectors is called its span, {{and it is the}} smallest subspace of V containing the set S. Expressed in terms of elements, the span is the subspace consisting of all the linear combinations of elements of S.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on July 1. It steadily organized as it moved westward, and resembled a tropical depression by July 7. However, surface reports and reconnaissance aircraft indicated the system did not have tropical characteristics, and remained <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> low-pressure system. The wave produced tropical storm-force winds as it moved through the Lesser Antilles on July 8, but did not acquire tropical characteristics until it reached the eastern Caribbean. Because it had tropical storm-force winds, the system was upgraded immediately to Tropical Storm Claudette after it developed a low-level circulation later on July 8.|$|E

5|$|Betty {{has gained}} weight {{over the past}} few months, causing her self-worth to drop and her sex life with Henry to flatline. This prompts an {{intervention}} of sorts from Henry's mother, Pauline, who suggests diet pills. When Betty goes to the doctor's office in an attempt to obtain diet pills, the doctor refuses. After a routine examination, he finds a possibly cancerous lump in Betty's throat. Betty returns home in a hysteric fever. She calls Don, who reassures her. Betty begins to confront the legacy of her life and the effect her death would have on her loved ones. Several days later, the doctor calls back to tell her the tumor is benign. Henry holds a despondent Betty in his arms. She ponders her life as <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> sad, fat housewife.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the line was {{finished}} there were public calls from {{inside and outside the}} company for Helm to resign, mostly because of his support for a proposed Memphis branch of the railroad. To complete the branch, the Louisville and Nashville would have to complete a line from Bowling Green to Guthrie, Kentucky. There it would join a line owned by the Memphis and Ohio Railroad that began across the state line at Clarksville, Tennessee and extended to Memphis. Supporters believed the branch would economically help both Louisville and Memphis and would lessen their dependence on trade along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. Opponents argued that the project was <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> ploy to whip up new support for the struggling railroad. Helm endorsed the Memphis branch in his annual report in 1857.|$|E
