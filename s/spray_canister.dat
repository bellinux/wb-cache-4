50|$|Every marking kit and <b>spray</b> <b>canister</b> has {{a unique}} {{forensic}} DNA signature which {{is a series of}} combinations of A (Adenine), C (Cytosine), G (Guanine) and T (Thymine). The synthetic DNA used is short-chain, making it far more robust than human DNA.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s, No Name diverged {{from its}} {{original}} plain packaging as red lettering and various product illustrations were added. Meanwhile, a 1987 segment of the CTV Television Network show Live It Up! took {{the position that the}} line’s product packaging wasn't doing enough to adequately distinguish relatively harmless cooking sprays from more dangerous cleaning products. During that same program, a Loblaw executive presented the company’s solution - a No Name <b>spray</b> <b>canister</b> with a red cap to indicate potentially harmful contents.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to issued pistols, less-lethal weapons such as tasers and large pepper <b>spray</b> <b>canisters</b> are carried {{also by the}} ERU.|$|R
25|$|Expandable batons {{are used}} by some units such as Security Command and the Sabre Red pepper <b>spray</b> <b>canisters</b> are {{exclusively}} equipped to the officers of Police Coast Guard and Police Tactical Unit. A pair of handcuffs is issued to the officers as restrains.|$|R
5000|$|Because <b>spray</b> <b>canisters</b> are {{pressurized}} {{and contain}} hazardous contents, {{they must be}} stored in cool temperatures and handled with care. They can explode from overheating if left on a car dashboard. [...] A typical can of bear spray costs about $40 to $50 USD. Bear spray is available to rent in some tourist destinations, such as Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National Park.|$|R
50|$|Police {{officers}} {{may often}} {{choose to use}} such flashlights because they are viewed primarily as illumination devices; thus, if a police officer carries one in his hands during nighttime encounters with potentially violent subjects, it {{would be less likely}} to escalate the situation (by making the subject feel threatened) than if the officer were to be equipped with a baton or pepper <b>spray</b> <b>canister</b> instead. This permits the officer to appear less threatening while having an impact weapon in hand and ready for instantaneous action, should the situation indeed turn violent.|$|E
50|$|James was a {{passenger}} stopped by Portland police officers Rick Bean, Kenneth Reynolds, and Scott McCollister. The driver, Terry Jackson, {{was arrested and}} placed in a squad car after he was discovered to have an outstanding warrant. After he and another passenger in the car were removed peaceably by the officers, James jumped from the back seat into the driver's seat. McCollister then made several unsuccessful attempts to remove James while partially within the vehicle through an open door. He claimed to have tried to pull James out by her hair, and also attempted to use a Taser. He said that he had also attempted to use pepper spray to subdue James, but was unable to operate the canister; an investigation by the Portland Police Bureau found McCollister's pepper <b>spray</b> <b>canister</b> was operational, but no traces of spray were found. McCollister drew his firearm and held it to James' head, demanding she exit the vehicle. McCollister said he then felt the car move and, concerned that he could have fallen out and been run over, fired a single shot.|$|E
50|$|The {{everyday}} working uniform {{consists of}} combat trousers in a dark-blue fabric with a dark-blue polo shirt or a long sleeve button shirt and black boots. The long sleeved shirt is worn without tie, with the {{sleeves rolled up}} in warm weather. The trousers {{are based on a}} model that was first introduced in 1992, which in turn was inspired by the Swedish Armed Forces' M90 field uniform. Included in the uniform is a police duty belt consisting of a handgun holster, a helmet fastener, and several pouches for the handcuffs, spare magazines, the pepper <b>spray</b> <b>canister</b> and baton. The headgear is usually a dark-blue side cap, known as båtmössa ("boat cap"), embellished with yellow-gold piping and a metal cap badge. There are a number of jackets designed for different tasks and weather situations, most of them in dark-blue. According to the regulations, officers should typically wear hi-visibility vests, unless it is detrimental to the task at hand. Officers may also wear a light-blue long sleeve dress shirt with a dark-blue tie, usually paired with a dark-blue or white peaked cap, and sometimes worn with dark-blue suit jackets and trousers. There is also a light-blue short sleeve dress shirt that may be worn open-necked. White dress shirts are primarily reserved for more formal occasions.|$|E
50|$|As {{less than}} lethal options, the Border Patrol uses the FN 303 Launcher. The FN 303 fires plastic pellet balls {{containing}} OC (Oleoresin Capsicum) Pepper dust. The plastic pellet balls burst on impact spraying the suspect with OC Pepper dust and also {{act as an}} impact projectile. The Border Patrol also issues its agents OC Pepper <b>spray</b> <b>canisters,</b> tasers and a collapsible/telescopic (or telescoping) steel police baton.|$|R
25|$|To breach doors quickly, {{battering}} rams, shotguns with breaching rounds, or explosive charges {{can be used}} {{to break}} the lock or hinges, or even demolish the door frame itself. SWAT teams also use many non-lethal munitions and weapons. These include Tasers, pepper <b>spray</b> <b>canisters,</b> shotguns loaded with bean bag rounds, Pepperball guns, stinger grenades, flash bang grenades, and tear gas. Ballistic shields are used in close quarters situations to provide cover for SWAT team members and reflect gunfire. Pepperball guns are essentially paint ball markers loaded with balls containing Oleoresin Capsicum ("pepper spray").|$|R
2500|$|The United States {{offensive}} {{biological weapons}} program was instigated by President Franklin Roosevelt and the U.S. Secretary of War in October 1941. Research occurred at several sites. A production facility was built at Terre Haute, Indiana but testing with a benign agent demonstrated {{contamination of the}} facility so no production occurred during World War II. A more advanced production facility was constructed in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, which began producing biological agents in 1954. Fort Detrick, Maryland later became a production facility {{as well as a}} research site. The U.S. developed anti-personnel and anti-crop biological weapons. Several deployment systems were developed including aerial spray tanks, aerosol <b>spray</b> <b>canisters,</b> grenades, rocket warheads and cluster bombs.

40|$|How can {{inhalant}} abuse be recognized? See page 4. {{from the}} director: Although many parents are appropriately concerned about illicit {{drugs such as}} marijuana, cocaine, and LSD, they often ignore the dangers posed to their children from common household products that contain volatile solvents or aerosols. Products such as glues, nail polish remover, lighter fluid, spray paints, deodorant and hair <b>sprays,</b> whipped cream <b>canisters,</b> and cleaning fluids are widely available yet far from innocuous. Many young people inhale the vapors from these sources in search of quick intoxication without being aware that using inhalants, even once, can have serious health consequences. National surveys indicate that nearly 22. 3 million Americans have used inhalants {{at least once in}} their lives. NIDA’s Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey reveals that 14. 9 percent of 8 th-graders have used inhalants. Parents and children need to know that even sporadic or single episodes of inhalant abuse can be extremely dangerous. Inhalants can disrupt heart rhythms and cause death from cardiac arrest, or lower oxygen levels enough to cause suffocation. Regular abuse of these substances can result in serious harm to vital organs, including the brain, heart, kidneys, and liver. Through scientific research, we have learned much about {{the nature and extent of}} inhalant abuse, its pharmacology, and its consequences. This research has brought the picture of inhalant abuse in the Nation into focus and pointed to the dangers and the warning signs for parents, educators, and clinicians. We hope this compilation of the latest scientific information will help alert readers to inhalant abuse and its harmful effects and aid efforts to deal with this problem effectively...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: During an entomological {{survey in}} {{preparation}} for malaria control interventions in Mwea division, the number of malaria cases at the Kimbimbi sub-district hospital was in a steady decline. The underlying factors for this reduction were unknown {{and needed to be}} identified before any malaria intervention tools were deployed in the area. We therefore set out to investigate the potential factors that could have contributed to the decline of malaria cases in the hospital by analyzing the malaria control knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) that the residents in Mwea applied in an integrated fashion, also known as integrated malaria management (IMM). METHODS: Integrated Malaria Management was assessed among community members of Mwea division, central Kenya using KAP survey. The KAP study evaluated community members' malaria disease management practices at the home and hospitals, personal protection measures used at the household level and malaria transmission prevention methods relating to vector control. Concurrently, we also passively examined the prevalence of malaria parasite infection via outpatient admission records at the major referral hospital in the area. In addition we studied the mosquito vector population dynamics, the malaria sporozoite infection status and entomological inoculation rates (EIR) over an 8 month period in 6 villages to determine the risk of malaria transmission in the entire division. RESULTS: A total of 389 households in Mwea division were interviewed in the KAP study while 90 houses were surveyed in the entomological study. Ninety eight percent of the households knew about malaria disease while approximately 70 % of households knew its symptoms and methods to manage it. Ninety seven percent of the interviewed households went to a health center for malaria diagnosis and treatment. Similarly a higher proportion (81 %) used anti-malarial medicines bought from local pharmacies. Almost 90 % of households reported owning and using an insecticide treated bed net and 81 % reported buying the nets within the last 5 years. The community also used mosquito reduction measures including, in order of preference, environmental management (35 %), mosquito repellent and smoke (31 %) insecticide <b>canister</b> <b>sprays</b> (11 %), and window and door screens (6 %). These methods used by the community comprise an integrated malaria management (IMM) package. Over the last 4 years prior to this study, the malaria cases in the community hospital reduced from about 40 % in 2000 to less than 10 % by 2004 and by the year 2007 malaria cases decreased to zero. In addition, a one time cross-sectional malaria parasite survey detected no Plasmodium infection in 300 primary school children in the area. Mosquito vector populations were variable in the six villages but were generally lower in villages that did not engage in irrigation activities. The malaria risk as estimated by EIR remained low and varied by village and proximity to irrigation areas. The average EIR in the area was estimated at 0. 011 infectious bites per person per day. CONCLUSIONS: The usage of a combination of malaria control tools in an integrated fashion by residents of Mwea division might have influenced the decreased malaria cases in the district hospital and in the school children. A vigorous campaign emphasizing IMM should be adopted and expanded in Mwea division and in other areas with different eco-epidemiological patterns of malaria transmission. With sustained implementation and support from community members integrated malaria management can reduce malaria significantly in affected communities in Africa...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the final}} bank robbery attempt, the threesome, emboldened by the reward on Scurlock, planned on robbing five banks {{on the same}} night. According to Steve Meyers, they even had a [...] "mobile base station set up to white out the police frequencies." [...] But after {{learning}} {{that the police had}} convinced every bank in Seattle to put electronic tracers in with any stolen money, they scaled back the plans and decided to rob just one bank. On a rainy dark Thanksgiving eve, 1996, at around 5:30 pm they hit the Seafirst Bank, which they learned was going to have $3-$4 million on hand that day. They escaped in one car and changed to a white van to throw off police. They then started digging frantically through the money looking for the electronic tracers. At the same time they became stuck in Thanksgiving holiday rush hour traffic. At that point, police say that they spotted a van in which there was a flashlight going back and forth. The police, in a number of vehicles, then surrounded the van, which had turned onto a side street and stopped. Police claimed that Steve Meyers got out of the van with a rifle and began shooting at them but Steve Meyers said that he never got out of the van and that police fired on them first. Meyers says that he and Biggins were shot in the arms as a result and were immobilized. Scurlock, who was driving, was the one who got out of the van, intending to fire in self-defense but his rifle jammed. He then got back in the van and took off. A severely injured Biggins returned 37 rounds at the police. Two hundred police officers eventually responded to the scene. Scurlock jumped out of the van and fired three rounds from a shotgun at police. The van then took off again but crashed into the side of a house. Biggins and Meyers were found in the van with more than $1 million spread out over the floor of the van in addition to weapons, makeup, clothing and blood. But Scurlock wasn't there. He had escaped the scene without being noticed by police when he jumped out before the van took off for the last time. Police searched the area thoroughly but were unable to find Scurlock. The next day, Thanksgiving, Wilma Walker and her family were getting ready for Thanksgiving dinner. Just for peace of mind, her son Ronald decided to check their camper {{in the back of their}} house. A few minutes later, Ronald came into the house saying, [...] "I saw him, I saw him! He has black curly hair!" [...] according to Wilma. They then called the police. Three officers showed up. One knocked on the door of the camper and identified themselves. There was no response. The police <b>sprayed</b> two full <b>canisters</b> of pepper <b>spray</b> into the camper. They still heard nothing. Police were convinced that no one was in the camper but to satisfy the Walker family, Sgt. Howard Monta went over to take one more look. He had begun to look into the camper with his flashlight when a gunshot went off. Monta thought he had been shot. The other two officers opened fire on the camper. More officers responded. Approximately four hours passed with nothing happening and then police fired tear gas into the camper before making an entry. Police entered the camper and found Scurlock dead from a self-inflicted gun wound. The gunshot that Sgt. Monta had heard was actually Scurlock shooting himself. [...] The number of robberies, 18 in total, and the amounts stolen, almost $2.3 million, make Scurlock one of the most prolific bank robbers in the history of the United States. His accomplices, Steven Paul Meyers and Mark John Biggins, were each sentenced to 21 years' imprisonment.|$|R
