50|$|It {{takes about}} a week to build the tatara and {{complete}} the iron conversion to steel. When the process is done, the clay tub is broken and the <b>steel</b> <b>bloom,</b> known as a kera, is removed. At {{the end of the}} process, the tatara will have consumed about 10 tons of satetsu and 12 tons of charcoal, leaving about 2.5 tons of tamahagane.|$|E
50|$|The <b>steel</b> <b>bloom,</b> or kera, that is {{produced}} in the tatara contains steel that varies greatly in carbon content, ranging from wrought iron to pig iron. Three types of steel are chosen for the blade; a very low carbon steel called hocho-tetsu {{is used for the}} core of the blade (shingane). The high carbon steel (tamahagane), and the remelted pig iron (cast iron or nabe-gane), are combined to form the outer skin of the blade (kawagane). Only about 1/3 of the kera produces steel that is suitable for sword production.|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} ISO 1. 2738 medium-carbon {{low-alloy steel}} {{has long been}} used to fabricate plastic molds for injection molding of large automotive components, such as bumpers and dashboards. These molds are usually machined from large pre-hardened <b>steel</b> <b>blooms.</b> Due to the bloom size, the heat treatment yields mixed microstructures, continuously varying from surface to core. Negative events (such as microcracks due to improper weld bed deposition or incomplete extraction of already formed plastic objects) or too large thermal/mechanical stresses can conceivably cause mold failure during service due to the low fracture toughness and fatigue resistance typically encountered in large slack quenched and tempered ISO 1. 2738 <b>steel</b> <b>blooms.</b> Alternative <b>steel</b> grades, including both non-standard microalloyed steels, designed for the same production process, and precipitation hardening steels, have recently been proposed by steelworks. However, the fracture toughness and the fatigue properties of these steels, and hence their response during the service, are not well known.

5000|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the word tatara is foreign to Japan, originating in India or Central Asia. There {{is a possibility that}} the word came from a place in ancient Korea, where the two dynasties would often meet. According to the Kojiki (one of the oldest Japanese historical texts), this meeting place was called Tatara-ba (たたら場) or Tatara-tsu (たたら津), and the word was possibly imported with iron-working technology. Japanese scholar Tokutaro Yasuda suggests that the word may be from the Sanskrit word tātala, meaning [...] "heat," [...] noting that the Hindi word for steel is sakeraa, which is very similar to the word kera (鉧) used in Japan for the <b>steel</b> <b>bloom</b> which the tatara produces. The two Chinese characters used when the word has the original meaning are 踏鞴 and, besides as tatara, they can be also read as fumifuigo, or foot bellows.|$|E
50|$|The {{smelting}} process used {{is different}} from the modern mass production of steel. A clay vessel about 1.1 m tall, 3 m long, and 1.1 m wide is constructed. This is known as a tatara. After the clay tub has set, it is fired until dry. A charcoal fire is started from soft pine charcoal. Then the smelter will wait for the fire to reach the correct temperature. At that point he will direct the addition of iron sand known as satetsu. This will be layered in with more charcoal and more iron sand over the next 72 hours. Four or five people need to constantly work on this process. It takes about a week to build the tatara and complete the iron conversion to steel. Because the charcoal cannot exceed the melting point of iron, the steel is not able to become fully molten, and this allows both high and low carbon material to be created and separated once cooled. When complete, the Tatara is broken to remove the <b>steel</b> <b>bloom,</b> known as a kera. At {{the end of the process}} the tatara will have consumed about 10 short ton t of satetsu and 12 short ton t of charcoal leaving about 2.5 short ton t of kera, from which less than a ton of tamahagane can be produced. A single kera can typically be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, making it many times more expensive than modern steels.|$|E

50|$|The fuel {{used was}} {{invariably}} charcoal, and {{the products were}} the bloom (a solid mass of iron) and slag (a liquid waste product). African ironworkers regularly produced inhomogeneous <b>steel</b> <b>blooms,</b> especially in the large natural-draft furnaces. The blooms invariably contained some entrapped slag, and after removal from the furnace had to be reheated and hammered to expel {{as much of the}} slag as possible. Semi-finished bars of iron or steel were widely traded in some parts of West Africa, as for example at Sukur on the Nigeria-Cameroon border, which in the nineteenth century exported thousands of bars per year north to the Lake Chad Basin. Although many African ironworkers produced <b>steel</b> <b>blooms,</b> there is little evidence in sub-Saharan as yet for hardening of steel by quenching and tempering. or for the manufacture of composite tools combining a hard steel cutting edge with a soft but tough iron body. Relatively little metallography of ancient African iron tools has yet been done, so this conclusion may perhaps be modified by future work.|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo analyse {{continuous}} casting <b>steel</b> <b>blooms</b> a removal of non-representative surface layers is required {{prior to the}} analysis. In this work, an optimized process is developed to ablate such layers and to analyse the bulk material underneath with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). A high ablation rate is crucial since the time slot for an inline analysis is limited, e. g. to < 1 min. To get {{a deeper understanding of}} the material structure between bulk material and surface, samples are sawed out of <b>steel</b> <b>blooms.</b> The samples are analysed in lab scale experiments including LIBS measurements and cross-section polish methods. These studies show that the surface layers may consist both of oxides and metallic layers and typically have thicknesses from 200 μm to 600 μm each. The ablation behaviour of the oxide differs significantly from that of the metallic layers. An operation scheme for inline material identification is worked out to perform ablation and analysis with a single laser source. During the ablation phase and the subsequent measurement phase the laser source is operated with individually tailored parameters. A total penetration depth exceeding 1 mm in steel can be achieved within 20 s of ablation. Thereby the influence of non-representative surface layers on the following LIBS measurement can be suppressed to a large extent. For chromium, relative root mean square errors of predictions of less than 13 % were achieved on high alloy samples with up to 16 m. –%Cr and on low alloy samples with Cr contents below 2 m. –%...|$|R
40|$|Continuously growing {{activity}} {{in the area of}} the engineering plastics led to the necessity of developing new low-cost, high-performance plastic mold steels. In fact, when it is necessary to fabricate large plastic components, such as bumpers and dashboards for motor vehicles, the traditionally adopted ISO 1. 2738 plastic mold steel exhibits low fracture toughness and highly inhomogeneous microstructures (continuously varying from surface to core), as obtained from the pre-hardening (quenching and tempering) of large blooms. New alloys and alternative manufacturing routes may allow to obtain plastic injection molds with good mechanical, wear and weldability properties. Precipitation hardening tool steels are being proposed for such an application, yielding improved mechanical properties and lower overall costs and lead-time. A precipitation hardenable steel, developed for injection molding of large engineering polymer components, was investigated. The microstructures and the mechanical properties of the precipitation hardenable <b>steel</b> <b>bloom</b> were investigated after the steelwork heat treatment. Moreover, the strengthening mechanism by means of aging heat treatments was examined on samples subjected either to the steelwork heat treatment only, or also to a successive laboratory heat treatment. To the purpose, X-rays diffraction and EDS analyses were carried out in order to indentify second phases electrochemically extracted from aged and not aged samples...|$|E

Each mold is expected to produce a few millions of pieces in its life. Wear under service conditions may be severe and may combine with other stresses to cause crack nucleation and failure. The present manufacturing process consists of machining pre-hardened blooms. The dimensions of the blooms use to exceed the hardenability of the steel, thus different microstructures occur at increasing depths, all of them being affected by the subsequent tempering. Due to finishing operations, any of the microstructures occurring at different positions in the original bloom {{can be found at}} the mold face.

40|$|Moulds for plastic {{automotive}} components such as bumpers and dashboards {{are usually}} machined from large pre-hardened <b>steel</b> <b>blooms.</b> Due to the blooms size, the heat {{treatment of the}} standard 1. 2738 steel produces mixed microstructures (continuously varying from surface to core) and a very low fracture toughness, that makes this steel sensible to the defects that may occur in the moulds. In the present work, two alternative steels are investigated: a quenched and tempered microalloyed steel, and a precipitation hardenable steel. Whereas the former can be subjected to the same mould production cycle currently employed for the 1. 2738 steel, the latter can be hardened by a subcritical treatment after machining. The microstructures and the ensuing mechanical behavior of steels samples, representative of different positions inside large bloom, have been examined by metallographic techniques, by fracture toughness and tensile tests, and by ensuing fractographic examinations...|$|R

Henry Bessemer supplied 500 tons of <b>steel</b> <b>blooms</b> to the London and North Western Railway's rail mill at Crewe in 1860. Several other companies began producing steel rails in the following years. The transition to steel rails was hastened {{by the introduction of}} open hearth steelmaking. William Siemens set up his Landore steelworks partly to supply rail to the Great Western Railway. A boom in rail production followed, but a banking crisis in America slowed the rate at which railways were built there and orders to British rail producers. The British iron and steel industry went into a recession, which particularly affected the wrought iron sector. When demand for rails began to grow again, it was largely for steel rails, which were more durable than those of iron.|$|R
