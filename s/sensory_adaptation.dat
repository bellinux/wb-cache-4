50|$|The {{habituation}} {{process is}} a form of adaptive behavior (or neuroplasticity) that is classified as non-associative learning. Non-associative learning is a change in a response to a stimulus that does not involve associating the presented stimulus with another stimulus or event such as a reward or punishment. (Examples of associative learning include classical conditioning and operant conditioning). Habituation is the decrease of a response to a repeated eliciting stimulus that is not due to <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptation</b> or motor fatigue. <b>Sensory</b> <b>adaptation</b> (or neural adaptation) occurs when an organism can no longer detect the stimulus as efficiently as when first presented and motor fatigue occurs when an organism is able to detect the stimulus but can no longer respond efficiently. In contrast, habituation is a learned adaptation to the repeated presentation of a stimulus, not a reduction in sensory or motor ability.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This report {{presents}} {{a case of}} apparent congenital inferior rectus palsy notable for <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptations</b> that appeared to vary with direction of gaze. It is shown that readily available clinical tests {{and an understanding of}} the physiology of ocular motility can be used to help distinguish from differential diagnoses such as contralateral inferior oblique palsy or the more commonly seen Brown syndrome. CASE REPORT: A 20 -year-old male optometry student reported strabismus that had been noted at birth and was diagnosed as Brown syndrome in childhood. The Parks three-step test showed primary gaze hypertropia that increased in left gaze but the "third step" (Bielschowsky head tilt test) was not successful in establishing the apparently correct diagnosis, which was later confirmed by a Hess screen. A proposed "fourth" step by Bajandas proved to be more accurate in this case of inferior rectus palsy. <b>Sensory</b> tests revealed <b>adaptation</b> patterns that varied with gaze direction and showed a cyclotorsional element. The patient reported being relatively unconcerned about his condition as he seemed to be able to voluntarily use a form of shallow suppression to reduce awareness of diplopic images. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is common to consider suppression and retinal correspondence status as hardwired and relatively constant for an individual patient, this case demonstrates that these <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptations</b> are likely to be far more complex and transitory. An understanding of both motor and sensory repercussions of ocular motility dysfunction assists differentiation between benign and sinister causes of nonconcomitant strabismus...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Engineers {{have long}} been {{inspired}} by nature's flyers. Such animals navigate complex environments gracefully and efficiently by {{using a variety of}} evolutionary adaptations for high-performance flight. Biologists have discovered a variety of <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptations</b> that provide flow state feedback and allow flying animals to feel their way through flight. A specialized skeletal wing structure and plethora of robust, adaptable sensory systems together allow nature's flyers to adapt to myriad flight conditions and regimes. In this work, motivated by biology and the successes of bio-inspired, engineered aerial vehicles, linear quadratic control of a flexible, morphing wing design is investigated, helping {{to pave the way for}} truly autonomous, mission-adaptive craft. The proposed control algorithm is demonstrated to morph a wing into desired positions. Furthermore, motivated specifically by the <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptations</b> organisms possess, this work transitions to an investigation of aircraft wing load identification using structural response as measured by distributed sensors. A novel, recursive estimation algorithm is utilized to recursively solve the inverse problem of load identification, providing both wing structural and aerodynamic states for use in a feedback control, mission-adaptive framework. The recursive load identification algorithm is demonstrated to provide accurate load estimate in both simulation and experiment...|$|R

50|$|Recoverin is a 23 kilodalton (kDa) {{neuronal}} calcium-binding {{protein that}} is primarily {{detected in the}} photoreceptor cells of the eye.

A reduction in this inhibition helps regulate <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptation</b> in the retina, since the light-dependent channel closure in photoreceptors causes calcium levels to decrease, which relieves the inhibition of rhodopsin kinase by calcium-bound recoverin, leading to a more rapid inactivation of metarhodopsin II (activated form of rhodopsin).|$|E
50|$|Early studies {{relied on}} the {{demonstration}} of dishabituation (the brief recovery of {{the response to the}} eliciting stimulus when another stimulus is added) to distinguish habituation from <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptation</b> and fatigue. More recently, stimulus specificity and frequency-dependent spontaneous recovery have been identified as experimental evidence for the habituation process. Sensitization is also conceptualized as a nonassociative process because it involves an increase in responding with repeated presentations to a single stimulus. Much less is understood about sensitization than habituation, but the sensitization process is often observed along with the habituation process.|$|E
50|$|Neural {{adaptation}} or <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptation</b> is {{a change}} over time in the responsiveness of the sensory system to a constant stimulus. It is usually experienced as {{a change in the}} stimulus. For example, if one rests one's hand on a table, one immediately feels the table's surface on one's skin. Within a few seconds, however, one ceases to feel the table's surface. The sensory neurons stimulated by the table's surface respond immediately, but then respond less and less until they may not respond at all; {{this is an example of}} neural adaptation.|$|E
50|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, {{a myriad of}} {{theories}} were developed for the origin of primate <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptations.</b> Evolutionary “progress” was marked by the adaptive characteristics of visual and tactile structures, yet a reduction in olfactory abilities. This theory was further elaborated by Le Gros Clark, asserting the reduction of olfactory structures was attributed to the diminished need for smell in arboreal environments. This theory was later challenged with the existence of arboreal mammals that do not exhibit primate traits that are considered “adaptive” (specifically, reduced olfaction), yet they are still successful within their respective environment. Furthermore, strepsirrhine primates demonstrate the social behavior of scent-marking in both terrestrial and arboreal habitats. Arboreal New World primates (Platyrrhini) possess skin scent-glands and also exhibit the same scent-marking traits as do strepsirrhines. Studies have provided a structural explanation for the reduced olfaction in primates, proposing that degeneration of the nasal region resulted from crowding of the nasal cavity in conjunction with progressively convergent orbits.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{transition}} from water to land {{was a key}} event {{in the evolution of}} vertebrates that occurred over a period of 15 – 20 million years {{towards the end of the}} Devonian. Tetrapods, including all land-living vertebrates, are thought to have evolved from lobe-finned (sarcopterygian) fish that developed adaptations for an amphibious existence. However, while many of the biomechanical and physiological modifications necessary to achieve this feat have been studied in detail, little is known about the <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptations</b> accompanying this transition. In this study, we investigated the visual system and visual ecology of the Australian lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri, which is the most primitive of all the lungfish and possibly the closest living relative to the ancestors of tetrapods. Results: Juvenile Neoceratodus have five spectrally distinct retinal visual pigments. A single type of rod photoreceptor contains a visual pigment with a wavelength of maximum absorbance (λmax) at 540 nm. Four spectrally distinct single cone photoreceptors contain visual pigments with λmax at 366 (UVS), 479 (SWS), 558 (MWS) and 623 nm (LWS). No double cones were found. Adult lungfish do not possess UVS cones and, unlike juveniles, have ocular media that prevent ultraviolet ligh...|$|R
50|$|It {{was using}} this {{explanation}} that academic philosophers claimed that cold, on many occasions, increases a body's temperature, and dryness increases its moisture.

It was also the understood reason for why water, such as that in wells, appeared warmer in winter than in summer (later explained {{as an example of}} <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptation).</b> It was also suggested that thunder and lightning were the results of antiperistasis caused by the coldness of the sky.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{observation}} mentioned is when {{a single}} introduction of a different stimulus late in the habituation procedure when responding to the eliciting stimulus has declined can cause {{an increase in the}} habituated response.

40|$|In {{terms of}} food-foraging, lizards usually occupy {{one of two}} {{possible}} strategies ("foraging mode"). The first one is called "sit and wait" and it is defined by waiting on one position {{for a long time}} with a minimum movements and attack is based on visual cues on prey which gets to a certain distance. The second one is the "active foraging" in which the predator moves through terrain and it detects with help of chemical cues by nasal olfactoric system or vomeronasal system, with which is able to find a prey. Sometimes the third mode is also presented as a transition - "saltatory foraging" or a continuum between two these extreme strategies. Specific variables, which reflects the activity of a predator, are used to determine the "foraging mode" - MPM, PTM, PAM and AD.

40|$|Background: Therizinosauria {{is one of}} {{the most}} enigmatic and {{peculiar}} clades among theropod dinosaurs, exhibiting an unusual suite of characters, such as lanceolate teeth, a rostral rhamphotheca, long manual claws, and a wide, opisthopubic pelvis. This specialized anatomy has been associated with a shift in dietary preferences and an adaptation to herbivory. Despite a large number of discoveries in recent years, the fossil record for Therizinosauria is still relatively poor, and cranial remains are particularly rare. Methodology/Principal Findings: Based on computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the nearly complete and articulated skull of Erlikosaurus andrewsi, as well as partial braincases of two other therizinosaurian taxa, the endocranial anatomy is reconstructed and described. The wider phylogenetic range of the described specimens permits the evaluation of sensory and cognitive capabilities of Therizinosauria in an evolutionary context. The endocranial anatomy reveals a mosaic of plesiomorphic and derived characters in therizinosaurians. The anatomy of the olfactory apparatus and the endosseous labyrinth suggests that olfaction, hearing, and equilibrium were well-developed in therizinosaurians and might have affected or benefited from an enlarged telencephalon. Conclusion/Significance: This study presents the first appraisal of the evolution of endocranial anatomy and <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptations</b> in Therizinosauria.

5000|$|Auditory {{adaptation}}, as perceptual adaptation {{with other}} senses, {{is the process}} by which individuals adapt to sounds and noises. As research has shown, as time progresses, individuals tend to adapt to sounds and tend to distinguish them less frequently after a while. <b>Sensory</b> <b>adaptation</b> tends to blend sounds into one, variable sound, rather than having several separate sounds as a series. Moreover, after repeated perception, individuals tend to adapt to sounds {{to the point where they}} no longer consciously perceive it, or rather, [...] "block it out". An individual that lives close to the train tracks, will eventually stop noticing the sounds of passing trains. Similarly, individuals living in larger cities no longer notice traffic sounds after a while.

5000|$|... "Potentiation of habituation" [...] is {{observed}} when tests of spontaneous recovery are given repeatedly. In this phenomenon, {{the decrease in}} responding that follows spontaneous recovery becomes more rapid with each test of spontaneous recovery. Also noted was that {{an increase in the}} frequency of stimulus presentation (i.e., shorter interstimulus interval) will increase the rate of habituation. Furthermore, continued exposure to the stimulus after the habituated response has plateaued (i.e., show no further decrement) may have additional effects on subsequent tests of behavior such as delaying spontaneous recovery. The concepts of stimulus generalization and stimulus discrimination will be observed. Habituation to an original stimulus will also occur to other stimuli that are similar to the original stimulus (stimulus generalization). The more similar the new stimulus is to the original stimulus, the greater the habituation that will be observed. When a subject shows habituation to a new stimulus that is similar to the original stimulus but not to a stimulus that is different from the original stimulus, then the subject is showing stimulus discrimination. (For example, if one was habituated to the taste of lemon, their responding would increase significantly when presented with the taste of lime). Stimulus discrimination can be used to rule out <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptation</b> and fatigue as an alternative explanation of the habituation process.|$|E

Differential use of the aerosphere {{is an important factor}} structuring bat assemblages, with species exhibiting distinct morphological, physiological, and <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptations</b> to different habitat types.

Recent technological advances in acoustic detection and in methods of analysis, coupled with the expansion of libraries of echolocation calls for species identification, now allow for the reliable quantification of species numbers and activity of the scarcely known group of aerial insectivorous bats, particularly in species-rich tropical assemblages. We provide a brief, exemplary overview of recent studies on bats conducted in Panamá to demonstrate the necessity of comprehensive sampling methods and application of new technologies in order to adequately depict assemblage composition and responses of bats to structural changes in habitats induced by fragmentation. In addition to acoustic methods, miniaturization of radio transmitters has provided new insights into the patterns of spatial use of the aerosphere by bats and has identified species-specific differences in mobility as one of the important traits that determines bats’ reactions to anthropogenic alterations of the landscape. Following the goals of the symposium on aeroecology, we propose new avenues of research for probing the aerosphere.

40|$|Thalattosuchians {{were highly}} {{specialised}} aquatic archosaurs of the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, and represent {{a peak of}} aquatic adaptation among crocodylomorphs. Relatively little is known of their endocranial anatomy or its relevance {{for the evolution of}} sensory systems, physiology, and other aspects of biology. Nevertheless, such data have significance for two reasons: (1) thalattosuchians represent an important data point regarding adaptation to marine life in tetrapods; and (2) as early-diverging members of the crocodylian stem-lineage, thalattosuchians provide information on the evolutionary assembly of the brain and other endocranial structures in crocodylomorphs. Here we use µCT data to virtually reconstruct the endocranial anatomy of Pelagosaurus typus, an early thalattosuchian with plesiomorphic traits of relevance to the split between the two major subgroups: Teleosauroidea and Metriorhynchoidea. Interpretation of these data in a broad comparative context indicate that several key endocranial features may be unique to thalattosuchians, including: a pyramidal morphology of the semicircular canals, the presence of an elongate endosseous cochlear duct that may indicate enhanced hearing ability, the presence of large, paired canals extending anteriorly from an enlarged pituitary fossa, a relatively straight brain (possibly due to the presence of large, laterally placed orbits), and an enlarged venous sinus projecting dorsally from the endocast that is confluent with the paratympanic sinus system. Notably, we document a large expansion of the nasal cavity anterior to the orbits in Pelagosaurus as an osteological correlate of an enlarged salt gland previously only documented in Late Jurassic metriorhynchoids. This is the first anatomical evidence of this structure in early thalattosuchians. Pelagosaurus also shares the presence of paired olfactory bulbs with metriorhynchoids, and shows an enlarged cerebrum, which may also be present in teleosauroids. Taken together, our findings indicate that physiological and <b>sensory</b> <b>adaptations</b> to marine life occurred early in thalattosuchian evolution, predating the origins of flippers, tail flukes, and hydrodynamic body forms seen later in metriorhynchoids...|$|R
