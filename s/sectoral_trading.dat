40|$|We {{develop a}} model in which <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> {{patterns}} depend on both the technology common to all sectors and the technologies specific to each sector. Changes in the common technology level affect <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> patterns through their impact on intertemporal optimization behavior, while changes in the sector-specific technology levels affect <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> patterns by influencing comparative advantage. The model shows: (1) unexpected increases in the common technology level worsen <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> balances, but expected increases in the common technology level improve them; and (2) given other countries' sectoral technology levels, an increase in a sector-specific technology level relative to other sectors improves <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> balances through its operation on comparative advantage.

40|$|In the {{negotiations}} of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), new market mechanisms are proposed to involve Non-Annex I {{countries in the}} carbon markets developed by Annex I countries, beyond their current involvement through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). <b>Sectoral</b> <b>trading</b> is one such mechanism. It would consist of coupling one economic sector of a Non-Annex I country, e. g., the Chinese electricity sector, with the carbon market of some Annex I countries, e. g., the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Previous research analyzed the potential impacts of such a mechanism and concluded that a limit would likely be set {{on the amount of}} carbon permits that could be imported from the non-Annex I country to the Annex I carbon market, should such a mechanism come into effect. This paper analyzes the impact of limited trading in carbon permits between the EU ETS and Chinese electricity sector when the latter is constrained by a 10 % emissions reduction target below business as usual by 2030. The limit on the amount of Chinese carbon permits that could be sold into the European carbon market is modeled through the introduction of a trade certificate system. The analysis employs the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model and takes into account the banking–borrowing of allowances and the inclusion of aviation emissions in the EU ETS. We find that if the amount of permits that can be imported from China to Europe is 10 % of the total amount of European allowances, the European carbon price decreases by 34 %, while it decreases by 74 % when <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading</b> is not limited. As a consequence, limited <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading</b> does not reverse the changes initiated in the European electricity sector as much as unlimited <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading</b> would. We also observe that international leakage and leakage to non-electricity sectors in China are lower under limited <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading,</b> thus achieving more emissions reductions at the aggregate level. Finally, we find that, if China can capture the rents due to the limit on <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading,</b> it is possible to find a limit that makes both regions better off relative to when there is no international trade in carbon permits.

40|$|In recent United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations, sectoral {{mechanisms}} were {{proposed as}} a way to encourage early action and spur investment in low carbon technologies in developing countries, particularly in the electricity sector. <b>Sectoral</b> <b>trading,</b> which is one such proposition, involves including a sector from one or more nations in an international cap-and-trade system. In order to assess potential impacts from such a mechanism, we analyze trade in carbon permits between the Chinese electricity sector and a U. S. economy-wide cap-and-trade program using the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model. We find that this sectoral policy induces significant financial transfers between the two countries. In 2030, the U. S. purchases permits valued at $ 42 billion from China, which represents more than 46 % of its capped emissions. Despite these transfers, there is only a small change in Chinese welfare. In the U. S., the availability of relatively cheap emissions permits significantly reduces the cost of climate policy. In China, <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading</b> increases the price of electricity and reduces the amount of electricity generated, particularly from coal, while opposite effects are observed in the U. S. Despite increases in the price of electricity in China, only small increases in electricity generation from nuclear and renewables are projected in the timeframe of our analysis (2010 - 2030). Because the price of coal decree ses, we also find that <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading</b> leads to emissions increases in non-electricity sectors in China, a form of internal carbon leakage.

40|$|This {{report is}} based on discussions in the CEPS Task Force on the Clean Development Mechanism and Future Flexible Mechanisms post- 2012, chaired by Ulrika Raab, Senior Advisor at the Swedish Energy Agency. It was assumed that {{flexible}} mechanisms will {{play a crucial role}} in facilitating a positive outcome in the UN climate change negotiations in Copenhagen in December 2009, and that they will inspire a wide range of actions by participating countries on their own and directing attention to business investment opportunities. The report outlines the various motives behind the flexible mechanisms and takes stock of the experience acquired with the existing mechanisms. Based on these insights, four options are then identified for future mechanisms – reformed CDM, reformed JI, sectoral crediting and <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading</b> – and compared against three sets of objectives – environmental integrity, enhanced investment and institutional strength at the international level. This report presents the recommendations of the CEPS Task Force, focusing not only on key features of future mechanisms but also on the institutional framework and the transition between them, with the aim of providing clarity on questions related to investors' access and more predictability about investment conditions...|$|E

The formation of the Eurozone provides a quasi-natural experiment to estimate the effects on trade of fixed exchange rates, since the change in exchange rate regime for CFA countries with all Eurozone countries but France was not trade related. This is tested using <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> data for 128 countries over the period 1995 - 2009 and validated using a larger sample of 180 countries over the period 1973 - 2013. The main departure from Frankel (2008), is the use of <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> and the inclusion of bilateral-sectoral fixed effects as well as controls for multilateral resistance, namely time varying country-fixed-effects for exporters and importers, in the gravity model specification. The main results indicate that the introduction of the Euro is generally not associated with positive effects for average trade flows between the CFA Franc Zone and other Eurozone countries. However, the results differ by sector and we find that agricultural (homogeneous products) exports from CFA countries to Euro adopters increased by almost fifty (thirty) percent after the euro adoption...|$|R

40|$|We explore short- and {{long-term}} implications of several energy scenarios of China’s role {{in efforts to}} mitigate global climate risk. The {{focus is on the}} impacts on China’s energy system and GDP growth, and on global climate indicators such as greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, and global temperature change. We employ the MIT Integrated Global System Model (IGSM) framework and its economic component, the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model. We demonstrate that China’s commitments for 2020, made during the UN climate meetings in Copenhagen and Cancun, are reachable at very modest cost. Alternative actions by China in the next 10 years do not yield any substantial changes in GHG concentrations or temperature due to inertia in the climate system. Consideration of the longer-term climate implications of the Copenhagen-type of commitments requires an assumption about policies after 2020, and the effects differ drastically depending on the case. Meeting a 2 °C target is problematic unless radical GHG emission reductions are assumed in the short-term. Participation or non-participation of China in global climate architecture can lead by 2100 to a 200 – 280 ppm difference in atmospheric GHG concentration, which can result in a 1. 1 °C to 1. 3 °C change {{by the end of the}} century. We conclude that it is essential to engage China in GHG emissions mitigation policies, and alternative actions lead to substantial differences in climate, energy, and economic outcomes. Potential channels for engaging China can be air pollution control and involvement in <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading</b> with established emissions trading systems in developed countries. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explain how Australia has bargained for {{improved}} outcomes in its trade with the United States over the 1980 s and into the early 1990 s. This explanation is sought by means of an analysis of the forces which have shaped Australia's trade policy-making towards the U. S. in the five trading sectors of wheat, sugar, beef, steel and international air passenger transport. The study adopts a theoretical framework which postulates that state actors and institutions are principally responsible for trade policy-making and the concomitant bargaining strategies adopted to improve trade outcomes. However, a state-centred approach needs to be qualified by state actors' accomodation of societal-actor demands for policy action. While exogenous to this domestic bargaining process, influences emanating from the international political economy must also be taken into account. The relationship within and between state and societal actors, influenced as they are by international institutions and ideas, are critical to understanding the bargaining approaches made by one state towards another. It is argued that <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading</b> outcomes between Australia and the U. S. can be understood by reference to a bilateral bargaining process within each trading sector. Within each such bargaining process, Australia has, within broad bilateral and multilateral approaches, devised strategies by which it could mobilize sectorally-specific resources to seek to exploit opportunities and minimise problems so as to improve its trading outcomes. The nature of these sectoral strategies has been influenced by first, the nature of the U. S. policy and policy-making process; second, the Australian domestic bargaining process between state and societal actors; and third, and to a lesser extent, prevailing ideas and the perceptions of the negotiating parties...|$|E

Chapter 4 investigates the relationship between product specific inflation (PS-inflation) and relative price variability (RPV) in one of the top three economic areas in China. My estimation model contains a broader framework, which combines both effects of expected and unexpected product specific inflation on RPV, and those effects on RPV across various inflation regimes. My empirical results suggest that the absolute value of expected PS-inflation negatively affects RPV, and this effect reverses to be positive under the region of negative inflation, which is consistent with "asymmetric price adjustment"· in literature. On the other hand, absolute value of unexpected PS-inflation positively affect RPV when inflation rate is negative. An economical recession has different impacts on the effect of PS-inflation on RPV across different inflation regimes. Also, Chinese New Year has shown to exaggerate the effect of either expected or unexpected PS-inflation on RPV. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

In order to evaluate the EU economic integration effects across sectors, I build up a sectoral gravity model.

Trade within Europe is still impeded by significant barriers. In particular, there remain many non-tariff barriers, including so-called TBT "Technical Barriers to Trade”.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper tests this condition for the trade between Sri Lanka and China in two steps. First, it investigates the exchange rate movements on Sri Lanka's aggregate exports and imports between China using selected variables such as the real bilateral exchange rate change, the change in income and the exchange rate volatility. Second, this study constructs a panel regression model using Sri Lanka's sectoral exports and imports between China and tests whether exchange rate movements have detrimental effects on <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade.</b> Findings – The main finding is that bilateral exchange rate changes and exchange rate volatility do play an active role on trade, while income growth changes have less influence in determining the total exports and imports between two countries. The analysis of data shows that changes in real bilateral exchange rate, income and exchange rate volatility are playing a major role in determining sectoral exports and imports between Sri Lanka and China. Therefore, the findings suggest that the movements of exchange rate between these two countries do have significant effects on total trade as well as <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> between Sri Lanka and China.

It identifies six distinct aspects of the relationship that may underlie the continuing friction: bilateral imbalance on merchandise trade, capital flows from Japan to the United States, the yen/dollar exchange rate, <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> distortions, Japan's technological catch-up, and societal differences. For each source of conflict, the main causes and potential remedies are assessed. Several important conclusions emerge from the analysis. First, although the bilateral trade and capital-account imbalances were produced primarily by macroeconomic factors and can therefore be viewed as "temporary" rather than long-term developments, elimination of the imbalances without serious damage {{may be difficult to}} achieve. In terms of sectoral adjustments, the U. S. -Japan relationship is entering a new phase as the two nations grow more similar in terms of technology base, abundance of capital and skilled labor, and per capita income. Two-way trade in technology and in technology-based services will become increasingly important, while both nations will cope with similar problems of adjustment to pressure from a new tier of competitors in Asia and elsewhere. As the aggregate imbalances diminish, <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> conflict will be concentrated on the two ends of the technology spectrum, with issues raised both by conflicting approaches to the phasing out of uncompetitive industries and by the nurturing of new technology-based industries. ...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary draft- {{comments}} are welcome Abstract: This paper studies {{the impact of}} trade on the price-elasticity of aggregate labour demand, {{based on the idea}} that a variation in the cost of (a given type of) labour has an effect on the <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> specialisation of an economy, at the expense of the domestic productions using this factor intensively, even when the trade balance is kept unchanged. As this effect is more important the more open the economy, trade openness induces an increase in the associated labour-demand elasticity, through an "international competitiveness effect". This argument is illustrated by a simple model, based on an Armington hypothesis, with an empirical assessment for France. JEL Classification: F 16...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary Version What do we {{know about}} cross country {{differences}} in sectoral productivity? Not much, even though they {{are at the heart of}} trade theory and many stories explaining cross country income differences. In this paper we fill this gap by using a Hybrid-Ricardo-Heckscher-Ohlin trade model and bilateral <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> and production data to overcome the data problem that has plagued previous studies. We provide a comparable set of sectoral total factor productivities (TFP) for 24 manufacturing sectors and more than fifty countries at all stages of development. Our results show that TFP differences in manufacturing sectors between rich and poor countries are substantial and far more pronounced in skill intensive sectors...|$|R
40|$|China's <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> composition, {{product quality}} mix, and the import content of {{processing}} exports have all changed substantially {{during the past}} decade. This has rendered trade elasticities estimated using aggregate data highly unstable, with more recent data pointing to significantly higher demand and price elasticities. Sectoral differences in these parameters are also very wide. All this suggests greater caution should be exercised when using historical data to simulate the response of China's economy to external shocks and exchange rate changes. Analyses based on models with estimated coefficients largely representative of China in the 1980 s and 1990 s are likely {{to turn out to}} be wrong, perhaps even dramatically.
