The collision caused extensive damage to the smaller ship. At first it appeared that Olympic had sustained only minor damage, but it was later revealed that her sternpost had been fractured, necessitating the replacement of her entire <b>stern</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
25|$|Riou {{positioned}} himself near the iceberg, and despatched boats {{to collect the}} ice. By the time the last boats had been recovered night had fallen, when a sudden fogbank descended, hiding the iceberg from view. Riou {{found himself in a}} dangerous situation. Somewhere to leeward lay a large mass of ice, concealed in the darkness and fog. He posted lookouts in the bows and rigging, and began to edge slowly forward. After sometime the danger seemed to be past, and the iceberg left behind, when at 9 o'clock a strange pale glow was reported by the lookout in the bows. Riou ordered the helm to turn hard a starboard, turning into the wind as a wall of ice higher than the ship's masts slid by along the side. It briefly appeared that the danger had been avoided, but as she passed by the Guardian struck an underwater projection with a sudden crash. Caught in a sudden gust of wind the ship reared up and swung about, driving the stern into the ice, smashing away the rudder, shattering her <b>stern</b> <b>frame</b> and tearing a large gash in the hull. Despite the seriousness of the situation Riou remained calm, using the sails to pull clear of the ice, and then taking stock of the damage.|$|E

500|$|... d. [...] Lucas {{described}} {{the scene on}} Redoutable: In less {{than half an hour}} our ship had been so fearfully mauled that she looked like little more than a heap of debris. Judging by appearances, no doubt, the Temeraire, now hailed us to surrender and not prolong a useless resistance. My reply was instantly to order some soldiers who were near me to fire back; which they did with great alacrity. At the same moment almost, the main mast of the Redoutable fell on board the English ship. The two topmasts of the Temeraire then came down, falling on board of us. Our whole poop was stove in, helm rudder and stern post all shattered to splinters, all the <b>stern</b> <b>frame,</b> and the decks shot through. All our own guns were either smashed or dismounted by the broadsides of the Victory and the Temeraire...The hull itself was riddled, shot through from side to side; deck beams were shattered, port lids torn away or knocked to pieces. Four of our six pumps were so damaged as to be useless. The quarter-deck ladders were broken, which rendered communication {{with the rest of the}} ship very difficult. Everywhere the decks were strewn with dead men, lying beneath the debris. Out of a crew of 634 men we had 522 hors de combat; of whom 300 were killed and 222 wounded nearly all the officers among them... The batteries and upper decks were practically abandoned – bare of men and were unable longer to offer any resistance. No one who had not seen the state of Redoutable could ever form an idea of her awful condition. Really I know of nothing on board that had not been hit by shot.|$|E

5000|$|All {{three had}} fine lines at bow and <b>stern,</b> uniform <b>frames</b> mid-ships with concave and convex sweeps {{and a deep}} keel. Their length to beam ratio was unusually high, giving them a {{remarkable}} turn of speed. The foremast was square rigged while the other three or four masts were fore-and-aft rigged, barquentine fashion but carrying very simplified standing and running rigging. Each sail was equipped with a horizontal sprit that enabled it to be brailed up to its mast and deployed rapidly. Each mast carried three sails. The topmasts could be lowered and replaced from the deck, in the event the sprits were to fail in strong gales {{and had to be}} abandoned. The Patent granted to Gower in 1799 details his theory about the relationship between speed and the length to beam ratio, as well as details of many features of his novel form of rigging, which allowed almost all activities normally conducted aloft to be performed from the deck (including the replacement of damaged masts) thus only the foremast was fitted with ratlines.|$|R

40|$|The {{innovative}} {{capacity of a}} country is the basic driving force behind its economic performance; it provides {{a measure of the}} institutional structures and support systems that sustain innovative activity. Recent work, such as that by Furman, Porter and <b>Stern</b> (FP&S) <b>frames</b> a concept of national innovation capacity measured by patenting rates, and estimates its institutional sources for a group of 17 OECD countries. In this present paper, we extend and modify the FP&S approach by applying it to five “latecomer” countries from East Asia, none of which was included in the FP&S study. First, we reproduce the FP&S methodology in relation to the five East Asian countries, gathering comparable data over a comparable (but truncated) time period. While our results are in broad agreement with the findings of FP&S, we document some important differences for latecomer East Asian economies: a smaller number of national factors matter, {{and there seems to be}} an important (though subtle) role for public R&D expenditure. These findings have important implications for successful catch-up strategies. We supplement these aggregate findings with firm- and institution-level data from Taiwan, where the breakthrough to innovation has arguably proceeded farther than in any other East Asian country. In these ways, we shed light on the process through which a latecomer country is able to close the gap with the more developed countries, by channeling resources towards the raising of its {{innovative capacity}}. 28 page(s...|$|R

Despite the seriousness of the situation, Riou remained calm, using the sails to pull clear of the ice, and then taking stock of the damage.Now clear of the immediate danger of the ice, Riou found himself in a desperate situation. There was two feet of water in the hold and more was rushing in, while the sea was rising and a gale had sprung up. The pumps were manned, but could not keep up with the influx of water, and by midnight there was 6 feet of water in the hold. At dawn on Christmas Day, an attempt was made to fother the hull, which involved lowering an oakum-packed studding sail over the side to cover the gash in the hull and slow the flooding. This was temporarily successful and by 11 o'clock the pumps had been able to reduce the water to a level of 19 inches. The respite was short-lived, as the sail split under the pressure of the water and the water level began to rise again. A number of seaman requested permission to take to the ship's boats. Riou convinced them to stay, but another attempt to fother the hull with another sail failed when the sail immediately ripped. By nightfall on 25 December, the water in the hold had risen to 7 feet, and the ship was rolling violently, allowing water to pour over the ship's side. Riou ordered the stores, guns and livestock to be thrown overboard in an attempt to lighten the ship, but was injured when his hand was crushed by a falling cask while trying to clear the bread-room. By morning the next day, the ship was settling by the stern, while the sails had been torn away in the gale. Again the seamen, this time joined by the convicts, requested to be allowed to take to the boats. Riou at last agreed to this, well aware that there were not enough boats for everyone, and announced 'As for me, I have determined to remain in the ship, and shall endeavour to make my presence useful {{as long as there is}} any occasion for it.' ...|$|E
