5|$|Between 2006 and 2007, Texas spent $7,275 {{per pupil}} ranking it below the {{national}} average of $9,389. The pupil/teacher ratio was 14.9, {{below the national}} average of 15.3. Texas paid instructors $41,744, {{below the national average}} of $46,593. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) administers the state's public school systems. Texas has over 1,000 school districts- all districts except the Stafford Municipal School District are independent from municipal government and many cross city boundaries. School districts have the power to tax their residents and to assert eminent domain over privately owned property. Due to court-mandated equitable school financing for school districts, the state has a controversial tax redistribution system called the"Robin Hood plan". This plan transfers property tax revenue from wealthy <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> poor ones. The TEA has no authority over private or home school activities.|$|E
5|$|Within {{months of}} {{arriving}} in Washington, D.C., Fletcher {{was selected as}} the leadership liaison for the 17-member freshman class of Republican legislators. He was appointed to the Committee on Education and Workforce, and John Boehner, chair of the committee's employer/employee relations subcommittee, chose Fletcher as his vice-chair. The committee's purpose is to oversee the rules for employer-paid health plans, among other issues, and although it is rare for a freshman legislator to attain a committee leadership post, Boehner cited Fletcher's experience in the medical field and work on reforming the Kentucky health care system as reasons for the appointment. Fletcher also served {{as a member of the}} House Committees on the Budget and Agriculture. In June 1999, he sponsored an amendment to a youth violence bill that allowed <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> use federal funds to develop curricula which included elements designed to promote and enhance students' moral character; the amendment passed 422â€”1. Later, Fletcher was assigned to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and was selected as chairman of the Policy Subcommittee on Health.|$|E

25|$|During the Speaker's term, teacher benefit {{reforms were}} also accomplished. The legislation, which is {{described}} as the biggest change in the state's teacher retirement system in a generation, allows <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> allocate less towards retirement pensions and more towards students. School district leaders have noted the change to retirement pension requirements have been a blessing, saying the separation allows <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> spend more on school operations. The reform also created the option for teachers to commit more towards their own retirement, or have the option for a smaller pension.|$|E

25|$|De jure {{educational}} segregation {{continued into the}} 1950s, and de facto segregation continued into the 1970s, leading to a court challenge and interdistrict desegregation agreement.

25|$|The {{first step}} was to secure {{retirement}} benefits for custodians throughout the state. In 1928, just a year after CSEA formed, the union helped push through SB 551, which allowed <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> establish retirement benefits for all school employees, not just teachers. More importantly, it became the first law on the books recognizing school employees other than teachers and administrators.|$|E
25|$|Owing to the {{extremely}} large number (730) of school districts, {{many of which}} are quite small, most of them are organized into 37 supervisory districts. Each of these has a Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES). Each BOCES provides services that are considered difficult for the member <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> provide on their own, often including special classes for students with disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Common school districts, {{established}} in 1812, {{were the first}} type of school district in the state. In July 2004, there were only 11 such districts remaining. They are not authorized to provide secondary education. They must, therefore, contract with neighboring <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> provide high school education for pupils in the district. Typically one trustee or a three-person board of trustees will govern the district.|$|E

25|$|While in office, Lynch has {{advocated}} for stricter laws regarding drunken-driving {{and the use}} of handguns. He has also proposed measures that would link school attendance rates and teenagers' driving privileges, increase penalties against people who provide alcohol to minors, and require <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> put in place anti-bullying and school-safety plans. He has also called for community prosecution, and has paired state prosecutors with police personnel in Providence Police Department's neighborhood precincts with the goal of timely prosecution of drug crimes, robbery, and assault.|$|E
25|$|A {{proposal}} has been made, by prominent local citizen, David Wassel, to consolidate many Allegheny County <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> save tax dollars and improve student services. The {{plan calls for}} a new district that combines: West Mifflin Area School District, Duquesne City School District and Steel Valley School District. The new district would serve the communities of: Duquesne City, Homestead, Munhall, West Homestead, West Mifflin, Whitaker. The high school in Duquesne School District was closed in 2007 due to low achievement, district financial distress, and low enrollment.|$|E

25|$|NYSUT {{continued}} to expand collective bargaining rights for teachers as well. In 1981, the union won {{passage of a}} law granting collective bargaining rights for substitute teachers. In 1982, the state legislature passed the Triborough Amendment to the Taylor Law. Many school districts ceased to honor clauses they disliked in expired teacher union contracts, which led many locals to strike. The Triborough Amendment required <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> honor the entire contract until a new agreement was reached, {{and the number of}} strikes fell drastically.|$|E
25|$|Following Act 72, Rendell and the Pennsylvania {{legislature}} {{looked at}} other proposals to reduce property taxes, {{a key component}} of his 2002 campaign. The governor said he was willing to consider legislation that changes Act 72, and legislative proposals were made to force <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> accept the money. Other proposed legislation would have required the issue to be voted on in each district as a ballot question, rather than decided by school boards. Property tax relief and Act 72 were issues of great controversy and have been subject to political gridlock, and it was unclear when changes would be made.|$|E
25|$|The Florida statewide {{teachers}}' {{strike of}} 1968 was a strike {{action in the}} state of Florida in February and March 1968 by teachers and other education workers belonging to the Florida Education Association (FEA). The cause of the strike was under-funding of the state's educational system at a time when attendance was rising sharply, and low pay and benefits for teachers. The strike lasted from a few days in some <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> three months in others. Although a special session of the Florida Legislature approved higher taxes to pay for more school funding, FEA members felt the funding hikes were not enough and voted to continue striking. No additional funding was forthcoming, however, and most local affiliates of the FEA settled their contracts and went back to work by March.|$|E
