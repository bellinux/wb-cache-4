40|$|Data {{assimilation}} {{techniques were}} used to estimate forest <b>stand</b> <b>data</b> in 2011 by sequentially combining remote sensing based estimates of forest variables with predictions from growth models. Estimates of <b>stand</b> <b>data,</b> based on canopy height models obtained from image matching of digital aerial images at six different time-points between 2003 and 2011, served as input to the data assimilation. The assimilation routines were built on the extended Kalman filter. The {{study was conducted in}} hemi-boreal forest at the Remningstorp test site in southern Sweden (lat. 13 ° 37 ′ N; long. 58 ° 28 ′ E). The assimilation results were compared with two other methods used in practice for estimation of forest variables: the first was to use only the most recent estimate obtained from remotely sensed data (2011) and the second was to forecast the first estimate (2003) to the endpoint (2011). All three approaches were validated using nine 40 m radius validation plots, which were carefully measured in the field. The results showed that the data assimilation approach provided better results than the two alternative methods. Data assimilation of remote sensing time series has been used previously for calibrating forest ecosystem models, but, to our knowledge, this is the first study with real data where data assimilation has been used for estimating forest inventory data. The study constitutes a starting point {{for the development of a}} framework useful for sequentially utilizing all types of remote sensing data in order to provide precise and up-to-date estimates of forest stand parameters...|$|E

The algorithm was calibrated on the landscape level with tree geometry and forest <b>stand</b> <b>data</b> at the Fazenda Cauaxi (3. 75 ° S, 48. 37 ° W) in the eastern Amazon, and then compared with forest <b>stand</b> <b>data</b> at Tapajos National Forest (3. 08 ° S, 54. 94 ° W) in the central Amazon. The average remotely sensed crown width (mean ± SE) was 12. 7 ± 0. 1 m (range: 2. 0 – 34. 0 m) and frequency of trees was 76. 6 trees/ha at Cauaxi. At Tapajos, remotely sensed crown width was 13. 1 ± 0. 1 m (range: 2. 0 – 38. 0 m) and frequency of trees was 76. 4 trees/ha. At both Cauaxi and Tapajos, the remotely sensed average crown widths were within 3 percent of the crown widths derived from field measurements, although crown distributions showed significant differences between field-measured and automated methods. We used the remote sensing algorithm to estimate crown dimensions and forest structural properties in 51 forest stands (1 km 2) throughout the Brazilian Amazon. The estimated crown widths, tree diameters (dbh), and stem frequencies differed widely among sites, while estimated biomass was similar among most sites. Sources of observed errors included an inability to detect understory crowns and to separate adjacent, intermingled crowns. Nonetheless, our technique can serve {{to provide information about}} structural characteristics of large areas of unsurveyed forest throughout Amazonia...|$|E

40|$|Many change {{agents in}} western forests, such as fire, wind, drought, and beetle outbreaks, are episodic, and {{although}} they can occur on decadal frequencies – a long time horizon for most research – forest stands that are centuries old have likely experienced these disturbances many times. Each of these episodic disturbances affects different species and different diameter classes with patterns that can be random, highly aggregated, or overdispersed. The observed variation in both the distribution and sizes of forest trees in primary forests therefore represents the integration of many occurrences of these episodic disturbances over tree lifespans. Attempts to restore forest composition and structure are more difficult when the range of structural heterogeneity is poorly understood, and if heterogeneity is underestimated, ecosystem function in restored stands may be limited. Better understanding of forest structure and structural development requires large data sets that can capture the variation present within forest <b>stands.</b> <b>Data</b> sets must include sufficient spatial representation for elucidation of characteristic patterns, and also sufficient temporal depth to understand the range of variation of demographic processes...|$|R

40|$|LOCCOST is an {{interactive}} computer program that predicts stump to mill logging costs, stumpage and {{net present value}} of a harvest based on <b>stand</b> <b>data,</b> pond value and logging parameters, entered by the user. The program is intended for use by foresters to evaluate the economics of different stand management strategies. It is also useful in deciding whether commercial thinning of existing stands is profitable. The current version is designed for use in southwestern Idaho, but minor changes could be made which would extend the applicability {{to other parts of}} the USDA, Forest Service, Intermountain Region. Approximately two minutes is required to enter data, and program execution takes approximately 15 seconds, using an IBM Personal Computer. LOCCOST is compiled in BASIC and loLL 4. Julian Sessions will run on microcomputers that have at least 256 K RAM and are IBM compatible. Documentation of the model and a Users' Guide are included in the Appendices. Felling and bucking, as well as yarding production, computed by LOCCOST compared favorably with other studies. Stump to truck logging costs are significantly lower than the cost estimated by the Intermountain Region Timber Appraisal Handbook. Preliminary testing of this harvest cost model, using <b>stand</b> <b>data</b> from the Boise National Forest in southwestern Idaho, suggests that the model is sensitive to such variables as tree size, species, volume per acre cut, logging system, terrain, and distance to the mill. Differences in thinning intensity, and past stand history (precommercial thinning) also result in differences in harvest cost per mbf, when modeled by LOCCOST. The results of alternative stand management strategies tested suggest that precommercial thinning may be necessary to produce profitable stands on average sites, if rotations less than 100 years are desired...|$|E
