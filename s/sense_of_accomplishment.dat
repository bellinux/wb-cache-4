Carter from Destructoid {{thought that the}} fortress and the outpost system provided players with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> and success, and he considered having the freedom to use different ways to approach and complete missions {{one of the greatest}} parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series. However he criticized the upgrade system, which he thought was directly converted from Far Cry 3 and was uninspiring. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Harmon thought that the introduction of the helicopter was dull. Mitch Dyer, from IGN, praised the game's economy system, which he thought was satisfying. He added that it gives players motivations to complete side-quests. Justin McElroy of Polygon praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.|$|E
25|$|The first ostensive {{goal of a}} BMX racer is {{to become}} the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up into several Districts {{depending}} how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. Too many people in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing his point score up the list of total points {{in relation to other}} racers. Too small a district would cheapen any <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine how well you do in the district rankings. How high you go in the rankings depends on what skill level category you are in as well as how well you do in your particular races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to your total for your district ranking. The higher your skill level, the more points you will gather at any given race (providing that you have qualified for the Main).|$|E
25|$|Promoting {{independence}} in self-care can provide {{older adults with}} the capability to maintain independence longer and can leave them {{with a sense of}} achievement when they complete a task unaided. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with self-care tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to be conscious of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the older adult is able to complete self-care activities on their own, or even if they need supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can provide them with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> and the ability to maintain independence longer.|$|E

Six former national junior tennis players who were identified as burned out underwent a structured interview exploring their experiences of burnout. Content analysis identified symptoms and consequences specific to each burnout dimension, but also considerable overlap and interrelationships among dimensions. In more severe cases of burnout, consequences continued after departure from the sport and were salient in non-athletic domains. Considerable significance was attached to reduced <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> athletic <b>accomplishment,</b> diverging from work-related literature where this burnout dimension is considered of limited importance (Cox, Tisserand, & Taris, 2005) ...|$|R

While the advancement and the sophistication of the intranet is progressing tremendously, research on intranet utilization is still very scant. This paper is an attempt to provide a conceptual understanding of the intranet utilization and the corresponding antecedents and impacts through the proposed conceptual model. Based on several research frameworks built through past research, the authors attempt to propose a framework for studying intranet utilization that is based on three constructs i. e. mode of utilizations, decision support and knowledge sharing. Three groups of antecedent variables namely intranet, organizational and individual characteristics are explored to determine their possible contribution to intranet utilization. In addition, the impacts of intranet utilization are also examined in terms of task productivity, task innovation and individual <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishments.</b> Based on the proposed model, several propositions are formulated as a basis for the study that will follow...|$|R

500|$|The {{walking and}} driving {{controls}} were criticized. Bramwell claimed that these modes felt [...] "like they've been attached {{with an old}} stick of glue that's about as adhesive as baby oil". Knutson agreed, though he praised the novelty of these diversions. He stated that [...] "the Tony Hawk series has always had exceptional controls" [...] and that Underground, overall, was no exception. Perry felt that the feature increased levels' replay value. Similarly, Famitsu reviewers noted that, although the game's fast pace makes it extremely challenging at times, the high difficulty provides a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> when jumps and tricks are performed correctly. Williams found the GameCube version's controls mediocre, albeit manageable. Damon Brown from GameSpot stated that the mobile version's restrictive controls‚Äîmany tricks require three button inputs‚Äîwere that version's only caveat.|$|E
500|$|Critics also {{consider}} Steinbock important {{because of his}} artistic genius. Like Louis Lambert and Lucien Chardon in Illusions perdues, he is a brilliant man‚Äì just as Balzac considered himself to be. Before he is nurtured and directed by Bette, however, Steinbock's genius languishes under his own inertia and he attempts suicide. Later, when he leaves Bette's circle of influence, he fails again. Thus he demonstrates Balzac's conviction that genius alone is useless without determination. Bellos organizes Steinbock and Bette into a duality of weakness and strength; whereas the Polish artist is unable to direct his energies into productive work, Bette draws strength from her virginity and thus becomes powerful by denying the lust to which Steinbock falls prey. Steinbock's drive is further eroded by the praise he receives for his art, which gives him an inflated <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment.</b> One critic refers to the artist's downfall as [...] "vanity... spoiled by premature renown".|$|E

Glass Joe later appeared in Punch-Out!! for the NES in 1987. While he did not appear in the SNES game's sequel, he opened a boxing school for potential fighters.

500|$|Other {{gameplay}} aspects received mixed reviews.

Brown criticized the game for failing to offer much challenge or a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> to players. He called the health system a redundant addition in which resources, such as water and food, play an insignificant role and can be neglected by players. Brown also criticized the scrap-collecting system, writing that it frustrated most players and slowed the game's pace. However, Robinson wrote that those elements reflect the barbarian nature of the wasteland. He praised its world design (which he thought echoed the films), describing it as [...] "a world of twisted metal and sudden violence that's there to be survived rather than conquered". Bloodworth criticized the game's stronghold system, which he called repetitive. Brown criticized the game's lack of a climbing system, which hinders movement; this was echoed by Carter.|$|E
500|$|Crocs game {{mechanics}} {{were designed}} by Keating and lead designer Nic Cusworth. The game's levels were divided into several sub-sections due to technical limitations {{at the time and}} Argonaut's desire to not have to deal with creating convincing depth perception. The team designed the game's levels with the mindset of having each individual room feel like its own individual puzzle that would give the player a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> whenever they completed it. Cusworth came up with the names for many of the levels, several of which were references to other pieces of popular culture; the game's first level, named [...] "...And So The Adventure Begins", was a reference to the title card of the music video for the David Lee Roth song Yankee Rose, which Cusworth found in a video collection that he owned at the time.

According to Nakazawa, bad endings were painful to write, but were included both as foils to the good ending to increase the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> in reaching the good ending, and as [...] "what if?" [...] events that give the story variety, showing what would have happened had events played out differently. The game's epilogue was not originally planned, but was written by Uchikoshi in three days after being advised by Nakazawa. When a PlayStation Portable version was developed, Nakazawa was asked to create new content for it; as it would have been hard to expand the story or add new event computer graphics artwork (CGs), it was decided to create an in-game dictionary explaining terms used to allow players to enjoy the game on a deeper level.|$|E
