Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no <b>single</b> <b>technique</b> but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs.

5|$|Several scales {{exist to}} grade the {{severity}} of acne vulgaris, but no <b>single</b> <b>technique</b> has been universally accepted as the diagnostic standard. Cook's acne grading scale uses photographs to grade severity from 0 to 8 (0 being the least severe and 8 being the most severe). This scale {{was the first to}} use a standardized photographic protocol to assess acne severity; since its creation in 1979, the scale has undergone several revisions. The Leeds acne grading technique counts acne lesions on the face, back, and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Leeds scores range from 0 (least severe) to 10 (most severe) though modified scales have a maximum score of 12. The Pillsbury acne grading scale simply classifies {{the severity of}} the acne from 1 (least severe) to 4 (most severe).|$|E

25|$|Anger treatments' {{success rates}} can be {{difficult}} to estimate because excessive, severe anger is not a recognized disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This manual is used as a reference for mental health professionals. Some research does exist on comparing various treatments for anger, but they also describe methodological difficulties in making accurate comparisons. The most concrete evidence for anger treatment is that multiple techniques have proven to be more successful than a <b>single</b> <b>technique.</b> The relaxation approach had the highest success rate as a standalone treatment. The effectiveness of the CBT-based anger management therapies has been evaluated by a number of meta-analyses. In a 1998 meta-analysis with 50 studies and 1640 individuals, measures of anger and aggression were used to compare the effects of the anger management intervention with no treatment. A significant effect for anger management was found with a 67% chance of improvement for individuals having received the anger management as compared to the individuals without the therapy. In addition, a 2009 meta-analysis compared psychological treatments for anger across 96 studies. After an average of 8 sessions, a significant improvement in anger reduction resulted. Overall, the completion of an anger management program is likely to result in long lasting positive changes in behavior. Successful interventions can result in not only a reduction of the outward display of aggression, but also a decrease in the internal level of anger.|$|E

We evaluated the dosimetric and temporal gains using the <b>single</b> isocenter <b>technique</b> compared to classic source to skin distance (SSD) technique. Methods: 6 patients of breast cancer localization were studied. For each patient 2 treatment plans were generated. In plan 1 the dose was calculated using SSD technique. In plan 2 the dose was calculated using <b>single</b> isocenter <b>technique.</b> To implement the plan 2 a dosimetric analysis including monitor units (MU), isodose curves, cumulative and differential dose volume histograms cDVH, dDVH respectively, coverage index, conformity index for planning target volume were used. The measurements using a PMMA phantom consist of measuring point dose by an ionization chamber and 2 D dose distributions using 2 D diodes arrays. Wilcoxon signed rank and Spearman’s tests were used to calculate p-value and correlation coefficient, respectively. Results: The <b>single</b> isocenter <b>technique</b> reduced the MU by average on - 30. 1 ± 13. 6 %, (p = 0. 03). We observed an improvement with statistical significance between the two techniques for the mean dose, minimum dose and volume receiving 95 % of the prescribed dose without over-dosage. The analysis for dDVH showed that the dose distribution in the target volume calculated in the <b>single</b> isocenter <b>technique</b> is more homogeneous than the SSD technique. Wilcoxon test showed that the two treatment plans had the same quality (p > 0. 05). The difference between calculated and measured dose was within 2. 4 ± 3. 3 % for absolute point dose {{and the percentage of}} points passing gamma criteria was on average 99. 8 ± 0. 2 %. Conclusion: This method provides a quantitative evaluation and comparison of the two irradiation techniques for breast cancer and the consequences of the technical change on dose calculation...|$|R
