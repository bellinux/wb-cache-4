5|$|Potemkin {{reached its}} {{destination}} at 23:00 on 7 July and the Romanians {{agreed to give}} asylum to the crew if they would disarm themselves and surrender the battleship. Ismails crew decided the following morning to return to Sevastopol and turn themselves in, but Potemkins crew voted to accept the terms. Captain Negru, commander of the port, came aboard at noon and hoisted the Romanian flag and then allowed the ship to enter the inner harbor. Before the crew disembarked, Matushenko ordered that the Potemkins Kingston valves be opened so Potemkin would <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom.|$|E
5|$|Growth is slow, and the veligers {{are carried}} by the ocean {{currents}} for up to 14 weeks. As the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ocean floor. As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E
5|$|Selected {{as one of}} the Mercury Seven astronauts, Grissom was {{the pilot}} of the second American {{suborbital}} flight, in the Liberty Bell 7. The hatch of the craft blew off and filled with water, causing it to <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the ocean. His next flight was in the Project Gemini Program in a craft named the Molly Brown, which was a successful mission. He was killed along with fellow astronauts Ed White and Roger Chaffee during a pre-launch test for the Apollo 1 mission at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (then known as Cape Kennedy), Florida. He {{was the first of the}} Mercury Seven to die. He was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross and, posthumously, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.|$|E

25|$|The bridge's {{two towers}} were built by {{floating}} two caissons, giant upside-down boxes made of southern yellow pine, {{in the span}} of the East River, and then beginning <b>to</b> build <b>the</b> stone towers on top of them until they <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the river. Compressed air was pumped into the caissons, and workers entered <b>the</b> space <b>to</b> dig <b>the</b> sediment, until <b>the</b> caissons <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bedrock. The whole weight of the bridge still sits upon a 15-foot thickness of southern yellow pine wood under the sediment.|$|R

5|$|During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a {{state of}} torpor and remain {{inactive}} for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. Those that live on land such as the American toad (Bufo americanus) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) normally <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by {{a high concentration of}} glucose. An apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and the heart beat can restart when conditions warm up.|$|E
5|$|Females {{typically}} {{lay between}} {{four hundred and}} three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped {{onto the surface of}} the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the tip of her abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while standing next to the water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or diapause. The larval growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Mating is {{initiated}} when {{up to five}} males follow closely {{behind a}} female and bite at her fins and body, possibly cued by pheromones indicating the female's readiness. Each male attempts to seize the female by engulfing one of her pectoral fins; at times two males might grasp a female on both sides simultaneously. Once engaged, the sharks <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom, whereupon the male (or males) rotates one of his claspers forward, inflates the associated siphon sac (a subcutaneous abdominal organ that takes in seawater {{that is used to}} flush sperm into the female), and attempts to make contact with the female's vent. In many cases, the female resists by pressing her belly against the bottom and arching her tail; this may reflect mate choice on her part. The male has a limited time in which to achieve copulation, as while he is holding the female's pectoral fin in his mouth he is being deprived of oxygen. On the other hand, if the female is willing, the pair settles side-by-side with their heads pressed against the bottom and their bodies at an upward angle.|$|E

5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom and pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process {{them in the same}} way as the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15â€“20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E
5|$|Fluctuations in {{the orbits}} of the moons {{indicate}} that their mean density decreases with distance from Jupiter. Callisto, the outermost and least dense of the four, has a density intermediate between ice and rock whereas Io, the innermost and densest moon, has a density intermediate between rock and iron. Callisto has an ancient, heavily cratered and unaltered ice surface {{and the way it}} rotates indicates that its density is equally distributed, suggesting that it has no rocky or metallic core but consists of a homogeneous mix of rock and ice. This may well have been the original structure of all the moons. The rotation of the three inner moons, in contrast, indicates differentiation of their interiors with denser matter at the core and lighter matter above. They also reveal significant alteration of the surface. Ganymede reveals past tectonic movement of the ice surface which required partial melting of subsurface layers. Europa reveals more dynamic and recent movement of this nature, suggesting a thinner ice crust. Finally, Io, the innermost moon, has a sulfur surface, active volcanism and no sign of ice. All this evidence suggests that the nearer a moon is to Jupiter the hotter its interior. The current model is that the moons experience tidal heating {{as a result of the}} gravitational field of Jupiter in inverse proportion to the square of their distance from the giant planet. In all but Callisto this will have melted the interior ice, allowing rock and iron to <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interior and water to cover the surface. In Ganymede a thick and solid ice crust then formed. In warmer Europa a thinner more easily broken crust formed. In Io the heating is so extreme that all the rock has melted and water has long ago boiled out into space.|$|E
5|$|The Puranas {{introduce}} {{themes that}} are echoed in later works, including the deception of the unsuspecting Ahalya by Indra's devious disguise as Gautama in his absence. The Padma Purana states that after Gautama leaves for his ritual bath, Indra masquerades as Gautama and asks Ahalya to satisfy him. Ahalya, engrossed in worship, rejects him, considering it inappropriate {{to have sex}} {{at the cost of}} neglecting the gods. Indra reminds her that her first duty is to serve him. Finally Ahalya gives in, but Gautama learns of Indra's deception through his supernatural powers and returns to the ashram. A similar account is found in the Brahma Purana. At times, Indra {{takes the form of a}} cock that crows to dispatch Gautama for his morning ablutions, as in the 18th-century Telugu rendition of the tale by the warrior-poet Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka of the Madurai Nayak Dynasty. In other versions, he uses an accomplice, such as the moon-god Chandra, to distract Gautama. In the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Ahalya comes to bathe in the Svarnadi (heavenly river) and Indra becomes infatuated with her when he sees her. Assuming Gautama's form, Indra has sex with her until they <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river bed in exhaustion. However, Gautama catches them in the act. Another version in the same Purana focuses on the question of how the chaste Ahalya was seduced by Indra. In this version, Indra approaches Ahalya on the banks of the Mandakini river in his own form to ask for a sexual favour, which is flatly refused by Ahalya. Indra subsequently poses as Gautama and fulfils his objective.|$|E
50|$|Finally, at 12:45 on January 27 (about 30 {{hours after}} the first spark), <b>the</b> ship <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the Java Sea, along with 288 people in the lower decks.|$|R
50|$|Affected {{fish have}} pot-bellied appearance, haemorrhages on the fins and {{musculature}} and exopthalmos. Affected fish seem off balance {{and tend to}} swim erratically or close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface, eventually <b>sinking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom.|$|R
25|$|Brine is denser than {{seawater}} {{and therefore}} <b>sinks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ocean bottom and {{can damage the}} ecosystem. Careful reintroduction can minimize this problem. Typical ocean conditions allow for rapid dilution, thereby minimizing harm.|$|R

50|$|Modulation {{and heat}} {{dissipation}} techniques allow <b>the</b> building <b>to</b> store and dissipate heat gain through {{the transfer of}} heat from heat <b>sinks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> climate. This technique can {{be the result of}} thermal mass or natural cooling.|$|R
50|$|In Greek mythology, Acadine was {{a magical}} {{fountain}} {{described by the}} Greek historian Diodorus Siculus.

25|$|Not all {{anthropogenic}} artifacts {{placed in}} the oceans are harmful. Iron and concrete structures typically do little damage to the environment because they generally <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom and become immobile, and at shallow depths they can even provide scaffolding for artificial reefs. Ships and subway cars have been deliberately sunk for that purpose.|$|E
25|$|After another jet passes by, Nancy reminds Charlie {{about his}} {{childhood}} {{desire to live}} under the water.

50|$|A mud wall {{surrounds}} the modern town with more affluent residential areas lying outside the wall. The surrounding area consists of hill ranges of 9,000 feet (2,750 m) running northwest-southeast and <b>sinking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sistan {{depression in the}} south.|$|R
50|$|Donahue {{was also}} the subject of {{occasional}} controversy. In an episode dealing with transvestism, Donahue briefly wore a dress over his suit as a joke. Some critics complained that Donahue was <b>sinking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level of his more tasteless competitors.|$|R

25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} {{have a lower}} density than water, {{which means}} they are lighter and will form a separate layer on top of water. An important exception: most of the halogenated solvents like dichloromethane or chloroform will <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of a container, leaving water as the top layer. This {{is important to remember}} when partitioning compounds between solvents and water in a separatory funnel during chemical syntheses.|$|E
25|$|Some metals, such as nickel do not electrolyze out {{but remain}} in the {{electrolyte}} solution. These are then reduced by chemical reactions to refine the metal. Other metals, which during the processing of the target metal have been reduced but not deposited at the cathode, <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the electrolytic cell, where they form a substance referred to as anode sludge or anode slime. The metals in this sludge can be removed by standard pyrorefining methods.|$|E
25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} are flammable or highly flammable, {{depending on}} their volatility. Exceptions are some chlorinated solvents like dichloromethane and chloroform. Mixtures of solvent vapors and air can explode. Solvent vapors are heavier than air; they will <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom and can travel large distances nearly undiluted. Solvent vapors {{can also be found}} in supposedly empty drums and cans, posing a flash fire hazard; hence empty containers of volatile solvents should be stored open and upside down.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} heavily damaged by bombs, torpedoes and {{resulting}} explosions and fires, but the crew prevented her from capsizing by counter-flooding {{a number of}} compartments.
