[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 DALGA ENERJİSİ DÖNÜŞÜM SİSTEMİ TASARIMI VE DENEYSEL ÇALIŞMASI ÖZET Dünyanın enerji rezervleri gün geçtikçe tükenmeye yaklaşmaktadır. Bu doğrultuda enerji savaşları şiddetlenmekte, mevcut enerji yöntemleri ise zararlı etkilerini artırmaktadır. Fosil yakıtların tükenme eğilimine girmesiyle birlikte, enerji gereksiniminin karşılanmasında yeni arayışlar kaçınılmaz olarak ilerlemektedir. Nükleer enerji gibi alternatifler kullanım riskleri ve doğaya etkileri açısından bir takım problemler içermektedir. Yeni arayışlarda en iyi alternatif olarak rüzgar, dalga, güneş ışınları, hidrolik, biyomas ve jeotermal gibi yenilenebilir enerjiler ön plana çıkmaktadır. Yenilenebilir enerji kaynaklarından dalga enerjisi doğada yüksek potansiyelde var olmakla birlikte, günümüz şartlarında ekonomik değildir. Fakat, fosil kokenli yakıtların giderek tükenmesi, bu arada neden oldukları ağır çevre sorunları bu doğrultuda çalışmaların ilerlemesini zorunlu kılacak ve dalga enerjisi teknolojisindeki gelişmeler, dalga enerjisini de ekonomik hale getirecektir. Dünya üzerinde bir çok ülke dalga enerjisinden aktif olarak faydalanabilecekleri imkanlar ve yöntemler yaratmaya başlamışlardır. Dalga enerjisinden; cisim hareketini veya cisimdeki şekil değiştirmeyi kullanan sistemler, su basıncını kullanan sistemler ve hava basıncını kullanan sistemler olmak üzere temelde üç yöntemle elektrik enerjisi elde edilmektedir. Bu çalışmada; öncelikle dalga oluşumu, enerjisi ve dalga enerjisi tesisleri ile ilgili genel bilgiler aktarılacak, dünyanın ve Türkiye’nin bu teknolojide bulunduğu durum irdelenecektir. Devamında ise dalga enerjisini elektrik enerjisine çevirmek üzere tasarlanmış iki model üzerinde yapılmış deneysel çalışmalar ortaya konacaktır. Kullanılan sistemler temel olarak dalganın yarattığı düşey salınımları elektrik enerjisine çevirmeyi amaçlamaktadır. Buna göre iki sistem de silindirik plastik bir plakanın dalga etkisiyle düşey hareket yapması ve bu hareket enerjisinin elektrik enerjisine dönüşümü üzerine kuruludur. Birinci sistem elektrik üretimini dişlilere bağlanmış br dinamonun dairesel hareketiyle sağlarken, ikinci sistemde elektromanyetik bir sistem oluşturularak, bobin içerisinden geçen mıknatıslı çubuğun elektrik üretmesi denenmiştir. Deneyler sonucunda dişli sistemlerinin yük kayıplarını artırması neticesinde elektrik üretimi dikkate değer seviyeye ulaşamamıştır. İleriki çalışmalara örnek teşkil etmesi adına bu sistem de bu çalışmada detaylı olarak açıklanmıştır. Diğer sistemde ise elektrik üretimi sağlanmış ve verim değerleri tespit edilmiştir. Bu değerlerin elektrik üretiminin işlevsel olabilmesi adına artırımının sağlanması gerekmektedir. Bu doğrultuda yapılan deney, sistemde yapılacak olan zenginleştirmelerin ve malzeme seçimine dayalı bir takım düzenlemelerin sistemin gerçek üretim şartlarında sağlayacağı fayda hakkında fikir sahibi olunmasını sağlamıştır. A DESIGN AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON WAVE POWER CONVERSION SYSTEM SUMMARY Energy {{reserves}} {{on earth}} are getting closer to end day by day. As a result, energy wars are rising and {{the harmful effects of}} the current energy sources are leading earth to the end. Decrease in fossil fuels, inevitably, results with new searchs for new energy sources to fulfill energy need of human on earth. Alternative ways, like nuclear power are having problems due to the risk it promises about storage and environmental effects. Wind, hydroelectric, solar, biomass and wave powers seem to be the best match for an alternative solution to meet the energy need of world. Wave power, as one of these solutions, is having a high potential to use, however it is not economic enough yet. Till, the decrease of fossil fuels and negative effects of traditional energy sources on earth, push scientist to make researches in this way. Thus, new technologies and developments result with cheaper and easier usage of wave power. Wave power is generated from waves by three main methods: Motion of substance, motion and pressure of wave and pressure of air. In this study, wave features, occurance of wave energy and wave energy plants will be investigated and the conditions of wave energy productions in Turkey and in the world will be addressed. Also calculation of wave power and conditions effecting wave energy will be mentioned. Besides, two different designs of wave energy conversion systems will be observed with experimental studies. Both systems are basicly designed to evaluate vertical oscilation motions of waves into the electrical energy. To make this happen, a horizontal plane was used in both systems and that plane oscilates during the wave motion. That vertical motion of the plane creates a motion energy and different systems in two experiments try to convert that mechanical energy into electrical energy. First system conveys the mechanical energy to a dynamo via disk systems. System was designed to turn dynamo in the same way while round plate is both moving up and down. That option is designed to avoid energy loss during change in direction of dynamo. Second system is designed on the basic electromagnetic system principles. Like the first convertion system a steel rod passes through round panel to make it move in a linear direction. Vertical movement of round plate also moves a magnetic stick into a coil to create electrical energy. The pipe, placed on the roun panel is filled with 10 magnets an those magnets produce energy with the movement in both up and down directions. For both systems the electrical energy emerged is produced as alternative current. In this study, also current types and electrical information to calculate the amount of energy produced are mentioned. To determine the way to observe electrical energy and the power also, magnetic properties of materials and principles of electromagnetism were addressed. Especially for the second system electromagnetic properties and relations effect the amount of energy and the power of electricity. Both tests were applied in test channels in Istanbul Technical University Civil Engineering Faculty Hydraulics Laboratories. The channel having 24 m length, 1 m. width and 1 m. depth was used for tests. For both tests water level in the channel was kept at 60 cm. high. Waves were produced by a wave generator system, {{from the beginning of the}} channel. Wave energy convertion systems were placed in the middle of the channel to avoid effects of reflecting waves. Volt and Amper values produced by system was written down via AVOmeter placed on coil. All the test process was recorded by video camera and to read the change in AVOmeter records were watched in slowed motion. After obtaining volt and amper values, the diagrams for current and voltage changes were observed. By using the maximum values on that diagrams energy values of observ ed from the waves are calculated and noted down. To obtain regular and consistent values and decrease the risk factor of labour phase differences between voltage and current flow are ignored for all six wave conditions. Thus both volt and amper values were assumed to be obtained and generated at the same time. Although that will increase the value for all waves, this also keep the difference at the same level and provide consistency while comparing wave conditions. At the end of tests no substantial energy production was observed from first type system. The reason for that was noticed as the energy loss caused by the disk systems. Also weigth of the material used for producing round plate caused that loss of energy. To give an opinion for further researches, details of that first type wave energy convertion system is being included in this study. Changes in disk systems or material properties can make system effective for energy convertion. For second type wave energy convertion system, six types of waves were used for determining energy production. Waves used in the experiment were choosen from waves having different wave height and different wave periods. Maximum wave height was 14, 09 cm. and the minimum wave height was 10, 19 cm. Besides maximum wave period was 1, 40 sec. while minimum wave period was 0, 81 sec. At the end of tests, maximum power is obtained as 0, 110 Watt from the wave with 1, 01 sec. wave period and 13, 02 cm. wave height and minimum power obtained as 0, 047 Watt from the wave with 0, 81 sec. wave period and 10, 35 wave height. The maximum efficiency was obtained from the wave with 10, 19 cm wave height and 0, 81 sec. period as 0, 023. Also the wave from which the highest power obtained also worked with high efficiency comparing with others with the number of 0, 016. The lowest efficiency value was obtained from the waves with the wave height of 11, 33 cm. and 11, 38 cm. respectively. The period values of these waves are same and 1, 4 sec. for both. Comparing according to change in wave height, the highest current values are obtained as 15, 15 mA from the waves with 14, 09 cm wave height. The lowest current value is obtained as 9, 83 mA from the wave with the height of 10, 35 cm. Compared to change in the wave periods, the highest current values are obtained from the wave with the period of 1, 21 sec. and the lowest current value is obtained from the wave with the period of 0, 81 sec. Comparing according to change in wave steepness, the highest current value is obtained at the level 0, 062 as wave <b>steepness</b> <b>value</b> and the lowest current valu is obtained at the wave <b>steepness</b> <b>value</b> of 0, 10. Comparing according to change in wave height, the highest power produced is 0, 11 watt and obtained from the wave with the height of 13, 02 cm, besides the lowest power value is 0, 047 watt which is obtained from the wave with the height of 10, 35 cm. Comparing according to change in wave period, the highest power produced is obtained from the wave with the period of 1, 01 sec. and the lowest power value is obtained from the wave with the period of 0, 81 sec. Comparing according to change in wave steepness, the highest power produced is obtained from the wave with the <b>steepness</b> <b>value</b> of 0, 082 and the lowest power value is obtained from the wave with steepness of 0, 10. Those values showed that, optimum wave conditions are about having properties of 1 sec. Period time and about 13 cm wave height. These values also refer to wave steepness as 0, 1 for optimum value. Changes in the mechanism of the system and material properties can give different results for wave dimensions. Regarding these values, it is possible to improve system properties and test conditions. Thus, considering large device farms can provide useful amount of energy production. These changes for second system seem to be preferably made on coil and magnet structure and amount in first sight. Also thickness, shape and the material type of round panel is important parameter for both systems. Test results show that, in case of proper wave conditions obtained and device properties for those waves designed these two systems can be evaluated into a preferable energy convertion systems.

40|$|Methods {{to speed}} up {{learning}} in back propagation and to optimize the network architecture have been recently studied. This paper shows how adaptation of the steepness of the sigmoids during learning treats these two topics in a common framework. The adaptation of the steepness of the sigmoids is obtained by gradient descent. The resulting learning dynamics can be simulated by a standard network with fixed sigmoids and a learning rule whose main component is a gradient descent with adaptive learning parameters. A law linking variation on the weights to variation on the steepness of the sigmoids is discovered. Optimization of units is obtained by introducing a tendency to decay to zero in the <b>steepness</b> <b>values.</b> This decay corresponds to a decay of {{the sensitivity of the}} units. Units with low final sensitivity can be removed after a given transformation of the biases of the network.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{describe}} a preliminary meta-analysis of <b>steepness</b> <b>values</b> across several age-structured tuna assessments conducted under the world’s RFMOs. The key findings are that: A range of <b>values</b> of <b>steepness</b> are estimated across the world’s tuna stocks For some stocks steepness estimates from the Beverton-Holt curve {{were very close}} to the maximum of 1 and were associated with very tight [and presumably unrealistic] estimates of statistical uncertainty. This made it difficult to conduct a reasonable meta-analysis from the Beverton-Holt based estimates. The mode of the random effects distribution for steepness from the Ricker curve was 0. 80. This value was used in the reference case models for the 2011 WCPFC assessments of bigeye, yellowfin, and skipjack tuna. Further work is required towards meta-analysis of model outputs and the alternative approach to examining steepness through life history parameters may also yield useful results. In the interim I note the two key recommendations from the ISSF-funded workshop on steepness held in Rome, Italy earlier this year: The Workshop recommended that estimated <b>values</b> of <b>steepness</b> from individual assessments be treated with considerable caution. Analysts should evaluate {{the extent to which the}} stock-recruitment estimation or assumptions influence the estimates of recruitment; and The Workshop recommended that stock status advice incorporate stock assessment structural and parameter uncertainty including a range of plausible <b>steepness</b> <b>values...</b>|$|R

Coherently with a theoretical solution of the 2 D sloping case, the simulations evidenced (a) non—monotonic transverse profiles of the pressure head within the perched water, (b) slightly lower infiltration thresholds for perched water onset and for soil waterlogging, with respect to the 1 D case.

40|$|Abstract – Topographic {{attributes}} play {{a critical}} role in predicting erosion in models such as the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP). The effects of four different high resolution hillslope profiles were studied using four different DTM resolutions: 1 -m, 3 -m, 5 -m and 10 -m. The WEPP model used a common scenario encountered in the forest environment and the selected hillslope profiles to calculate the average annual runoff, average annual soil loss and average annual sediment delivery. The DTM resolution affects the slope steepness as well as the erosion and sediment delivery predicted by WEPP. The slope <b>steepness</b> <b>values</b> generated from higher resolution DTMs were less than from lower resolution DTMs. The trends in predicted average annual soil loss as a function of DTM resolution showed the same pattern as for slope steepness...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare the heave and pitch motions for the S 175 containership, {{travelling}} in head regular waves, obtained from the frequency domain linear and time domain partly nonlinear potential flow analyses. The frequency domain methods comprise the pulsating and the translating, pulsating Green's function methods, with the relevant source distribution over the mean wetted surface of the hull. The time domain method uses the radiation and diffraction potentials related to the mean wetted surface, implemented using Impulse Response Functions (IRF), whilst the incident wave and restoring actions are evaluated on the instantaneous wetted surface. The calculations are carried out for a range of Froude numbers, and in the case of the partly nonlinear method for different wave <b>steepness</b> <b>values.</b> Comparisons are made with available experimental measurements.

40|$|The natural {{mortality}} rate (M) of fish varies with size and age, {{although it is}} often assumed to be constant in stock assessments. Misspecification of M may bias important assessment quantities. We simulated fishery data, using an age-based population model, and then conducted stock assessments on the simulated data. Results were compared to known values. Misspecification of M had a negligible effect on the estimation of relative stock depletion; however, misspecification of M had a large effect on the estimation of parameters describing the stock recruitment relationship, age-specific selectivity, and catchability. If high M occurs in juvenile and old fish, but is misspecified in the assessment model, virgin biomass and catchability are often poorly estimated. In addition, stock recruitment relationships are often very difficult to estimate, and <b>steepness</b> <b>values</b> are commonly estimated at the upper bound (1. 0) and overfishing limits tend to be biased low. Natural mortality can be estimated in assessment models if M is constant across ages or if selectivity is asymptotic. However if M is higher in old fish and selectivity is dome-shaped, M and the selectivity cannot both be adequately estimated because of strong interactions between M and selectivity...|$|R
40|$|A {{discrete}} time {{model was}} developed to evaluate yield and spawning stock biomass-per-recruit and yield-per-unit-effort for a cohort of an idealized groundfish. This fish was characterized as relatively long lived (M = 0. 2), slow growing (K = 0. 2), with maximum length and weight of 100 cm and 10 kg, respectively, and 50 % maturity at a relatively early age of 3 years. The size selection characteristics of trawls and hooks were described by a logistic cumulative distribution function (LCDF) {{with a range of}} L 50 and <b>steepness</b> <b>values.</b> The size selection characteristics of gillnets and traps were described by a scaled normal probability density function (NPDF) with a range of values for Lopt and the standard deviation. Analysis of isopleth diagrams for yield-per-recruit (YPR) and spawning stock biomass-per-recruit (SPR) for both types of selection functions indicated that YPR is maximized when harvesting is directed on a fish length slightly larger than that at which biomass for the cohort of the unfished population is maximized, and at fishing mortality rates of 2 and greater. Under these harvesting conditions, SPR was between 24 and 36 % of the unfished condition. At these levels of fishing mortality and L 50, the steepness of the LCDF does not affect th...|$|R
40|$|Marine icing {{is a form}} of ice {{accretion}} that affects vessels in harsh environmental conditions. This type of {{ice accretion}} is primarily due to collision generated spray icing. Consequences of marine icing range in severity from capsizing of small fishing vessels to hazardous working conditions and reduced operational efficiency in larger vessels and rigs. The understanding of icing effects are mainly limited to atmospheric icing in the aircraft industry, while there is a limited amount of new literature and industrial knowledge regarding marine spray icing. The objective of this project was to understand the characteristics of collision generated spray at the lab scale. In this effort, experiments were conducted with three fabricated models of varying geometries in a tow tank that were subjected to oncoming waves. Wave probes measured the wave characteristics while pressure sensors and a high speed camera recorded impact pressure and spray generation imaging, respectively. The impact pressure and imaging data files largely serve as validation data for follow on research. Trends were observed and plotted that correlate increasing impact pressures with increasing wave <b>steepness</b> <b>values.</b> A qualitative summary of the spray characteristics captured through imaging found that higher instances of notable spray events occurred as wave impact pressure increased...|$|R
40|$|The {{identifiable}} {{pattern of}} the qualitative geomorphologic parameters such as <b>steepness</b> and concavity <b>values</b> that derived from the slope-area analysis of 28 tributaries in the San Gabriel Mountains were used to estimate relative rock uplift rates. The {{results suggest that the}} eastern region of the San Gabriel Mountain is controlled by a high rock uplift rate while the western region is controlled by a low rock uplift rate. Furthermore, arrangement of the variations of the <b>steepness</b> and concavity <b>values</b> suggests the presence of an active fault zone between the western and the eastern region of the San Gabriel Mountains. This tectonic zone is responsible for the apparent differentiation in rock uplift rates between the two mountain regions. This conclusion is supported from previous knowledge that suggests faster exhumation and high erosion rates of the East San Gabriel (ESG) block and slower exhumation and lower erosion rates of the Western San Gabriel (WSG) block (Spotila, J., Blythe, A., House, M., Niemi, N., Gregory, B., 2002). Moreover on the technological side of this project, plots of <b>steepness</b> or concavity <b>values</b> derived from analysis of SRTM (30 meter resolution), ASTER (30 meter resolution), USGS (30 meter resolution) and USGS (10 meter resolution) DEMs analysis suggest that USGS DEM- 10 meters and SRTM DEM- 30 meters are currently the most accurate methods to accurately quantify differential <b>steepness</b> and concavity <b>values</b> for the area of the San Gabriel Mountains in Southern California. Finally, the application of different smoothing options on the plots of slope-drainage area analysis of the tributaries of the San Gabriel Mountains suggests that a 600 meter window size is the optimum size with more reliable information and better noise elimination.

40|$|Calculations {{based on}} the mean values agreed to by the data {{workshop}} as the best estimates for life-history parameters produce <b>steepness</b> <b>values</b> less than 0. 2, the mathematical limit for that parameter. The only life history parameter estimated in the model is pup-survival; if the base case values for maturity, pup-production, and natural mortality at age- 1 + are not altered, then in order for steepness to be above 0. 2, pup survival must be> 0. 8 (or {{in the case of}} the Blacktip Gulf of Mexico model, pup survival must be> 0. 9). Considering that survival at age 1 was estimated to be in the range of 0. 7 - 0. 77 for these stocks, pup survivals of 0. 8 - 0. 9 may be unrealistically high. The minimum criterion for steepness can be achieved in any number of ways. For example, a greater number of pups produced per mature female, a much younger maturity ogive, or lower natural mortality for ages one and older—or any combination of these adjustments to maturity, mortality, and fecundity. Although there is a physical limit to the number of pups a pregnant female can carry, one could argue that increasing the number of pups to the upper limit or beyond permits the possibility that there are reproductive contributions from an unexploited/unsampled portion of the stock, o...|$|R
40|$|The {{updated version}} of the Spatial Multi-species Operating Model (SMOM) of krill-predatorfishery {{dynamics}} described in an accompanying paper is conditioned using the WG-SAM set of reference observations for Area 48 (the SAM calendar). Results are presented for two implementations of SMOM, one with the time series of krill abundance fixed on input, and the other incorporating an explicit model of krill dynamics. Additional versions of SMOM that {{may need to be}} conditioned are discussed. In general the two SMOM implementations are broadly successful in reproducing the direction and timing of observed changes in predator abundance. The main method of conditioning involved estimating a shape parameter (the “steepness”) of the predator-prey interaction formulation. The <b>steepness</b> <b>values</b> estimated suggest that penguins respond sooner than other predators to decreasing levels of krill abundance. Given data on fish catches, the model estimates the starting (1970) fish abundance level, with results suggesting that fish populations in several of the SSMUs are much reduced compared to their 1970 levels. The conditioned operating models presented here constitute a further step towards the development of a spatially-structured Management Procedure (MP) for the krill fishery by contributing to the set of such operating models to be used to simulation test candidate MPs for robust performance. The next step involves agreeing the relative plausibilities (weights) for the different operating models. An outline of suggested future steps in the MP development process is discussed...|$|R
40|$|While the Plio-Quaternary uplift of the Kazdag {{mountain}} range (Biga Peninsula, NW Turkey) is generally acknowledged, {{little is known}} about its detailed timing. Partly because of this lack of data, the cause of this uplift phase is also debated, being associated either to back-arc extension {{in the rear of the}} Hellenic subduction zone, to transpression along the northern edge of the west-moving Anatolian microplate, or to extension driven by gravitational collapse. Here, we perform a morphometric study of the fluvial landscape at the scale of the Biga Peninsula, coupling the recently developed R/SR analysis of the drainage network with concavity and steepness measures of a set of 29 rivers of all sizes. While the dependence of profile concavity on basin size confirms that the landscape of the peninsula is still in a transient state, the spatial distribution of profile <b>steepness</b> <b>values</b> characterized by higher values for streams flowing down from the Kazdag massif shows that the latter undergoes higher uplift rates than the rest of the peninsula. We obtain a SR value of 0. 324 ± 0. 035 that, according to the relation established by Demoulin (2012), yields an age range of 0. 5 – 1. 3 Ma and a most probable value of 0. 8 Ma for the time of the last tectonic perturbation in the region. In agreement with the analysis of knickpoint migration in a subset of rivers, this suggests that a pulse of uplift occurred at that time and, corroborated by sparse published observations in the Bayramiç and Çanakkale depressions, that the peninsula was uplifted as a whole from that time. This uplift pulse might have been caused by transient compressive conditions in the Anatolian plate when the Eratosthenes seamount came to subduct beneath the Cyprus arc around the early-to-mid Pleistocene transition (Schattner, 2010).

We compare the spatial patterns of both channel steepness index and cosmogenic 10 Be-determined erosion rates fromfour landscapes in Italy, where the geology and tectonics are well constrained, to four theoretical predictions of channel morphologies, which can be interpreted as the result of primarily tectonic or lithologic controls. These data indicate that longitudinal profile forms controlled by unsteady or nonuniform tectonics can be distinguished from those controlled by nonuniform lithologic resistance.

40|$|The {{study of}} stable, channelled, upland swamps is {{relatively}} new and the processes by which they attain and maintain stability are of particular interest. Channels can adjust three elements of their morphology: cross-section, bedform and planform. This thesis examines unusual extremes in the adjustment of these elements in several swamp channels at Barrington Tops, New South Wales. In these channels, high bank strength is afforded by dense vegetation that has enabled the channels to achieve unusually low width/depth ratios. The resultant at-a-station hydraulic geometry is such that width barely increases with flow stage, depth increases moderately and velocity increases markedly; the channels have particularly high hydraulic efficiencies. Shear stress calculations suggest that bankfull flows are more than capable of transporting the scant sediment {{with which they are}} supplied. This economic use of energy means that, to maintain equilibrium, the excess must be consumed by the remaining elements; bedform and planform. Bedform magnitude (steepness) is strongly linked to flow resistance and there are large variations in the scale of bedforms between the channels studied here. In the smaller but more sinuous Polblue Creek, power is moderate and bed features display moderate <b>steepness</b> <b>values.</b> In contrast, the larger but less sinuous Barrington River and Edwards Creek channels have higher stream powers and their armoured bedforms have developed with much greater steepness. The considerable turbulence associated with these larger features are unable to destabilise the highly resistant channel banks but are sufficient to generate energy losses that reduce grain shear-stresses and prevent bed erosion. Polblue Creek, Barrington River and Edwards Creek have each developed sinuous planforms, with some examples of very tight bends. The reduction in the energy slope associated with planform development and the substantial turbulence that these tight bends generate combine with bedform development to counter the exceptional hydraulic efficiency of the channel cross-sections. The development of extreme bedform and planform morphologies have enabled system stability, despite high shear stresses and limited energy expenditure on sediment transport. This research suggests that bed armouring, high bank strengths and the development of highly sinuous planforms are integral to the maintenance of channel equilibrium, as has been demonstrated by channelled-swamp stability over the last ~ 1 ka...|$|R

40|$|Situated in {{the area}} where the western end of the North Anatolian Fault Zone meets the extensional domain of the North Aegean Sea, the Kazdag Mountain range (Biga Peninsula, NW Turkey) is known to have {{undergone}} Plio-Quaternary uplift. However, no detailed chronology of this presumably ongoing uplift phase was so far available. In order to obtain a first-order estimate of the time of the last tectonic perturbation (uplift rate change) in the region, we performed a morphometric study of the fluvial landscape at the scale of the Biga Peninsula, coupling the recently developed R/SR analysis of the drainage network with concavity and steepness measures of a set of 29 rivers of all sizes. Defined as the ratio of two-by-two differences between hypsometric integrals describing respectively a catchment’s topography, its drainage network "composite profile" and the trunk stream profile, the R metric {{is a measure of the}} catchment’s incision response to a relative base level lowering. The SR index is then simply the slope of the regional relation R = f(ln A), a feature characteristic of the time elapsed since uplift caused an erosion wave to propagate in the drainage system. We obtained a SR value of 0. 324 ± 0. 035 that, according to the t = f(SR) relation established by Demoulin (2012), yields an age range of 0. 54 - 1. 29 Ma and a most probable value of 0. 82 Ma for the time of the last uplift signal in the Biga Peninsula. We also carried out an analysis of knickpoint migration in a subset of rivers, modelling their propagation by the stream power law under different assumed ages so as to compare the obtained values of the K coefficient with values mentioned in the literature. The positive results of this analysis, yielding realistic K values for ages around 0. 8 Ma, lend independent support to our morphometric estimate of the uplift time, moreover corroborated by published observations suggesting basin inversion of the Bayramiç and Çanakkale depressions at the same epoch. We relate this episode of increased uplift rate to the early-to-mid Pleistocene tectonic transition identified in the Eastern Mediterranean realm by Schattner (2010) and marked by a brief compressional episode. Finally, while the dependence of river profile concavity on basin size confirms that the landscape of the peninsula is still in a transient state, the spatial distribution of profile <b>steepness</b> <b>values</b> characterized by higher values for streams flowing down from the Kazdag massif shows that the latter undergoes higher uplift rates than the rest of the peninsula. This indicates that, after the regional Middle Pleistocene episode of accelerated uplift had come to an end, a local component of uplift persisted associated with either transpressive conditions along SW-trending segments of the North Anatolian Shear Zone or normal faulting along the southern border of the massif.

The quarter circle breakwater (QBW) is a recent type of breakwater developed on the lines of an earlier semicircular breakwater (SBW). QBW may be without perforations, seaside perforated or both sides perforated. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted in a two dimensional monochromatic wave flume on an emerged seaside perforated non-overtopping quarter circle breakwater model to study its stability against sliding. The scale of the model was 1 : 30.

A Praia das Rendeiras se localiza na porção central da laguna da conceição, ilha de Santa Catarina, estendendo-se no sentido leste-oeste ao longo de aproximadamente 2 km da margem. A praia é moldada pela ação de ondas, resultantes da atuação de ventos de norte/nordeste sobre o corpo lagunar, e sofre forte influência de estruturas antrópicas. O objetivo desse trabalho consistiu em identificar as características morfossedimentares da praia, dando uma maior ênfase à morfológica do banco {{marginal}} submerso associado à praia. A caracterização teve como base a coleta e processamento de dados batimétricos, sedimentológicos e de fotos de campo, além do cálculo da pista efetiva de vento (fetch) ao longo da praia. Os resultados mostraram uma forte heterogeneidade nas características morfológicas, tanto nas áreas emersas quanto nas áreas submersas. Os sedimentos se comportaram de forma mais homogênea, com tamanho de grão na classe areia fina, bem selecionada, para toda a praia. Os teores de carbonato biodetrítico se apresentaram maiores na porção central, e os teores de matéria orgânica total, nas extremidades. Os maiores valores de fetch encontrados coincidem com o setor de maior declividade e menor volume sedimentar. O setor com o maior desenvolvimento do pós-praia apresenta menor grau de exposição e mais de 50 % dos aportes pluviais existentes. Com base nos resultados foi possível identificar três setores morfologicamente distintos: oeste, central e leste. O grau de exposição e o fetch aumentam do extremo leste para o extremo oeste. A heterogeneidade ao longo da praia é controlada pelos seguintes fatores: orientação da linha de costa, morfologia lagunar, grau de exposição e influência de estruturas antrópicas. The Rendeiras {{beach is}} located in the central portion of Conceição Lagoon, Santa Catarina island, extending with a east-west orientation along approximately 2 km of the margin. The beach is molded by the action of incident waves, resulting from the performance of north/northeast winds on the water, indeed suffers strong influence of antrophogenic structures. The objective of this work consisted of identifying the morfosedimentary characteristics of the beach, with emphasis on the morphology of the marginal submerged bank associated with the beach. The characterization had as base the collection and geoprocessing of bathymetric, sedimentological and field pictures data, besides the calculation of the effective wind fetch along the beach. The results showed a strong heterogeneity in the morphologic characteristics, not only in the emerged but also in the submerged areas. The submerged area presents morphologic features such as transverse bars and mega ripples, with different morphologies depending on the place of occurence. The sediments behaved in a more homogeneous way, with grain size in the fine sand class, well sorted, for the whole beach. The major concentrations of biodetritical carbonate were found in the central portion, and the total organic matter, in the beach extremities. The largest values of fetch coincide with the largest steepness section and the smallest sedimentary volume. The most developed backshore presents a smaller exposure degree to the waves and wind and more than 50 % of the existent pluvial contributions. According to the results was possible to identify three sections with different morphological types: west, central and east. The exposure degree and fetch increase from {{the central part of the}} beach toward the extremities. The transverse bars orientation and <b>steepness</b> <b>values</b> suggest the existence of currents generated by waves in opposite directions, starting from the central section. The heterogeneity along the beach is controlled by the following factors: coast line orientation, lagoon morphology, exposure degree and antrophogenic structures influence...|$|R
40|$|Rock uplift rates can be diffi cult {{to measure}} over 103 – 105 yr time scales. If, however, a {{landscape}} approaches steady state, where hillslope erosion and rock uplift rates are steady and locally similar, {{then it should}} be possible to quantify rock uplift rates from hillslope erosion rates. Here, we test this prediction by comparing channel <b>steepness</b> index <b>values</b> and 10 Be catchment-averaged erosion rates to well-constrained rock uplift rates in two landscapes in Italy. The fi rst fi eld area is the Romagna Apennines, northern Italy, where rock uplift rates are relatively uniform, between 0. 2 and 0. 5 mm/yr (regional mean 0. 40 ± 0. 15 [SE] mm/yr), and have been steady since 0. 9 Ma. The second area is the region around northeastern Sicily and the southernmost Italian peninsula, where rock uplift rates are higher and exhibit a strong spatial gradient, from 0. 7 to 1. 6 mm/yr (regional mean 1. 09 ± 0. 13 [SE] mm/yr). In both regions, channel steepness indices and 10 Be erosion rates vary directly with rock uplift rates. Although there is considerable variability in erosion rates, regionally averaged rates in both the northern (0. 46 ± 0. 04 [SE] mm/yr) and southern (1. 21 ± 0. 24 [SE] mm/yr) areas accurately measure rock uplift rates. Although channel steepness indices do not quantify rock uplift rates, they are useful for (1) identifying regional patterns of rock uplift, (2) identifying areas where uplift rates might be expected to be uniform, and (3) informing 10 Be sampling strategies. This study demonstrates that, together, channel steepness and hillslope erosion rates can provide a powerful tool for determining rock uplift rates...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Breaking {{waves are}} {{critical}} to the exchange of momentum, gasses, and heat between the atmosphere and ocean. In open water, these exchanges control the growth and decay of waves, and have implications for global heat and gas budgets. However, local geophysical properties can significantly alter these exchanges. At river inlets, strong currents influence swell that has grown over a long ocean fetch, dramatically increasing surface fluxes. The reverse effect {{is seen in the}} presence of ice, where ocean wave properties are decoupled from atmospheric forcing, decreasing exchanges across the air/sea interface. Here, measurements of ocean waves and near surface turbulence are presented to show the modification of surface boundary processes from ice and currents. Measurements from free drifting buoys at the Mouth of the Columbia River are used to evaluate wave breaking parameterizations, where breaking occurs in intermediate depths and in the presence of vertically sheared currents. Breaking waves were identified using images collected with cameras onboard the buoys, and the breaking activity is well-correlated with wave steepness. Vertical shear in the currents produces a frequency-dependent effective current that modifies the linear dispersion relation. Accounting for these sheared currents in the wavenumber spectrum is essential in calculating the correct wave steepness; without this, wave steepness can be over (under) estimated on opposing (following) currents by up to 20 %. The observed bulk wave <b>steepness</b> <b>values</b> suggest a limiting value of 0. 4. The observed fraction of breaking waves is in good agreement with several existing models, each based on wave steepness. Further, a semi-spectral model designed for all depth regimes also compares favorably with measured breaking fractions. In this model, the majority of wave breaking is predicted to occur in the higher frequency bands (i. e., short waves). There is a residual dependance on directional spreading, in which wave breaking decreases with increasing directional spread. Observations at the Columbia River Mouth are also used to investigate the source and vertical structure of turbulence in the surface boundary layer. Turbulent velocity data collected onboard SWIFT buoys were corrected for platform motions to estimate turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and TKE dissipation rates. Both of these quantities are correlated with wave steepness, which has been previously shown to determine wave breaking within the same dataset. Estimates of the turbulent length scale increase linearly with distance from the free surface, and roughness lengths estimated from velocity statistics scale with significant wave height. The vertical decay of turbulence is consistent with a balance between vertical diffusion and dissipation. Below a critical depth, a power law scaling commonly applied in the literature works well to fit the data. Above this depth, an exponential scaling fits the data well. These results, which are in a surface-following reference frame, are reconciled with results from the literature in a fixed reference frame. A mapping between free-surface referenced and mean-surface reference coordinates suggests 30 % of the TKE is dissipated above the mean sea surface. Lastly, wind, wave, turbulence, and ice measurements from the Arctic Marginal Ice Zone are used to evaluate the response of the ocean surface to a given wind stress, with a focus on the local wind input to waves and subsequent ocean surface turbulence. Observations are from the Beaufort Sea in the summer and early fall of 2014, with fractional ice cover of up to 50 %. Observations showed strong damping and directional modification of short waves, which, in turn, decreased the wind energy input to waves. Near-surface turbulent dissipation rates were also greatly reduced in partial ice cover. The reductions in waves and turbulence were balanced, suggesting that a wind-wave equilibrium is maintained in the marginal ice zone, though at levels much less than in open water. These results suggest that air-sea interactions are suppressed in the marginal ice zone relative to open ocean conditions at a given wind forcing, and this may act as a feedback mechanism in expanding a persistent marginal ice zone throughout the Arctic...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Existing data {{reveal that}} the {{steepness}} S of many river basins with mountainous headwaters, defined as the ratio of total relief to total length of a basin, {{is related to the}} logarithm of basin size. The relief of these same river basins is observed to be non-linearly related to basin <b>steepness,</b> with maximal <b>values</b> of relief occurring in basins for which the value of S is about 0. 03 or, equivalently, in basins in which the average slope is about 2 °. These systematic relationships between size, relief, and steepness of some basins, which span nine orders of magnitude of area, are inter-preted in terms of an intermediate limit process bounded by well separated spatial scales. The lower-limiting scale corresponds to a threshold between channel formation and significant mass wastage, and the upper-limiting scale corresponds {{to the size of the}} largest landmass. If the observed relationships between basin size, relief, and steepness indeed reflect a limit process, then they are independent of the details of the physics contributing to landscape development and instead result from the constraints imposed by the bounding, spatial scales. Exceptions to the limiting relationships explored here are readily noted, however, and are interpreted to reflect regiona...|$|R
40|$|The Gulf of California and its {{surrounding}} land areas provide {{a classic example of}} recently rifted continental lithosphere. The recent tectonic history of eastern Baja California has been dominated by oblique rifting that began at ~ 12 Ma. Thus, extensional tectonics, bedrock lithology, long-term climatic changes, and evolving surface processes have controlled the tectono-geomorphological evolution of {{the eastern part of the}} peninsula since that time. In this study, digital elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) from Baja California were corrected and enhanced by replacing artifacts with real values that were derived using a series of geostatistical techniques. The next step was to generate accurate thematic geologic maps with high resolution (15 -m) for the entire eastern coast of Baja California. The main approach that we used to clearly represent all the lithological units in the investigated area was objectoriented classification based on fuzzy logic theory. The area of study was divided into twenty-two blocks; each was classified independently on the basis of its own defined membership function. Overall accuracies were 89. 6 %, indicating that this approach was highly recommended over the most conventional classification techniques. The third step of this study was to assess the factors that affected the geomorphologic development along the eastern side of Baja California, where thirty-four drainage basins were extracted from a 15 -m-resolution absolute digital elevation model (DEM). Thirty morphometric parameters were extracted; these parameters were then reduced using principal component analysis (PCA). Cluster analysis classification defined four major groups of basins. We extracted stream length-gradient indices, which highlight the differential rock uplift that has occurred along fault escarpments bounding the basins. Also, steepness and concavity indices were extracted for bedrock channels within the thirty-four drainage basins. The results were highly correlated with stream length-gradient indices for each basin. Nine basins, exhibiting <b>steepness</b> index <b>values</b> greater than 0. 07, indicated a strong tectonic signature and possible higher uplift rates in these basins. Further, our results indicated that drainage basins in the eastern rift province of Baja California could be classified according to the dominant geomorphologic controlling factors (i. e., faultcontrolled, lithology-controlled, or hybrid basins) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Hyporheic {{flow and}} surface waves {{can affect the}} solute {{transfer}} process in stream beds. A model described the solute transfer into a stream gravel bed with the hyporheic flow and standing wave was developed. Including the 2 -D flow field induced by standing wave and hyporheic flow, the 2 -D unsteady advection-dispersion mass transfer equation (ADE) has been solved numerically to obtain a time-variable 2 -D concentration field starting with zero solute in the stream bed. A Peclet number characterized the relative magnitude of advection to hydrodynamic dispersion and <b>steepness</b> ratio R <b>value</b> measured the relative roles of wave motion to hyporheic flow. The 2 -D concentration distributions were then averaged at each depth, and the resulting one-dimensional (1 -D) concentration profile with depth was matched to the solution of an unsteady 1 -D vertical dispersion equation. A depth-variable enhanced dispersion coefficient (DE) was thus determined by inverse modeling. The results demonstrate that the enhanced dispersion coefficient (DE) is the function of Peclet number and steepness ration and can be several orders of magnitude larger than the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient for large Peclet number (Pe> 100) and steepness ration (R> 1). For a given Peclet number, DE decreases often exponentially with depth. With an increase in Peclet number and steepness radio the solute also gains greater penetration into the stream bed. The penetration depth (dp) of the solute is therefore Peclet number and steepness radio dependent. “Closed-term ” relationships for the enhance dispersion coefficient (DE) and penetration depth are proposed...|$|R
40|$|When {{faced with}} a choice, humans and animals {{commonly}} distribute their behavior {{in proportion to the}} frequency of payoff of each option. Such behavior is referred to as matching and has been captured by the matching law.  However, matching is not a general law of economic choice. Matching in its strict sense seems to be specifically observed in tasks whose properties make matching an optimal or a near-optimal strategy.  We engaged monkeys in a foraging task in which matching was not the optimal strategy.  Over-matching the proportions of the mean offered reward magnitudes would yield more reward than matching, yet, surprisingly, the animals almost exactly matched them.  To gain insight into this phenomenon, we modeled the animals' decision-making using a mechanistic model. The model accounted for the animals' macroscopic and microscopic choice behavior. When the models' three parameters were not constrained to mimic the monkeys' behavior, the model over-matched the reward proportions and in doing so, harvested substantially more reward than the monkeys. This optimized model revealed a marked bottleneck in the monkeys' choice function that compares the value of the two options. The model featured a very steep value comparison function relative to that of the monkeys. The <b>steepness</b> of the <b>value</b> comparison function {{had a profound effect on}} the earned reward and on the level of matching.  We implemented this value comparison function through responses of simulated biological neurons.  We found that due to the presence of neural noise, steepening the value comparison requires an exponential increase in the number of value-coding neurons.  Matching may be a compromise between harvesting satisfactory reward and the high demands placed by neural noise on optimal neural computation...|$|R
40|$|The Nepalese Himalaya, one of {{the most}} active regions within the Himalayan Mountain belt, is {{characterized}} by a thick succession of Miocene age Siwalik sedimentary rocks deposited at its foreland basin. To date, much of its tectonic evolution, including exhumation in the Nepalese Siwalik, is poorly understood. This study of a quantitative analysis of the bedrock river parameters should provide crucial information regarding tectonic activities in the area. The study investigated geomorphic parameters of river longitudinal profiles from 54 watersheds within the Siwalik section of the Nepalese Himalaya, for the first time. A total of 140 bedrock rivers from these watersheds were selected using stream power-law function and 30 -meter resolution ASTER DEM. The quantitative data from the river longitudinal profiles were integrated with published exhumation ages. Results of this study show, first, a presence of major and minor knickpoints, with a total of 305 knickpoints identified, of which 180 were major knickpoints and the rest were minor knickpoints. Further classifications of knickpoints were based on structures (lineaments extracted from SRTM DEM), lithology, and possible uplift. Second, the Normalized <b>Steepness</b> index (ksn) <b>values</b> exhibited a range from 5. 3 to 140. 6. Third, the concavity index of streams in the study area ranged from as low as - 12. 1 to as high as 31. 1 and the values were consistently higher upstream of the knickpoints. Finally, integration of the river profile data with the published exhumation ages show that the regions with a high ksn value correspond to the regions with higher incision and, therefore, are likely to have high uplift. The presence of a break in ksn in the eastern section of the study area suggests that the incision is likely accelerated by Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) movements. Erosion of the thrust sheet could have influenced the rapid uplift of the Siwalik due to isostatic processes. Thus, the timing of the source-region exhumation and its rate suggests that MFT-related tectonics, and/or climate processes, likely influenced the landscape evolution of the study area. The results of this study should help in comprehending the neo-tectonic deformation of the Nepalese Himalaya...|$|R
40|$| rivers show a more {{rectilinear}} {{shape and}} the Ionian rivers show a less evident concave-up shape, in same cases {{close to the}} rectilinear, with evident knickpoints along the profiles. The Q (concavity index) values show a difference among the three sectors, with the Tyrrhenian rivers showing the highest value (Q= 0. 52), the Adriatic rivers showing a lower value (Q= 0. 45) and with the Ionian rivers showing the lowest value (Q= 0. 43). This data confirm what we noticed by {{the analysis of the}} river long profiles, in particular the Tyrrhenian rivers have a more evident concave-up shape and the Ionian rivers the less evident concave-up shape. The clear concave up shape of the Tyrrhenian rivers can be related to a more enhanced uplift on the Adriatic and Ionian slopes than on the Tyrrhenian slope. If we consider the Ks (<b>steepness</b> index) <b>values,</b> we suggest that in a geological setting such as the Southern Apennines, that is characterized by important lithological variations also in very close areas, the Ks index seems to reflect such variations more than recent rock uplift The geomorphological, morphometrical and sedimentological analysis of the Noce-Sirino-Alpi-Sant’Arcangelo transect allowed the individuation of two low relief landforms which are located on the western sector of the Sant’Arcangelo basin (700 - 900 m a. s. l.) and in the area between the north side of Mt. Sirino, Mt. Raparo and Mt. Alpi (1200 - 1400 m a. s. l.). The lowest surface (700 - 900 m a. s. l.) corresponds to the eroded depositional surface of the Serracorneta Conglomerate, so it is temporally constrained at about 0. 6 Ma. The morphological relationships among this lower paleosurface and the highest one are not clear, we can anyway affirm that it is recognized in the area north of the Mt. Sirino and it involves both carbonates units than Lagonegro Units, so its modelling took place after the exhumation of the Mt. Sirino ended and so, considering the data {{we are going to talk}} about soon, it could temporally constrained in the Middle-Late Lower Pleistocene, and in particular between 1. 5 - 0. 6 Ma. The field analysis let us to recognize the oldest units of the Qquaternary filling of the Sant’Arcangelo basin that contains clasts of the Lagonegro Units coming from the Mt. Sirino area: this unit is the subsynthem A 2 a (Benvenuti et al., 2006) which should be not older than 1. 5 Ma, so this means that at this time the Mt. Sirino was already a morphostructural highs that was experiencing erosion. This data agrees with the thermochronological analysis, which suggested that the rock exhumation of the Mt. Sirino started since 2. 5 Ma, and it has allowed us to give a lower temporal limit to the formation of the highest paleosurface. The analysis of the “map of the slope of the 1 st order channels”, carried out within the Sant’Arcangelo basin, suggests that the area comprised between the Serrapotamo and the Sarmento river shows the highest values: these high slope values could be related to a more enhanced uplift that this area has experienced respect to the rest of the Sant’Arcangelo basin. If we combine this data with the uplift data obtained by the analysis of the marine terraces on the Ionian coast (Amato, 2000), we have that the southwestern portion of the Sant’Arcangelo basin seems to be aligned with the southernmost Ionian coast, that is the portion of the Ionian coast which has experienced a more enhanced uplift: this data could suggest a connection between these two sectors, highlighting the presence of this NW-SE oriented portion of the Southern Apennines that has been strongly uplifted. The analysis of the river terraces inside the Sinni valley has allowed the individuation of 7 orders of river terraces. The highest order, the 7 th, doesn’t correspond to a real river terrace but it corresponds with the eroded depositional surface of the Serracorneta Conglomerates, whose age is of about 0. 6 Ma (Benvenuti et al., 2006). To date the lowest terraces we can try to correlate them with the dated marine terraces on the Ionian coast (Amato, 2000), this analysis let us to propose a late Upper Pleistocene for the 1 st order terraces of the Sinni valley Considering the age of the highest river terraces and the actual elevation of the Sinni valley it is also possible to establish an incision rate of about 1 mm/yr: the incision rate is always greater or equal to the uplift rate, so we can say that the uplift rate of the Sinni valley since 0. 6 Ma doesn’t exceed 1 mm/yr. This uplift rate agrees with the uplift rate that have been proposed by Amato (2000) for the marine terraces on the Ionian coast, where the author proposed an uplift rate comprised between 0. 3 - 1. 6 mm/yr. The analysis of the Noce valley river terraces has allowed the grouping of the several mapped fluvial terraces into three main orders: pre-lake, syn-lake and post-lake terraces. There are no absolute date available to date the lake time, so the age of the syn-lake terraces has been obtained using methods of relative chronology, by trying to correlate such terraces with dated marine terraces on the Tyrrhenian coast at the mouth of the Noce river: an Emilian-Sicilian age is proposed for the highest marine terraces at 170 m and 140 m a. s. l., while a Middle Pleistocene age is proposed for the 80 m a. s. l. marine terrace. The oldest marine terraces are extended inside the Noce valley, so it means that at that time the Noce valley was already individuated. In addiction to this we have to consider that, on the basis of morphometrical considerations, such marine terraces are correlable with the river terraces at about 200 m a. s. l. individuated in locality Feliceta, inside the Noce valley, and that are referred to the post-lake river terraces. Another important issue is given by the presence of Lagonegro clasts into this marine deposits and, considering that the only area from which these clasts could come from is Mt. Sirino, this data suggests that at the time of the formation of the oldest marine terraces (about 1 Ma), Mt. Sirino was already experiencing erosion, so it was very close to the actual morphostructural setting. The combination of the sedimentological data of the SAnt’Arcagenlo basin and the analysis of the Noce river terraces allowed us to affirm that about 1. 5 - 1 Ma Mt. Sirino was already a morphological high which was experiencing erosion, so it means that the rock exhumation processes was finished: the comparison of these data with the thermochronological data suggest that in the period between 2. 5 Ma and 1. 5 - 1 Ma Mt. Sirino has experienced an enhanced rock exhumation that has brought it from an initial situation where it was covered by about 4 km of rocks (2. 5 Ma) to a final situation where it outcrops on the Earth surface and it was subject to the exogenic processes (1. 5 - 1 Ma). This study has highlighted the importance of the morphotectonic approach in the reconstruction of the tectonic events occurred either at a regional scale or at a local scale. In particular, the numerical analysis of digital topographic data has been very useful to the large scale characterization of the Southern Apennines chain landscape. Furthermore, the integration of data provided by the digital analysis technique (e. g. swath profiles, river long profiles and the derived metrics), with the data obtained through the “classical” geomorphological approach, based on morphostructural and morphostratigraphical analyses, has provided new constraints to the reconstruction of the vertical motions which affected the entire chain during the Quaternary. The main results of this study can be summarized as follows: -	long profiles, elevation of the valley bottoms and the minimum elevation map show that the outer portion of the Southern Apennines (Adriatic and Ionian slopes) has been uplifted more recently and with higher rates than its inner side (Tyrrhenian slope). These data agree with data provided by the analysis of the shorelines, marine terraces and coastal deposits observed on the Ionian belt (Amato, 2000) and the Tyrrhenian margin (Romano, 1992; Caiazzo et al., 2006), which indicate that the Ionian flank has experienced larger uplift, since the Middle Pleistocene, than the Tyrrhenian flank; -	the Ionian rivers show a very steep long profile when they flow into the Sant’Arcangelo basin. This suggests that the post-orogenic uplift recognized by the marine terraces in the foredeep affected also the outer portion of the chain, involving at least the Sant’Arcangelo area; -	by the comparison of the Agri and the Sinni long profile, by the map of the gradient of the first order channel, and by the Ks values (which are higher on the southern portion of the Sant’Arcangelo basin and that decrease moving towards its northern portion) it appears that the uplift in the Sant’Arcangelo area follows a N-S trend. However, further studies are necessary to discern about the reason of such different uplift; -	as regards to the Middle Pleistocene to Present uplift trend, the above observations indicate that the uplift increases towards the west, probably reaching the chain axis. Coeval uplift in the Tyrrhenian margin (as estimated by elevation of Middle to Late Pleistocene marine terraces shorelines; Romano, 1992; Caiazzo et al., 2006; Filocamo, 2006) was much lower, not exceeding about 100 m. These evidences suggest that the uplift trend of the outer flank of the chain is not recognizable in the whole orogen. The western boundary of the more rapidly uplifting belt can be tentatively located in correspondence to the deep-seated normal faults that have formed the several Quaternary intramontane basins; -	the stronger post-orogenic uplift occurred on the outer side of the chain since the Middle Pleistocene has determined a minor ability of the Adriatic and Ionian rivers (which experienced a continuous downcutting) to compete with the Tyrrhenian rivers. This fact is enhanced by the comparison of the valley bottoms, which are higher for the rivers flowing on the outer flank than for the rivers flowing on the inner flank of the chain. This has probably contributed, together with regressive river erosion due to the extensional tectonics on the Tyrrhenian margin (see sec. 3. 5), in the decoupling between the maximum elevation line and the main divide, which is one of the peculiar features of the Southern Apennines chain; -	the combination of the field analysis together with the morphological and morphometrical analysis of the Noce-Sirino-Alpi-Sant’Arcangelo transect allowed us to affirm that during the late Lower Pleistocene Mt. Sirino was already a morphological high which was experiencing erosion, so it means that the rock exhumation processes was finished; -	this data is confirmed by the analysis of the river terraces of the Noce valley: the lacustrine conditions have been dated (by methods of relative chronology on the basis of the morphological relationships among the fluvial terraces of the Noce valley and dated marine terraces on the Tyrrhenian coast close to the Noce mouth) to the middle Lower Pleistocene, and the recognition of Lagonegro clasts inside the oldest marine deposits (Lower Pleistocene) suggests that at that time there was an active drainage from Mt. Sirino to the south, and so Mt. Sirino was already a morphological high subject to the erosional processes and able to produce debris, and the lake didn’t exist anymore; -	in addiction to this, we have to consider that since its exhumation, Mt. Sirino corresponds to the location of the Apennine divide, representing one of the few portion of the Southern Apennines where there is a coincidence between the maximum elevation line and the divide location. This situation is partly recognized also in Monti Pic...|$|R
