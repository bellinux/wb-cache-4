The proposed drive circuit of CCFL BLU consists of an inverter as a driving circuit and an equivalent circuit model for CCFL as a load of the inverter. It {{can be used to}} simulate the behaviors of CCFL BLU for various input waveforms using the standard circuit simulators, thus make the design process of an inverter simpler and easier. The equivalent circuit model for CCFL consists of nonlinear resistors and parasitic circuit elements. The nonlinear resistors were modeled after the measured DC current-voltage (I？V) characteristics of CCFLs. The coupling effects between CCFLs and between CCFL and the BLU frame were represented using the parasitic capacitances and inductances. For both pulsed and sinusoidal inputs, the voltage error between electrical simulation and measurement was less than 1. 3 % and the current error was less than 5. 8 %, which demonstrates that the proposed drive circuit model can be used to simulate the electrical behavior of CCFLs in LCD BLU accurately. The direct-linked single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC) was proposed as a highly efficient step up and <b>step</b> <b>down</b> <b>converter</b> to drive LED.

Therefore, the switching and conduction losses of switches and diodes, and winding resistive losses of inductors and equivalent series resistance losses of capacitors were reduced. The power delivery efficiency of the DLSEPIC (96. 7 %) is 5 % greater than that of the original SEPIC (91. 7 %).

Be it portable, stationary or motive applications, these batteries {{go hand in hand}} with battery charging systems. With energy harvesting being targeted in this day and age, high energy density and longer lasting batteries with efficient charging systems are being developed by companies and original equipment manufacturers. Whatever the application may be, rechargeable batteries, which deliver power to a load or system, have to be replenished or recharged once their energy is depleted. Battery charging systems must perform this replenishment by using very fast and efficient methods to extend battery life and to increase periods between charges. In this regard, they have to be versatile, efficient and user programmable to increase their applications in numerous battery powered systems. This is to reduce the cost of using different battery chargers for different types of battery powered applications and also to provide the convenience of rare battery replacement and extend the periods between charges. This thesis proposes a user programmable charging system that can charge a Lithium ion battery from three different input sources, i. e. a wall outlet, a universal serial bus (USB) and an energy harvesting system. The proposed charging system consists of three main building blocks, i. e. a pulse charger, a step down DC to DC converter and a switching network system, to extend the number of applications it can be used for.

40|$|Electrolytic {{capacitors}} {{are usually}} used in power electronic systems for smoothing, energy storage or filtering. They {{have the best}} overall performance for these objectives being a critical element {{in the design of}} these systems, in several applications, with different requirements. But, infortunately, in most cases, they are the most life-limiting device. The expected life of electrolytic capacitors depends on their internal temperature and is determined by the ratio of the electrolyte solution evaporation used in their fabrication. The deterioration caused by this evaporation is reflected in electrical parameters, mainly the equivalent series resistance (ESR). As the volume of the electrolyte decreases, ESR increases and capacitance decreases. Additionally, the increase in ESR has a positive feedback effect since it leads the temperature to increase and this in turn leads to further evaporation of the electrolyte leading to the ESR increase and so forth. This paper presents a simple ESR identification methodology for electrolytic capacitors condition monitoring in view of preventive maintenance to signal the need of maintenance and or replacement. The identification methodology is based on a simple continuous-time model and some recursive predictionerror methods, namely, Kalman filter, gradient and orgetting factor approaches.

40|$|Many {{applications}} {{benefit from}} using converters which can operate at high temperatures among them; down-hole drilling, hybrid vehicles and space craft. The theoretical performance of transistors made of Silicon Carbide (SiC) is investigated in this work. It is shown that their properties at high temperatures are superior compared to Silicon (Si) devices. Two half-bridge converters, using SiC normally-off Junction Field Effect Transistors (JFET) and SiC Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT), are designed and tested {{to verify the}} performance of SiC devices. The challenges which arise when replacing slow switching Si devices with extremely fast SiC transistors are thoroughly discussed. To fully utilize the properties of SiC transistors, the converter designer must pay extra attention to the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layout and component selection. For best device performance, all parasitics should be kept at a minimum. A high value of the Schottky diode capacitance results in voltage and current ringings, thus more ElectroMagnetic Interference (EMI) and switching energy loss. It is recommended selecting a Schottky diode with low junction capacitance as the freewheeling diode of the converter. Simulations and measurements show that the SiC transistors require special gate driving circuits to perform at their best. It is recommended to use a two-stage driver with high capability of charging and sinking gate/base currents. The JFET driver should also have a bipolar output to provide high noise immunity. The JFET is classified as a unipolar device; however {{the nature of the}} gate-source structure, which is a pn-junction, gives the device some bipolar characteristics. The gate structure is similar to BJT. To obtain a low on-state resistance some continuous gate current has to be provided. This is more pronounced at high temperatures. An analog control board, for operating the half-bridge as a <b>step</b> <b>down</b> <b>converter,</b> is designed and implemented. The controller uses current mode control to obtain a constant output voltage. Slope compensation is included to ensure stable operation at high duty-cycles. This makes the converter able to operate stably {{for a wide range of}} input voltages. The <b>step</b> <b>down</b> <b>converter</b> shows excellent performance during stationary operations and the ripple voltage is within its limit. When operating at high ambient temperatures it is important to have small transistor losses to minimize the self-heating of devices. The losses of a three phase inverter are calculated based on the measured conduction and switching losses of the SiC transistors. The calculations show that both inverters, based on BJTs and JFETs, are able to operate with very high efficiency even at high temperatures. High temperature characterization of the devices shows that their dynamic behavior, i. e. switching losses and switching times, are almost unaffected by temperature changes. The transistors, tested in this work, are suited to operate at ambient temperatures up to 150 &# 730;C. This is imposed by the conventional device packaging. Higher operating temperatures are achievable by using different packaging technologies, i. e. metal packaging advanced soldering methods. </p...|$|E

40|$|Conventional RF power {{amplifiers}} usually give their maximum efficiency near the maximum output power level. When the output power decreases, the efficiency drops sharply. Deep class AB or B PAs improve their efficiency by a self-adaptation {{of the current}} drawn from the power supply. However, in many cases, both deep class AB and B do not provide enough linearity like, for instance, in CDMA applications where spectral re-growth is of first concern. From class A to class B, RF PAs face the linearity-efficiency trade-off. The class A is linear but power inefficient, whereas class B is efficient but has a poor linearity. An alternative to the linearity-efficiency trade-off is to dynamically adapt the power supply voltage of a linear PA {{with respect to the}} instantaneous envelope value of the modulating signal. The linear PA is of class A or class AB and its collector or drain voltage is adapted to avoid RF output voltage to saturate such that, ideally, the linearity is not degraded. The supply voltage adaptation should be capable to follow large envelope bandwidth for CDMA application (3. 8 MHz for UMTS and 1. 2 MHz for IS- 95).

The purpose of this project was to design, build and evaluate a two quadrant step down DC/DC converter with CoolMOS transistors and silicon -carbide Schottky diodes as free wheeling diodes. Based on the results, conclusions will be made about the transistor topology’s suitability for a high power application, for instance in a hybrid vehicle.

From the simulation and measurements, the basic function of the two quadrant <b>step</b> <b>down</b> <b>converter</b> circuit is verified.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a simple variable speed drive (VSD) based on a brushless direct current (BLDC) machine and discrete logic circuits. A practical VSD was built, capable of operating a BLDC machine in two quadrants, motoring and regenerative braking. The intended applications are electric scooters and electric bicycles, where the recovered energy from braking extends {{the range of the}} vehicle. A conceptual four quadrant VSD, suitable for three and four wheelers requiring reverse operation, was designed and tested in simulation. Simplicity was emphasized in this design to help achieve a robust, easy to analyse system. The versatility of multi-function gate integrated circuits (ICs) made them ideal for implementing the commutation logic and keeping the system simple. The BLDC machine has sensors with a resolution of 60 ed to determine rotor position. An electronic commutator or phase switcher module interprets the position signals and produces a switching pattern. This effectively transforms the BLDC machine into a direct current (DC) brushed machine. A synchronous <b>step</b> <b>down</b> <b>converter</b> controls the BLDC machine current with a tolerance band scheme. This module treats the BLDC machine {{as if it was a}} DC machine. The leakage inductance of the electric machine is used as the inductive filter element. The unipolar switching scheme used ensures that current flows out of the battery only for motoring operation and into the battery only during regeneration. The current and torque are directly related in a DC brushed machine. The action of an electronic commutator or phase switcher creates that same relationship between torque and current in a BLDC machine. Torque control is achieved in the BLDC machine using a single channel current controller. The phase switcher current is monitored and used to control the duty ratio of the synchronous converter switches. Successful operation of the practical VSD was achieved in two quadrants: forwards motoring and forwards regenerating. The maximum tested power outputs were 236 W in motoring mode and 158 W in regenerating mode. The output torque could be smoothly controlled from a positive to a negative value. iv v Simulation of the conceptual four quadrant design was successful in all the motoring, generating and active braking zones. The required manipulation of logic signals to achieve this type of operation was done automatically while the machine was running. The resulting output torque is smoothly controlled in all of the operating zones. Commutation at certain speeds and torques are handled better by some topologies than others. Some current sensing strategies adversely affect instantaneous phase currents under certain conditions. The final design chose the method where phase currents experience no overshoot, minimizing component stress. The battery, or energy storage system, used in verifying the operation of the VSD in the practical electric bicycle was found to be the most limiting component. In regenerating mode, the low charge acceptance rate of the battery reduced the maximum retarding torque and energy recovery rate...|$|E
