25|$|The term sock puppet {{refers to}} {{multiple}} pseudonyms in {{use by the}} same person on a particular message board or forum. The analogy of a sock puppet is of a puppeteer holding up both hands and supplying dialogue to both puppets simultaneously. A typical use of a <b>sockpuppet</b> account is to agree with or debate another <b>sockpuppet</b> account belonging to the same person, {{for the purposes of}} reinforcing the puppeteer's position in an argument. Sock puppets are usually found when an IP address check is done on the accounts in forums.|$|E

25|$|Ars Technica {{reported}} that a series of 4chan discussion logs suggests that Twitter <b>sockpuppet</b> accounts were used to popularize the Gamergate hashtag. Heron, Belford, and Goker, analyzing the logs, said that early Gamergate IRC discussions focused on coordinating the harassment of Quinn by using astroturf campaigns to push attacks against her into mainstream view. They also describe how initial organizers deliberately attempted to cultivate a palpable narrative for public consumption while internally focusing on personal grudges against Quinn and aggressive sexual imagery. Mortensen wrote in Games and Culture that Gamergate's structure as an anonymous swarm allowed it {{to create an environment}} where anyone who criticized it or became its target was at risk, while allowing them to avoid individual responsibility for harassment.|$|E

40|$|In online {{discussion}} communities, {{users can}} interact and share information and opinions {{on a wide}} variety of topics. However, some users may create multiple identities, or <b>sockpuppets,</b> and engage in undesired behavior by deceiving others or manipulating discussions. In this work, we study sockpuppetry across nine discussion communities, and show that <b>sockpuppets</b> differ from ordinary users in terms of their posting behavior, linguistic traits, as well as social network structure. <b>Sockpuppets</b> tend to start fewer discussions, write shorter posts, use more personal pronouns such as "I", and have more clustered ego-networks. Further, pairs of <b>sockpuppets</b> controlled by the same individual are more likely to interact on the same discussion at the same time than pairs of ordinary users. Our analysis suggests a taxonomy of deceptive behavior in discussion communities. Pairs of <b>sockpuppets</b> can vary in their deceptiveness, i. e., whether they pretend to be different users, or their supportiveness, i. e., if they support arguments of other <b>sockpuppets</b> controlled by the same user. We apply these findings to a series of prediction tasks, notably, to identify whether a pair of accounts belongs to the same underlying user or not. Altogether, this work presents a data-driven view of deception in online discussion communities and paves the way towards the automatic detection of <b>sockpuppets.</b> Comment: 26 th International World Wide Web conference 2017 (WWW 2017...|$|R
5000|$|On October 21, 2013 the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) {{condemned}} paid advocacy <b>sockpuppeting</b> on Wikipedia and, on October 23, specifically banned editing by {{the public}} relations firm Wiki-PR. In August and September 2015 the WMF uncovered another group of <b>sockpuppets</b> known as Orangemoody.|$|R
2500|$|Because MetaFilter bans [...] "selflinks" [...] or {{posts by}} {{a person with a}} {{significant}} conflict of interest, posts tend to be scrutinized closely. Members of the site also have, several times, worked closely together to root out deception and scams. In May 2001, MetaFilter {{played a key role in}} uncovering the Kaycee Nicole hoax, in which a woman made up a fake online persona of a teenage daughter who was dying of cancer, fooling many bloggers and garnering sympathy and gifts. In October 2004, MetaFilter members uncovered the identities of the writers of the hoax Website Nick Nolte's Diary. An astroturfing campaign by Holden Karnofsky, the co-founder of the online charity GiveWell, was detected in January 2008 through a <b>sockpuppet</b> posting to Ask MetaFilter, leading to Karnofsky's resignation. In 2009, a user detected photoshopping by photographer Edgar Martins in a New York Times Magazine gallery, which was subsequently withdrawn.|$|E
50|$|The term now {{includes}} other misleading uses of online identities, {{such as those}} created to praise, defend or support a person or organization, to manipulate public opinion, or to circumvent a suspension or ban from a website. A {{significant difference between the}} use of a pseudonym {{and the creation of a}} <b>sockpuppet</b> is that the <b>sockpuppet</b> poses as an independent third-party unaffiliated with the puppeteer. Sockpuppets are unwelcome in many online communities and may be blocked.|$|E
50|$|On September 11, 2014, {{a number}} of <b>sockpuppet</b> {{accounts}} reported an explosion at a chemical plant in Louisiana. The reports came {{on a range of}} media, including Twitter and YouTube, but US authorities claimed the entire event to be a hoax. The information was determined by many to have originated with a Russian government-sponsored <b>sockpuppet</b> management office in Saint Petersburg, called the Internet Research Agency. Russia was again implicated by the US intelligence community in 2016 for using paid trolls in the US Election.|$|E

50|$|Another {{technique}} {{is the use}} of <b>sockpuppets,</b> where a single person creates multiple identities online to give the appearance of grassroots support. <b>Sockpuppets</b> may post positive reviews about a product, attack participants that criticize the organization, or post negative reviews and comments about competitors, under fake identities. Astroturfing businesses may pay staff {{based on the number of}} posts they make that are not flagged by moderators. Persona management software may be used so that each paid poster can manage five to seventy convincing online personas without getting them confused.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>sockpuppet</b> is {{an online}} {{identity}} used {{for purposes of}} deception.

50|$|In 2015, {{administrators of}} the English Wikipedia blocked 381 accounts, {{many of them}} {{suspected}} of being <b>sockpuppets</b> of the same people, after a two-month investigation launched by Wikipedia editors. More than 200 Wikipedia articles created from the accounts were deleted.|$|R

50|$|In 2012 Wikipedia {{launched}} one of {{its largest}} <b>sockpuppet</b> investigations, when editors reported suspicious activity suggesting 250 accounts {{had been used to}} engage in paid editing. Wikipedia traced the edits to a firm known as Wiki-PR, and the accounts were banned. In 2015, Operation Orangemoody uncovered another paid-editing scam, in which over 380 accounts were used to extort money from businesses to create and ostensibly protect promotional articles about them.|$|E
5000|$|On August 31, 2015, 381 <b>sockpuppet</b> {{accounts}} on the English Wikipedia {{were discovered}} operating a secret paid editing ring.

5000|$|A {{particular}} {{case is the}} Concern troll, a false flag pseudonym created by a user whose actual {{point of view is}} opposed to the one that the <b>sockpuppet</b> claims to hold.

The goal is to sow fear, uncertainty and doubt (aka FUD) within the group.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sockpuppets</b> may {{be created}} during an online poll to submit {{multiple}} votes {{in favor of}} the puppeteer. A related usage is the creation of multiple identities, each supporting the puppeteer's views in an argument, attempting to position the puppeteer as representing majority opinion and sideline opposition voices. In the abstract theory of social networks and reputation systems, this is known as a sybil attack.|$|R
50|$|In late 2007, GiveWell's founders {{promoted}} the organization on several internet blogs and forums using <b>sockpuppets</b> {{to ask questions}} about where to find good information about how to donate and then answering them, recommending GiveWell.
