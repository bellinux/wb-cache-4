2500|$|... (2007) Respirators' {{protection}} {{factor was}} measured under {{the conditions of}} exposure of workers with xylene and ethylbenzene vapors. Also, the team members conducted biomonitoring of exposure. They measured the concentration methylhippuric acid in the urine. Scientists have found a correlation between the concentrations of xylene in air and the concentrations of methylhippuric acid in the urine; and calculated the proportion of solvent entering the body through the lungs and through the skin. It turned out that if the respirator protection factors was more than 17-25, {{more than half of}} xylene enters to the painters' body through unprotected skin. The authors recommended the use of more hygienic methods of painting, since the use of <b>skin</b> <b>protection</b> continuously in hot tropical conditions difficult to achieve.|$|E
2500|$|Similar {{structure}} but not fluorescent, germicidal lamps {{depend on}} the property that spectrum of 254nm kills most germs. Germicidal lamps contain no phosphor at all (making them mercury vapor gas discharge lamps rather than fluorescent) and their tubes are made of fused quartz that is transparent to the UV light emitted by the mercury discharge. The 254nm UV emitted by these tubes will kill germs and ionize oxygen to ozone. In addition it can cause eye and skin damage {{and should not be}} used or observed without eye and <b>skin</b> <b>protection.</b> Besides their uses to kill germs and create ozone, they are sometimes used by geologists to identify certain species of minerals by the color of their fluorescence. When used in this fashion, they are fitted with filters {{in the same way as}} blacklight-blue lamps are; the filter passes the short-wave UV and blocks the visible light produced by the mercury discharge. They are also used in some EPROM erasers. Germicidal lamps have designations beginning with G (meaning germicidal), rather than F, for example G30T8 for a 30-watt, [...] diameter, [...] long germicidal lamp (as opposed to an F30T8, which would be the fluorescent lamp of the same size and rating).|$|E

40|$|Rationale Globally, the {{prevalence}} of atopic diseases continues to rise. Up to 20 % {{of the population is}} thought to be affected, exerting enormous health, social and financial burdens. Emerging data suggests atopic dermatitis precedes allergic sensitization and may increase the predisposition to food allergy, allergic rhinitis and asthma later in life. Pilot testing has suggested infant <b>skin</b> barrier <b>protection</b> may reduce the risk of atopic dermatitis. Parallel research has suggested exposure to phthalates may be driving the inflammatory process at the dermal level.   Methods The altered skin barrier and hapten-atopy hypotheses are summarized. A schema for a pragmatically designed, randomized controlled trial is developed to address: 1. Does <b>skin</b> barrier <b>protection</b> using an occlusive moisturizer and measures to reduce phthalate exposure among infants reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis and {{the prevalence}} of atopic diseases, and 2. If so, do these interventions reduce risk in an additive or synergistic manner?   Results Population based recruitment of newborn infants to one of three interventions or a control arm is proposed. The first arm would involve the application of an occlusive skin moisturizer to protect skin barrier integrity; the second, measures to reduce dietary and environmental phthalate exposures and the third would add <b>skin</b> barrier <b>protection</b> to the phthalate exposure reduction protocol. The protocol phase would ideally continue for three years, while the observation phase for the detection of disease incidence and prevalence would span 18 years. Recommendations for data interpretation include regression analysis for modeling the intervention effects on other environmental and dietary exposures thought to increase the risk of atopic diseases.   Conclusions Pragmatic design would optimize the generalizability of the results. Study findings would clarify public health approaches for atopic disease prevention by broadening the current understanding of the effects of phthalates on child health and by informing best practices for infant skin care...|$|R

50|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to 1-bromopropane typically occurs through breathing or skin contact; it is easily {{absorbed into the}} blood via the skin.

50|$|Photoreceptors, {{similar to}} those found in the retina of the eye, detect {{potentially}} damaging ultraviolet radiation (ultraviolet A specifically), inducing increased production of melanin by melanocytes.

However, whether this offers protection is debatable, because the amount of melanin released by this process is modest in comparison to the amounts released in response to DNA damage caused by ultraviolet B radiation.|$|R

50|$|Excessive UV {{radiation}} {{is the leading}} cause of primarily non-malignant skin tumors. Sunscreen is widely agreed to prevent sunburn and some types of skin cancer. Clothing, including hats, is considered the preferred <b>skin</b> <b>protection</b> method. Moderate sun tanning without burning can also prevent subsequent sunburn, as it increases the amount of melanin, a photoprotective pigment that is the skin's natural defense against overexposure. Importantly, both sunburn and the increase in melanin production are triggered by direct DNA damage. When the skin cells' DNA is overly damaged by UV radiation, type I cell-death is triggered and the skin is replaced.|$|E
