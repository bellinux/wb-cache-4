25|$|In June 2013 a World Fire Safety Foundation report titled, 'Can Australian and U.S. <b>Smoke</b> <b>Alarm</b> Standards be Trusted?' was {{published}} in the official magazine of the Australian Volunteer Fire Fighter's Association. The report brings into question the validity of testing criteria used by American and Australian government agencies when undergoing scientific testing of ionization smoke alarms in smoldering fires.|$|E
25|$|In the Australian State of Queensland, from 1 January 2017 all smoke alarms in new {{dwellings}} (or where {{a dwelling}} is substantially renovated) must be photoelectric, not also contain an ionisation sensor, be hardwired to the {{mains power supply}} with a secondary power source (i.e. battery) and be interconnected with every other <b>smoke</b> <b>alarm</b> in the dwelling so all activate together.|$|E
50|$|<b>Smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> - <b>Smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> {{also known}} as smoke detectors, {{generally}} sound an audible and visual <b>alarm.</b> <b>Smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> are usually housed in a disk-shaped plastic enclosure about 6 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick and are often powered by a disposable battery.|$|R
40|$|Primary care {{physicians}} interested in health education and accident prevention should be knowledgeable about <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> (<b>smoke</b> detectors with built-in alarms).

25|$|In June 2014, tests by the North Eastern Ohio Fire Prevention Association (NEOFPA) on {{residential}} <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> were {{broadcast on}} the ABC's 'Good Morning America' program. The NEOFPA tests showed ionization <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> failing to activate in the early, smoldering stage of fire. The combination ionization-photoelectric alarms failed to activate until {{an average of}} over 20 minutes after the stand-alone photoelectric <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms.</b> This vindicated the June 2006 official position of the Australasian Fire & Emergency Service Authorities Council (AFAC) and the October 2008, official position of the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF). Both AFAC and the IAFF recommend photoelectric <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms,</b> but not combination ionization/photoelectric <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms.</b>|$|R
25|$|Smaller, less expensive, <b>smoke</b> <b>alarm</b> systems, {{typically}} {{used in a}} domestic/residential environment, may be individual standalone units, or interconnected. They typically generate a loud acoustic warning signal as their only action. Several detectors (whether standalone or interconnected) are normally used in the rooms of a dwelling. There are inexpensive smoke alarms that may be interconnected so that any detector that triggers sounds all alarms. They are powered by mains electricity, with disposable or rechargeable battery backup. They may be interconnected by wires, or wirelessly.They are required in new installations in some jurisdictions.|$|E
25|$|Batteries {{are used}} either as sole or as backup power for {{residential}} smoke detectors. Mains-operated detectors have disposable or rechargeable batteries; others run only on 9-volt disposable batteries. When the battery is exhausted a battery-only smoke detector becomes inactive; most smoke detectors chirp repeatedly if the battery is low. It {{has been found}} that battery-powered smoke detectors in many houses have dead batteries. It has been estimated that in the UK over 30% of smoke alarms may have dead or removed batteries. In response public information campaigns have been created to remind people to change smoke detector batteries regularly. In Australia, for example, a public information campaign suggests that <b>smoke</b> <b>alarm</b> batteries should be replaced on April Fools' Day every year. In regions using daylight saving time, campaigns may suggest that people change their batteries when they change their clocks or on a birthday.|$|E
25|$|The first single-station smoke {{detector}} {{was invented in}} 1970 and made public the next year. It was an ionization detector powered by a single 9-volt battery. They cost about US$125 and sold {{at a rate of}} a few hundred thousand per year. Several technological developments occurred between 1971 and 1976, including the replacement of cold-cathode tubes with solid-state electronics, which greatly reduced the detectors' sizes and made it possible to monitor battery life. The previous alarm horns, which required specialty batteries, were replaced with horns that were more energy-efficient, enabling the use of commonly available sizes of batteries. These detectors could also function with smaller amounts of radioactive source material, and the sensing chamber and {{smoke detector}} enclosure were redesigned for more effective operation. The rechargeable batteries were often replaced by a pair of AA batteries along with a plastic shell encasing the detector. The 10-year-lithium-battery-powered <b>smoke</b> <b>alarm</b> was introduced in 1995.|$|E
40|$|<b>Smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> are small, {{self-contained}} electrical {{units that}} signal an alarm warning when detecting {{the presence of}} smoke or fire. <b>Smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> may be hard wired into a building, and powered by a replaceable battery, {{or a combination of}} the two.

40|$|The time {{of smoke}} {{detection}} and loudness of the alarm sound received by occupants largely determine {{the effectiveness of}} <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> in dwellings. This paper reports on research that measured both of these for <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> in the room of fire origin, hallways and in other rooms to help determine the benefits of <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> in rooms rather than hallways, in more rooms than currently required, and interconnected rather than unconnected alarms. The results demonstrated significant benefits would be obtained with interconnected alarms in all rooms – on average much faster detection and much more effective warning, particularly for “at risk” people. It is expected that adoption of interconnected <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> in all rooms of dwellings would result in significantly reduced fire fatalities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} the findings from projects at SINTEF NBL concerning the human safety aspect in fires, focusing on fire safety in domestic houses. How domestic <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> affect the safety is chosen as a term of reference. Results from statistical surveys of fire deaths in Norway compared with other countries are used to describe who dies in fires. The use of and requirements for domestic <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> {{in different parts of the}} world is briefly presented. The sensibility of ionic and optical smoke detectors in smouldering and flaming fires are analyzed, and an evaluation of the effectiveness of the two detector principles is made based on the test results and expected frequencies of these types of fires. Available time for evacuation is discussed based on expected time to untenable conditions, expected time to flashover, expected time to intervention from fire brigades, and the expected response time for <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms.</b> Different needs to evacuate different groups of occupants (children, elderly people, disabled) are also discussed. An analysis shows that the Norwegian requirement of domestic <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms</b> is highly cost effective. In Norway between 40 and 60 people die in fires every year, and it is estimated that 10 lives is saved every year because of installed domestic <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms.</b> There is, however, an improvement potential for the effectiveness of domestic <b>smoke</b> <b>alarms.</b> Detector...|$|R
25|$|Flight day 6 was {{dedicated}} to transferring supplies from the MPLM Leonardo and the space shuttle mid-deck. The crews transferred the Windows Observational Research Facility (WORF) to the Destiny lab. Mission specialist Naoko Yamazaki, along with flight engineer Soichi Noguchi also transferred the Express Rack 7 (ER7) to its final location. During the crews morning, a <b>smoke</b> <b>alarm</b> sounded in the Russian segment of the station, which prompted the joint crew to move into emergency procedures. However the alarm was false and was cleared {{within a couple of}} minutes and all normal work resumed. Mission specialists Clay Anderson, Rick Mastracchio and Stephanie Wilson conducted in-flight interviews with Nebraska Public Radio, CBS Newspath and Radio Network and KETV-TV in Omaha, Nebraska. Later in the day commander Alan Poindexter, pilot Jim Dutton and mission specialist Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger talked with students at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. At the end of the crews work day, the joint crew got together and reviewed the procedures for the second spacewalk. After the procedures review spacewalkers Clay Anderson and Rick Mastracchio entered the Quest airlock, closed the hatch and lowered the inside pressure to 10.2 psi. The pair also breathed pure oxygen for an hour while the pressure was being lowered.|$|E
25|$|Survivors {{are armed}} with various firearms. Each player starts {{the game with}} a semiautomatic pistol. It may be reloaded an {{unlimited}} number of times and is the only weapon that the survivor can use when they are incapacitated. When a second pistol is found, the player can dual wield them, also with unlimited ammo. At the beginning of each campaign, the player can choose between a submachine gun and a pump-action shotgun. As the survivors progress through a campaign, more powerful weapons can be found: the fully automatic assault rifle (an upgrade to the submachine gun), a semi-automatic shotgun (an upgrade to the pump-action shotgun), and a scoped hunting rifle. A flashlight that can be toggled on and off is mounted on each firearm, with the exception of additional pistols. In addition to firearms, a player can also carry three other items in their inventory: improvised grenades (either a Molotov cocktail or a pipe bomb modified with an attached <b>smoke</b> <b>alarm</b> designed to attract the infected to it before it explodes); a first aid kit, which can be used to heal any survivor and pain pills, which provide temporary health that depletes gradually and quicker with damage from infected, and can be handed to teammates for later use. Regardless of what weapon or item a player is using, a melee attack can be used to shove away any infected within reach. Also available are environmental weapons, such as gas cans, propane cylinders, and oxygen tanks, all of which explode when shot. These environmental weapons can be picked up, moved, and used as a melee weapon by the survivors, but while carrying an object they cannot use their weapons or health items. Strategically placed minigun turrets are also encountered at various locations throughout the different maps.|$|E

Shortly after he leaves, Kristen realizes the chimney flue is closed, and attempts to open it; while she does this, smoke emanating from the fire triggers a <b>smoke</b> <b>alarm.</b> Kristen attempts to disarm the <b>smoke</b> <b>alarm</b> when she is startled by another knock at the door; she drops the alarm on the floor and retreats to the bedroom, unnerved. She calls James' cellphone from the landline, but their call is cut short.

[...] This aspect of the program brought about strong opposition at the local suburban level and lost support in the White House as well. [...] Over half of HUD's research funds during this time were spent on Operation Breakthrough, and it was modestly successful in its building goals.

2500|$|In the United States, {{the first}} {{standard}} for home smoke alarms, NFPA 74, {{was established in}} 1967. In 1969, the AEC allowed homeowners to use smoke detectors without a license. The Life Safety Code (NFPA 101), passed by the National Fire Protection Association in 1976, first required smoke alarms in homes. <b>Smoke</b> <b>alarm</b> sensitivity requirements in UL 217 were modified in 1985 to reduce susceptibility to nuisance alarms. In 1988 BOCA, ICBO, and SBCCI model building codes begin requiring smoke alarms to be interconnected and located in all sleeping rooms. In 1989 NFPA 74 first required smoke alarms to be interconnected in every new home construction, and in 1993 NFPA 72 first required that smoke alarms be placed in all bedrooms.
