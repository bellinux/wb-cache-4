To capture system performance over time, a new metric, the average estimation error variance (AEV), is proposed. For a system that has N sensors with equal measurement noise variance, numerical results show that the optimal <b>staggering</b> <b>pattern</b> is to use N uniformly staggered sensors. We have also shown analytically that the AEV of the system with N uniformly staggered sensors is always smaller than that of the system with N synchronous sensors. For sensors with different measurement noise variances, the optimal <b>staggering</b> <b>pattern</b> can be found numerically. Practical guidelines on selecting the optimal <b>staggering</b> <b>pattern</b> have been presented for different target tracking scenarios. Due to its simplicity, uniform staggering can be used as an alternative scheme with relatively small performance degradation...|$|R

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that the odd-even staggering (OES) in the γ- bands of heavy deformed nuclei can be reasonably characterized by a discrete approximation of the fourth derivative of the odd-even energy difference {{as a function of}} angular momentum L. This quantity exhibits a well developed <b>staggering</b> <b>pattern</b> (zigzagging behavior with alternating signs) in rare earth nuclei and actinides with long γ- bands (L≥ 10). It is shown that the OES can be interpreted reasonably {{as the result of the}} interaction of the γ band with the ground band in the framework of a Vector Boson Model with SU(3) dynamical symmetry. The model energy expression reproduces successfully the <b>staggering</b> <b>pattern</b> in all considered nuclei up to L= 12 - 13. The general behavior of the OES effect in rotational regions is studied in terms of the ground [...] γ band-mixing interaction, showing that strong OES effect occurs in regions with strong ground [...] γ band-mixing interaction. The approach used allows a detailed comparison of the OES in γ bands with the other kinds of staggering effects in nuclei and diatomic molecules. Comment: 25 pages, 11 postscript figure...|$|R

50|$|The basic {{construction}} method {{begins by}} digging a trench down to undisturbed mineral subsoil. Rows of woven bags (or tubes) {{are filled with}} available material, placed into this trench, compacted with a pounder to around 1/3 thickness of pre-pounded thickness, and form a foundation. Each successive layer will have one or more strands of barbed wire placed on top. This digs into the bag's weave and prevents slippage of subsequent layers, and also resists any tendency for the outward expansion of walls. The next row of bags is offset by half a bag's width to form a <b>staggered</b> <b>pattern.</b> These are either pre-filled with material and delivered, or filled in place (often the case with Superadobe). The weight of this earth-filled bag pushes down on the barbed wire strands, locking the bag in place on the row below. The same process continues layer upon layer, forming walls. A roof can be formed by gradually sloping the walls inward to construct a dome. Traditional types of roof can also be made.|$|E

The order of the real and imaginary parts staggering is reversed on their adjacent subchannels. The I/Q <b>staggering</b> <b>pattern</b> shown in Figure  2 applies for this case.

50|$|In disc brakes, {{there are}} usually two brake pads per disc rotor. These are held in place and {{actuated}} by a caliper affixed to the wheel hub or suspension upright. Most vehicles have two brake pads per caliper. However racing calipers can utilize up to six pads, with varying frictional properties in a <b>staggered</b> <b>pattern</b> for optimum performance.Depending on {{the properties of the}} material, disc wear rates may vary. The brake pads must usually be replaced regularly (depending on pad material) to prevent brake fade. Most brake pads are equipped with a method of alerting the driver when this needs to be done. A common technique is manufacturing a small central groove whose eventual disappearance by wear indicates the end of a pad's service life. Others methods include placing a thin strip of soft metal in a groove, such that when exposed (due to wear) the brakes squeal audibly and embedding a soft metal tab in the pad material that closes an electric circuit and lights a dashboard warning light when the brake pad wears thin.|$|E
50|$|To {{assemble}} the ZMC-2 a skin-riveting machine {{was developed by}} the Aviation Tool Co., a division of the Detroit Aircraft Corporation. The device was invented by Edward J. Hill, who had come to work on the ZMC-2 after leaving the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The machine consisted of an aluminum casting, weighing about 100 pounds, and was supported on springs from a framework that ran on concentric circular rails set into the floor of the hangar. There were two sets of circular rails, one {{at each end of the}} building. Three riveting machines were made, one for each set of tracks, and one for reserve when repairs might be needed. The reason for two sets of tracks was that the hull was built in two sections, front and rear. Each end started from a circular plate suspended from the hangar roof by a cable and free to rotate as each 18 inch wide strip Alclad was added. In this manner, each end of the ship slowly grew as succeeding rows were added, looking like a bulls eye at first and later like a huge inverted teacup. Both sections were under construction continuously 24 hours a day, seven days a week, once the hull was started. The riveting machine fed three small aluminum wires from large spools to make a seam about a quarter inch wide composed of three rivets, one above the other in a <b>staggered</b> <b>pattern.</b> In theory the machine could sew about 50 feet of seam in an hour, but in practice about 10 or more feet was the average. The sheets of Alclad used were eight to nine thousandths of an inch thick. As the each section of the hull grew internal annular rings were added at appropriate distances to give stiffness and reinforcement to the hull skin. In addition, lightweight longitudinal channels were added between the circular rings, giving the internal structure the appearance of a huge bird cage. The helium gas was contained by the hull only, no fabric was used to contain the helium. Inside the hull were two large airbag cells, called ballonets, made of rubberized fabric and containing air. These cells could be expanded or contracted to control pressure as the helium expanded or contracted with the heating or cooling of the atmosphere or to adapt to changes of atmospheric pressure with altitude, and to control fore and aft trim. In operation the ZMC-2 was susceptible to heating and cooling effects of the sun causing it to pop and buckle in the evenings if pressure from blowers was not applied. During its service life the ZMC-2 was found to have a gas diffusion rate much lower than that of fabric-hulled blimps, meaning that a much longer time would pass before additional helium needed to be added.|$|E

The frequency-domain model of TSVs is extracted in S-parameter from a 3 D electromagnetic (EM) method, where the dimensional variation effect of TSVs can be accurately considered for a comprehensive parameter sweep simulation. A parametric analysis shows that the propagation delay increases with the diameter and height of the TSVs but decreases with the pitch and liner thickness.

Methane air premixed flame of Reynolds number varying from 50 to 600 and an equivalence ratio varying from 0. 6 to 1. 2 is considered. The hole to impingement plate distance is varied from 3 to 7.
