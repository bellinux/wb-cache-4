Altogether, another fifteen Ranger companies would be formed in 1950 and 1951, and <b>six</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> would see combat in Korea.|$|E

It {{was also one of the}} first computers, if not the first, to have floating point arithmetic. Meg operated for the first time in 1954, and nineteen were sold by Ferranti, <b>six</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> to customers overseas.|$|E
