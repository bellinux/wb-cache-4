40|$|Abstract. Magnesium {{die-casting}} {{has experienced}} dramatic {{growth over the}} past decade and the recycling of magnesium scrap has become increasingly important due to the generation of substantial quantities of scrap in the die-casting process. Magnesium is a readily recyclable material and the recycling of magnesium scrap is crucial in making magnesium more competitive.

40|$|Abstract. High {{pressure}} die-casting (HPDC) is {{a widely}} used production technique for metal components that are required to have close dimensional tolerances and smooth surface finishes. Approximately 50 % of the aluminium castings produced globally are manufactured by HPDC from <b>secondary</b> <b>alloy</b> and these are dominant in the automotive sector where they account {{for the majority of}} aluminium components present in each vehicle manufactured.

These processes may significantly improve the properties which develop from the alloys, thereby significantly increasing the scope of applications that may be realized. HPDC alloys however have not been developed specifically for heat treatment or the optimization of specific properties. In particular, recent work in Al-Si-Cu HPDC alloys has identified composition ranges of alloys for a) achieving yield strengths exceeding 400 MPa, b), rapid heat treatment that minimizes cost / cycle times, and c) high strength combined with elevated ductility levels.

40|$|The {{effects of}} AlTi 5 B 1 grain {{refinement}} and cooling rate on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a secondary AlSi 7 Cu 3 Mg alloy were reported. Metallographic and image analysis techniques {{have been used}} to quantitatively examine the macrostructural and microstructural changes occurring with the addition of grain-refining agent at different cooling rates by using a step casting die. The results indicate that the addition of AlTi 5 B 1 produces a fine and uniform grain structure throughout the casting and this effect is more pronounced in the slowly solidified regions. Increasing the cooling rate, lower amount of grain refiner is necessary to produce a uniform grain size throughout the casting. On the other hand, the initial contents of Ti and B, present as impurity elements in the supplied <b>secondary</b> <b>alloy,</b> are not sufficient to produce an effective grain refinement. The results from the step casting geometry were applied to investigate a gasoline 16 V cylinder head, which was produced by gravity semi-permanent mould technology.

40|$|Control of {{impurity}} {{elements in}} Al-based alloys is of increasing technological importance, both in primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>alloy</b> production. In primary alloy production, Ni and V {{concentrations in the}} coke are rising and this is increasing the level of impurities in the final products {{to the extent that}} they are out of specification. Impurity control is also of concern in recycling due to the pickup of elements such as Fe from contaminants in the scrap, which can detrimentally affect the alloy properties. Dissolved elemental impurities can be removed by a number of different processes including boron treatment for some of the transition metals. Other processes in the cast shop for removing impurities and inclusions from Al melts include fluxing, floatation, and filtration. Gas purging, vacuum treatment, filtration, the use of salts, and combinations of these presently find commercial applications. Ultra purity Al and its alloys can be obtained using zone refining and three-layer electrolysis methods. The demand for higher purity Al has been largely met by additional electrolytic refining processes.

40|$|A great {{contribution}} {{to the use of}} aluminium alloys comes from improvements in casting process. High-pressure die-casting allow to increase production and permit to realise complex-shaped castings with thin wall thickness. This is possible because the molten metal is injected at high velocity inside the die cavity and then it rapidly solidifies. However, these features reduce the quality of the component due to a substantial amount of air/gas entrapped during the filling phase. This denies the opportunity for further property enhancement by heat treatment at high temperature. Due to difficulty to produce high integrity die-castings, generally inexpensive secondary alloys are used. In order to eliminate or at least reduce the amount of entrapped porosity, semi-solid metal forming processes have been developed. In this work, the microstructural and mechanical evolutions of an AlSi 7 Cu 3 Mg <b>secondary</b> <b>alloy</b> die-cast at semi-solid state by SEED process are investigated over different heat treatment conditions. The spheroidization of eutectic Si, the progressive dissolution of Cu-rich phases and the hardness variations of the alloy were observed and quantified.

40|$|A {{new concept}} for a stable anode for {{aluminum}} electrowinning is described. The anode {{consists of a}} cup-shaped metal alloy container filled with a molten salt that contains dissolved aluminum. The metal alloy can be any {{of a number of}} alloys, but it must contain aluminum as a <b>secondary</b> <b>alloying</b> metal. A possible alloy composition is copper with 5 to 15 weight percent aluminum. In the presence of oxygen, aluminum on the metal anode's exterior surface forms a continuous alumina film that is thick enough to protect the anode from chemical attack by cryolite during electrolysis and thin enough to maintain electrical conductivity. However, the alumina film is soluble in cryolite, so it must be regenerated in situ. Film regeneration is achieved by the transport of aluminum metal from the anode's molten salt interior through the metal wall to the anode's exterior surface, where the transported aluminum oxidizes to alumina in the presence of evolving oxygen to maintain the protective alumina film. Periodic addition of aluminum metal to the anode's interior keeps the aluminum activity in the molten salt at the desired level.

Design/methodology/approach: Specimens of copper alloys, whose compositions were close to those of ancient copper-based artefacts, were left to be corroded in simulated soil solution containing ammoniacal buffering solution of pH = 10 in 1 : 1 ratio, in order to accelerate the corrosion rate. The elemental compositions of the surface corrosion products were determined versus time using X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy, and the surface morphology by Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Micro-detector methods, and the results were compared to the bulk composition, as measured by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy.
