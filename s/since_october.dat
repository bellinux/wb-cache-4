5|$|Djokovic {{would then}} suffer his own {{thrashing}} {{at the hands}} of Dominic Thiem in the quarter-finals of the French Open, when he lost in straight sets, including losing the third set 6-0, his first bagel at a grand slam tournament since 2005. This further emphasised that Djokovic was still very far from his best form. Following this loss, he fell to world No.4, his lowest ranking <b>since</b> <b>October</b> 2009 and his first time outside the top two of the rankings since March 2011. In contrast, Nadal breezed through to the French Open final without dropping a set, including a third round match where he only lost one game. Murray, meanwhile, bounced back from his recent poor form by reaching the semi-finals, but lost to Stan Wawrinka in a five-set epic. Nadal then defeated Wawrinka in the final to become the first player in the Open Era to win ten titles at a single slam. This win also ended a three-year drought of slam titles for the Spaniard, his last title coming at the French Open in 2014. Following the win, Nadal returned to world No. 2, his highest ranking <b>since</b> <b>October</b> 2014.|$|E
