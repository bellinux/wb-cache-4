After discussions with the band, the plan for the video changed: the protagonist was kept, and instead the video featured a story where the protagonist was hurt by different characters and by society, culminating in a scene where he lost <b>something</b> <b>important</b> to him. The video was recorded like a theatrical play, and incorporated optical illusions created by stage techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{antagonism}} of abjad versus alphabet, {{as it was}} {{formulated by}} Daniels, has been rejected by other scholars because abjad is also used as a term {{not only for the}} Arabic numeral system but, which is most important in terms of historical grammatology, also as term for the alphabetic device (i.e. letter order) of ancient Northwest Semitic scripts in opposition to the 'south Arabian' order. This caused fatal effects on terminology in general and especially in (ancient) Semitic philology. Also, it suggests that consonantal alphabets, in opposition to for instance the Greek alphabet, were not yet true alphabets and not yet entirely complete, lacking <b>something</b> <b>important</b> to be a fully working script system. It has also been objected that, as a set of letters, an alphabet is not the mirror of what should be there in a language from a phonemic or even phonological point of view, rather, it is the data stock of what provides maximum efficiency with least effort from a semantic point of view.|$|E

500|$|A diaphonemic {{inventory}} is {{a specific}} diasystem (a term popularized by Uriel Weinreich) that superimposes dialectal contrasts to access all contrasts in all dialects that are included. [...] This consists of a shared core inventory and, when accounting for contrasts not made by all dialects (whether they are historical contrasts that have been lost or innovative ones not made in all varieties [...] ), only as many contrasts as are needed. The diaphonemic approach gets away from the assumption that linguistic communities are homogeneous, allows multiple varieties to be described in the same terms (<b>something</b> <b>important</b> for situations where people have abilities {{in more than one}} variety), and helps in ascertaining where speakers make diaphonic identifications as a result of similarities and differences between the varieties involved.|$|E

On the topic of O'Malley performing open heart surgery in an elevator, Knight said: [...] "It's a slow change but he's starting to realize, 'The way I have been doing things is not working.' The big thing about the open-heart surgery in the elevator was he was forced into it. He needs to be kind of kicked in the (butt) to do these things." ...|$|E

500|$|Cochrane {{argues that}} while {{each of the}} schools of thought he has {{considered}} has problems, they all have <b>something</b> <b>important</b> {{to contribute to the}} debate. Utilitarianism's most important contribution is its focus on sentience, but its major failing is its lack of respect for individuals. Liberalism, on the other hand, asserts the centrality of the individual. Communitarianism, though it is too ready to attribute cohesion to the values of a given society, observes that individuals can flourish only within appropriate communities, and stresses the importance of changing the views of society at large. This latter idea is shared by Marxism, which points out that legal change does not necessarily equate to effective change. While Cochrane does not agree that capitalism must be overthrown, he recognises that [...] "fundamental shifts in the organisation, norms and institutions of society" [...] are needed for justice to be extended to animals. Care-based feminist approaches, despite Cochrane's criticism, remind us that emotions and sympathy should not be ignored.|$|E

McKee offered her thoughts: [...] "Meredith and Lexie both want to succeed. They want to be strong. They want to feel normal. They want, so much, to be whole. But it’s a struggle – a genuine struggle for them. Being hardcore doesn’t come naturally. Sometimes, they have to fake it." [...] Grey's personality has been compared with that of Alex Karev's.
