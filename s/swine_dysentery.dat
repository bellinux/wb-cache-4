Background of Invention <b>Swine</b> <b>dysentery</b> is a significant endemic disease of pigs in Australia and worldwide. <b>Swine</b> <b>dysentery</b> is a contagious mucohaemorrhagic diarrhoeal disease, characterised by extensive inflammation and necrosis of the epithelial surface of the large intestine. Economic losses due to <b>swine</b> <b>dysentery</b> result mainly from growth retardation, costs of medication and mortality. The causative agent of <b>swine</b> <b>dysentery</b> was first identified as an anaerobic spirochaete (then called Treponema hyodysenteriae) in 1971, and was recently reassigned to the genus Brachyspira as B. hyodysenteriae. The disease spectrum for <b>swine</b> <b>dysentery</b> can vary from being mild, transient or unapparent, to being severe and even fatal. Medication strategies in individual piggeries may mask clinical signs and in some piggeries the disease may go unnoticed, or may only be suspected. Whether or not obvious disease occurs, B. hyodysenteriae may persist in infected pigs, or in other reservoir hosts such as rodents, or in the environment. All these sources pose potential for transmission of the disease to uninfected herds. Colonisation by B. hyodysenteriae elicits a strong immunological response against the spirochaete, hence indirect evidence {{of exposure to the}} spirochaete can be obtained by measuring circulating antibody titres in the blood of infected animals. These antibody titres have been reported to be maintained at low levels, even in animals that have recovered from <b>swine</b> <b>dysentery.</b> Serological tests for detection of antibodies therefore have considerable potential for detecting subclinical infections and recovered carrier pigs that have undetectable numbers of spirochaetes in their large intestines. These tests would be particularly valuable in an easy to use kit form, such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay...|$|E

Oral inoculation of gnotobiotic pigs with Vibrio coli and/or a peptostreptococcus in addition to T. hyodysenteriae did not result in dysentery. Neutralization of gastric secretions with NaHCO 3 immediately prior to inoculation with T. hyodysenteriae increased the period during which treponemes were evident in the feces, as did the inoculation of this organism via the intracecal route. None of the gnotobiotic pigs with a persistent fecal Treponema population developed signs of dysentery. Factors other than those investigated in this work must play a part in the etiology of <b>swine</b> <b>dysentery...</b>|$|E
40|$|Summary. The haemolysin from a {{virulent strain}} of Treponerna hyodysenteriae was {{extracted}} and injected into ligated loops of the ileum and colon of germ-free pigs. It caused severe epithelial damage, {{especially to the}} differentiated cells at {{the tips of the}} villi in the ileum and the cells in the intercrypt zones of the colon; goblet cells were less affected. The changes in the colon were similar to those seen in natural cases of <b>swine</b> <b>dysentery.</b> The ligated loop offers a means of investigating pathogenic mechanisms and the mode of action of the toxin. This study demonstrated that the haemolysin was a potent cytotoxin for pig enterocytes, and a probable virulence determinant in <b>swine</b> <b>dysentery...</b>|$|E
40|$|Our {{previous}} experiments (1, 2) {{have demonstrated}} that the clinical expression of <b>swine</b> <b>dysentery</b> (SD), a mucohaemorrhagic colitis caused by the anaerobic spirochaete Serpulina hyodysenteriae, can be reduced by feeding a diet low in soluble non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and/or resistant starch (RS) ...|$|E
40|$|Brachyspira hyodysenteriae is {{the primary}} cause of <b>swine</b> <b>dysentery,</b> which is {{responsible}} for major economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. The hemolytic activity of 10 B. hyodysenteriae strains isolated from stools of pigs with mild to mucohemorrhagic diarrhea was compared and seven hemolysis associated genes were sequenced. Hemolysis induced by these strains varied from strong to near absent. One weakly hemolytic B. hyodysenteriae strain showed sequence changes in five hemolysis associated genes (tlyA, tlyB, hemolysin III, hemolysin activation protein and hemolysin III channel protein) resulting in amino acid substitutions. The occurrence of weakly hemolytic strains identifiable as B. hyodysenteriae should be taken into account in <b>swine</b> <b>dysentery</b> diagnostics. The presence of these strains may affect herd dysentery status, with great impact on a farms trading opportunities...|$|E
