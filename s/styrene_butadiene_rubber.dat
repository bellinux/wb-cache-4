40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} {{the interest of the}} morphological representative pattern (MRP) micromechanical approach. This approach denes a micromechanics framework that accounts for the material morphological characteristics. The MRP approach within a self-consistent scheme was introduced by Bornert (1996, Comput. Mater. Sci., 5, 17 - 31) and it was mainly applied by him and his coauthors. In a recent work (Diani et al., 2013, Mech. Mater., 59, 65 - 72.), the authors studied the viscoelastic behavior of several carbon-black filled <b>styrene</b> <b>butadiene</b> <b>rubbers</b> (SBR). The experimental data showed evidences in favor of the existence of an interphase at the rubber-filler interface, with enhanced viscoelastic propertiescompared to the bulk matrix viscoelasticity. The behavior and the thickness of the interphase were estimated using a plain 4 -layered spherical inclusion model. The model show very good estimate ofthe viscoelasticity of several filled SBRs but the interphase thickness was estimated to an arguably large value of 5 nm for spherical particle of 30 nm of radius. Therefore, it seems interesting to apply a modeling approach that allows us to introduce more morphological parameters and see how theinterphase thickness evolves. With the MRP approach, one may study the impact of parameters like particle concentration, particle size distribution and particle distance distribution. The method isapplied to our carbon-black filled rubbers for which the carbon-black clusters are approximated by spherical elastic particle and the polymer interphase and matrix are viscoelastic. The mechanical behavior of the constitutive phases are realistic and therefore the behavior of the homogeneous equivalent media are compared to the behavior of an actual carbon-black filled SBR. Considering actual materials will give a realistic framework to study the impact of some of the theoretical parameters of the MRP approach...|$|R

The XSBR latex benefits from excellent mechanical and chemical stability, excellent liquidity, high bond and conjunction strength, high toughness and the strength after molding, low water absorption and air shrinkage, excellent durability, abrasion, oil and corrosion resistance of cement products. Due to the polarity offered by carboxyl groups, fiber, and particulate composites of XSBR exhibit improved physical and mechanical properties.

40|$|Abstract. We have {{measured}} the friction force {{acting on a}} rubber block slid on a concrete surface. We used both unfilled and filled (with carbon black) <b>styrene</b> <b>butadiene</b> (SB) <b>rubber</b> and have varied the temperature from − 10 ◦C to 100 ◦C and the sliding velocity from 1 μm/s to 1000 μm/s. We find that the experimental data at different temperatures can be shifted into a smooth master-curve, using the temperature-frequency shifting factors obtained from measurements of the bulk viscoelastic modulus. The experimental data has been analyzed using a theory which {{takes into account the}} contributions to the friction from both the substrate asperity-induced viscoelastic deformations of the rubber, and from shearing the area of real contact. For filled SB rubber the frictional shear stress σf in the area of real contact results mainly from the energy dissipation at the opening crack on the exit side of the rubber-asperity contact regions. For unfilled rubber we instead attribute σf to shearing of a thin rubber smear film, which is deposited on the concrete surface during run in. We observe very different rubber wear processes for filled and unfilled SB rubber, which is consistent with the different frictional processes. Thus, the wear of filled SB rubber results in micrometer-sized rubber particles which accumulate as dry dust, which is easily removed by blowing air on the concrete surface. This wear process seams to occur at a steady rate. For unfilled rubber a smear film forms on the concrete surface, which cannot be removed even using a high-pressure air stream. In this case the wear rate appears to slow down after some run in time period. ...|$|R

40|$|Development of structure-properties {{relationships}} between the fillers/rubber matrix interface chemistry and the dispersion and interfacial adhesion properties of the rubber composites is critical to predict their bulk mechanical and tribological properties. In this paper, three solution <b>styrene</b> <b>butadiene</b> <b>rubber</b> (SSBR) composites containing various fillers with tailored interfacial chemistry were prepared via conventional mixing technique. Subsequently, thermal and structural features of filled SSBR composites were monitored by TG, DSC, XRD, XPS, FESEM and TEM, respectively.

It was shown that the SSBR filled with silicon dioxide nanoparticles significantly reduced both the friction coefficient and the wear against marble block. On the contrary, it exhibited an increased friction coefficient and wear under wet friction conditions due to the specific superior wet-skid resistance of silicon dioxide nanopartilce filled rubber composites, a good dispersion of silicon dioxide nanopartilce in the rubber matrix and strong interfacial adhesion between nanoparticles and rubber matrix.
