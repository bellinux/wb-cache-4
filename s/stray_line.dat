STICKING to a LINE from {{the depth of}} 236 fathoms; hence this coral either must have been floating loose, or was entangled in <b>stray</b> <b>line</b> at the bottom. Off Keeling atoll a compound Ascidia (Sigillina) was brought up from 39 fathoms, {{and a piece of}} sponge, apparently living, from 70, and a fragment of Nullipora also apparently living from 92 fathoms. At a greater depth than 90 fathoms off this coral island, the bottom was thickly strewed with joints of Halimeda and small fragments of other Nulliporae, but all dead. Captain B. Allen, R.N., informs me that in the survey of the West Indies it was noticed that between the depth of 10 and 200 fathoms, the sounding lead very generally came up coated with the dead joints of a Halimeda, of which he showed me specimens. Off Pernambuco, in Brazil, in about twelve fathoms, the bottom was covered with fragments dead and alive of a dull red Nullipora, and I infer from Roussin's chart, that a bottom of this kind extends over a wide area. On the beach, within the coral-reefs of Mauritius, vast quantities of fragments of Nulliporae were piled up. From these facts it appears, that these simply organized bodies are amongst the most abundant productions of the sea.) ...|$|E

She compares the style of the authors to a different language where a <b>stray</b> <b>line</b> or word can stick out. Holmes says that she is in charge of editing and making sure that the book sounds correct. The books are all told in a third person narrative though the point of view changes with each series. The first series, the original Warriors series, followed Firepaw. Then in the second series, The New Prophecy, the view switched between Firepaw's, now Firestar's two daughters, Squirrelpaw and Leafpaw, in addition to Tigerstar's son, Brambleclaw, and Graystripe's son and daughter, Stormfur and Feathertail in Moonrise. In the Power of Three series, it goes back between Firestar's grandchildren Lionblaze, Jayfeather, and Hollyleaf. In the Omen of the Stars series, it goes between Lionblaze, Jayfeather, Dovepaw, and Ivypaw. In Night Whispers, it also includes the perspective of Flametail of ShadowClan, which is the only time it has been out of ThunderClan in the four main series since Moonrise. In Dawn of the Clans, the point of view switches between Gray Wing, Clear Sky, and Thunder. In the Seekers series, the point of view alternates between the three bears, Lusa, Kallik and Toklo until The Last Wilderness, where Ujurak's point of view is added in with the other three. In the Survivors series, the point of view is focused on Lucky, the Lone Dog turned beta.|$|E
40|$|Abstract − In {{this paper}} some basic topologies of direct PWM AC {{choppers}} are presented. Compared with the phase-controlled AC controllers using thyristors the PWM AC Choppers have important advantages: sinusoidal current waveforms, better power factor, faster dynamics and smaller input/output filters. They present high robustness, offer safe commutation and have high efficiency. The paper describes operational principles {{and analysis of}} three basic direct topologies using a very simple DC snubber consisting of a capacitor only with no discharging resistors. This DC snubber is directly attached to power commutation cells to absorb energy stored in <b>stray</b> <b>line</b> inductances. There are also shown some modern line conditioners made up of basic PWM AC choppers and a transformer for series voltage compensation...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{handwritten}} document {{images is}} one of the key areas of research in image processing domain. The objective of the analysis is to recognize the text components in an image and extract the intended information. However, inscription of handwriting usually would be on documents with rule lines, since they act as guide lines to the writer to ensure the writing remains straight and is of uniform size. These lines make the task of recognition difficult and hence removing them automatically becomes a major issue in text image processing. To accomplish this objective, an attempt is being made in this paper to remove the horizontal rule lines and vertical margin line for efficient recognition and analysis of the foreground text. Using mathematical morphology, predominant horizontal and vertical lines are removed leaving out <b>stray</b> <b>lines</b> which hinder the further processing of text. The <b>stray</b> <b>lines</b> are identified and removed using entropy with sliding window based on dynamic thresholding...|$|R

In Alzheimer's disease, the total score on the clock-drawing test correlates with the score on the Modified “Mini-Mental State” Examination.

40|$|Abstract:- A {{closed loop}} {{bidirectional}} ac to ac buck boost converter circuit using power MOSFET is analyzed {{for reducing the}} output voltage sag and improving efficiency of the converter. The regenerative dc snubbers are used directly to power semiconductor switches to absorb energy stored in <b>stray</b> <b>line</b> inductances. These dc snubbers enhance the conversion efficiency as it has very simple structure consisting only of a capacitor. A fast response peak voltage detector for fast output voltage control is also proposed. It is observed from the simulation results obtained using MATLAB simulink, that the proposed closed loop scheme gives good dynamic and steady state performances with a high-quality output voltage, improved power factor, low harmonics, improved efficiency and significant reduction of the filter size...|$|E

40|$|Doppler {{difference}} interference spectrometer {{is a kind}} of Fourier transform spectrometer. In {{the process}} of atmospheric wind velocity retrieval, even-prolongated recovered spectrum cannot work out the phase information of the target spectral line directly. Meanwhile, there are <b>stray</b> spectral <b>lines</b> and noises in the recovered spectrum, which make the phase of the interferogram changed and the retrieved wind velocity deviated. Therefore, isolation of the target spectral line is necessary in the process of getting the phase information of the recovered spectrum in actual noisy environment. For interferograms with different signal noise ratios the retrieved wind velocities (SNR) optimized by different window functions with different line widths are analyzed by Monte-Carlo method. The results indicate that the Gaussian window function with line width equaling 4 to 5 times of the spectral resolution provides the best performance if the SNR of the measured interferogram is higher than 26. 5 dB, and rectangular window function with line width equaling 7 to 12 times-of the spectral resolution provides the best performance if the SNR of the measured interferogram is lower than 26. 5 dB. The phase information and the approximative atmospheric wind velocity can be retrieved. © 2017, Chinese Lasers Press. All right reserved. </p...|$|R

As the road crossed both the main line and the loop siding, access through the station yard on the road was controlled by station gates which were frequently being left open, making it possible for stock to escape.

By fitting the results of time dependent disk models to observed time scales of FU Orionis events, we estimate the magnitude of the effeciency of the effective viscous stress in the inner disk (r < 1 AU) to be, in accordance with the ad hoc "alpha" prescription, 10 ^- 4 where hydrogen is neutral and 10 ^- 3 where hydrogen is ionized. We hypothesize that all YSOs receive infall onto their outer disks which is steady (or slowly declining with time) and that FU Orionis outbursts are self-regulated, disk outbursts which occur only in systems which transport matter inward at a rate sufficiently high to cause hydrogen to be ionized in the inner disk. We estimate a critical mass flux of 5 x 10 ^- 7 solar masses / year independent of the magnitude of alpha for systems with one solar mass, three solar radius central objects. Infall accretion rates in the range of (1 - 10) x 10 ^- 6 solar masses per year produce observed FU Orionis time scales consistent with estimates of spherical molecular cloud core collapse rates.
