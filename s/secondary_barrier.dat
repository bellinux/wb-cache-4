40|$|Here, {{we report}} on the design of braided {{peripheral}} nerve conduits with barrier coatings. Braiding of extruded polymer fibers generates nerve conduits with excellent mechanical properties, high flexibility, and significant kink-resistance. However, braiding also results in variable levels of porosity in the conduit wall, which can lead to the infiltration of fibrous tissue into the interior of the conduit. This problem can be controlled by the application of <b>secondary</b> <b>barrier</b> coatings. Using a critical size defect in a rat sciatic nerve model, the importance of controlling the porosity of the nerve conduit walls was explored. Braided conduits without barrier coatings allowed cellular infiltration that limited nerve recovery. Several types of <b>secondary</b> <b>barrier</b> coatings were tested in animal studies, including (1) electrospinning a layer of polymer fibers onto the surface of the conduit and (2) coating the conduit with a cross-linked hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel.

The cumulative increase in expenditures on USdomestic homeland security over the decade since 9 / 11 exceeds one trillion dollars. How much of this expenditure is necessary? and how much has been effective? The use of risk-based decision theory to determine acceptability of risk is crucial to prioritise protective measures for critical infrastructure. Structural reliability and probabilistic methods are used to assess risk reduction due to protective measures, particularly since loading and response of structures to explosive blast loading is subject to uncertainty and variability. The paper will describe a cost-benefit analysis that considers threat likelihood, cost of security and protective measures, risk reduction and expected losses to compare costs and benefits to decide which protective measures are cost-effective, and those which are not.

40|$|The Gilroy-Phillips {{model of}} relaxational jumps in {{asymmetric}} double well potentials, {{developed for the}} Arrhenius-type secondary relaxations of the glass phase, is extended to a formal description of {{the breakdown of the}} shear modulus at the glass transition, the α-process. The extension requires the introduction of two separate parts of the barrier distribution function f(V), with a different temperature behavior of primary and secondary parts, respectively. The time-temperature scaling of the α-process, together with a sum rule for the whole barrier distribution function, implies a strong rise of the integrated secondary relaxation with increasing temperature above the glass transition. Thus one gets {{for the first time a}} quantitative relation between the fragility of the glass former and the fast rise of the picosecond process observed in neutron and Raman scattering. The formalism is applied to literature data of polystyrene, vitreous silica and a sodium silicate glass. In the glass phase of polystyrene, one finds a temperature-independent <b>secondary</b> <b>barrier</b> distribution function, in agreement with an earlier Raman result from the literature.

40|$|The {{petroleum}} industry uses {{a variety of}} qualitative risk assessment methods for maintaining well integrity, such as well barrier schematics and barrier diagrams. Identifying barriers and using well barrier schematics are helpful tools in qualitative risk assessments. However, {{it is not yet}} clear if these methods can be applied for risk assessments in the geothermal industry. Geothermal wells often produce directly through the casing, instead of through production tubing, making it difficult to identify two independent barrier envelopes in accordance to NORSOK D- 010. High temperatures and corrosion are the most common contributors to failure in geothermal wells. In this study, a hypothetical case of a downhole corrosion problem was assessed by means of conducting a qualitative risk analysis and identifying well barriers in a geothermal well. This study shows that qualitative risk assessment methods from the {{petroleum industry}} are applicable using minor adjustments to well barrier interpretation and barrier diagrams. Using NORSOK D- 010 as a guideline, the study found that typical Icelandic high temperature geothermal wells may consist of a primary and a <b>secondary</b> <b>barrier</b> envelope with a common well barrier element at the wellhead. At shallow depths, the intermediate casing, often the anchor casing, acts as a <b>secondary</b> <b>barrier</b> against an aquifer. In addition, the study indicates that production of low enthalpy fluids and its financial impact might be the main concerns of downhole corrosion problems close to the production casing shoe. Findings in this study could form the foundation for raising the standard of risk assessment methods for high temperature geothermal wells, and the well barrier interpretations defined in this thesis may be suitable for a number of these types of wells...|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} two decades it has been widely {{acknowledged}} within the management literature that the evaluation of change rarely takes place within organizations, yet little coherent explanation has been offered as to why this should be so. This article reports on research undertaken in two UK public sector organizations, to explore the reality of evaluation in the context of change, with the intention of identifying the barriers to evaluation that existed and the factors that created them. The analysis of the empirical evidence led to the identification of two distinct types of barrier to evaluation, labelled primary (factors that act against an evaluation being undertaken) and secondary (factors that arise during an evaluation process). Primary barriers were rooted in contextual factors contained in the organization’s history and culture; the background against which the change initiative took place. <b>Secondary</b> <b>barriers</b> relate directly to the choices and decisions involved in the evaluation process itself and therefore only become significant once a decision to undertake an evaluation has been made.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the shielding designs of a 6 MeV x-ray linear accelerator scanner used for cargo-container scanning at the port of Tema in Ghana. Workload of the facility had increased significantly over time necessitating review of the installed shielding. There had been introduction of x-ray unit with higher energy (from 5 MeV to 6 MeV) increasing absorbed dose per scan. The number of scans per day had increased from an average of 60 to 95 scans. New structures had been built around the facility without particular attention to their distances and orientations with respect to the radiation source. The principle that the product of the weekly time average dose rates (Rw) and the occupancy for a particular point of interest (location) should not exceed the design dose limit, P (i. e. P ≥ RwT) for that location was partly used to determine the adequacy of the shielding afforded by the barriers. In addition to P ≥ RwT, calculated and measured hourly time average dose rates (Rh) were used to establish the adequacy of the shieldings based on the dose limit of 0. 5 µSv/h for public and supervised areas (uncontrolled areas).

This effect is demonstrated not only on CdS-buffered devices but also on Zn(O,S) - and In 2 S 3 -buffered cells.

40|$|CIGS {{solar cells}} {{in many cases}} show a failure of light/dark {{superposition}} of their current-voltage (J-V) curves. Such failure generally becomes more pronounced at lower temperatures. J-V measurements under red light may also show an additional distortion, known historically as the “red kink”. The proposed explanation is that a <b>secondary</b> <b>barrier</b> results from the conduction band offset between CIGS and the commonly employed CdS window layer. This barrier produces a second diode with the same polarity and in series with the primary photodiode. The secondary-diode barrier height is modified by photoinduced changes of trap occupancy in the CdS layer, hence creating a voltage shift between dark and light conditions. Numerical modeling of the proposed explanation, including a band offset consistent with experimental and theoretical values, gives a very good fit to measured light and dark J-V curves over a wide temperature range. It also predicts the observed difference between illuminated J-V curves with photon energy above the CdS band gap, and those with sub-band-gap illumination...|$|E
40|$|In the North Sea, {{the average}} field age is {{increasing}} {{and a large}} number of wells needs to be plugged and abandoned in the future. P&A is regarded as an operation with no financial returns and is associated with significantly high costs. With a continuous {{increase in the number of}} wells that require abandonment and a falling oil price, the major focus for the oil industry is reducing costs while ensuring safe and reliable plugging of wells. The conventional method for placing a plug in a cased hole with no external barrier has required section milling of the casing, underreaming the open hole, and placing a balanced cement plug. The conventional method is time-consuming and costly, and is associated with several challenges and risks concerning Health, Safety and Environment (HSE). To reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of P&A operations, more attention has been directed towards the subject of P&A in recent years. This thesis has examined and presented the conventional section milling technology along with its limitations and challenges, and compared it with new technology’s with respect to time and scope. The main focus has been the new perforate, wash and cement (PWC) technology developed by HydraWell, and its advancement in the P&A operation. A case study comparing the conventional section milling operation with the PWC operation has been performed. Other investigated alternatives include reverse/upward section milling and plasma-based milling. This thesis also gives an insight into the process of plugging a well, including regulations and requirements, plugging materials, placement techniques, cement evaluation tools and challenges with the P&A process. The main findings revealed that most of the challenges with the section milling operation can be led back to the generated swarf.

The construction of a bicultural identity presents a challenge due to the particular philosophical foundations of the French nation-state and French culture.
