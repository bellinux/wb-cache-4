5|$|Manchester City had {{a strong}} season in 1955–56, {{finishing}} fourth {{in the league and}} reached the FA Cup final against Birmingham City. Trautmann, one of the team's most prominent performers, won the FWA Footballer of the Year Award shortly before the match, the first goalkeeper to win the award. Two days later, Trautmann <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the Wembley pitch for the match that would gain him worldwide acclaim.|$|E
25|$|Priscilla Tirado was {{too weak}} to grab the line when the {{helicopter}} returned to her. A watching bystander, Congressional Budget Office assistant Lenny Skutnik, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, dove into the icy water and swam out to successfully pull her to shore. The helicopter then proceeded to where Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the helicopter skid and grabbed her by the clothing to lift her onto the skid with him, bringing her to shore. When the helicopter crew returned for Williams, the wreckage he was strapped into had rolled slightly, submerging him—according to the coroner, Williams was the only passenger to die by drowning. His body and those of the other occupants were later recovered.|$|E
500|$|Crowds of {{citizens}} had gathered outside {{the steps and}} gates of ʻIolani Palace expecting the announcement of a new constitution. Among them were White and members of Hui Kālaiʻāina who had presented a sealed package containing the constitution. After the ministers' refusal to sign the new constitution, the queen <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the balcony and asked the assembled people to return home, declaring [...] "their wishes for a new constitution could not be granted just then, but will be some future day". Representative White also gave a speech to this crowd on the palace steps although {{the exact nature of}} what he said is disputed. Opponents of the monarchy, especially the conservatives in the Reform Party, later claimed he gave an inflammatory and violent speech inciting the crowd to storm the palace and [...] "go in and kill and bury" [...] either the queen or her cabinet ministers. The speech may have been in Hawaiian and was only paraphrased in the English press. On January16, The Pacific Commercial Advertiser, an English newspaper in Honolulu, sympathetic to the Reform Party, reported: ...|$|E

2500|$|Baker {{then ran}} to the {{entrance}} of the Texas School Book Depository, entered the building with his gun drawn, and led by building superintendent Roy Truly, {{made his way to the}} far northwest corner of the first floor. From there, Baker and Truly started yelling for someone to send an elevator down from a higher floor. When there was no response, the two men began climbing the stairs, with Truly in the lead. Approximately 90 seconds after the shots rang out, Baker <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the second floor and a movement towards the lunchroom vestibule across from the stairs caught his attention. Baker confronted Oswald at gunpoint. He let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee. According to Baker, Oswald did not appear to be nervous or out of breath. Truly said that Oswald appeared [...] "startled" [...] when Baker aimed his gun at him. According to the Warren Commission, Oswald was next seen by a secretary as he crossed through the second-floor business office carrying a soda bottle. He left the Texas School Book Depository through its front door at approximately 12:33p.m..|$|E
60|$|He took a {{deep breath}} and then <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the gray, rubbled ground. After a minute he lit a {{cigarette}} and stood gazing around him. The landscape was dead. Nothing stirred. He could see for miles, endless ash and slag, ruins of buildings. A few trees without leaves or branches, only the trunks. Above him the eternal rolling clouds of gray, drifting between Terra and the sun.|$|E
60|$|They {{passed along}} Piccadilly, across Leicester Square, {{and into the}} Strand. The wayfarers in the streets, of whom there were still plenty, seemed to be {{lingering}} about in sheer joy of the cooler night after the unexpected heat of the day, the women in light clothes, the men with their coats thrown open and carrying their hats. They passed down the Strand and into Adam Street, coming at last to a standstill before the tall, gloomy house {{at the corner of}} the Terrace. Arnold <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the pavement and helped his companion to alight. The chauffeur lifted his hat and the car glided away. As they stood there, for a moment, upon the pavement, and Arnold pushed open the heavy, shabby door, it seemed, indeed, as though the whole day might have been a dream.|$|E

6000|$|He stole upstairs. Not {{daring to}} have a bath, or shave (besides, the water would be cold), he changed his clothes and packed stealthily all he could. It was hard to leave so many shining boots, but one must {{sacrifice}} something. Then, carrying a valise in either hand, he <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the landing. The house was very quiet--that house where he had begotten his four children. It was a curious moment, this, outside the room of his wife, once admired, if not perhaps loved, who had called him 'the limit.' He steeled himself with that phrase, and tiptoed on; but the next door was harder to pass. It was the room his daughters slept in. Maud was at school, but Imogen would be lying there; and moisture came into Dartie's early morning eyes. She was the most like him of the four, with her dark hair, and her luscious brown glance. Just coming out, a pretty thing! He set down the two valises. This almost formal abdication of fatherhood hurt him. The morning light fell on a face which worked with real emotion. Nothing so false as penitence moved him; but genuine paternal feeling, and that melancholy of 'never again.' He moistened his lips; and complete irresolution for a moment paralysed his legs in their check trousers. It was hard--hard to be thus compelled to leave his home! [...] "D---nit!" [...] he muttered, [...] "I {{never thought it would}} come to this." [...] Noises above warned him that the maids were beginning to get up. And grasping the two valises, he tiptoed on downstairs. His cheeks were wet, and the knowledge of that was comforting, as though it guaranteed the genuineness of his sacrifice. He lingered a little in the rooms below, to pack all the cigars he had, some papers, a crush hat, a silver cigarette box, a Ruff's Guide. Then, mixing himself a stiff whisky and soda, and lighting a cigarette, he stood hesitating before a photograph of his two girls, in a silver frame. It belonged to Winifred. 'Never mind,' he thought; 'she can get another taken, and I can't!' He slipped it into the valise. Then, putting on his hat and overcoat, he took two others, his best malacca cane, an umbrella, and opened the front door. Closing it softly behind him, he walked out, burdened as he had never been in all his life, and made his way round the corner to wait there for an early cab to come by.|$|E

Lori puts on her USA jersey, <b>steps</b> <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the mound, and pitches another no-hitter against Jessie. It feels amazing to still be able to throw the ball hard, and she doesn't think she could have done that seven weeks ago.|$|R

50|$|In 1936, the University Student Council at Western {{put on a}} {{drive for}} funds to support the {{purchase}} of new uniforms. At this point, the U.W.O.

The dramatic and peculiar circumstances surrounding his death were reported in foreign media. <b>Stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the balcony of his home to greet a throng of admirers, the balcony inexplicably collapsed, killing Padovani and eight others. Foul play has long been suspected, as Padovani's lingering popularity and influence were a probable source of unease on Mussolini's part.|$|R

However the final shot shows, not an astronaut boot, but Gene Hunt's signature white loafer taking the first step onto the martian surface, casting doubt once again onto the ending.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1981 season, Oregon State was mired in a 14-game losing streak. In the previous 24 games, the winning points in the Beavers' only victory came on a kick returning error. The first team on the Beavers' schedule was the Fresno State Bulldogs, fresh off a victory over the Oregon Ducks. Oddly, the Beavers <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the field as 15-point favorites. 28,000 turned out to see what most hoped would be Oregon State's first win in two years. On the third play from scrimmage, Fresno State's Sergio Toscan threw an 81-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 Bulldog lead. He followed it up with a five-yard touchdown pass later in the first quarter, 14-0. In the second quarter, Fresno State tacked on another touchdown on a blocked punt, 21-0.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, {{there was}} nothing to be gained from lurking behind a tree. He left his cover, and started to stroll in the {{direction}} of the pavilion. Having arrived there, he sat on the <b>steps,</b> looking <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the cricket field.|$|R
50|$|To protect {{maintenance}} {{workers from}} electrocution, all high-voltage cabinets have safety switches which automatically lower the pantograph if the cabinet is opened while the power car is energized.

For passenger safety, all doors are equipped with position sensors which notify the engineer whether all doors are shut (however, in practice it is standard operating procedure for the fireman to <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the platform and check the doors visually).|$|R

5000|$|The theatre was {{formally}} inaugurated on 5 January 1875 with a lavish gala performance attended by Marshal MacMahon, the Lord Mayor of London and King Alfonso XII of Spain.

50|$|The {{news of the}} abdication {{came too}} late to make any {{impression}} on the demonstrators. Nobody heeded the public appeals. More and more demonstrators demanded the total abolition of the monarchy. Karl Liebknecht, just released from prison, had returned to Berlin and re-founded the Spartacist League the previous day. At lunch in the Reichstag, the SPD deputy chairman Philipp Scheidemann learned that Liebknecht planned the proclamation of a socialist republic. Scheidemann {{did not want to}} leave the initiative to the Spartacists and without further ado, he <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> a balcony of the Reichstag. From there, he proclaimed a republic before a mass of demonstrating people on his own authority (against Ebert's expressed will). A few hours later, the Berlin newspapers reported that in the Berlin Lustgarten - at probably around the same time — Liebknecht had proclaimed a socialist republic, which he affirmed from a balcony of the Berlin City Palace to an assembled crowd at around 4 pm.|$|E
5000|$|De Gaulle <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> {{the balcony}} {{to give a}} short address to the {{assembled}} masses which was also broadcast live on radio.

The speech appeared to conclude with the words [...] "Vive Montréal! Vive le Québec!" [...] ("Long live Montreal! Long live Quebec!"), but he then added, [...] "Vive le Québec libre! Vive, vive, vive le Canada français! Et vive la France!" [...] ("Long live free Quebec! Long live, long live, long live French Canada! And long live France!"), whereupon the crowd roared with approval, especially after hearing, [...] "Vive le Québec libre!". De Gaulle particularly emphasized {{the use of the word}} 'libre', as he leaned into the microphones and enunciated it more slowly and loudly than other elements of his speech.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, a new {{generation}} of Palestinian nationalist groups and movements began to organize clandestinely, <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the public stage in the 1960s. The traditional Palestinian elite who had dominated negotiations with the British and the Zionists in the Mandate, and who were largely held responsible for the loss of Palestine, were replaced by these new movements whose recruits generally came from poor to middle-class backgrounds and were often students or recent graduates of universities in Cairo, Beirut and Damascus. The potency of the pan-Arabist ideology put forward by Gamal Abdel Nasser—popular among Palestinians for whom Arabism was already an important component of their identity—tended to obscure the identities of the separate Arab states it subsumed.|$|R

Arriving at the stage, he sits on a stool (aibiki) and, in a special kind of monologue called tsurane, explains his story. It is made clear that he is capable of superhuman strength, being able to drive off some of Kiyohara's henchmen only by shouting at them with his eyes.|$|R
