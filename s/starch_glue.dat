However, the production of starch containing products, often encounter difficulties due to natural starch: in low shear resistance, temperature extremes, resistance to acidity. Also wheat starch contains non-starch materials such as lipids, proteins who initiates starch retrogradation process, which could affect product quality. Therefore, to improve and optimize properties of the starch, it is being modified. Aim {{of the study was}} to find the best way to modify natural wheat starch and determine its rheological properties. Different reagent ratios of starch modification, and changing the temperature of the reaction mixture has been produced in obtaining phosphorylated starch with good properties. It was determined how much elemental phosphorus has reacted with starch, calculated reaction efficiency, determined how much of di-starch monophosphate and mono starch monophosphate anion moles are in 1 g of starch by potentiometric titration. The phosphorylation kinetics showed that the optimum reaction time is 4 hours, rheological studies have showed that the best features of the starch which has been produced in a molar ratio of reagent was: [St]: [NaOH]: [STMP]: [H 2 O] = [1]: [8]: [0, 5]: [10] T = 45 °C.

The second type is thermal adhesives based on ethylene vinyl acetate, which are completely uninfluenced by the washing process. These glues can soften during shredding or the label removal process because of their low Tm, resulting in glue residue being attached to the PET. The last type is alkali-soluble glue. When it is exposed to NaOH solution (2  wt%), this glue crumbles and separates from the PET. This glue is the preferred option except for its higher cost compared with traditional adhesives.|$|R

P. frequentans isolates produce pectinase and cellulase at different degrees. There was a correlation between enzyme activity and the antagonistic ability for each isolate.

The aim and {{objective of the}} study are: to investigate the construction and manufacturing processes of the painted wall-hangings; to identify both the painting materials and other substances employed; and, to document painting techniques used by different painters within this painted wall-hanging tradition. This is to get an increased understanding of the materials and techniques used, and the material development of these painted objects during the 18 th and 19 th centuries. The study is interdisciplinary in which Art Technological Source Research (ATSR) is combined with conservation science. Non-destructive and non-invasive analytical methods were preferentially used. Therefore spectroscopic methods including multi-spectral imaging systems, FT-Raman with a micro video probe head, FTIR with diffuse reflectance and Electron Microscopy with Elemental Analysis (SEM-EDX) were applied. Most of these chemical and technical analyses are undertaken on site. Supplementing analyses using spot tests and experimental reconstructions of coloring matters from plants and possible binder composition has then been {{carried out in the}} laboratory. In order to understand the manufacturing process of the wall-hangings also mock-ups where made. Historical recipes have been used to make these reconstructions. The Results indicate that generally inexpensive pigments such as chalk, red lead, ochres, orpiment, carbon black and woad have been used. Some artificial pigments such as; Prussian blue, emerald green and chrome yellow were introduced in the wall-hangings {{in the latter part of}} the era.

This treatment, unfortunately, is not sufficient to remove specific contaminants like old glues or foxes. In this work we have investigated about the possibility of using opportunely modified hydrogels to solve heterogeneous problems. To this end, for example, we have prepared Gellan hydrogel loaded with hydrolytic enzymes to remove old glues. Moreover, as Gellan hydrogel itself, is not able to clean hydrophobic contaminants, we have performed experiments by preparing a “mixed Gellan gel” carrying opportune polimeric surfactants. In this system, the enzyme (or surfactant) works as selective cleaning agent, while the gel plays the role of support and removal matrix for the contaminants.

Para tanto, foi utilizado o processo de microencapsulação por atomização e os agentes encapsulantes goma arábica e grânulos porosos de amido/gelatina. A avaliação morfológica, feita por microscopia eletrônica de varredura, mostrou que as microcápsulas elaboradas com goma arábica possuíam formato arredondado, com concavidades, sem poros ou rachaduras, paredes contínuas e o recheio estava distribuído em vacúolos nas paredes; já as produzidas com grânulos porosos de amido/gelatina apresentavam formato arredondado, paredes formadas pela aglomeração dos grânulos e coladas pela gelatina, entretanto, apresentavam poros ou interstícios. A distribuição do tamanho de partículas apresentou comportamento unimodal, com tamanho médio de 16 e 20, 3 µm para as microcápsulas produzidas com goma e amido/gelatina, respectivamente.
