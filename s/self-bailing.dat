5000|$|The new {{lifeboat}} {{was of a}} self-righting, pulling and sailing type [...] and was 36 ft {{in length}} and a beam of 9 ft. The design encompassed air cases for reserve buoyancy, a low centre of gravity (iron drop keel), the ability to <b>self-bail</b> (relieving valves) and water ballast tanks which gave the lifeboat stability {{and the ability to}} self-right achieved {{as a result of the}} combination of these features.|$|R
25|$|The {{boat was}} built by Paceship Yachts in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada. It was first offered in 1967 in the Daysailer version, with a roomy cockpit and an open cuddy (cabin). By 1970 it was also offered in the MORCEE version, a {{modification}} of the original design, which was adapted {{to comply with the}} Midget Ocean Racing Club Rule (MORC) by fitting a <b>self-bailing</b> cockpit and enclosing the cabin. A total of at least 107 boats were produced (including both versions, based on known hulls) between 1967 and 1974. It is now out of production.|$|E

50|$|In 1966, Tord Sundén {{introduced}} the carvel-planked “International Folkboat”. This design corresponded {{largely to the}} original, but it offered more comfort below deck, {{and it had a}} <b>self-bailing</b> cockpit. However, the term “International Folkboat” was too misleading and was forbidden. Today, the class is simply called “IF-boat.” The IF-boat was manufactured at Marieholms Bruk in Småland (Sweden) until 1984.|$|E
50|$|In 1968 O'Day {{introduced}} the 2 + 2 model. It added 2 berths {{for a total}} of 4, a <b>self-bailing</b> cockpit, and extended the already large cockpit to the transom and eliminated the small rear deck. The first 2 + 2 is thought to be hull # 1385. These boats are highly sought after by collectors.|$|E

5000|$|Uffa Fox {{designed}} the Britannia rowboat, used by John Fairfax, {{used for the}} first solo-rowing expedition across the Atlantic Ocean in 1969. [...] The Britannia was described as [...] "the [...] of rowboats, made of mahogany." [...] It was self-righting, <b>self-bailing</b> and partly covered. He also designed Britannia II , used by John Fairfax and Sylvia Cook to row across the Pacific Ocean in 1971 through 1972.|$|E
5000|$|In North America (where {{the sport}} is known as [...] "open water rowing"), coastal rowing {{typically}} involves longer, lighter and faster boats, more similar to flat-water racing shells, yet designed for stability and safety in chop, wakes and swells. Stability is achieved by a broader waterline beam with safety ensured {{through the use of}} positive flotation, <b>self-bailing</b> capacity, supplemented by the rower's seamanship skills. North American boats do not conform to the minimum standards established by FISA, because they are too long and do not weigh enough.|$|E
5000|$|At 3000 lbs it {{included}} a 1250 lbs cast iron keel. Tempest 23 came standard with eight foot (8') <b>Self-bailing</b> cockpit, self-draining seats with storage, molded insulated ice box, Philippine mahogany trim, deck stepped mast, main roller reefing, full width mainsheet traveler, wirehalyards, two jib winches, separate galley and head enclosures, two (2) 6'6" [...] berths with storage, and a 2-year warranty.The sail plan {{consisted of a}} 115.00 sq. ft. mainsail, 113.10 sq. ft. jib and 339.00 sq. ft. spinnaker. [...] It can be sailed with a Tri-radial headsail.|$|E
50|$|Wahoo! {{boats were}} {{designed}} to be <b>self-bailing</b> and included features like a built-in gas tank and a drainable hull considered innovative at that time for the types of boats they were building. Unlike similar boat designs, which had foam filled hulls, Wahoo! boats had hulls lined with foam, with a space between the hull liner foam and the cap foam. This design allowed the inner hull of the boats to be drained of moisture. While primarily made of fiberglass, wood was utilized in the transom and other locations for reinforcement.|$|E
5000|$|After {{returning}} to England it took Fairfax {{two years to}} prepare for the row. On 19 July 1969 he became the first person to row solo across an ocean when he arrived in Florida having set off from the Canary Islands. The self-righting and <b>self-bailing</b> boat [...] "Britannia", now located in the National Maritime Museum Cornwall, was designed by Uffa Fox. The row took 180 days. Upon completion of his row he received a message of congratulations from the crew of Apollo 11 who had walked on the moon the day after he had completed his voyage. In their letter the crew stated: ...|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} {{life-saving}} stations were established on Sable Island {{by the governor}} of Nova Scotia, John Wentworth, in 1801. The rescue station began the continuous human presence on the island which continues today. Wentworth appointed James Morris, a Nova Scotian veteran of the British Royal Navy as the first superintendent of the island. Morris settled on the island in October 1801 with his family. By the time Morris died on the island in 1809, he had built up the humanitarian settlement to include a central station, two rescue boat stations, several lookout posts and survivor shelters. The station's rescue equipment was upgraded in 1854 with the latest generation of <b>self-bailing</b> lifeboats and life cars through the fundraising efforts of social reformer Dorothea Dix who had visited the island in the previous year.|$|E
50|$|To start it, {{there was}} a flush {{submerged}} pull start handle in the top surface of the deck by the engine hatch. Air feed to the engine was controlled by a flapper valve vent forward on {{the nose of the}} board's top surface. It sucked air in, porting it to the stern (or rear) of the craft. It was constructed of a heavy marine grade aircraft aluminum alloy to withstand the saltwater conditions it would be used in. The hull was <b>self-bailing</b> via a venturi effect off the grated forward water feed port, {{on the bottom of the}} board, that exhausted through the jet drive nozzle to rear for propulsion. It required routine maintenance to keep a tiny vent hole clear of seaweed or debris or the engine compartment would flood easily.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dramatic}} {{death of}} Joshua James occurred on March 19, 1902. Two days earlier {{all but one}} the Monomoy Point Life-Saving Station crew perished in a rescue attempt, drowned by the panicked victims of a ship wreck they were attempting to save. The tragedy affected Joshua deeply and convinced him {{of the need for}} even more rigid training of his own crew. At seven o'clock the morning of March 19, with a northeast gale blowing, James called his crew for a drill and to test a new <b>self-bailing,</b> self-righting surfboat. For more than an hour the 75-year-old man maneuvered the boat through the boisterous sea. He was pleased with the performance of the boat and the crew. Upon grounding the boat he sprang onto the wet sand, glanced at the sea and stated, [...] "The tide is ebbing" [...] and then fell dead on the beach from a heart attack.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{there was a}} variant made called the [...] "Pacific Thunderbird" [...] {{designed}} by Naval Architect Ben Seaborn, the original designer of the Thunderbird class. The sail logo was the Thunderbird logo inside a large letter P. It was a scaled-up version to a LOA of 32 ft. It was made in Japan of fiberglass covered plywood. It had a fixed keel with a depth of about 6 ft, a beam of about 9.5 ft, a <b>self-bailing</b> cockpit, and an inboard engine. The mast height and sail area were also reduced somewhat, so the boat was more stable. Below it had headroom of about 6 ft, a spacious enclosed head, a fixed table with folding leaves, a full galley (sink, icebox, counter, and stove), and births for 5 (with the fifth birth running under the port side cockpit seat). This design was still a fairly fast boat, yet more seaworthy and very comfortable for coastal cruising. There were, however, {{very few of them}} sold.|$|E
5000|$|The Coronado 15 (C-15) is a one-design {{class of}} sailing dinghy. These boats first came {{onto the scene}} in the late sixties and have gained the {{attention}} of racing and recreational skippers nationwide. The earlier boats are still raced and competitive. There are numerous one-class races throughout the country. The one-design focus of the fleet is in developing skill rather than [...] "deep pockets" [...] and innovation. They can be single-handed, but in racing one crew member is specified, and there is room for a third person when day sailing. When racing, the crew is on a trapeze, and the skipper hiked out with straps. These factors, combined with a planing hull can make for some exciting racing. The C-15 is known as being a comfortable and stable day sailor, or a confidence building racer. It is unsinkable, <b>self-bailing,</b> and easy to right when capsized. It features a friendly boom in that it is relatively high. The rigging can be made simple or developed and optimized as the skipper’s skills develop. Another feature is that with a centerboard and kick-up rudder the boat trailers easily and can be beached.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{articles}} in WoodenBoat magazine, Dynamite Payson published Instant Boats (1979, 152 pages, 7" [...] × 10", 48 illustrations). It describes the original [...] "Instant Boat" [...] technique. Generically {{known as the}} [...] "chine log method" [...] or [...] "simplified chine log method" [...] the technique consists of (i) cutting body panels to a predetermined shape as given on the plans, (ii) wrapping them around frames or bulkheads, (iii) adding chines (small section planks of lumberyard wood) along the joints (either internally or externally) and fastening them together using glue and mechanical fasteners (nails or screws). The book described all the basic techniques (gluing, nailing and screwing with some fiberglass) to produce five designs: 12' Teal, 7'9" [...] Elegant Punt, 12' Kayak, 31' Folding Schooner, 15'6" [...] Surf, and 20'9" [...] Zephyr. All these boats have single chines (i.e. have a bottom panel and two sides) and have their shape limited by the bevels given to the chines. The boats in Paysons book were designed for use on protected waters and none was <b>self-bailing</b> or designed to self-recover in case of capsize. However, Bolger designed many other boats using this building technique, including the ocean crossing AS-39 (or Loose Moose II) {{as well as a}} significant number of other boats.|$|E
50|$|Most R-22 {{boats are}} now {{equipped}} with Inner Mast Furling (IMF) {{as well as}} roller reefing jibs. The R-22 can be sailed single handed from the large, <b>self-bailing</b> cockpit. The cockpit features a flat floor bottom, comfortable seating, and an optional Boom Room. The boom can be raised or lowered, allowing the boat to be sailed with a Bimini top in place providing shade from the sun. The cabin features a partitioned V-berth, 4' long galley with stove and icebox, {{as well as an}} enclosed head. The cabin ceiling features two standing room hatches and an optional pop top and canvas enclosures. The sailboat also uses the swing keel as a self-centering feature when loading onto the trailer. Unlike most sailboats in its class, this boat features positive foam flotation that render it unsinkable, even if holed. The sturdy mast is supported by 9 stays and 9 chain plates: one forward jib stay, 3 stays on each side, and two back stays. The mast can remain upright with any broken stay, even the single forward jib stay. One R-22 boat was caught in hurricane-force winds in Long Island Sound and knocked down 3 times. The R-22 is unsinkable and self-righting, but hurricane-force winds tested its mettle. It broke one shroud and one stay, but was never de-masted and sailed back to Mamaroneck Harbor when the winds died to about 30 mph.|$|E
