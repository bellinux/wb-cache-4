30|$|The largest {{source of}} {{variability}} in the calibration factor CFdA was the inter-calibration source variance component, representing 77 % of the total variance. Thus, understanding and reducing this source of variance could substantially reduce overall calibration factor variability. This represents variance in the calibration factor that varied with different sources. One likely source of this variation is preparation of the calibration source. For example, using different volumes in the source could affect both the activity measured with the activity meter and the gamma camera count rate (due to <b>self</b> <b>scatter</b> and attenuation in the source). Longer-term variations of the sensitivity that were dependent on the collimator or radionuclide, and thus not captured in the camera sensitivity factor, would also result in inter-calibration source variability. One way to distinguish between these potential sources would be to use a sealed source with a long half-life having similar energy photons as 131 I and imaged with the same collimator. A 133 Ba source might be useful for this application.|$|R

40|$|We have {{established}} a correspondence between perturbation components in diffusion and transport theory. In particular we {{have established}} the correspondence between the leakage perturbation component of the diffusion theory {{to that of the}} group <b>self</b> <b>scattering</b> in transport theory. This has been confirmed by practical applications on sodium void reactivity calculations of fast reactors. Why this is important for current investigations? Recently, there has been a renewed interest in designing fast reactors where the sodium void reactivity coefficient is minimized. In particular the ASTRID 8, 9 reactor concept has been optimized with this goal in mind. The correspondence on the leakage term that has been established here has a twofold implication for the design of this kind of reactors. First, this type of reactor has a radial reflector; therefore, as shown before, the sodium void reactivity coefficient calculation requires the use of transport theory. The minimization of the sodium reactivity coefficient is normally done by increasing the leakage component that has a negative sign. The correspondence established in this paper allows to directly look at this component in transport theory. The second implication is related to the uncertainty evaluation on sodium void reactivity. As it has shown before, the total sodium void reactivity effect {{is the result of a}} large compensation (opposite sign) between the scattering (called often spectral) component and the leakage one. Consequently, one has to evaluate separately the uncertainty on each separate component and then combine them statistically. If one wants to compute the cross section sensitivity coefficients of the two different components, the formulation established in this paper allows to achieve this goal by playing on the contribution to the sodium void reactivity coming from the group <b>self</b> <b>scattering</b> of the sodium cross section...|$|E

40|$|Particle {{motion of}} a Lennard-Jones {{supercooled}} liquid near the glass transition is studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We analyze the wave vector dependence of relaxation {{times in the}} incoherent <b>self</b> <b>scattering</b> function and show that at least three different regimes can be identified and its scaling properties determined. The transition from one regime to another happens at characteristic length scales. The lengthscale associated {{with the onset of}} Fickian diffusion corresponds to the maximum size of heterogeneities in the system, and the characterisitic timescale is several times larger than the alpha relaxation time. A second crossover lengthscale is observed, which corresponds to the typical time and length of heterogeneities, in agreement with results from four point functions. The different regimes can be traced back in the behavior of the van Hove distribution of displacements, which shows a characteristic exponential regime in the heterogeneous region before the crossover to gaussian diffusion and should be observable in experiments.

These mechanisms include ambient atmospheric molecules that have velocities in excess of the orbital velocity which can overtake the shuttle, ambient atmospheric molecules that are backscattered by collisions with the shuttle induced atmosphere, and <b>self</b> <b>scattering</b> from the induced atmosphere.

40|$|International audienceTime-of-flight neutron {{diffraction}} methods {{are widely used}} to study the structure of liquids and glasses. The scattering nuclei in these experiments suffer nuclear recoil {{in the course of}} the neutron scattering process, which gives rise to distortions to both the self and distinct structure factors extracted from the data. These distortions are in general difficult to evaluate quantitatively, especially when the mass of the nucleus is similar to that of the neutron, such as when hydrogen is present in the material being studied.

40|$|The {{major focus}} {{of the work in}} this thesis is on the {{solution}} of the electromagnetic wave equations in novel structures that exhibit nonlinearity in their response to the incident field. These structures are further characterized by the presence of a spatial periodicity in their dielectric permittivity. The presence of spatial periodicity results in a number of coherent scattering phenomena when the light wavelength is comparable to the period of this spatial perturbation. Here we use a combination of analytical and numerical methods to gain insight into these phenomena. Two problems each involving a different nonlinear phenomenon have been considered. First, we take the classical problem of hysteretic switching response exhibited by a nonlinear periodic structure. This problem is reexamined {{in the context of the}} presence of a negative refractive index (left-handed electromagnetic structure). We theoretically predict an exotic behavior that involves an omnidirectional response quite distinct from the well known behavior. We examine the field distribution in detail and propose the existence of a spatial soliton called the zero-n gap soliton. Next, we investigate the practical problem of output power scaling in fiber lasers. <b>Self</b> <b>scattering</b> nonlinearities currently set the limit on power scalability. In particular, for narrow linewidth systems, Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is known to be the limiting nonlinearity. This scattering phenomenon is a result of Bragg reflection from a periodic index modulation induced by an acoustic wave.

40|$|The {{structure}} of liquid N-methylformamide (NMF) {{has been investigated}} using synchrotron radiation at 77 and 95 keV. The use of high energy photons has several advantages, in this case especially the large accessible momentum transfer range, the low absorption and the direct comparability with neutron diffraction. The range of momentum transfer covered is 0. 6 ˚A − 1 < Q < 24. 0 ˚A − 1. Neutron diffraction data on the same sample in the same momentum transfer range have been published previously. In that study two differently isotope- substituted species were investigated. In order to compare neutron and photon diffraction data properly Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC-) simulations have been performed. Some modifications had {{to be added to}} the standard RMC- code introducing different constraints for inter- and intramolecular distances as these distances partly overlap in liquid NMF. RMC- simulations having only the neutron data as input were carried out in order to test the quality of the X-ray data. The photon structure factor calculated from the RMC- configurations is found to agree well with the present experimental data, while it deviates considerably from earlier X-ray work using low energy photons (17 keV). Finally we discuss whether the different interaction mechanisms of neutrons and photons can be used to directly access the electronic structure in the liquid. Evidence is presented that the elastic <b>self</b> <b>scattering</b> part of liquid NMF is changed with respect to the independent atom approximation.

This model exhibits stretched-exponential decay of the wavenumber-dependent, <b>self</b> intermediate <b>scattering</b> function in the limit of long times. At temperatures close to the glass transition, where the heterogeneities are much larger in extent than the molecular spacing, the time dependence of the scattering function crosses over from stretched-exponential decay with an index b= 1 / 2 at large wave numbers to normal, diffusive behavior with b = 1 at small wavenumbers. There is a clear separation between early-stage, cage-breaking β relaxation and late-stage α relaxation.

Another measure of dynamical heterogeneities, i. e. the fluctuations of the self-overlap, displays instead a peak and decays to zero at long times. The peak, however, also scales as the mean cluster size. Arguments are given for this difference in the long time behavior.
