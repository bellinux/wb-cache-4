Despite his short stature, he is a skilled rugby player, often getting the better of Wal. Rangi's father is an {{abattoir}} <b>slaughterman</b> and his mother teaches at Raupo School. In his first appearance, Rangi considers skinning the Dog to make a fur coat. As a testimony to Murray Ball's skill as an artist, the character of Rangi grew up over the years, appearing slightly older in each book from being a little kid to a teenager. First appearance: Book 4 (April 1981).|$|E
60|$|Chicago, I must explain, {{was based}} upon my father's {{description}} of the pig slaughterings in that city and certain pictures I had seen. You made your beasts--which were all the ark lot really, provisionally conceived as pigs--go up elaborate approaches to a central pen, from which they went down a cardboard slide four at a time, and dropped most satisfyingly down a brick shaft, and pitter-litter over some steep steps to where a head <b>slaughterman</b> (ne Noah) strung a cotton loop round their legs and sent them by pin hooks along a wire to a second <b>slaughterman</b> with a chipped foot (formerly Mrs. Noah) who, if I remember rightly, converted them into Army sausage {{by means of a}} portion of the inside of an old alarum clock.|$|E
6000|$|February 9.--Was up in {{good time}} (say half-past seven), and {{employed}} the morning in correcting proofs. At twelve I went to Stuart of Dunearn's sale of pictures. This poor man fell, like myself, a victim to speculation. And though I {{had no knowledge of}} him personally, and disliked him as the cause of poor Sir Alexander Boswell's death, yet [...] "had he been <b>slaughterman</b> to all my kin,"[250] I could but pity the miserable sight of his splendid establishment broken up, and his treasures of art exposed to public and unsparing sale. I wanted a picture of the Earl of Rothes for the Duke of Buccleuch, a fine Sir Joshua, but Balfour of Balbirnie fancied it also, and followed it to 160 guineas. Charles Sharpe's account is, that I may think myself in luck, for the face has been repainted. There is, he says, a print taken from the picture at Leslie House which has quite a different countenance from the present.|$|E

60|$|But {{when one}} says {{the middle class}} will {{disappear}}, one means that it will disappear as a class. Its individuals and its children will survive, and the whole process is not nearly so fatalistic as the Marxists would have us believe. The new great organizations that are replacing the little private enterprises of the world before machinery are not all private property. There are alternatives {{in the matter of}} handling a great business. To the exact nature of these alternatives the middle-class mind needs to direct itself if it is to exert any control whatever over its future. Take the case of the butcher. It is manifestly written on the scroll of destiny that the little private slaughter-house, the little independent butcher's shop, buying and selling locally, must disappear. The meat will all be slaughtered at some great, conveniently organized centre, and distributed thence to shops that will necessarily be mere agencies for distributing meat. Now, this great slaughtering and distributing business may either be owned by one or a group of owners working it for profit--in which case it will be necessary for the State to employ an unremunerative army of inspectors to see that the business is kept decently clean and honest--or it may be run by the public authority. In the former case the present-day butcher or his son will be a <b>slaughterman</b> or shopkeeper employed by the private owners; in the latter case by the public authority. This is equally true of a milk-seller, of a small manufacturer, of a builder, of a hundred and one other trades. They are bound to be incorporated in a larger organization; they are bound to become salaried men where formerly they were independent men, and it is no good struggling against that. It is doubtful, indeed, whether from the standpoint of welfare it would be worth the middle-class man's while to struggle against that. But in the case of very many great public services--meat, milk, bread, transit, housing and land administration, education and research, and the public health--it is still an open question whether the big organization is to be publicly owned, publicly controlled, and constantly refreshed by public scrutiny and comment, or whether it is to be privately owned, and conducted solely for the profit {{of a small group of}} very rich owners. The alternatives are Plutocracy or Socialism, and between these the middle-class man remains weakly undecided and ineffectual, lending no weight to and getting small consideration therefore from either side. He remains so because he has not grasped the real nature of his problem, because he clings in the face of overwhelming fate to the belief that in some way the wheels of change may be arrested and his present method of living preserved.|$|E
