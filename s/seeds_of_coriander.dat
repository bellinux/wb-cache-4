In that sense, the whole plant of coriander is effective, and the experts claim that coriander is a good antioxidant, antiseptic, antispasmodic, diuretic and aphrodisiac. Because salinity may change biochemical properties of plant tissues, the aim of this experiment was to explore the effect of low concentration of NaCl (which can often be found in irrigation waters) on biomass production and some biochemical parameters. The <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>coriander</b> (obtained from the collection of the Institute of Field and Vegetable crops in Novi Sad) were sown in shallow, round dishes filled with previously sterilized sand and watered with deionized water. After germination, plants were transferred to pots containing ½ strength Hoagland solution. After 14 days, different amounts of NaCl were added into nutrient solution (0 -control, 0. 2, 0. 6 or 1. 2 g NaCl/l). There were 7 replications of each treatment, with 8 plants per replication. Analyses were done 21 days after the beginning of the treatment. Biomass production (of leaves, stems and roots separately), concentrations of vitamin C, free proline and MDA (as a measure of lipid peroxidation) were measured. Leaf biomass statistically significantly differed between treatments. Increasing salt concentration induced increase in the content of vitamin C. Addition of 0. 6 and 1. 2 g NaCl/l led to an increase in the content of vitamin C about 25 %. The concentration of free proline increased significantly only at a concentration of 1. 2 g NaCl/l. Similarly to the content of vitamin C, the highest concentrations of the salts significantly changed amount of MDA compared to the control, suggesting that even relatively low concentrations of NaCl provoke significant changes in coriander herb...|$|E

Capsicum seed from Pakistan, India, Turkey, Nigeria and Ghana; coriander from Pakistan and India and fenugreek from Syria Showed maximum infection of seed-borne mycoflora along with certain unidentified yeasts and bacteria. Capsicum showed a more abundant and Varied mycoflora than coriander and fenugreek. The genera frequently isolated were Alternaria, Ascochyta, Botrytis, Botryodiplodia, Cephalosporium, cercospora,Colletotrichum,Corynespora, Curvularia, Drechslera, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Gerlachia, Macrophomina, myrothecium,Nigrospora,Pestalotia,Phoma. PhOmopsis,Sclerotium, Stemphylium,Ulocladium and Verticillium. Of the different species Alternaria alternata and Fusarium moniliforme were predominant. Storage fungi like Aspergillus,Penicillium and Rhizopus were rarely found except in a few heavily infected samples. Whereas the seed-borne mycoflora <b>of</b> <b>coriander</b> and capsicum were similar, Phoma multirostrata, protomyces. macros porus and Pythium spinosum were observed on coriander alone. Colletotrichun. capsici was the only well-known pathogen of capsicum obtained. Chlamydospores of P. macrosporus were found on fruits <b>of</b> <b>coriander</b> and the possibility of the presence of stem-gall disease caused by P. macrosporus in Pakistan is discussed. F. OIoniliforme, F. solani and F. oxysporum on fenugreek and Phoma multirostrata and pythium Spinosum on coriandgr are new seed borne fungi not hitherto reported. In pathogenicity experiments F. moniliforme, F. solani and F. oxysporum caused seed not and wilting of the seedlings of capsicum and fenugreek whereas F. solani caused seed not and wilting of seedlings of ccriander. A simple Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) technique was used to Investigate mycotoxins and other secondary metabolites. Some of the toxins detected were also confirmed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Of the 1104 isolates of F. moniliforme, F. solani, F. oxysporum, F. semitectum, F. equiseti and F. subglutinans used for the detection of mycotoxins and secondary metabolites,zearaLenone and zeara 1 enol were detected from F. moniliforme, F. semitectum and F. equiseti whereas an unidentified metabolite presumably belonging to the zearalenone family was also detected from isolates of F. moniliforme and F. equiseti. Other well-known mycotoxins like moniliformin and vomitoxin (deoxynivalenol) were found in F. moniliforme. Equisetin, an antibiotic and a mild toxin, has been reported {{here for the first time}} from several isolates of F. semitectum.

Sphericity <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> was found to be 0. 757 with a surface area of 46. 167 mm 2. One thousand seed weight increased linearly from 8. 89 to 9. 826 g when the moisture content increases from 8. 5 to 15. 89 % (w. b.). The true density <b>of</b> <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> decreased when the moisture content increased 8. 73 to 12 %, from this point, true density increased with increasing moisture content while the bulk density <b>of</b> <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> varied initially from 260 to 245. 5 kg m- 3 in 8 to 15 % MC (w. b.). As the moisture content <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> increased the bulk density decreased. Also, the porosity started at 24. 284 % and reduced nonlinearly to 22. 88 % at 11. 50 % seed moisture content then increased nonlinearly up to 27. 466 % at 16. 67 % seed moisture content. Static coefficient of friction was observed lowest for stainless steel sheet and maximum for galvanized iron sheet. The angle of repose increased linearly from 25. 5 ° to 30. 1 ° with the increase in moisture content. Mechanical properties was found to be a function of moisture content, as moisture content of the product increased failure force reduced but failure deformation increased...|$|R

However, no pharmacological studies have yet evaluated its sedative effects. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine if extracts and essential oil <b>of</b> <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> have sedative-hypnotic activity. Methods: The aqueous or hydro-alcoholic extracts or essential oil <b>of</b> <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> (100, 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally administered to male albino mice, 30 minutes before pentobarbital injection (40 mg/kg). Latency to sleep and sleep duration were recorded. Results: Aqueous extract prolonged pentobarbital-induced sleeping time at 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg. Hydro-alcoholic extract at doses of 400 and 600 mg/kg increased pentobarbitalinduced sleeping time compared to saline-treated group. The essential oil increased pentobarbital-induced sleeping time only at 600 mg/kg. Conclusion: The extracts and essential oil <b>of</b> <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> possess sedative-hypnotic activity. However, it is strongly suggested that the major active component(s) responsible for the hypnotic effect is mainly present in the aqueous extract...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{evaluate}} the effect of two doses <b>of</b> <b>Coriander</b> (Coriandrum sativum), Thyme (Thymus vulgaris), Vanadyl sulfate, and Sodium tungstate on liver glycogen concentration (LGC), serum enzymes Alanine transaminase (ALT) and Aspartate transaminase (AST) levels in 15 days age broiler chickens. The results showed that full dose <b>of</b> <b>Coriander</b> (1500 mg/kg Bwt) has a significant (P≤ 0. 05) decreasing effect on LGC, ALT and AST levels, in reverse to half dose which do not show a significant effect. In {{the combination of the}} half dose <b>of</b> <b>Coriander</b> with Sodium tungstate (750 mg/kg Bwt + 15 mg/kg Bwt) there is a significant increase in LGC and ALT, but not AST level in comparing with control group. Also the same effects were seen in combination dose <b>of</b> <b>Coriander</b> with Vanadyl sulfate (750 mg/kg Bwt + 50 mg/kg Bwt) on the studied parameters. On the other hand, results show that Thyme in full dose (2000 mg/kg Bwt) has similar significant effect by lowering LGC, ALT, and AST levels as in case <b>of</b> <b>Coriander,</b> while half dose (1000 mg/kg Bwt) of Thyme show no significant effects on the studied parameters. Thyme with Vanadyl sulfate have no significant effect on ALT and AST with increasing LGC. Sodium tungstate in the full dose (30 mg/kg Bwt) has a significant decline effect on the studied parameters in comparing with control group, while there is no effect of Sodium tungstate when used in half dose (15 mg/kg Bwt) except increasing level of ALT. Vanadyl sulfate has the same effect similar to Sodium tungstate in full doses, while half dose of Vanadyl sulfate show no significant effect on studied parameters. From this study we conclude that both medicinal plants Coriander and Thyme als...|$|R
