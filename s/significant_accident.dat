500|$|The United States had {{initially}} remained neutral during World War I, but by early 1917, tensions {{between it and}} Germany rose as the latter's unrestricted submarine warfare campaign began to sink American merchants ships. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany, and on the 24th, Ohio was recommissioned. She was based in Norfolk and tasked with training crews for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{practical}} in our country’s {{industry and}} global industry that safety accidents occur frequently and major production accidents cause painful price. Reflection on the intelligent monitoring is generated {{based on the}} harsh reality. Generally speaking, the intelligent monitoring refers to supervision and control of plant operation safety through intelligent programming by collecting and integrating wisdom of an engineering designer, a plant operator and an equipment manufacturer. A valve is called the “throat ” in various kinds of pipe network systems of enterprises in petroleum, electricity and chemistry industries. Operational safety of industrial valves causes high attention. According to relevant data statistics, one third of <b>significant</b> production <b>accidents</b> occurring in the world every year are caused by valve accidents. Among the several major and <b>significant</b> petrochemical safety <b>accidents</b> occurring in our country in recent years, operators were neglectful and careless and opened or closed valves in a wrong way to cause explosion; in the electric industry all over the world, <b>significant</b> <b>accidents</b> such as electric leakage and power outage caused by improper valve management brought immeasurable losses, such as the significant Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Station Accident in USA, to normal operation and people’s property safety and so forth in industrial production. Damages and losses of such kind of accidents have brought very serious influences to relevant industries and society.

These included the Hatfield accident, caused by a rail fragmenting due to the development of microscopic cracks. Following this, the rail infrastructure company Railtrack imposed over 1,200 emergency speed restrictions across its network and instigated an extremely costly nationwide track replacement programme. The consequent severe operational disruption to the national network and the company's spiralling costs set in motion a series of events which resulted in the collapse of the company and its replacement with Network Rail, a state-owned, not-for-profit company.

40|$|Significant Workplace Injuries and Diseases in Sri Lanka Abstract: The {{growth of}} the {{industrial}} sector has been a valuable element of the economic development strategies of many countries worldwide. However in industrial operations, {{there is a risk}} of accidents and diseases that can cause extensive harm to people, and incur huge costs. The victims need to be compensated in accordance with the Workmen’s Compensation Act. This thesis presents the results of a study conducted to analyze the most <b>significant</b> <b>accidents</b> and diseases that occur in workplaces by considering the insurance claims made under the Workmen’s Compensation Act. The study classifies different types of accidents, and compares and correlates their severity and frequency. During the analysis, different types of accidents that had taken place in workplaces were identified along with the most <b>significant</b> <b>accidents</b> among them. The correlation between the severity and the frequency of workplace accidents was also established. The frequency and time have a “positive linear relationship” with each other whereas severity has a “negative linear relationship” with time. The cost per accident (severity/ frequency) has a “negative linear relationship with time. With the rapid industrialization of the country, this subject has become an area {{that needs to be addressed}} early to keep up with the phase of development. Efforts made towards reducing the rate of severity/ frequency could be a good indication that the need to gradually improve workplace safety has been acknowledged. Therefore, this rate is one of the important parameters that could be used to monitor the level of safety in a workplace. The ratio (cost/ accident) also could be used to benchmark a workplace against other workplaces. This study has also revealed that no compensation has been paid for occupational diseases, which raises a concern on the effectiveness of our national policy on workplace safety...|$|R

There were no injuries but the track was blocked; a passenger service was maintained by operating shuttle services from {{each end of the}} branch to the crash site, where passengers were obliged to walk around the derailed engine to change trains. On 6November 1909 a backdraught from a locomotive firebox enveloped Robert Prior, the train's driver, in flames. (The type of locomotive is not recorded, but it is likely to have been a Metropolitan Railway D Class, which are known to have had a problem with backdraughts.) The locomotive's fireman managed to drive the train to Chesham, where Prior died from his injuries two days later. An inquest found that Prior had failed to turn on the blower, and a verdict of accidental death was recorded.|$|R
