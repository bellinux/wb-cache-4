30|$|To {{construct}} a comparable performance metric for the direct path, we first note that half-duplexing {{is not required}} in the direct transmission. In the time occupied by one relaying transmission there is time for two direct transmissions. We base the selection between the best relaying path and the direct path on a low-SNR approximation of <b>Shannon</b> <b>law</b> in the linear domain; one gets twice the capacity with twice the power. Based on this, the duplexing gain of 2 for the direct link translates to a power gain of 2, when comparing the direct link to the power characterizing a relaying path. It appears that the received power {{is not the best}} metric for selecting between a relaying path and a direct path (e.g., throughput would be a better metric). However, it does facilitate the discussion later.|$|E
40|$|In sprays {{theoretical}} characterization, {{a difficult}} {{step is to}} find the most likely drops size probability distribution with respect to the known mean diameter and the type of atomization. The classical procedure consists of fitting an analytical function (for ex. Rosin-Rammler) on experimental data. Another more logical and more physical meaningful approach is to apply the maximum entropy formalism (M. E. F.), a widely used method which allows to choose among all the possible probability distributions the most suitable to the available knowledge about the phenomena. The classical M. E. F., states that, when given some information about a stochastic process (for ex., given the mean diameter of the spray), the probability distribution that agrees the best with that information is obtained by maximizing Shannon's entropy (() lniS p k p pi i =) subject to the given constraints (written in form of conservation laws). Shannon's entropy, besides other required properties, is additive. Additivity is not a necessary condition for a function to be a measure of uncertainty of a probability distribution. Several authors suggested some other non-additive (non-extensive) forms of entropy. Tsallis introduced a generalized pseudo-additive function: () ((1 / (1)) i q iT p k p q = − −. Tsallis entropy is applied to an increasing number of physical problems. It has been showed that generalized entropy predicts well physical systems involving long-range interactions (anomalous diffusion, granular systems,…). Violent break-up in sprays, fragmentation with high energies, leads to long-range interactions between liquid elements. Spraying regimes where high energies are involved (high pressure or high velocity) may be well depicted by power law distributions as obtained from the Tsallis entropy. An atomizer working at low pressure will follow an exponential <b>Shannon</b> <b>law</b> but when increasing pressure the distribution tends to power Tsallis law, revealing scaling. Tsallis nonextensivity parameter q may also be used in order to classify break-up regimes in sprays...|$|E

40|$|All {{multiple}} access techniques (like FDMA, TDMA, CDMA and combination thereof) {{are used to}} share the common node (satellite) for multiple users which are widely spread over a distance of thousands of rule or so. All these techniques have their own specific application, {{but none of the}} technique can increase the channel capacity dictated by <b>Shannon</b> Hartley <b>Law.</b> But MIMO is one such spatial division {{multiple access}} (SDMS) technique which increases channel capacity {{due to the fact that}} many parallel stream are transmitted from physically separate antenna and similarly there are many separate corresponding receive antennas. This not at present feasibly at satellites due to constraint of volume, weight & large physical size of many antennas to be used on Board Satellite. To counter this, dual circular polarisation is one technique which can be employed by using one antenna with a little more complicated feed on board satellite. By experiments it is found that a gain of 2 - 3 db can be achieved by using Dual circular Polarised Transmission & reception. This gain can be utilised either to increase link reliability or for increased data rate etc. ...|$|R
50|$|After the Civil War <b>Shannon</b> {{continued}} his <b>law</b> practice {{until he was}} appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Dakota Territory in 1873 by President Ulysses S. Grant. Shannon presided over the trial of Jack McCall for the killing of Wild Bill Hickok {{which resulted in the}} Dakota Territory's first legal hanging, and prepared the Criminal Code adopted by the Territorial Legislature in 1875. He was reappointed by President Rutherford B. Hayes, but his application for a third appointment was opposed by the Yankton Bar Association, perhaps in part because he was viewed as a supporter of Governor Nehemiah Ordway. President Chester A. Arthur appointed him to a commission negotiating land sales with the Sioux, which he served on for a number of years. He signed an 1882 agreement with the Lakota which was never ratified.|$|R
30|$|Awareness of {{shear stress}} values along the wetted {{perimeter}} of channels {{is very important}} in solving engineering problems such as sedimentation and deposition also planning stable channels. To study channel migration or to prevent bank erosion, awareness of wall shear stress is required. The effective parameters in shear stress values are the channel geometry, secondary flows and the channel wall and bed roughness recognized through numerous experimental studies (Knight 1981; Tominaga et al. 1989; Knight and Sterling 2000; Atabay et al. 2004; Seckin et al. 2006). Based the division channel into two subsections, the channel bed and sidewall, by Einstein (1942), many researchers used this idea for estimating bed and wall shear stress, e.g., Lundgren and Jonsson (1964), Yang and Lim (2005), Khodashenas and Paquier (2002) and Yang (2005). The shear stress distribution in circular and trapezoidal channels was investigated using <b>Shannon</b> entropy-based power <b>law</b> by Sheikh and Bonakdari (2015). Bonakdari et al. (2015 a, b) presented a new method of estimating the bed and wall shear stress along a wetted perimeter in open channels based on Tsallis entropy concept. The use of soft computing methods to solve complicated problems in hydraulic fields is expanding (Nagy et al. 2002; Cigizoglu 2004; Giustolisi and Laucelli 2005; Alp and Cigizoglu 2007). Cobaner et al. (2010) predicted the percentage of shear force in smooth rectangular channels and ducts using artificial neural networks (ANN). Huai et al. (2013) utilized the ANN method for estimating apparent shear stress in compound channels. The percentage of shear force carried by walls was modeled using genetic programming (GP) and Genetic Algorithm Artificial Neural Network (GAA) in rectangular channels with smooth and rough boundaries by Sheikh Khozani et al. (2016 a, b).|$|R
