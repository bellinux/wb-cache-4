5|$|A {{potential}} Agent Carter <b>series</b> {{was initially}} {{brought up in}} July 2013 by Louis D'Esposito, after a screening of his Agent Carter One-Shot at San Diego Comic-Con. By September, Marvel Television was developing a <b>series</b> inspired by the short film, featuring Peggy Carter, and was {{in search of a}} writer for the <b>series.</b> In January 2014, ABC Entertainment Group president Paul Lee confirmed that the show was in development, and revealed that Tara Butters and Michele Fazekas would act as the series' showrunners. Chris Dingess also serves as a showrunner. In March 2014, Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, writers of the Captain America films, stated that they envisioned the <b>series,</b> which had not yet been greenlit, as a limited <b>series</b> of approximately 13 episodes. By April 2014, there were indications that the <b>series</b> would be ordered straight to <b>series,</b> bypassing a pilot order, and would air between the late 2014 and early 2015 portions of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., if that <b>series</b> got a second season renewal. On May 8, 2014, ABC officially ordered the <b>series</b> for eight episodes, with executive producers Butters, Fazekas, Markus, McFeely, Dingess, Kevin Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Alan Fine, Joe Quesada, Stan Lee, and Jeph Loeb.

5|$|Carpenter was not {{the first}} person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was {{originally}} intended {{to be in charge of}} the bimonthly <b>series.</b> Verheiden's commitment to the TV <b>series</b> kept him from working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on. Although the comic-book <b>series</b> was intended to expand on the TV <b>series,</b> there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production schedule between the comic and the <b>series.</b> In one instance, the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs. The comic-book <b>series</b> tied into the TV <b>series,</b> the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville-related webpages, with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes' production. The comic-book <b>series</b> ended in January 2005, with no comics published until the Season Eleven <b>series</b> debut.|$|E
