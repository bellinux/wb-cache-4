5|$|As its {{common name}} suggests, it is {{extremely}} bitter, though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul the taste of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this, it is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for <b>stewing</b> it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste, a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the bitter taste has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|T. E. Lawrence, perhaps {{better known}} as Lawrence of Arabia, was {{stationed}} at nearby RAF Cranwell just after the war, in 1926, where he wrote a revised version of his Seven Pillars Of Wisdom. He mentioned Navenby {{in a letter to}} a friend at the time, saying: I'm too shy to go looking for dirt. That's why I can't go off <b>stewing</b> into the Lincoln or Navenby brothels with the fellows. They think it's because I'm superior: proud, or peculiar or 'posh', as they say: and its because I wouldn't know what to do, how to carry myself, where to stop. Fear again: fear everywhere.|$|E

Some traditional regional preparations of the dish exist, such as Coniglio All' Ischitana on the island of Ischia, German Hasenpfeffer and jugged hare in Great Britain and France.

Harvesting also occurs along the west coast of North America, and in Hawaii and New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Food {{could be}} {{prepared}} by <b>stewing,</b> baking, boiling, grilling, frying, or roasting. Spices and herbs were added for flavor, though the former were expensive imports and therefore {{confined to the}} tables of the wealthy. Food such as meats was mostly preserved by salting, and dates and raisins could be dried for long-term storage. The staples bread and beer were usually prepared in the same locations, as the yeast used for bread was also used for brewing. The two were prepared either in special bakeries or, more often, at home, and any surplus would be sold.|$|E

50|$|Corn is a main {{ingredient}} in corn <b>stew.</b> Many variations of corn <b>stew</b> exist. A simple corn <b>stew</b> version consists of corn <b>stewed</b> with milk, butter, flour and salt. Additional ingredients used in corn soups include potato, beans, hominy, creamed corn, carrot, celery, tomato, onion, scallions, garlic, various stocks, butter, {{salt and pepper}} among others. Meats such as chicken, fish, shrimp, sausage and bacon are sometimes included as an ingredient. Some corn <b>stews</b> are prepared using a roux, which creates a thicker consistency and texture. Canned or frozen corn and other canned foods such as tomato are sometimes used to prepare corn <b>stew.</b> The flavor of corn <b>stew</b> may improve after a day or more, because aging allows the flavors to intermingle and coalesce with one-another. Corn <b>stews</b> generally have a thicker consistency compared to corn soups.|$|R

25|$|In Dominica, Grenada, Trinidad, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines {{the common}} opossum or manicou is popular {{and can only}} be hunted during certain {{times of the year}} owing to overhunting. The meat is {{traditionally}} prepared by smoking, then <b>stewing.</b> It is light and fine-grained, but the musk glands must be removed as part of preparation. The meat can be used in place of rabbit and chicken in recipes. Historically, hunters in the Caribbean would place a barrel with fresh or rotten fruit to attract opossums that would feed on the fruit or insects.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the absence}} of {{contemporary}} culinary utensils such as the refrigerator, gas stovetops and ovens, the Indigenous resorted to other means to prepare their food. Upon bringing back hunted game meat, the Aborigines would preserve the meat with either millet wine or salt. Another cooking technique involved the heating up of stones by fire, which are then placed inside a vessel with other certain meats and seafood, which are cooked from the heat of the stones. Foods were mostly prepared by steaming, boiling or roasting, in order to infuse flavours together, yet preserve the original flavours. This again is contrasted with the Han, who adopted skills like stir-frying and <b>stewing.</b> Meat was also put on a bamboo spit and cooked over the fire.|$|E
25|$|Sephardi-style hamin {{typically}} includes whole {{eggs in the}} shell, {{which are}} placed {{on top of the}} mixture in the <b>stewing</b> pot and turn brown in the course of all-night cooking. The brown eggs, called haminados (güevos haminadavos in Ladino, huevos haminados in Spanish), are shelled before serving and placed {{on top of the other}} cooked ingredients. In a Tunisian version, the brown eggs are cooked separately in a metal pot on the all-night stove with water and tea leaves (similar to tea eggs). Haminados can be cooked in this way even if no hamin is prepared. The addition of tea leaves, coffee grinds, or onion skins to the water dyes the shell purple and the white a light brown, giving the egg a smooth creamy texture. In Israel, brown eggs are a popular accompaniment to ful medames (a dish of mashed broad beans) and they may also be served with hummus (a dip of mashed chickpeas mixed with tahini) and in a Sabich sandwich.|$|E

500|$|Before the {{industrialization}} {{of chicken}} production, {{and the creation}} of broiler breeds of chicken, only young spring chickens (pullets or cockerels) would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of frying, making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer. Older, tougher birds require longer cooking times at lower temperatures. To compensate for this, sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender, allowed to cool and dry, and then fried. (This method is common in Australia.) Another method is to fry the chicken pieces using a pan fried method. The chicken pieces are then simmered in liquid, usually, a gravy made in the pan that the chicken pieces were cooked in. This process (of flouring, frying and simmering in gravy) is known as [...] "smothering" [...] and can be used for other tough cuts of meat, such as swiss steak. Smothered chicken is still consumed today, though with the exception of people who raise their own chickens, or who seek out <b>stewing</b> hens, it is primarily made using commercial broiler chickens.|$|E
