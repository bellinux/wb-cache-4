5|$|Herodotus <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the Persians in Asia Minor {{heard of}} the attack on Sardis, they {{gathered}} together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability {{to catch up with the}} Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|E

25|$|Formally, {{the joint}} {{hypothesis}} problem {{says that it}} is never possible to test (sufficiently, to prove or disprove) market efficiency. A test of market efficiency must include some model for how prices may be set efficiently. Then actual prices can be examined to see whether this holds true. Usually this fails and then this supports the case that markets are not efficient. The joint hypothesis problem <b>says</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> this happens, it shows that the model is not complete. There are some factors that are not accounted for.|$|E
25|$|Photios <b>says</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> he was young, {{he had an}} {{inclination}} for {{the monastic}} life, but instead he started a secular career. The way to public life was probably opened for him by (according to one account) the marriage of his brother Sergios to Irene, a sister of the Empress Theodora, who upon {{the death of her}} husband Emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842) in 842, had assumed the regency of the Byzantine Empire. Photios became a captain of the guard (prōtospatharios) and subsequently chief imperial secretary (protasēkrētis). At an uncertain date, Photios participated in an embassy to the Abbasids of Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|In {{defiance}} of the common complaint that anti-cure advocates' ability to articulate complex opinions in writing—which some critics see as being impossible for autistic people—autistic adults such as Amanda Baggs use their own writing and videos to demonstrate {{that it is possible}} for severely disabled autistics to be autism rights advocates. She <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the critics assume that intelligent and articulate autistic people do not have difficulties like self-injurious behavior and difficulty with self-care, they affect the opinions of policy makers and {{make it more difficult for}} intelligent and articulate autistic people to get services. Baggs cites an example of an autistic person who was denied services when it was discovered that she could type.|$|E

25|$|Paul <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{he entered}} medical {{practice}} in the early 1960s, before the Medicare and Medicaid programs were established, {{the poor and the}} elderly were hospitalized at about the same rates as they have been under Medicare and Medicaid in the 2000s, and that they received good care. He says further that in those days, doctors and hospitals provided cut-rate or free care to people who did not have health insurance – “every physician understood that he or she had a responsibility toward the less fortunate, and free medical care for the poor was the norm” – and that this was possible because healthcare costs were much lower. At a church charity hospital where he worked in his early years of practice, “nobody was turned away” for lack of ability to pay.|$|E
25|$|A second {{enduring}} legend {{claims a}} huge army of knights sleep inside Blaník, a {{mountain in the}} Czech Republic. The knights will awake and, {{under the command of}} St. Wenceslaus, bring aid to the Czech people when they face ultimate danger (see also King in the mountain legends). There is a similar legend in Prague which <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the Motherland is in danger or in its darkest times and close to ruin, the equestrian statue of King Wenceslaus in Wenceslaus Square will come to life, raise the army sleeping in Blaník, and upon crossing the Charles Bridge his horse will stumble and trip over a stone, revealing the legendary sword of Bruncvík. With this sword, King Wenceslaus will slay all the enemies of the Czechs, bringing peace and prosperity to the land. Ogden Nash wrote a comic epic poem—"The Christmas that Almost Wasn't", loosely based on the same legend—in which a boy awakens Wenceslaus and his knights to save a kingdom from usurpers who have outlawed Christmas.|$|E
25|$|When the Cuman-Kipchaks swore oaths it {{was done}} with swords in the hands that touched {{the body of a}} dog cut in two. The Italian Franciscan monk, traveler, and {{historian}}, John of Plano Carpini, <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the Hungarian prince married the Cuman princess, ten Cumans swore over a dog cut in half with a sword that they would defend the Kingdom of Hungary. The Christian writer and historian of the crusades, Jean de Joinville (c. 1224–c. 1317), mentions that when the Cumans and Byzantines made an alliance, the Cumans made a dog pass between both sides and cut it with a sword, obliging the Byzantines to do the same; the Cumans said that both they and the Byzantines should be cut in pieces if they failed each other. Joinville described a Cuman noble's funeral: he was buried seated on a chair whilst his best horse and best sergeant were placed beside him alive. Prior to this the sergeant was given a large sum of money by the Cuman leaders for the purpose of handing it back to them when they too would come into the afterlife. The Cuman khan also gave a letter of recommendation to the sergeant, which was addressed to the first king of the Cumans, in which the present king testified to the sergeant's good character. After these proceedings a huge mound was raised above the tomb. Cumans were buried in their warrior outfits. Wolves were greatly respected by the Cuman-Kipchaks, and they would sometimes howl along with them in commune. The personal bodyguard of the khan were called Bori (wolf in Turkic). Like other nomadic nations, the Cuman-Kipchaks initiated blood bonds (with the purpose of symbolically cementing a bond) by the drinking or mixing of each other's blood.|$|E

500|$|The {{special effects}} team, headed by Henry Millar, {{had arrived at}} South Beach, Nassau on January 12, 1987, almost a month before {{principal}} photography commenced there.

500|$|Some {{scholars}} are skeptical the afterlife {{was a major}} focus of the cult. Ramsay MacMullen <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> characters in Metamorphoses call Lucius [...] "reborn", they refers to his new life as a devotee and never call him renatus in aeternam , which would refer to the afterlife. Mary Beard, John North, and Simon Price say Metamorphoses shows that [...] "the cult of Isis had implications for life and death, but even so more emphasis is placed on extending the span of life than on the after-life—which is pictured in fairly undifferentiated terms." ...|$|E
