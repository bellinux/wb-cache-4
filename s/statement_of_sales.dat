Bliss [...] had held that these later percentages fairly represented one half [...] the profits. Clemens, however, had never been fully satisfied, and [...] his brother Onion had more than once urged him to demand a specific [...] contract on the half-profit basis. The agreement for the [...] publication of 'A Tramp Abroad' was made on these terms. Bliss died [...] before Clemens received his first <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales.</b> Whatever may [...] have been the facts under earlier conditions, the statement proved [...] to Mark Twain's satisfaction; at least, that the half-profit [...] arrangement was to his advantage.

40|$|This paper uses a case based study – “product sales {{estimation}} ” on {{real-time data}} {{to understand the}} applicability of linear and non-linear models. We use a systematic approach to address the given problem <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> estimation for a given product by applying both linear and non-linear techniques on a data set of selected features from the original data set. Feature selection {{is a process that}} reduces the dimensionality of the data set by eliminating those features which contribute minimal to the prediction of the dependent variable. The next step is training the model which is done using two techniques from linear & non-linear domains, one of the best ones in their respective areas. Data Re-modeling has then been done to extract new features from the data set by changing the structure of the dataset & the performance of the models is checked again. Data Remodeling often plays a crucial role in boosting classifier accuracies by changing the properties of the dataset. We then try to analyze the reasons due to which one model proves to be better than the other & hence try and develop an understanding about the applicability of linear & non-linear models. The target mentioned above being our primary goal, we also aim to find the classifier with the best possible accuracy for product sales estimation in the given scenario...|$|E
40|$|The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods (CISG) {{came into}} force in 1988 when the {{required}} number of States deposited their instruments of ratification. In 1989 the relevant Australian Parliaments introduced the CISG as the Sale of Goods (Vienna Convention) Act. Through that process the Convention {{became part of}} our domestic law. Significantly articles 7 and 8 - the interpretative articles - were incorporated into the CISG. Article 7 basically has two functions. First it assists in interpreting the Convention and secondly it defines {{the boundary between the}} application of the CISG and domestic law. Article 7 (1) requires that the CISG be interpreted uniformly to promote the international character of the Convention. Recourse to domestic principles is not allowed. A new autonomous method of interpretation is developed with the aid of case law and practices. Article 7 also points to the application of good faith in international trade. Good faith as a principle is not only applied to the interpretation of the CISG as a whole but it also regulates the behavior of the parties. Article 7 (2) recognizes that the CISG was never intended to be a complete <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> laws. The members of the diplomatic conference in Vienna could not agree on the inclusion of several important principles of contract law into the Convention such as the principle of validity. As a consequence article 7 also delineates between the application of the CISG and domestic law through the process of gap filling. This thesis develops the principles and tools needed to implement article 7 (2) as gaps need to be filled in conformity with the general principles on which the CISG is based. It is also contended that restatements of contract law, such as the UNIDROIT Principles, if adopted by contractual parties will minimize references to domestic law. In response to the mandate of article 7, this thesis shows that tribunals and courts will look for a solution within the "Four Corners" of the CISG in a manner contemplated by those preparing it rather than taking recourse to domestic law. It is also argued that the failure to apply the rules contained within the "Four Corners" does not indicate an unwillingness to depart from domestic laws. Rather it reveals that a "sophisticated grasp" of the provisions of the CISG has not yet been achieved. Article 8 explains the interpretative rules regarding the relations between contractual parties. In particular the subjective as well as the objective intent of parties must be elicited in order to arrive at a correct understanding of the mutual obligations entered into by the parties. Article 8 touches on subtle and difficult issues, which are only partially solved through article 7. Some domestic doctrines such as the parol evidence rule and the rules on mistake need to be abandoned or reviewed. This thesis highlights the importance of reading the CISG within its "Four Corners" as individual articles cannot be read and interpreted in isolation. They are connected through general principles on which the CISG is based. The conclusion, supported by doctrinal writing and international jurisprudence, is that the CISG has been interpreted pursuant to the autonomous mandate and that courts in general have understood the significant differences of the CISG compared to domestic law...|$|E
