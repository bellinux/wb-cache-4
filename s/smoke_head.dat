5000|$|The 2.36-inch (60mm) Smoke Rocket M10 and its {{improved}} subvariants (M10A1, M10A2, M10A4) {{used the}} rocket motor and fin {{assembly of the}} M6A1, but replaced the anti-tank warhead with a white phosphorus (WP) <b>smoke</b> <b>head.</b> WP smoke not only acts as a visible screen, but its burning particles can cause severe injuries to human skin. The M10 was therefore used to mark targets, to blind enemy gunners or vehicle drivers, or to drive troops out of bunkers and dugouts. [...] The 2.36-Inch Incendiary Rocket T31 was an M10 variant with an incendiary warhead designed to ignite fires in enemy-held structures and unarmored vehicles, or to destroy combustible supplies, ammunition, and materiel; it was not often utilized.|$|E

50|$|In November 1832 Dale {{purchased}} a vacated lieutenancy, but {{the following year}} returned to England. He took with him the <b>smoked</b> <b>head</b> of Yagan, a Noongar aborigine who had been ambushed and killed by a young settler. He remained on leave until he sold his commission in 1835. The sale of his commission, along with ₤500 inherited from his grandfather, {{who had died in}} January 1835, enabled Dale to set himself up as a timber merchant in Liverpool in November 1835. He became involved in promoting the use of the Western Australian timber jarrah. He died of tuberculosis in Bath on 20 July 1853.|$|R
5000|$|... 2014 saw the {{introduction}} of the Warrior Mustang. Only 50 cars were produced and each was numbered on the door sill. They were sold exclusively to military personnel serving overseas. The cars came in both the V6 and GT trim packages. They were offered with both an automatic and 6-speed transmission in Deep Impact Blue, Black and Silver. Ford added the FP8 appearance package, upgraded Ford Racing Handling Package and Raxiom <b>smoked</b> <b>head</b> and fog lights. Most purchasers didn't see their cars for several months as they chose not to have them shipped overseas. There is an owners group located here: Mustang Warrior Owners Forums ...|$|R
50|$|Before {{the arrival}} of Europeans in New Zealand the normal day-to-day {{operating}} group in Māori society {{seems to have been}} the smaller whānau (extended family). By the 1820s Māori had learnt the economic benefit of working in larger groups - especially when it came to trading with ships. The larger hapū could work more effectively to produce surplus flax, potatoes, <b>smoked</b> <b>heads</b> and pigs in exchange for blankets, tobacco, axes and trade muskets. In warfare the hapū operated as the standard grouping for warriors during the period of the Musket Wars (1807-1842). Hapū would unite politically under their own chief, to form much larger armies of up to several thousand warriors, although it was common for hapū to retain independence within the larger group.|$|R
5000|$|Initially Māori {{found it}} very hard to obtain muskets as the missionaries refused to trade them or sell powder or shot. The Ngāpuhi put missionaries under intense {{pressure}} to repair muskets even at times threatening them with violence. Most muskets were initially obtained while in Australia. Pakeha-Maori such as Jacky Marmon were instrumental in obtaining muskets from trading ships in return for flax, timber and <b>smoked</b> <b>heads.</b> Most muskets sold were low quality, short barrel trade muskets, made cheaply in Birmingham with inferior steel and less precision in the action. The range and accuracy of a trade musket (40m range) could not be compared with that of a proper military musket such as a Brown Bess or the later standard issue Enfield which required the less common fine grain black powder.|$|R

As they watched, however, they saw warriors emerging from the <b>smoke,</b> <b>heading</b> towards them, [...] "thick as grasshoppers in a harvest field." [...] Just then Benteen arrived.

They were attacked immediately and {{throughout the rest of the}} day.|$|R
50|$|The rituals involve {{elaborate}} fire {{making and}} keeping ceremonies, rain making dance, and rites have involved throwing herbs {{in the fire}} and inhaling the rising <b>smoke.</b> The <b>head</b> priest traditionally was the king of a tribe, and his role was in part {{to attend to the}} supernatural spirits and be the chief representative of the Ovambo tribe to the deities.|$|R
50|$|Under Hongi Hika's command, Ngāpuhi began {{amassing}} muskets {{and from}} about 1818 began launching effective raids on hapu throughout the North Island against {{whom they had}} grievances. Rather than occupy territory in areas they defeated their enemy, they seized taonga (treasures) and slaves, who they put to work to grow and prepare more crops—chiefly flax and potatoes—as well as pigs to trade for even more weapons. A flourishing trade in the <b>smoked</b> <b>heads</b> of slain enemies and slaves also developed. The custom of utu, or reciprocation, led to a growing series of reprisals as other iwi realised the benefits of muskets for warfare, prompting an arms race among warring groups. In 1821 Hongi Hika travelled to England with missionary Thomas Kendall and in Sydney on his return voyage traded the gifts he had obtained in England for between 300 and 500 muskets, which he then used to launch even more devastating raids, with even bigger armies, against iwi from the Auckland region to Rotorua.|$|R

Twenty heads were returned to them by French authorities in January 2012, repatriated from museums. The heads were sold to European collectors in the late 1800s, in some instances having been commissioned and 'made to order.' ...|$|R

50|$|Later {{in their}} desire to obtain European muskets and powder in the 1820s, Northern Māori {{produced}} a profusion of tattooed heads for sale to traders. At least 2 different methods of preserving heads were used. The head was severed from the body and emptied of its contents with the nostils and inside of the skull stuffed with flax. At the neck the skin was sewn together to allow a passage for the hand. Then it was rolled up in leaves and steamed at a low to moderate heat until all the moisture has gone. The <b>head</b> was either <b>smoked</b> over a fire or left {{in the air to}} dry. This caused the flesh to become hard and tough. The facial features, hair, teeth were as perfect as in life, nor did they decay. Various reasons have been put forward for the rationale behind traditional use of dried dead heads. One possibility is that it was a reminder of the deceased, another as a trophy made from the heads of slain enemies. Enemies heads were displayed on poles as a macabre totem of victory. A third possibility was that it was a ritualistic way of capturing the enemies' mana, as head's of chiefs in particular were very tapu. Heads may be returned in an effort to settle a tribal disagreement but they were never traded. Northern Māori quickly learnt that missionaries were repulsed by dried heads and hid them from view. In the 1820s one European -Craik, was left with the impression that northern Māori had gone to war with the specific purpose of obtaining heads to trade for gunpowder. Another Māori offered to go and shoot some people who had killed his son if the European would give him some gunpowder to obtain heads. Māori quickly changed a centuries-old sacred practice to meet the demands for dried heads. The demand for military hardware by Māori seemed to override any older traditional practices or beliefs. In 1824 a French captain obtained an imperfect <b>smoked</b> <b>head</b> (it had been partly chewed by a dog) in exchange for one pound of gunpowder.|$|R
