40|$|A novel {{method is}} given for content-aware video resizing, i. e. {{targeting}} video {{to a new}} resolution (which may involve aspect ratio change) from the original. We precompute a per-pixel cumulative <b>shrinkability</b> map which takes into account both the importance of each pixel {{and the need for}} continuity in the resized result. (If both x and y resizing are required, two separate <b>shrinkability</b> maps are used, otherwise one suffices). A random walk model is used for efficient offline computation of the <b>shrinkability</b> maps. The latter are stored with the video to create a multi-sized video, which permits arbitrarysized new versions of the video to be later very efficiently created in real-time, e. g. by a video-on-demand server supplying video streams to multiple devices with different resolutions. These <b>shrinkability</b> maps are highly compressible, so the resulting multi-sized videos are typically less than {{three times the size of}} the original compressed video. A scaling function operates on the multi-sized video, to give the new pixel locations in the result, giving a high-quality content-aware resized video. Despite the great efficiency and low storage requirements for our method, we produce results of comparable quality to state-of-the-art methods for content-aware image and video resizing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel scene {{retargeting}} technique to reduce the visual scene while maintaining {{the size of the}} key features. The algorithm is scalable to implementation onto portable devices, and thus, has potential for augmented reality systems to provide visual support for those with tunnel vision. We therefore test the efficacy of our algorithm on shrinking the visual scene into the remaining field of view for those patients. Methods Simple spatial compression of visual scenes makes objects appear further away. We have therefore developed an algorithm which removes low importance information, maintaining the size of the significant features. Previous approaches in this field have included seam carving, which removes low importance seams from the scene, and <b>shrinkability</b> which dynamically shrinks the scene according to a generated importance map. The former method causes significant artifacts and the latter is inefficient. In this work we have developed a new algorithm, combining the best aspects of both these two previous methods. In particular, our approach is to generate a <b>shrinkability</b> importance map using as seam based approach. We then use it to dynamically shrink the scene in similar fashion to the <b>shrinkability</b> method. Importantly, we have implemented it {{so that it can be}} used in real time without prior knowledge of future frames. Results We have evaluated and compared our algorithm to the seam carving and image <b>shrinkability</b> approaches from a content preservation perspective and a compression quality perspective. Also our technique has been evaluated and tested on a trial included 20 participants with simulated tunnel vision. Results show the robustness of our method at reducing scenes up to 50 % with minimal distortion. We also demonstrate efficacy in its use for those with simulated tunnel vision of 22 degrees of field of view or less. Conclusions Our approach allows us to perform content aware video resizing in real time using only information from previous frames to avoid jitter. Also our method has a great benefit over the ordinary resizing method and even over other image retargeting methods. We show that the benefit derived from this algorithm is significant to patients with fields of view 20 ° or less. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{shrinking}} {{criterion for}} upper semicontinuous decompositions of a locally compact metric space is extended to complete metric spaces, answering {{a question of}} Daverman (1986). This particular criterion thus fits into the general framework exhibited by the other results in this area (Daverman, 1986, Sections 5 and 6). This includes particularly the fundamental theorem of R. D. Edwards and L. C. Glaser (1972), later polished by A. Marin and Y. M. Visetti (1975) which shows that <b>shrinkability</b> of an upper semicontinuous decomposition of a complete metric space {{is equivalent to the}} projection map being a near-homeomorphism...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the underlying {{structure of a}} metric space, one seeks a parametrization of a special type. For example, every Riemannian manifold homeomorphic to the 2 -sphere is conformally equivalent to S 2. In his 1996 Revista Matemática Iberoamericana papers [12, 13], Stephen Semmes gave unexpected counterexamples to several natural conjectures on the bilipschitz and quasisymmetric parametrizations of metric n-spheres. His examples are geometrically self-similar manifolds modeled on the decompo-sition spaces associated with the Whitehead continuum, Bing’s dogbone, or Bing’s double; these spaces admit metrics that are smooth Riemannian out-side a totally disconnected closed set and, in some sense, indistinguishable from the standard metric on S 3 geometrically and measure theoretically, and yet are not quasisymmetrically equivalent to S 3. Through these examples, he addresses the roles of wildness, <b>shrinkability</b> and linking in questions of parametrization, and expresses his philosophical views on mappings and spaces. The usefulness of Semmes ’ construction {{is not limited to}} the problems at hand. Work on Semmes-type spaces there...|$|E
40|$|Storability of tubers {{obtained}} from 9 hybrid True Potato Seed (TPS) progenies {{were compared with}} that of non-TPS cultivar `Diamant` under ambient conditions (22. 0 - 34. 8 °C and 58. 0 - 93. 6 % RH). Dormant period, days to start shrinkage and days to 100 % shrinkage of all TPS progenies were significantly longer than those of `Diamant`, especially in P- 364 X TPS- 67 and P- 364 X TS- 9. The results of correlation analysis among these parameters also indicated that the storability of the TPS progenies was superior to that of `Diamant`. The rate of rotten tubers of all the TPS progenies, however, was significantly higher than that of `Diamant` because of their high susceptibility to infectious diseases, indicating the importance of the selection of TPS progenies with high disease resistance during storage under ambient conditions. Tuber size also affected the storability of TPS progenies; small tubers were preferable to medium and large ones, except for their high <b>shrinkability...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{expansive}} soil shows high volumetric changes {{with changes in}} water content. When they imbibe water during monsoon, they expand and on evaporation thereof in summer, they shrink. Because of this alternate swelling and shrinkage, structures fonded on them are severally damaged. Extensive research {{work has been done}} on {{expansive soil}} but an important aspect of the expansive soil mass is the volume reduction or shrinkage exhibited on drying is appears to be inadequately investigated in the available literature. This paper includes the study of shrinkage behaviour or the rate at which volume decrease takes place when a given soil at different initial water content shrink till it assume fully shrunken dry state and attempt is made to propose appropriate parameter characterizing <b>shrinkability</b> of soil on lines of the “Limiting Unit Swell Potential”. The aspects presented here above have important relevance in predicting cyclic volumetric change exhibited by any natural or manmade soil mass. Extensive laboratory investigations were carried out on five soil materials, at different initial water contents, possessing different swelling characteristics...|$|E
40|$|A {{geometric}} fullerene, {{or simply}} a fullerene, is {{the surface of a}} simple closed convex 3 -dimensional polyhedron with only 5 - and 6 -gonal faces. Fullerenes are geometric models for chemical fullerenes, which form an important class of organic molecules. These molecules have been stud-ied intensively in chemistry, physics, crystallography, and so on, and their study has led to the appearance of a vast literature on fullerenes in math-ematical chemistry and combinatorial and applied geometry. In particu-lar, several generalizations of the notion of a fullerene have been given, aiming at various applications. Here a new generalization of this notion is proposed: an n-disk-fullerene. It is obtained from the surface of a closed convex 3 -dimensional polyhedron which has one n-gonal face and all other faces 5 - and 6 -gonal, by removing the n-gonal face. Only 5 - and 6 -disk-fullerenes correspond to geometric fullerenes. The notion of a geo-metric fullerene is therefore generalized from spheres to compact simply connected two-dimensional manifolds with boundary. A two-dimensional surface is said to be unshrinkable if it does not contain belts, that is, simple cycles consisting of 6 -gons each of which has two neighbours adjacent at a pair of opposite edges. <b>Shrinkability</b> of fullerenes and n-disk-fullerenes is investigated...|$|E
40|$|Results of dilatometric {{studies of}} bounded plaster sandmix applied in {{precision}} pressure below atmospheric casting, {{are presented in}} this paper. Sandmix composed of half-hydrate α-CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O with different parts of silica SiO 2 was a subject of investigations. Silica is a factor weakening the influence of phase transformations on total distortion of the mould during heating and thus influences the accuracy of prepared cast. Experimental moulders of dimensions 7 x 35 made of plaster sandmix with silica fraction equal 30; 40; 50; 60 and 70 % were used during studies. Sandmix was tested in raw state and after heat treatment changing the α-half hydrate into anhydrite II (CaSO 4). It was demonstrated that addition of the silica at level about 50 % influences most advantageously on dimension changes of heated sandmix by lowering dilatations 3 times in comparison with sandmix composed of pure α-half hydrate. The transformation of plaster structure into anhydrite II is also important - the <b>shrinkability</b> phase disappears and expansion similar to linear-like appears. It was determined {{that it is possible}} to obtain sandmix of small, stabile distortion on the way of appropriate selection of components and heat treatment parameters what improves dimensional and shape accuracy limits of the cast and significantly limits internal stresses in the mould eliminating risk of its cracking...|$|E
30|$|Leaf {{shrinkage}} provides {{insights into}} the potential variation of foliar SVR, within the same species, when leaf moisture content is changing in response to water deficit. Since SVR {{is among the most}} significant plant flammability features, leaf shrinkage would be a relevant component of fuel hazard assessment through its influence on SVR, enhancing—if it is taken into account—thereby the wildfire prediction accuracy. The purpose of this work is, first, to consider the leaf shrinkage by characterizing the plant species towards the <b>shrinkability</b> of their leaves, taking account the possible site effect, to characterize the behavior of shrinkage as a function of moisture content and finally to perform a classification for some dominant Mediterranean species based on the shrinkage levels. The assessment of the hierarchical relationships between the dimensional shrinkages is also aimed. Leaves and needles of thirteen tree and shrub species were harvested from six different sites in western Rif Mountains. Leaves dimensions and moisture content were measured regularly during a gradual drying at the laboratory. Dimensional shrinkages were calculated at each moisture content level. Dimensional shrinkages behaved similarly whether in leaf or timber and kept the same reporting relationships between each other. Among the species sampled in different sites, site effect is significant only in Pinus canariensis and Pistacia lentiscus. A classification of the plant species was carried out in three separate classes. Generally, shrinkage class of the plant species studied gave an idea on its flammability ranking reported in the literature, implying thus a cause-and-effect relationship between both parameters.|$|E
30|$|The salient and {{important}} information-based algorithm {{is a kind}} of popular retargeting method and could be used for preserving the visual consistency of important regions of an image effectively. Zhang et al. [2] employed <b>shrinkability</b> maps and a random walk model to improve the resizing efficiency with low storage requirements. Roberto et al. [3] utilized a reduced linear model for image resizing, in which a combination of gradient information with visual saliency maps [4] is used for evaluating the image energy. Due to the visual saliency map involving information of color, intensity, and orientation, its implementation is not quite well in some scenarios. Huang et al. [5] proposed a framework for preserving the global structure in images and vector art. Their method formulates the structure preservation as an optimization problem and the accuracy relies on robust structure detection. Wang et al. [6] presented a Scale-and-Stretch (SNS) warping method, via iteratively computing optimal local scaling factors for each local region and updating a warped image, to resize an image. In some case, some objects might be excessively distorted since the distortion is distributed over all the spatial directions. Based on the conformal energy, Zhang et al. [7] employed handles to describe original image and minimized quadratic distortion energies to obtain a resized image, but their method cannot guarantee to strictly preserve edges. Guo et al. [8] constructed a mesh image representation and associated an image saliency into the image mesh, then regarded image structure as constraints for mesh parameterization. Owing to the emphasis of relative scale of salient object, nearby objects may be distorted.|$|E
40|$|Some {{images are}} {{intrinsically}} more memorable than others (e. g., Isola et al., 2014) but the features making them memorable {{are not yet}} well understood. Based on the hypothesis that memorability depends on perceptual organization, we present two studies in which we ask whether (i) more memorable images are also easier to categorize rapidly, and (ii) whether they survive shrinking to thumbnail size better. We used meaningful real-life scene photographs from a previous memorability study (Bylinskii et al., 2015). In the rapid-categorization study, on each trial such an image (32 ms) was presented, directly followed by a mask (80 ms) and a category label. Participants indicated whether the label matched the image. An image's 'categorizability'-score was calculated as the proportion of correct responses on yes-trials. In the shrinking study, a regular-sized image, surrounded by nine thumbnails was presented on each trial. Participants had to locate the shrunken version of the middle image as fast as possible. An image's 'shrinkability'-score was the mean RT across correct responses. Most categories showed high consistency (mean split-half Spearman's ρ up to. 90) for both output variables, suggesting these are intrinsic image properties too. However, the predicted correlation with memorability was only observed for <b>shrinkability</b> (ρ = -. 22), not for categorizability (ρ = -. 05). To rule out distinctiveness as a confounding variable for the absence and/or presence of the observed correlations, we are currently quantifying the images on that variable. This additional analysis might provide a deeper insight into the current, unexpected pattern of results. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Chalcogenides are {{chemical}} compounds {{with at least}} one of the following three chemical elements: Sulfur (S), Selenium (Sn), and Tellurium (Te). As opposed to other materials, chalcogenide atomic arrangement can quickly and reversibly inter-change between crystalline, amorphous and liquid phases. Therefore they are also called phase change materials. As a results, chalcogenide thermal, optical, structural, electronic, electrical properties change pronouncedly and significantly with the phase they are in, leading to a host of different applications in different areas. The noticeable optical reflectivity difference between crystalline and amorphous phases has allowed optical storage devices to be made. Their very high thermal conductivity and heat fusion provided remarkable benefits in the frame of thermal energy storage for heating and cooling in residential and commercial buildings. The outstanding resistivity difference between crystalline and amorphous phases led to a significant improvement of solid state storage devices from the power consumption to the re-writability to say nothing of the <b>shrinkability.</b> This work focuses on a better understanding from a simulative stand point of the electronic, vibrational and optical properties for the crystalline phases (hexagonal and faced-centered cubic). The electronic properties are calculated implementing the density functional theory combined with pseudo-potentials, plane waves and the local density approximation. The phonon properties are computed using the density functional perturbation theory. The phonon dispersion and spectrum are calculated using the density functional perturbation theory. As it relates to the optical constants, the real part dielectric function is calculated through the Drude-Lorentz expression. The imaginary part results from the real part through the Kramers-Kronig transformation. The refractive index, the extinctive and absorption coefficients are analytically calculated from the dielectric function. The transmission and reflection coefficients are calculated using the Fresnel equations. All calculated optical constants compare well the experimental ones...|$|E
40|$|The {{setting for}} this note {{involves}} a closed subset X of an n-manifold without boundary M (n • 5), which is globally {{but not necessarily}} locally simple, in that it satisfies the following Cellularity Criterion (first studied by McMillan [14]) : for each neighborhood U of X there exists a neighborhood V of X (V C U) such that every loop in V-X is nullhomotopic in U-X. We show that for each CE (cell-like) decomposition G of X such that X/G is 1 -dimensional, the trivial extension G * of G to all of M is shrinkable, so that M/G * is topologically equivalent to M. This {{can be interpreted as}} an extension of a result of Sher [15] for the case X/G being O-dimensional. Its foundation is recent work by Cannon [4] and/or Edwards [10], characterizing the <b>shrinkability</b> of CE decompositions G * of M in terms of the following: M/G * is said to have the Disjoint Disk Property if any two maps f and g of the 2 -cell B 2 into M/G * can be approximated, arbitrarily closely, by maps f ' and g' having disjoint images. Initially Cannon used the Disjoint Disks Property (abbreviation: DDP) to show that G * is shrinkable, provided that the closure of the image of the nondegenerate elements satisfies certain dimension restrictions, lax enough to be readily applicable here. Shortly thereafter, Edwards developed the complete characterization in terms of the DDP and the finite dimensionality of the decomposition space M/G*. The concepts of upper semicontinuous decompositions and proper maps can be construed as naturally equivalent. To expedite matters, we deal with the latter concept. THEOREM.
