40|$|Part 7 : IT in BankingInternational audienceThis paper {{discusses}} the world industry of <b>savings</b> <b>banks,</b> a genuine world collaborative consortium, through which, from the 1950 s, the International <b>Savings</b> <b>Banks</b> Institute (nowadays, the World <b>Savings</b> <b>Banks</b> Institute and European <b>Savings</b> <b>Banks</b> Group) was highly active in introducing ICT to retail banking. In this environment, Nordic <b>savings</b> <b>banks,</b> Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, their Central <b>Savings</b> <b>Banks</b> and their industry associations occupied a separate place in European movements around developments of computerization and automation in retail financial services. The synergies in Nordic countries were {{superior to the}} rest of Europe and collaboration was intense.

50|$|A {{turning point}} in the history of Spanish <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> came after the {{restoration}} of the monarchy in 1874.

5|$|As news spread, {{other banks}} and trust {{companies}} {{were reluctant to}} lend any money. The {{interest rates on loans}} to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City <b>Savings</b> <b>Bank,</b> Hamilton Bank of New York, First National Bank of Brooklyn, International Trust Company of New York, Williamsburg Trust Company of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins Trust Company of Brooklyn and the Union Trust Company of Providence.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the Swedish <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> sector is {{analyzed}} between the years 2002 and 2010 using the Panzar-Rosse model. The model uses the reduced form revenue function {{to capture a}} relation with the factor price elasticites. The narrow geographical area for many <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> along with local presence for many years creating awareness of the bank may suggest that these banks could act as local monopolies. A comparison is also made with commercial banks as well as <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> of different sizes. Using data for 49 <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> and eight commercial banks the findings suggests monop-olistic competition behaviour by <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> and that commercial banks could be characterized by monopoly. The results suggests that neither <b>bank</b> type, nor <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> of different sizes, can be confirmed acting competitively. The only exception is medium sized <b>savings</b> <b>banks.</b> Thus, the conclusion is that the Swedish banking sector is not competitive...|$|R

Kimball also performed a variety of other local jobs to earn extra income to support his wife and children, including playing the piano and singing at local events, stringing with Camilla for local newspapers, distributing for an herbal laxative company, and clerical work for local stores.|$|E
40|$|Our {{analysis}} {{finds that}} despite the growing number, the majority of <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> currently do not make any payouts. Furthermore, <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> distribute {{only a small part}} of their net profit to the shareholders. This means that they can still build up capital even if they make payouts. <b>Savings</b> <b>banks</b> also hold significantly more capital than is called for by the regulatory framework. Finally, the regression analysis shows that <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> that have less capital distribute profits to their shareholders considerably less frequently. This correlation has intensified since 2009, even though the <b>Savings</b> <b>Banks</b> Acts (Sparkassengesetze) were relaxed in individual federal states. All in all, our results therefore indicate that payouts do not currently pose a threat to the capital adequacy of most <b>savings</b> <b>banks...</b>|$|R

This news was received with dismay by Australian fans, who had earlier seen players such as Ted McDonald leave Australia and accept contracts in the professional English leagues. To keep Ponsford in Melbourne, The Herald—a local newspaper—employed him on the basis that he would remain available for all representative cricket. The new role included writing articles for the paper.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the corner left Otto unable to meet his {{obligations}} and sent his brokerage house, Gross & Kleeberg, into bankruptcy. On Thursday, October 17, the New York Stock Exchange suspended Otto's trading privileges. As a result of United Copper's collapse, the State <b>Savings</b> <b>Bank</b> of Butte Montana (owned by F.

5|$|The {{private sector}} has {{also played a}} large role in revitalizing the area, even without public aid and incentives.

One initiative has often led to others. River Street's development into a center for antique stores came about without any public effort or intent, and the restoration of the music hall at the <b>Savings</b> <b>Bank</b> led to many new restaurants opening in the neighborhood.

5|$|With Poland's regained {{independence}} {{came the}} {{major change in}} the fortunes of Kraków—now {{the second most important}} city of a sovereign nation. The state began to make new plans for the city development and commissioned a number of representative buildings. The predominant style for new projects was modernism with various interpretations of the art-deco style. Important buildings constructed in the style of Polish modernism include the Feniks 'LOT' building on Basztowa Street, the Feniks department store on the Main Square and the Municipal <b>Savings</b> <b>Bank</b> on Szczepański Square. The Józef Piłsudski house is also of note as a particularly good example of interwar architecture in the city.|$|E
5|$|As {{the postwar}} years yielded to the Gilded Age, Troy's {{prosperity}} continued. The wealth created by its industries built {{some of the}} city's most notable Victorian buildings. Frederick Clarke Withers designed First Street's Rice Building in 1871, a five-story flatiron-shaped building representative of his Victorian Gothic style. The Cannon Building got a contemporary mansard roof after two fires. Cummings' 1870 Congregation Berith Sholom Temple on Third Street is among the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in the United States, the oldest Reform synagogue in New York, {{and one of the}} most significant religious buildings in the district from this period. In 1875, George B. Post won a competition to build a new home for the Troy <b>Savings</b> <b>Bank,</b> with an upstairs auditorium. While his building was in the Renaissance Revival style of the time, its forms and decorations anticipated his later work in the Beaux-Arts vein.|$|E
5|$|F. Augustus Heinze's {{association}} with the corner and the insolvent State <b>Savings</b> <b>Bank</b> proved {{too much for the}} board of the Mercantile to accept. Although they forced him to resign before lunch time, by then it was too late. As news of the collapse spread, depositors rushed en masse to withdraw money from the Mercantile National Bank. The Mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash from the banks of the Heinzes' associate Charles W. Morse. Runs occurred at Morse's National Bank of North America and the New Amsterdam National. Afraid of the impact the tainted reputations of Augustus Heinze and Morse could have on the banking system, the New York Clearing House (a consortium of the city's banks) forced Morse and Heinze to resign all banking interests. By the weekend after the failed corner, there was not yet systemic panic. Funds were withdrawn from Heinze-associated banks, only to be deposited with other banks in the city.|$|E
