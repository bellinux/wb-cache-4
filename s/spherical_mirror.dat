5|$|The Twyman–Green {{interferometer}}, {{invented by}} Twyman and Green in 1916, is {{a variant of}} the Michelson interferometer widely used to test optical components. The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a collimator. It {{is interesting to note that}} Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman-Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman-Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twyman-Green interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig.14 illustrates a Twyman-Green interferometer set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic point source is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex <b>spherical</b> <b>mirror</b> is positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.|$|E

He correctly stated that vision results from light that is reflected into the eye by an object, not emitted by the eye itself and reflected back, as Aristotle believed. He solved the problem of finding the locus of points on a <b>spherical</b> <b>mirror</b> from which light will be reflected to an observer. From his studies of refraction, he determined that the atmosphere has a definite height and that twilight is caused by refraction of solar radiation from beneath the horizon.|$|E

25|$|Snell's law can {{be derived}} from Fermat's principle, which states that the light travels the path which takes the least time. By taking the {{derivative}} of the optical path length, the stationary point is found giving the path taken by the light (though {{it should be noted that}} the result does not show light taking the least time path, but rather one that is stationary with respect to small variations as there are cases where light actually takes the greatest time path, as in a <b>spherical</b> <b>mirror).</b> In a classic analogy, the area of lower refractive index is replaced by a beach, the area of higher refractive index by the sea, and the fastest way for a rescuer on the beach to get to a drowning person in the sea is to run along a path that follows Snell's law.|$|E
25|$|The most {{advanced}} {{type of a}} detector is the RICH, or Ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, developed in the 1980s. In a RICH detector, a cone of Cherenkov light is produced when a high speed charged particle traverses a suitable medium, often called radiator. This light cone is detected on a position sensitive planar photon detector, which allows reconstructing a ring or disc, the radius {{of which is a}} measure for the Cherenkov emission angle. Both focusing and proximity-focusing detectors are in use. In a focusing RICH detector, the photons are collected by a <b>spherical</b> <b>mirror</b> and focused onto the photon detector placed at the focal plane. The result is a circle with a radius independent of the emission point along the particle track. This scheme is suitable for low refractive index radiators—i.e. gases—due to the larger radiator length needed to create enough photons. In the more compact proximity-focusing design, a thin radiator volume emits a cone of Cherenkov light which traverses a small distance—the proximity gap—and is detected on the photon detector plane. The image is a ring of light, the radius of which is defined by the Cherenkov emission angle and the proximity gap. The ring thickness is determined by the thickness of the radiator. An example of a proximity gap RICH detector is the High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID), a detector currently under construction for ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment), one of the six experiments at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN.|$|E

40|$|Sidles and Sigg {{have shown}} that {{advanced}} LIGO interferometers will encounter a serious tilt instability, in which symmetric tilts of the mirrors of an arm cavity cause the cavity's light beam to slide sideways, so its radiation pressure exerts a torque that increases the tilt. Sidles and Sigg showed that the strength T of this torque is 26. 2 times greater for advanced LIGO's baseline cavities [...] nearly flat <b>spherical</b> <b>mirrors</b> which support Gaussian beams (``FG'' cavities), than for nearly concentric <b>spherical</b> <b>mirrors</b> which support Gaussian beams with the same diffraction losses as the baseline case [...] ``CG'' cavities: T^{FG}/T^{CG} = 26. 2. This has motivated a proposal to change the baseline design to nearly concentric, <b>spherical</b> <b>mirrors.</b> In order to reduce thermoelastic noise in advanced LIGO, O'Shaughnessy and Thorne have proposed replacing the <b>spherical</b> <b>mirrors</b> and their Gaussian beams by ``Mexican-Hat'' (MH) shaped mirrors which support flat-topped, ``mesa'' shaped beams. In this paper we compute the tilt-instability torque for advanced-LIGO cavities with nearly flat MH mirrors and mesa beams (``FM'' cavities) and nearly concentric MH mirrors and mesa beams (``CM'' cavities), with the same diffraction losses as in the baseline FG case. We find that the relative sizes of the restoring torques are T^{CM}/T^{CG} = 0. 91, T^{FM}/T^{CG} = 96, T^{FM}/T^{FG} = 3. 67. Thus, the nearly concentric MH mirrors have a weaker tilt instability than any other configuration. Their thermoelastic noise {{is the same as}} for nearly flat MH mirrors, and is much lower than for <b>spherical</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures, 4 table...|$|R

Spherical grinding {{was conducted with}} a computer numerical control grinding machine using a metal-bond diamond tool with grit size of 15 mm. Form accuracy and surface roughness were investigated as functions of the grinding conditions. Ground tungsten carbide with concave and convex spherical surfaces was obtained with form accuracy in terms of peak-to-valley values of 0. 13 ± 0. 165 wave (83 ± 104 nm) and surface roughness values smaller than Ra ˆ 5 nm. These surfaces were also characterized with fracture-free morphology. The analyses of microscopic topography of the applied diamond tool showed that self-sharpening of diamond abrasives occurred in grinding.
