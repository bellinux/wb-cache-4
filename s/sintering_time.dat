Sintering under atmospheric pressure requires {{the use of}} a protective gas, quite often endothermic gas. Sintering, with subsequent reworking, can produce a great range of material properties. Changes in density, alloying, or heat treatments can alter the physical characteristics of various products.

5000|$|There are {{numerous}} possible refinements of the sintering process. Some {{of the most}} common involve pressing the green body to give the densification a head start and reduce the <b>sintering</b> <b>time</b> needed. Sometimes organic binders such as polyvinyl alcohol are added to hold the green body together; these burn out during the firing (at 200-350 °C). Sometimes organic lubricants are added during pressing to increase densification. It is common to combine these, and add binders and lubricants to a powder, then press.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the processing of}} thick lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films integrated with rigid substrates. The aim was {{to better understand the}} evolution of the microstructure, stress, and electrical properties of the films under constrained sintering conditions. This is an important process to understand because of the degrading effects that constrained sintering has on PZT films, which are employed vastly in commercial applications. It is hypothesised that the better understandings can lead to the development of PZT films that exhibit superior dielectric and piezoelectric properties than those in current production. The shrinkage of PZT films was examined in order to better understand {{the ways in which the}} rigidity of the substrate affects densification during sintering. This was done by processing isolated regions of PZT film on silicon substrates. These were sintered using a halogen bulb which exhibited a spot at a temperature of 725 °C and with a ramp rate of less than 10 seconds. In this way the sintered regions could be ‘frozen’ mid sintering. The shrinkage of the films was determined at various <b>sintering</b> <b>times.</b> It was found that film shrinkage had finished within 2 minutes of sintering. The evolution of the constrained films during sintering was then examined as a function of the microstructure, stress and electrical property development. It was found that the grain sizes and electrical properties increased within 2 minutes of sintering. However, at longer <b>sintering</b> <b>times</b> there was a degradation of the films. Furthermore, tensile stresses developed during sintering which had degrading effects. This work was expanded upon by motioning the PZT films in a single line scan through the sintering spot to sinter larger areas of the film in one motion. This resulted in a high control over the <b>sintering</b> <b>times,</b> which was vital as the highest electrical properties were found at short <b>sintering</b> <b>times.</b> Next it was examined if the electrical properties could be further increased by applying a compressive stress. It was found that the dielectric properties increased as a result of increased domain wall vibrations. However, there was a decrease in domain reorientation during poling as a result of the effect of the compressive stress, thus the piezoelectric properties reduced. The evolution of PZT films under constrained sintering was better understood as a result of these studies, and led to the development of a sintering method in which the dielectric and piezoelectric properties were increased.

50|$|One {{particularly}} notable use of glass-ceramics is in {{the processing}} of ceramic matrix composites. For many ceramic matrix composites typical sintering temperatures and times cannot be used, as the degradation and corrosion of the constituent fibres becomes more of an issue as temperature and <b>sintering</b> <b>time</b> increase. One {{example of this is}} SiC fibres, which can start to degrade via pyrolysis at temperatures above 1470K. One solution to this is to use the glassy form of the ceramic as the sintering feedstock rather than the ceramic, as unlike the ceramic the glass pellets have a softening point and will generally flow at much lower pressures and temperatures. This allows the use of less extreme processing parameters, making the production of many new technologically important fibre-matrix combinations by sintering possible.|$|E
50|$|These {{techniques}} employ electric currents {{to drive}} or enhance sintering. Through {{a combination of}} electric currents and mechanical pressure powders sinter more rapidly thereby reducing the <b>sintering</b> <b>time</b> compared to conventional thermal solutions. The techniques {{can be divided into}} two main categories: resistance sintering, which incorporates spark plasma sintering and hot pressing; and electric discharge sintering, such as capacitor discharge sintering or its derivative, electro sinter forging. Resistance sintering techniques are consolidation methods based on temperature, where heating of the mold and of the powders is accomplished through electric currents, usually with a characteristic processing time of 15 to 30 minutes. On the other hand, electric discharge sintering methods rely on high-density currents (from 0.1 to 1 kA/mm^2) to directly sinter electrically conductive powders, with a characteristic time between tens of microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds.|$|E

50|$|The {{preparation}} of Bi-, Tl- and Hg-based high-Tc superconductors is difficult compared to YBCO. Problems in these superconductors arise {{because of the}} existence of three or more phases having a similar layered structure. Thus, syntactic intergrowth and defects such as stacking faults occur during synthesis and it becomes difficult to isolate a single superconducting phase. For Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O, it is relatively simple to prepare the Bi-2212 (Tc ≈ 85 K) phase, whereas {{it is very difficult to}} prepare a single phase of Bi-2223 (Tc ≈ 110 K). The Bi-2212 phase appears only after few hours of sintering at 860-870 °C, but the larger fraction of the Bi-2223 phase is formed after a long reaction time of more than a week at 870 °C.
