50|$|It is in aminocyclitol class, {{closely related}} to the aminoglycosides. <b>Spectinomycin</b> is industrially {{produced}} by fermentation of the bacterium Streptomyces spectabilis. <b>Spectinomycin</b> is produced in nature by many organisms including cyanobacteria and various plant species. It is present in the genome or plastome of many plastids as the spc operon, which is usually two to 10 genes long. The difference in size {{may be due to the}} elimination of obsolete genes or the takeover of its function by nuclear genes. <b>Spectinomycin</b> is mainly produced by organisms as a defence mechanism against predators.|$|E

5000|$|... rRNA is {{the target}} of {{numerous}} clinically relevant antibiotics: chloramphenicol, erythromycin, kasugamycin, micrococcin, paromomycin, ricin, sarcin, <b>spectinomycin,</b> streptomycin, and thiostrepton.|$|E
50|$|Biosynthesis of <b>spectinomycin</b> begins {{similar to}} all aminoglycosides, with the {{formation}} of an inositol ring. The difference is the initial modification that forms the inositol ring of <b>spectinomycin.</b> The process begins with a glucose-6-phosphate (1a), which is reduced by NADH to form a ketone at C2 (2a). This ketone is then formed into a primary amine group through PLP and glutamine transamination (3a). This process is repeated again at C4 to form a second primary amine (4a). Once these two amines are present, the glucose ring is ready to be methylated through two S-adenosyl methionine molecules (5a). With this methylation, the glucose ring is finally ready to be converted into an inositol ring through inositol cyclase (6a). This can then be hydrolyzed {{to get rid of the}} phosphate group, making the inositol ring necessary for <b>spectinomycin</b> (7a).|$|E

50|$|When the {{bacteria}} with the desired, implanted gene are grown, {{they are made}} containing a selector. A selector {{is a way to}} isolate and distinguish the desired cells. A gene that makes the cells resistant to an antibiotic such as the antibiotics kanamycin, ampicillin, <b>spectinomycin</b> or tetracyclin, is an easy selector to use.

50|$|An {{additional}} intriguing pattern forming Paenibacillus {{species is}} P. dendritiformis, {{which is known}} to be able to generate two different morphotypes - the branching (or tip-splitting) morphotype and the chiral morphotype that is marked by curly branches with well-defined handedness (see pictures). These two pattern-forming Paenibacillus strains exhibit many distinct physiological and genetic traits, including β-galactosidase-like activity causing colonies to turn blue on X-gal plates and multiple drug resistance (MDR) (including septrin, penicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, tetracycline, <b>spectinomycin,</b> streptomycin, and mitomycin C.

50|$|P. dendritiformis is {{a social}} microorganism: when grown under growth {{conditions}} that mimic natural environments such as hard surfaces, it forms colonies of 109-1012 cells with remarkably complex and dynamic architectures (Figure 1).

50|$|While {{all this}} happens, an {{alternate}} pathway is occurring creating the sugar functional group {{from a similar}} starting product. In this pathway, glucose-1-phosphate is used as the starting product (1b). This is converted into a TDP glucose through TDP synthase (2b). TDP glucose then has the hydroxyl removed from C6 through a hydratase enzyme (3b), which is then reduced through NADH at C4 creating a new product (4b). With this ketone present, PLP and glutamine can come in to convert it to a primary amine (5b) which can then be removed through a deaminase (6b). This conversion to 6b is also accompanied by a double reduction at C4 and C3 through two more NADH molecules, giving the final product necessary to form the aminoglycoside. With this, products 7a and 6b can come together, removing the TDP functional group and combining with the sugar molecule to form the aminoglycoside <b>spectinomycin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{inhibition}} of protein synthesis is mediated through aminoglycosides' energy-dependent, sometimes irreversible binding, to the cytosolic, membrane-associated bacterial ribosome (image at right). (Aminoglycosides first cross bacterial cell walls—lipopolysaccharide in gram-negative bacteria—and cell membranes, {{where they are}} actively transported.) While specific steps in protein synthesis affected may vary somewhat between specific aminoglycoside agents, as can their affinity and degree of binding, aminoglycoside presence in the cytosol generally disturbs peptide elongation at the 30S ribosomal subunit, giving rise to inaccurate mRNA translation and therefore biosynthesis of proteins that are truncated, or bear altered amino acid compositions at particular points. Specifically, binding impairs translational proofreading leading to misreading of the RNA message, premature termination, or both, and so to inaccuracy of the translated protein product. The subset of aberrant proteins that are incorporated into the bacterial cell membrane may then lead to changes in its permeability and then to [...] "further stimulation of aminoglycoside transport". The amino-sugar portion of this class of molecules (e.g., the 2-deoxystreptamine in kanamycins, gentamicins, and tobramycin, see above) are implicated in the association of the small molecule with ribosomal structures {{that lead to the}} infidelities in translation (ibid.). Inhibition of ribosomal translocation—i.e., movement of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A- to the P-site—has also been suggested. (<b>Spectinomycin,</b> a related but distinct chemical structure class often discussed with aminoglycosides, does not induce mRNA misreading and is generally not bactericidal.) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{resistance}} (R) factor- containing {{strain of}} Escherichia coli {{which is known}} to inactivate streptomycin by adenylylation {{has been shown to}} be <b>spectinomycin</b> resistant. An osmotic shockate of this strain catalyzes the formation of the biologically inactive <b>spectinomycin</b> adenylate, in which the adenylyl residue is probably attached to a d-threo methylamino alcohol moiety of <b>spectinomycin.</b> Both the streptomycin and <b>spectinomycin</b> adenylylating activities show the same temperature inactivation profile, and both are present in a protein fraction purified for the streptomycin inactivating enzyme. Mutants obtained from this strain which were sensitive to either <b>spectinomycin</b> or streptomycin were shown to lack both enzymatic activities when tested in vitro. Revertants of these mutants selected for recovery of either streptomycin resistance or <b>spectinomycin</b> resistance regain both activities. Therefore, we conclude that the inactivation of the two drugs is catalyzed by the same enzyme.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Previously {{described}} methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST 398 strains {{revealed a}} high frequency of phenotypic resistance to <b>spectinomycin.</b> However, {{only a few}} were found to carry the spc resistance determinant. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the genetic mechanism of <b>spectinomycin</b> resistance among spc-negative MRSA ST 398 strains. METHODS: Nine spectinomycin-resistant, but spc-negative, MRSA ST 398 strains were analysed. The strains were screened for carriage of the spw gene and tested for the presence of transferrable <b>spectinomycin</b> resistance. Plasmid DNA was isolated from all strains and used in transformation assays. The plasmid identified as mediating resistance to <b>spectinomycin</b> was fully sequenced. The function of the novel <b>spectinomycin</b> resistance gene was confirmed by restriction digest inactivation and its distribution was determined using a PCR assay. RESULTS: A single MRSA ST 398 strain was spw positive. The remaining strains carried a plasmid that mediated resistance to <b>spectinomycin.</b> Sequence analysis of a single plasmid, termed pDJ 91 S, revealed that it was 3928 bp in size and contained three open reading frames: a novel <b>spectinomycin</b> resistance gene, designated spd, as well as a repN gene and a rec gene. The XmnI digest inactivation of the spd gene resulted in a 4 -fold decrease in <b>spectinomycin</b> MIC. The spd gene was detected in seven other spectinomycin-resistant MRSA ST 398 strains that carried a plasmid comparable in size to pDJ 91 S.
