25|$|In the 80s and 90s before {{broadband}} Internet access became widely available, bootlegs (CD-Rs or Compact Cassette copies) circulated mostly via <b>snail</b> <b>mail.</b> Today, {{all of the}} unauthorised Led Zeppelin {{material is}} available on the Internet, mostly on BitTorrent resources in lossless media formats. Decoding and redistributing audio in lossy formats (such as MP3) is strongly frowned upon among the trading community as it diminishes the quality of the audio and can make it difficult for recipients to know if they are receiving the best available copy. During the 2000s, previously uncirculated audience recordings surfaced mostly on the BitTorrent resources.|$|E
500|$|Following the tour, {{the band}} {{continued}} {{their search for}} a permanent drummer, and sought solicitation via demo tape and <b>snail</b> <b>mail.</b> Interested fans sent video recordings of renditions of the songs [...] "Disciple," [...] "God Send Death," [...] "Stain of Mind," [...] "Angel of Death", [...] "Postmortem/Raining Blood," [...] "South of Heaven," [...] "War Ensemble," [...] and [...] "Seasons in the Abyss"; complete with résumés. The band listened to hundreds of demo tapes, and created a [...] "good pile" [...] and [...] "ungood pile," [...] though the [...] "ungood" [...] was much larger. Those whose performances the band were pleased with were offered an audition in Dallas, San Francisco or Peoria, Illinois; many applicants, however, were unable to attend due to flight costs. The band auditioned roughly two to three drummers a day, and their top choice was one of Lombardo's recommendations. However, the band ultimately returned to Lombardo after deciding {{that they could not}} find a drummer who suited the job; Lombardo re-joined Slayer and attended music festivals worldwide to promote God Hates Us All and record drums on the 2006 album Christ Illusion.|$|E
40|$|Popularity of {{distance}} learning programs {{has increased in}} the recent years, with more students opting to study {{from the comfort of}} their home or workplace. The early implementation {{of distance}} learning programs involved the distribution of study materials to remote students by using of <b>snail</b> <b>mails</b> and organizing optional class room and test sessions at preferable locations. However, with advent of the Internet era, student could leverage the real benefits of distance learning.

These devices provide a mobilized study environment and have lead {{to the development of a}} new field of research, known as m-learning. M-Learning is the study which explores the ways in which mobile devices can be integrated and used in an existing eLearning scenario. Numerous universities are working towards the goals of m-learning. Apple’s new generation digital music player, the iPod, is the latest addition to the distance learning toolkit. This paper presents an overview of the current technological used in promoting m-learning, without delving into intricacies of individual projects.

40|$|Reading in the 21 st century {{networked}} {{society is}} no longer confined to print reading. The printed publications were the main medium for traditional reading culture. The Internet has come to forefront that changes the traditional reading habits of the readers. People nowadays tend to rely more on electronic-based resources (such as e-books, e-papers, e-zines, e-journals, e-mails, e-videos, e-games, e-images, e-maps, e-cards, etc.) than paper based resources (such as books, newspapers, magazines, journals, letters, <b>snail</b> <b>mails,</b> cards and postcards, pictures, etc.). These electronic sources have, fully or partially, entered in reading habits of the netizens. The youth especially students, who have opened their eyes in full bloom of electronic revolution, adopt these sources most of all. This close association of students and Internet is supposed to greatly influence their reading culture. Therefore, the study has been conducted with the purpose to identify the impact of Internet on reading habits of the Net generation students. The student population belongs to the colleges of the Kashmir Valley, Jammu & Kashmir (India). The survey method was used {{to conduct the study}} and questionnaire was used as a data collection tool. The stratified random sampling technique was employed to choose the students. The results of study reveal that Internet has increased access to information, use of foreign sources, contacts with worldwide readers and time spent on reading, and have decreased dependence on print sources, contacts with print sources, reading in local languages and reading of books. Hence, the conclusion can be drawn that Internet is a mixed blessing for traditional reading culture...|$|R
