25|$|Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) {{coined the}} term and {{attempted}} to define its scope in his two volume work Synergetics. His oeuvre inspired many researchers to tackle branches of synergetics. Three examples: Haken explored self-organizing structures of open systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium, Amy Edmondson explored tetrahedral and icosahedral geometry, Stafford Beer tackled geodesics {{in the context of}} <b>social</b> <b>dynamics,</b> and Nystrom proposed a theory of computational cosmography. Many other researchers toil today on aspects of Synergetics, though many deliberately distance themselves from Fuller's broad all-encompassing definition, given its problematic attempt to differentiate and relate all aspects of reality including the ideal and the physically realized, the container and the contained, the one and the many, the observer and the observed, the human microcosm and the universal macrocosm.|$|E

Among the most vocal chapters against the policy were the University of Virginia chapter, where a faction split off from Phi Delta Theta and chose to form a separate local fraternity known as the Phi Society, and the University of the South chapter, which formed the Phi Society of 1883 rather than adopt the policy. Phi Delta Theta returned to the University of Virginia one year later and formed a new chapter. Phi Delta Theta has not returned to the University of the South.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} theory of <b>social</b> capital <b>dynamics.</b> In particular, we examine how {{individuals}} in an organization respond to events such as performance evaluations by changing the way they interact with their contacts. We argue that positive performance feedback from supervisors increases levels of self-efficacy and results in increased utilization of new and existing social capital (i. e., forming new ties and increasing interactions with existing ties) while negative feedback decreases self-efficacy resulting in an individual reallocating their social capital utilization to concentrate on {{a small number of}} existing frequently accessed ties (i. e., decreasing interactions with some contacts while increasing interactions with others). Our arguments clarify the role of individual agency in <b>social</b> capital <b>dynamics</b> as well as highlighting the part that individual performance evaluations can play in the evolving structure of social networks. To test our hypotheses, we use a longitudinal social network data set collected over a six-year period in the IT department of a global engineering firm. Using fixed effects panel regression models, we find support for our hypotheses, suggesting that performance feedback is a determinant factor in <b>social</b> capital <b>dynamics...</b>|$|R

In fact, there are two distinct processes that may generate a persistence of social exclusion: heterogeneity (individuals are heterogeneous with respect to some observed and/or unobserved adverse characteristics that are relevant for the chance of experiencing social exclusion and persistence over time) and true state of dependence (experiencing social exclusion in a specific time period, in itself, increases the probability of undergoing social exclusion in subsequent periods). Distinguishing between the two processes is crucial since the policy implications are very different. <b>Social</b> Exclusion, <b>Dynamics,</b> Persistence, Heterogeneity, Discrete panel data...|$|R
40|$|The {{corporation}} is a constitutive element of modern capitalism. In its contemporary form, the corporation {{comes with a}} striking legal feature: ownership is associated with limited liability. Today, {{we take for granted}} both the principle of limited liability and its association with the corporate form. Not so long ago, though, in the mid- 19 th century, the principle of limited liability was highly contentious, generating heated discussions and debates. This article explores the <b>social</b> movement <b>dynamics</b> that crystallized around the principle of limited liability in 19 th-century England – intense framing strategies and politics of signification, collective articulation of resources and mobilization tactics as well as opportunistic use of dynamic opportunities. Interestingly, <b>social</b> movement <b>dynamics</b> did not imply in this case the structuration of a unitary social movement but involved instead a stunning ‘coalition of the unlikely’. Two strikingly different groups championed limited liability on distinct grounds – ‘enfranchisement of men’ against ‘enfranchisement of capital’. In the end, the latter framing imposed itself and debates found a resolution in the formal institutionalization of limited liability as a constitutive legal feature of incorporation. Altogether, these <b>social</b> movement <b>dynamics</b> proved highly consequential – marking {{a turning point in the}} history of capitalism, with profound implications for our contemporary understanding of responsibility in economic life...|$|R
