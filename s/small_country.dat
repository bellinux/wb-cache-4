Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has a banking tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. It was also seen as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as {{the former head of the}} Bundesbank Karl Otto Pöhl, favoured a <b>small</b> <b>country</b> with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions, others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs in the years to come.|$|E
5|$|Honoré IV died {{shortly after}} his throne was {{restored}} to him, and structural restoration of the palace began under Honoré V and was continued {{after his death in}} 1841 by his brother Prince Florestan. However, by the time of Florestan's accession, Monaco was once again experiencing political tensions caused by financial problems. These resulted from its position as a protectorate of Sardinia, the country to which it had been ceded by France following the end of the Napoleonic wars. Florestan, an eccentric (he had been a professional actor), left the running of Monaco to his wife, Maria Caroline Gibert de Lametz. Despite her attempts to rule, her husband's people were once again in revolt. In an attempt to ease the volatile situation Florestan ceded power to his son Charles, but this came too late to appease the Monégasques. Menton and Roquebrune broke away from Monaco, leaving the Grimaldi's already <b>small</b> <b>country</b> hugely diminished—little more than Monte Carlo.|$|E

In April, after Germany occupied Denmark, a Lithuanian envoy in Moscow reported rising hostility from Russian diplomats. During May, while the Battle of France was in full swing, the Soviets intensified their rhetoric and diplomatic pressure. On May 16, shortly after the German invasion of Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands, Soviet official newspaper Izvestia published an article warning that it was naive for a <b>small</b> <b>country</b> to attempt neutrality while giants were fighting for survival. Between May 18 and May 25, Russian soldiers moved some military equipment from Vilnius to Gaižiūnai, a location {{much closer to the}} government seat in Kaunas. The action's proximity to the then-capital carried symbolic weight.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{incorporates}} {{the influence of}} interest groups into the asymmet-ric tax competition model to explain the phenomenon that <b>small</b> <b>countries</b> do not necessarily set lower capital tax rates than large countries. In addition to the effi-ciency effect considered by the standard model, which leads the <b>smaller</b> <b>country</b> to set a lower capital tax rate, this present paper also takes account of the political effect arising from lobbying. We show that the <b>smaller</b> <b>country</b> may face less downward po-litical pressure. If the political effect outweighs the efficiency effect, then the <b>smaller</b> <b>country</b> sets a higher tax rate than the larger country. This result has several welfare implications, which are {{in contrast to the}} conventional consequences...|$|R
