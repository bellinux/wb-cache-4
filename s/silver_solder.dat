25|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>solder</b> is {{also used}} in {{manufacturing}} to join metal parts that cannot be welded. The alloys used for these purposes contain {{a high proportion of}} silver (up to 40%), and may also contain cadmium.|$|E
50|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>solder</b> is {{somewhat}} {{absorbed by the}} surrounding metal, resulting in a joint that is actually stronger than the metal being joined. The metal being joined must be perfectly flush, as <b>silver</b> <b>solder</b> cannot normally {{be used as a}} filler and will not fill gaps.|$|E
50|$|The pin brazing {{technique}} is based primarily upon Electric-arc silver soldering using {{a specially designed}} portable pin brazing unit, a hollow brazing pin containing <b>silver</b> <b>solder</b> and flux.|$|E
50|$|Other {{methods to}} prevent fraying include soft or <b>silver</b> <b>soldering</b> the wire ends, or ideally by flash cutting the wires.|$|R
50|$|These alloys {{adhere to}} lead-tin, tin, and <b>silver</b> <b>solders.</b> Other metals, {{including}} copper, molybdenum, nickel, and steel can be spot-welded to the FerNiCo alloys forming low resistance electrical connections.|$|R

50|$|Different {{equipment}} is usually required since {{a soldering iron}} cannot achieve high enough temperatures for hard soldering or brazing. Brazing filler metal is stronger than <b>silver</b> <b>solder,</b> which is stronger than lead-based soft solder. Brazing solders are formulated primarily for strength, <b>silver</b> <b>solder</b> is used by jewelers to protect the precious metal and by machinists and refrigeration technicians for its tensile strength but lower melting temperature than brazing, and the primary benefit of soft solder is the low temperature used (to prevent heat damage to electronic components and insulation).|$|E
50|$|Moser's {{frames are}} unique among Italian racing {{bicycles}} for being fillet brazed using <b>silver</b> <b>solder</b> {{rather than using}} lugs with brass brazing; <b>silver</b> <b>solder</b> never gets hot enough to weaken the tubing and thus bicycles constructed in this manner {{do not need to}} be reinforced with lugs, thus reducing the bicycle's weight. After brazing, each frame is hand filed and aligned on a digital alignment table. The smooth lines resulting from the lack of lugs are emphasized with a unicrown fork and an integrated seatpost, attached by an expander bolt in a manner similar to the handlebar stem.|$|E

5000|$|A {{version was}} also sold to Griffin and George who {{distributed}} it {{to schools and}} educational purposes. These engines carried an extra G&G decal. (A badged SP4 version can also be found). It was not <b>silver</b> <b>soldered.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cadmium is an {{extremely}} toxic metal commonly found in industrial workplaces, particularly where any ore is being processed or smelted. Several deaths from acute exposure have occurred among welders who have unsuspectingly welded on cadmium-containing alloys or with <b>silver</b> <b>solders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jewelry components, {{machine tools}} and some {{refrigeration}} and plumbing components are often assembled and repaired by the higher temperature <b>silver</b> <b>soldering</b> process. Small mechanical parts are often soldered or brazed as well. Soldering {{is also used}} to join lead came and copper foil in stained glass work.|$|R
50|$|Some acetylides are {{notoriously}} explosive. Formation of acetylides poses a risk in handling of gaseous acetylene in presence of metals such as mercury, silver or copper, or alloys with their high content (brass, bronze, <b>silver</b> <b>solder).</b>|$|E
50|$|When <b>silver</b> <b>solder</b> melts, {{it tends}} to flow towards the area of {{greatest}} heat. Jewelers can somewhat control the direction the solder moves by leading it with a torch; it will even sometimes run straight up along a seam.|$|E
50|$|The sheets were {{soldered}} using <b>silver</b> <b>solder</b> or {{some other}} brazing alloy. This technique joined the metals, but is difficult to perfect, particularly on larger sheets. Flux inclusions could be trapped or bubbles could form. Commonly, imperfections need to be cut out, and the metal re-soldered.|$|E

Caption: "NEW EXHIBITION: Among sculptures {{attracting}} interest in the Science and Arts Foundation galleries of the Oklahoma Art Center are Joseph Taylor's "Torso" in tropical wood; his "Tigress and Cubs" of volcanic tufa, and James Henkle's <b>silver</b> <b>soldered</b> abstraction, "Apollo. ...|$|R
50|$|Soft {{soldering}} {{is characterized}} by having a melting point of the filler metal below approximately , whereas <b>silver</b> <b>soldering</b> and brazing use higher temperatures, typically requiring a flame or carbon arc torch to achieve the melting of the filler. Soft solder filler metals are typically alloys (often containing lead) that have liquidus temperatures below 350 °C.|$|R
50|$|Another {{difference}} between brazing and soldering {{is how the}} solder is applied. In brazing, one generally uses rods that are touched to the joint while being heated. With <b>silver</b> <b>soldering,</b> small pieces of solder wire are placed onto the metal prior to heating. A flux, often made of boric acid and denatured alcohol, is used to keep the metal and solder clean and to prevent the solder from moving before it melts.|$|R
50|$|Welders are {{commonly}} {{exposed to the}} substances that cause metal fume fever from the base metal, plating, or filler. Brazing and soldering can also cause metal poisoning due to exposure to lead, zinc, copper, or cadmium. In extreme cases, cadmium (present in some older <b>silver</b> <b>solder</b> alloys) can cause loss of consciousness.|$|E
50|$|Silver brazed diamond blades' diamond {{segments}} are brazed to {{the steel}} core using a <b>silver</b> <b>solder.</b> These blades {{can only be}} used in wet cuttings. If they are used in dry cuttings, the <b>silver</b> <b>solder</b> may melt and the segments can break from the steel core and become a serious safety hazard. A laser melts and combines the metal of the diamond segment and the steel core creating a stronger weld, which can hold the segments even in high temperatures, meaning that laser welded diamond blades {{can be used to}} cut many types of stone without water cooling. However, when cutting very hard or abrasive materials, e.g., concrete containing reinforcing rebar, laser welded diamond blades should also be used with adequate water. Otherwise, it is possible for the diamond segment itself to break or the steel core below the segment to wear and break, creating serious safety hazards.|$|E
50|$|Black oxide or {{blackening}} is {{a conversion}} coating for ferrous materials, stainless steel, copper and copper based alloys, zinc, powdered metals, and <b>silver</b> <b>solder.</b> It {{is used to}} add mild corrosion resistance, for appearance and to minimize light reflection. To achieve maximal corrosion resistance the black oxide must be impregnated with oil or wax. One of its advantages over other coatings is its minimal buildup.|$|E
50|$|Cobra probes come in three-, four-, and five-hole configurations, {{the former}} used for {{two-dimensional}} flow measurement, {{the latter two}} for three-dimensional flow measurement. In the three-hole kind of instrument, there are two yaw direction tubes which are chamfered and <b>silver</b> <b>soldered</b> symmetrically on {{the two sides of}} a pitot tube. It is otherwise similar to the other kinds of yawmeters. In the four- and five-hole configurations, the central pitot tube is surrounded by three or four chamfered tubes, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Silver alloys are {{required}} to be soft and malleable when applying forming, shaping and drawing processes. However, {{it is important that}} finished articles are hard and durable so that the metal is not vulnerable to damage from scratching, denting and deformation. This patent application covers the unique precipitation/heat-hardening properties that germanium imparts to sterling silver. Simple heat treatments at temperatures achievable in domestic ovens can significantly increase the hardness and durability of the Argentium Silver alloys. Unlike traditional Sterling Silver, the simple heat-hardening process does not require rapidly cooling (quenching) the metal from red-hot temperatures - this means that even soldered and delicate items can be heat-hardened easily after construction. One practical outcome of this work is in musical instruments. For example, Argentium Silver flute production in the USA demonstrates the benefits. Traditional Sterling Silver flutes are constructed using low-temperature lead/tin solders, as the higher temperatures required for <b>silver</b> <b>solders</b> would irreversibly soften the instrument. The low-temperature solders can, however, break down over time and leak air, which is detrimental to the performance of the instrument. Argentium Silver flutes by Landell Flutes (USA) are constructed using <b>silver</b> <b>solders</b> and a simple heat-hardening procedure after construction, ensuring durability and enhancing the performance, projection and sound of the instrument.

50|$|Brazing (sometimes {{known as}} <b>silver</b> <b>soldering</b> or hard soldering) {{requires}} {{a much higher}} temperature than soft soldering, sometimes over 850 °C. As well as removing existing oxides, rapid oxidation of the metal at the elevated temperatures has to be avoided. This means that fluxes {{need to be more}} aggressive and to provide a physical barrier. Traditionally borax was used as a flux for brazing, but there are now many different fluxes available, often using active chemicals such as fluorides as well as wetting agents. Many of these chemicals are toxic and due care should be taken during their use.|$|R
5000|$|Each solder alloy has {{characteristics}} that {{work best for}} certain applications, notably strength and conductivity, and each type of solder and alloy has different melting temperatures. The term <b>silver</b> <b>solder</b> denotes the type of solder that is used. Some soft solders are [...] "silver-bearing" [...] alloys used to solder silver-plated items. Lead-based solders {{should not be used}} on precious metals because the lead dissolves the metal and disfigures it.|$|E
50|$|Johnson Matthey traces {{its origins}} to 1817, when Percival Norton Johnson set up {{business}} as a gold assayer in London. In 1851 George Matthey joined the business and its name was changed to Johnson & Matthey. The following year the firm was appointed Official Assayer & Refiner to the Bank of England. The company had branches in the cities of Birmingham and Sheffield to supply the jewellery and silverware and cutlery trade with raw materials and ancillary supplies, such as <b>silver</b> <b>solder</b> and flux, which it manufactured.|$|E
50|$|SOPORMETAL is a {{producer}} of brazing materials such as silver solders, copper/phosphorus, soft solders and fluxes. Cadmium-free <b>silver</b> <b>solder,</b> special alloys and tri-metal alloys for the entire industry, {{as well as several}} special alloys in the form of rod, strips, rings and various preformed. Coated silver solders with different ratios having regard the technology used for brazing and fusion technical parameters. Copper phosphorus alloys with and without silver for all sectors, as well with different types of profiles like rods, plates, strips, wires. Welding Fluxes in powder, gel and liquid in accordance with all types of alloys or soldering technology.|$|E
50|$|Other common solders include {{low-temperature}} formulations (often containing bismuth), {{which are}} often used to join previously-soldered assemblies without un-soldering earlier connections, and high-temperature formulations (usually containing silver) which are used for high-temperature operation or for first assembly of items which must not become unsoldered during subsequent operations. Alloying silver with other metals changes the melting point, adhesion and wetting characteristics, and tensile strength. Of all the brazing alloys, <b>silver</b> <b>solders</b> have the greatest strength and the broadest applications. Specialty alloys are available with properties such as higher strength, the ability to solder aluminum, better electrical conductivity, and higher corrosion resistance.|$|R
50|$|In jewelry making, {{pickling}} is used {{to remove}} the copper oxide layer that results from heating copper and sterling <b>silver</b> during <b>soldering</b> and annealing. A diluted sulfuric acid pickling bath is traditionally used, but may be replaced with citric acid.|$|R

50|$|A typical AM {{broadcast}} antenna is a series-fed {{monopole antenna}} above a ground system. The ground system normally comprises 120 buried copper or phosphor bronze radial wires at least one-quarter wavelength long and a ground-screen {{in the immediate}} vicinity of the tower. All the ground system components are bonded together, usually by brazing or using coin <b>silver</b> <b>solder</b> to minimize corrosion. These antennas have insulated bases. If required, insulated guy wires are used. Radio frequency power is fed across the base insulator between the ground system and the tower itself. In the US, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required that the transmitter power measurements for a single series-fed tower calculated at this feed point as the current squared multiplied by the resistive part of the feed-point impedance.|$|E
50|$|Bruno Cavallo, a local sign {{manufacturer}} and artist, {{also had an}} idea of constructing a five-cent coin out of chromium. He contacted Szilva, and the two proceeded {{with the construction of}} the 1951 nickel. It was to be built with stainless steel, so it would endure the harsh Sudbury elements. Cavallo spent several months forming the artistic work. The first step was to project the image of the 1951 five-cent piece against a large wall at the Sudbury Steelworkers Hall. After projecting the image, it was traced by Szilva and Cavallo over a period of two nights onto large, thick pieces of brown paper. The traced sections were then transported to Cavallo’s shop where he handcrafted the numerous steel sheets from a wooden mould. The individual parts were then fastened to a moulded girdle structure and joined with <b>silver</b> <b>solder.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{used for}} radio broadcasting, the radio {{frequency}} power from the broadcasting transmitter is fed across the base insulator between the tower and a ground system. The ideal ground system for AM broadcasters comprises at least 120 buried copper or phosphor bronze radial wires at least one-quarter wavelength long and a ground-screen {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the tower. All the ground system components are bonded together, usually by welding, brazing or using coin <b>silver</b> <b>solder</b> to help reduce corrosion. Monopole antennas that use guy-wires for support are called masts in some countries. In the United States, the term “mast” is generally used to describe a pipe supporting a smaller antenna, so both self-supporting and guy-wire supported radio antennas are simply called monopoles if they stand alone. If multiple monopole antennas are used in order to control the direction of radio frequency (RF) propagation, they are called directional antenna arrays.|$|E
50|$|The name carbide saw {{came from}} the tool, a {{circular}} saw blade, with <b>silver</b> <b>soldered</b> carbide tips. It competed with and just about replaced, solid or segmental HSS blades, because carbide is much harder than HSS. Before HSS saws were developed, abrasive, friction or hot saws were used and are still manufactured for certain applications. These processes create heat and are therefore called hot saws. However, HSS blades use coolant and the cut surfaces don’t get hot, thus called cold saws. With the unique geometry of the teeth of carbide circular saws, the heat, developed by the cutting process is transferred into the chips and carried away with the chips. The cut surfaces stay cool. Therefore, carbide saws were also called cold saws. Other names include cold cut saws, cold circular saws, cold cut off saws or circular cold saws.|$|R
50|$|Each type of solder offers {{advantages}} and disadvantages. Soft solder is so called {{because of the}} soft lead that is its primary ingredient. Soft soldering uses the lowest temperatures (and so thermally stresses components the least) but {{does not make a}} strong joint and is unsuitable for mechanical load-bearing applications. It is also unsuitable for high-temperature applications as it loses strength, and eventually melts. <b>Silver</b> <b>soldering,</b> as used by jewelers, machinists and in some plumbing applications, requires the use of a torch or other high-temperature source, and is much stronger than soft soldering. Brazing provides the strongest of the non-welded joints but also requires the hottest temperatures to melt the filler metal, requiring a torch or other high temperature source and darkened goggles to protect the eyes from the bright light produced by the white-hot work. It is often used to repair cast-iron objects, wrought-iron furniture, etc.|$|R
50|$|The term {{is often}} applied to illegal weapons that {{are created by}} cutting off {{the barrel of a}} {{standard}} shotgun. This has a dramatic effect on double-barreled or single-shot shotguns because the barrel can be cut to any length. Pump-action or semi-automatic shotguns usually have a tube magazine attached to the underside of the barrel which limits the minimum barrel length to slightly longer than the length of the magazine tube, when only the barrel is modified. Although the magazine can be shortened, with a corresponding loss in magazine capacity, such a modification tends to be considerably more technically complex, involving cutting and welding or <b>silver</b> <b>soldering</b> at a bare minimum and often large diameter square threading. Repeating-fire shotguns with box magazines do not lose shell capacity when sawed off, but they are far less common than those with tubular magazines. Shotguns manufactured with barrels under the legal minimum length frequently fall into special categories.|$|R
