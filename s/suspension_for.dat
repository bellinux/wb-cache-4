5000|$|Over {{the past}} decade, zero {{tolerance}} policies have expanded to predetermined punishments {{for a wide}} degree of rule violations. Zero-tolerance policies do not distinguish between serious and non-serious offenses. All students who commit a given offense receive the same treatment. Behaviors punished by zero tolerance policies are most often non-serious offense and are punished on the same terms as a student would be for bringing a gun or drugs to school. In 2006, 95% of out-of-school <b>suspensions</b> were <b>for</b> nonviolent, minor disruptions such as tardiness. In 2006-2007, [...] "out-of-school <b>suspensions</b> <b>for</b> non-serious, non-violent offenses accounted <b>for</b> 37.2% of <b>suspensions</b> in Maryland, whereas only 6.7% of <b>suspensions</b> were issued <b>for</b> dangerous behaviors".

Brown played 39 times for Celtic, scoring four goals, during the 2010–11 season. He was often used on the right of midfield, partly due to the form of other central midfielders such as Beram Kayal, Joe Ledley and Ki Sung-Yueng, but also because Brown is more able to play in wide areas than them.|$|E
