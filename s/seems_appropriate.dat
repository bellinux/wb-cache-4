25|$|The term {{thermal wind}} is often {{considered}} a misnomer, since it really describes {{the change in}} wind with height, rather the wind itself. However, one can view the thermal wind as a geostrophic wind that varies with height, so that the term wind <b>seems</b> <b>appropriate.</b> In {{the early years of}} meteorology, when data was scarce, the wind field could be estimated using the thermal wind relation and knowledge of a surface wind speed and direction as well as thermodynamic soundings aloft. In this way, the thermal wind relation acts to define the wind itself, rather than just its shear. Many authors retain the thermal wind moniker, even though it describes a wind gradient, sometimes offering a clarification to that effect.|$|E

25|$|Center drill bits, {{occasionally}} {{known as}} Slocombe drill bits, {{are used in}} metalworking to provide a starting hole for a larger-sized drill bit or to make a conical indentation {{in the end of}} a workpiece in which to mount a lathe center. In either use, the name <b>seems</b> <b>appropriate,</b> as the bit is either establishing the center of a hole or making a conical hole for a lathe center. However, the true purpose of a center drill bit is the latter task, while the former task is best done with a spotting drill bit (as explained in detail below). Nevertheless, because of the frequent lumping together of both the terminology and the tool use, suppliers may call center drill bits combined-drill-and-countersinks {{in order to make it}} unambiguously clear what product is being ordered. They are numbered from 00 to 10 (smallest to largest).|$|E
500|$|.....Bane {{managed to}} capture {{much of the}} ex-mayor's character: Her eyes are {{friendly}} and her hair as wild as ever. But Katz's signature grin is a little stiff, a little too aggressive. Leaning forward, she looks {{as if she might}} take a bite out of the next passerby. Which by the way, <b>seems</b> <b>appropriate</b> when you look back on her days behind the mayoral desk. Maybe monochromatic bronze just isn't the right medium for a woman as colorful as ol' Vera. Where's the red blazer? Our suggestion: Get this lady some accessories! The right hat or scarf could make that brown pantsuit really work.|$|E
500|$|The bass aria {{beginning}} part II, [...] "" [...] (Welcome, worthy treasure!) shows [...] "echoes of {{the first}} movement" [...] and avoids a regular da capo structure. The bass voice is the vox Christi, addressing the bride. The welcoming gesture from the secular cantata <b>seems</b> <b>appropriate</b> for the expressed sentiment. The next hymn stanza, [...] "" [...] (You who are like the Father), the sixth stanza from Luther's hymn [...] "dealing with {{the sins of the}} flesh and Christ's mission to redeem humankind", is marked [...] "molt' allegro". The tenor sings the chorale melody unadorned as a cantus firmus, but the oboes d'amore play with [...] "the urgent surging of semi-quaver activity". Dürr sees the expression of [...] "" [...] (fight and victory of the Son of God) over [...] "" [...] (weak/sick flesh) of man. Gardiner compares it to a trio sonata movement. He terms the last aria [...] "a berceuse of pure enchantment" [...] and compares it to the [...] "echo aria" [...] from part IV of Bach's Christmas Oratorio. The text [...] "" [...] (Also with muted, weak voices) is illustrated by a muted (con sordino) solo violin. The closing choral, the final stanza of Luther's hymn, [...] "" [...] (Praise be to God, the Father) is a four-part setting.|$|E

The article suggests that the gender pay gap is decreasing over time, which <b>seems</b> <b>appropriate</b> seeing as women are no longer portrayed as housewives. [...] However, according to Zamfirache, despite the media still projecting a disadvantageous image of women, the change of stereotypes and perceptions of not only women but also minorities suggests that the glass ceiling can eventually be dissolved.|$|E

[...] The antitrust exemption created in Federal Baseball and upheld in Toolson was [...] "an aberration confined to baseball". Nevertheless, there seemed to be little desire to end or weaken it, and given the problems he thought a judicial turnabout would cause for baseball, he cited the legal doctrine of stare decisis in upholding the previous rulings, saying [...] "Under these circumstances, there is merit in consistency even though some might claim that beneath that consistency is a layer of inconsistency." [...] Justice Byron White signed the opinion, but noted he did not concur in Part I.|$|E

2500|$|From 822, the You Zhou (within modern Hebei) area enjoyed virtual {{independence}} {{from the rest of}} the empire. At the end of the ninth century the Regional Commandant of You Zhou was Liu Rengong, succeeded by his son Liu Shouguang from 911. The histories say that Liu Rengong minted iron coins. He is also said to have ordered his subordinates to collect up all [...] bronze coins and bring them to Da An mountain where he buried them in a cave. When they had all been hidden away, he killed the workmen and covered over the entrance. The coins below have been found together in the north of China. Opinion on their attribution is divided. Although Yong An was a Xia dynasty period title, these coins appear to be the result of unregulated minting, which <b>seems</b> <b>appropriate</b> for the regime of the Liu family.|$|E

6000|$|Little more {{is known}} of the first Count of Anjou, except that he bravely {{resisted}} the Northern pirates; and for his defence of the clergy of St. Martin of Tours was rewarded by a canonry, and the charge of the treasure of the chapter. He died in 888, and was succeeded by his son Count Foulques le Roux, or the Red. From this time the house of Anjou began to acquire that character of violence, ambition, and turbulence, which distinguished the whole family, till, six hundred years after, {{the last of the}} race shed her blood on the scaffold of the Tower of London. It therefore <b>seems</b> <b>appropriate</b> here to give the strange, wild story to which they were wont to attribute their family temper, though it is generally told of one who came later in the line. It was said that the count observed that his wife seldom went to church, and never at the celebration of mass; and believing that she had some unholy dealings to cause this reluctance, he put her to the proof, by causing her to be forcibly held throughout the service by four knights. At the moment of consecration, however, the knights found the mantle alone in their hands; the lady had flown through the window, leaving nothing behind her but the robe, and a fearful smell of brimstone! ...|$|E

60|$|As this--The Captain's Toll-Gate--is {{the last}} of the works of Frank R. Stockton that will be given to the public, it is fitting that it be {{accompanied}} by some account of the man whose bright spirit illumined them all. It is proper, also, that something be said of the stories themselves; of the circumstances in which they were written, the influences that determined their direction, and the history of their evolution. It <b>seems</b> <b>appropriate</b> that this should be done by the one who knew him best; the one who lived with him through a long and beautiful life; the one who walked hand in hand with him along the whole of a wonderful road of ever-changing scenes: now through forests peopled with fairies and dryads, griffins and wizards; now skirting the edges of an ocean with its strange monsters and remarkable shipwrecks; now on the beaten track of European tourists, sharing their novel adventures and amused by their mistakes; now resting in lovely gardens imbued with human interest; now helping the young to make happy homes for themselves; now sympathizing with the old as they look longingly toward a heavenly home; and, oftenest, perhaps, watching girls and young men as they were trying to work out the problems of their lives. All this, and much more, crowded the busy years until the Angel of Death stood in the path; and the journey was ended.|$|E
