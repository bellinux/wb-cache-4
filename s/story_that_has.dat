Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club wrote positively of the entry and awarded it an [...] "A".

[...] Furthermore, Handlen called Shiban's script [...] "by far his best" [...] and noted that the melted corpses in the episode provided [...] "a striking, deeply creepy visual". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two called the entry [...] "cleverer than most" [...] latter season episodes that feature Mulder or Scully undergoing a psychotic break, due to its [...] "straight-forward thriller" [...] sensibilities.

But {{keep in mind that the}} game doesn't stray far from the formula, and the game's difficulty will put off those who never mastered Parappa. So, to put it another way, if you didn't play Parappa to death and love every minute of it, you might as well skip out on Um Jammer Lammy." [...] Similarly, IGN gave it an 8.6 and commented on the gameplay, story, graphics and sound, stating, [...] "If you can look past all the crazy effects and wild animations, the plot isn't as funny, or as cute, as Parappa the Rapper's. In fact, it was kind of bland. ... But the rest of the game is sweet. ... Um Jammer Lammy is a great addition to the Parappa cosmos... has so much more that Parappa didn't have." [...] Game Revolution also gave it a B, calling it [...] "a cool game, if for no other reason than to entertain sufficiently inebriated party guests. It's easily the most insane mish-mash of psychadelia [...] yet seen on a console, and at least deserves a shot (or the whole bottle, even)", but criticized the story, calling it [...] "the most obtuse, disjointed, drug-induced mess of a <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> ever been conceived, period."
