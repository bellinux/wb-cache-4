40|$|Abstract—In this brief, we {{consider}} the problem of tracking a desired trajectory for fully actuated ocean vessels, {{in the presence of}} uncertainties and unknown disturbances. The combination of approximation-based and domination design techniques allows us to handle time-varying disturbances, without the need for explicit knowledge of the bounds. Using backstepping and Lyapunov synthesis, the <b>stable</b> <b>tracking</b> controller is first designed for the fullstate feedback case. Subsequently, the output feedback problem is tackled by employing a high-gain observer to estimate the unmeasurable states required by the <b>stable</b> <b>tracking</b> controller. Under the proposed control, semiglobal uniform boundedness of the closedloop signals is guaranteed for both full-state and output feedback cases.

40|$|An {{adaptive}} control approach is proposed {{for trajectory tracking}} and obstacle avoidance for mobile robots with consideration given to unknown sliding. A kinematic model of mobile robots is established in this paper, in which both longitudinal and lateral sliding are considered and processed as three time-varying parameters.

A <b>stable</b> <b>tracking</b> control law for this nonholonomic system is proposed to compensate the unknown sliding effect. From Lyapunov-stability analysis, it is proved, regardless of unknown sliding, that tracking errors of the controlled closed-loop system are asymptotically <b>stable,</b> the <b>tracking</b> errors converge to zero outside the obstacle detection region and obstacle avoidance is guaranteed inside the obstacle detection region. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed control system are verified by simulation results...|$|R

Most of them are implemented by distance matching of descriptor features between the reference and the next consecutive frame image.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{technique for}} 3 D head tracking under varying illumination conditions is proposed. The head is modeled as a texture mapped cylinder.

40|$|It {{has been}} clear {{for many years}} that insects use visual cues to {{stabilize}} their heading in a wind stream. Many animals track odors carried in the wind.
