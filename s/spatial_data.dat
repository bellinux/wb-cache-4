Big Data is defined as 3 V(volume, variety, velocity). <b>Spatial</b> big <b>data</b> {{is the basis for}} evolution from 3 V's big data to 6 V's big data(volume, variety, velocity, value, veracity, visualization). In order to build an effective <b>spatial</b> big <b>data,</b> <b>spatial</b> big <b>data</b> system building should be promoted. In addition, <b>spatial</b> big <b>data</b> system should be performed a national spatial information base, convergence platform, service providers, and providers as a factor of production.

[...] Since the 1980s, he has been a developer of statistical theory, methodology and applications for spatial and spatio-temporal data. Since the 2000s, this methodology has emphasized hierarchical statistical modeling, which was integrated into his most recent book Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data. It has been applied in areas of ‘big science,’ such as remote sensing of Earth on a global scale, understanding the global carbon cycle and its effect on climate change, Greenland ice-sheet dynamics, and disease mapping.|$|E

In this article, we situate one branch of Big <b>Data</b> analytics, <b>spatial</b> Big <b>Data,</b> through a historical predecessor, geodemographic analysis, to help develop a critical approach to current <b>data</b> analytics. <b>Spatial</b> Big <b>Data</b> promises an epistemic break in marketing, a leap from targeting geodemographic areas to targeting individuals. Yet it inherits characteristics and problems from geodemographics, including a justification through the market, and a process of commodification through the black-boxing of technology. As researchers develop sustained critiques of data analytics {{and its effects on}} everyday life, we must so with a grounding in the cultural and historical contexts from which data technologies emerged. This article and others (Barnes and Wilson, 2014) develop a historically situated, critical approach to <b>spatial</b> Big <b>Data.</b> This history illustrates connections to the critical issues of surveillance, redlining, and the production of consumer subjects and geographies.

2500|$|When {{a census}} is not feasible, a chosen {{subset of the}} {{population}} called a sample is studied. Once a sample that {{is representative of the}} population is determined, data is collected for the sample members in an observational or experimental setting. Again, descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the sample data. However, the drawing of the sample has been subject to an element of randomness, hence the established numerical descriptors from the sample are also due to uncertainty. To still draw meaningful conclusions about the entire population, inferential statistics is needed. It uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented, accounting for randomness. These inferences may take the form of: answering yes/no questions about the data (hypothesis testing), estimating numerical characteristics of the data (estimation), describing associations within the data (correlation) and modeling relationships within the data (for example, using regression analysis). [...] Inference can extend to forecasting, prediction and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied; it can include extrapolation and interpolation of time series or <b>spatial</b> <b>data,</b> and can also include data mining.|$|E

[...] Introduced at 9.2, the file geodatabase stores information in a folder named with a [...]gdb extension. The insides look similar to that of a coverage but is not, in fact, a coverage. Similar to the personal geodatabase, the file geodatabase only supports a single editor. However, unlike the personal geodatabase, there is virtually no size limit. By default, any single table cannot exceed 1TB, but this can be changed. [...] Personal geodatabases store data in Microsoft Access files, using a BLOB field to store the geometry data. [...] The OGR library is able to handle this file type, to convert it to other file formats. [...] Database administration tasks for personal geodatabases, such as managing users and creating backups, can be done through ArcCatalog. [...] Personal geodatabases, which are based on Microsoft Access, run only on Microsoft Windows and have a 2 gigabyte size limit. [...] Enterprise (multi-user) level geodatabases are handled using ArcSDE, which interfaces with high-end DBMS such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, DB2 and Informix to handle database management aspects, while ArcGIS deals with <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> management.
