The article shows that respondents received different types of support, from different types of groups, at different stage of their migration, which shaped the distinctive features of their individual trajectories. An interesting aspect is the support that settled West African migrants give to West African newcomers, which suggests the existence of a regional collective identity. Limited resources, however, pose serious constraints on this type of support...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT, within {{literature}} HR SSCs {{are expected}} to move towards transformational activities and innovating activities. This research investigates this expectancy within a timeframe of 5 years and includes {{the influence of the}} type of responsibility centre. By conducting a Delphi study and a short self-completion questionnaire among 11 HR SSCs managers in the Netherlands, this study has found that in absolute quantities all type of (support) activities are forecasted to increase and hence the HR SSC is expected to grow. However, in relative terms, this research has shown that the future HR SSC is predicted to increase the quantity of traditional instead of transformational activities and is expected to innovate activities to a larger extent. When the HR SSC is structured as a profit centre the average expected direction of movement concerning the type of activity is found to be intensified, while when structured as a discretionary expense centre this average expected direction of movement turns out to be weakened.

40|$|AbstractUtilization {{of project}} {{management}} methods in practice in more extensive projects is, {{due to high}} demands, only possible with support of a Project Management Information System. Project managers can use a number of applications offering {{a wide range of}} functions in the areas of project planning, monitoring and continuous evaluation of project implementation, and final evaluation when it has finished. An important function offered by a Project Management Information System is the possibility of sharing data concerning the running projects across the project team and their surroundings. Project Management Information System applications are primarily designed to support project management, so it is worth considering how much the available applications support the project management methods defined in the project management theory, how much software applications make it possible to get support in individual stages of the project life cycle, and if this scope is sufficient {{from the point of view}} of quality project management.

40|$|Although Systems Engineering (SE) is {{becoming}} progressively the leading {{discipline in the}} development of engineered systems, most of the functions performed by a system are 'delivered' as services. This leads to what is referred to as Service Systems Engineering (SSE), which has its basis in the SE and, for specific types of services, represents the driving discipline to design successful systems capable of delivering effective services. In the defence market, the acquisition of defence and weapon systems is facing, in the last decades, a continuous budget contraction for both the acquisition and the support of the delivered systems. The main <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> services, as an instance of SSE, is to define, deliver and asses the proper blend of services to ensure optimal system performance at an affordable life cycle cost.

This {{qualitative}} study examines {{the perceptions of}} educational leaders working at secondary schools {{around the world and}} seeks to understand the support systems in place for Missionary Kids (MKs). The purpose is to add to the body of knowledge surrounding challenges for MKs as well as highlight model structures being used to address those defined challenges. A qualitative survey sampled fourteen secondary schools administrators from nine different countries. A psychosocial development framework was utilized to understand the unique challenges for adolescents. Furthermore, social cognitive theory and retention theory were used to comprehend how students learn and what keeps students in school systems. Findings add to the current practices in place to support MKs at secondary schools. Teachers, counselors, and administrators said that systems must be in place for leaving MKs to understand and talk about the challenges that they will face when re-entering their home country. These forums ranged from workshops, retreats, classes, and seminars. Additionally, parents and younger students were valuable populations to target for encompassing the larger <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> systems.

Children from dysfunctional background usually have various needs and problems. The theoretical framework of inclusion {{was used as a}} lens to study the support to the needs of diverse learners, including children form dysfunctional families, from the school part in Belarus. The {{purpose of the study was}} to understand how the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> to children from dysfunctional families carried out by schools in Belarus fits the idea of inclusion. Another matter of interest was to research into teachers' understanding of inclusion and their attitude and perception of children from dysfunctional families. In this study,I followed an interpretivist paradigm and adopted an instrumental case study design. The data was collected through the review of international and national documents governing school support and care of children from dysfunctional families and internal school documents. In addition, a web-based survey involving schoolteachers, altogether 12 people, was conducted. Teachers participated based on their availability and willingness. The results suggest that the Belarusian legislation system relative to child support meets the requirements of international laws. The system of school support is constructed on the provisions of the law and has the principle of humanism in its core. The school strictly monitors children from dysfunctional families and carries out their sustainable support. However, Belarusian teachers do not understand the concept of inclusion in its full scope and have numerous barriers towards implementation of inclusive practices at school...|$|E

40|$|Tezin basılısı İstanbul Şehir Üniversitesi Kütüphanesi'ndedir. This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} United Nations (UN) in the peacebuilding process. This study argues the UN has success potential in peacebuilding, statebuilding in particular, rather than conflict prevention and peacemaking. The empirical base {{of the study is}} the Kosovo statebuilding process from 1999 to 2008. An in-depth analysis of institution building of Kosovo political institutions indicates the UN has the ability to create a new path for sustainable institutions that lead to sustainable peace in postwar countries. The UN should cooperate with local actors in order to construct the new path and continuously support them until they become mature. Once cooperation of the UN and locals sets the path for new institutions, they will continue on their established path more with each down on that path. Kosovo institutions illustrate maturity and development in their success level based on Huntington’s criteria for successful institutions.

We provide a best-in-class repository for data scanning, along with up-to-date documentation as {{a side effect of}} coding to the API. Many large scale network applications have used dss significantly reducing the time spent in coding and in querying data. The reasons for the success of dss are its lightweight and extensible architecture, generic usage template, <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>supported</b> data domains, scalability, and speed. dss compares extremely favorably against perl, the typical recourse in the networking community, and against customized C/C++ code written to deal with specific data sets. dss has been successfully applied over three years over a wide range of applications, including large volumes of NETFLOW data, BGP ta-bles,HTTP proxy and server logs, ¢¡¤£¦...|$|R
