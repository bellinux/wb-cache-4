5|$|The Persians {{finally arrived}} off the {{southern}} tip of Euboea, at Karystos. The citizens of Karystos refused to give hostages to the Persians, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> besieged, and their land ravaged, until they submitted to the Persians.|$|E
5|$|The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, {{like the}} marginocephalians, theropods and lambeosaurines, {{may have been}} too fragile to be used for active defense, and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> likely used for sexual or {{aggressive}} displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.|$|E

50|$|In electrolytes, such as salt water, {{the charge}} {{carriers}} are ions, which are atoms or molecules that have gained or lost electrons <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> electrically charged. Atoms that have gained electrons <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> negatively charged are called anions, atoms {{that have lost}} electrons <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> positively charged are called cations. Cations and anions of the dissociated liquid also serve as charge carriers in melted ionic solids (see e.g. the Hall-Héroult process {{for an example of}} electrolysis of a melted ionic solid). Proton conductors are electrolytic conductors employing positive hydrogen ions as carriers.|$|R
5|$|There were {{initially}} no other major controversies for Dunstan, although the economy remained {{poor and the}} Redcliff complex was still in limbo as an agreement with Dow was still to be finalised. The financial difficulties forced a freeze on public sector expansion and hospital developments, and there were claims of theft and mismanagement in the health system, but the Liberals were in a disorganised state and unpopular, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not able to pressure Dunstan effectively.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} accused lived in Lancashire, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> sent to Lancaster Assizes for trial, where the judges {{were once again}} Altham and Bromley. The {{prosecutor}} was local magistrate Roger Nowell, who had been responsible for collecting the various statements and confessions from the accused. Nine-year-old Jennet Device was a key witness for the prosecution, something {{that would not have}} been permitted in many other 17th-century criminal trials. However, King James had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his Daemonologie. As well as identifying those who had attended the Malkin Tower meeting, Jennet also gave evidence against her mother, brother, and sister.|$|E
5|$|Chesma (Russian: Чесма, {{sometimes}} transliterated as Tchesma) was {{the second}} ship of the s built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s. When the ship was completed she proved to be very overweight which meant that much of her waterline armor belt was submerged. Russian companies could not produce the most advanced armour and machinery desired by the Naval General Staff, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> imported from the United Kingdom and Belgium. Chesma spent her career {{as part of the}} Black Sea Fleet.|$|E

5|$|Day {{focussed}} on the girls' education, in {{the style}} of Emile. He expanded on the teaching they had received from the Foundling Hospital in reading and basic arithmetic, and also taught them how to write. He believed that the girls should be able to manage the house, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> charged with cooking and cleaning as well as other housework. Finally, he {{wanted to be able to}} debate complex concepts with them, so he taught them rudimentary theories in physics and geography, tasking them with observing the changing of the seasons, and recording details of sunrises and sunsets. He also imparted to them Rousseau's philosophical contempt for luxury.|$|E
5|$|Dustin Kensrue and Teppei Teranishi {{knew each}} other from school and had played in a band called Chapter 11. Teppei {{recruited}} his skate park friend Eddie Breckenridge to play bass, who then brought his brother Riley on as a drummer. In 1998, before their first show, they realized they needed a name. Hard-pressed for time, they decided {{to go with the}} name 'Thrice' out of desperation. Thrice was initially an inside joke between the band members, {{and they were going to}} use it only temporarily for their first show. However, they began to gain fans with the name, and people started to associate them with it, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> forced to keep it.|$|E
5|$|Early {{members of}} the group often proselytized on street corners for hours, and Clarence13X's assistants led classes about the group's teachings, {{strictly}} enforcing study habits. He instructed his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters. Once they did <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> said to gain an understanding of profound truths. These lessons were taught in a form that resembled catechisms. Rather than hold services in mosques, they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments, which were often held outdoors. Attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that Ted Swedenburg of the University of Arkansas has compared to Quaker meetings.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to some strengthening, there were alterations {{to the air}} intake, which had throughout the P.1127 and Kestrel series featured an inflatable lip to smooth the intake airflow when the aircraft was almost stationary. There were concerns about the service life of these devices, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> replaced with conventional suction relief doors. Experience gained during naval testing on board the commando carrier HMS Bulwark in 1966 convinced project officers that less reactive materials would be substituted for all uses of magnesium in the Kestrel's airframe, in any further prototypes and production aircraft. The Kestrel became the prototype for pre-production Harriers.|$|E
5|$|Justice Potter Stewart, {{joined by}} Justice Hugo Black, dissented. Stewart {{acknowledged}} that the Wolf River Treaty unquestionably conferred hunting and fishing rights on the tribe and its members. He stated that the Termination Act subjected {{the members of the}} tribe to the same laws that all other citizens of Wisconsin were held to, including hunting and fishing regulations. In Stewart's opinion, Public Law 280 had no bearing on the case and the rights were not protected by the Termination Act, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> lost. Stewart did note that this would have also made the claim for compensation valid under Shoshone Tribe v. United States, regardless of whether Congress intended it or not. He would have reversed the decision of the Court of Claims.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{made of steel}} tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to duplicate {{the look of the}} real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.|$|E

5|$|Richard de Rulos, who was Lord of Deeping Fen {{during the}} reign of William the Conqueror erected a strong {{embankment}} to prevent flooding of the meadows adjoining the river, which then became fertile fields and a pleasure garden. During the reign of Henry III (1207–1272), complaints were made that of the two channels below Crowland, the one to Spalding was more favourable to the passage of barges, but the Abbot of Crowland had obstructed and narrowed its course by planting willow trees. In the fourteenth century, Spalding was charged with failing to scour and repair the river, causing damage to the king's liege people, but argued that because it was tidal at this point, it was an arm of the sea, and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not responsible.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{captured}} twenty-two LT vz. 34s - {{plus the}} prototype, when they occupied Czechoslovakia, {{but there is}} no record of their use <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> presumably quickly scrapped. Ten LT vz. 34s were captured after they were abandoned by the insurgents during the Slovak National Uprising in 1944. They were shipped to Škoda Works for repairs, but the local military representative ordered them scrapped because of their poor condition and obsolescence. The Waffen-SS tried to overturn this order as it planned to transfer them to Nazi puppet state of Croatia. Two were saved from the scrapyard, but by March 1945 the others had their turrets salvaged to be rearmed with two machine guns and mounted in fixed fortifications.|$|E
5|$|The Halifaxes and Horsas {{were moved}} to RAF Portreath in Cornwall, to shorten the {{distance}} {{they would have to}} travel. Even <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> left with a ten-hour flight to Sale airport in Morocco. On arrival at Sale the gliders were released to land on a sand-patch alongside the runway. Once on the ground each Horsa was fitted with the spare landing gear it carried inside, and the flight immediately took off again on the next leg of the journey, to Mascara in Algeria. Their journey did not end here; they left for the final destination, Kairouan Airfield in Tunisia, as soon as possible. During the flight the gliders were provided with three pilots, who had to change around every hour to relieve fatigue.|$|E

5|$|The Special Engineer Detachment (SED) was {{activated}} in October 1943 {{as part of}} the 9812th Technical Service Unit. It {{was made}} up of men with technical skills or advanced education, and was mostly drawn from the defunct Army Specialized Training Program. War Department policy forbade giving deferments from the draft to men under 22, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> assigned to the SED. It reached a peak strength of 1,823 men in August 1945. SED personnel worked in all areas of the Los Alamos Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombardment}} {{was scheduled}} to cease immediately before the assault companies deployed on Juno, but due to heavy seas, the landing was delayed by ten minutes, to 07:45 in Mike sector and 07:55 in Nan Sector. This was at a slightly higher tide, closer to the beach obstacles and mines. The LCTs carrying the field artillery were forced to adjust course to avoid landing too early; the LCTs carrying DD tanks were forced to break off their advance. The seas proved too rough to launch the DD tanks, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> ordered to deploy from the LCTs several hundred yards out from the beach.|$|E
5|$|The main {{design feature}} of the Mk. XIV was that it gave the bomb aimer more {{time to work on}} the problem of {{bringing}} the aircraft to the proper location to drop the bombs. As the calculations of this location were being carried out automatically, he could concentrate solely on the sight throughout the bomb run. The sight projected crosshairs into space <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in focused at infinity, allowing the user to focus their eyes on the target and not have to change focus to see the line.|$|E
