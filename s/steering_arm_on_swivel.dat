40|$|Abstract. Different process {{steps of}} the {{workpiece}} have different effects on the microstructure in the multi-stage forging. In this study, the effect of four different process steps of <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> <b>on</b> microstructure was studied by FEM. Results have showed that upsetting is beneficial to refine the microstructure as well as finish forging. Especially drawing can make the distribution of microstructure homogeneous while bending has less effect on it. The already-designed forging process for <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> was reasonable based on the simulation. Eventually, the grain size level of the <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> was tested as 6. 5 based on the conventional standard...|$|R
50|$|Boardman {{stayed in}} the {{championship}} for the 2013 season, driving the sole car entered by STR for the season opening Race of Italy. He clashed with James Nash on the penultimate lap of the Race of Italy, breaking the <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> <b>on</b> the SEAT and forcing Boardman to stop on the track. The race was completed with yellow flags in the second sector as Boardman's car was stranded on the racing line. Repairs meant he had to start from the pit lane for race two.|$|R
50|$|After pitting for {{tires on}} lap 47, Giacomelli rejoined in 12th place, {{just ahead of}} Jones, but about to be lapped by the Williams for the second time. As Jones moved inside to pass the Italian {{entering}} the hairpin {{at the end of}} the straight, Giacomelli turned in and Jones struck the Alfa Romeo's rear wheel, bending the <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> <b>on</b> the Williams and putting Jones out of the race. This left Piquet with a lead of more than a minute over Patrese and Arnoux, and he began to ease off, allowing some cars to unlap themselves.|$|R
50|$|The second race {{took place}} on Friday evening, with the {{starting}} grid based on the finishing order of the first race. Van Gisbergen and Whincup led the field away from {{the front row of}} the grid ahead of Mostert and Coulthard. Contact between David Reynolds, Tim Blanchard and Andre Heimgartner at the first corner saw Heimgartner spin. Blanchard made a pit stop {{at the end of the}} first lap to repair damage sustained in the collision. Pye locked a brake and went off at Turn 1 on lap 2, dropping to 17th place. James Moffat retired from the race after damaging a <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> <b>on</b> the same lap.|$|R
2500|$|The {{idea of a}} driverless tractor {{has been}} around since as early as 1940, when Frank W. Andrew invented his own. To guide his driverless tractor, a barrel or fixed wheel would be put {{in the center of the}} field and around it would wind a cable {{attached}} to a <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> <b>on</b> the front of the tractor. In the 1950s Ford developed a driverless tractor that they called [...] "The Sniffer" [...] but it was never produced because it could not be operated without running wire underground through the field. There were no major advances in driverless tractor technologies until 1994 when engineers at the Silsoh Research Institute developed the picture analysis system, which was used to guide a small driverless tractor designed for vegetable and root crops. This new tractor could even handle slight headland turns.|$|R
50|$|Race 10 {{took place}} on Saturday afternoon, with {{regulations}} requiring each car to make at least one pit stop to change all four tyres after lap 4. Slade maintained first place at the start while McLaughlin moved into second at the first corner. Contact between James Moffat, Garth Tander and Dale Wood damaged a <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> <b>on</b> Moffat's car, causing him to lose five laps while repairs were carried out. Tander suffered a puncture, forcing him to pit {{at the end of}} the first lap. Waters, Van Gisbergen and Lowndes were the first drivers to complete their pit stops, coming in at the end of lap 4. Slade stopped on lap 9, followed by McLaughlin on lap 10 and Winterbottom on lap 12. On lap 17, Waters and James Courtney made contact going into Turn 5, leading to a spin for Waters and both drivers going off the circuit. Both drivers lost a number of positions while they rejoined the circuit.|$|R

25|$|Di Grassi won {{the pole}} {{position}} for the first race by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and held off an challenge from Sarrazin to maintain the lead {{at the start of}} the event. He pulled away from the field and attention focused on his championship rival Sébastien Buemi, demoted from second to twelfth on the grid for changing his battery, after sustaining <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> damage <b>on</b> the first lap but was able to move up the field during the course of the race. The race was neutralised with a full course yellow flag when Loïc Duval and Nick Heidfeld collided on the 14th lap. Most drivers made pit stops to switch into a second car and di Grassi remained the leader following the end of the pit stops. Sarrazin ceded second to teammate Vergne who then started to draw closer to di Grassi but his chase was neutralised when López crashed on lap 24, necessitating the safety car's deployment. Di Grassi kept the lead at the restart five laps later and held off Vergne for the remainder of the race to secure his second victory of the season and the sixth of his career. No lead changes occurred as di Grassi was the only driver to lead laps in the first race.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} started behind the safety car with Muller on pole position. The race {{got off to}} a slow start with very few places {{changing}} hands. Nykjær returned to the pits on lap three with a driveshaft failure but he returned to the track after repairs. D'Aste spun on exit of Ascari on lap four and hit the barriers, skating over the track and then hitting the barriers on the other side before coming to a halt. Further up the field Basseng and Tarquini engaged in battle for 6th place before the safety car came out at the end of the lap 5 while the stricken BMW of D'Aste was removed. The race resumed on lap seven and Tarquini got past Nash to take fifth while Monteiro was also moving up the order. By lap eight Huff had made his way up the field to tenth place, displacing Tom Boardman from the final points position. Oriola ran wide at the second Lesmo with Tarquini moving up to fourth, Basseng then went through the gravel moments later. Boardman and Huff came across the line side-by-side at the start of lap nine but Huff failed to stop for the first corner and used the cut through for the second time during the race. Basseng was then issued with a drive-through penalty for not having all his wheels down on the grid at the three-minute warning. Barth touched O'Young on lap nine and the ROAL Motorsport car went off the track and through the gravel but returned to the track. Huff moved further up the order on lap ten, taking sixth place from Nash. Nash and Boardman then came together on lap eleven, breaking the <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> <b>on</b> the SEAT and forcing Boardman to stop on the track. The race was completed with yellow flags in the second sector, Muller took the first win of the season with Chilton second to take his first podium result in the WTCC. MacDowall also finished on the outright podium for the first time and took the independents' victory. The factory Hondas of Tarquini and Monteiro finished fourth and fifth.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} steerable, electrostatic, untethered, MEMS micro-robot, with {{dimensions}} of 60 µm by 250 µm by 10 µm. This micro-robot is 1 to 2 {{orders of magnitude}} smaller in size than previous micro-robotic systems. The device consists of a curved, cantilevered <b>steering</b> <b>arm,</b> mounted <b>on</b> an untethered scratch drive actuator. These two components are fabricated monolithically from the same sheet of conductive polysilicon, and receive a common power and control signal through a capacitive coupling with an underlying electrical grid. All locations on the grid receive the same power and control signal, so that the devices can be operated without knowledge of their position on the substrate and without constraining rails or tethers. Control and power delivery waveforms are broadcast to the device through the capacitive power coupling, and are decoded by the electromechanical response of the device body. Individual control of the component actuators provides two distinct motion gaits (forward motion and turning), which together allow full coverage of a planar workspace (the robot is globally controllable). These MEMS micro-robots demonstrate turning error of less than 3. 7 ◦ /mm during forward motion, turn with radii as small as 176 µm, and achieve speeds of over 200 µm/sec, with an average step size of 12 nm. They {{have been shown to}} operate open-loop for distances exceeding 35 cm without failure, and can be controlled through teleoperation to navigate complex paths. ...|$|R

50|$|Typically, {{one end of}} {{the drag}} link is {{connected}} via the Pitman <b>arm</b> and <b>steering</b> gearbox to the steering wheel (providing the connection between the driver and the steering system); the other end is attached to the steering linkage, by the <b>steering</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ultimately {{its most}} popular form was an {{hour-glass}} shaped worm which engages with a double-toothed roller follower on the rocker shaft for the <b>steering</b> <b>arm.</b> The {{result is that}} substantially the same leverage is provided from one steering lock to the other.|$|R
50|$|A {{parallelogram}} {{steering linkage}} is called such because like its name sake {{the two sides}} of the linkage run parallel to each other and are equal in distance. This type of steering linkage uses four tie rods, one inner and one outer on each side (left and right), a center link (which runs between the tie rods), an idler <b>arm</b> <b>on</b> the passenger side, and a pitman <b>arm</b> <b>on</b> the driver side. The pitman arm attaches to the steering gear output shaft which is also commonly called the pitman shaft. The pitman arm attaches to the center link and is moved by turning the steering wheel. The center link transfers the movement from the pitman arm and pitman shaft to the idler <b>arm</b> <b>on</b> the passenger side. The inner tie rods are mounted to the center link and transfer steering motion to the <b>steering</b> <b>arms</b> and outer tie rods. All of the joints which mount these components are constructed of small ball and socket joints to provide the necessary freedom of movement required to maintain control over the vehicle while it is in motion. The most common type of steering is the parallelogram. The cross-steer and Haltenberger linkage designs are used on some trucks and vans.|$|R
