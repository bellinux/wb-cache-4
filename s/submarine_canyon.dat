5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent. This {{is an area of}} the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid occurs, often {{in the form of a}} deep-sea brine pool. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey <b>Submarine</b> <b>Canyon</b> just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|The {{time scale}} and {{sequence}} {{over which the}} river's present course and the Grand Canyon were formed is uncertain. Before the Gulf of California was formed around 12 to 5million years ago by faulting processes along the boundary of the North American and Pacific plates, the Colorado flowed west to an outlet on the Pacific Ocean – possibly Monterey Bay on the Central California coast, forming the Monterey <b>submarine</b> <b>canyon.</b> The uplift of the Sierra Nevada mountains began about 4.5million years ago, diverting the Colorado southwards towards the Gulf. As the Colorado Plateau continued to rise between 5 and 2.5million years ago, the river maintained its ancestral course (as an antecedent stream) and began to cut the Grand Canyon. Antecedence played a major part in shaping other peculiar geographic features in the watershed, including the Dolores River's bisection of Paradox Valley in Colorado and the Green River's cut through the Uinta Mountains in Utah.|$|E
25|$|The Monterey Peninsula and {{northern}} Big Sur areas {{are influenced by}} a marine climate that is pronounced due to the upwelling of cool water from the Monterey <b>submarine</b> <b>canyon.</b> Rainfall is 40to 50centimeters per year, but summer fog drip is a primary source of moisture for Yadon’s Piperia and other plants that would otherwise {{not be able to}} persist with such low precipitation.|$|E
50|$|Steep-sided valleys in {{the seabed}} of the {{continental}} slope {{are referred to as}} <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons.</b> Unlike <b>canyons</b> on land, <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> are thought to be formed by turbidity currents and landslides.|$|R
30|$|Daly’s {{hypothesis}} for {{the origin}} of <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> by density (turbidity) currents was quite popular in the 1950 s and 1960 s (Daly 1936). F.P. Shepard, who devoted his professional life at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California {{to the study of}} <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons,</b> concluded that <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> were formed not by a single mechanism, but by a combination of processes, such as subaerial erosion, submarine erosion, and faulting, {{over a long period of}} time. The point is that Shepard did not even consider the possibility of hyperpycnal flows in explaining {{the origin of}} <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> (Shepard 1981). Brine-related dense shelf-water cascading currents (Roveri et al. 2013) should not be confused with hyperpycnal flows in eroding <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons.</b> Importantly, there are no empirical data to document the erosion of modern seafloor by genuine hyperpycnal flows.|$|R
40|$|On the Seisho coast, <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> have {{developed}} {{very close to}} the shoreline and the discharge of fluvial sediment of the Sakawa River into the <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> has been reported, resulting in the net loss of sand into the offshore zone. The beach topography under dynamically equilibrium conditions owing to the sediment supply from the river and the sand loss into the <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> during several thousand years was reproduced using the contour-line-change model considering the grain size composition. Long-term beach changes around the <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> were accurately predicted and the effect of beach nourishment using a mixture of fine and coarse materials was investigated...|$|R
25|$|Before the Tertiary, {{when the}} sea level was {{much lower than}} at present, the Swan River curved around {{to the north of}} Rottnest Island, and disgorged itself into the Indian Ocean {{slightly}} to the north and west of Rottnest. In doing so, it carved a gorge {{about the size of the}} Grand Canyon. Now known as Perth Canyon, this feature still exists as a <b>submarine</b> <b>canyon</b> near the edge of the continental shelf.|$|E
25|$|The {{region is}} {{influenced}} by a major ocean current system. Off the coast, the west wind drift current splits to create the Alaska and the California currents (the California current system). The direction and strength of the currents regulate the upwelling/downwelling regime along the coast, with a flow towards the equator in summer (California current) and reversal in winter (Alaska current). In addition to these two currents, a large <b>submarine</b> <b>canyon</b> acts as a primary conduit for the transfer of sediment from the continental slope to the deep-sea.|$|E
2500|$|The Palo Colorado-San Gregorio fault system {{transitions}} onshore at Doud Creek, about [...] {{south of}} Point Lobos, [...] exposing {{the western edge}} of the Salinian block. [...] Stream canyons frequently follow the north-westerly trending fault lines, rather than descending directly to the coast. The Salinian block is immediately south of the Monterey <b>Submarine</b> <b>Canyon,</b> one of the largest <b>submarine</b> <b>canyon</b> systems in the world, which is believed to have been an ancient outlet for the Colorado River.|$|E
30|$|<b>Submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> play a {{critical}} role in serving as conduits for the transfer of sediments from the land to the sea (Shepard 1981; Shepard and Dill 1966). <b>Submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> are also important to understanding conceptual models of hyperpycnites (Fig.  16) because plant remains are used as a criterion to recognize large submarine fans (see Section 6.7). Therefore, it is imperative to acknowledge some fundamental aspects of <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> that are well established.|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} of <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> {{is believed to}} occur {{as the result of}} at least two main process: 1) erosion by turbidity current erosion; and 2) slumping and mass wasting of the continental slope. While at first glance, the erosion patterns of <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> may appear to mimic those of river-canyons on land, due to the markedly different erosion processes that have been found to take place underwater at the soil/ water interface, several notably different erosion patterns have been observed in the {{formation of}} typical <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|About 3% of <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> include shelf valleys {{that have}} cut {{transversely}} across continental shelves, and which begin with their upstream ends {{in alignment with}} and sometimes within the mouths of large rivers, such as the Congo River and the Hudson Canyon. About 28.5% of <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> cut back into {{the edge of the}} continental shelf, whereas the majority (about 68.5%) of <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> have not managed at all to cut significantly across their continental shelves, having their upstream beginnings or [...] "heads" [...] on the continental slope, below the edge of continental shelves.|$|R

2500|$|The {{off-shore}} {{region of}} the Big Sur Coast is protected by the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Within that sanctuary are other conservation areas and parks. The onshore topography that drops abruptly into the Pacific continues offshore where a narrow continental shelf drops to the continental slope {{in only a few}} miles. The ocean reaches a depth of more than [...] just 50miles (80km) offshore. Two deep submarine canyons cut into the shelf near the Big Sur coast: the Sur <b>Submarine</b> <b>Canyon,</b> reaching a depth of 3000ft (914m) just 8miles [...] (13km) south of Point Sur, and Partington <b>Submarine</b> <b>Canyon,</b> which reaches a similar depth of 6.8miles (11km) offshore of Grimes Canyon.|$|E
2500|$|Europe's deep-ocean margin, {{from the}} Arctic to the Iberian Margin, {{and across the}} Mediterranean to the Black Sea, [...] spans a {{distance}} of over 15,000km and hosts a number of diverse habitats and ecosystems. Deep water coral reefs, undersea mountains populated by a multitude of organisms, vast <b>submarine</b> <b>canyon</b> systems, and hydrothermal vents {{are some of the}} features contained therein. The traditional view of the deep-sea realm as a hostile and barren place was discredited long ago, and scientists now know that much of Europe's deep sea is rich and diverse.|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} and origin of seafloor and subsurface undulations were {{studied in the}} Shenhu area, northern South China Sea using high-precision multibeam bathymetric map and high-resolution 2 D seismic data. Two undulation structure fields associated with <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> have been identified. One structure field is developed in canyon head areas and shows waveform morphology on the bathymetric map. The waves display wavelengths and wave heights of 1 - 2 km and 20 - 50 m, respectively, generally occur on slopes from 1 degrees to 5 degrees, and extend for about 15 km approximately parallel to the canyon's orientation. The other structure field is developed in the lower segment or mouth area of <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons.</b> In general, the waves display wavelengths and wave heights of 1. 3 - 3. 6 km and 50 - 80 m, respectively, occur on slopes of approximately 2 degrees, and extend for more than 20 km. Sediment cores from crests between <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> in the lower segment include predominantly silts and clayey silts. Since undulations in the two fields show differences in morphology and internal architectures, two different formation mechanisms are suggested. Seafloor undulations in the head area of <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> are interpreted as creep folds induced by soft sediment deformation. Undulation structures in the lower segment or the mouth area of <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> are sediment waves constructed by turbidity currents overflows along the <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons...</b>|$|R

40|$|By {{means of}} ROV surveys, we {{assessed}} the quantity, composition and bathymetric distribution of marine litter in 17 sites along the Sardinian continental margin (Central Western Mediterranean) at depths ranging from 100 to 480 m. None of the investigated sites was litter free, but the mean density of litter (0. 0175 Â± 0. 0022 itemsm- 2) {{was lower than}} that reported from other Tyrrhenian regions. The difference in the total litter density among sites was negligible, but the density of derelict fishing gear (DFG) items (most of which ascribable to small scale fishery) in <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> was higher in <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> than in other habitats. Our result suggest that <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> (known to be highly vulnerable ecosystems) act as major repositories of DFGs, and, therefore, we anticipate the need of specific measures aimed at minimizing the loss and abandonment of DFGs in <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Monterey Peninsula, {{discovery}} site of Potentilla hickmanii is in {{a native}} grassland opening within the Monterey pine forest. [...] The Monterey Peninsula {{is influenced by}} a marine climate that is pronounced due to the upwelling of cool water from the Monterey <b>submarine</b> <b>canyon.</b> Rainfall is 40 to 50 centimeters per year, but summer fog drip is a primary source of moisture for plants that would otherwise {{not be able to}} persist with such low precipitation. Some taxa, such as the coastal closed-cone pines and cypresses are relict stands, e.g. species that once extended more widely in the mesic climate of the late Pleistocene period, but then retreated to small pockets of cooler and wetter conditions along the coast ranges during the hotter, drier early Holocene period between 6000 and 2000 BC.|$|E
2500|$|Such is {{the nature}} of the geology of the New Zealand region that the true river tells only half the story of the Clutha's course. Beyond its mouth, a <b>submarine</b> <b>canyon</b> system extends for over [...] into the South Pacific Ocean, {{eventually}} becoming the Bounty Trough. The canyon system bears a remarkable resemblance to the pattern of river and tributaries visible on land, so much so that many of the rivers which empty into the sea along the Otago coast can virtually be considered tributaries of the Clutha's submarine system. These rivers include the Tokomairaro, Taieri, Waikouaiti, Shag, and even the Waitaki. The quartz and schist geology of much of the Clutha River catchment leads to the river transporting white quartz material downstream and depositing this on coastal beaches. The general northerly current in the Pacific Ocean leads to this sand being transported and eventually deposited on beaches north to the Otago Peninsula and beyond. The Roxburgh Hydro Scheme provides a barrier to the transportation of this material which has been linked to the erosion of beaches further north, notably St. Kilda Beach and St. Clair Beach, Dunedin, and along the Coastal Road at Kakanui.|$|E

30|$|Despite the {{critical}} role of <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> in forming <b>submarine</b> fans (Bouma et al. 1985), Zavala and Arcuri (2016) totally ignored {{the significance of the}} three types of <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> in their models for hyperpycnite fans. It is worth noting that the Type 1 and Type 3 <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> are likely to serve as conduits for extrabasinal and intrabasinal turbidites, respectively. For example, the Zaire Canyon (Fig.  17), which is a Type 1 canyon, would serve as a conduit for transport of plant remains from land to the sea, irrespective of the process, be it turbidity currents, tidal currents, or hyperpycnal lows. One could easily misinterpret the Type 1 canyon-fill deposits with plant remains as hyperpycnites, although tidal currents could have transported those plant remains. Shanmugam et al. (2009) interpreted canyon-fill deposits with plant remains as tidalites in the Bay of Bengal.|$|R
40|$|The {{continental}} shelf off South Australia is incised {{by some of}} the largest known <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons.</b> Extensive observations of <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> {{in other parts of the}} world have shown <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> can result in locally persistent upwelling regions. Along the southern coastline, westward slope currents including anticyclonic eddies and the Flinders Current (FC) can result in favourable conditions for upwelling in the vicinity of these canyons. Little data is available to describe the FC and so we review three global ocean circulation models and their representation of the FC. Though there are considerable differences between the outputs of these three models, this analysis provides a range of potential scales for the structure and transport of the FC. The reasons for the differences between the output of the three models are extensive, but to a first approximation, climatological surface wind stress products are compared. Dynamical descriptions of the flow past <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> are reviewed and in part extended, in particular the vertical scale of the induced motion is estimated as the Rossby height RH. A description of upwelling and downwelling flow incorporating vorticity stretching is also presented. An idealised model of the southern Australian {{continental shelf}} and the <b>submarine</b> <b>canyons</b> reveals the circulation is heavily modified by the presence of the canyons, inducing persistent upwelling of dense water onto the downstream shelf. In addition, one prominent feature of the induced circulation &# 150; a coastal jet &# 150; is found to be peculiar to flat inner shelf topographies. More realistic topography including a sloped inner shelf results in reduced shoreward transport within the canyon and hence reduced upwelling...|$|R
