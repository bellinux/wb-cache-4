40|$|Abstract In our dynamic world, {{decisions}} about noisy stimuli can require temporal accumulation {{of evidence to}} identify <b>steady</b> <b>signals,</b> differentiation to detect unpredictable changes in those signals, or both. Normative models can account for learning in these environments but {{have not yet been}} applied to faster decision processes. We present a novel, normative formulation of adaptive learning models that forms decisions by acting as a leaky accumulator with non-absorbing bounds. These dynamics, derived for both discrete and continuous cases, depend on the expected rate of change of the statistics of the evidence and balance signal identification and change detection. We found that, for two different tasks, human subjects learned these expectations, albeit imperfectly, then used them to make decisions in accordance with the normative model. The results represent a unified, empirically supported account of decision-making in unpredictable environments that provides new insights into the expectation-driven dynamics of the underlying neural signals.

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} fast Fourier transform (FFT), the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), the wavelet transform (WT) and other power quality detection algorithms, this paper puts forward to a new power quality detection algorithm which combines the Fourier transform with the wavelet transform. The transient {{as well as the}} <b>steady</b> state <b>signals</b> are separated on the basis that the wavelet transform is sensitive to the singular signals. The presented algorithm detects a variety of harmonic parameters of the gird after the separation of <b>steady</b> state <b>signals</b> is finished by fast Fourier transform. A new power quality detection system is then designed based on the core chip of S 3 C 2440 A, and the algorithm which is ARM- 9 based is transplanted into the embedded Linux operating system to carry out the experiments. Analysis of the experimental data shows the detection algorithm is reliable by Fourier transform and wavelet transform...|$|R

50|$|To {{resolve the}} two {{direction}} possibilities, a sense antenna is used, the sense aerial has no directional properties {{but has the}} same sensitivity as the loop aerial. By adding the <b>steady</b> <b>signal</b> from the sense aerial to the alternating signal from the loop signal as it rotates, there is now only one position as the loop rotates 360° at which there is zero current. This acts as a phase ref point, allowing the correct null point to be identified, thus removing the 180° ambiguity. A dipole antenna exhibits similar properties, and {{is the basis for}} the Yagi antenna, which is familiar as the common VHF or UHF television aerial. For much higher frequencies still, parabolic antennas can be used, which are highly directional, focusing received signals from a very narrow angle to a receiving element at the centre.|$|E

During one training condition, all the reinforcers {{in the presence}} of the rich-reinforcement signal were response dependent (i. e., a variable-interval schedule); during another condition only 25 % were response dependent (i. e., a variable-time schedule operated concurrently with a variable-interval schedule). An extinction session followed each training block. For both kinds of training schedule, and consistent with prior results, response rate was more resistant to extinction {{in the presence of}} the rich-reinforcement signal than {{in the presence of the}} lean-reinforcement signal. Analysis of interresponse-time distributions from baseline showed that differential resistance to extinction was not related to baseline differences in the rate of initiating response bouts or in the length of bouts. Also, bout-initiation rate (like response rate) was most resistant to extinction in the presence of the rich-reinforcement signal. These results support the proposal of behavioral momentum theory (e. g., Nevin & Grace, 2000) that resistance to extinction in the presence of a discriminative stimulus is determined more by the stimulus-reinforcer (Pavlovian) than by the stimulus-response-reinforcer (operant) contingency...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{contrary}} to numerous stories, before finding {{the articles in}} the Bell System Technical Journal it was discovered by many, some very unintentionally and to their annoyance, that a 2600 Hz tone, used by AT&T Corporation as a <b>steady</b> <b>signal</b> to mark currently unused long-distance telephone lines, or [...] "trunk lines", would reset those lines.

5000|$|In {{continuous}} flow analysis (CFA) a continuous stream of material is divided by air bubbles into discrete segments in which chemical reactions occur. The continuous stream of liquid samples and reagents are combined and transported in tubing and mixing coils. The tubing passes the samples from one apparatus {{to the other}} with each apparatus performing different functions, such as distillation, dialysis, extraction, ion exchange, heating, incubation, and subsequent recording of a signal. An essential principle {{of the system is}} the introduction of air bubbles. The air bubbles segment each sample into discrete packets and act as a barrier between packets to prevent cross contamination as they travel {{down the length of the}} tubing. The air bubbles also assist mixing by creating turbulent flow (bolus flow), and provide operators with a quick and easy check of the flow characteristics of the liquid. Samples and standards are treated in an exactly identical manner as they travel the length of the tubing, eliminating the necessity of a <b>steady</b> state <b>signal,</b> however, since the presence of bubbles create an almost square wave profile, bringing the system to steady state does not significantly decrease throughput ( [...] third generation CFA analyzers average 90 or more samples per hour) and is desirable in that <b>steady</b> state <b>signals</b> (chemical equilibrium) are more accurate and reproducible.|$|R

40|$|Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in the {{midbrain}} at 7 Tesla {{suffers from}} unexpectedly low temporal {{signal to noise}} ratio (TSNR) compared to other brain regions. Various methodologies were used in this study to quantitatively identify causes of the noise and signal differences in midbrain fMRI data. The influence of physiological noise sources was examined using RETROICOR, phase regression analysis, and power spectral analyses of contributions in the respiratory and cardiac frequency ranges. The impact of between-shot phase shifts in 3 -D multi-shot sequences was tested using a one-dimensional (1 -D) phase navigator approach. Additionally, the effects of shared noise influences between regions that were temporally, but not functionally, correlated with the midbrain (adjacent white matter and anterior cerebellum) were investigated via analyses with regressors of ‘no interest’. These attempts to reduce noise did not improve the overall TSNR in the midbrain. In addition, the <b>steady</b> state <b>signal</b> and noise were measured in the midbrain and the visual cortex for resting state data. We observed comparable <b>steady</b> state <b>signals</b> from both the midbrain and the cortex. However, the noise was 2 – 3 times higher in the midbrain relative to the cortex, confirming that the low TSNR in the midbrain was not due to low signal but rather a result of large signal variance. These temporal variations did not behave as known physiological or other noise sources, and were not mitigated by conventional strategies.

40|$|Abstract: In deep {{submicron}} (DSM) technology, {{the coupling}} capacitance {{is comparable to}} or exceeds the self or substrate capacitance, which in turn causes the delay of a transition in a wire to be twice or more {{than that of a}} wire transitioning next to a <b>steady</b> <b>signal.</b> In this paper, the authors propose a new coding technique which minimizes both coupling and self transition activities in the bus lines using the CODEC design of all classes of CACs based on binary mixed-radix numeral systems and spatial redundancy respectively. Using this framework, we then propose novel CODEC designs for three important classes of CACs; one lambda codes (OLCs), FPCs, and forbidden overlapping codes (FOCs). Our CODEC designs have area complexity and delay that increase quadratically with the size of the bus, while achieving optimal or nearly optimal code rates.

30|$|We {{developed}} ARAS, {{an automated}} radioactivity aliquoting system for dispensing solutions containing positron-emitting radioisotopes with particular focus on fluorine- 18 (18 F). The {{key to the}} operation of this system was a solid-state detector integrated in line with a peristaltic pump and computerized control of the motion of liquids in the calibrated system. The system demonstrated volume accuracy within 5  % for volumes of 20  μL or greater. When considering volumes of 20  μL or greater, delivered radioactivity was in good agreement with the requested radioactivity as measured independently with the dose calibrator. The detector operates in a DC current mode, where the radiation-induced photo-current is simply averaged over time to produce a <b>steady</b> <b>signal</b> proportional to the average rate of energy deposited in the Si diode. Thus, the response is insensitive to changes in normal lab temperatures where extreme changes in temperature are not expected. Moreover, the dual-diode scheme provides a measure of self-correction, since both front and rear diode channels {{are subject to the}} same changes in temperature.|$|E
