To improve the element quality at bifurca-tions, we extend the bifurcation handling as follows. 1. Instead of computing the line segment R 0 R 1 crossing the saddle point, we first find a surface patch R 0 R 1 R 2 R 3 that covers the bifurcation (i. e., the purple patch in Figure 1 (a)). To achieve that, the user specifies the four points, R 0, R 1, R 2, R 3, at the boundary of level set Li. Then, the shortest surface curves connecting R 0, R 3 and R 1, R 2 are computed, respectively. This step can also be automatically achieved by the following steps: 1) computing the line segment R′ 0 R 1 crossing the <b>saddl...</b>|$|E

40|$|Pressure {{measurement}} devices in equine sports have primarily focused on tack (saddle pads and saddle fitting methods). However, saddle pressure devices {{may also be}} useful in evaluating the interaction and distribution of normal forces between the horse and rider, including rider position and riding technique. This study examined the validity, reliability, repeatability and possibilities of using a saddle pressure device to evaluate rider position. All measurements were performed using a standing horse. Validity was tested by calculating the correlation coefficient between measured normal force {{and the weight of}} the rider. Repeatability was tested by calculating intra-class correlation coefficients. The use of normal force measurements to evaluate horse¿rider interaction was tested by adding a known weight to saddle or rider and collecting measurements with the rider sitting in four different positions. The device was found to be valid and reliable for force measurements when the measurement device was not replaced. The system could be used to determine the expected differences with added weight and in different rider positions. The normal force distribution measurement device proved to be a valid and reliable tool for studying the interaction between a rider and a static horse provided it is positioned carefully and consistently relative to both the horse and the <b>saddl...</b>|$|E

The well-known gradient criterion, �EŽ. x � 0, which defines the stationary {{points of the}} potential energy surface Ž PES., is reduced by one equation corresponding to one search direction. In this manner, abstract curves can be defined connecting stationary points of the PES. Starting at a given minimum, one follows a well-selected coordinate to reach the saddle of interest. Usually, but not necessarily, this coordinate will {{be related to the}} reaction progress. The method, called reduced gradient following Ž RGF., locally has an explicit analytical definition. We present a predictor�corrector method for tracing such curves. RGF uses the gradient and the Hessian matrix or updates of the latter at every curve point. For the purpose of testing a whole surface, the six-dimensional PES of formaldehyde, H 2 CO, was explored by RGF using the restricted Hartree�Fock Ž RHF. method and the STO- 3 G basis set. Forty-nine minima and saddle points of different indices were found. At least seven stationary points representing bonded structures were detected in addition to those located using another search algorithm on the same level of theory. Further examples are the localization of the saddle for the HCN � CNH isomerization Ž used for steplength tests. and for the ring closure of azidoazomethine to 1 H-tetrazole. The results show that following the reduced gradient may represent a serious alternative to other methods used to locate <b>saddl...</b>|$|E
