5|$|On June 17, Thome {{became the}} fourth major league player to hit 100 home runs with three {{different}} teams, joining Reggie Jackson, Darrell Evans and Rodriguez. Six days later, Thome hit a pinch-hit walk-off {{home run in the}} ninth inning off of Jake McGee to beat the Tampa Bay Rays, 7–6. This was Thome's 609th home run, tying <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa</b> for seventh all-time in home runs while also setting the new record for most walk-off home runs (13) in the modern era. Thome's last game as a Phillie was an afternoon loss to the Miami Marlins on June 30. After the game (which coincided with Howard's return from the disabled list), the team announced that Thome had been traded to Baltimore to serve as their designated hitter.|$|E

It features the 1999 rosters, and 1998 stats which included <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa's</b> 66 HR and Mark McGwire's 70 home runs.|$|R
5|$|On September 8 Braun, the Brewers' career {{home run}} leader, hit his 300th career home run. With {{the home run}} he became the 6th {{baseball}} player {{to have at least}} 300 home runs and 180 stolen bases in his first 11 big league seasons, joining Willie Mays (368 HRs, 240 SB), Reggie Jackson (313 HRs, 188 SB), Barry Bonds (334 HRs, 380 SB), <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa</b> (336 HRs, 224 SB), and Alex Rodriguez (381 HRs, 205 SB). After the 2017 season, Braun was also ranked first on the Brewers' all-time list in slugging percentage (.540), second in RBIs (989), and third in runs scored (937), doubles (345), triples (45), and stolen bases (193). Through 2017, he was sixth among all active ballplayers in career slugging percentage.|$|E

5|$|After {{getting one}} {{out in the}} top of the 7th, Steve Trachsel allowed a single and a walk to pinch hitters Brent Mayne and Armando Ríos respectively. The Cubs double switched, {{bringing}} in Matt Karchner to relieve Trachsel and Orlando Merced to play left field. Karchner induced another out before loading the bases on a single by Shawon Dunston. Félix Heredia entered in relief of Karchner and got Barry Bonds to ground out to first base to end the inning. The Cubs further extended their lead in the bottom of the 8th inning. After Alvin Morman got Morandini to strike out to open the inning the Giants double switched to bring in José Mesa to pitch and Bill Mueller at third base. Mesa allowed a single to <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa</b> and a double to Mark Grace which advanced Sosa to third. Following a ground out Mesa threw a wild pitch while facing Gaetti and Sosa scored to make the game 5–0.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was called}} up to the major leagues late in the 1998 season, and made his debut as a starter on August 1 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, earning a no-decision in his first start. [...] Over {{the course of the}} season, Roque had a 4-2 record with a 4.88 earned run average. Coincidentally, during his first Major League season, Roque gave up both Mark McGwire and <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa's</b> 64th home runs.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, after <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa's</b> public {{assertion}} that if baseball initiated testing for performance-enhancing drugs, he [...] "wanted {{to be first}} in line", Reilly suggested that he submit to preemptive, voluntary testing. [...] "Why {{wait to see what}} the players' association will do?" [...] Reilly asked. [...] "Why not step up right now and be tested? Show everybody you're clean." [...] Sosa refused, angrily. Reilly described the incident in his column the following week.|$|R

Twelve years later, after McGwire apologized for using steroids … Lupica wrote an article where he bashes McGwire for coming forward. Great lesson to teach your son Mike.” ...|$|R
5|$|In {{baseball}} statistics tie-breakers {{count as}} regular season games, with all events in them added to regular season statistics. For example, the Chicago Sun-Times noted that <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa</b> could {{have added to}} his notable home run total in the game. Sosa did add to his league-leading strikeout total with one in the 4th inning. Beck also added to his league-leading total in games played and earned his 51st save of the season which finished 2nd to Trevor Hoffman's 53 but is tied for the 9th highest single-season save total in MLB history. Several Cubs and Giants won awards for their regular season performances including Rookie of the Year honors for Kerry Wood, a Silver Slugger Award for Sosa, and a Rawlings Gold Glove Award for J. T. Snow. Sosa also won the Most Valuable Player award, earning 30 out of 32 first place votes (with McGwire taking the remaining 2).|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of two more expansion teams after the 1993 season had facilitated another {{restructuring of the}} major leagues, this time into three divisions each. Offensive production—the number of home runs in particular—had surged that year, {{and again in the}} abbreviated 1994 season. After play resumed in 1995, this trend continued and non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set. The next year, Mark McGwire and <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa</b> both surpassed Maris's decades-old single-season home run record, and two more expansion franchises were added. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of Major League Baseball (MLB).|$|E
5|$|The game {{remained}} scoreless in {{the early}} innings, with only two baserunners apiece for each team through the first three innings. The Giants loaded the bases with two outs {{in the top of}} the 4th inning, but Brian Johnson struck out to end the inning. The first runs of the game came in the bottom of the 5th as Henry Rodriguez singled to lead off the inning and scored on a home run by Gary Gaetti to give the Cubs a 2–0 lead. The Cubs threatened again in the next inning with singles by Lance Johnson and <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa.</b> Rich Rodriguez relieved Gardner, but loaded the bases with a walk to Mark Grace and allowed a single to Matt Mieske which scored two more runs and extended the Cubs' lead to 4–0. John Johnstone relieved Rodriguez and closed the inning without further scoring.|$|E

He stops gambling; his relationship with Wilkes grows; he gets new uniforms for the players (sponsored by one of his bookies); and he assumes a fatherly role in leading the team to the championship game (called, [...] "going to the ship" [...] by the boys).|$|R
25|$|Gene Silverberg {{said he and}} {{his brother}} began feuding with Jordan in 1996, when Jordan {{reportedly}} attempted to change the restaurant from a family-oriented business to a more upscale establishment. In 1997, Jordan opened his own Chicago restaurant, the more formal One Sixtyblue, and generally stopped appearing at the other except for charity events. Jordan's namesake restaurant continued to draw crowds despite his absence, but after Jordan's second retirement in January 1999, the Silverbergs announced that they would remodel the site as <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa's</b> Restaurant, a family attraction named after the Chicago Cubs baseball player. They planned to reopen Michael Jordan's Restaurant in a smaller building.|$|R
2500|$|In October 1999, Jordan asked {{a federal}} judge to {{terminate}} his contract with the Silverbergs, explaining {{that he had not}} received adequate information about the proposed move. Jordan was also angry that the Silverbergs told the press he was not appearing at their restaurant on a regular basis. He argued that he was never obligated to do so, and that the Silverbergs tarnished his image. The Silverbergs closed the restaurant for good in December 1999, and in June 2000 Jordan won exclusive rights to use his name for restaurants in Chicago. <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa's</b> Restaurant never materialized, in part because Sosa did not want to [...] "step on Michael's toes".|$|R
5|$|Ruth set the Major League Baseball single-season {{home run}} record four times, first at 29 (1919), then 54 (1920), 59 (1921), and finally 60 (1927). Ruth's 1920 and 1921 seasons are {{tied for the}} widest margin of victory for a home run {{champion}} as he topped the next highest total by 35 home runs in each season. The single season mark of 60 stood for 34 years until Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961. Maris' mark was broken 37 years later by both Mark McGwire and <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa</b> during the 1998 home run record chase, with McGwire ultimately setting the mark at 70. Barry Bonds, who also has the most career home runs, set the current single season record of 73 in 2001. The 1998 and 2001 seasons each had 4 players hit 50 or more home runs – Greg Vaughn, Ken Griffey, Jr., Sosa, and McGwire in 1998 and Alex Rodriguez, Luis Gonzalez, Sosa, and Bonds in 2001. A player has hit 50 or more home runs 42 times, 25 times since 1990. The lowest home run total to lead a major league was four, recorded in the NL by Lip Pike in 1877 and Paul Hines in 1878.|$|E

He homered once every 13.1 at bats, the third-best ratio in the league behind Bonds' 8.8 and <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa's</b> 11.3.|$|R
50|$|McFarlane {{continues}} to be an avid baseball fan. In 1998, he paid $2.6 million USD at auction for the baseball that St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Mark McGwire hit for his then record-breaking 70th home run, and $175,000 for <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa's</b> 66th home run ball. In June 2003 McFarlane paid about $517,500 at auction for San Francisco Giants left fielder Barry Bonds' October 2001, record-breaking 73rd home run ball. The auction took place at the ESPN Zone in New York's Times Square and was featured live on SportsCenter. When asked by Time magazine's Michael Grunwald in a 2007 interview if he was interested in Bonds' record 756th career home run ball, McFarlane indicated that he was more interested in Bonds' last home run ball.|$|R
500|$|The {{topic of}} the use of {{androstenedione}} drew substantially increased attention in 1998 during McGwire's and <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa's</b> chase of Roger Maris' home run record of 61. [...] McGwire had openly admitted to using just weeks after Bagwell had done so. [...] At the time, androstenedione was a substance of widespread consumption around the major leagues, as the FDA did not prohibit its use; MLB likewise had not found reason to do so. [...] However, it was then already classified as an anabolic steroid and thus banned by the International Olympic Committee, the NFL and the NCAA. [...] In 2004, MLB announced they had listed androstenedione as a banned substance in accordance with their drug policy. [...] In April 2004, the FDA sent letters to 23 pharmaceutical drug companies ordering them to stop distributing products sold as dietary supplements that contain androstenedione.|$|R
25|$|As the 1998 season progressed, {{it became}} clear that McGwire, Seattle Mariners outfielder Ken Griffey Jr., and Chicago Cubs outfielder <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa</b> were all on track to break Roger Maris' single-season home run record. The race to break the record first {{attracted}} media attention as the home run leader changed often throughout the season. On August 19, Sosa hit his 48th home run to move ahead of McGwire. However, later that day McGwire hit his 48th and 49th home runs to regain the lead.|$|E
25|$|He {{appeared}} in the 1994 movie Cobb as an unidentified pitcher for the Philadelphia A's. In 2003, {{he was part of}} an advertising campaign for Armour hot dogs with MLB players Ken Griffey Jr., Derek Jeter, and <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa.</b> Since 2005, Clemens has also {{appeared in}} many commercials for Texas-based supermarket chain H-E-B. In 2007, he appeared on a baseball-themed episode of MythBusters ("Baseball Myths"). He has also starred in a recent commercial for Cingular parodying his return from retirement. He was calling his wife, Debra Godfrey, and a dropped call resulted in his return to the Yankees.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, St. Louis Cardinals {{first baseman}} Mark McGwire and Chicago Cubs outfielder <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa</b> {{engaged in a}} home run race for the ages. With both rapidly {{approaching}} Roger Maris's record of 61 home runs (set in 1961), seemingly the entire nation watched as the two power hitters raced {{to be the first}} to break the record. McGwire reached 62 first on September 8, 1998, with Sosa also eclipsing it later. Sosa finished with 66 home runs, just behind McGwire's unheard-of 70. However, recent steroid allegations have marred the season in the minds of many fans.|$|E
50|$|Trout {{became the}} {{youngest}} player ever to hit at least 20 home runs and steal at least 40 bases in a season. Houston Astros center fielder César Cedeño had been the youngest player to accomplish the feat, doing so in 1972. He also {{became the youngest}} hitter ever to hit at least 20 home runs and steal at least 30 bases in a season. Trout scored his 100th run of the season on August 26, becoming the second Angels rookie to score at least 100 runs in a season after Devon White. Trout set a new Angels record for runs scored in a rookie season, passing White. Trout scored three runs that day, the tenth time in the 2012 season where he scored three or more runs in one game, the most since <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa's</b> 11 games in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|On September 13, 1998, {{he grabbed}} <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa's</b> 61st home run at Wrigley Field in Chicago. [...] Witt was {{actually}} {{not in the}} ballpark that day but was outside of left field standing {{on the corner of}} Waveland Avenue and Kenmore St. The ball came out just missing the apartment building across the street, bounced off a man's shin and then rolled right into the glove of Witt. [...] Several regulars surrounded Witt and hustled him into a van for safety. Witt spent the next 30 minutes doing interviews, signing autographs and even had a visit from Jeff Idleson of the Baseball Hall of Fame to authenticate that ball. Initially turning down a reported five-figure sum, Witt later sold the ball for $7,500 to a collector in Chicago, who promptly returned the ball to Sosa one week later.|$|R
50|$|The Cubs {{won their}} first NL Central crown in 2003. The team's {{success can be}} {{attributed}} mostly to its dominant starting rotation, which featured Mark Prior, Kerry Wood, Carlos Zambrano, and Matt Clement, all of whom won at least 13 games. The pitching staff as a whole led the National League in Strikeouts with 1,404. At mid-season, the Cubs had overcome <b>Sammy</b> <b>Sosa's</b> corked bat incident, and found themselves {{in the thick of}} the pennant race, and were looking for a replacement for Bill Mueller, who was traded near the end of the '02 campaign. Initially, there was talk of a deal for Marlin's 3B Mike Lowell, which came very close to fruition. Eventually, the team hit paydirt after trading Mark Bellhorn for Jose Hernandez and then trading Hernandez and Bobby Hill to the Pirates for Aramis Ramírez and center fielder Kenny Lofton in what has proven to be a lopsided deal in the Cubbies favor.|$|R
