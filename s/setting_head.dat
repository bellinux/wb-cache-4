40|$|Head Tracking {{and pose}} {{estimation}} are usually considered as two sequential and separate problems: pose is estimated {{on the head}} patch provided by a tracking module. However, precision in head pose estimation is dependent on tracking accuracy which itself could benefit from the head orientation knowledge. Therefore, this work considers head tracking and pose estimation as two coupled problems in a probabilistic <b>setting.</b> <b>Head</b> pose models are learned and incorporated into a mixed-state particle filter framework for joint head tracking and pose estimation. Experimental results on real sequences show {{the effectiveness of the}} method in estimating more stable and accurate pose values. 1...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study is to evaluate levels of psychosocial distress in thyroid cancer patients. An analysis of factors contributing to levels of distress is included. Study Design. Individual retrospective cohort study. <b>Setting.</b> <b>Head</b> and neck cancer clinic at the Huntsman Cancer Institute. Subjects and Methods. A total of 118 newly diagnosed thyroid cancer patients were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate analyses evaluated levels of and factors contri-buting to distress. Results. Almost half (43. 3 %) of patients had significant dis-tress. Those with self-reported psychiatric history, use of antidepressant medication, and history of radiation treat-ment had higher levels of distress. On multivariate analysis, patient endorsement of emotional issues predicted a higher distress level. Conclusions. Thyroid cancer patients have high distress levels. Identification of thyroid cancer patients with high distress levels is important to offer additional support during cancer therapy...|$|E

50|$|Eventually, about 65 {{million years}} ago, Set began {{to feed on}} the {{energies}} of the dinosaurs, possibly due to their reptilian nature. This gave it the power to manifest on Earth again. However, when Gaea decided to let dinosaurs die out and be replaced by mammals, Set {{took control of the}} dinosaurs and made them attack the mammals. Gaea responded by summoning Atum (who had been living in the Sun), and the deity reassumed his Demogorge form and battled Set. Demogorge ripped <b>Set's</b> <b>head</b> off, but the demon possessed the power to grow two replacements instantly. Still, Demogorge continued to rip off <b>Set's</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
