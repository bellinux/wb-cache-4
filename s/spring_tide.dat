5|$|The {{planners}} then examined {{whether a}} commando force was feasible {{to accomplish the}} task. An unusually high <b>spring</b> <b>tide</b> was due in March 1942 which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel. The approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through.|$|E
5|$|The {{stretch of}} canal from Sharpness to Purton runs {{very close to}} the river. At a high <b>spring</b> <b>tide</b> they were {{separated}} by little more than the width of the towpath. The canal also has no locks, and owing to its width, not even any stop locks. Any damage to the canal bank could thus render the entire canal unnavigable.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{by three}} tugs from Cardiff {{to remove the}} wreck were unsuccessful, but the next <b>spring</b> <b>tide</b> carried the {{midsection}} up the estuary onto Town Bar, opposite Padstow, where it was a hazard to shipping. A miner named Pope {{was called in to}} remove it: he used gelignite without success, though the explosion was reported to have broken many windows in the town. In 2010 a wreck, identified as almost certainly the Antoinette, surfaced on Town Bar. The Royal Navy Bomb Disposal Unit failed to demolish it and it was marked with a buoy; in March 2011 work started to demolish the remainder of it using saws.|$|E
50|$|The estuary has {{an area of}} 8 km2, is shallow—the mean at {{high water}} of {{ordinary}} <b>spring</b> <b>tides</b> (HWOST) is 1.4 m—and predominantly intertidal, as only about 15 percent of the area lies below low water of ordinary <b>spring</b> <b>tides</b> (LWOST).|$|R
40|$|The Great Barrier Reef is {{a mosaic}} of regions {{of high and low}} reef density. Current meter {{observations}} upstream from a region of high reef density revealed that the tidal and low-frequency currents were steered away from the region during <b>spring</b> <b>tides</b> but not during neap tides. A mathematical model suggests that this effect was due to both tidal friction and to the dissipation of energy by eddies behind reefs at <b>spring</b> <b>tides.</b> For a high reef density region, this results in a longer residence time at <b>spring</b> <b>tides</b> than at neap tides. Conversely, this effect also diminishes connectivity between regions of high and low reef density at <b>spring</b> <b>tides.</b> This process may affect the recruitment and dispersion of fish and other larvae in the Great Barrier Reef. It may also invalidate the use of satellite altimetry and tidal harmonic analysis for currents in the Great Barrier Reef...|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{the course}} of Agnes' existence, several {{countries}} were affected by torrential rains and typhoon-force winds. Hardest hit was South Korea where record-breaking rains triggered widespread flooding. More than 12,000structures were damaged or destroyed by the storm and 191,000acres (77,300hectares) of farmland was inundated. A total of 113people {{lost their lives in}} the country while damage reached $134million. Taiwan saw similarly destructive rains which left 32people dead of missing. A further 14lives were lost in mainland China where coastal flooding from the typhoon's slow movement coincided with the <b>spring</b> <b>tide,</b> resulting in the greatest storm surge since 1949 along the Yangtze estuary and Hangzhou Bay. Much of Japan saw rains from the storm, though no significant damage or loss of life took place in the country.|$|E
5|$|Webb {{demonstrated}} his aggressiveness when {{he attempted}} to sortie on the first <b>spring</b> <b>tide</b> (30 May) after taking command, but Atlantas forward engine broke down after he had passed the obstructions, and the ship ran aground. She was not damaged although it took over a day to pull her free. He planned to make another attempt on the next full tide, rejecting Mallory's idea that he wait until the nearly complete ironclad Savannah was finished before his next sortie. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont, commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, had ordered the monitors Weehawken and Nahant into Wassaw Sound. Commander John Rodgers in Weehawken had overall command of the two ships.|$|E
5|$|Northumberland, {{named after}} the {{ceremonial}} county, was ordered on 2 September 1861 from the Millwall Ironworks. She was laid down on 10 October 1861 at its shipyard in Millwall, London. She was altered while on the building slip after Sir Edward Reed succeeded Isaac Watts as Chief Constructor. Unlike her half-sisters, the ship spent five years on the stocks before {{she was ready to}} be launched, partially due to frequent changes in design, although Northumberland was much closer to completion. The additional weight caused her stick for an hour on the slipway before she slid halfway down with her stern only supported by air, threatening to buckle the ship. Efforts by hydraulic jacks and tugboats failed to get her into the water on the next <b>spring</b> <b>tide</b> failed, but the use of pontoons on 17 April 1866 proved successful. Her builders went into bankruptcy while the ship was being launched and the liquidators seized Northumberland as a company asset once she was in the water. Eight months passed before the Admiralty could take possession and begin fitting out the ship. She was commissioned in October 1868 and completed on 8 October for a cost a total of £444,256.|$|E

25|$|Although {{attempts}} by three tugs from Cardiff {{to remove the}} largest piece of the wreck were unsuccessful, the next <b>spring</b> <b>tide</b> carried it up the estuary onto Town Bar, opposite the port of Padstow, where it was a hazard to shipping.

25|$|In {{many cases}} facies changes and other lithological {{features}} in sequences of sedimentary rock have a cyclic nature. This cyclic nature {{was caused by}} cyclic changes in sediment supply and the sedimentary environment. Most of these cyclic changes are caused by astronomic cycles. Short astronomic cycles can {{be the difference between}} the tides or the <b>spring</b> <b>tide</b> every two weeks. On a larger time-scale, cyclic changes in climate and sea level are caused by Milankovitch cycles: cyclic changes in the orientation and/or position of the Earth's rotational axis and orbit around the Sun. There are a number of Milankovitch cycles known, lasting between 10,000 and 200,000 years.|$|E
25|$|On 7 March the Palace Hotel {{where the}} raid {{planning}} was being undertaken caught fire, {{it might have}} been sabotage, and to avoid calling the civilian fire brigade, who might see the attack plans inside the building, the Germans rigged it with explosives to create a fire break, however they exploded early, killing nine soldiers. Next day, on 8 March, to coincide with a <b>spring</b> <b>tide,</b> 13 ships sailed. One American patrol boat guarding the port of Granville, PC564 was alerted by a radar station that identified the convoy, but when it went to the attack, PC564 was destroyed by 88mm shells from German ferries armed with 8.8 cm SK C/35 naval guns. No alert had been sounded in Granville and the ships carrying German troops landed almost unopposed at the French port.|$|E

25|$|Flooding on the Trent {{can also}} be caused by the effects of storm surges {{independently}} of fluvial flows, a series of which occurred during October and November 1954, resulting in the worse tidal flooding experienced along the lower reaches. These floods revealed {{the need for a}} tidal protection scheme, which would cope with the flows experienced in 1947 and the tidal levels from 1954, and subsequently the floodbanks and defences along the lower river were improved to this standard with the works being completed in 1965. In December 2013, the largest storm surge since the 1950s occurred on the Trent, when a high <b>spring</b> <b>tide</b> combined with strong winds and a low pressure weather system, produced elevated tidal river levels in the lower reaches. The resulting surge overtopped the flood defences in the area near Keadby and Burringham, flooding 50 properties.|$|E
25|$|The graph of Cook Strait's tides shows {{separately}} {{the high}} water and low water height and time, through November 2007; {{these are not}} measured values but instead are calculated from tidal parameters derived from years-old measurements. Cook Strait's nautical chart offers tidal current information. For instance the January 1979 edition for 41°13·9’S 174°29·6’E (north west of Cape Terawhiti) refers timings to Westport while the January 2004 issue refers to Wellington. Near Cape Terawhiti {{in the middle of}} Cook Strait the tidal height variation is almost nil while the tidal current reaches its maximum, especially near the notorious Karori Rip. Aside from weather effects, the actual currents through Cook Strait are influenced by the tidal height differences between the two ends of the strait and as can be seen, only one of the two spring tides at the north end (Nelson) has a counterpart <b>spring</b> <b>tide</b> at the south end (Wellington), so the resulting behaviour follows neither reference harbour.|$|E
25|$|It is {{reasonable}} to assume that the present site of Cromer, around the parish church of Saints Peter and Paul, is what was in 1337 called Shipden-juxta-Felbrigg, {{and by the end of}} the 14th century known as Cromer. A reference to a place called Crowemere Shipden can be seen in a legal record, dated 1422, (1 Henry VI), the home of John Gees. The other Shipden is now about a quarter of a mile to the north east of the end of Cromer Pier, under the sea. Its site is marked by Church Rock, now no longer visible, even at a low <b>spring</b> <b>tide.</b> In 1888 a small pleasure steamer called Victoria struck the remains of the church tower, and the rock was subsequently blown up for safety. In the present day, members of Great Yarmouth sub-aqua club dived at the site, and salvaged artefacts from both the medieval church and the wreck of Victoria.|$|E
40|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{distributions of}} dissolved oxygen change dramatically during neap-spring tidal cycles {{in the lower}} Selangor and Klang Rivers. An oxygen deficit develops in both estuaries when the tidal range is high. The Selangor River inflow is nearly saturated with D. O., but during <b>spring</b> <b>tides</b> D. O. falls to as little as 15 % of saturation in the middle reaches of the estuary. The Klang River has low D. O. freshwater input, an oxygen minimum develops during neap tides, and anoxic conditions are produced by <b>spring</b> <b>tides.</b> These oxygen minima are attributed to the high oxygen demand of sediment that rests on the bottom during neap tides and is resuspended during <b>spring</b> <b>tides.</b> The ecological effects of tidal cycling patterns of dissolved oxygen in these Malaysian estuaries need further study, {{within the context of}} land use patterns and other human activities...|$|R
