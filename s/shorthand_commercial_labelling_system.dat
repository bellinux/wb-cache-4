40|$|Nanocrystals of the fluorogenic {{precursor}} fluorescein diacetate (FDA) {{were applied}} as labels {{in order to}} improve on the assay sensitivity achieved in our previous studies. Each FDA nanocrystal can be converted into similar to 2. 6 x 10 (6) fluorescein molecules, which is useful for improving immunoassay sensitivity and limits of detection. NeutrAvidin was simply adsorbed onto the surface of the FDA nanocrystals, which were coated with distearoylglycerophosphoethanolamine (DSPE) modified with amino(poly(ethylene glycol)) (PEG(2000) -Amine) as an interface for coupling biomolecules. This can be applied to detect different kinds of analytes that are captured by corresponding biotinylated biomolecules in different bioanalytical applications. The applicability of the NeutrAvidin-labeled nanocrystals was demonstrated in an immunoassay using the labeled avidin-biotin technique. Biotinylated antibody and FDA-labeled avidin were applied to the assay sequentially. The performance was compared with the traditional sandwich-type assay for mouse immunoglobulin G detection. Following the immunoreaction, the nanocrystals were released by hydrolysis and dissolution instigated by adding a large volume of organic solvent/sodium hydroxide mixture. The limit of detection was lower (by a factor of 2. 5 - 21) and the sensitivity was (3. 5 - 30 -fold) higher than immunoassays using <b>commercial</b> <b>labeling</b> <b>systems</b> (FITC and peroxidase). This study shows that using fluorescent nanocrystals in combination with the avidin-biotin technique can enhance assay sensitivity and provide a lower limit of detection without requiring long incubation times as in enzyme-based labels...|$|R

40|$|The food {{industry}} nowadays is becoming customer-oriented and needs faster response {{time to deal}} with food incidents. There is a deep need for good traceability systems to help the supply chain (SC) partners to minimize production and distribution of unsafe or poor quality products, which in turn will enhance the food SC performance. The current food <b>labeling</b> <b>systems</b> implemented in developing countries cannot guarantee that food is authentic, safe and of good quality. Therefore, the use of origin labels, mainly the geographical indications (GIs), allows SC partners to define quality standards and defend their products' reputation. According to our knowledge there are no studies discussed the use of GIs in developing countries. This research represents a research schema about the implementation of European quality <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> in developing countries and its impact on enhancing SC performance. An empirical study was conducted on the Egyptian traditional food sector based on a sample of seven restaurants implementing the Med-diet <b>labeling</b> <b>system.</b> First, in-depth interviews were carried out to analyze the Egyptian traditional food SC. Then, a framework was developed to link the European quality <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> and SC performance. Finally, a structured survey was conducted based on the applied framework to investigate the impact of Med-diet <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> on the SC performance. The research provides an applied framework linking Med-diet quality <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> to SC performance of traditional food sector in developing countries generally and especially in the Egyptian traditional food sector.

40|$|The {{scientific}} community agrees that emission levels from food {{production and consumption}} have to decrease {{in order for the}} world to reach climate targets. Environmental food labeling is becoming a policy tool to motivate consumers in their behavior of food purchase and consumption. This study examined sales data over 42 days from a major student cafeteria at the University of Oslo before and after the introduction of a traffic-light <b>labeling</b> <b>system.</b> In addition, the traffic-light <b>labeling</b> <b>system’s</b> effect on food purchase was compared to two other <b>labeling</b> <b>systems,</b> green-only and red-only <b>labeling</b> <b>systems.</b> The traffic-light <b>labeling</b> marked all dishes as red (highest environmental impact), yellow (medium environmental impact) or green (lowest environmental impact). The red-only <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> denoted only the highest environmental impact dish with red. In the green-only <b>label</b> <b>system</b> only the dish with the lowest environmental impact was labeled green. We analyzed two food products, meat and vegetarian dishes, investigating the percentage change in sales for the entire 42 days treatment period and for the 20 first and 22 last days separately. Independent t-test and ordinary least squares (OLS) method were used for analyzing the effectiveness of the food <b>labeling</b> <b>systems.</b> For the first 20 days of the experiment, traffic-light labeling led to a significant reduction in sales share of meat dishes (highest environmental impact dishes). Both statistical tests supported these results. Furthermore, the OLS method found a significant effect on sales share of meat dishes under traffic-light labeling for the whole 42 days treatment period. Traffic-light, red-only and green-only labeling did not {{have a significant effect on}} sales share of the vegetarian dishes (lowest environmental impact dishes). Looking at the results, one may claim that costumers need to compare the environmental information of one product to other products in order for an eco-label to influence purchase behavior. At the current level of evidence, eco-labels cannot be recommended as a single strategy for changing consumer behavior. Since the present study showed a small, but a significant, reduction of one <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> on the purchase of meat dishes, further research on the influence of eco-labels are needed before these labeling formats can be recommended as a public environmental intervention...|$|R

40|$|Recycling {{has become}} a more {{prevalent}} practice {{in the last few}} decades. However, the <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> on today’s packaging is not always clear in indicating whether something is recyclable. Recently, there has {{been a great deal of}} attention directed at a new system, known as the How 2 Recycle label, an innovative <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> expected to launch in the next few years. As the population continues to grow at unprecedented levels and more strain is placed on the global environment, recycling becomes more crucial. In the United States, the lack of a standard system for recycling on labeling and packaging deters people from properly recycling recyclable mat­erials. However, if a well-designed, standardized system were developed and employed, more people would practice recycling and thus, less recycled material would be thrown away into landfills. The purpose of this study was to examine the disadvantages of the current <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> on packaging and its efficiency in encouraging consumers to properly recycle. It also looks at the How 2 Recycle <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> and how it compares to the current system. A survey was conducted to gather data in order to establish how effective these two <b>labeling</b> <b>systems</b> are at communicating recyclability. The primary research objectives were to determine the efficiency of the current <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> on packaging and evaluate the potential of the How 2 Recycle label. Results from the survey data demonstrated the inefficiency and weaknesses of the current system. The data showed that the How 2 Recycle label scheme was preferred to today 2 ̆ 7 s system and had potential for success in the future...|$|R

The results disproved this assumption and demonstrated that sustainable building can be financially profitable. However, the research also showed that these positive financial aspects are hardly ever used to promote sustainable building. SenterNovem initiated a new research project in order to recommend practical solutions for the identified issues. Besides the sustainable and ‘regular’ building sectors, the new project included other sectors {{in an effort to}} develop new insights.
