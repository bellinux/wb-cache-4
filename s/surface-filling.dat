40|$|We {{analyze the}} new {{mid-infrared}} maps of NGC 6946 for {{variations in the}} color ratio of the 7 -to- 15 micron emission. Our preliminary findings are that this mid-infrared color is remarkably constant between arms and inter-arm regions, and {{as a function of}} radius in the disk, excluding the nuclear region. As surface brightness ranges by more than an order of magnitude and the radius runs from about 0. 5 to 3 kpc, the color ratio remains constant to about +/- 20 %. Our interpretation is that (1) hard UV radiation from OB stars does not dominate the heating of the grains radiating in the mid-infrared; and (2) that surface brightness variations are driven primarily by <b>surface-filling</b> fraction in the disk, and by radiation intensity increases in starburst environments, such as the nucleus of NGC 6946.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new class}} of operators for multiobjective evolutionary algorithms that are inspired on feedback-control techniques. The proposed operators, the archive-set reduction and the <b>surface-filling</b> crossover, have the purpose of enhancing the quality of the description of the Pareto-set in multiobjective optimization problems. They act on the Pareto-estimate sample set, performing operations that eliminate archive points in the most crowded regions, and generate new points in the less populated regions, leading to a dynamic equilibrium that tends to generate a uniform sampling of the efficient solution set. The internal parameters of those operators are coordinated by feedback-control inspired techniques, which ensure that the desired equilibrium is attained. Numerical experiments in some benchmark problems and in a real problem of optimization of a single screw extrusion system for polymer processing show that the proposed methodology is able to generate more detailed descriptions of Pareto-optimal fronts than the ones produced by usual algorithms.

40|$|Neural {{models of}} {{perception}} clarify how visual illusions arise from adaptive neural processes. Illusions also {{provide important insights}} into how adaptive neural processes work. This article focuses on two illusions that illustrate a fundamental property of global brain organization; namely, that advanced brains are organized into parallel cortical processing streams with computationally complementary properties. That is, in order to process certain combinations of properties, each cortical stream cannot process complementary properties. Interactions between these streams, across multiple processing stages, overcome their complementary deficiencies to compute effective representations of the world, and to thereby achieve the property of complementary consistency. The two illusions concern how illusory depth can vary with brightness, and how apparent motion of illusory contours can occur. Illusory depth from brightness arises from the complementary properties of boundary and surface processes, notably boundary completion and <b>surface-filling</b> in, within the parvocellular form processing cortical stream. This illusion depends upon how surface contour signals from the V 2 thin stripes to the V 2 interstripes ensure complementary consistency of a unified boundary/surface percept. Apparent motion of illusory contours arises from the complementary computations of form and motion processing across the parvocellular and magnocellular cortical processing streams. This illusion depends upon how illusory contours help to complete boundary representations for object recognition, how apparent motion signals can help to form continuous trajectories for target tracking and prediction, and how formotion interactions from V 2 -to-MT enable completed object representations to be continuously tracked even when they move behind intermittently occluding objects through time...|$|E
40|$|The Solid Surface Modeler (SSM) is an {{interactive}} graphics software application for solid-shaded and wireframe three- dimensional geometric modeling. It enables {{the user to}} construct models of real-world objects as simple as boxes or as complex as Space Station Freedom. The program has a versatile user interface that, in many cases, allows mouse input for intuitive operation or keyboard input when accuracy is critical. SSM {{can be used as}} a stand-alone model generation and display program and offers high-fidelity still image rendering. Models created in SSM can also be loaded into other software for animation or engineering simulation. (See the information below for the availability of SSM with the Object Orientation Manipulator program, OOM, a graphics software application for three-dimensional rendering and animation.) Models are constructed within SSM using functions of the Create Menu to create, combine, and manipulate basic geometric building blocks called primitives. Among the simpler primitives are boxes, spheres, ellipsoids, cylinders, and plates; among the more complex primitives are tubes, skinned-surface models and surfaces of revolution. SSM also provides several methods for duplicating models. Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) is one of the most powerful model manipulation tools provided by SSM. The CSG operations implemented in SSM are union, subtraction and intersection. SSM allows the user to transform primitives with respect to each axis, transform the camera (the user's viewpoint) about its origin, apply texture maps and bump maps to model surfaces, and define color properties; to select and combine <b>surface-fill</b> attributes, including wireframe, constant, and smooth; and to specify models' points of origin (the positions about which they rotate). SSM uses Euler angle transformations for calculating the results of translation and rotation operations. The user has complete control over the modeling environment from within the system. A variety of file formats are supported to facilitate modification of models and to provide for translation to other formats. This combination of features makes SSM valuable for research and development beyond its intended role in the creation of simulation and animation models. SSM makes an important distinction between models, objects, and surfaces. Models consist of one or more objects and are the highest level geometric entity upon which SSM operates. File operations are performed solely at the model level. (All primitives are models consisting of a single object.) The majority of SSM's manipulation functions operate at the object level. Objects consist of one or more surfaces and surfaces may consist of one or more polygons, which are the structural basis for the modeling method used by SSM. Surfaces are the lowest-level geometric entity upon which SSM operates. <b>Surface-fill</b> attributes, for example, may be assigned at the surface level. Surfaces cannot exist except as part of an object and objects cannot exist except as part of a model. SSM can simultaneously accommodate as many models as the host computer's memory permits. In its default display mode, SSM renders model surfaces using two shading methods: constant shading and smooth shading. Constant shading reveals each polygon of an object's surfaces, giving the object an angular appearance. Smooth shading causes an object's polygons to blend into one another, giving its surfaces a smooth, continuous appearance. When used in proper combination, each of these methods contribute to object realism. SSM applies each method automatically during the creation of primitives, but the user can manually override the default settings. Both fill attributes and shading characteristics can be defined for individual surfaces, objects, and models. SSM provides two optional display modes for reducing rendering time for complex models. In wireframe mode, SSM represents all model geometry data in unshaded line drawings, and no hidden-surface removal is performed. In simple mode, only the outermost boundaries (or bounding volume) that define each model are depicted. In either case the user is allowed to trade off visual authenticity for update speed. SSM is written in C-language for implementation on SGI IRIS 4 D series workstations running the IRIX operating system. A minimum of 8 Mb of RAM is recommended for this program. The standard distribution medium for SSM is a. 25 inch streaming magnetic IRIX tape cartridge in UNIX tar format. SSM is also offered as a bundle with a related program, OOM (Object Orientation Manipulator). Please see the abstract for SSM/OOM (COS- 10047) for information about the bundled package. Version 6. 0 of SSM was released in 1993...|$|R
40|$|We have {{modelled}} the X-ray {{emission of}} T Tauri stars assuming {{that they have}} isothermal, magnetically confined coronae. These coronae extend outwards until either {{the pressure of the}} hot coronal gas overcomes the magnetic field, or, if the corona interacts with a disc before this happens, by the action of the disc itself. This work is motivated by the results of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project that show an increase in the X-ray emission measure (EM) with increasing stellar mass. We find that this variation (and its large scatter) results naturally from the variation in the sizes of the stellar coronae. The reduction in the magnitude of the X-ray emission due to the presence of a disc stripping the outer parts of the stellar corona is most pronounced for the lower mass stars. The higher mass stars with their greater surface gravities have coronae that typically do not extend out as far as the inner edge of the disc and so are less affected by it. For these stars, accretion takes place along open field lines that connect to the disc. By extrapolating surface magnetograms of young main-sequence stars, we have examined the effect on the X-ray emission of a realistic degree of field complexity. We find that the complex fields (which are more compact) give densities of some (2. 5 - 0. 6) × 1010 cm- 3. This is consistent with density estimates of (1 - 8) × 1010 cm- 3 from modelling of individual flares. A simple dipole field in contrast gives densities typically an order of magnitude less. For the complex fields, we also find surface hotspots at a range of latitudes and longitudes with <b>surface-filling</b> factors of only a few per cent. We find that the dipolar fields give a relationship between X-ray EM and stellar mass that is somewhat steeper than observed, while the complex fields give a relation that is shallower than observed. This may suggest that T Tauri stars have coronal fields that are slightly more extended than their main-sequence counterparts, but not as extended as a purely dipolar field...|$|E
