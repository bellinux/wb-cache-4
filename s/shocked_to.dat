40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} short-run effects of <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> {{government}} spending on Ireland’s output and its real exchange rate. We {{show that the}} impact of government spending shocks critically depend {{on the nature of the}} fiscal innovation. Our main finding is that there are important differences between <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> public investment and <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> government consumption. Moreover, within the latter category, <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> the wage and non-wage components also have dissimilar effects. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{purpose of}} this paper is to identify the nature of impulse mechanism, from which random <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> general price and income levels are generated. In recent business cycle literature, it is generally accepted that business cycles are triggered by random productivity and technology shocks. However, this approach can not explain the current degree of volatility of business cycle fluctuations. Especially, New Keynesian economists emphasized the influence of demand shocks under the assumption of nominal and real rigidities and some other market imperfections. Therefore, it is convenient to identify whether the <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> the general prices and national income are on demand or supply side. It is shown in the paper that between the first quarter of 1987 and the fourth quarter of 2003 in Turkey, <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> national income are mostly composed of <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> demand factors. On the other hand, the <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> cost factors influence the <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> general price level more frequently than <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> demand factors. ...|$|R

Typos and grammar to be fixed, {{citations}} to {{be added}} At the quarterly frequency from 1968 through 2012, <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> expected average inflation over a bond’s life account for about 15 percent of <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> nominal Treasury yields. <b>Shocks</b> <b>to</b> real rates and term premia account for the remainder. Evidence from 1999 through 2012, when TIPS are available, suggest there is little difference between nominal and real term premia. Therefore nominal yield shocks are almost entirely real yield <b>shocks.</b> Efforts <b>to</b> link yield <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> economic activity <b>shocks</b> or inflation shocks largely fail...|$|R

In joint speci…cations, <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> volatility drive out <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> illiquidity leading to a drastic reduction in the statistical signi…cance of the illiquidity factor loadings. While innovations in illiquidity and innovations in volatility may still be jointly negatively priced, as is shown for our data, the factor loadings associated with volatility shocks provide a more accurate assessment of risk. When interpreting <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> illiquidity and <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> volatility as proxies for a more fundamental distress factor, this result is suggestive of the superior robustness of the latter...|$|R

40|$|The tug-o-war for {{supremacy}} between ination targeting {{and monetary}} tar-geting {{is a classic}} yet timely topic in monetary economics. In this paper, we revisit this question {{within the context of}} a pure-exchange overlapping genera-tions model of money where spatial separation and random relocation create an endogenous demand for money. We distinguish between <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> real output and <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> the real interest rate. Both <b>shocks</b> are assumed <b>to</b> follow AR(1) processes. Irrespective of the nature of shocks, the optimal ination target is always positive. Under monetary targeting, <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> endowment require neg-ative money growth rates, while under <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> real interest rates it may be either positive or negative depending on the elasticity of consumption substi-tution. Also, monetary targeting welfare-dominates ination targeting but the gap between the two vanishes as the shock process approaches a random walk. In sharp contrast, for <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> the real interest rate, we prove that monetary targeting and ination targeting are welfare-equivalent only in the limit whe...|$|R

In sharp contrast to the literature, we find substantial evidence of a link between monetary policy and exchange rates. Specifically, according to our results a contractionary <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> U. S. monetary policy leads to (1) persistent, significant appreciations in U.
