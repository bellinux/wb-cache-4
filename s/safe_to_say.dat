5|$|Maybe mid-year; <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, maybe like eight months or {{something}} like that. Best thing about it is we’re going to do it whenever we want to do it. There is no deadline right now, we don’t have any dates set, we don’t have the studio, we’re going to do the record ourselves. So we will literally go in and record it and it will be probably be done before we sign a contract.|$|E
5|$|The splendid artistic {{legacy of}} Angkor Wat and other Khmer monuments in the Angkor region led {{directly}} to France adopting Cambodia as a protectorate on 11 August 1863 and invading Siam {{to take control of}} the ruins. This quickly led to Cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner of the country that had been under Siamese (Thai) control since AD 1351 (Manich Jumsai 2001), or by some accounts, AD 1431. Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953 and has controlled Angkor Wat since that time. It is <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that from the colonial period onwards until the site's nomination as UNESCO World Heritage in 1992, this specific temple of Angkor Wat was instrumental in the formation of the modern and gradually globalised concept of built cultural heritage.|$|E
25|$|Data {{continue}} to be acquired and therefore any one analysis should {{be taken as a}} rough guideline only. Overall, it is probably <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the Linear Pottery culture spanned several hundred years of continental European prehistory in the late sixth and early fifth millennia BC, with local variations. Data from Belgium indicate a late survival of LBK there, as late as 4100 BC.|$|E
60|$|Paul felt it <b>safest</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{nothing at}} all, so he only looked at Miss Blimber's spectacles. Miss Blimber having shaken {{her head at}} him gravely, {{referred}} to a paper lying before her.|$|R
60|$|Fanny {{could have}} said a great deal, but it was <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> nothing, and leave {{untouched}} all Miss Crawford's resources--her accomplishments, her spirits, her importance, her friends, lest it should betray her into any observations seemingly unhandsome. Miss Crawford's kind opinion of herself deserved at least a grateful forbearance, {{and she began to}} talk of something else.|$|R

"Oh! no, I am {{sure you}} are a great deal too kind to--but if you would just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean that--As you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should not be hesitating--It {{is a very serious}} thing.--It will be <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'No,' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say 'No?'" ...|$|R
25|$|Unfortunately for Ismail, {{most of his}} {{subjects}} were Sunni. He thus had to enforce official Shiism violently, putting to death those who opposed him. Under this pressure, Safavid subjects either converted or pretended to convert, but it is <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that the majority of}} the population was probably genuinely Shia by the end of the Safavid period in the 18th century, and most Iranians today are Shia, although there is still a Sunni minority.|$|E
25|$|Although many {{speakers}} of Shilha are bilingual in Moroccan Arabic, {{there are as}} yet no indications that the survival of Shilha as a living language will be seriously threatened in the immediate future. Because of {{the rapid growth of}} the Moroccan population over the past decades (from 12 million in 1961 to over 33 million in 2014), it is <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Shilha is now spoken by more people than ever before in history.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{confusion}} among fans and media about the similar names of Infamous Mobb and Mobb Deep. Both groups are from Queensbridge; Mobb Deep released an album in 1995 titled The Infamous, and Infamous Mobb debuted on Mobb Deep's following album, Hell on Earth. Given the similar themes present in their artistic output, the social {{links between the}} groups, and their mutual collaboration on projects, it is <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the Infamous Mobb crew {{is an extension of}} the Mobb Deep duo.|$|E

60|$|A sad and mournful Sunday {{evening was}} {{that to the}} mother and daughter, as each sat over her Bible. Mrs. King would not talk to Ellen, for fear of {{awakening}} Alfred; not that low voices would have done so, but Ellen was already much upset by what she had heard and seen, and to talk it over would have brought on a fit of violent crying; so her mother thought it <b>safest</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> nothing. They would have read their Bible to one another, but each had her voice so choked with tears, {{that it would not}} do.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course,' Lady Exmoor {{answered}} faintly, with {{a devout}} hope that Lord Connemara wouldn't question her any further upon the subject; {{in which case}} {{she thought it would}} probably be the <b>safest</b> guess <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that she had seen it at the British Museum or in the Hamilton Library.|$|R
25|$|There is no {{reference}} to the Bhagavad Gita in Buddhist literature, the Tripitaka. The Buddha refers to 3 Vedas rather than 4 Vedas, as per general perception in many dialogues. So, there is doubt about whether the Bhagavad Gita was widely known about during the lifetime of Gautama Buddha.The Namboothiris of Kerala follows 3 Vedas only. According to Manusmriti (the law book of Manu) a Brahmanan who does not know the Vedic verses (at least of one Vedam) is useless. So it is <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Buddha only mentioned 3 Vedas just like the Brahman community of Kerala.|$|E
25|$|FitzGibbon {{opposed the}} Irish Catholic Relief Act of 1793 personally, but {{apparently}} recommended its acceptance in the House of Lords, being {{forced out of}} necessity when that Act had been recommended to the Irish Executive by the British Cabinet led by William Pitt the Younger. Pitt expected Ireland to follow the British Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 and allow Catholics to vote again and hold public offices. At the same time, FitzGibbon apparently denounced the policy this Act embodied, so it is probably <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that FitzGibbon's own beliefs and principles conflicted with his obligations {{as a member of}} the Irish executive of the time.|$|E
25|$|Most of Plato's {{philosophical}} {{ideas were}} communicated through his beloved teacher Socrates as {{a presence in}} the dialogues. Though there are no extant writings of Socrates known, it is evident through Plato's works that Socrates had an incredible ability to explore the most intense analytical discussions. However, for some there is controversy regarding how much historical fact can be derived from Plato's Socrates (Russell). Some doubt Socrates ever existed. Others are skeptical as to the accuracy of some of Plato's dialogues but nonetheless maintain that we can learn a substantial amount of historical information about Socrates from the dialogues. Still others take practically everything Plato wrote about Socrates as veridical history. Regardless, it may be <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Plato never meant to record Socrates verbatim and it may plausibly be concluded that his general ideas were communicated in the dialogues.|$|E
6000|$|It {{would not}} have been <b>safe</b> for us <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he was mistaken, but we knew he was. Nikolaus said, [...] "We ask pardon for the mistake, but we meant <b>to</b> <b>say</b> seven." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Gascoigne did hear--not Gwendolen's answers {{repeated}} verbatim, but a softened generalized {{account of}} them. The mother conveyed as vaguely as the keen rector's questions {{would let her}} the impression that Gwendolen was in some uncertainty about her own mind, but inclined on the whole to acceptance. The result was that the uncle felt himself called on to interfere; he did not conceive that he should do his duty in witholding direction from his niece in a momentous crisis of this kind. Mrs. Davilow ventured a hesitating opinion that {{perhaps it would be}} <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> nothing--Gwendolen was so sensitive (she did not like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> willful). But the rector's was a firm mind, grasping its first judgments tenaciously and acting on them promptly, whence counter-judgments were no more for him than shadows fleeting across the solid ground to which he adjusted himself.|$|R
50|$|It is {{probably}} <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that successive withdrawals of Roman troops from Cumbria throughout the 4th and early 5th centuries created a power vacuum which, by necessity, was filled by local warlords and their followers, often just based around a single village or valley. After {{the withdrawal of}} Stilicho in 401, the troops on the Wall were barely able to confront the raids of the barbarians to the north. These raids, as in the 360s, concentrated on the capturing of cattle and slaves, and they were seen off by the local communities themselves, so that by around 450, after the Third Pictish War, the Scots had withdrawn to Ireland and the Picts had left for Scotland north of the Forth.|$|R
25|$|On {{the eastern}} part of Dasmariñas, we can find Barangay Burol which is 3 {{kilometers}} away from the city center. The complete name of barrio Burol is Pansol-Burol. Pansol is a Tagalog word meaning aqueduct, while Burol, also a native word, means mound. Even though there are no historical records about its establishment, it is <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it was formed during the Spanish period due to the presence of ruins of old Spanish houses and sugarmills. The families of Quillao and Beltran are the first ones to settle in this place. This barangay became the hide-out of the Katipuneros/revolucionarios. During the Japanese occupation, there are some Dasmarineños who were killed in this place. They were Alfredo Purificacion, Pedro Calupad, Jose Yñota, Victor de Jesus and Angel Olaes. The Japanese soldiers also planted several cotton trees on the area. Now, this place {{is considered one of the}} richest barangay in Dasmariñas. Many schools and colleges can be found here such as the Southern Luzon College, International English Center, Asian Trinity School, and many others. Adjacent to the place is the Emilio Aguinaldo College. Numerous subdivisions and villages are also located here.|$|E
25|$|Lambert et al. (2005) {{examined}} {{the possibility of}} using DNA barcoding to assess the past diversity of the Earth's biota. The COI gene of a group of extinct ratite birds, the moa, were sequenced using 26 subfossil moa bones. As with Hebert's results, each species sequenced had a unique barcode and intraspecific COI sequence variance ranged from 0 to 1.24%. To determine new species, a standard sequence threshold of 2.7% COI sequence difference was set. This value is 10 times the average intraspecies difference of North American birds, which is inconsistent with Hebert's recommendation that the threshold value be based on the group under study. Using this value, the group detected six moa species. In addition, a further standard sequence threshold of 1.24% was also used. This value resulted in 10 moa species which corresponded with the previously known species with one exception. This exception suggested a possible complex of species which was previously unidentified. Given the slow rate of growth and reproduction of moa, it is probable that the interspecies variation is rather low. On the other hand, there is no set value of molecular difference at which populations can be assumed to have irrevocably started to undergo speciation. It is <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> however, that the 2.7% COI sequence difference initially used was far too high.|$|E
500|$|... "Take {{it all in}} all—the {{depth of}} the snowfall, the {{tremendous}} wind, the amount of damage done and the total unpreparedness of the people—I think it is <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the present storm is the worst experienced in Cleveland during the whole forty-three years the Weather Bureau {{has been established in}} the city." ...|$|E
60|$|About a post beyond Tubingen, a noble ruin of {{a castle}} {{of the middle}} ages {{appeared}} in the distance, crowning the summit of a high conical eminence. These were the finest remains we had seen in a long time, and viewed from the road, they were a beautiful object, for half an hour. This was the castle of Hohenzollern, erected about the year 980, and the cradle of the House of Brandenburg. This family, some pretend, was derived from the ancient Dukes of Alsace, which, if true would give it the same origin as those of Austria and Baden; but it is usual, and probably much <b>safer,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the Counts of Hohenzollern were its founders. We must all stop somewhere short of Adam.|$|R
60|$|To {{this day}} {{it gives me}} a thrill, or perhaps it would be <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the ghost of a {{vanished}} thrill, when I remember the relief it was in my case, albeit I was never so tied to a horse, so parasitical, as the gaucho, after one of these great thistle-levelling pampero winds. It was a rare pleasure to ride out and gallop my horse over wide brown stretches of level land, to hear his hard hoofs crushing the hollow desiccated stalks covering the earth in millions like the bones of a countless host of perished foes. It was a queer kind of joy, a mixed feeling with a dash of gratified revenge to give it a sharp savour.|$|R

500|$|On September 4, 2014, a 14-year-old girl in Port Richey, Florida, {{allegedly}} set her family's {{house on}} fire {{while her mother}} and nine-year-old brother were inside. Police reported that the teenager had been reading online stories about Slender Man as well as Atsushi Ōkubo's manga Soul Eater. Eddie Daniels of the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said the girl [...] "had visited the website that contains {{a lot of the}} Slender Man information and stories [...] It would be <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> there is a connection to that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's not {{for nothing}} that {{they call this}} show 'The Beyonce Experience.' Like the summer {{blockbuster}} movies crowding theater screens, this tour by the pop/R icon resembles {{not so much a}} concert as a series of thrillingly staged set pieces. It's <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that her fans will not be disappointed by the two-hour extravaganza. From the diva-style opening, when she rises from beneath the stage amidst a blinding sparkler display, to the final audience sing-along on the female-empowering hit 'Irreplaceable,' the star delivers a crowd-pleasing spectacle that offers as much visual as musical stimulation." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, Shakira {{performed}} the cover {{live at the}} Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, Somerset. Alex Needham from The Guardian called the performance [...] "a slinky cover" [...] that [...] "is {{a nod to the}} indie kids". Maria Schurr from PopMatters felt the performance was [...] "less intimate than the original", but [...] "managed to amplify the tremendous pop sensibilities embedded beneath Romy Madley Croft"s and Oliver Sim's hushed coos". She concluded by saying that [...] "as great as The xx are, it’s probably <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Shakira can cut a rug better".|$|E

500|$|In The Flash episode, Caitlin and Harry {{create a}} drug called Velocity 6 to make Barry faster against Zoom. Kreisberg commented that [...] "It's <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that there'll {{be a few}} more {{iterations}} of that formula" [...] but viewers {{will have to wait}} and see how everything plays out and the effects on those who use it. Teddy Sears who's character Jay Garrick uses the drug, which temporarily restores his speed said while his character is not fixated on restoring his speed, Velocity 6 presents an interesting fix that will tempt him due to his [...] "haunting memories" [...] of his previous life with powers.|$|E
500|$|The 1997 was {{the least}} {{successful}} season ever for the Highlanders. They finished last, and managed only three wins. They spent their pre-season playing in Scotland and England where they won all seven matches. Carl Hoeft said of the pre-season; [...] "Looking back now, it's <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it wasn't probably the best way we could have prepared. Even now, people think were crazy when I tell them what we did". They were now coached by Glenn Ross and captained by Taine Randell. Their eight defeats that season included a 7543 defeat by Natal in Durban. The points scored by Natal included 50 points by Gavin Lawlessa competition record. Their three victories that season included defeating the Canterbury Crusaders at Carisbrook, and the Waikato Chiefs at Taupowhere Doug Howlett scored three tries for the Highlanders.|$|E
500|$|Some commenters on Wright's Facebook page {{were skeptical}} of his claims, {{pointing}} {{to differences in}} the costume between the two videos; Wright explained the differences by saying he wanted, and made, a better cloak for the second video.

[...] "It {{would be too much}} of a hassle just to play along for this long, and making up stories that fit so well," [...] he wrote shortly after the second video was posted.

In an early December exchange on Facebook, Wright had told him he had chosen him as the recipient since he had [...] "won the business card lottery ... you handed me your business card, at some point".

60|$|I {{represented}} that {{it would}} perhaps be <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no more on the subject until Dolores had seen him, and to this he agreed. Madame Mendoza was very zealous in the affair, {{for the sake of}} getting clear of the presence of Dolores in the family, and her sisters laughed at her for her dejected appearance. They only wished, they said, that so much luck might happen to them. For myself, I endeavored to take as little notice as possible of the affair, though what I felt may be conjectured. I knew,--I was perfectly certain,--that Dolores loved me as I loved her. I knew that she had one of those simple and unworldly natures which wealth and splendor could not satisfy, and whose life would lie entirely in her affections. Sometimes I violently debated with myself whether honor required me to sacrifice her happiness as well as my own, and I felt the strongest temptation to ask her to be my wife and fly with me to the Northern states, where I did not doubt my ability to make for her a humble and happy home.|$|R

5000|$|The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission {{states that}} in the Slateford Water Gap area the first {{verified}} quarry started some time around 1808 [...] The industry in this region of Pennsylvania spread across the northern edges of both Lehigh and Northampton counties which contain between them the remains of approximately 400 individual quarries. The origins of quarrying in the Lehigh Valley are obscured by conflicting evidence, although it is <b>safest</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it started {{near the town of}} Slateford in the early Nineteenth Century and moved toward Bangor over a fifty-year period. By 1929, the value of slate production in Pennsylvania was approximately 5 million dollars, accounting for almost half of the 11 million dollar value of slate production for the entire United States. Quarries in this region of the country remained active throughout {{the first quarter of the}} 20th century producing roofing slate, slate for electrical uses, as well as being the largest producer of school slates and chalkboards in the country. The Slatington Slate Trade report for January 4 of 1880 showed that quarries in the town of Slatington alone had shipped 81,402 squares of roofing slates (over 8 million square feet) as well as 40,486 cases of school slates and 243 cases of blackboards.|$|R
