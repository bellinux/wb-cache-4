We study the border case when the radius of the spheres is of the third power order of the period and {{the ratio of the}} solid/fluid conductivities is converging to infinity when the peruod tends to zero. We apply a homogenization procedure by adapting the energy method introduced by Cioranescuand Murat and developed by Bellieud and Bouchitt√© on one hand, Allaire on the other hand. The macroscopic behavior is described by a nonlocal law of Brinkman-Boussinesq type and two heat equations, where the radiation and a certain capacity of the vanishing suspensions appear. This result completes those obtained for the thermal flow through an periodic solid matrix having a non-vanishing macroscopic porosity, <b>see</b> <b>Ene</b> and Polisvski...|$|E
