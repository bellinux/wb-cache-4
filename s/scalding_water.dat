25|$|An {{incident}} {{regarding the}} character of Sidney Dillon (or William S. Paley) is then discussed between Jonesy and Mrs. Coolbirth. Sidney Dillon {{is said to have}} told Ina Coolbirth this story because they have a history as former lovers. One evening while Cleo Dillon (Babe Paley) was out of the city, in Boston, Sidney Dillon attended an event by himself at which he was seated next to the wife of a prominent New York Governor. The two began to flirt and eventually went home together. While Ina suggests that Sidney Dillon loves his wife, it is his inexhaustible need for acceptance by haute New York society that motivates him to be unfaithful. Sidney Dillon and the woman sleep together, and afterwards Mr. Dillon discovers a very large blood stain on the sheets, which represents her mockery of him. Mr. Dillon then spends {{the rest of the night}} and early morning manually washing the sheet with <b>scalding</b> <b>water</b> in an attempt to conceal his unfaithfulness from his wife who is due to arrive home the same morning.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{determine the influence of}} dietary energy, environmental temperature, <b>scald</b> <b>water</b> temperature, and batch picking time on the carcass quality factors often associated with oily bird syndrome. In Experiment 1 birds were fed dietary energy levels of 3100, 3400, and 3700 kcal/kg and processed at either 53. 3 C scald and 60 sec picking time or a 60 C scald and 25 sec picking time. In Experiment 2 two dietary energy levels (3230 and 3440 kcal/kg) were fed to birds reared in either 23. 9 C or 35. 0 C environmental temperature pens. Three scalding temperature treatments (50. 0 C, 53. 3 C, and 56. 7 C) and two picking time treat-ments (30 or 60 sec) were evaluated on birds from each environmental and dietary treatment. Individual live weight, dry eviscerated weight, ready-to-cook weight, and moisture absorption after chilling were determined. Subjective scores for oily, loose, and broken skin were performed on each bird. Results indicated that dietary energy and environmental temperature had little effect, other than those influenced by bird weight, on the carcass quality parameters tested. <b>Scald</b> <b>water</b> temperature had little effect on moisture absorption but did influence the subjective skin scores. Increased scald temperature decreased loose and broken skin scores but increased oily skin scores.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a model of {{inactivation}} of Campylobacter jejuni in industrial scalding of chickens. Models can be used as a guide for broiler slaughterhouse operations for reducing levels of C. jejuni contamination on broiler carcasses. Mean concentrations of C. jeuni in terms of colony farming units (CFU) in <b>scald</b> tank <b>water</b> and in carcass rinse solution after scalding were 2. 90 ± 0. 07 and 3. 86 ± 0. 11 LogCFU/ml, respectively. <b>Scald</b> tank <b>water</b> temperature, flow rate, pH, and total solids in <b>scalding</b> process <b>water</b> were 54. 15 ± 0. 2 °C, 172. 0 ± 8. 4 L/min, 8. 0 ± 0. 01, and 2, 565 ± 114. 3 mg/L, respectively. Inactivation models were developed by using literature data for inactivating kinetics, of Campylobacter and the Arrhenius equation. Results of the inactivation models of scalding process indicated that high temperature and short time (less than 2 minutes) of scalding process were effective in reducing the number of viable cells. The model fits the experimental data well and the values of the estimated parameters provide insight for this process. The model can be used for process design and potential process modifications...|$|R

40|$|Suspended {{bacteria}} were enumerated in <b>scald</b> <b>water</b> and carcass rinse {{samples from}} a commercial broiler chicken processing plant with a multiple-tank, counterflow scalder. Coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter were enumerated and the Most Probable Number (MPN) of salmonellae was determined in water samples {{from each of}} three scald tanks, from a dip tank located between defeathering machines, and in rinses of carcasses removed from the processing line immediately after defeathering. Mean coliform concentrations in Tanks 1, 2, and 3 were 4. 6, 2. 5, and 1. 6 log 10 (cfu/ml), respectively. E. coli concentrations followed the same pattern with means of 4. 4, 2. 1, and 1. 4 in Tanks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, with significant differences (P< 0. 05) in the concentrations of both coliforms and E. coli between tanks. Mean Campylobacter concentration in four positive samples from Tank 1 was 4. 0 log 10 (cfu/ml), but only one water sample from Tank 2 and none from Tank 3 were Campylobacter positive. Coliforms and E. coli were found in dip tank samples in only two instances, with no isolations of Campylobacter or salmonellae. Mean numbers of coliforms, E. coli, and Campylobacter in carcass rinses were 3. 1, 2. 7, and 3. 3 log 10 (cfu/ml). Salmonellae were isolated from five of six water samples from Tank 1 with a mean MPN of 13. 3 / 100 mL, but were isolated from only three of six water samples from Tank 2 and two of six from Tank 3.

40|$|Abstract: The {{presence}} of Campylobacter spp. on broiler carcasses and in <b>scald</b> tank <b>water</b> {{in a commercial}} poultry processing facility was monitored at monthly intervals from July through December. The spread of the pathogen had previously been monitored in the same facility from January through June of the same year. Campylobacter were enumerated on prescalded, picked, eviscerated, and chilled broiler carcasses; on processed carcasses stored at 4 C for 7 or 14 days, and in <b>scald</b> tank <b>water</b> samples. The fatty acid methylo ester (FAME) profile of the Campylobacter isolates {{and the degree of}} relatedness between the Campylobacter isolates was determined using the MIDI Sherlock Microbial Identification System (MIS). Findings indicated that Campylobacter jejuni was present on carcasses and in <b>scald</b> tank <b>water</b> samples collected from July through December.

Findings indicated that poultry flocks may introduce several strains of C. jejuni into processing facilities.

40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of installing thermostatic mixer valves (TMVs) in reducing risks of bath <b>water</b> <b>scalds</b> and estimate {{the costs of}} avoiding bath <b>water</b> <b>scalds.</b> Methods: The evaluation was undertaken {{from the perspective of}} the UK public sector, and conducted in conjunction with a randomised control trial of TMVs installed in social housing in Glasgow. Installation costs were borne by the social housing organisation, while support materials were provided by the UK NHS. Effectiveness was represented by the number of families with at-risk bath water temperatures pre- and post-installation, and the number of bath scalds avoided as a result of installation. Differences in the number of families with at-risk temperatures between groups were derived from the RCT. Cost-effectiveness was assessed and a series of one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Unit costs associated with installation were calculated to be 13. 68 pound, while costs associated with treating bath <b>water</b> <b>scalds</b> ranged from 25 pound 226 to 71 pound 902. The cost of an avoided bath <b>water</b> <b>scald</b> ranged from net savings to public purse of 1887 pound to 75 pound 520 and at baseline produced a net saving of 3 pound 229 008; that is, 1. 41 pound saved for every 1 pound spent. Conclusion: It is very likely that installing TMVs as standard in social housing in new buildings and major refurbishments accompanied by educational information represents value for money...|$|R
