Financial <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> activity defines the need of changes of the contents, the directions and ways of implementation of the financial relations between subjects of investment activity. Financial <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> activity is carried out via the mechanism {{in the context of}} which these financial relations are settled. For defining the mechanism of financial <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> activity the authors consider the very concept of financial mechanism.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a real option model is adopted {{in order to}} {{evaluate}} the profitability and timing of investment in solar power generation in Sweden. Investment in solar power {{is viewed as a}} call option. The real option pricing model used in this research is based on a binomial framework with discrete time intervals, illustrating the evolution of the value of a potential investment for the installation of solar panels on a commercial rooftop. The empirical analysis in this thesis is built using price data from Statistics Sweden and case-study data provided by the Swedish solar power company Save-by-Solar Sweden AB. The evolution of the electricity price in Sweden is modeled as a stochastic process. A sensitivity analysis concerning several crucial parameters is undertaken in order to investigate their impact on the considered investment project and draw conclusions about the investment potential under different economic scenarios. In this respect, variables considered are volatility, investment cost, discount rate and the level of subsidies supporting investment in solar power generation. The changed variables are the volatility, the investment cost, discount rate and the level of subsidies. The results illustrate the importance of volatility in the electricity price, for the determination of project value and investment timing. The results have also implications for the definition of optimal subsidies for the <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in solar power...|$|E

ABSTRACT: Lending {{represents one of the}} core functions of commercial banking system. The essential role of banks in the economy has been to intermediate funds between surplus and deficit economic units. In the process of carrying out this primary task, banks have found themselves performing a number of functions which include: the mobilization of savings, <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> and economic growth, assistance in resources allocation, boosting of international trade and promotion of the payment system. The few studies which have been conducted on bank lending in Nigeria focused on the pre-consolidation banking era. This study examines the effect of deposit volume on bank lending behaviour in the Nigerian post-consolidation banking period. The population of the study comprises the 22 deposit money banks operating in Nigeria as at December, 2012. Data were obtained from the audited annual reports of the 22 banks for the post-consolidation period of 2006 - 2012. The analysis was conducted using regression analysis with the aid of SPSS package. The results revealed a positive and significant relationship between deposit volume and loan and advances in the selected banks. The study recommends that future researchers should investigate other factors which may exert some influence on the lending behaviour deposit money banks in Nigeria beside deposit volume. Specifically, factors such as capitalization, interest rates, gross domestic product, and liquidity ratio were mentioned...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to improve the management of innovative potential in the field of Housing and Communal Services (HCS) under conditions of establishment of decentralization of the regions and the formation of measures to provide reforms in this area. Theoretical and methodological basis of {{the research}} is the scientific papers and designs of local and foreign authors; the State program of reforming HCS. To achieve the set purpose, we applied general scientific, as well as comparative and analytical methods. The need to manage the innovative potential under conditions of growing competition among national manufacturers in their pursuit of integration into the world economic space was researched. The performed analysis found technical–technological and financial state of HCS in the regions unsatisfactory. Formation of measures to implement the State program of reforming and development of HCS was substantiated. It was demonstrated that the way to engage foreign investments stumbled into certain obstacles, related to the excessive centralization of financial resources and their insufficiency for economic freedom of the regions. Special attention is paid to the fact that innovation activity in Ukraine has low level of development that can be explained by insufficiency of financing of scientific activities (applied research, designs), as well as the lack of incentives for its implementation. Unfavorable macroeconomic situation and the activities of the government bodies to withdraw working capital, increasing taxation burden lead to decrease in innovation activity of enterprises. It was demonstrated that the priority fields of the economy of the state, which need <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> and innovation, also include HCS, which {{remains one of the most}} technically backward industries of the national economy.

There are the regions of Kemerovo, Novosibirsk, Omsk, Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai and the Republic of Khakassia. The subject matter of the research is the state and prospects of the garment industry of the Siberian Federal District. It also includes the assessment of the garment industry as one of the sub-sectors of the light industry in terms of its competitiveness in the domestic market. The purpose of the comprehensive study is to determine the conditions and factors affecting the development of the industry, as well as to identify its development reserves and competitiveness on the basis of industrial cluster’s generation. The hypothesis {{of this study is that}} in the Siberian Federal District, there are a need and reserves to create a cluster of the garment industry. The main methods of the study are the comparative analysis, the expert assessment of the sector in certain regions of the Siberian Federal District, as well as the assessment of possible formation of the industrial cluster in the region. The results of the study are the evaluation of the competitiveness and prospects of the garment industry in Russia and the Siberian Federal District (a low level of development and competitiveness); the evaluation of the development level of the garment industry in the Federal District, which have showed the demand for apparel products from the population and enterprises, as well as the conditions for the provision of clothing manufacture with natural fabrics and synthetic materials, labor resources and research and development achievements; also the justification of the existing potential for development of a sectoral cluster by means of pooling together the productions and economic communications of the Novosibirsk and Omsk regions at the initial stage.

The objective of this article consists of collecting data about different aspects about specific areas of interest of agricultural insurance, preparing the database, a conceptual presentation of a pilot version which will become constantly richer depending on the answers received from agricultural producers, with the clearest exposure of knowledgebase possible. We can justify picking this theme with the fact that even while agricultural insurance plays a very important role in agricultural development, the registered result got from them are modest, reason why solutions need {{to be found in the}} scope of developing the agricultural sector.
