25|$|Short-term data (8 weeks) shows reduced irritability, hyperactivity, {{inappropriate}} speech, and <b>stereotypy,</b> but {{no change}} in lethargic behaviours. Adverse effects include weight gain, sleepiness, drooling and tremors. It is suggested that children and adolescents need to be monitored regularly while taking this medication, to evaluate if this treatment option is still effective after long-term use and note if side effects are worsening. Further {{studies are needed to}} understand if this drug is helpful for children after long term use.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to binding to serotonin receptors, buspirone is an antagonist of the dopamine D2 receptor with weak affinity. It preferentially blocks inhibitory presynaptic D2 autoreceptors, and antagonizes postsynaptic D2 receptors only at higher doses. In accordance, buspirone {{has been found}} to increase dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal pathway at low doses, whereas at higher doses, postsynaptic D2 receptors are blocked and antidopaminergic effects such as hypoactivity and reduced <b>stereotypy,</b> though notably not catalepsy, are observed in animals. Buspirone has also been found to bind with much higher affinity to the dopamine D3 and D4 receptors, where it is similarly an antagonist.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that <b>stereotypies,</b> such as chain {{manipulation}} and excessive drinking, only develop in food-restricted sows. Furthermore, once <b>stereotypies</b> have been developed, ingestion of a small meal specifically stimulates the performance of <b>stereotypies.</b> These {{results suggest that the}} occurrence of <b>stereotypies</b> may strongly depend on the individual's nutritional status. As glucose {{is one of the main}} metabolic fuels, the present experiment investigated whether individual differences and/or daily variations in levels of chain manipulation and excessive drinking are correlated to individual differences and/or daily variations in pre- or postfeeding glucose concentrations. Blood samples were taken at regular intervals prior to, during, and after feeding, from sows that had developed <b>stereotypies</b> to different degrees over a period of 110 days of restrictive housing and feeding conditions. Glucose concentrations were low prior to and high after feeding. Levels of <b>stereotypies</b> showed similar variations, suggesting that the performance of <b>stereotypies</b> is not related to low glucose concentrations. Furthermore, whilst sows differed consistently in glucose concentrations, no correlations were found between individual glucose concentrations and <b>stereotypies.</b> Similarly, no correlations were found between glucose concentrations and chain manipulation or drinking on a sample to sample basis. These data show that although performance of <b>stereotypies</b> is strongly dependent on feeding regime, it is not related to plasma glucose concentrations. ...|$|R

25|$|Brainard & Doupe (2000) posit a {{model in}} which LMAN (of the {{anterior}} forebrain) plays a primary role in error correction, as it detects differences between the song produced by the bird and its memorized song template and then sends an instructive error signal to structures in the vocal production pathway in order to correct or modify the motor program for song production. In their study, Brainard & Doupe (2000) showed that while deafening adult birds led {{to the loss of}} song <b>stereotypy</b> due to altered auditory feedback and non-adaptive modification of the motor program, lesioning LMAN in the anterior forebrain pathway of adult birds that had been deafened led to the stabilization of song (LMAN lesions in deafened birds prevented any further deterioration in syllable production and song structure).|$|E
500|$|Long-term methamphetamine use {{can cause}} parafunctional habits, routine {{actions of a}} body part that are {{different}} than their common use, which can result in tooth wear and exacerbate periodontal diseases. One such habit that may affect the development of meth mouth is bruxism, particularly as the drug's effects wane and <b>stereotypy</b> occurs, a phase that {{is often referred to}} as [...] "tweaking". This bruxism may be due to a drug-induced increase in monoamines. Other behaviors of long-term methamphetamine users that may cause or accelerate the symptoms of meth mouth are the failure to pay attention to oral hygiene and excessive food intake during binges, especially sugary foods; the drug's users often report strong cravings for sugar and consume large amounts of high-sugar beverages. The altered mental state that accompanies methamphetamine use lasts longer than that of some other common drugs, increasing the amount of time the user engages in drug-induced behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Stereotypies may be coping {{mechanisms}} as results suggest from study on tethered and stalled sows. Sows that are tethered and stalled exhibited more stereotypies like licking and rubbing than sows {{that are in}} groups outdoors. This abnormal behavior seems {{to be related to}} opioid (related to the reward system) receptor density. [...] In sows, prolonged confinement, being tethered or being in gestation crates, results in abnormal behaviors and stereotypies. Mu and Kappa receptors are associated with aversion behaviors and Mu receptor density is greater in tethered sows than sows that are in groups outdoors. However, sows with <b>stereotypy</b> behaviors experienced a decrease both in Mu and Kappa receptor density in the brain suggesting that inactivity increases Mu receptor density and <b>stereotypy</b> development decrease both kappa and Mu receptor density.|$|E
40|$|Tethered sows {{continuously}} performed <b>stereotypies</b> {{during a}} substantial part of the day time. A single subcutaneous injection with naloxone significantly decreased the profound <b>stereotypies,</b> while explorative behaviours of pigs were not affected by naloxone. In addition a long-term effect of naloxone was noticed. It is suggested that performing the seemingly purposeless <b>stereotypies</b> may function as an effective strategy in order to cope with the conflict-inducing housing conditions. The present data implicate endorphins in this strategy. The involvement of endorphins in the <b>stereotypies</b> of the sows {{may be related to the}} calming, rewarding and dependency-inducing effects of the endorphins...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>stereotypies</b> was examined in juvenile rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) who, at 2 weeks of postnatal age, received selective bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the amygdala (N � 8) or hippocampus (N � 8). The lesion {{groups were compared}} to age-matched control subjects that received a sham surgical procedure (N � 8). All subjects were maternally reared for the first 6 months and provided access to social groups throughout development. Pronounced <b>stereotypies</b> were not observed {{in any of the}} experimental groups {{during the first year of}} life. However, between 1 to 2 years of age, both amygdala- and hippocampuslesioned subjects began to exhibit <b>stereotypies.</b> When observed as juveniles, both amygdala- and hippocampus-lesioned subjects consistently produced more <b>stereotypies</b> than the control subjects in a variety of contexts. More interesting, neonatal lesions of either the amygdala or hippocampus resulted in unique repertoires of repetitive behaviors. Amygdala-lesioned subjects exhibited more self-directed <b>stereotypies</b> and the hippocampus-lesioned subjects displayed more head-twisting. We discuss these results in relation to the neurobiological basis of repetitive <b>stereotypies</b> in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism...|$|R
25|$|<b>Stereotypies</b> are repetitive, rhythmic, simple {{movements}} {{that can be}} voluntarily suppressed. Like tremors, they are typically back and forth movements, and most commonly occur bilaterally. They often involve fingers, wrists, or proximal portions of the upper extremities. Although, like tics, they can stem from stress and excitement, there is no underlying urge to move associated with <b>stereotypies</b> and these movements can be stopped with distraction. When aware of the movements, the child can also suppress them voluntarily. <b>Stereotypies</b> are often associated with developmental syndromes, including the autism spectrum disorders. <b>Stereotypies</b> are quite common in preschool-aged children {{and for this reason}} are not necessarily indicative of neurological pathology on their own.|$|R
2500|$|Song {{learning}} in juvenile birds occurs in two stages: sensory learning, which involves the juvenile {{listening to the}} father or other conspecific bird and memorizing the spectral and temporal qualities of the song (song template), and sensorimotor learning, which involves the juvenile bird producing its own vocalizations and practicing its song until it accurately matches the memorized song template. During the sensorimotor learning phase, song production begins with highly variable sub-vocalizations called [...] "sub-song", which is akin to babbling in human infants. Soon after, the juvenile song shows certain recognizable characteristics of the imitated adult song, but still lacks the <b>stereotypy</b> of the crystallized song – this is called [...] "plastic song". Finally, {{after two or three}} months of song learning and rehearsal (depending on species), the juvenile produces a crystallized song, characterized by spectral and temporal <b>stereotypy</b> (very low variability in syllable production and syllable order). Some birds, such as zebra finches, which are the most popular species for birdsong research, have overlapping sensory and sensorimotor learning stages.|$|E
2500|$|Stereotypies are repetitive, {{sometimes}} abnormal behaviors like pacing on the perch for birds. There are adaptive stereotypic {{behaviors such}} as grooming in cats and preening in birds. Captive parrots commonly perform a range of stereotypies. These behaviors are repeated identically and lack any function or goal. Captive parrots perform striking oral and locomotor stereotypies like pacing on the perch or repetitive play with a certain toy. Feather picking and loud vocalizations can be stereotypies but are not as rigid and may be reactions to confinement, stress, boredom and loneliness {{as studies have shown}} that parrots that are in cages closest to the door are the most prone to feather pick or scream. Feather picking is not a true <b>stereotypy</b> and is more like hair pulling in human and loud vocalizations or screaming can be a <b>stereotypy</b> but vocalization is part of a parrot's natural behavior. [...] Captive parrots lack sufficient stimulation. Presumably they suffer from lack of companionship and opportunities to forage. [...] Stereotypies can evolve from the social environment for example {{the presence or absence of}} certain social stimuli, social isolation, low feeder space and high stocking density (especially for tail biting in pigs). These behaviors can also be transmitted through social learning. [...] Bank voles, pigeons and pigs when housed next to animals that show stereotypies, pick them up as well as through stimulus enhancement which is what happens in tail biting in pigs and feather pecking by hens.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{observable}} animal behaviors with characteristic, highly conserved patterns. [...] One example is grooming behavior in rats. [...] This behavior {{is defined by}} a specific sequence of actions that does not normally differ between individual rats. [...] The rat first begins by stroking its whiskers, then expands the stroking motion to include the eyes and the ears, finally moving on to lick both sides of its body. [...] Other behaviors may {{be added to the}} end of this chain, but these four actions themselves are fixed. [...] Its ubiquity and high degree of <b>stereotypy</b> suggest that this is a beneficial behavior pattern which has been maintained throughout evolutionary history.|$|E

2500|$|Rats {{have also}} been {{used to test the}} {{possibility}} of a problem with dopamine levels in the brains of animals that exhibit compulsive checking behavior. [...] After treating rats with quinpirole, a chemical that specifically blocks dopamine D2/D3 receptors, compulsive checking of certain locations in an open field increased. [...] Some components of the checking behavior, such as the level of <b>stereotypy</b> in the path animals took to checked locations, the number of checks, and the length of the checks indicated and increase in compulsivity as doses of quinpirole increased; other components, such as the time taken to return from the checked location to the starting point and the time taken to make that trip remained constant after the initial injection throughout the experiment. [...] This means that there might be both all-or-none and a sensitization aspects in the biology of the dopamine deficiency model of OCD. [...] In addition, quinpirole might reduce a sense of satisfaction in the rats after they check a location, causing them to return to that location again and again.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for <b>stereotypy,</b> and different stereotyped behaviors may have different explanations.

50|$|To {{attempt to}} {{eliminate}} <b>stereotypies</b> in captive mink, the National Farm Animal Care Council has implemented regulations on incorporating environmental enrichments into mink cages.

Enrichments may help reduce the onset of <b>stereotypies</b> but rarely decrease or eliminate them. Because of this, enrichments should be introduced early in life as a preventative measure. The National Farm Animal Care Council stated that ‘juvenile female pastel mink raised with access to a nest box performed fewer <b>stereotypies</b> from mid-September to late October than those without access to a nest box.’ Due to this, mink have access year round to a nest box and spend {{the majority of their}} time resting within.

[...] <b>Stereotypies</b> are well known in stabled horses, usually developing as a result of being confined, particularly with insufficient exercise. They are colloquially called stable vices.
