2500|$|The {{meaning of}} {{insolvency}} matters {{for the type}} of legal rule. In general terms insolvency has, since the earliest legislation, depended upon inability to pay debts. The concept is embodied in the Insolvency Act 1986 section 122(1)(f) which states that a court may grant a petition for a company to be wound-up if [...] "the company is unable to pay its debts". This general phrase is, however, given particular definitions depending on the rules for which insolvency is relevant. First, the [...] "cash flow" [...] test for insolvency represented under section 123(1)(e) is that a company is insolvent if [...] "the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due". This is the main test used for most rules. It guides a court in granting a winding-up order or appoints an administrator. The cash flow test also guides a court in declaring transactions by a company to be avoided on the ground they were at an undervalue, were an unlawful preference or created a floating charge for insufficient consideration. The cash flow test is said to be based on a [...] "commercial view" [...] of insolvency, as opposed to a rigid legalistic view. In Re Cheyne Finance plc, involving a <b>structured</b> <b>investment</b> <b>vehicle,</b> Briggs J held that a court could take into account debts that would become payable in the near future, and perhaps further ahead, and whether paying those debts was likely. Creditors may, however, find it difficult to prove in the abstract that a company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Because of this, section 122(1)(a) contains a specific test for insolvency. If a company owes an undisputed debt to a creditor of more than £750, the creditor sends a written demand, but after three weeks the sum is not forthcoming, this is evidence that a company is insolvent. In Cornhill Insurance plc v Improvement Services Ltd a small business was owed money, the debt undisputed, by Cornhill Insurance. The solicitors had repeatedly requested payment, but none had come. They presented a winding up petition in the Chancery Court for the company. Cornhill Insurance's solicitors rushed to get an injunction, arguing that there was no evidence at all that their multi-million business had any financial difficulties. Harman J refused to continue the injunction noting that, if the insurance company had [...] "chosen" [...] not to pay, a creditor was also entitled to choose to present a winding up petition when a debt is undisputed on substantial grounds.|$|E

5000|$|Structured {{investment}} mortgage-related securities {{were the}} rating agencies' [...] "golden goose"—in {{the words of}} one agency manager. [...] Agencies earned as much as three times more for grading these complex products as for corporate bonds, their traditional business. On top of revenue generated for issuing credit ratings, agencies often earned $300,000-500,000 and as much as $1 million to construct a <b>structured</b> <b>investment</b> <b>vehicle.</b> [...] By 2007 the business accounted for just under half of the total ratings revenue and all of the revenue growth for Moody's—one of the largest agencies.

50|$|The Master Liquidity Enhancement Conduit (MLEC), {{also known}} as the Super SIV (<b>structured</b> <b>investment</b> <b>vehicle),</b> was a plan {{announced}} by three major banks based in the United States on October 15, 2007, to help alleviate the subprime mortgage financial crisis. Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America created the plan in an effort to stave off financial damage. Due to a tightening of the credit markets linked to the crisis, a number of structured investment vehicles (SIVs), backed by major banking institutions, found themselves less able to obtain short-term financing on the open market, which they need in order to ensure their continued operations, due to investors concerns about the SIVs exposure to subprime mortgages. Complicating the problem was {{the fact that some of}} the investment securities held by SIVs are valued by a computer model developed by the securities traders and investment banks. The mark to model process is used by all financial institutions where a deep and liquid market does not exist. Many of the securities' valuations can be found in the company's financial report as illiquid and hard to value level 3 assets.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, Professor Frank Partnoy wrote, [...] "certain {{types of}} {{so-called}} 'arbitrage vehicles' demonstrate that companies are purchasing credit ratings for {{something other than}} their informational value. One example is the credit arbitrage vehicle, {{also known as a}} <b>Structured</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (SIV). A typical SIV is a company which seeks to 'arbitrage' credit by issuing debt or debt-like liabilities and purchasing debt or debt-like assets, and earning the credit spread differential between its assets and liabilities. Much of an SIV's portfolio may consist of asset-backed securities." [...] In reality there is no such [...] "arbitrage", the SIV is acting like any old fashioned spread banker, seeking to earn a spread between its income on assets and cost of funds on liabilities. It earns this spread by accepting two types of risk: a credit transformation (lending to AA borrowers while issuing AAA liabilities) and a maturity transformation (borrowing short while lending long). The scale of both transformations were considerably less than traditional banks, and leverage was also typically half to a quarter of that used by banks, so the risks were less and the returns available were also much lower.|$|E
5000|$|Sigma Finance Corporation (Sigma) was {{a limited}} purpose finance company (similar but {{different}} from a <b>structured</b> <b>investment</b> <b>vehicle</b> (SIV)) established to invest in certain types of asset-backed securities and other financial instruments, and aimed {{to profit from the}} difference between the cost of funding its activities and the returns made on its investment portfolio. Its activities were much like a very simplified form of banking, although with less than half the leverage of a traditional bank and without any exposure to interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk. However, due to the impact on the financial markets stemming from the sub-prime mortgage market in the United States of America, on the value of asset backed securities generally, despite Sigma having no exposure to US subprime mortgages, there was a [...] "run" [...] by short term lenders to all non-banks. This resulted in forced selling by many investors at the same time causing the value of Sigma’s assets to fall short of the amount it needed to pay the secured creditors. Following an auction in December 2008 the values achieved fell far short of the amounts required to satisfy the secured creditors, let alone the unsecured creditors. All of Sigma’s assets were secured under a security trust deed (STD) in favour of those creditors investing in and through Sigma.|$|E
