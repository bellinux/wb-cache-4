40|$|Abstract. The <b>straightening</b> of curved slab {{results in}} a greater <b>straightening</b> strain. During the process of {{multi-point}} <b>straightening,</b> the peak value of the <b>straightening</b> strain rate will appear at each <b>straightening</b> point. If the strain rate is too large, the <b>straightening</b> cracks will appear. Solidification and heat transfer of a slab is analyzed and the generation of the solidified shell and the three-dimension temperature field of the slab are calculated by using three-dimensional finite element method (FEM). Based on the finite element analysis of five-point <b>straightening</b> of the curved slab, the strain and strain rate of each <b>straightening</b> point were obtained, which is a base of the analysis of <b>straightening</b> cracks...|$|R

5|$|By 1956, {{the surface}} of RM 2134 had been {{upgraded}} to stone, and the northern portion had been additionally <b>straightened.</b> On December 1, 1957, FM 2134 was extended northeastward across the Colorado River to the community of Voss. By 1961, the portion designated as RM 2134 had been upgraded to a bituminous surface, made of asphalt and crushed rock. The other road segment had been upgraded to a metal surface. In addition, a new bridge had been constructed along the RM 2134 portion, {{and it had been}} <b>straightened</b> generally along the present location of RE11. In 1985, plans were approved for the construction of the Stacey Reservoir. The construction was finished in 1990, and the lake was instead named the O.H. Ivie Reservoir. The construction of the lake destroyed a large portion of RM 2134, and caused the removal of the highway to FM 1929. RE11 was designated on its current location on October 31, 1996, and was officially approved on December 20, 1996. The route remains the most recently designated recreational road.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is {{difficult}} to determine <b>straightening</b> stroke precisely for automatic <b>straightening</b> machines. The existing calculation method of <b>straightening</b> stroke is based on <b>straightening</b> curvature equation. Because the initial curvature is obtained by curve fitting method, the method is inconvenient to use and its accuracy is not well. In this paper, a method to calculate <b>straightening</b> stroke based on <b>straightening</b> process model is put forward. So the mathematic load-deflection model of <b>straightening</b> process must be established at first. The <b>straightening</b> process model for shafts is developed according to the elastic-plastic mechanics theory. By using the model, the <b>straightening</b> stroke can be calculated directly according to the initial deflection of the bent part. It is advantageous to use and to decrease errors. Comparing with FEM results and experimental results, the calculation results by the model are exact and the errors are small. So the validity and the accuracy of the method are verified. It will be helpful to the development of automatic <b>straightening</b> machines...|$|R

5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Danielle Federici, was filmed {{during the early}} summer of 1994. It was filmed in black-and-white, and features Carey walking along the streets of New York, watching several different people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, lonely {{and in need of}} a friend. Additionally, aside from several scenes of Carey and a large church choir in a large antechamber, the video is known as the first video in which Carey appears with <b>straightened</b> hair. Throughout her career up until that point, Carey had famously sported long, auburn curls. However, the video presented Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with bangs and a long <b>straightened</b> hairstyle. The video begins with scenes of Carey walking down a long New York street, with the addition of close ups of Carey's face. As she stares down the road, she witnesses a small girl, sitting alone in an alley corner, glaring into the sky. As the first chorus begins, Carey enters a large foyer, with a choir dressed in black singing perched atop a large staircase. During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who is sitting on a withered stoop.|$|E

40|$|Impacts between over-height {{vehicles}} and steel bridges are common throughout North America {{and the resulting}} bridge damage is unpredictable and sudden. Heat <b>straightening</b> is an alternative to replacing steel members and mechanical <b>straightening</b> for repairs. In many cases, bridges remediated using heat <b>straightening</b> require fewer disruptions to traffic and lower repair costs compared to repairs replacing steel members. Heat <b>straightening</b> limitations and practices have been developed with American steel grades and climates in mind. Often heat <b>straightening</b> is described as an art {{as much as a}} science; this repair method has relied on experienced practitioners using heat <b>straightening</b> patterns designed to cause rotations or shortening in members. Heat <b>straightening</b> of impact-damaged steel bridges can be modelled with finite element analysis (FEA). Heat <b>straightening</b> is a thermo-mechanical process. Existing studies modelling heat <b>straightening</b> with FEA do not fully explain the modelling techniques and material parameters used. A workflow defining steps and material parameters can be used to facilitate modelling of impact and heat <b>straightening</b> on bridges. This study proposes a workflow using FEA to model the heat <b>straightening</b> of impact-damaged steel bridges. The proposed workflow will be used to study heat <b>straightening</b> of CSA 350 W steel – a commonly used Canadian steel grade. The workflow is developed by investigating modelling techniques for impact and heat <b>straightening</b> separately. The developed finite element models include material parameters accounting for work hardening, thermal effects and strain-rate sensitivity of steel. The presented research demonstrates that the proposed workflow is viable for modelling impact and heat <b>straightening</b> of steel bridges. Although this study involved the application of the developed modelling techniques for a hypothetical bridge, the exercise has provided valuable insight into methods of expediting heat <b>straightening</b> repair and the modelling process. For instance, it has provided insight into the following: the introduction of jacking forces without causing mechanical <b>straightening,</b> the removal of plastically deformed stiffeners to reduce deformations, and the treatment of residual stresses from heat <b>straightening...</b>|$|R
