A viable interest-bearing medium must be issued in denominations low enough for day-to-day use, however, and without historical examples of <b>small-denomination</b> interest-bearing issues we cannot properly test whether interest-bearing currency will circulate as legal restrictions theory predicts.

Historically, fiduciary token coins have proven to be the only practical means for addressing the small change problem, whether officially or unofficially. In particular, privately-supplied, fiduciary token coins played a crucial part in Great Britain’s Industrial Revolution, which might not have been possible without them...|$|E

Free bank notes were demanded because they were priced to reflect the expected value of their backing. The empirical evidence supports this explanation. Specifically, in New York, Wisconsin, and Indiana the expected value of backing was sufficient for free bank notes to circulate at par, which they did. In Minnesota the backing for notes was very poor: they exchanged well below par, being treated as <b>small-denomination</b> securities. Free banking; Bank notes...|$|E

Our study is unique in that the primary focus is to identify bank-specific variables explaining significant variations in retail CD yields, thereby enabling more effective revenue management in a broad sense. We find very strong evidence that asset size, the cost of funding earning assets, and the ratio of non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits are the factors characterising those differences. Taken together, it suggests that the large banks with higher cost of funding and lower non-interest-bearing deposit ratio {{would be willing to pay}} the higher prices on their retail CDs, indicating that liquidity would play a prime role in pricing retail CDs. bank-specific factors; CD yields; microstructure; revenue management; retail pricing; CD pricing; certificates of deposit; commercial banking; USA; United States; liquidity. ...|$|E
