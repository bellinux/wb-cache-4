50|$|The German {{physicist}} Walter H. Schottky formulated {{a theory}} predicting the Schottky effect, {{which led to}} the Schottky diode and later Schottky transistors. For the same power dissipation, Schottky transistors have a faster switching speed than conventional transistors because the Schottky diode prevents the transistor from saturating and storing charge; see Baker clamp. Gates built with Schottky transistors use more power than normal TTL and switch faster. With Low-power Schottky (LS), internal resistance values were increased to reduce power consumption and increase switching speed over the original version. The introduction of Advanced Low-power Schottky (ALS) further increased speed and reduced power consumption. A faster logic family called FAST (Fairchild Advanced <b>Schottky</b> <b>TTL)</b> (Schottky) (F) was also introduced that was faster than normal <b>Schottky</b> <b>TTL.</b>|$|E
40|$|A period {{timing device}} {{suitable}} for processing laser Doppler anemometer signals {{has been described}} here. The important features of this instrument are: it is inexpensive, simple to operate, and easy to fabricate. When the concentration of scattering particles is low the Doppler signal {{is in the form}} of a burst and the Doppler frequency is measured by timing the zero crossings of the signal. But the presence of noise calls for the use of validation criterion, and a 5 – 8 cycles comparison has been used in this instrument. Validation criterion requires the differential count between the 5 and 8 cycles to be multiplied by predetermined numbers that prescribe the accuracy of measurement. By choosing these numbers to be binary numbers, much simplification in circuit design has been accomplished since this permits the use of shift registers for multiplication. Validation accuracies of 1. 6 %, 3. 2 %, 6. 3 %, and 12. 5 % are possible with this device. The design presented here is for a 16 -bit processor and uses TTL components. By substituting <b>Schottky</b> barrier <b>TTLs</b> the clock frequency can be increased from about 10 to 30 MHz resulting in an extension in the range of the instrument.

50|$|In 1964, Dr. Biard {{designed}} linear transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) to {{work with}} silicon photodiodes for receiving optical signals generated by LEDs. When the signal current from the silicon photodiode was too large, the input stage of the amplifier would saturate and cause undesirable delays when the optical signal was removed. Dr. Biard solved this problem by connecting a silicon HP Schottky diode across the collector-base junction of the input transistor. Since the Schottky diode had a lower forward drop than the transistor PN junction, the transistor did not saturate and the undesirable delay time was eliminated. The engineer in the next office at the SRD Lab was developing Diode Transistor Logic (DTL) ICs and also having saturation problems. Dr. Biard decided to use what he learned with the optical receiver amplifiers and apply that to the bipolar logic circuits. On December 31, 1964, Dr. Biard filed a patent for the Schottky transistor (U.S. Patent US3463975), a.k.a. the Schottky-clamped transistor, which consisted of a transistor and an internal metal-semiconductor Schottky-barrier diode. The patent was filed based on Schottky Clamped DTL monolithic integrated logic circuits using aluminum-silicon Schottky diodes across the collector-base junctions of the transistors and in the input to adjust the logic levels. The diode prevented the transistor from saturating by minimizing the forward bias on the collector-base transistor junction, thus reducing the minority carrier injection to a negligible amount. The Schottky diode could be integrated on the same die, it had a compact layout, it had no minority carrier charge storage, and it was faster than a conventional junction diode. Dr. Biard's patent was filed before Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) circuits had been invented, yet it was written broadly {{enough to cover the}} <b>Schottky</b> clamped <b>TTL</b> ICs using platinum silicide Schottky diodes, which were much more predictable and manufacturable than the aluminum Schottky diodes he originally used. His patent ultimately improved the switching speed of saturated logic designs, such as the Schottky-TTL, at a low cost. In 1985, Dr. Biard received the Patrick E. Haggerty Innovation Award for this patent.|$|R
5000|$|Low-power <b>Schottky</b> <b>TTL</b> (LS) - {{used the}} higher {{resistance}} values of low-power TTL and the Schottky diodes {{to provide a}} good combination of speed (9.5ns) and reduced power consumption (2 mW), and PDP of about 20 pJ. Probably {{the most common type}} of TTL, these were used as glue logic in microcomputers, essentially replacing the former H, L, and S sub-families.|$|E
50|$|A bipolar {{junction}} transistor with a Schottky barrier between the base and the collector {{is known as a}} Schottky transistor. Because the junction voltage of the Schottky barrier is small, the transistor is prevented from saturating too deeply, which improves the speed when used as a switch. This is the basis for the Schottky and Advanced <b>Schottky</b> <b>TTL</b> families, as well as their low power variants.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method that}} was {{familiar}} in discrete-device logic circuits used a diode and a resistor, a germanium and a silicon diode, or three diodes {{in a negative}} feedback arrangement. These diode networks known as various Baker clamps reduced the voltage applied to the base as the collector approached saturation. Because the transistor went less deeply into saturation, the transistor accumulated fewer stored charge carriers. Therefore, less time was required to clear stored charge during transistor turn off. A low-voltage diode arranged to prevent saturation of the transistor was applied to integrated logic families by using Schottky diodes, as in <b>Schottky</b> <b>TTL.</b>|$|E
50|$|Storage {{time can}} be {{eliminated}} and propagation delay can be reduced by keeping the switching transistors from saturating. Schottky transistors prevent saturation and the stored base charge. A Schottky transistor places a Schottky diode between the base and collector of the transistor. As the transistor comes close to saturating, the Schottky diode conducts and shunts any excess base drive to the collector. (This saturation avoidance technique {{is used in the}} 1956 Baker clamp.) The resulting transistors, which do not saturate, are Schottky transistors. The <b>Schottky</b> <b>TTL</b> logic families (such as S and LS) use Schottky transistors in critical places.|$|E

40|$|Unlike low-power, metal-gate CMOS, {{high-speed}} 54 HC/ 74 HC devices readily drive {{long cable}} runs and backplanes. While the family maintains CMOS’s traditional noise immunity, you must watch transmission-line effects in such applications. Because of 54 HC/ 74 HC high-speed CMOS’s short propagation delays and fast {{rise and fall}} times, you must understand its transmission-line behavior when driving lines as short as even a foot or two, whether those lines are coaxial cables, twisted pairs or backplanes.
