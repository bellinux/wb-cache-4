5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was a façade built onto {{the front of a}} semitruck and was used for filming close shots of the vault destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel <b>self-drive</b> vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and dragged through the streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who had to wear a temperature controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where the vault tumbled as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the vault during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen the vault hanging {{over the edge of the}} Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers would not be able to support the vault's weight.|$|E

40|$|Automated driving has {{experienced}} a research renaissance over the last decade. As a research community, we have been motivated by the opportunity to increase safety, increase mobility, and improve the experience of mobility. Some of the key advancements that have shaped the field over this time period have been the advancement and application of machine learning, advancements in large scale mapping, improved LIDAR and RADAR sensing capability, and more recently, {{a deeper understanding of}} the human factors that will influence the form by which this technology comes to market. Why <b>Self-Driving</b> Vehicles? In the United State, the leading cause of death for individuals aged 4 - 34 is traffic accidents (Hoyert, 2012). We kill over 30, 000 people each year on our roads, and 90 + % of these accidents are due to human error. The importance of personal mobility in our society is such that when individuals lose the privilege of driving, and lose social connections it enables, their life expectancy drops precipitously (Edwards, 2009). The ability to move through cities is decreasing as more and more users, longing for individual automobile mobility, flood roadways.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the conditions that}} produce a phase transition from an ordered to a disordered state {{in a family of}} models of two-dimensional elements with a ferromagnetic-like interaction. This family is defined to contain under the same framework, among others, the XY-model and the <b>Self-Driven</b> Particles Model introduced by Vicsek et al. Each model is distinguished only by the rules that determine the set of elements with which each element interacts. We propose a new member of the family: the vectorial network model, in which a given frac-tion of the elements interact through direct random connections. This model is analogous to an XY-system on a network, and as such can be of interest {{for a wide range of}} problems. It captures the main aspects of the interaction dynamics that produce the phase transition in other models of the family. The network approach allows us to show analytically the existence of a phase transition in this vectorial network model, and to compute its relevant parameters for the case in which all elements are randomly connected. Finally we study numerically the conditions required for a phase transition to exist for different members of the family. Our results show that a qualitatively equivalent phase transition appears whenever even a small amount of long-range interactions are present (or built over time), regardless of other equilibrium or non-equilibrium proper-ties of the system.

There are companies working with this technology today and have already demonstrated a prototype of those self-driving vehicles, one of those companies is Google.

The DARPA Grand Challenge was created to gather skilled developers from around the world to compete with their automated cars. In this paper we focused on the efficiency part in automated parking by studying the sensors mounted on and around the vehicle. The sensors will be analyzed systematically by injecting noise data and also skipped sensor data. The vehicle will be tested with different parking scenarios in a simulating environment and the outcome of the tests will be verified by using an Automated Theorem Prover called “Vampire Theorem Prover” to draw conclusion according to the results. To determine the ground truth, we ran 100 test with different parking scenarios from which we got a subset of 58 scenarios at which the car parked successfully according to the specification while using 100 % sensor quality. Selecting ten scenarios from the ground truth, we ran the tests with different noise levels and observe the parking accuracy.

40|$|Invited talk at Google <b>Self-Driving</b> Cars, Mountain View, May 12 th 2015 Modern cars {{include more}} and more {{sophisticated}} electronics, sensors, processing and control components. These new components are used both for controlling the main functions of the vehicle and for providing the driver with Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). Such ADAS functionalities are increasingly based on Robotics technologies for partly automating some driving functions such as adaptive cruise control, acceleration/braking in a traffic lane, lane keeping, parking assistance, or even simple collision avoidance or mitigation actions (including braking or airbag actuation). Most of the automotive constructors are now proposing ADAS options, {{and the degree of}} autonomy of cars is progressively increasing. But the ultimate challenge addressed by many Academic and Industrial Research Laboratories is the development of driverless cars. Impressive results have already been published and largely disseminated through the media, and manyannouncements concerning the future deployment of such vehicles have been done by most of the major Automotive Manufacturers and by multinational groups such as Google. This talk addresses both the socio-economic and technical issues which are behind the development of the next cars generation. These future cars will include both smart ADAS and Driverless Car functionalities. In the talk, an emphasis will be put on three main enablingtechnologies: (1) Robust Multi-sensors Embedded Perception system, (2) Situation Awareness & Collision Risk assessment in complex traffic situations, and (3) Decisional and Control System for generating safe Navigation and Maneuvering actions. All theses functionalities have to be robust in the presence of sensing errors, uncertainty and traffic hazards. It will be shown that “Bayesian Perception” and “Bayesian Decision” are two key paradigms for developing the above mentioned functionalities. Experimental results obtained on real equipped vehicles provided by Toyota and by Renault will be used to illustrate the talk...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of <b>Self-Driving</b> Vehicles (SDVs) is fast, and new pilots and tests are released every week. SDVs are predicted {{to have the}} potential to change mobility, human life and society. In literature, both negative and positive effects of SDVs are listed (Litman 2015; Fagnant and Kockelman 2015). Among the positive effects are increased traffic throughput leading to less congestion, improved mobility for people without a driver’s license, decreased need for parking spaces, and SDV as an enabler for shared mobility. On the other hand, SDVs are expected to increase the consumption of transport which leads to an increase in total vehicle kilometers travelled. This effect is further reinforced by empty vehicles driving around. This will increase the number of vehicles on the streets and lead to more congestion and increased energy usage. Since the SDV technology is expensive, segregation may be a consequence of the development. In addition there are several challenges related to for example legislation, standardization, infrastructure investments, privacy and security. The question is not if, but rather when SDVs will be common on our streets and roads, and if they will change our way of living, and if so, how? As we are in a potential mobility shift, and decisions made today will affect the future development, understanding possibilities and challenges for the future is important for many stakeholders. To this end a scenario-based future study was performed to derive a common platform for initiation of future research and innovation projects concerning SDVs in Sweden. This study will also be used in the ongoing governmental investigation about future regulations for SDVs on Swedish roads (Bjelfvenstam 2016). A third motivation for the study is to shed light on how demography, geography and political landscape can affect the {{development of}} new mobility services. Since there are many different forces that drive the development, often uncertain and sometimes in conflict with each other, a scenario planning approach was chosen. In previous studies, different types of predictions have been derived. Most of them are made by US scholars and are therefore naturally focused on the development in the US. The culture, both with respect to urban planning and public transport is different in Europe compared to the US. The work has been performed by an expert group and a smaller analysis team. The expert group has involved nearly 40 persons from 20 transport organizations, including public authorities, lawyers, city planners, researchers, transport service suppliers, and vehicle manufacturers. The expert group met three times, each time focusing on a specific theme: 1) trend analysis, 2) defining scenario axes of uncertainty, and 3) consequence analysis. The analysis team, consisting of the present three authors and two future strategists, has analyzed, refined and condensed the material from the expert group. During the project certain trends and strategic uncertainties were identified by the expert group. The uncertainties that were identified as most important for the development of SDVs in Sweden are: 1) whether the sharing economy becomes a new norm or not, and 2) whether city planners, authorities and politicians will be proactive in the development of cities and societies or not, especially regarding the transportation system. This led to four scenarios: A) “Same, same but all the difference” – a green, individualistic society, B) “Sharing is the new black” – a governmentally driven innovation society based on sharing, C) “Follow the path” – an individualistic society based on development {{in the same direction as}} today, and D) “What you need is what you get” – a commercially driven innovation society where sharing is a key. In the paper, we describe the scenarios and the process to derive them in more detail. We also present an analysis of the consequences for the development of SDVs in the four scenarios, including predictions concerning pace of development, level of self-driving, fleet size, travel demand and vehicle kilometers travelled. The paper also includes a discussion and comparison with other studies on the development of SDVs in the US, Europe and Asia. QC 20170627 </p...|$|R
