This contribution presents a sensitive method of tune determination using data of Beam Position Monitor (BPM) measured in bunch-by-bunch manner. The signals induced in the BPM electrodes were digitized by 125 MS/s and integrated {{for each individual}} bunch. The tune was determined by Fourier transformation of the position data for typically 512 subsequent turns. Coherent betatron oscillations were excited with bandwidth-limited white noise.

Since high-resolution, three-dimensional (3 D) imaging of the mouse requires long scan times for <b>satisfactory</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (SNR) and image quality, motion-related artifacts are likely {{over much of the}} body and limit applications of mouse MRI. In this investigation, we explored the use of self-gated imaging methods and image coregistration for improving image quality in the presence of motion. Self-gated signal results from a modified 3 D gradient-echo sequence showed detection of periodic respiratory and cardiac motion in the adult mouse—with excellent comparison to traditional measurements, sensitivity to respiration-induced tissue changes in the brain, and even detection of embryonic cardiac motion in utero. Serial image coregistration with rapidly-acquired, low-SNR volumes further enabled detection and correction of bulk changes in embryo location during in utero imaging sessions and subsequent reconstruction of high-quality images. These methods, in combination, are shown to expand the range of applications for 3 D mouse MRI, enabling late-stage embryonic heart imaging and introducing the possibility of longitudinal developmental studies from embryonic stages through adulthood...|$|E

We perform a systematic survey of such correlated radio and hard X-ray (HXR) pulses with timescales of less than or approximately 2 s in flares simultaneously observed with the radio spectrometer Ikarus and the Hard X-Ray Burst Spectrometer (HXRBS) on solar maximum mission (SMM).

The major findings of this study are presented. These observations strongly suggest that particle acceleration in solar flares occurs in a pulsed mode where electron beams are simultaneously injected in upward and downward directions. Since the sequences of correlated HXR and radio bursts show identical durations and intervals at the two wavelengths, they are believed to reflect most directly the temporal dynamics of the underlying common accelerator. As a consequence, thick-target models should be reconsidered under the aspect of electron injection with pulse durations of 0. 2 - 2. 0 s and duty cycles of approximately = 50 %...|$|E
40|$|Concepts {{for future}} {{spaceborne}} radar systems {{are being developed}} which rely on the transmitter and receiver(s) being carried on separate spacecraft. The potential advantages include lower cost than current spaceborne radars and improved measurement capability. This paper reviews two currently proposed systems: GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) and a geosynchronous synthetic aperture radar constellation (GeoSAR). GNSS-R uses reflections of signals from GPS (and Galileo when available) to measure the height and state of the ocean surface. The receiver is typically in a low Earth obit (LEO) and provides global coverage. GeoSAR uses a radar receiver in geosynchronous orbit (slightly displaced from geostationary but still with a period of 1 day). The radar sees a fixed region of the Earth {{and is able to}} integrate signals over long periods to obtain a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio.</b> If several receiver spacecraft are used simultaneously the time to obtain an image can be reduced in proportion to the number of spacecraft used. The principles of these two systems are described and then requirements applying to the system dynamics and control are derived. For GNSS-R the requirements are relatively easy to achieve (coarse pointing and only basic orbit control). GeoSAR’s requirements are more demanding although the environmental disturbances at geosynchronous orbit height are significantly smaller than in LEO. For GeoSAR the most demanding requirement is the need for centimetre-level orbit measurements to allow aperture synthesis to be implement...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the design}} and {{underpinning}} technical principles of the novel design of a negative pressure wave (NPW) -based pipeline leak detection (PLD) system has been reported, which is configured using Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) pressure sensors. To evaluate this, a pipeline leakage test platform has been established and experiments have been conducted, to verify {{the performance of a}} system using this FBG-based approach. The results show that a system using FBG-based sensors can accurately determine the pressure change trends along the pipeline and thus allow the calculation of the NPW velocity online. A key comparison is made with traditional NPW detection techniques, showing that the novel detection system is capable of achieving the higher leak-location accuracy and the detection of smaller leakage volumes. This arises from the ability of the FBG-based system to allow an increased number of sensors to be multiplexed along the pipeline. Their corresponding output signals generated show a very <b>satisfactory,</b> high <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio.</b> The system has been evaluated, especially in its response to extraneous signals and thus disturbances caused by the pump starting or stopping can be eliminated.

The purpose of this prospective, anatomic study was to describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) anatomy of the normal canine femoral and sciatic nerves and to define the sequences in which the nerves are best depicted. A preliminary postmortem cadaver study was performed to determine optimal sequences and imaging protocol. In a second step the optimized technique was implemented on 10 healthy Beagle dogs, included in the study. The applied protocol included the following sequences: T 1 -weighted, T 2 -weighted, T 2 -Spectral Attenuated Inversion Recovery, T 1 -weighted postcontrast and T 1 -Spectral Presaturated Inversion Recovery postcontrast.

40|$|Critical flight {{hardware}} typically {{undergoes a}} series of nondestructive evaluation methods to screen for defects before it is integrated into the flight system. Conventionally, pressure vessels have been inspected for flaws using a technique known as fluorescent dye penetrant, which is biased to inspector interpretation. An alternate method known as eddy current is automated and can detect small cracks better than dye penetrant. A new multipurpose pressure vessel scanner has been developed to perform internal and external eddy current scanning, laser profilometry, and thickness mapping on pressure vessels. Before this system can be implemented throughout industry, a probability of detection (POD) study needs to be performed to validate the systems eddy current crack/flaw capabilities. The POD sample set will consist of 6 flight-like metal pressure vessel liners with defects of known size. Preparation for the POD includes sample set fabrication, system operation, procedure development, and eddy current settings optimization. For this, collaborating with subject matter experts was required. This technical paper details the preparation activities {{leading up to the}} POD study currently scheduled for winter 2015 / 2016. Once validated, this system will be a proven innovation for increasing the safety and reliability of necessary flight hardware. Additionally, testing of frangible joint requires Photon Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) and Digital Image Correlation instrumentation. There is often noise associated with PDV data, which necessitates a frequency modulation (FM) signal-to-noise pre-test. Generally, FM radio works by varying the carrier frequency and mixing it with a fixed frequency source, creating a beat frequency which is represented by audio frequency that can be heard between about 20 to 20, 000 Hz. Similarly, PDV reflects a shifted frequency (a phenomenon known as the Doppler Effect) from a moving source and mixes it with a fixed source frequency, which results in a beat frequency. However, for PDV, discerning the signal from the noise is difficult without a moving source to induce the modulation. A rotating wheel is currently being used as the moving source but its configuration is impractical and has cumbersome placement inside the current frangible joint test cell. As a way to combat this problem and verify a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio,</b> a reflective moving crystal piezo will be used to modulate a beat frequency, and an absorptive target will be used to block the signal in order to determine any back reflection coming from the probe and discern the true signal-to noise ratio. The piezo will be mounted and inserted onto the test table on an extendable telescopic antenna grounded by a magnetic base in the test zone. This piezo configuration will be more compatible within the test zone and allow for easy removal of the disk following acceptable signal verification and prior to frangible joint tests.

The need for higher temporal and spatial recording resolutions imposes new challenges {{on the design of}} integrated neural interfaces with respect to power consumption, data handling and versatility. The primary goal of this thesis is to design and implement low-power, high-performance integrated circuits and systems for the accurate recording of in vivo neural signals. In this thesis, two different neural recording systems were implemented and validated. The first prototype implements an integrated acquisition system for in vitro and in vivo applications. The ASIC consists of 16 low-noise, fully-differential input channels with independently programmable amplification (from 100 to 6000) and filtering (1 - 6000 Hz range) capabilities. Each channel is AC-coupled and implements a fourth-order band-pass filter in order to steeply attenuate out-of-band noise and DC input offsets. The system achieves an input-referred noise density of 37 nV/sqrt(Hz), a NEF of 5. 1, a CMRR > 60 dB, a THD > 1 % and a sampling rate of 30 kS/s per channel, while consuming a maximum of 70 uA per channel from a single 3. 3 V supply. The ASIC was implemented in a 0. 35 um CMOS technology and has a total area of 5. 6 x 4. 5 mm 2. The recording system was successfully validated in in vitro and in vivo experiments, achieving simultaneous multichannel recordings of cell activity with <b>satisfactory</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios.</b> The second prototype focuses on the implementation of a full-CMOS active neural probe, which was fabricated in a 0. 18 um CMOS technology. Power and area optimizations were the main targets in this implantable device. The neural probe has 455 recording electrodes and 52 recording channels. Underneath each electrode there is in situ amplification and AC coupling. The recording channels have independent programmable amplifiers and filters to process the analog signals coming from the electrodes. The probe also includes integrated ADCs and a digital serial interface (SPI) for data transferring. The design achieves an input-referred noise density of 44 nV/sqrt(Hz), a sampling rate of 30 kS/s per channel and a resolution of 10 bits, while consuming a total power of 17. 7 uW per channel from a single 1. 8 V supply. The body of the probe occupies an area of 2. 9 x 3. 2 mm 2. The complete functionality of this neural probe was successfully demonstrated in in vivo experiments, achieving massive parallel recording of neural signals.

40|$|Abstract — Steganography {{method used}} in this paper is based on {{biometric}}s. And the biometric feature used to implement steganography is skin tone region of images [1]. Communication of data by maintaining confidentiality is a major issue everywhere, so to increase the security a non – conventional approach called steganography is proposed. “Steganography ” is an art of “hiding data within data ” [1, 2]. In general, Stego means “covering ” and graphic means “writing”. Combining these two terms gives the meaning of steganography, i. e. “covered writing” [2]. Here secret data is embedded within skin region of image that will provide an excellent secure location for data hiding. For this skin tone detection is performed using HSV (Hue, Saturation and Value) color space. Additionally secret data embedding is performed using frequency domain approach- DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform). In DWT Different techniques are used. Secret data is hidden {{in one of the}} high frequency sub-band of DWT by tracing skin pixels in that sub-band. Different steps of data hiding are applied by cropping an image interactively. Cropping results into an enhanced security than hiding data without cropping i. e. in whole image, so cropped region works as a key at decoding side.

40|$|Herpes Simplex Virus type- 1 (HSV- 1) {{is one of}} {{the eight}} human herpes viruses and it causes cold sores in {{infected}} individuals. HSV- 1 infects epithelial cells, then travels to the trigeminal ganglion through retrograde transport in the peripheral neurons. During the initial lytic infection in the epithelial host cell, HSV- 1 hijacks cellular RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) to sites of viral transcription for viral gene expression. Previous studies have found an intermediately phosphorylated form of RNAP II in HSV- 1 infected cells starting approximately 5 hours post infection. This intermediately phosphorylated form of RNAP II appeared to be different from the usual hypo- and hyperphosphorylated forms of RNAP II normally found in uninfected cells. Subsequent studies had revealed that at late time in HSV- 1 infection, elongating RNAP II, marked by phosphorylated serine 2 residues at the C-terminal domain (CTD), was degraded in infected cells, and this degradation could be prevented by inhibiting transcription. The loss of elongating RNAP II was in contrast to the high levels of viral transcription that occurs during late phase of HSV- 1 replication cycle. We have previously proposed a collision model where the compact viral genome becomes overburdened by the high transcriptional activities at late time in HSV- 1 infection, leading to arrested RNAP II complexes that then in turn, trigger a proteasome-mediated proteolysis of the polymerase to resolve stalled transcription. In this body of work, we first attempted to determine the if HSV- 1 transcription is more similar to cellular transcription in that it requires phosphoserine- 2 form of RNAP II and found that when we inhibited cdk 9, the kinase responsible for phosphorylating serine 2 residues of the RNAP II CTD, viral transcription was also inhibited. Viral yield under cdk 9 inhibition was also dramatically reduced, supporting the idea that like cellular transcription, HSV- 1 transcription requires phosphoserine- 2 form of RNAP II. We also attempted to substantiate our RNAP II collision model by assessing RNAP II occupancy on the HSV- 1 genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. In our ChIP qPCR analysis of an Early HSV- 1 gene cluster, we found that though ChIP signals from one of the antibodies were consistent with known expression patterns of the genes, we were unable to validate the results with phosphoform-specific ChIP results due to the high noise levels of these phosphoform-specific antibodies. When analyzing a Late HSV- 1 gene cluster, we were unable to achieve <b>satisfactory</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> regardless of the antibody used. Therefore we were unsuccessful to support or refute our collision model at this time. Lastly, we investigated a possible link between HSV- 1 induced RNAP II degradation and the cellular transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway by examining the role of a general transcription factor TFIIS, a factor known to stimulate transcription after RNAP II becomes stalled, in HSV- 1 transcription. Our initial immunofluorescence studies had shown that one of the isoforms of TFIIS (TCEA 2) appeared to re-localize to HSV- 1 transcription replicative compartments in infected cells. Subsequent confocal microscopy co-location studies however, showed a rather inconsistent localization patterns among the isoforms of TFIIS. When attempting to perform functional knock-down experiments of each of the TFIIS isoforms, we found that the antibodies we were using exhibited cross-reactivity to unknown antigens in Western blot analysis. More importantly, these antibodies failed to recognize FLAG-tagged TFIIS transiently expressed in HeLa cells, thereby overturning our initial re-localization results. At this time, we do not have evidence that support a functional involvement of TFIIS in HSV- 1 transcription. We believe that further experimentation would be required to support our colliding RNAP II model during HSV- 1 lytic infection...|$|R

Due to this fact, it is generally concluded {{that there is a}} relationship between <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> and diffraction efficiency. In this paper we show experimentally that by correctly choosing the photochemical process to be used, the <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> can be improved without producing a decrease in diffraction efficiency. As a final conclusion, we suggest the possibility of obtaining diffuse object holograms with a diffraction efficiency of 25 % and a <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> of 100.

There are mathematical procedures that can make use of this high <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> to calculate spectroscopic parameters of prime importance to the spectroscopist: the positions and intensities of individual absorption bands. In this manuscript we describe, in theory and practice, two such techniques, Fourier self-deconvolution and Fourier derivation, both of which achieve band-narrowing {{at the expense of the}} <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio.</b> Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
