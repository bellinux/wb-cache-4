40|$|To {{become a}} {{proficient}} reader, {{children have to}} learn mappings between print, sound and meaning. There is debate over whether reading instruction {{should focus on the}} relations between print and sound, as in phonics, or on the relationship between print and meaning, as in sight word reading. In a study where participants learned a novel artificial orthography, Taylor, Davis and Rastle (submitted) compared print to <b>sound</b> <b>focused</b> or print to meaning focused reading training, demonstrating that sound training was superior for learning to read. However, a benefit from <b>sound</b> <b>focused</b> training is likely dependent on prior acquisition of effective sound to meaning relations of words. To explore this issue, we developed a connectionist model of reading. We exposed the model to a sound or a meaning focused training, but varied the model’s pre-acquired oral language skills. The simulation results showed that proficiency in oral language is a determinant of the advantage of print to <b>sound</b> <b>focused</b> reading training, indicating that reading training should address both oral language skills and print to sound mappings...|$|R

By using Kirchhoff scalar diffraction theorem, it shows {{possibility of a}} light weight low frequency <b>sound</b> <b>focus</b> lens, which is made of using RSM. Intensity spectra were generated by the model program which was deduced from Kirchhoff scalar diffraction theorem. Meanwhile, the investigation of new RSM compositions was conducted. A tuned zoneplate with size 0. 82 m x 0. 82 m was then fabricated, with rectangular phase step zones. Each has variation within ± 2 ° with its optimized frequency 460 Hz. The open field test was performed. Several intensity spectra were obtained and they showed positive evidence towards <b>sound</b> <b>focusing</b> of the zoneplate...|$|R
