In all cases, the Directors or Proprietors {{of each of the}} individual companies became Directors of ESCC. While some of the individual companies had previously only been involved with the manufacture of <b>sewing</b> <b>cotton,</b> Bagley & Wright had many other interests including yarn for weaving, fishing-net twine, crochet yarn etc. The Bagley & Wright business split into two; one part being subsumed into ESCC with Benjamin and Ralph as Directors, the other part staying independent. In effect, the ESCC was a 'holding company' and each of the fourteen companies within it maintained their own name and style of management.|$|E

5000|$|In 1897 Masson Mill {{became part}} of the English <b>Sewing</b> <b>Cotton</b> Company.

40|$|In the {{presented}} {{study the}} effect of laundering {{on the quality of}} <b>sewn</b> <b>cotton</b> and bamboo plain woven fabrics was investigated considering both the textile parameters and the type of chemical treatment. Quality parameters of <b>sewn</b> <b>cotton</b> and bamboo woven fabrics such as: fabric strength, seam strength and seam slippage at the moment of 4  mm seam opening were evaluated before and after washing with “Tide” washing powder without softeners or with softeners: “Surcare” and “Pflege Weicspuler”. There was also determined surface density, warp and weft densities as well as thicknesses under the pressures 0. 625  kPa and 3. 125  kPa, and calculated the comparative thickness that was considered as softness or porosity of fabrics. Notwithstanding that both the investigated fabrics were cellulosic their behavior after laundering was different. Under the tested conditions, unwashed and laundered with or without chemical softeners cotton fabric didn’t demonstrate seam slippage. The seam slippage resistance of laundered without or with softener specimens of bamboo fabric was increased in respect to control fabric. The larger changes in seam efficiency and seam strength because of laundering were determined for bamboo woven fabric then for cotton fabric. They could be influenced by the higher changes in bamboo fabric’s structure. The highest difference between the structure parameters of both fabrics was determined for comparative thickness. It was significantly increased for cotton fabric and decreased for bamboo fabric after chemical softening comparing to untreated fabrics. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R

5000|$|Through Jongeriuslab, she {{produces}} various {{collections of}} textiles, crockery and furniture. Her design focuses on combining opposites; for example, {{new technology and}} handmade objects, industrial manufacturing and craftsmanship, and the traditional and the contemporary. Her works are often highly textural; for example, rough edged leather is rolled up to create wheels, paint is splashed on earthenware, ceramics are <b>sewn</b> onto <b>cotton</b> tablecloths, sinks are made of rubber. Jongerius prefers working with textiles {{so that she can}} practice her creativity without making a new product from scratch. According to New York Times design critic Alice Rawsthorn, Jongerius' [...] "greatest achievement is bringing sensuality and sophistication to the sanitary industrial design".|$|R

5000|$|Beginning in 1980, James {{began to}} create his own striped yardage by <b>sewing</b> strips of <b>cotton</b> and silk {{together}} in sets of graduated colors, a development that would drive his work for the next fifteen years. The pieces for his quilt tops were cut from the stripped panels, adding complexity to the repetitive block patterns. The panels had to be assembled entirely by machine as the hand-sewn strips tended to unravel when cut across the seams. The quilting, which was sewn in the [...] "ditch" [...] between the strips, was also done by machine.|$|R

The reference is signed by R. Sagar for Bagley & Wright. In 1895, the company's <b>sewing</b> <b>cotton</b> business was still expanding and a considerable investment {{was made in the}} extension of the Belgrave Mill to provide greater manufacturing capacity. In 1895 several British producers of <b>sewing</b> <b>cotton</b> yarn opened discussions on how they might combine their assets and markets to protect themselves from increasing competition from overseas. The companies decided to form a 'conglomerate' through which they would be {{in a better position to}} cooperate on the purchase of raw material and the combined marketing of their products. The aim was to cooperate rather than compete.|$|E

Well, fashion or no fashion, I don't believe there's {{anything}} prettier for a spare-room bed than a nice apple-leaf spread, that's what. I must see about getting them bleached. I've had them <b>sewed</b> up in <b>cotton</b> bags ever since Thomas died, and no doubt they're an awful color. But there's a month yet, and dew-bleaching will work wonders." ...|$|R
50|$|There was a {{shift in}} artistic endeavors within {{the latter part of}} her career. In a 2015 {{interview}} by Estelle Pigot, Maddison expresses her concerns for the news on public broadcasting channels, which she believes cause a drift in the community. Her focus now resides mainly in the unknown stories that unite people as well as themes of death, decay, and mortality. Although she started with photography, Maddison now also use the mediums of textiles, sculptures, and the moving-image. Some of her experimental works in 2009, belonging to a project called There is a time, include: 'Dead to the world', inkjet print on cotton/silk fabric, found fabric flowers <b>sewn</b> with <b>cotton</b> thread, 'Coming to the Monaro', silent video loop, 'The day I left my garden #1 & #2', perspex, glass, wood, neon light, with pressed and dried flowers on paper and 'There is a time', 2009, archival pigment prints on 100% cotton rag.|$|R
