This time, Calgary had to survive a scare of its own, <b>shaking</b> <b>off</b> the Monday Night Miracle at the St. Louis Arena. Trailing by a score of 5–2 with 10 minutes to play in the third period of Game 6, the Blues mounted a furious comeback to send the contest into overtime, where Doug Wickenheiser scored to force a deciding seventh game. Calgary would win Game 7 at home, 2–1, advancing into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time. The Flames proved to be no match for the Montreal Canadiens, losing the championship series in five games. Montreal rookie goaltender Patrick Roy was nearly unbeatable in the last two games, allowing only four goals en route to winning the Conn Smythe Trophy.|$|E

25|$|At {{the turn}} of the century the chances of the College gaining a royal charter seemed a distant prospect. Many on the College Council were aware of the need to {{progress}} and achieve greater financial support including Lewis Fry. They were aware that was it not for the anonymous donations made to the College (by a Mr Fenwick Richards) during the last century there would have been bankruptcy. The establishment of the University Colston Society (named after one of Bristol's great benefactors Edward Colston) was the impetus for the campaign to create a University for Bristol and the West of England. It was non-political and was aimed at <b>shaking</b> <b>off</b> the image that the College was a Liberal institution as it was recognised broad political support needed to be generated in order for the plan to become a University to succeed.

25|$|CMLL held a {{steel cage}} match {{involving}} 12 Mini-Estrellas, the rules dictated {{that the last}} two men in the cage would have immediately to face off in a Luchas de Apuestas ("Bet match") with the loser either having to unmask or have his hair shaved off as a result. The match took place on November 6, 2012 in Arena Coliseo in Guadalajara, Jalisco and included Aéreo, Astral, , Fantasy, Mercurio, Pequeño Black Warrior, Pequeño Halcón, Pequeño Olímpico, Pequeño Violencia, Pierrothito, Shockercito and Último Dragoncito. The wrestlers {{were not allowed to}} even attempt to leave the cage until three minutes into the ring, but once the deadline was up Pequeño Halcón was the first person out of the cage followed by Mercurio and Aéreo. Moments later, as Pequeño Olímpico was trying to climb over the top part of the wire mesh on the cage gave out and Pequeño Olímpico ended up with his arm trapped in the cage, needing help to get loose and to the floor where he was checked to see if he needed medical attention. After that Fantasy climbed over the cage the floor, escaping the match and joining Mercurio and Aéreo, who were still on the floor. Moments later Astral {{climbed to the top of}} the cage and dove off the 15-foot-high cage, landing a Moonsault on Mercurio, Aéreo and Fantasy who were still on the floor. During the move Astral got caught in the cage and landed in an uncontrolled manner on the floor, hitting his head, which promoted the medical personnel to immediately rush him out of the arena. The bad fall also hurt Mercurio, who had to be removed from the ring on a stretcher. Many of the remaining contestants, including Pierrothito bled during the match, some was possibly intentional as part of the plan for the match while others were not intentionally bleeding. Demus 3:16 was the recipient of several throws and falls off the cage as he tried to escape, finally <b>shaking</b> <b>off</b> his opponents to climb out. Once Demus 3:16 was on the floor he needed help to even stand and had to be helped from the arena. The last person to escape was Pequeño Violencia, who's back was bleeding from being thrown against the cage repeatedly. With Pequeño Violencia out it left Shockercity and Pequeño Black Warrior as the last two men in the ring, with both of them risking their hair on the outcome of this part of the match. Shockercito finally managed to defeat his opponent when he applied the La Reienera submission hold on Pequeño Black Warrior, forcing him to submit. Following the loss Pequeño Black Warrior had all his hair shaved off. Following the match Shockercito stated that he hoped his victory would earn him a match against one of the Mini-Estrella champions.|$|E

She further described the performance as integrated adding that, [...] "the coordination is not just remarkable, it's the absolute best way {{that two of the}} world's best performers can deliver a show that proves why they're on top together". MTV News editor Rebecca Thomas praised the duo's united performance, adding that they demonstrated how to share a stage, [...] "egos aside: They toggled, repeatedly, and mostly seamlessly from one megastar catalog to the other and took fan-favorites in surprising new directions — ones that imbued them with pathos that hadn't been there before." [...] Miami New Times Kat Bein felt that the chemistry between the couple was not what it could have been, with Beyoncé reportedly <b>shaking</b> <b>off</b> Jay-Z's kisses or turning away during his [...] "doting playfulness", however Bein added that this could have been merely a playful act for the stage. She felt that potential [...] "witty banter" [...] between the couple was lost {{with the use of the}} video pieces between the songs.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72 based on 19 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker perceived a maturity in the album's lyrical content and called its music [...] "as peppy as any Green Day have recorded". Charlotte Robinson of PopMatters commended Billie Joe Armstrong's lyrics and noted the band for embracing [...] "the pop bent {{that has always}} been a part of their sound". The A.V. Clubs Stephen Thompson stated [...] "Green Day has never made a record so slick and musically mature". Los Angeles Times writer Natalie Nichols wrote that the album [...] "reveal them <b>shaking</b> <b>off</b> the transitional aspects of 1997's Nimrod to craft a more coherent, less aggressive but still rebellious collection that also draws on the even older pop traditions of Bob Dylan, the Beatles and the Who".

Anyone open to its aesthetic will enjoy more than half its tracks".

500|$|The {{following}} day, Alice wrote a {{much shorter}} letter to Louis {{in which she}} looked forward to their meeting, and hoped that [...] "my letter did not distress you – but {{it is better to}} be quite honest about all one's feelings". Despite marital problems, Alice remained a strong supporter of her husband, being highly critical when his abilities or talents were not fully recognised. On 20 March 1877, Louis' father Prince Charles died, making Louis heir apparent. On 13 June the same year, Charles' older brother Grand Duke Louis III died, and Louis and Alice became the Grand Duke and Duchess of Hesse. Her continued unpopularity in Darmstadt, however, coupled with her mother not wanting her in England, caused strain, and she and her children spent July and August in Houlgate, Normandy, where Louis often visited them. She was hurt by her reputation in Darmstadt, and she became increasingly bitter towards it; Louis wrote in August 1877 expressing the hope that [...] "bitterness of the salt water will drive away the bitterness that you still feel against Darmstadt. Please my darling, don't speak so harshly of it when I come to join you – it would quite spoil my happiness at seeing you again." [...] Alice took Louis's letter to heart, responding: [...] "I shall certainly say nothing to you about Darmstadt when you come...I have no intention of saying anything unpleasant, least of all to you. You shake off anything unpleasant like a poodle <b>shaking</b> <b>off</b> the water {{when it comes to the}} sea – natures like yours are the happiest in themselves, but they are not made to help, comfort and advise others, nor to share with others the heat of life's noon-day or the cool of the evening, with insight, understanding and sympathy." [...] In response, Louis sent a letter that [...] "made [...] cry", and after this letter, Alice's letters to Louis were more encouraging, assuring him of his ability to make decisions by himself.|$|E

Rolling Stones Rob Hoerburger {{commented that the}} [...] "sharp-tongued" [...] Janet Jackson is [...] "more concerned with identity than with playlists", as Control declares {{she is no longer}} the Jacksons' baby sister. Hoerburger expressed the view that tracks such as [...] "Nasty" [...] and [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately" [...] erased the former [...] "pop-ingénue image" [...] of Jackson's first two albums, and that [...] "Control is a better album than Diana Ross has made in five years and puts Janet in a position similar to the young Donna Summer's—unwilling to accept novelty status and taking her own steps to rise above it." [...] Steven Ivory of Billboard expressed [...] "ocally, Jackson is more aggressive than ever. Indeed, her exhibition of sass and funkiness is certainly more provocative" [...] in comparison to her previous work. NME wrote: [...] "Jackson has gone a long way in <b>shaking</b> <b>off</b> the experience of being a shadow Jackson child. She is an artist in her own right." [...] Newsweek stated [...] "n an era of big-voiced pop-soul divas... her current hit album, is taut, funky, hard as nails, an alternative to the sentimental balladry and opulent arrangements of Patti LaBelle and Whitney Houston." [...] Robert Christgau [...] "scoffed at Janet's claims of autonomy", but gave the album a B rating based on [...] "its entertainment value". Los Angeles Times critic Connie Johnson wrote: [...] "Though still a teen-ager, this singer's stance is remarkably nervy and mature. She has a snotty sort of assurance that permeates several cuts, plus the musical muscle to back it up." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times notes Control takes obvious influence from Prince, describing [...] "he album's pacing, its clipped vocal lines—even the spoken introduction that starts things off" [...] as pure Minneapolis sound; he adds [...] "ut where the Prince style is usually connected with heavy-breathing come-ons, Miss Jackson is cheerfully standoffish." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{need of a}} {{statement}} game, the 49ers traveled to Seattle for a Thursday Night Football game against their division rivals. During the broadcast on NFL Network, Cris Collinsworth noted {{that if he were}} starting an NFL franchise, he would have taken the Broncos rookie quarterback Jay Cutler before Alex Smith and fellow rookies Matt Leinart and Vince Young – and that Smith was not even close to the others. Going into the 4th quarter, the 49ers were trailing the Seahawks 7–3, and pulling out a win looked unlikely. Smith however performed brilliantly in the fourth quarter, and drove the 49ers on a long touchdown drive down the field early, taking a narrow 10–7 lead. Late in the quarter, with the same score, Smith struck again – <b>shaking</b> <b>off</b> an almost certain sack, rolling to the left and completing a pass to Frank Gore for a touchdown to give the 49ers a 10-point lead. On the next drive, Smith cemented the victory by leading yet another touchdown drive, and rushing for a touchdown on a naked bootleg. Collinsworth had earlier in the game observed that [...] "Alex Smith is the best I've ever seen him. That drive is the best I saw," [...] and on seeing his touchdown run, commented [...] "What a second-half he has had!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{news of the}} {{revolution}} was greeted with dismay by the conservative leaders of Europe, committed to upholding the system established at the Congress of Vienna, but was greeted with enthusiasm by many ordinary people across Europe. After {{the execution of the}} Patriarch Grigorios, the Russian Emperor Alexander I broke off diplomatic relations with the Sublime Porte after his foreign minister Count Ioannis Kapodistrias sent an ultimatum demanding promises from the Ottomans to stop executing Orthodox priests, which the Porte did not see fit to answer. In the summer of 1821, various young men from all Europe began to gather in the French port of Marseilles to book a passage to Greece and join {{the revolution}}. The French philhellene Jean-François-Maxime Raybaud wrote when he heard of the revolution in March 1821 [...] "I learnt with a thrill that Greece was <b>shaking</b> <b>off</b> her chains" [...] and in July 1821 boarded a ship going to Greece. Between the summer of 1821 and end of 1822, when the French started to inspect ships leaving Marseilles for philhellenes, some 360 volunteers travelled to Greece. From the United States came the doctor Samuel Gridley Howe and the soldier George Jarvis to fight with the Greeks. The largest contingents came from the German states, France and the Italian states. In Nafplio, a monument to honor the philhellenes who died fighting in the war listed 274 names, of which 100 are from Germany, forty each from France and Italy, and the rest from Britain, Spain, Hungary, Sweden, Portugal and Denmark.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{generally}} agreed among historians that English, Anglo-Saxons, did migrate to Constantinople {{in these years}} and joined the Varangian Guard, something which can be shown beyond question from other sources. A more reliable source, closer to the events in question, is the Ecclesiastical History of Orderic Vitalis. Orderic, after {{an account of the}} Norman conquest of England and the failure of the northern rebellion, summarised the responses of the defeated English as follows:And so the English groaned aloud for their lost liberty and plotted ceaselessly to find some way of <b>shaking</b> <b>off</b> a yoke that was so intolerable and unaccustomed. Some sent to Sveinn, king of Denmark, and urged him to lay claim to the kingdom of England ... Others went into voluntary exile so that they might either find in banishment freedom from the power of the Normans or secure foreign help and come back and fight a war of vengeance. Some of them who were still in the flower of their youth travelled into remote lands and bravely offered their arms to Alexius, emperor of Constantinople, a man of great wisdom and nobility. Robert Guiscard, duke of Apulia, had taken up arms against him in support of Michael whom the Greeks — resenting the power of the Senate — had driven from the imperial throne. Consequently the English exiles were warmly welcomed by the Greeks and were sent into battle against the Norman forces, which were too powerful for the Greeks alone. The Emperor Alexius laid the foundations of a town called Civitot for the English, some distance from Byzantium; but later when the Norman threat became too great he brought them back to the imperial city and set them to guard his chief palace and royal treasures. This is the reason for the exodus of the English Saxons to Ionia; the emigrants and their heirs faithfully served the holy empire, and are still honoured among the Greeks by the Emperor, nobility, and people alike. Beyond this account, the details of the story of New England are impossible to verify; the sources in question are late, and many of the elements are, {{in the words of one}} historian, [...] "fantastic".|$|E
