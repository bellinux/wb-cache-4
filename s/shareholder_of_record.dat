If you sell stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date, your shares will be sold with a book entry sometimes called a [...] "due bill," [...] which denotes that (though the company will pay the dividend to your account, if you are the <b>shareholder</b> <b>of</b> <b>record</b> on the date three business days prior to the record date), your account must, in turn, turn the amount of that dividend over to the buyer of your stock. Conversely, if you buy stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date of a large special dividend, you are entitled to the dividend and will receive it via the due bill process.|$|E

50|$|A {{rights issue}} is {{directly}} distributed {{as a tax}} free dividend to all <b>shareholders</b> <b>of</b> <b>record</b> or through broker dealers <b>of</b> <b>record</b> and may be exercised in full or partially. Subscription rights may either be transferable, allowing the subscription-rightsholder to sell them {{on the open market}} or not at all. A rights issue to shareholders is generally made as a tax-free dividend on a ratio basis (e.g. a dividend of three subscription rights for two shares of common stock issued and outstanding). Because the company receives shareholders' money in exchange for shares, a rights issue is a source of capital in an organization.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} section 601 (a) (2) of the Jumpstart Our Small Business (JOBS) Act of 2012, which modified the threshold for unlisted banks and bank holding companies (BHCs) to deregister under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 from 300 to 1, 200 <b>shareholders</b> <b>of</b> <b>record.</b> This change in the cutoff permits utiliz-ing the quasi-experimental technique of regression discontinuity to identify the causal effect of Exchange Act deregistration {{on the performance of}} banks and BHCs that took advantage of the statutory change. Using an original dataset consisting of 187 commu-nity banks and a novel application of comparative interrupted time series analysis to regression discontinuity, I estimate the local average treatment effect of deregistration on compliers. Consistent with theory and qualitative evidence that the JOBS Act was beneficial for smaller banks, deregistration caused $ 1. 27 higher net income and $ 3. 38 lower pretax expenses per $ 1 of average assets, and $ 1. 24 million greater assets per employee. However, deregistered banks also had $ 2. 35 lower pretax income and $ 1. 95 lower equity capital per $ 1 of assets...|$|R
40|$|The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”), in part, amended § 12 (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Originally enacted {{to impose}} {{mandatory}} disclosure requirements on non-reporting companies {{with a significant}} volume of trading, § 12 (g) became dysfunctional due {{to changes in the}} market landscape. The JOBS Act amended § 12 (g), first, by raising the <b>shareholders</b> <b>of</b> <b>record</b> threshold, and second, by excluding from the threshold number persons who received securities pursuant to certain employee compensation plans. This note argues that the JOBS Act’s retooling of § 12 (g) fails to adequately resolve fundamental problems with the rule. Specifically, the amendments will promote a dysfunctional standard for the mandatory disclosure triggering requirements, which will enable public companies to manipulate the rule. Additionally, it will reduce the number of IPOs, which is not the best policy for spurring job growth and economic growth. These unintended consequences can be avoided by changing the § 12 (g) triggering requirements to a two-tiered approach that regulates the private and public spheres using different metrics. These metrics should reflect trading volumes and beneficial ownership of public and private companies, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The JOBS Act of 2012 {{reflects}} the largest deregulatory {{change to the}} Securities Exchange Act of 1934 over its more than 75 year history. It contracts the coverage of those companies subject to the obligations of ‘publicness” and it introduces an “on ramp” that will permit most newly-public companies to meet a lesser set of disclosure, internal control and governance obligations {{for up to five}} years. We set these changes against a larger discussion of when a private enterprise should be forced to take on public status in securities regulation, a topic that has been entirely under theorized. We conclude that the change from 500 to 2000 <b>shareholders</b> <b>of</b> <b>record</b> made by the JOBS Act, while entirely clear in its deregulatory thrust, misses a key point: “record” ownership is an antiquated metric for any measuring of publicness and Congress needs to find a better one, such as public trading. More broadly, we observe that Congress increasingly has defined public obligations in securities regulation less by the traditional touchstone of investor protection and more by ways that our largest companies affect constituencies beyond their investor base. Our boundary-setting thus should include two tiers of public companies with the smaller tier limited to core disclosure and governance obligations. Finally, our review of these boundary questions reveals a larger pattern that ought to inform how we understand securities regulation. Entrepreneurs and their advisors regularly occupy new unregulated space created in the wake of technological change or by gaps in regulation revealed as markets evolve. Government response, seemingly inevitably, is piecemeal and reactive. The result is a regulatory process that is more informal than administrative law theory usually suggests and more opaque than we might want in contemplating regulatory change...|$|R
