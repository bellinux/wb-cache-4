40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{application}} of a sequential extraction scheme provides information on the phase association of elements in a sample, such phases being described, for example, as ‘exchangeable/adsorbed’, ‘amorphous Fe/Al oxides ’ and ‘soluble organics’. It is therefore critical to maintain the chemistry of a sample {{from the time of}} collection to its analysis and during its preparation for analysis. This paper focuses on the redistribution of elements, amongst five operationally defined phases, that occurs on air-drying of the sample; the effect of subsequent <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> is not addressed. Two lake sediment cores (‘Green Lake’, 31 cm, and ‘Gravel Pit Lake’, 19 cm) were sampled at 1 -cm intervals and divided into two sets immediately prior to sequential leach analysis of the ‘wet ’ sample. The other set was air-dried prior to sequential leach analysis. Most of the 39 elements determined in the Green Lake sediment showed, on drying, a redistribution to more labile forms. For example, increases in Fe concentration in the oxide phases were observed with a concomitant decrease in the crystalline forms of Fe reporting to the final aqua regia digestion. These changes are generally small in magnitude (< 10 % of the total element extracted) but they can change the shape of the element profile down the core for an affected leach which in turn could lead to misinterpretation of the sequential leach data. Surprisingly, S did not show any changes on drying, suggesting that the kinetics of oxidation are reasonably slow and that <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> rather than drying is more important. The fact that some elements in the Gravel Pit Lake core behaved differently to Green Lake indicates that redistribution of elements on sample drying is both element and matrix dependent...|$|E

In a placebo-controlled, within-subject design, we combined event-related functional magnetic resonance imagingwith aDAmanipulation (acute phenylalanine/tyrosine depletion; APTD) in healthy volunteers to pinpoint the neuroanatomical and functional substratesof theDAmodulationof timing. Behaviorally,APTDselectively impairedaccuracyofperceptual timing,withno effect on performance of a color-control task matched for difficulty, working memory (WM), and attentional demands. Neurally, APTD attenuated timing-specific activity in the putamen and SMA.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{assessment}} of the vaginal lactobacillary flora helps to direct further diagnostic microbiologic investigations in genital infectious disease and seems to represent a powerful tool in predicting infectious morbidity and preterm labor during pregnancy. In {{the absence of a}} "gold standard," we studied the variations in assessing lactobacillary morphotypes according to the method used. METHODS: The lactobacillary flora from 183 pregnant women was classified according to 3 groups: normal, intermediate, and abnormal. This grading of lactobacilli was appled to vaginal and cervical specimens by means of 1) immediate wet-smear microscopy, 2) Gram's stain on a fresh, air-dried specimen, and 3) delayed Gram's stain after specimen transportation in Stuart's growth medium for 3 - 6 h. RESULTS: The assignment of intermediate or abnormal flora (grade II or grade III) showed high concordance rates among the different preparatory techniques, but the assignment of grade I (normal flora) did not. Fewer lactobacilli were found 2. 6 times more often after Gram's stains of fresh specimens [Relative Risk (RR) 2. 6, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 7 - 4. 1] and 6 times more often when the Gram%s stain was performed in a delayed examination after transport than in a fresh wet-mount specimen (RR 6. 2, 95 % CI 2. 5 - 15. 6). Disturbed lactobacillary grades were also found more frequently in specimens from the cervix than those from the vagina (RR 4. 0, 95 % CI, 1. 5 - 10. 4). CONCLUSIONS: There are discrepancies in the diagnosis of lactobacillary grades between gram-stained and fresh vaginal specimens. The evidence is ambiguous as to which of the 2 methods is responsible.

As a first step to apply the hydration phenomenon of inorganic compounds for this purpose, we investigated the hydration and dehydration process of CuSO 4 with H 2 O, D 2 O and HTO (93 μCi/cc) by using thermal desorption spectroscopy. Three desorption peaks appeared in the desorption spectra for CuSO 45 H 2 O and CuSO 45 D 2 O at 60, 80 and 180 ℃. It indicates that there are three distinct bound states of absorbed water molecules (denoted as Ⅰ, Ⅱ and Ⅲ). The ratio among the amounts of absorption in each of the states were 2 : 2 : 1. With respect to CuSO 45 HTO, the first and second peaks appeared at the same temperature as those for H 2 O, whereas the third peak was observed at 183 ℃, being 3 ℃ higher than that of H 2 O. Tritiated water was homogeneously distributed among the three states at first and redistributed during storage at room temperature in a closed container for several days. The concentration of the tritiated water in state Ⅰ decreased and that in state Ⅲ increased. The analysis of desorption spectra made it clear that the rate determining step for the dehydration was a random nucleation processes for each of the absorbed states. The actovation energies were 20, 23 and 35 kcal/mol for state Ⅰ, Ⅱ and Ⅲ, respectively. No isotope effect was observed in this term. The kinetic isotope effect only appeared in the frequency factor for the desorption of water in state Ⅲ: that is, the frequency factor for state Ⅰ and Ⅱ were 1. 1 x 1010 and 1. 1 x 1011 sec- 1, respectively: they were valid for the three kinds of water molecules.

40|$|Oxidation-reduction {{potential}} (ORP) measurement {{has demonstrated}} oxidative stress {{in patients with}} severe illness/injury. A new ORP diagnostic platform using disposable sensors (Supplemental Figure 1) has been validated by comparison to mass spectrometry, but the response of ORP to experimental positive and negative control conditions has not been determined. Furthermore, optimal methods of sample handling for ORP measurement have not been studied. We sought to optimize ORP measurement in human plasma, under controlled conditions. We hypothesized that freeze-thawing of the sample, <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> for up to one month, and the method of sample anticoagulation would influence ORP levels. Furthermore, we hypothesized that ORP can detect incremental experimental changes that either increase or decrease redox state. Finally, we hypothesized that trauma injuries cause increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the circulating bloodstream, and therefore would reflect higher ORP signals in plasma measurements in both human and mouse subjects. We enrolled healthy human volunteers in a prospective observational study and measured ORP in plasma prepared with heparin or citrate anticoagulants directly after blood draw and up to 28 days later. Additionally, we evaluated the platform’s ability to detect an exogenous increase and decrease in ORP by performing {{both positive and negative}} control titrations using six different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and two different concentrations of ascorbic acid respectively. Lastly, we compared human trauma plasma samples in an uncontrolled emergency room setting with healthy human plasma and then mimicked this experiment in a more controlled mouse model experiment. We found that fresh plasma better retains the ORP signal as compared to freeze-thaw samples measured on subsequent days. We also found that the platform can detect exogenous, concentration-dependent oxidations with H 2 O 2 and reductions with ascorbic acid. Furthermore, plasma prepared with heparin is more sensitive than using citrate anticoagulant when measuring ORP. Also, human trauma patients’ plasma (of varying degrees of trauma) samples were characterized by significantly higher ORP signals than healthy controls when measured in heparin anticoagulant, whereas mouse ORP signals did not change following a controlled, moderate traumatic brain injury. These data indicate that the diagnostic platform is capable of detecting exogenous increases and decreases in ORP signal from plasma samples with validity and is sensitive to different concentrations of positive and negative controls. We also show that plasma should be collected and centrifuged in heparin anticoagulant tubes and can be analyzed fresh or frozen for optimal results...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of an objectionable "swampy" odour in drinking water distribution systems in Perth, Western Australia, was first described by Wajon and co-authors in the mid- 1980 s (Wajon et al., 1985; Wajon et al., 1986; Wajon et al, 1988). These authors established that the odour, variously described as "swampy", "sewage" or "cooked vegetable" was caused by dimethyltrisulfide (DMTS) which has an odour threshold concentration of 10 nanograms per litre (ng/L). Investigations {{described in the present}} Thesis extend the work of Wajon and co-workers in attempting to establish the origin and cause of DMTS formation in Perth drinking water distribution systems. The DMTS problem appeared to be confined to water originating from a particular type of groundwater, specifically groundwater sourced from shallow, unconfined aquifers, which contain relatively high concentrations of sulfide, dissolved natural organic matter (NOM) and dissolved iron. DMTS was not present in the groundwater, but only formed in the distribution system, after treatment of groundwater via alum coagulation-filtration and oxidation processes. One objective of the present work was to determine the reasons for the observed association between DMTS formation and this specific groundwater type. A primary focus was to investigate the chemistry and biochemistry of sulfur species and NOM which might act as precursors to DMTS. The work was driven by the view that increased understanding of the problem might lead to more effective and acceptable treatment solutions than those presently in use. The observation that DMTS forms in distributed water that originates from groundwater, but not in water from surface sources has led to the hypothesis that groundwater NOM may contain precursor(s) to DMTS For example, it was proposed that methyl esters and ethers within humic substances might be a source of methyl groups that ++could participate in DMTS formation in distributed water (Wajon and Heitz, 1995; Wajon and Wilmot, 1992). Further, comparison of levels of reduced sulfur with levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in groundwaters feeding Wanneroo GWTP revealed that a positive correlation between these two parameters existed. This observation provided further impetus to examine the nature of NOM in these groundwater systems. In the present study (discussed in Chapter 3), NOM from two Perth drinking water sources was isolated and characterised, with the aim of identifying major differences in structure and/or functional groups that might influence DMTS formation. NOM was isolated from water samples using ultrafiltration, and characterised using pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) and offline- thermochemolysis/methylation (TCM). Pyrolysis of groundwater NOM yielded a high proportion of organosulfur compounds, primarily methyl thiophenes and sulfur gases, but did not yield detectable amounts of methoxy-aromatic compounds. Analysis by TCM yielded sulfur compounds tentatively identified as the methyl esters of methylthiopropanoate and methylthiobutanoate, compounds that may arise as degradation products of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), an algal odmoregulator Compounds such as DMPS could potentially undergo reactions to form DMTS in distributed water. The task of investigating the {{formation of}} nanogram-per-litre concentrations of DMTS demanded the development of new analytical procedures {{that could be used to}} determine similarly low concentrations of DMTS precursors. Evidence existed to suggest that inorganic polysulfides could be plausible precursor compounds, and since no technique existed to analyse and quantify individual polysulfide homologues a new technique needed to be developed and verified. The technique, first used in a semiquantitative manner by ++Wajon and Heitz (1995), utilizes methyl iodide to derivatise polysulfides in-situ. The technique was developed further and shown to be quantitative and specific for inorganic polysulfides. Further, a new procedure for the determination of d i methyl polysulfides (DMPSs; CH 3 SnCH 3, where n = 2 - 5), based on purge and trap was developed. In this new procedure analytes were trapped on a "Grob" activated charcoal tube, which was integrated into a commercially available, automated purge and trap instrument. Perdeuterated analogues of the DMPS analytes were synthesized and used as internal standards. These modifications resulted in a more rapid and robust procedure than the previously used procedures, vii which were based on closed loop stripping analysis (CLSA). Validation of the precision, accuracy, linearity and robustness of the new procedures for both inorganic polysulfides and dimethylpolysulfides is described in Chapter 4. Previous authors (Wajon and Heitz, 1995; Wajon and Wilmot, 1992; Wilmot and Wajon, 1997) hypothesized that DMTS could arise in the distribution system from residual polysulfides or other reduced sulfur compounds originating from groundwater. The latter authors showed that a small proportion of sulfide in the groundwater was not completely oxidised to sulfate during the water treatment process and proposed that this residual reduced sulfur fraction, which they referred to as non-sulfide reduced sulfur (NSRS) could contain precursors to DMTS. In a review of the chemistry of sulfide oxidation (Chapter 2) it was shown that the most likely forms of sulfur comprising the NSRS that enters the Wanneroo distribution system are organosulfur compounds and elemental sulfur, probably associated with organic matter in the form of a sulfur sol. Analysis of inorganic polysulfides in treated water, using the newly described method in Chapter 4, revealed that small ++amounts of these compounds (20 - 80 ng/L) were occasionally present in some samples. However, it was concluded that, since inorganic polysulfides could not survive water treatment processes, these compounds probably arose from traces of biofilm or pipe sediment that may have entered the water during sampling. It was proposed that the presence of biofilm particulates in water samples probably also accounted for observations that DMTS appeared to form in some water samples during <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample.</b> These studies are discussed in Chapter 5. The primary method of control of DMTS formation in the distribution system has been to maintain free chlorine residuals. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs have not been studied; the effectiveness of DMTS oxidation by chlorine, or how chlorine affects microbial processes that might form DMTS is not known. These issues are addressed in the final section of Chapter 5. Experiments to determine the effectiveness of oxidation of dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) and DIVITS (5 mu g/L) by free chlorine (0. 2 to 0. 6 mg/L) in distributed water showed that these substances are rapidly and completely oxidised in water containing a chlorine residual of more than 0. 4 mg/L. However, slow regeneration of traces of DMDS and DIVITS after dissipation of free chlorine to non-detectable levels showed that these compounds were incompletely oxidised at the lower chlorine concentrations~ This provides some rationale for field observations that DIVITS occurs even where low, but measurable, chlorine residuals appear to exist (< 0. 2 mg/L). As was established in a review of the chemistry of reduced sulfur compounds Chapter 2), reducing conditions not present in the oxic bulk water are required for DMTS to form and to persist. It was therefore proposed that microbial reduction processes could generate anoxic microniches in the distribution system, within which ++DMTS production could occur. This hypothesis was investigated in Chapter 6; the new methods for analysis of organic and inorganic polysulfides were applied to the study of biofilms and deposits of colloidal material found in distribution pipes and storage reservoirs. The study demonstrated that these materials contained concentrations of methylated and inorganic polysulfides four to six orders of magnitude higher than those ever found in the bulk water phase. The results indicated that reducing conditions most probably exist within the biofilms and pipewall deposits, where these polysulfides were formed. The iron-rich pipe slimes appeared to protect the sulfur compounds against the oxidative effects of chlorine and dissolved oxygen. It was concluded that the organic and inorganic polysulfides most probably arise through microbial sulfate reduction processes that occur in anoxic microenvironments within the slimes and deposits. Microbial processes that lead to the formation of polysulfides and dimethylpolysuifides under conditions approximately representative of those in distribution systems were investigated in work described in Chapter 7. The aim of this work was to investigate the role of biofilms in the formation of DMTS and to determine the nature of chemical precursors which might stimulate these processes. Biofilms, artificially generated on synthetic supports within chambers filled with water from Wanneroo GWTP, were exposed to compounds thought to be potential DMTS precursors. The response of the systems in terms of production of methylated sulfur compounds was monitored. Conclusions of the study were that, under the test conditions, production of DMDS and DMTS could occur via several mechanisms and that these dimethyloligosulfides could be formed even without the addition of compounds containing sulfur or methyl moieties. DMTS did not form in the absence of ++biofilms and it was therefore concluded that minimisation of biofilm activity was a key in preventing DMTS formation. Outcomes of the work imply that environments within distribution systems are complex and dynamic, as perhaps manifested by the intermittent nature of the DMTS problem. Finally, in Chapter 8 the conclusions to the present studies are summarised. It is shown how they underpin the rationale for proposed new treatment solutions aimed at preventing DMTS problems in the Wanneroo zone, primarily by minimising microbial activity and biofilm formation within distribution systems...|$|E
