5|$|A common path {{interferometer}} is a {{class of}} interferometer in which the reference beam and sample beam travel along the <b>same</b> <b>path.</b> Fig.4 illustrates the Sagnac interferometer, the fibre optic gyroscope, the point diffraction interferometer, and the lateral shearing interferometer. Other examples of common path interferometer include the Zernike phase contrast microscope, Fresnel's biprism, the zero-area Sagnac, and the scatterplate interferometer.|$|E

5|$|On April 27, 2014, {{three years}} and two days after this tornado, a violent EF4 tornado touched down west of Ferndale and moved along almost the <b>same</b> <b>path</b> as this tornado, causing 16 {{fatalities}} and many injuries. However, it affected more of Mayflower than this tornado did and caused greater damage all along the path, especially in Vilonia, before lifting near El Paso.|$|E

These two survivors consume the morning dew for sustenance, and from their descendants {{the world will be}} repopulated. Vafþrúðnismál stanza 45 is then quoted. The personified sun, Sól, will have a daughter at least as beautiful as she, and this daughter will follow the <b>same</b> <b>path</b> as her mother. Vafþrúðnismál stanza 47 is quoted, and so ends the foretelling of Ragnarök in Gylfaginning.|$|E
5|$|White Plume Mountain {{is set in}} the World of Greyhawk, a {{campaign}} setting for Dungeons & Dragons. The module is a dungeon crawl, precipitated by the theft of three magical, sentient weapons: a trident named Wave, a war hammer named Whelm, and a sword named Blackrazor (all three were introduced in this adventure). The weapons' former owners each received a copy of a taunting poem, instructing them that the weapons are located in White Plume Mountain. The poem is signed by the wizard Keraptis, who thirteen hundred years ago descended into the volcanic mountain with a company of gnomes and disappeared. The player characters goal is to follow the <b>same</b> <b>path</b> and retrieve the weapons from Keraptis' lair.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} ten, Zita {{was sent}} to a {{boarding}} school at Zanberg in Upper Bavaria, where there was a strict regime of study and religious instruction. She was summoned home in the autumn of 1907 at the death of her father. Her maternal grandmother sent Zita and her sister Franziska to a convent on the Isle of Wight to complete her education. Brought up as devout Catholics, the Parma children regularly undertook good works for the poor. In Schwarzau the family turned surplus cloth into clothes. Zita and Franziska personally distributed food, clothing, and medicines to the needy in Pianore. Three of Zita's sisters became nuns and, for a time, she considered following the <b>same</b> <b>path.</b> Zita went through a patch of poor health and was sent for the traditional cure at a European spa for two years.|$|E

30|$|Quality of Paths. The {{quality of}} paths used by MCMP and ECMP schemes {{indicates}} the path length (number of hops of paths used), path usage (frequency of reuse of the <b>same</b> <b>paths),</b> and path multiplicity (average number of paths {{used to send}} data to the base station). The value of these parameters provides an indication on the reliability and stability of the algorithms used.|$|R

Later, all trolleybus services were replaced with diesel powered buses.|$|R
5|$|August 15, 1787: The Four-State Tornado Swarm of 1787 was {{the largest}} tornado {{outbreak}} recorded to date, and affected most of New England. The first in the state touched down around 1:30PM near New Britain, traveling along nearly the <b>same</b> <b>path</b> as a tornado in 1728 or 1729. This tornado was nearly as violent as the Wallingford Tornado of 1878. A mother and two of her children were killed in Wethersfield, and 10 others were injured before the tornado lifted outside of the town. What may have been another tornado caused additional damage as far east as Coventry. Another tornado struck East Windsor, damaging several homes and barns. Yet another touched down near Killingly, moving northeast into Rhode Island and Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh {{was born}} in Tirhut, India, on 1 July 1879, one of six {{children}} (five sons and a daughter) of a Scottish indigo planter, Alexander Mackintosh, a descendant from the chieftains of Clan Chattan. Aeneas would in due course be named as an heir to the chieftainship, and to the ancient seat at Inverness that went with it. When Aeneas was still a young child, his mother, Annie Mackintosh, suddenly returned to Britain, bringing the children with her. The reasons for the family rift are unknown, but it was evidently permanent. At home in Bedfordshire, Aeneas attended Bedford Modern School. He then followed the <b>same</b> <b>path</b> as had Ernest Shackleton five years earlier, leaving school {{at the age of}} 16 to go to sea. After serving a tough Merchant Officer's apprenticeship, he joined the P and O Line, and remained with this company until he was recruited by Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition, which sailed for Antarctica in 1907. Before the expedition's departure Mackintosh was commissioned Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots along the <b>same</b> <b>path</b> as the race fleet and {{was starting to}} pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E

Finding warp zones might become a natural goal of a gaming session, being used as a checkpoint.|$|R

This new company was majority-owned by the Stanley Brewery Co Limited.|$|E
25|$|A knight's tour is a {{sequence}} of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once.

50|$|Animals {{usually make}} use {{of a network of}} paths to move from one {{locality}} to another.

Where one of several paths may have been used, trackers must of course determine which path that specific animal used. This may not always be easy, since many animals often use the <b>same</b> <b>paths.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{right-of-way}} {{that would}} become the Keystone Corridor was mainly laid by two railroads. The tracks east of Dillerville, just west of Lancaster, were originally the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, part of the state-owned Main Line of Public Works. From Lancaster west to Harrisburg, the tracks were laid by the Harrisburg, Portsmouth, Mount Joy and Lancaster Railroad. Except for minor realignments, today's Keystone Corridor runs along the <b>same</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E

25|$|On weekdays all {{stations}} are served {{at least every}} 10 minutes until the evening. There are six main lines and one peak hour support line.

5|$|Hippo {{defecation}} creates allochthonous {{deposits of}} organic matter along the river beds. These deposits have an unclear ecological function. A 2015 study suggests that hippo dung provides nutrients from terrestrial material for fish and aquatic invertebrates. Because of their size and their habit of taking the <b>same</b> <b>paths</b> to feed, hippos can {{have a significant impact}} on the land across which they walk, both by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground. Over prolonged periods, hippos can divert the paths of swamps and channels.|$|R
