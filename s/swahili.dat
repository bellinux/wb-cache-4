He also translated the Gospel of Luke into <b>Swahili.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Gedi ruins {{were first}} {{discovered}} by colonialists in 1884 after a British resident of Zanzibar, Sir John Kirk, visited the site. However, the ruins remained obscured until their subsequent rediscovery in the 1920s, when the site began to gain {{attention from the}} British East African government. Initial excavations at Gedi began in the late-1940s, and the site today {{remains one of the}} most intensely studied <b>Swahili</b> Coast settlements. The significance of the ruins has been largely used to assess the sites role within the region in association with other sites to provide insight into the development of <b>Swahili</b> culture, the organization of Indian Ocean trade, the introduction and spread of Islam, and the political and economic ties between <b>Swahili</b> communities through their cultural remains and their spatial relationships.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{stewardship}} of Gedi {{was turned over}} to the National Museums of Kenya. The site is currently administered by the museum's Department of Coastal Archaeology. In 2000, the construction of a museum funded by the European Union concluded, which features a permanent display on <b>Swahili</b> culture.|$|E

These include clicks (found in the Khoisan languages of Africa), implosives (found in languages such as Sindhi, Saraiki, <b>Swahili</b> and Vietnamese), and ejectives (found in many Amerindian and Caucasian languages).|$|E
5|$|Since the 1990s archaeological {{research}} at Gedi and other <b>Swahili</b> coastal settlements has intensified. From the 1980s archaeological research increasingly {{began to focus}} more on the relationships between the coastal communities and their internal development, challenging the original notion that the development of the <b>Swahili</b> Coast was driven by foreign influence through Indian Ocean trade or by Arab colonists. Another important development in the study of <b>Swahili</b> coastal sites is the increased attention given to remains of structures that were not built of stone. Surveys of the open terrain at Gedi found dense concentrations of mud-thatched dwellings. In 2001, Stephane Pradines from the Institute Francias d'Archeologie Orientale and archaeologists from the National Museum of Kenya conducted a topographical survey of Gedi, which mapped the distribution of neighborhoods in order to investigate the site's urban development. Concurrently, Lynn Koplin conducted surveys of the mud-thatch neighborhoods, focusing on the area between the inner and outer walls. From 2002 to 2003, {{research at}} Gedi continued to focus on urban development prior to the fifteenth century, with focus on a group of coral houses built by social elites in the site's urban core.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{occupation}} at Gedi has been extrapolated {{as a result}} of excavations and historical documents pertaining to its material culture, architecture, and the known history of trade linking the <b>Swahili</b> Coast with the regions adjoining the Indian Ocean. The settlement of Gedi occurred long after the emergence of the earliest settlements along the <b>Swahili</b> Coast with the intensification of trade in the sixth century. The earliest evidence for occupation at Gedi is a grave marker that has been radiocarbon dated to between 1041 to 1278, placing the original settlement of the site sometime in the eleventh or early twelfth century.|$|E

5|$|Africa {{is home to}} a {{large number}} of {{language}} families, the largest of which is the Niger-Congo language family, which includes such languages as <b>Swahili,</b> Shona, and Yoruba. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population. A similar number of people speak the Afroasiatic languages, which include the populous Semitic languages such as Arabic, Hebrew language, and the languages of the Sahara region, such as the Berber languages and Hausa.|$|E
5|$|Gedi {{is one of}} many medieval Swahili-Arab coastal {{settlements}} {{that stretch}} from Mogadishu, Somalia to the Zambezi River in Mozambique. There are 116 known <b>Swahili</b> sites stretching from southern Somalia to Vumba Kuu at the Kenya-Tanzania border. Since the rediscovery of the Gedi ruins by colonialists the 1920s, Gedi {{has been one of the}} most intensely excavated and studied of those sites, along with Shanga, Manda, Ungwana, Kilwa, and the Comoros.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Swahili</b> Utendi wa Tambuka, an epic poem {{composed}} in 1728 at Pate Island (off {{the shore of}} present-day Kenya) and depicting the wars between the Muslims and Byzantines from the former's point of view, {{is also known as}} Kyuo kya Hereá¸³ali ("The book of Heraclius"). In that work, Heraclius is portrayed as declining the Prophet's command to renounce his belief in Christianity; he is therefore defeated by the Muslim forces.|$|E
5|$|The country's {{principal}} {{language is}} Kinyarwanda, which is spoken by most Rwandans. The major European languages {{during the colonial}} era were German, and then French, which was introduced by Belgium and remained an official and widely spoken language after independence. The influx of former refugees from Uganda and elsewhere during the late 20th century has created a linguistic divide between the English-speaking population and the French-speaking remainder of the country. Kinyarwanda, English, and French are all official languages. Kinyarwanda {{is the language of}} government and English is the primary educational medium. <b>Swahili,</b> the lingua franca of the East African Community, is also spoken by some as a second language, particularly returned refugees from Kenya and Tanzania. In 2015, <b>Swahili</b> was introduced as a mandatory subject in secondary schools. Inhabitants of Rwanda's Nkombo Island speak Amashi, a language closely related to Kinyarwanda.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{excavations}} at Gedi during the 1950s, concurrent excavations also {{took place at}} similar sites along the <b>Swahili</b> Coast. Wilson's 1982 survey of the 116 sites along the coast found 34 isolated ruins, which he concluded likely contained possible settlements or isolated dwellings. Although smaller settlements were studied, larger sites received the most attention. Other than Gedi, the site most intensively excavated was Ungwana {{at the mouth of}} the Tana River, which was similar in size to Gedi. However, compared to sites similar in size, Gedi had one of the more densely populated urban centers.|$|E
5|$|Dark Magus is a live double album by American jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader Miles Davis. It was {{recorded}} on March 30, 1974, at Carnegie Hall in New York City, during the electric {{period in the}} musician's career. Davis' group {{at the time of}} the concert included bassist Michael Henderson, drummer Al Foster, percussionist James Mtume, saxophonist Dave Liebman, and guitarists Pete Cosey and Reggie Lucas. He also used the show to audition saxophonist Azar Lawrence and guitarist Dominique Gaumont. Dark Magus was produced by Teo Macero and featured four two-part recordings titled after <b>Swahili</b> names for the numbers one through four.|$|E
5|$|Gedi's {{location}} {{along the}} coast and association with similar sites along the <b>Swahili</b> Coast made it an important trade center. Although there are few historical documents specifically associating Gedi with Indian Ocean trade, the site {{is thought to have}} been one of the most important sites {{along the coast}}. Gedi's architecture and an abundance of imported material culture including pottery, beads, and coins provide evidence of the city's rising prosperity over the course of its occupation from as early as the eleventh century to its abandonment in the early seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Gedi's {{participation}} in maritime trade {{can be seen}} in the increasing frequency of imports found at Gedi over the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Conditions along the Atlantic coast prevented European nations from opening sea lanes until the early-sixteenth century, limiting maritime trade to states with easy access to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Many artifacts found at Gedi including much of the ceramics, all the beads, and the two Chinese coins resulted from either direct or indirect trade with the Near East, Arabia, China, India, and Indochina. <b>Swahili</b> coastal settlements exported gold, ivory, slaves, ebony, mangrove poles, copper, copal gum, frankincense, myrrh, and crystal rock.|$|E
5|$|<b>Swahili</b> coastal {{settlements}} frequently conducted {{trade with}} the interior, obtaining goods for overseas trade or local consumption. However, isolated and small settlements have been interpreted as hinterlands that developed around and supported the economies of the larger settlements. Small settlements or hamlets were established between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries within the vicinity of Gedi including sites {{at the end of}} Mida Creek, Kiburugeni, Watamu, Shaka, and Kilepwa. These smaller settlements are thought to represent agricultural communities that provided Gedi with most of its agricultural produce.|$|E
5|$|Frusciante has {{an active}} solo career, having {{released}} eleven solo albums and five EPs; his recordings include elements ranging from experimental rock and ambient music to new wave and electronica. In 2015, Frusciante released his debut acid house album under his alias, Trickfinger. He has also recorded with numerous other artists, including The Mars Volta, {{for whom he}} was a studio guitarist (and occasional live performer) from 2002 until 2008; Josh Klinghoffer and Joe Lally, with whom he released two albums as Ataxia; and various collaborations with both Klinghoffer and Omar RodrÃ­guez-LÃ³pez. He has also produced and/or recorded with Duran Duran, Wu-Tang Clan, The Mars Volta and Omar Rodriguez Lopez, <b>Swahili</b> Blonde, Black Knights, The Bicycle Thief, Glenn Hughes, Ziggy Marley, Johnny Cash, George Clinton, Johnny Marr and others.|$|E
5|$|Excavations at Gedi have {{uncovered}} numerous artifacts, {{but the most}} abundant and commonly discussed in literature are beads and ceramics, which {{have been used to}} identify trade and to obtain dates for the site's occupation. Many of the names given to the stone houses refer to the objects found within or in association with them including two Chinese coins, a porcelain bowl, scissors, a Venetian Bead, cowrie shells, an iron lamp, and an iron box. The material remains found at Gedi {{have been found to be}} similar to the remains at adjacent <b>Swahili</b> coastal settlements with the greatest degree of variation among the styles of pottery represented. Of eight sites examined by Kirkman, the sites of Gedi, Ungwana, and Kilepwa had nearly identical material remains prior to the fifteenth century, while the sites of Mnarani, the Pillar Tomb at Malindi, Takwa, Kinuni, and Kilindidni increasingly similar material culture over the course of the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries. In addition to local production, one of the major contributors to the presence of cultural materials found at the site is due to the importance of Indian Ocean trade, which assumed a growing role in East Africa at the beginning of the Islamic era in the seventh century.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Frusciante married Nicole Turley, drummer {{and lead}} vocalist of the {{experimental}} band <b>Swahili</b> Blonde. On May 8, 2015 {{it was announced that}} Turley had filed for divorce. On October 3, 2015, Turley announced that she was seeking $75,000 a month as part of their divorce settlement. According to court documents, Turley, who was already being paid $20,000 a month, needs a higher payment to maintain her quality of living. She claims her finances are down to only $30,000. Turley said that Frusciante was worth $14 million and she was entitled to more money saying that together the couple employed a team of personal assistants, and owned three homes and a private music studio. A week later Frusciante responded to Turley's demands saying that he refuses to pay her any more money and that she is also seeking $2,600 a month for gifts and expenses for her adult brother. He also said he was done footing the bill for her musical career saying âI donât know if you can call her recording efforts a hobby or a past-time â¦ but it seems improper to characterize Nicole as a professional musician.â On October 19, 2015, a judge ruled in favor of Turley saying Frusciante had to pay his former wife $53,000 a month. Frusciante was also forced to pay $71,000 for Turley's legal expenses.|$|E
5|$|Languages evolve and diversify over time, and {{the history}} of their {{evolution}} can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European family is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as English, Russian and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin, Bodo and the other Chinese languages, and Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include <b>Swahili,</b> and Zulu, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family that are spoken mostly in Southern India include Tamil and Telugu. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.|$|E
5|$|Pottery {{produced}} locally in East Africa {{was shaped}} by hand, unglazed, and assumed to be open fired, {{but it has been}} proposed that the absence of evidence for kilns {{may be the result of}} mistaking their remnants for metal furnaces. However, the absence of glazed and wheeled pottery illustrates that the inhabitants of the <b>Swahili</b> Coast did not adapt these technologies as a result of Indian Ocean trade, but were primarily the recipients of finished products in exchange for other local produce. Conversely, fifteen different potters' marks have been found at Gedi on pottery found on or near the surface of the site dating to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which has been used to suggest the site may have had a communal kiln at that time. The pots inscribed with the potters marks show the variation of different types and styles of ceramics over time, which were influenced by local production, as well as, the adaption of foreign design elements. Prior to the diversification of local styles and types, early ceramics at Gedi were more uniform and contained similarities with ceramics found at other coastal sites. Despite the increase of imported ceramics in the fifteenth century, local varieties continued to be present in later levels of the sites occupation.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{maritime}} trade {{along the coast}} of East Africa dates to the Classical Period. The Periplus Maris Erthraei, written by an Egyptian-Greek merchant circa AD 40â55, described trading ports along the Indian Ocean including Azania, a historic designation of the East African coast extending southward to present day Tanzania. Physical evidence for trade predates the earliest towns in the ninth century with the discovery of four Roman beads from the fourth century and pottery from the fifth century. Roman documents from the first through fifth centuries, as well as, Ptolemy's Geographia also provide historical accounts of trade with East Africa, followed by a dearth of historical documents until the tenth century. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the fifth century, Arab, Indian, and Chinese shipping grew in importance, which was eventually dominated by Persia after its conquest of southern Arabia and Egypt in AD 515 and AD 616. It has been proposed that trade between the <b>Swahili</b> Coast and Persia, as well as later Islamic merchants following the spread of Islam after AD 632, contributed to the settlement and development of the coastal sites.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} classifications of beads {{common to the}} <b>Swahili</b> coastal {{settlements}} {{that have been found}} at Gedi. In his examination of beads found at Gedi and the Limpopo Valley (Mapungubwe), Schofield placed beads into three categories: red, blue, green, and yellow cylinders made from cane glass; smaller black, red, green, yellow, and blue biconical and lenticular beads made from wound glass; and spheres of red, black, and yellow pressed glass. Kirkman similarly created eight classifications of beads. All but 25 of the 558 beads categorized as class 1â3 were made from opaque glass. During his excavations at Gedi, Kirkman recovered 631 beads in six stratigraphic layers. Monochrome yellow, green, and black wound and pressed glass beads formed in melon, biconical, globular, barrel, and cylindrical shapes were the most common styles represented in strata from the fourteenth century and sporadically appeared in later levels. Small drawn cane glass beads are also commonly represented in fourteenth and fifteenth century levels with the colors green, opaque red, yellow, and black occurring more frequently than blue, brown, and red. It is believed that Islamic traders brought the majority of glass beads to East Africa, which were traded across the continent, since there is no evidence for local production or trade south or west of Egypt and Nubia {{with the exception of a}} site in Igbo Olokun Grove at Ile-Ife in southern Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Whitaker's 2006 {{portrayal}} of Idi Amin in the film, The Last King of Scotland earned him positive reviews by critics {{as well as}} multiple awards and honors. To portray the dictator, Whitaker gained 50 pounds, learned to play the accordion, and immersed himself in research. He read books about Amin, watched news and documentary footage featuring Amin, and spent time in Uganda meeting with Amin's friends, relatives, generals, and victims; he also learned <b>Swahili</b> and mastered Amin's East African accent. His performance earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor, making him the fourth African-American actor in history to do so, joining the ranks of Sidney Poitier, Denzel Washington, and Jamie Foxx. For that same role, he was also recognized with the British Academy Film Award, Golden Globe Award, National Board of Review Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and accolades from the Broadcast Film Critics Association, London Film Criticsâ Circle Award, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, National Society of Film Critics, and New York Film Critics Circle among others.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{starts in}} 1476 as Francisco leads Portuguese troops under Prince Juan {{to victory in}} the Battle of Toro by destroying Aragonese military camps and capturing Cardinal Mendoza and the Duke of Alba. He then launches raids on supporters of Queen Isabella. In the end, the battle is indecisive, but King Afonso receives assurances from Spain that the African coast and eastern waters are a Portuguese domain. Thirteen years later, in 1489, Francisco serves the now-King Juan, in a mission to consolidate Portuguese control of Tangiers at an island outpost in the Loukkos River led by Afonso de Albuquerque, defending the area from Barbary pirates. He is then appointed Viceroy of Portuguese India by King Manuel, and sets sail for his new post. He plunders the <b>Swahili</b> coast along the way there, razing Mombasa. He then establishes Portuguese India in Cannanore and Cochin and confronts the Zamorin of Calicut who intends to undermine Portuguese rule of India, and who has suborned the allegiance of Kolathiri Raja with gold; Francisco then plunders the Malabar coast. He then moves to the Gujarati coast. Afonso de Albuquerque is sent by King Manuel to relieve Francisco of his post and send him to Portugal to face accusations of misconduct in the Indies. Francisco hears of the news of his son's death {{at the hands of}} a Egyptian fleet led by Amir Husain and refuses to return until he avenges his son's death. He converts Afonso de Albuquerque to his side and then takes revenge on his enemies in the Battle of Diu in 1509, including the Egyptian Mamelukes and the Ottomans. This being done, he sets sail for Portugal, being slain by Khoikoi warriors in modern-day South Africa while gathering water.|$|E

25|$|Following the Bantu Migration, on {{the coastal}} section of Southeast Africa, a mixed Bantu {{community}} developed through contact with Muslim Arab and Persian traders, {{leading to the}} development of the mixed Arab, Persian and African <b>Swahili</b> City States.
