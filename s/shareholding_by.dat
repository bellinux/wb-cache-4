40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the connection between}} <b>shareholdings</b> <b>by</b> different groups of corporate officers (insiders and outsiders) and market valuation in South Africa. Specifically, we {{examine the effect of}} <b>shareholdings</b> <b>by</b> employees, chief executive officers (CEOs), chief financial officers (CFOs), other executive directors, and non-executive (outside) directors on market valuation. We find that total ownership by all corporate officers (insiders and outsiders) is positively related to market valuation. However, when we examine the link between ownership by individual groups of corporate officers and market valuation, our results suggest that firms with higher ownership by CEOs and other executive directors have lower market valuation, but we do not find any evidence that ownership by CFOs has any significant effect on market valuation. In contrast, we find that ownership by employees and non-executive outside) directors is positively related to market valuation. Our findings are generally consistent with the predictions of agency theory...|$|R
