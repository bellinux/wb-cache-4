500|$|Other {{critics were}} more positive. The New Statesmans Robert Potts found the stories [...] "entertaining and {{intriguing}} for readers familiar with their background {{and with the}} genre", {{and for the most}} part charmingly innocent, [...] "especially when compared with the reality of boarding-school life". [...] The evocation of adolescent homoeroticism was deliberate and playful rather than pornographic. In a similar vein, Richard Canning in The Independent found the Willow Gables fiction vibrant, well-constructed and entertaining, and praised Larkin's [...] "sly Sapphic spin". In a more recent analysis Terry Castle, writing in the journal Daedalus, disagrees profoundly with the notion expressed by Adam Kirsch in The Times Literary Supplement, that the publication of the Coleman works was damaging to Larkin's reputation. On the contrary, argues Castle, [...] "the Brunette phase <b>speaks</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> the paradoxical process by which Philip Larkin became 'Larkinesque'—modern English poetry's reigning bard of erotic frustration and depressive (if verse-enabling) self-deprecation".|$|E
500|$|Asked {{how does}} he think that the album has aged, Dave Mustaine responded: [...] "I think it's timely and {{timeless}} at the same time, and I think that's {{one of the most}} difficult things for a musician to do. Very few records in our genre are like that. Musically it's heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic." [...] In the liner notes of the album's 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that [...] "thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, Countdown to Extinction became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play." [...] Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a [...] "seminal" [...] release and commented that it [...] "changed the game by preserving the band's thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping some of the biggest hooks the genre had ever seen". In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that Countdown to Extinctions [...] "status as a gateway metal album is indisputable" [...] and its [...] "popularity <b>speaks</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> its significance in the metal canon".|$|E

He further said that [...] "this win of his party in third consecutive elections <b>speaks</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> the trust Turkish people repose in his leadership and the government's policies."

2500|$|Rats {{have long}} been {{considered}} deadly pests. Once considered a modern myth, the rat flood in India has now been verified. Indeed, every fifty years, armies of bamboo rats descend upon rural areas and devour everything in their path. Rats {{have long been}} held up as the chief villain in {{the spread of the}} Bubonic Plague, however recent studies show that they alone could not account for the rapid spread of the disease through Europe in the Middle Ages. Still, the Center for Disease Control does list nearly a dozen diseases [...] directly linked to rats. Most urban areas battle rat infestations. Rats in New York City are famous for their size and prevalence. The urban legend that the rat population in Manhattan equals that of its human population (a myth definitively refuted by Robert Sullivan in his book [...] "Rats") <b>speaks</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> New Yorkers' awareness of the presence, and on occasion boldness and cleverness, of the rodents. [...] New York has specific regulations for getting rid of rats—multi-family residences and commercial businesses must use a specially trained and licensed exterminator. Rats have the ability to swim up sewer pipes into toilets. [...] Rat infestations occur around pipes, behind walls and near garbage cans.|$|E

[...] He stated the win would put Techeetah's personnel in a positive state of mind {{and that they would}} return for the following the season as a stronger force in the series.

[...] Prior to the Flood of '77 the area was an extension of the Main Street/Downtown Business District. [...] C. S. Kunkle Lumber, Sesti's Restaurant, the Colonial Hotel, and the original location of Luther Ford Sales at one point all stood where the park is now found. [...] (A residential neighborhood was located behind the businesses, too. [...] On {{the opposite side of the}} creek the Empire - later Homer City - Theater dating to 1913 was another prominent structure.)
