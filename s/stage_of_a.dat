5|$|Because of {{domestic}} opposition, internal demoralization, and international hostility, Gaddafi assumed a more conciliatory attitude following his defeat. On the other side, Habré also found himself vulnerable, as the French {{feared that the}} attack on Maatan as-Sarrah was only the first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility that France was not disposed to tolerate. As a result, Mitterrand forced Habré to accept the mediation efforts of the Organization of African Unity's Zambian Chairman, Kenneth Kaunda, {{which resulted in a}} ceasefire on September 11.|$|E

40|$|Many animals produce {{multiple}} displays during agonistic interactions, but {{the roles}} of these displays often remain ambiguous. The hierarchical signaling hypothesis has been proposed to explain their occurrence and posits that different displays convey different levels of aggressive intent, allowing signalers to communicate graded series of threats. This hypothesis suggests that low-risk signals, typically performed at the beginning <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interaction, are strong predictors of high-risk signals but weak predictors of physical aggression. High-risk signals, typically produced at later <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interaction, are strong predictors of physical aggression. We used giant Australian cuttlefish, Sepia apama, to test these predictions. We combined field observations and laboratory video playback experiments to determine whether (i) male cuttlefish produce specific sequences of displays, (ii) displays in early <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interaction predict displays in later <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interaction, and (iii) displays produced in later <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interaction provide reliable predictors of physical aggression. Field observations suggested that males progressed from low-risk to high-risk signals (i. e., visual signaling to physical aggression). Video playback results zrevealed that the low-risk frontal display, produced during early <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interaction, conveys reliable information about the cuttlefish’s intent to escalate to later <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> visual signaling. Both the shovel and lateral displays were produced during the later <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> signaling and were reliable predictors of subsequent physical aggression. Our study supports the hierarchical signaling hypothesis and provides new empirical insights into how cuttlefish use progressive visual signaling to convey increasing levels of threat. 13 page(s...|$|R
5|$|Since {{dance is}} already an art form, “weapon dance as art” may seem redundant; yet, “art” is used here {{to mean the}} re-creation, say, of a folk weapon dance in a more {{professional}} staged venue, such as a ballet, or when an Australian, Native American, or African troupe of professional musicians and dancers present a reenactment on <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> weapon dance, or when the use of weapons is introduced in stylized dance enactments of fighting. For example, recent ballets such as the New York City Ballet’s version of Romeo and Juliet (to the music of Sergei Prokofiev) employ highly choreographed sword-fight/dance sequences.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} studies {{investigated}} sending a Gemini spacecraft onto a circumlunar trajectory. Many of the proposals made for this involved a double-launch architecture, with the Gemini spacecraft rendezvousing with an upper stage in orbit. Upper stages that were considered included the Transtage, the second <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Titan II, four different types of Centaur, including the S-V variant developed for the Saturn I, the Agena-D, an enlarged Agena, and two Agenas burning in parallel. Either a Titan or Saturn IB would {{have been used to}} launch the upper stage, whilst the Gemini would launch on the Titan II, as it had in the Gemini program.|$|E
5|$|After the Australian Open, {{he participated}} in the 2011 SAP Open in San Jose, where he was {{accepted}} into the main draw via protected ranking (PR). He reached the semifinals without dropping a set, however he lost to top seed Fernando Verdasco in straight sets. Del Potro's next scheduled tournament was the 2011 Regions Morgan Keegan Championships and the Cellular South Cup, where he was accepted into the main draw via wildcard. Here, he made his second consecutive ATP semifinal, where he lost to top seed, world No. 8, and eventual champion Andy Roddick. To continue preparing for his first ATP Masters event since 2009, del Potro entered the 2011 Delray Beach International Tennis Championships. He defeated Ričardas Berankis, Teymuraz Gabashvili, Kevin Anderson and second seed Mardy Fish, to advance to an ATP-level final <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tournament since 2009 at the Barclays World Tour Finals in London.

5|$|In late 2002, after {{airlines}} expressed {{reservations about}} {{its emphasis on}} speed over cost reduction, Boeing halted development of the Sonic Cruiser. The following year, the manufacturer announced the 7E7, a mid-size 767 successor made from composite materials which promised to be 20percent more fuel efficient. The new jetliner was the first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project. Customers embraced the 7E7, later renamed 787 Dreamliner, and within two years it had become the fastest-selling airliner in the company's history. In 2005, Boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record Dreamliner sales, citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option. Subsequently, the 767-300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays, including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. Some aging 767s, exceeding 20 years in age, were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays. To extend the operational lives of older aircraft, airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures, including D-check teardowns and inspections for corrosion, a recurring issue on aging 767s. The first 787s entered service with All Nippon Airways in October 2011, 42 months behind schedule.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mature}} <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thunderstorm, the warmed air {{continues}} to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this 'cap' is the tropopause. The air is instead forced to spread out, giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape. The resulting cloud is called cumulonimbus incus. The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become rain. If the updraft is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large {{that they do not}} melt completely but fall as hail. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating downdrafts as well. The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds. During this stage, considerable internal turbulence can occur within, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even tornadoes.|$|E

In his next game against FC Arsenal Tula on 17 August 2014, he again assisted on both goals in Dynamo's 2-1 victory. On 28 August 2014, Dynamo defeated AC Omonia in the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League play-off round, through a decisive goal by Christopher Samba in the 93rd minute of the return leg following a free kick performed by Valbuena, and qualified {{for the first time}} for the group <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> European competition (since the group stage was introduced). On 31 August 2014, he scored his first goal for Dynamo in a 2-0 victory over FC Krasnodar. On 16 September 2014, he had to undergo an emergency appendectomy. He returned to playing on 2 October 2014 in a Europa League group game against PSV Eindhoven, in which Yuri Zhirkov scored a winning goal deep into injury time after a corner delivered by Valbuena.|$|E
