Several Unitarians in Abington, a suburb of Philadelphia, objected and held a protest against it. One of them, Ellery Schempp, contacted the American Civil Liberties Union about the issue. The ACLU and Schempp's parents believed the school prayer law violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The ACLU's lawyers saw Sawyer as the best choice to argue it, given his skill as a litigator and his success in the Deutch case. Sawyer agreed and filed suit in federal district court.|$|E

The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate selected characteristics including task behavior and integrative complexity of the principal, student mobility and school size and their relatonship to the <b>reading</b> achievement of <b>students</b> in selected Title I elementary schools. The study included principals in 34 Title I elementary schools in Rockford School Dirstrict 205, Rockford, Illinois, in 1981. Reading achievement scores were obtained for third and sixth grade students in these schools for the 1979 - 1980 and 1980 - 1981 school years. Three instruments were used to collect the data for this research. These instruments were a Principal Background Information Sheet, Gaynor's School Principal Task Inventory and the Zajonc Instrument of Integrative Complexity Cognitive Structure Test. The statistical analysis used to test the hypothesis was the Stepwise Multiple Regression. An alpha level of. 05 was used for inclusion in the resulting equation. All computations were done by computer utilizing the SPSS package. Analysis of the data resulted in the following fndings. Characteristics of leadership related positively to higher <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> achievement in all 11 dependent variables examined. Low student mobility related positively to high <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> achievement in nine of the dependent variables. Differentiation related positively to higher <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> achievement in three variables. Higher age of the principal related positively to higher <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> achievement in two variables. Integrative complexity related positively to higher <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> achievement in one variable. Task maintenance, gender, and experience in the principalship, and school enrollment were not significant in any of the multiple relationships. Conclusions based on the findings were that there is a high positive relationship between the leadership characteristics and behaviors of the principal and <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> achievement. There was also a high positive relationship between student mobility and <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> achievement.

He also gave him the address of a Chinese student a year Hergé's junior, Zhang Chongren. The pair first met on 1 May 1934, soon becoming close friends and spending every Sunday afternoon with each other for over a year. Zhang later commented that he and Hergé became akin to [...] "two brothers". A student of painting and sculpture at Brussels' Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Zhang taught Hergé about Chinese artistic styles, giving him a set of traditional Chinese brushes and explaining to him the art of painting a tree and Chinese calligraphy, alongside explaining the tenets of Taoist philosophy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} instructional reading strategies,professional development and training, and reading assessments used to improve <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> skills in secondary high schools. The study focused on urban high schools in Northeast Indiana with diverse populations. Classroom teachers at the secondary level described their experiences in teaching reading. These "lived through" classroom experiences were examined to gain a better understanding of how instructional reading strategies, professional development and training, and reading assessments could be used at the secondary level to improve <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> skills. This study expanded on the works ofBarry (1997), High School Reading Program Revisited; Barry (2002), Reading Strategies Teachers Say They Use; Said, Sisson, Worley, & Zipperer (2002), Literacy Education and Reading Programs in the Secondary Schools: Status, Problems, and Solutions; and Schneider and Spor (1999), Content Reading Strategies: What Teachers Know, Use, and Want to Learn. This research examined the responses and the information pertaining to 13 interview questions through teacher interviews, classroom observations, and a review of the curriculum. These sources presented emerging themes and patterns. The results of this investigation revealed that perhaps the biggest obstacle to improving <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> skills in the focus schools was the attitude of classroom teachers. Presently, secondary teachers do not accept the teaching of reading skills as ttheir responsibility. Once administrators convince secondary classroom teachers to accept their responsibility for teaching reading, administrators have a challenge of providing appropriate professional development and training in instructional reading strategies and reading assessments. The current study focused on an investigation of instructional reading strategies,professional development and training, and reading assessments used at the secondary level to improve <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> skills. Due to the complexity of the reading process, a more in-depth research study needs to be conducted on each of the components of this research study. Evidence of failure, clearly points out that learning to read the English language is not as easy as some may lead one to believe. Therefore, the following recommendations are suggested on topics of instructional reading strategies, professional development and training, and reading assessment used at the secondary level to improve <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> skills: (a) instructional reading strategies used at the secondary level to improve <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> skills, (b) professional development and training used at the secondary level to improve <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> skills, (c) reading assessment used at the secondary level to improve <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> skills, (d) and focus on the principal's role at the secondary level to improve <b>student</b> <b>reading</b> skills.
