500|$|When {{asked about}} the rumour that the band's name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: [...] "It's not a rumour, it's based on a story that <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> It's not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. I would say that it's {{probably}} something that the kid made up, {{but at the time}} I believed him." ...|$|E
500|$|Some people {{mentioned}} that the album's title, Memory Almost Full, is an anagram of [...] "for my soulmate LLM" [...] (the initials of Linda Louise McCartney). When asked if this was intentional, McCartney replied; [...] "Some things are best left a mystery". In an interview with Pitchfork Media, McCartney clarified, [...] "I must say, <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> , and I think it's a complete mystery, because it's so complete. There {{does appear to be}} an anagram in the title. And it's a mystery. It was not intentional." [...] The album's title was actually inspired by a message that came up on his mobile phone. He thought the phrase summed up modern life.|$|E
500|$|In the AIA Guide to Chicago, the Ponds are {{identified}} {{as part of the}} [...] "circle of young architects", including Frank Lloyd Wright, that was responsible for [...] "transforming the concepts of the Arts & Crafts movement into the indigenous Prairie [...] School." [...] Pond was a contemporary, and in some ways rival, of Wright in the Chicago architectural scene of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. [...] Both were members of the Chicago Architectural Club and served as judges and participants in the Club's annual competitions. [...] One biographer of Wright noted that Wright was insulted when the American Institute of Architects in 1912 commissioned a study of midwestern [...] "progressive architecture" [...] and instructed the investigators to examine the work of Louis Sullivan and Pond, but not including Wright. [...] In a letter to Lewis Mumford, Wright expressed his dislike for the [...] "truly-old" [...] Pond:"Yesterday <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that truly-old I.K. Pond took exception to your 'Sticks and Stones' because you weren't a 'practicing architect.' [...] What 'practicing architects' know anything at all of architecture anyway, -- even if they could write about it? [...] Certainly not he. [...] He's a dried herring, hanging beneath the eaves or Architecture." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{unrest in}} the German Navy {{in the summer}} of 1917 also found its {{reflection}} in Stumpf's diary. He described the events in detail and then noted: [...] "If, in the past, <b>someone</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that it would be possible for people to be sentenced to jail or executed in Germany without having committed a crime, I would have looked upon him as a fool." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "In a gully {{above the}} village, I {{saw the first}} body.

But I said, [...] "No, I've pretty much got this story." [...] They looked like older men, with gray hair or white hair ... They had wounds on their heads, and there was blood on their clothes. [...] I didn't count them. I just looked and saw a lot of holes in the head - in the top of the head and the back of the head. A couple had what appeared to be bullet wounds knocking out their eyes. I was told there were other bodies further up and over the crest of the hill, and I was asked by journalists and inspectors if I was going to go up and see the rest. I said, 'I've seen enough.'" ...|$|E

This, thought I, would be the place for me to show my treasure. Doubtless Messrs. May and Primrose--that was their world-famed style--would be able to put me in touch with opulent orchidists who would not mind venturing a couple of thousands on the chance of receiving a share in a flower that, according to Brother John, should be worth untold gold. At any rate, I would try.|$|E

I don’t focus that much on what Isis does. Also this may sound strange, but this is genuinely the first time <b>someone’s</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> they (ISIS) threatened to attack the UK, which is probably a bit embarrassing, seeing as I’m in Syria and you’d expect I’d hear these things. If Britain stopped bombing Muslims in Syria the Muslims in Syria would stop attacking them. Is that hard to understand?" [...] When questioned about the treatment of Muslims in Syria he said: [...] "The Muslims in Syria are burned alive, raped, abused, imprisoned and much more. I also think that some of the Muslims I met here are living like walking mountains. Full of honour." [...] When asked about the US-led coalition and Isis he said: [...] "I’ve seen Muslims burned alive {{as a result of what}} the US calls 'hellfire missiles'. I’ve seen the little girls that lived around the corner from me at my old house hide from American jets and plugging their ears from the sound. Isis has (made) huge mistakes, I don’t deny that, but the coalition has (made) far worse mistakes. As a separate point, despite the media frenzy surrounding them, I’ve never seen Isis kill Muslim kids. I have, however, seen the coalition do so." ...|$|R

50|$|A new and {{vigorous}} Classics teacher offered {{to teach a}} few of us Greek, and that too was somehow slotted into our timetables. We loved this and worked madly at it, which meant that with considerable efforts on all sides, it was just possible for us to go to college on Classics … I had decided to read Classics rather than English - which was the first choice that occurred to me - because my English teacher, bless her, pointed out that English literature is something that you read in any case, so it is better to study something that you otherwise wouldn't. <b>Someone</b> also <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that, if you did Classics at Oxford, you could do Philosophy as well.

" "I understand what liquid is," said the man as he wiped his brow, "but what's white?" Glancing at a pond in the distance, the physicist replied, "White is the color of swan feathers. " "I've felt feathers, but what's a swan?" the friend asked again. "A swan is a bird with a crooked neck. " "I know what a neck is," said the friend, stroking his Adam's apple thoughtfully, "but what is crooked?" Exasperated, Einstein grabbed his friend's arm and bent it at the elbow. "That," he said, "is crooked. " "Ahhh," said the blind man. "Now I know what milk is. ...|$|R
