50|$|Aspergillus candidus is {{exclusively}} an asexually reproducing species. It {{is closely}} related to the darkly pigmented group of aspergilli that includes A. niger, and is in the clade of aspergilli that includes the sexually-reproducing genus, Sterigmatocystis. A. candidus forms typical branching, septate hyphae, which produce conidial heads at maturity. Conidiogenesis is favoured in reduced oxygen atmospheres. Optimal growth of A. candidus occurs at 25-28&deg;C at 0.016 atm partial pressure of oxygen. Growth of this species has been reported at temperatures as low as 11-13&deg;C and as high as 41-42&deg;C. A. candidus is xerophilic, meaning it can grow in low water availability. When grown on stored grains in 15% moisture content, it has the ability to increase the moisture level (up to 18%) and elevate the temperature to as high as 55&deg;C In the laboratory, ' was observed on media containing substances like p-hydroxy-benzoic aldehyde, lignin <b>sulphonate,</b> and tannin (which contains substances that A. candidus uses and degrades).Aspergillus candidus exhibits a broad range of microscopic and colony morphology. Typically, the colonies of A. candidus are white and conidial heads are globose (spherical) or subglobose (subspherical) producing globose, smooth, thin-walled, conidia. En masse, the conidia are typically white to cream-coloured, but some strains may show a pinkish to reddish purple colour when they absorb the pigment from the sclerotia. By contrast, the closely related species A. niger has darkly pigmented conidia with a rough surface. Some strains of A. candidus make sclerotia in culture, which are nodules consisting of densely aggregated hyphae. Sclerotial production is often induced by incubation under stressful conditions such as relatively low temperature or interference competition from co-culture with other microorganisms. Conidial heads are typically 2.5-4.0 µm in diameter, with phialides either directly attached to the apical swelling of the conidiophore (uniseriate) or situated upon a palisade of basal cells (biseriate) - the latter being the most common presentation. Macroscopically, young A. candidus colonies may have a cottony texture in the outer surface which eventually becomes granular as the fungus matures and produces conidia.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sulphonated</b> anthraquinones are {{precursors}} of many synthetic dyes and pigments, recalcitrant to biodegradation {{and thus}} not eliminated by classical wastewater treatments. In {{the development of}} a phytotreatment to remove <b>sulphonated</b> aromatic compounds from dye and textile industrial effluents, {{it has been shown that}} rhubarb (Rheum rabarbarum) and common sorrel (Rumex acetosa) are the most efficient plants. Both species, producing natural anthraquinones, not only accumulate, but also transform these xenobiotic chemicals. Even if the precise biochemical mechanisms involved in the detoxification of <b>sulphonated</b> anthraquinones are not yet understood, they probably have cross talks with secondary metabolism, redox processes and plant energy metabolism. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible roles of cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases and peroxidases in the detoxification of several <b>sulphonated</b> anthraquinones. Both plant species were cultivated in a greenhouse under hydroponic conditions, with or without <b>sulphonated</b> anthraquinones. Plants were harvested at different times and either microsomal or cytosolic fractions were prepared. The monooxygenase activity of cytochromes P 450 toward several <b>sulphonated</b> anthraquinones was tested using a new method based on the fluorimetric detection of oxygen consumed during cytochromes P 450 -catalysed reactions. The activity of cytosolic peroxidases was measured by spectrophotometry, using guaiacol as a substrate. A significant activity of cytochromes P 450 was detected in rhubarb leaves, while no (rhizome) or low (petioles and roots) activity was found in other parts of the plants. An induction of this enzyme was observed at the beginning of the exposition to <b>sulphonated</b> anthraquinones. The results also indicated that cytochromes P 450 were able to accept as substrate the five <b>sulphonated</b> anthraquinones, with a higher activity toward AQ- 2, 6 -SS (0. 706 nkat/mg protein) and AQ- 2 -S (0. 720 nkat/mg protein). An activity of the cytochromes P 450 was also found in the leaves of common sorrel (1. 212 nkat/mg protein (AQ- 2, 6 -SS)), but no induction of the activity occurred after the exposition to the pollutant. The activity of peroxidases increased when rhubarb was cultivated in the presence of the five <b>sulphonated</b> anthraquinones (0. 857 nkat/mg protein). Peroxidase activity was also detected in the leaves of the common sorrel (0. 055 nkat/mg protein), but in this plant, no significant difference was found between plants cultivated with and without <b>sulphonated</b> anthraquinones. Results indicated that the activity of cytochromes P 450 and peroxidases increased in rhubarb in the presence of <b>sulphonated</b> anthraquinones and were involved in their detoxification mechanisms. These results suggest the existence in rhubarb and common sorrel of specific mechanisms involved in the metabolism of <b>sulphonated</b> anthraquinones.

40|$|The blue swallow (Hirundo atrocaerulea) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{threatened}} bird species in southern Africa. Among terrestrial birds, its plumage is known to be the most water repellent, an adaptation to foraging on the wing in dense fog. Despite this unique adaptation, the nesting success of the blue swallow at the Blue Swallow Natural Heritage Site (BSNHS) is lower during years with high incidence of fog. As the phenomenon is not observed at other nesting sites, we hypothesized that this is due to changes in the air chemistry at the BSNHS. In the immediate proximity of the BSNHS, plantations of exotic trees (e. g., pines and eucalypts), rich in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are dominant features. In addition, air pollution from the Johannesburg area is transported with the surface winds and mix with VOCs released from exotic trees. Together with the high humidity and high elevation, these conditions may result in the formation of <b>sulphonates.</b> <b>Sulphonates</b> are strong detergents, and the presence of these in the fog could lead to decreased water repellence of the plumage. This study was performed in order to determine the occurrence and distribution of <b>sulphonates</b> in the BSNHS and to compare these with <b>sulphonates</b> formed in other locations in South Africa. Because the blue swallow is endangered, pine needles were used as proxy to detect formation of <b>sulphonates.</b> Methods: We sampled pine needles with different exposure to air pollutants, in climates with different humidity, and at different elevation and analyzed these for <b>sulphonates</b> using mass spectrometry. Results: Pine needles from high elevations and the BSNHS, with high humidity, and exposure to air pollution contained significantly higher concentrations of <b>sulphonates</b> than pine needles from low elevations or from high elevations with a dryer climate or a different combination of air pollutants. Conclusions: These findings lead to two conclusions. First, the occurrence and distribution of <b>sulphonates</b> may be explained by chemical reactions between sulphur dioxide and organic compounds in the humid air induced by ultraviolet radiation. Second, elevated concentrations of <b>sulphonates</b> in the fog could affect the water repellence of the blue swallow plumage, possibly decreasing their capacity to forage in the fog.

Plant height at maturity increases by the treatment of 0. 3 % MMS in Desi and 0. 1 %MES in Kasuri methi. Number of pods per plant observed under the treatment of 0. 3 % EMS and 0. 3 % MMS in Desi methi and Kasuri methi, respectively. The mutants obtained from the treatments 0. 3 % MMS for height, 0. 3 % EMS for number of pods per plant in Desi methi and treatments 0. 1 % MES for height, 0. 3 % MMS for number of pods per plant in Kasuri methi give more yield as compared to control plants...|$|E

Repair {{deficient}} mutants of Bacteroides fragilis {{have been}} isolated {{in order to}} study the responses of this organism to various DNA damaging agents at the physiological and molecular levels. Two types of mutants were isolated by ethyl methane <b>sulphonate</b> mutagenesis of B. fragilis followed by selection for sensitivity to mitomycin C. One mutant (UVS 9) showed sensitivity to both mitomycin C and far-UV irradiation. The other (MTC 25) was more sensitive to mitomycin C than UVS 9, but showed wild-type resistance to UV radiation. Both mutant strains had wild-type resistance to methyl methane <b>sulphonate...</b>|$|E
40|$|One- and {{two-dimensional}} separation {{methods have}} been developed for the analysis of lignosulphonates and <b>sulphonated</b> kraft lignins. The evaluated <b>sulphonated</b> lignins are all used as dispersants in agrochemical formulations, where some give rise to physical instabilities of formulations. It is of interest to identify the properties of the <b>sulphonated</b> lignins that determine the formulation characteristics. Tetrapentylammonium bromide has been used as an ion-pair reagent in a gradient-elution reversed-phase liquid-chromatographic (IP-RPLC) method, as well as in aqueous size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Clear differences in the size distribution were observed between different batches of <b>sulphonated</b> lignins. The RPLC and SEC methods were combined in a comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography system. The retention times in the two dimensions were highly correlated. Therefore, the full potential of comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography was not yet realized. However, the results did reveal that retention in IP-RPLC was not determined by the degree of sulphonation of similar-size molecules. Rather, molecules were separated according to size and the degree of sulphonation appears to be approximately constant. The information obtained in this study represents a significant step towards meaningful correlations between the requirements of surfactants within an agrochemical formulation and structural parameters, such as the size and the degree of sulphonation of lignin oligomers...|$|R
