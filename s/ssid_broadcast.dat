50|$|A common {{measure to}} deter {{unauthorized}} users involves hiding the access point's name by disabling the <b>SSID</b> <b>broadcast.</b> While effective against the casual user, it is ineffective {{as a security}} method because the SSID is broadcast in the clear {{in response to a}} client SSID query. Another method is to only allow computers with known MAC addresses to join the network,but determined eavesdroppers may be able to join the network by spoofing an authorized address.|$|E
5000|$|Disabling <b>SSID</b> <b>broadcasts.</b> Although, it only hides {{networks}} superficially. MAC {{addresses of}} routers are still broadcast, {{and can be}} detected using special means.|$|R
5000|$|Although network {{cloaking}} may add a small {{sense of}} security, {{it is common}} for people not to realize just {{how easy it is to}} discover hidden networks. Because of the various ways an <b>SSID</b> is <b>broadcast,</b> network cloaking is not considered a security measure. Using encryption, preferably WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) or WPA2, is more secure. Even WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), while weak and vulnerable, provides more security than hiding the SSID. There are many programs that are able to scan for wireless networks, including hidden ones, and display their information such as IP addresses, SSIDs, and encryption types. These programs are capable of [...] "sniffing" [...] out any wireless networks in range by essentially eavesdropping and analyzing network traffic and packets to gather information about those specific networks. The reason these programs can sniff out the hidden networks is because when the SSID is transmitted in the various frames, it is displayed in cleartext (unencrypted format), and therefore able to be read by anyone who has found it. An eavesdropper can passively sniff the wireless traffic on that network undetected (with software like Kismet), and wait for someone to connect, revealing the SSID. Alternatively, there are faster (albeit detectable) methods where a cracker spoofs a [...] "disassociate frame" [...] as if it came from the wireless bridge, and sends it to one of the clients connected; the client immediately re-connects, revealing the SSID. Some examples of these sniffing programs include the following: ...|$|R
