50|$|Great detail {{has gone}} into the stem and sheer design {{to ensure that the}} yachts have {{extremely}} strong edges to minimize “down time” during events due to collisions. The deck layout has a large self-draining cockpit, with cabin top mounted aluminum <b>self-tailing</b> secondary winches and deck-mounted primary winches.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Modern <b>self-tailing</b> winch on a sailing boat. Here, {{the line}} winched is a jib or {{spinnaker}} sheet which {{runs from the}} sail (upper left, not shown) to a block (lower right,not shown) {{and from there to}} {{the lower part of the}} winch. The handle is detachable to facilitate handling of the line.|$|E

The ASA 22 {{is the product of}} Beneteau design and engineering combined with ASA’s deep knowledge of efficient and safe teaching. It has an extended cockpit for group learning sessions and is equipped with roller furling, <b>self-tailing</b> winches and twin rudders.|$|E
50|$|Winch-a geared {{mechanical}} device used on yachts for trimming (adjusting)sail sheets, for hoisting large sails with halyards, for hauling in an anchor or {{on a boat}} trailer for hauling a boat out of the water. The normal turret winch is set on the aft side deck for trimming headsails and or a spinnaker. Manual trimming winches are operated by grinding the handle in a circle initially, then pulling back and forwards on a short lever while a second person tails (pulls to keep tension on the sheet)to obtain optimum force. Some winches are <b>self-tailing</b> or the sheet can be cleated to prevent slippage. On larger yachts winches can be operated by electric motors. Typically on America's cup yachts large pedestal winches are used which can be operated by two people at the same time. Because of the force needed, especially in tacking duels, winch grinders are usually very large and strong men.|$|E
