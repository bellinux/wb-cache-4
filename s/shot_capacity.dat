5000|$|These handguns {{share many}} common traits but are easily {{distinguished}} by key differences. Both models {{are based on}} the Smith & Wesson L-Frame and are available in 4" [...] barrels with 7 <b>shot</b> <b>capacity.</b> The 686 features a full-underlug barrel made of one piece whereas the 620 sports a half-lug and two piece barrel. The 620 weighs in at 37.9oz, just a hair lighter than the 686's 38oz. The lighter model also shaves 1/8" [...] off of the 686's 9" [...] overall length.|$|E
5000|$|This is a {{semi-automatic}} pistol made by Isidro Gaztañaga. The pistol {{bears the}} name [...] "I.G". {{and is in}} [...]25 ACP (6.35mm) - Center Fire. The magazine holds six <b>shots.</b> Other <b>capacities</b> were made available for the military. The pistol was issued to Spanish fifth columnists in the 1930s due to its small size (and hence {{was able to be}} concealed easily).The [...]25ACP round was not very powerful and was of use only at very close range. The barrel length is 2 in and the overall length of the gun is slightly over 4.25 in.|$|R

50|$|In {{the years}} prior to production, the Modelo 1905 pistol was tested {{multiple}} times in Europe alongside various other handguns.In late 1898, a board of army officers held a test in Bern, Switzerland between multiple pistols. These pistols included the six <b>shot</b> <b>capacity</b> and 10 <b>shot</b> <b>capacity</b> Mausers, the Bergmann, the Borchardt-Luger, the Roth, and the Mannlicher. The pistols were put through several tests, including assembly, explanation, firing 50 rounds, target shooting, timing while firing, and an endurance test in which the pistol must fire 400 rounds without being cleaned or allowed to cool. The Borchardt-Luger was the only pistol to pass the endurance test. Next, the pistols performed firing 20 rounds after dust and water tests, and the Borchardt-Luger was again, {{the only one to}} pass it without any malfunctions. A second test was held a year later, with the pistols being modified to the board's specifications. The Luger was modified to be much lighter and accurate for these tests that followed. As a result, the Luger became an instant success and the Swiss were the first to adopt it, and its popularity soared from there.The fact that the Modelo 1905 was not comparatively effective in testing against other pistols at the time is likely what led to its declined use in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The RPG-28 {{shares a}} close {{resemblance}} with the RPG-27 {{in that it}} is a portable, disposable anti-tank rocket launcher with a single <b>shot</b> <b>capacity.</b> The RPG-28 has a larger diameter round than the RPG-27 which enables the RPG-28 to achieve higher armour penetration performance. The PG-28 round is a 125 mm tandem shaped charge with a weight of 12 kg and a range of 300 meters. The round has a stated penetration capability in excess of 1000 mm RHA (after ERA) and 3000 mm of brick. Loaded weight is 13.5 kg.|$|E
50|$|The RPG-30, {{like the}} RPG-27, is a man-portable, {{disposable}} {{anti-tank rocket launcher}} with a single <b>shot</b> <b>capacity.</b> Unlike the RPG-27 however, there is a smaller diameter precursor round in a side tube, {{in addition to the}} main round in the main tube. The precursor round is fired shortly before the main round and acts as a decoy, tricking the target's active protection system (APS) into engaging it. The APS is not ready to engage again until 0.2-0.4 seconds later, allowing the main round time to hit the target.|$|E
40|$|This {{work will}} {{report on the}} {{characterisation}} of a new active pixel sensor, Vanilla. The Vanilla comprises of 512 × 512 (25 μm 2) pixels. The sensor has a 12  bit digital output for full-frame mode, although {{it can also be}} readout in analogue mode, whereby it can also be read in a fully programmable region-of-interest (ROI) mode. In full frame, the sensor can operate at a readout rate of more than 100  frames per second (fps), while in ROI mode, the speed depends on the size, shape and number of ROIs. For example, an ROI of 6 × 6 pixels can be read at 20, 000  fps in analogue mode. Using photon transfer curve (PTC) measurements allowed for the calculation of the read noise, <b>shot</b> noise, full-well <b>capacity</b> and camera gain constant of the sensor. Spectral response measurements detailed the quantum efficiency (QE) of the detector through the UV and visible region. Analysis of the ROI readout mode was also performed. Such measurements suggest that the Vanilla APS (active pixel sensor) will be suitable {{for a wide range of}} applications including particle physics and medical imaging...|$|R
5000|$|Other {{improvements}} {{over the}} previous design include a built-in, pop-up flash, FAT32 support for larger-capacity CompactFlash storage cards, a higher continuous shooting speed of 3 frames per second, an upgraded auto focus system with 5 sensors, an AF assist lamp, an improved viewfinder with a 0.9 &times; magnification, an almost silent and more durable shutter rated at 100,000 actuations, a larger 2.5" [...] LCD monitor, a USB 2.0 interface (but no firewire interface anymore), and a proprietary rechargeable (Minolta NP-400 compatible) lithium ion battery system with a claimed 500 <b>shot</b> <b>capacity</b> (user experience puts it closer to 150-200).|$|E
50|$|Paintball pistols are {{not used}} in tournament level {{speedball}} games. Due to one marker per person rules, a player may not carry two markers onto the field. A pistol has a lower <b>shot</b> <b>capacity,</b> leaving the player at a severe disadvantage against an opponent. Sometimes in recreational settings a player will agree {{to play with a}} pistol to put themselves at a severe disadvantage to attempt to prove superior skill over an opponent. Playing in such a situation has many similarities to stock paintball.Despite these apparent disadvantages there are a growing number of players who choose to play with a pistol as their primary marker.|$|E
5000|$|Powered by a 12g {{disposable}} CO2 cartridge or re-fillable internal air system, {{it features}} a blowback design and 9 <b>shot</b> <b>capacity</b> magazine using [...]43 caliber paintballs or rubberballs. The trigger is double-action (DA/SA). First versions {{did not have a}} conventional on/off safety. Current versions now have a manual trigger-lock safety. The marker is cocked by working the slide and there is also a functional de-cocker. It differs from the RAP4/5 system as it does not use (and therefore) eject shell casings. Muzzle velocity is adjustable between 200 ft/s and 300 ft/s. For [...]43 cal paintball - 0.029 oz it is about 3.4371 J (at 300 ft/s).|$|E
50|$|The RPG-27 {{shares a}} close {{resemblance}} {{with the previous}} RPG-26 {{in that it is}} a man-portable, disposable anti-tank rocket launcher with a single <b>shot</b> <b>capacity.</b> The RPG-27 has a larger diameter round than the RPG-26 which enables the RPG-27 to achieve higher armour penetration performance. The RPG-27 fin stabilised round is a 105 mm tandem-charge HEAT warhead with a range of 200 meters. The round has a stated penetration capability in excess of 600 mm of RHA (after ERA) and 1500 mm of brick or concrete and 3700 mm of earth. The RShG-1 is very similar in operation to the RPG-27 but carries a thermobaric warhead with a lethal radius of 10 meters and a larger range of 600 meters. Officially adopted by the Russian Government in December 2011.|$|E
50|$|The RPG-30 was {{designed}} to address the threat of active protection systems on tanks by using a false target to trick the APS. The RPG-30 shares a close resemblance with the RPG-27 {{in that it is}} a man-portable, disposable anti-tank rocket launcher with a single <b>shot</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, unlike the RPG-27, there is a smaller diameter precursor round in a smaller side barrel tube in addition to the main round in the main tube. This precursor round acts as a false target, tricking the target's active protection system into engaging it, allowing the main round a clear path into the target, while the APS is stuck in the 0.2-0.4 second delay it needs to start its next engagement. Recent German systems were able to reduce reaction delay to mere milliseconds, cancelling this advantage.|$|E
5000|$|Limited {{ammunition}} {{capacity is}} one of the primary downsides of the combat shotgun. While box magazines are available in some models (such as shotgun derivatives of the AK-47 design, like the Saiga-12), the tubular magazine is still dominant. This limits capacities; the current US pump shotgun issued, the Mossberg 590, has a 5 or 8 <b>shot</b> <b>capacity</b> depending on barrel length. The tubular magazine does allow easy [...] "topping off" [...] (a tube-fed pump shotgun can be kept shouldered and aimed at a target and ready to fire while being loaded), so training emphasizes the need to load the magazine to full capacity whenever the opportunity presents itself. A common doctrine is [...] "shoot one, load one": load a shell immediately after every shot (when this does not jeopardize the operator's safety), to ensure that the shotgun is fully loaded at all times; this ensures that the operator has a full magazine at his/her disposal in case of emergencies when he/she {{may not be able to}} reload in between shots. [...] A pistol is also advised as a backup weapon, should the operator empty the magazine and not have time to reload. A sling to carry the shotgun is essential if it is to be used in conjunction with another weapon, so that the shotgun may be readily accessible.|$|E

The focus of the plan is on: (1) developing diagnostic instruments with high spatial and temporal resolution, capable of low noise operation and survival in the severe EMP, bremsstrahlung, and blast environments of ZR; and (2) providing diagnostic infrastructure improvements, including reduced diagnostic trigger signal jitter, more and flexible diagnostic line-of-sight access, and the capability for efficient exchange of diagnostics with other laboratories. This diagnostic plan is the first step in an extended process to provide enhanced diagnostic capabilities for ZR to meet the diverse programmatic needs of a broad range of defense, energy, and general science programs of an international user community into the next decade...|$|E
40|$|Quantum {{information}} theory predicts {{that when the}} transmission resource is doubled in quantum channels, {{the amount of information}} transmitted can increase more than twice, while the increase is at most twice in classical {{information theory}}. For maximum use of the quantum-limited communications channels, such superadditive increase of the channel capacity must be included in a strategy to design a communications system. Here we present a proof-of-principle experiment of this remarkable feature, the superadditive quantum coding gain, by implemententing quantum collective decoding for the length two code of the ternary symmetric states in terms of polarization and location modes of a single photon. We develop optical circuits for the polarization-location coding, and study three kinds of quantum measurement, i. e. the generalized measurement for the accessible information, the von Neumann measurement for the single <b>shot</b> <b>capacity,</b> and the square root measurement for the length two coding. We further discuss practical implication of the gain on communication performance, introducing the quantum-classical hybrid coding scheme. In particular, we show how the superadditive quantum coding gain, even in a small code length, can boost the communication performance of conventional coding technique...|$|E
