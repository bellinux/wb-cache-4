Four different estimates of genetic distance between all possible pairs of communes within each province were also obtained, and their relationship with geographic distance was studied. The logarithmic transformation of Lasker's coefficient of relationship showed correlations with the log of geographic distance which range between - 0. 78 and - 0. 40; the strongest, for the province of Catania, was attributed {{to the presence of}} Mount Etna, and the weakest, for Palermo, to the high population density of this province...|$|R
