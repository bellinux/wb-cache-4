50|$|Unlike {{previous}} treaties, {{which included}} both First Nations and European tradition, the numbered treaties {{were conducted in}} a purely British diplomatic manner. First Nations were given translators, either of European or Métis descent, who were to translate {{what was being said}} during the discussions. What can be seen here is {{a significant difference between the}} written documents used by government officials of the time, and the oral traditions used by the First Nation communities throughout the negotiation process. This reality is proven through diaries like those of the Indian commissioner, Duncan Campbell Scott, who wrote a detailed account of negotiating Treaty 9 through Treaty 11. There are also claims from First Nations people that Alexander Morris failed to mention the <b>surrender</b> <b>clause</b> in the treaty text at the negotiations for Treaty 6, leading to miscommunication between the two groups. Evidence can also be found amongst the few written documents of the time by First Nations chiefs; during Treaty 3, Chief Powasson took detailed notes during the negotiations, which shows the differences in understanding of what was being offered during the talks because of the language barrier.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} Hungary’s antimoney laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism measures. The Hungarian authorities have made significant progress in strengthening their AML regime. The most important step has been {{the passage of a}} revised AML Act of 2003, replacing the 2001 revision of the original 1994 AML Act. With this, the legislative framework for AML is in place, and has been extended to nonfinancial businesses and professions. Financial institutions’ compliance with the AML requirements is well supervised, and they are well aware of their obligations under the Act.

5000|$|Catt {{was elected}} to the Assembly for the {{district}} of Stanley, 27 April 1881. Three years later, when the constituency was reconstructed, he was returned for Gladstone. Catt accepted the post of Commissioner of Crown Lands in John Bray's first administration, on 24 June 1881, and held it till 23 April 1884, under circumstances of special difficulty. Disasters had fallen thickly upon the farmers of the colony, especially in the northern districts lying beyond Goyder's Line of rainfall, where thirsty and often heavily timbered country had been taken up at extravagant prices by the competing agriculturists, who in some cases had offered as much as £6 6s. per acre. The attempt to grow wheat in these parts proved that the selectors could not pay the stipulated price, and the Government of the day came to the rescue with a proposal that the farmers should be allowed to surrender their land and compete for it again. The result was that they got their land back at about £1 0s. 6d., thus entailing upon the State a nominal loss of about half a million. The <b>surrender</b> <b>clauses</b> were admittedly difficult to administer, and Mr. Catt was much blamed at the time for allowing farmers holding excellent land in the lower north and south-east to come under these clauses. Catt, however, claimed that these were exceptional cases. On the fall of the John Downer Ministry in 1887, Catt accepted the portfolio of Commissioner of Public Works under Thomas Playford II, and held it from 11 June 1887, to 27 June 1889. At the commencement of the session of 1890 Catt was unanimously elected to the Chairmanship of Committees of the Legislative Assembly. In 1887 he received the royal permission to bear the title of [...] "Honourable" [...] within the colony.|$|R
5000|$|The Cairo Declaration {{was issued}} on 27 November 1943 and {{released}} in a Cairo Communiqué through radio on 1 December 1943, stating the Allies' intentions to continue deploying military force until Japan's unconditional <b>surrender.</b> The main <b>clauses</b> of the Cairo Declaration {{are that the}} three great allies are fighting this war to restrain and punish the aggression of Japan, they covet no gain for themselves and won't involve themselves in territorial expansion wars after the conflict, [...] "Japan be stripped of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied {{since the beginning of}} the First World War in 1914", [...] "all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, including Manchuria, Formosa, and the Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China", Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed and that [...] "in due course Korea shall become free and independent".|$|R
500|$|The McKeevers {{held their}} 25% {{interest}} in the Dodgers until 1975 when Dearie McKeever died. They sold out to O'Malley making him the sole owner of the Dodgers. [...] Also during 1975, the Dodgers franchise was embroiled in the Andy Messersmith controversy {{that led to the}} Seitz decision, which struck down baseball's reserve clause and opened up the sport to modern free agency. Messersmith and the Dodgers were unable to come to contract terms in part because of a then unheard of no-trade clause demand, and Messersmith pitched the entire season without a contract under the reserve clause, which stated that team has the right to extend the prior years contract one year if a player does not agree to terms. Teams had previously had the right to continue such re-signings year after year. This gave owners the right to issue [...] "take it or leave it" [...] offers to the players. Although the Dodgers and Messersmith nearly hammered out a deal monetarily, they could not come to terms on the no-trade clause. Supposedly Major League Baseball instructed the Dodgers not to <b>surrender</b> such a <b>clause</b> {{for the good of the}} game. The Seitz decision limited the re-signings to one year, and since Messersmith performed quite well in 1975, winning a Gold Glove Award and leading the National League in complete games and shutouts, while finishing second in earned run average, he was a valuable talent. He earned offers from six different teams. Messersmith became the first free agent, except for Catfish Hunter who had been declared a 1974 free agent by breach of contract. O'Malley felt the price wars would be the downfall of baseball because the fans only have so much money. The scenario led to an eighteen-day lockout during spring training in [...] over the prospect of dozens of players playing becoming free agents and the inability to redesign the reserve clause.|$|R
