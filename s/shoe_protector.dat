Removing the hot <b>shoe</b> <b>protector</b> will re-enable the built-in flash. A micro-switch in the hot-shoe senses the presence of the flash.|$|E
40|$|Common {{understanding}} of Ergonomics is {{a branch of}} the systematic use of information on the properties, capabilities and limitations of humans to design a working system, so that humans can live and work on it with a good system, which is to achieve the desired goal through the job effectively, safe, and comfortable. The focus of ergonomics is human interaction with products, equipment, facilities, procedures and environment and workers as well as everyday life in which the emphasis is on human factors. Here will be discussed on the concept design and product development innovation skateboard <b>shoe</b> <b>protector</b> which refers to the concept of ergonomics. The things that have to be prepared prior to skateboarding, such as using special shoes skateboard. Usually the recommended shoe is a little thicker {{in order to protect the}} feet. Preoccupations of skateboarding shoes sometimes lead to damage or tear due to friction with the court, so that the skaters often change his shoes and skater often indirect cost to buy a new skateboard shoes. Given these problems, then do the research design of protective skateboard shoes. Specification of the final product design innovation skateboard shoe protectors 38 - 40, namely the long dimension of 26 cm- 32 cm estrangement between, 10 cm wide, leather products, and as the front and rear bumpers are made from raw rubeber products. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe porous {{polymers}} {{are applied}} to sports equipment like a <b>shoe</b> sole, shock <b>protector</b> and grip tape of racquets. To analyze the mechanical properties of porous polymers under large deformation, the formulation of the homogenization analysis of hyperelasticy and mechanical loading test results of porous polymers for sports equipment were described in this paper. The computational simulation program of the hyperelasticity based on the homogenization method was newly developed. In order to evaluate the pore ratio on the mechanical characteristics of porous polymers, unit cell computation of microscopic structure were performed. In the mechanical loading tests, fundamental properties of porous polymers for sports equipment were shown to investigate the effect of microscopic pores diameter and material stiffness on the macroscopic mechanical characteristics. By the comparing the numerical simulation with experimental results, applicability of the proposed method to the porous polymer was shown...|$|R
