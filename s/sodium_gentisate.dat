40|$|In man {{and other}} animals, urinary {{excretion}} of the histidine and histamine metabolite, imidazoleacetate, is increased {{and that of}} its conjugated metabolite, ribosylimidazoleacetate, decreased by salicylates. Imidazoleacetate {{has been reported to}} produce analgesia and narcosis. Its accumulation as a result of transferase inhibition could play a part in the therapeutic effects of salicylates. To determine the locus of salicylate action, we have investigated the effect of anti-inflammatory drugs on imidazoleacetate phosphoribosyl transferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent conjugation of imidazoleacetate with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate. As little as 0. 2 mM aspirin produced 50 % inhibition of the rat liver transferase. In vivo, a 30 % decrease in the urinary excretion of ribosylimidazoleacetate has been observed with plasma salicylate concentrations of 0. 4 mM. The enzyme was also inhibited by sodium salicylate but not by salicylamide, <b>sodium</b> <b>gentisate,</b> aminopyrine, phenacetin, phenylbutazone, or indomethacin. The last four drugs have been shown previously not to alter the excretion of ribosylimidazoleacetate when administered in vivo. Since both the drug specificity and inhibitory concentrations are similar in vivo and in vitro, it seems probable that the effect of salicylates on imidazoleacetate conjugation results from inhibition of imidazoleacetate phosphoribosyl transferase...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} compounds known {{to suppress the}} manifestations of rheumatic fever are reviewed and the antirheumatic nature of certain phenolic compounds discussed. We report on 75 patients with acute rheumatic fever who have been treated with gentisate compounds and discuss the records of 44 of these patients who have been followed for 3 to 20 months after discontinuing drug therapy. These patients were treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>gentisate,</b> "Gen, " methyl cellulose-sodium gentisate and gentisic acid ethanolamide. The urinary excretion records of these drugs are given with selected blood level studies. The antihyaluronidase effect of salicylic acid metabolites {{and the relationship of}} these phenolic compounds to the pituitary-adrenal axis are discussed. T HE {{chemical compounds}} known to sup-press the manifestations of rheumatic fever are phenolic acid derivatives and the hormones cortisone and adenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). These hormones have shed light on the pathogenesis of this disease but added little to our hope for better rheumatic fever therapy. Cortisone and adrenocortico-tropic hormone are most effective in the severe form of acute rheumatic fever, 31 - 2 but in gen-eral, their therapeutic results have been less sat-isfactory than those of salicylates 1 2, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12; the disease's manifestations recur when the hormones are stopped 4 5 9, 10, 11 and the effect on carditis and valvular damage is of doubtful value. A 2 The monophenolic salicylates con-tinue to be regarded as the most generally effective and practically useful form of rheu-matic fever therapy and can be used to dif-ferentiate rheumatic fever from other diseases which have similar symptomatology. It is significant that since the salicylates were introduced 75 years ago, 13 they have not been replaced in the treatment of rheumatic fever. The salicylates are but one of several phenoli...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>sodium</b> salicylate, benzoate, <b>gentisate,</b> m- and p-hydroxybenzoates, antipyrine, and 2 : 4 -dinitrophenol on the reduced {{glutathione}} concentration of rat liver were determined. An increase in {{concentration in the}} male, {{but not in the}} female, rats was found after salicylate, benzoate and gentisate; after antipyrine, a comparable increase occurred in the females only. There is a relation, in these compounds, between capacity to increase the concentration of reduced glutathione in the rat liver in one sex and therapeutic activity in rheumatic fever...|$|R
40|$|Gentisate:oxygen 1, 2 -oxidoreductase (decyclizing) (EC 1. 13. 11. 4; gentisate 1, 2 -dioxygenase) from Moraxella osloensis was {{purified}} to homogeneity {{as shown}} by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 154, 000 and gives rise to subunits of molecular weight 40, 000 {{in the presence of}} <b>sodium</b> dodecyl sulfate. <b>Gentisate</b> 1, 2 -dioxygenase showed broad substrate specificity and attacked a range of halogen- and alkyl-substituted gentisic acids. Maleylpyruvate, the product formed from gentisate, was degraded by cell extracts supplemented with reduced glutathione, but substituted maleylpyruvates were not attacked under these conditions...|$|R
40|$|Salicylate {{inhibition}} {{of the secondary}} antibody response initiated in vitro on day 0 has been studied in cultures of rabbit lymph node fragments. Levels of 1. 25 to 1. 5 mM (0. 20 to 0. 24 mg/ml) sodium salicylate present in serum-free medium throughout an 18 - or 21 -day culture period completely inhibit the secondary response. This inhibition is largely accomplished by the drug's action during the first 9 days, which corresponds to the inductive phase for this culture system. Relatively little inhibition is produced by adding the drug only after day 9, although over 90 % of the antibody produced during a 21 -day experiment is synthesized after day 9. Studies with media of different pH's show that this inhibition is more correctly {{a function of the}} nonionized salicylic acid concentration in the medium than of the total salicylate concentration. Arguments are presented against the possibility that salicylate at the levels used here inhibits antibody synthesis by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) produces the same degree of inhibition in vitro as do equimolar concentrations of <b>sodium</b> salicylate. <b>Gentisate</b> (5 -hydroxysalicylate) is 15 -fold more effective in producing 50 % inhibition than salicylate; its temporal pattern of inhibition {{is similar to that of}} salicylate...|$|R
