I consider an optimal storage policy under discretion and two optimal simple rules: a constant private <b>storage</b> <b>subsidy</b> and a price band. The <b>storage</b> <b>subsidy</b> achieves welfare gains similar to the discretionary policy. The price band maximizing social welfare is a price-peg scheme: The floor and ceiling prices are the same, and the capacity constraint represents 11 % of the steady-state production level. This price band achieves three-quarters of the gains from the optimal policy under discretion. Key words: discretion, food price stabilization, price volatility, storage. JEL codes: Q 11, Q 18.

In addition, we show that, compared with the formulated plan, a storage-oriented alternative plan reduces the fall in price observed after the hurricane, increases storage volume, increases the total gains in surplus of the overall sector but postpones the price rebound after the shock.

40|$|IFPRI Discussion Paper 01205 Currently, {{there is}} {{increased}} {{focus on the}} methods in which public interventions stabilize agricultural markets. The subsidization of private storage {{is one of the}} options advocated. However, the efficiency of such an instrument is still being discussed and has not yet been explored in the context of imperfect information. Nevertheless, {{this is one of the}} potential sources of market fluctuations and one of the arguments in favor of a public intervention on agricultural markets. To fill this gap, our main objective in this paper is to simulate the effects of a subsidization of storage costs, aimed at stimulating private storage at the world level, on markets fluctuations following Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms, so as to stimulate private storage at the world level, and to study the welfare effects of this public intervention. To do so, we conduct a dynamic general equilibrium analysis and assume that agents have imperfect expectations. We simulate the effects of a radical reform: the complete removal of the CAP in arable crops sectors; we then study the impacts of a subsidization of wheat storage costs at the world level. Our results first show that the CAP removal in arable crop sectors destabilizes European markets and tends to stabilize markets in the United States and in the rest of the world. Then, the subsidization of private storage effectively boosts the storage activity; it generates welfare losses, but these are very limited compared with the world welfare gains arising from the CAP removal. However, the effects of this subsidy on market volatilities are contrasted: we find some cases where crop markets are actually stabilized following the subsidy, but other cases with the opposite result, where markets are destabilized. To understand the factors related to the effects of the subsidy, we perform a logistic regression and show that results are dependent on the form of the agents’ expectations and on some distributional characteristics of the productivity shocks arising in the crop sectors. Namely, the more that information from the past is taken into account by economic agents to make their decision, and the more the productivity shocks are negatively auto correlated, the more the <b>storage</b> <b>subsidy</b> is efficient in stabilizing the markets...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of water management goals in protected wetland areas agriculturally managed in an intensive manner recalls {{the comparison of}} apples (ecological values) and oranges (economic dimension of agriculture). Sustainable wetland management frequently fails if environmental features are not referred to as ecosystem services and quantified in economic terms. In our hydrological-economical study on floodplain wetlands located in the Lower Basin of the Biebrza Valley, we attempt to quantify the monetary value of water storage in the floodplain during flood phenomena as an important ecosystem service. The unit monetary value of water storage in the catchment of Biebrza Valley was assessed {{on the basis of}} small artificial water reservoirs, constructed in recent years and located in the area of research, and reached 0. 53 EUR·m− 3 ·year− 1. In a GIS-based study on hydrological floodplain processes in the years 1995 – 2011, we assessed the average annual volume of active water storage in the floodplain which reached 10. 36 M m 3 year− 1, giving a monetary value of EUR 5. 49 million per annum. We propose that the methodology presented in our analysis could be applied as water <b>storage</b> <b>subsidies</b> in valuable floodplains, to prevent their deterioration originating from agriculture intensification...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo date {{there is}} limited {{knowledge}} of how having access to post-harvest storage technology affects a smallholder African farmer’s decision to adopt higher-yielding improved maize varieties. This is a key issue because higher yielding varieties {{are known to be}} more susceptible to storage pests than lower-yielding traditional varieties. We address this question using panel data from Malawi, and incorporating panel estimation techniques to deal with unobserved heterogeneity. Our results indicate that acquiring chemical storage protectants after the previous harvest is associated with a statistically significant and modest positive impact on the probability of adopting improved maize, total area planted to improved maize varieties, and share of area planted to improved maize varieties in the next planting season. We also find that the <b>storage</b> chemical <b>subsidy</b> is associated with significant crowding out of commercial storage chemical purchases, as farmers who acquire subsidized chemicals are more than 50 percentage points less likely to purchase commercial chemicals on average. These findings have implications for maize adoption and input subsidy policies, and they indicate that researchers, extension staff, and policy makers should consider post-harvest issue when promoting adoption of improved varieties...|$|R

40|$|Climate change {{mitigation}} requires gigaton-scale {{carbon dioxide}} removal technologies, yet few examples exist beyond niche markets. This dissertation informs large-scale implementation of bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS), a carbon-negative energy technology. It builds on existing literature {{with a novel}} focus on deployment, design, commercialization, and communication of BECCS. BECCS, combined with aggressive renewable deployment and fossil emission reductions, can enable a carbon-negative power system in Western North America by 2050, with up to 145 % emissions reduction from 1990 levels. BECCS complements other sources of renewable energy, and can be deployed {{in a manner consistent}} with regional policies and design considerations. The amount of biomass resource available limits the level of fossil CO 2 emissions that can still satisfy carbon emissions caps. Offsets produced by BECCS are more valuable to the power system than the electricity it provides. Implied costs of carbon for BECCS are relatively low (~$ 75 /ton CO 2 at scale) for a capital-intensive technology. Optimal scales for BECCS are an order of magnitude larger than proposed scales found in existing literature. Deviations from optimal scaled size have little effect on overall systems costs – suggesting that other factors, including regulatory, political, or logistical considerations, may ultimately have a greater influence on plant size than the techno-economic factors considered. The flexibility of thermochemical conversion enables a viable transition pathway for firms, utilities and governments to achieve net-negative CO 2 emissions in production of electricity and fuels given increasingly stringent climate policy. Primary research, development (R&D), and deployment needs are in large-scale biomass logistics, gasification, gas cleaning, and geological CO 2 <b>storage.</b> R&D programs, <b>subsidies,</b> and policy that recognize co-conversion processes can support this pathway to commercialization. Here, firms can embrace a gradual transition pathway to deep decarbonization, limiting economic dislocation and increasing transfer of knowledge between the fossil and renewable sectors. Global cumulative capital investment needs for BECCS through 2050 are over $ 1. 9 trillion (2015 $, 4 % real interest rate) for scenarios likely to limit global warming to 2 °C. This scenario envisions deployment of as much as 24 GW/yr of BECCS by 2040 in the electricity sector. To achieve theses rates of deployment within 15 - 20 years, governments and firms must commit to research, development, and deployment on an unprecedented scale. Three primary issues complicate emissions accounting for BECCS: cross-sector CO 2 accounting, regrowth, and timing. Switchgrass integration decreases lifecycle greenhouse gas impacts of co-conversion systems with CCS, across a wide range of land-use change scenarios. Risks at commercial scale include adverse effects on food security, land conservation, social equity, and biodiversity, as well as competition for water resources. This dissertation argues for an iterative risk management approach to BECCS sustainability, with standards being updated as more knowledge is gained through deployment. Sustainability impacts and public opposition to BECCS may be reduced with transparent measurement and communication. Commercial-scale deployment is dependent on the coordination of a wide range of actors, many with different incentives and worldviews. Despite this problem, this dissertation challenges governments, industry incumbents, and emerging players to research, support, and deploy BECCS...|$|R
