If charge deposition from impinging β- particles causes cross-talk between neighbour pixels, and accurate charge deposited is measured, sub-pixel resolution can be obtained, therefore potentially obtaining spatial resolution comparable to traditional film.

Using this approach better charge measurement is obtained, and even some background events are discarded, reducing the global noise level of the detector.

The authors use suitable local mathematical measures based on the Voronoi diagram of experimentally determined positions of epidermal plant hairs (trichomes) to examine the variability or noise in pattern formation. Although trichome initiation is a highly regulated process, the authors show that the experimentally observed trichome pattern is substantially disturbed by cell-to-cell variations.

The condition of thymine starvation leading to thymineless death (TLD) is at the cross-roads of replication and transcription. According to a current view, e. g., (Cagliero et al., 2014), one of the cellular objectives is to segregate the processes of transcription and replication in time and space. An ultimate segregation would take place when one process is inhibited and another is not, as it happens during thymine starvation, which results in numerous molecular and physiological abnormalities associated with TLD. One of such abnormalities is the loss of spatial correlations {{in the vicinity of the}} origin of replication.

However, in the latter case, 2 x 2 clusters generally serve as reliable indicators to whether a strategy survives. Stochasticity is added to investigate the effects of varying fractions of one strategy present at initialization time and to discuss the rich dynamic properties in greater detail.

40|$|Copyright © Inter-Research 2008 Many {{sedentary}} {{marine invertebrates}} have a fine-scale (100 s m) population structure that complicates their conservation and management. This {{is a consequence}} of the limited information on the boundaries between component populations and the biological variability among them. Blacklip abalone Haliotis rubra form discrete populations, many of which are ‘stunted’ with individuals reaching a maximum length less than those in adjacent areas. In the present study, we obtained information on the growth, size at maturity and fecundity of H. rubra from stunted and ‘non-stunted’ populations spread across broad (10 s km) and fine (100 s m) spatial scales. Relationships between each of these key population parameters and a simple ‘morphometric marker’ based on the relationship between shell length and shell height were also examined. Variation in broad-scale growth and size at maturity could primarily be attributed to differences between stunted and non-stunted sites. Within the stunted site, growth and size at maturity were substantially different over distances > 150 m. However, within the non-stunted site these parameters tended to be similar across 1000 m. While the lowest fecundities tended to be in the stunted sites, there was significant overlap among all sites. These <b>spatial</b> patterns in <b>biology</b> were highly correlated with the spatial variability observed in a simple morphometric marker.

However, in many cases, it remains unclear how best to synthesize information obtained from various scales and analysis approaches, such as atomistic molecular models, Markov state models (MSM), subcellular network models, and whole cell models. In this paper, we use protein kinase A (PKA) activation {{as a case study}} to explore how computational methods that model different physical scales can complement each other and integrate into an improved multiscale representation of the biological mechanisms. Using measured crystal structures, we show how molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with atomic-scale MSMs can provide conformations for Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations to feed transitional states and kinetic parameters into protein-scale MSMs. We discuss how milestoning can give reaction probabilities and forward-rate constants of cAMP association events by seamlessly integrating MD and BD simulation scales. These rate constants coupled with MSMs provide a robust representation of the free energy landscape, enabling access to kinetic and thermodynamic parameters unavailable from current experimental data. These approaches have helped to illuminate the cooperative nature of PKA activation in response to distinct cAMP binding events.

Specimens of A. typicus were associated with intertidal mangrove prop roots, seagrass meadows, sandy beaches, and shoals. Among prop roots, specimens were significantly smaller and had highest densities (131 ind. m- 2) between November and March. High organic matter in sediment and a relatively low predation rate seemed to support juvenile life among mangroves. Size and density analyses provided evidence that individuals gradually move to seagrass, sandy habitats, and shoals as they age. Specimens were significantly larger at a shoal (maximum radius R = 81 mm). New recruits were found between August and November in both 2008 and 2009. Timing of recruitment and population size frequencies confirmed a seasonal reproductive cycle. Juveniles had relatively high growth rates (2 – 7 mm month- 1) and may reach an R of 20 – 25 mm after 1 year. Growth rates of larger specimens (R > 30 mm) were generally < 2 mm month- 1.

An important goal in the quantitative analysis of such data is the evaluation and localization of differences in spatial distributions between groups. Because of experimental replications, achieving this goal requires comparing collections of point sets, a noticeably challenging issue for which no method has been proposed to date. We introduce a strategy to address this problem, based on the comparison of point intensities throughout space. Our method {{is based on a}} statistical test that determines whether local point intensities, estimated using replicated data, are significantly different or not. Repeating this test at different positions provides an intensity comparison map and reveals domains showing significant intensity differences. Simulated data were used to characterize and validate this approach. The method was then applied to two different neuroanatomical systems to evaluate its ability to reveal spatial differences in biological data sets. Applied to two distinct neuronal populations within the rat spinal cord, the method generated an objective representation of the spatial segregation established previously on a subjective visual basis. The method was also applied to analyze the spatial distribution of locus coeruleus neurons in control and mutant mice. The results objectively consolidated previous conclusions obtained from visual comparisons. Remarkably, they also provided new insights into the maturation of the locus coeruleus in mutant and control animals. Overall, the method introduced here is a new contribution to the quantitative analysis of biological organizations that provides meaningful spatial representations which are easy to understand and to interpret.

40|$|Modeling the {{geographical}} distributions of wildlife species {{is important for}} ecology and conservation <b>biology.</b> <b>Spatial</b> autocorrelation in species distributions poses a problem for distribution modeling because it invalidates the assumption of independence among sample locations. I explored the prevalence and causes of spatial autocorrelation in data from the Breeding Bird Survey, covering the conterminous United States, using Regression Trees, Conditional Autoregressive Regressions (CAR), and the partitioning of variance. I also constructed a simulation model to investigate dispersal as a process contributing to spatial autocorrelation, and attempted to verify the connection between dispersal and spatial autocorrelation in species’ distributions in empirical data, using three indirect indices of dispersal. All 108 bird species modeled showed strong spatial autocorrelation, which was significantly better modeled with CAR models than with traditional regression-based distribution models. Not all autocorrelation {{could be explained by}} spatial autocorrelation in the underlying environmental factors, suggesting another process at work, which I hypothesized to be dispersal. In the simulation model, dispersal produced additional autocorrelation in the distribution of population abundances. The effect of dispersal on autocorrelation was modulated by the potential population growth rate, with low growth rates leading to a stronger effect. The effect of dispersal on population sizes was different between populations at the periphery and core of a range. Due to their relative isolation, peripheral populations received fewer immigrants than populations at the core, causing lower population sizes. Dispersal could therefore be an explanation for range structures independent of environmental conditions. The verification of dispersal as a partial cause of autocorrelation failed. The most plausible cause was the indirectness of the indices used to represent dispersal. Distribution modelers should generally include space explicitly in their models, especially for species with low potential population growth rates. Dispersal has a strong potential to shape species distributions and requires more explicit consideration in distribution models and conservation plans. To reach this goal, direct research on dispersal distances and strength is urgently needed.

In this thesis, we present various modelling formalisms with spatial features, each using a different abstraction level of the real space. From the formalisms with the most abstract notion of space, to the most concrete, we formally define the MIM Calculus with compartments, the Spatial P systems, and the Spatial CLS. Each formalism is suitable for the description of different kinds of systems, which call for the use of different space modelling abstractions. We present models of various real-world systems which benefit from the ability to precisely describe space-dependent behaviours. We define the MIM Calculus, inspired by Molecular Interaction Maps, a graphical notation for bioregulatory networks. The MIM Calculus provides high-level operators with a direct biological meaning, which are used to describe the interaction capabilities of the elements of such systems. Its spatial extension includes the most abstract notion of space, namely it only allows the modelling of compartments. Such a feature allows distinguishing only the abstract position where an element is, identified by the name of the compartment. Subsequently, we propose a spatial extension to the membrane computing formalism P systems. In this case, we follow a more precise approach to spatial modelling, by embedding membranes and objects in a two-dimensional discrete space. Some objects of a Spatial P system can be declared as mutually exclusive objects, with the constraint that each position can accommodate at most one of them. The distinction between ordinary and mutually exclusive objects {{can be thought of as}} an abstraction on the size of the objects. We study the computational complexity of the formalism and the problem of efficient simulation of some kinds of models. Finally, we present the Spatial Calculus of Looping Sequences (Spatial CLS), which is an extension of the Calculus of Looping Sequences (CLS), a formalism geared towards the modelling of cellular systems. In this case, models are based on two/three dimensional continuous space, and allow an accurate description of the motion of the elements, and of their size. In particular, Spatial CLS allows the description of the space occupied by elements and membranes, which can change their sizes dynamically as the system evolves. Space conflicts which may occur can be resolved by performing a rearrangement of elements and membranes. As example applications of the calculus we present a model of cell proliferation, and a model of the quorum sensing process in Pseudomonas aeruginosa...|$|R
40|$|Biotic {{interactions}} such as insect infestations may damage organisms {{but they}} also play their role in ecosystem processes. Insect defoliators and woodborers, including beetles, moths, and horntail wasps, are widely recognized as agents of ecosystem disturbance that can influence forest production and nutrient cycling. Insect infestations can create large-scale forest diebacks. Infesting insects feed and make their homes on bark, trunks, and branches of trees and shrubs. Insect borers damage plants by tunneling through the inner bark and cambium; if the stem is completely girdled, the plant dies {{at or above the}} damaged site. If the tree is weakened structurally, leaves and branches may fall. Insect damage can severely affect the quality of timber, and render trees susceptible to disease and secondary fungal infestation. As resources are reallocated to compensate for herbivore damage, the productive capacity of a tree may be reduced. Insect infestation is a scientifically neglected problem in mangrove research and management. This is partly due to the perception that the tannins in mangroves render them inedible to most herbivorous insects, and that tidal flooding inhibits insect population growth. Consequently, insects that attack mangroves are understudied, with a few exceptions. Insect infestations in mangrove forests in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region have not been well-documented, though several outbreaks have occurred in this area. For instance, in 2003, substantial stands of Rhizophora mucronata Lamk. were defoliated in the Pemba region of Tanzania. In Kiunga and Lamu, where the largest contiguous mangrove forests of Kenya are found, an unknown insect pest is thought to be responsible for the dieback of R. mucronata over the last two decades. However, this infestation has never been studied. A 2005 survey reported a decline of Sonneratia alba J. Smith due to an insect infestation that rapidly spread northwards towards the mangroves of Somalia. This infestation was attributed to a cerambycid beetle and a metarbelid moth, the taxonomic status of which is currently under revision. In Kenya, these insects are reported to have an overlapping geographical range, but they appear in different locations on the host trees. The symptoms of infestation in S. alba populations suggested that more than one insect species infests S. alba. To date, there exist insufficient and conflicting reports on the identity of these insects, their <b>spatial</b> distribution and <b>biology,</b> and the extent and severity of infestation. This study reports on the identity of the insects, their distribution along the Kenyan coast, and the level and extent of the infestation of S. alba populations.

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{carbonate}} minerals calcite, aragonite and dolomite (and their rock-counterparts) precipitate {{directly from}} fluids. The mineral-yielding fluids must contain the necessary chemical constituents calcium, magnesium, carbon and oxygen. As the carbonates precipitate they inherit and incorporate chemical signatures that are ultimately {{governed by the}} nature of formation fluids. Therefore, carbonate rocks and minerals can be treated as geologic reservoirs for information concerning past fluid chemistries and very powerful geochemical databases.; All sedimentary rocks, including carbonates, form directly on or near Earth's surface typically in close <b>spatial</b> association with <b>biology.</b> It is well documented that carbonate minerals can form via the influence of organisms (biotic) or independent of biological processes (abiotic). In addition while some carbonates may precipitate abiotically, biological processes that influence fluid conditions have the possibility of being recorded in carbonate minerals. Therefore the study of carbonates is important not only in geological and chemical contexts but also in a biological context as a direct result and/or a passive recorder of such processes.; The following dissertation describes five projects that exploit this carbonate mineral geochemical reservoir across a range of geologic settings. The carbonates presented in the following chapters can be categorized based on their relative time of formation compared to the deposition of the associated geologic unit. These categories are 1) primary, or syndepositional carbonates and 2) diagenetic, or carbonates precipitated post depositionally and prior to metamorphic temperature and pressure ranges. Both sedimentary regimes are suitable for biology and diagenetic environments in particular can be strongly controlled by microbial processes.; In the following studies isotopic, trace elemental, trace compound, petrographic, stratigraphic and textural data are combined {{in order to determine the}} formation environments of carbonates and the characteristics of carbonate-yielding fluids. Given the major constituents of carbonate minerals listed above, isotopic analyses of carbon and oxygen are critical measurements and can provide a great deal of evidence regarding the sources and cycling of theses two elements. Oxygen isotopes in carbonates are influenced by a multitude of processes (discussed in detail in the following chapters) most of which are directly reflective of fluid temperatures and their isotopic compositions, both of which can help distinguish between primary or diagenetic environments. Trace element concentrations of iron, manganese and strontium are exploited in chapter 2 in order to further constrain the influence of diagenesis on primary chemical signatures.; Carbon is a major constituent of not only carbonate minerals but also organic compounds, making is isotopic characterization in carbonate minerals a valuable tracer of the sources of carbon in sedimentary environments (Claypool and Kaplan, 1974). As with carbon, sulfur is strongly influenced by biologic processes. Carbonates incorporate trace amounts of sulfate upon precipitation (Burdett et al., 1986) and this sulfate has been shown to substitute directly for the carbonate ion within the crystal lattice (Pingitore et al., 1995). This sulfate is referred to as carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) and can be extracted and analyzed for not only its bulk concentration but also its isotopic composition, both of which are dictated {{by the nature of}} carbonate-yielding fluids (Burdett et al., 1986). Carbonate formation environment can be further characterized when analysis of CAS (the oxidized sulfur species) is combined with isotopic and abundance analyses of pyrite (the dominant reduced sulfur phase in geologic settings). Therefore carbonate minerals act as geologic reservoirs for sulfur systematics as well. The following chapters describe studies which employ all or some of the above geochemical measurements in addition to more traditional geologic approaches such as petrography and stratigraphy.; Chapters 1 and 2 deal with Neoproterozoic to middle Cambrian units from northwestern Mexico and eastern California. These deposits are interpreted here as largely primary, however the influence of diagenesis is identified and discussed in each. This time interval is characterized by perhaps the most extreme evolutionary radiation experienced in Earth history, the so-called "Cambrian Explosion". It has long been proposed that certain chemical conditions must have existed in order to support such a drastic radiation, in particular increased marine oxygen concentrations. The data presented here suggests that this time interval was characterized by oceans with low sulfate concentrations [...] sulfate is a redox sensitive compound and is expected to increase in tandem with oxygen. These results require a reevaluation of the Earth's oceans during such an evolutionary significant time interval.; Chapters 3 and 4 focus on carbonate concretions from the Miocene Monterey Formation and the late Cretaceous Holz Shale. Concretions have long been known to form within sediments and their distinction as diagenetic is not largely debated. In these chapters, I show that concretionary carbonates retain signatures consistent with particular microbial processes, and directly identify that sulfur cycling plays a large role in past marine sedimentary regimes. In most cases, the identified microbial processes are likely directly responsible for carbonate mineralization. Concretions of the Monterey Formation exhibit chemical characteristics consistent with formation in sediments experiencing organic matter degradation via oxidation by nitrate and/or metal oxides and sulfate. Methanogenesis and sulfide oxidation were also active in zones of concretion precipitation in sediments of the Monterey Formation. Calcitic concretions of the Holz Shale possibly formed in zones experiencing extensive sulfide oxidation. Sulfide oxidation has, until now, not been identified as a reaction associated with carbonate authigenesis.; Chapter 5 highlights the possibility of forming potentially primary-like sedimentary textures through diagenetic processes in the Beck Spring Dolomite of eastern California. In this deposit, an extensive, laminated texture is most reasonably interpreted as diagenetic when geochemical, textural and petrographic data are considered together. This study demonstrates that the distinction between primary and diagenetic must not be made solely on field-based criteria...|$|R
40|$|The {{recognition}} of stocks, or spatially separate groups {{of individuals with}} persistent differences in biological characteristics, {{is important for the}} sustainable and optimised use of fisheries resources. Stocks with different biological characteristics may respond differently to harvest and therefore have different vulnerabilities to over-exploitation. Recent research suggests that spatial variation in biological characteristics at a range of scales is a feature of many coral reef fishes. An investigation of the temporal stability of spatial differences and the identification of stocks that may require separate management strategies, however, has rarely been undertaken for such fish. Moreover, {{little is known about the}} implications of spatial differences in biological characteristics for spatially separate components as well as entire populations of coral reef fishes when subject to various levels of harvest. This thesis has four primary aims: 1) to investigate the use of otolith chemistry as an indirect indicator of stock structure of three exploited epinepheline serranid coral reef fishes, Plectropomus leopardus, Cephalopholis cyanostigma and Epinephelus fasciatus, on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia; 2) to investigate the use of otolith morphology as an indirect indicator of stock structure of P. leopardus; 3) to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns in life history characteristics of P. leopardus as direct manifestations of stock structure; and 4) to examine the implications of spatial variability in life history characteristics of P. leopardus for harvest strategy evaluation. The first two aims were achieved by comparing otolith chemistry (Mn, Sr, Ba) and otolith morphology (otolith length, width, area, perimeter, circularity, rectangularity and Fourier Harmonics) variables among four regions of the GBR, separated by 100 s of kilometres, as well as among three reefs 100 s – 1000 s of meters apart within each region. The temporal stability in otolith chemistry and morphology signals was also examined by comparing two cohorts of P. leopardus and individuals of C. cyanostigma and E. fasciatus from the same cohorts that were collected two years before and two years after a significant weather disturbance (Tropical Cyclone Justin) in March 1997. Persistent differences in otolith chemistry were found at both broad and fine spatial scales, and differences in otolith morphology were seen at mainly broad spatial scales. Moreover, some aspects of chemical and morphological signals differed between cohorts and individuals collected before and after the Cyclone. The results highlight the need to incorporate data from several years in studies using these techniques to discriminate temporary and possibly misleading signals from those that indicate persistent spatial structure in stocks. These results provide a good starting point for future research on groups of individuals that have lived at least part of their lives in different environments and therefore may have different biological characteristics, although otolith chemistry and morphology should not be used in isolation to determine stock structure. The third aim was achieved by comparing vital life history characteristics of P. leopardus at the same broad regional and finer reef scale as the otolith chemistry and morphology. Temporal stability in stock structure was examined by comparing biological parameters among five consecutive years, from 1995 to 1999. The results matched the patterns indicated by otolith chemistry and morphology and emphasised that the stock structure of P. leopardus is far more complex than assumed previously. Mortality, growth, age richness and longevity of P. leopardus varied among reefs within regions and some estimates of growth and longevity also varied at the larger regional spatial scale. Several of the spatial patterns in these biological parameters were complicated by inter-annual variation. Similar to the use of otolith chemistry and morphology, the life history results emphasised the importance of a multi-scaled sampling design, including a temporal component, when using biological characteristics to investigate the stock structure of tropical reef fishes. I proposed a theoretical model for conceptualising the stock identification and management challenge for P. leopardus that may be composed of a complex network of reef subpopulations, groups of subpopulations (i. e., regions), and potential stocks with persistent differences in biology. The fourth aim was achieved using a spatially-structured management strategy evaluation model developed for P. leopardus harvested by the GBR line fishery. Relative spawning biomass of the population was estimated from simulations of four hypothetical scenarios of spatial variation in life history characteristics under each of five hypothetical effort scenarios. The life history scenarios involved simulating the P. leopardus population with or without differences in a) individual growth and b) mortality rates among four regions of the GBR. The different effort scenarios involved shifting fishing effort among the four regions. The effects of regional closures (no effort) were also examined. Trajectories of mean relative spawning biomass were compared among the different combinations of spatial and effort scenarios. Relative mean spawning biomass trajectories were also compared between two analytical approaches involving aggregating results over regions, as is usually done in fisheries assessments, or treating results separately for each region. The latter comparison directly assessed the impacts of erroneously assuming an homogeneous stock despite regional variation in life history parameters. Including spatial variation in growth and mortality resulted in greater depletions of relative spawning biomass and longer times to recover relative to exploitation levels for the population as a whole, as well as for several regions. Aggregating results across regions masked important region-specific patterns in the relative spawning biomass trajectories arising from <b>spatial</b> variation in <b>biology,</b> and so resulted in the wrong conclusions about whether particular management objectives were likely to be realised. These results suggest that spatial variation in growth, in particular, mortality and potentially other life history characteristics should be incorporated in future harvest strategy evaluations for P. leopardus. Further, the results suggest that the single management unit currently in place for P. leopardus on the GBR may need to be divided into finer spatial units to closer reflect biological stock units to deliver prudent biologically optimal harvests. The results clearly have some important implications for the management and harvest of P. leopardus on the GBR. P. leopardus, and probably many other exploited coral reef fishes, should not be viewed or managed as single homogenous populations. Instead these populations should be considered as complex networks of spatially and temporally varying components which although interlinked, may require separate management strategies to assure their long-term sustainability and optimal harvest. ...|$|R
