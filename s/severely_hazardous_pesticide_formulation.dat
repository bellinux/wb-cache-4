40|$|BACKGROUND: By statute or {{regulation}} in the United States and elsewhere, pesticide ingredients {{are divided into}} two categories: active and inert (sometimes referred to as other ingredients, adjuvants, or coformulants). Despite their name, inert ingredients may be biologically or chemically active and are labeled inert only because of their function in the formulated product. Most of the tests required to register a pesticide are performed with the active ingredient alone, not the full <b>pesticide</b> <b>formulation.</b> Inert ingredients are generally not identified on product labels and are often claimed to be confidential business information. OBJECTIVES: In this commentary, we describe the shortcomings of the current procedures for assessing the hazards of <b>pesticide</b> <b>formulations</b> and demonstrate that inert ingredients can increase the toxicity of and potential exposure to <b>pesticide</b> <b>formulations.</b> DISCUSSION: Inert ingredients can increase the ability of <b>pesticide</b> <b>formulations</b> to affect significant toxicologic end points, including developmental neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, and disruption of hormone function. They can also increase exposure by increasing dermal absorption, decreasing the efficacy of protective clothing, and increasing environmental mobility and persistence. Inert ingredients can increase the phytotoxicity of <b>pesticide</b> <b>formulations</b> {{as well as the}} toxicity to fish, amphibians, and microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: Pesticide registration should require full assessment of <b>formulations.</b> Evaluations of <b>pesticides</b> under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and similar statutes should include impact assessment of formulations. Environmental monitoring for pesticides should include inert ingredients. To enable independent research and risk assessment, inert ingredients should be identified on product labels...|$|R

40|$|Acute {{pesticide}} poisoning is a {{major public}} health problem in Sri Lanka. In several agricultural districts, it precedes all other causes of death in government hospitals. Most of the acute poisoning cases are intentional (suicide) and occur among young adults, mainly males. Poisoning due to occupational exposure is also common, but less well documented. In an irrigation area in Sri Lanka a very high incidence of serious pesticide poisoning was observed, with 68 % due to intentional ingestion of liquid pesticides. It is argued that the easy availability and widespread use of highly <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticides</b> {{is the most important}} reason for this high number of poisoning cases. The frequent application of highly <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticides</b> in high concentrations was often irrational and posed serious health and financial risks to the farmers. Sales promotion activities and credit facilities promoted this excessive pesticide use, which was not counteracted by an agricultural extension service. Hazardous practices when spraying pesticides were due to the impossibility of applying recommended protective measures under the local conditions, rather than to lack of knowledge. Current emphasis on programs that promote the safe use of pesticides through education and training of farmers will be ineffective in Sri Lanka because knowledge is already high and most poisoning cases are intentional. Instead, enforcement of legislation to restrict availability of the most <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticides</b> would result in an immediate health benefit. Improved agricultural extension services to promote alternative non-chemical methods of pest control is the most important strategy, in the long term, to prevent acute pesticide poisoning.

40|$|The {{focal point}} of this project is mixture effects caused by pesticides, and in {{particular}} mixture effects of mixtures in which pesticide adjuvants (co-formulants) is a part. As a first step, the project examines how the current European (EU) pesticide legislation and the consequent ecological risk assessment applied in the Nordic approval-zone relate to mixture effects of mixtures where co-formulants is a part. It is concluded that the ecological risk assessment performed during the approval of <b>pesticide</b> <b>formulations</b> in accordance to the relevant legislation, to a wide extent does {{take into account the}} contribution of co-formulants to the toxicity of <b>pesticide</b> <b>formulations.</b> Requirements of ecotoxicological examination of mandatory tank mixes (i. e. mixtures of <b>pesticides</b> <b>formulations</b> or the addition of pesticide adjuvants, according to the label required for optimum effect) are also included in the legislation. However, there are no test requirements for mixtures of <b>pesticide</b> <b>formulations</b> applied to the field, solely {{in order to reduce the}} number of applications (i. e. non-mandatory tank mixtures), or to mixtures of <b>pesticide</b> <b>formulations</b> generated by sequential field application. Since there are no tests requirements for non-mandatory tank mixtures, which is the most frequently used application method of pesticides, or for sequential mixtures, there is good reason to believe that there occurs mixture effects that are not taken into account, neither in the current European pesticides legislation nor in the Nordic ecological risk assessment. Hence, it was suggested that inclusion of risk assessment of these non-mandatory mixtures could improve the European pesticides legislation. In addition to the legislative and regulatory analysis, the toxic mixture effects of the active ingredient of the widely used RoundUp herbicde, glyphosate, and the co-formulant, POEA, to the ordinary yellow onion, Allium cepa, was examined in a root growth inhibition assay and by applying the use of a "fixed-ratio" study design. The experiment is performed in five mixture ratios (1 : 0, 1 : 0. 2, 1 : 0. 6, 1 : 1. 9, and 0 : 1 (glyphosate: POEA concentration ratio)). Mixture effects were assessed in relation to the concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models. The observed mixing effects were characterized as being Bliss antagonistic, both at high (EC 50 -level) and low (EC 10 -level) concentrations and Loewe additive at high concentrations and weak Loewe antagonistic at low concentrations. It was found that CA, despite the fact that glyphosate and POEA has a fundamentally different toxic mode of action, would be a useful prediction model to assess the mixture effects of glyphosate and POEA and probably also other mixtures of active substances and co-formulants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The use {{of highly}} <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticides</b> by {{smallholder}} farmers constitutes a classic trans-sectoral ‘wicked problem’. We share our program {{of research in}} potato and vegetable farming communities in the Andean highlands, working with partners from multiple sectors to confront this problem over several projects. Methods We engaged in iterative cycles of mixed methods research around particular questions, actions relevant to stakeholders, new proposal formulation and implementation followed by evaluation of impacts. Capacity building occurred among farmers, technical personnel, and students from multiple disciplines. Involvement of research users occurred throughout: women and men farmers, non-governmental development organizations, Ministries of Health and Agriculture, and, in Ecuador, the National Council on Social Participation. Results Pesticide poisonings were more widespread than existing passive surveillance systems would suggest. More diversified, moderately developed agricultural systems had lower pesticide use and better child nutrition. Greater understanding among women of crop management options and more equal household gender relations were associated with reduced farm pesticide use and household pesticide exposure. Involvement in more organic agriculture was associated with greater household food security and food sovereignty. Markets for safer produce supported efforts by smallholder farmers to reduce <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticide</b> use. Participatory interventions included: promoting greater access to alternative methods and inputs in a store co-sponsored by the municipality; producing less harmful inputs such as compost by women farmers; strengthening farmer organizations around healthier and more sustainable agriculture; marketing safer produce among social sectors; empowering farmers to act as social monitors; and using social monitoring results to inform decision makers. Uptake by policy makers has included: the Ecuadorian Ministry of Health rolling out pesticide poisoning surveillance modeled on our system; the Ecuadorian Association of Municipalities holding a national virtual forum on healthier agriculture; and the Ecuadorian Ministry of Agriculture promulgating restrictions on highly <b>hazardous</b> <b>pesticides</b> in June 2010. Conclusion Work with multiple actors is needed to shift agriculture towards greater sustainability and human health, particularly for vulnerable smallholders. </p...|$|R

The insecticidal {{properties of}} lauric acid based <b>pesticide</b> <b>formulation</b> against aphids were evaluated through the three main routes of exposure: topical application, leaf-dipping (ingestion) and inhalation. Surface tension dependent aphids toxicity was also investigated by measuring the surface tension value of each formulation prepared. The relationship of surface tension and formulation toxicity was then observed on aphid tested. The obtained results indicate that all tested formulations had insecticidal activity against tested aphids depending on exposure method and lauric acid concentration. The topical application method recorded 100 % mortality rates {{compared to the other}} two methods. With topical application method, most of the aphids died soon after treatment. Toxicity symptoms from lauric acid to aphids included unusual abdominal contractions which caused quick loss of coordination and decreased activity, and finally dehydration and necrosis within 24 hours. Results from surface tension study revealed close connection between toxicity and surface tension. This might lead to the conclusion that toxicity was possibly related to aphid suffocation in the highly wettable solution. Results from this research also demonstrated that there were possibility that lauric acid do not only kill aphids by suffocation, but also through change of cuticle and cell permeability and desiccation that lead to speedy death due to the chemical nature of lauric acid.

40|$|Abstract—Freshwater mussels {{are among}} the most imperiled faunal groups in North America; {{approximately}} 67 % of the nearly 300 native freshwater mussel species (family Unionidae) are listed as endangered, threatened, or of special concern. Despite evidence that glochidia and juvenile life stages are highly sensitive to some chemical contaminants, the effects of pesticides on early life stages of unionid mussels are largely unknown. In the United States, pesticide registration is based on toxicity data of the active ingredient, not formulations as they are sold and applied. Some <b>pesticide</b> <b>formulations,</b> however, are more toxic than their active ingredient (technical-grade pesticide) alone {{because of the presence of}} surfactants, adjuvants, or other ingredients in the formulation. The objective of the present study was to compare the toxicity of active ingredients of several current-use pesticides (atrazine, chlorpyrifos, and permethrin) to the toxicity of <b>pesticide</b> <b>formulations</b> to glochidia and juvenile life stages of a freshwater mussel (Lampsilis siliquoidea). The atrazine formulation (Aatrex) was more toxic than technical-grade atrazine in chronic tests with juvenile L. siliquoidea. For other pesticides, acute and chronic toxicity of technical-grade pesticides were similar to the toxicity of <b>pesticide</b> <b>formulations.</b> Median effective concentrations for chlorpyrifos were 0. 43 mg/L for glochidia at 48 h, 0. 25 mg/L for juveniles at 96 h, and 0. 06 mg/L for juveniles at 21 d.
