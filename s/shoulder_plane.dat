This cross-sectional study tested straight-arm grip strengths of 104 apparently healthy adults, ages 18 to 82, in three different positions of shoulder flexion: above the head (180 ° frontal <b>plane</b> <b>shoulder</b> flexion), towards the front (90 ° frontal <b>plane</b> <b>shoulder</b> flexion), and down to the side (0 ° frontal <b>plane</b> <b>shoulder</b> flexion). The position orders were randomized, and the best of three for each position was analyzed for data. A 2 -way (gender by shoulder position) ANOVA with repeated measures on the shoulder position main effect was used to analyze the data. A Bonferroni post-hoc test was employed to isolate specific differences that could be attributed to shoulder position. It was found that, although the men's and women's means and standard deviations differed for the three positions, {{the way in which the}} scores varied was the same. Both genders displayed the greatest grip strength in the following order: above > down > front. It is possible that the above position allows for the greatest grip strength due to the synergistic effect of the muscles supporting the shoulder in full flexion. Further research is needed to confirm as well as explain these results. Honors CollegeThesis (B. S. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposed}} a child-friendly measurement procedure for the three-dimensional analysis of upper limb movements, {{based on a}} comprehensive movement protocol. Within and between session reliability was tested {{in a group of}} 10 typically developing children (TDC) (mean age 10. 3 ± 3. 2 years). The movement protocol was constructed for children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP) and contained three reach tasks (forwards, upwards, sideways), three reach-to-grasp tasks (with objects requiring different hand orientations) and three gross motor tasks. Upper limb kinematics were calculated following the ISB-guidelines. Reliability of movement duration/speed and endpoint joint angles was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient; similarity of the waveforms with the coefficient of multiple correlation; measurement errors were also calculated. Reliability coefficients were generally high for movement duration/speed and most kinematic parameters. Endpoint angles for scapular tilting, <b>shoulder</b> elevation <b>plane</b> and elevation, elbow flexion-extension and wrist ulnar-radial deviation showed highest reliability. Angular waveforms were best repeated for scapular medio-lateral rotation and pro-retraction, <b>shoulder</b> elevation <b>plane</b> and elevation, and elbow flexion-extension. Results also seemed task-dependent. This study indicated that the proposed procedure could be used reliably to quantify upper limb movements in TDC. However, to compose proper age-related standards for the different tasks, larger study samples are needed. This will also help with a well-founded task-selection depending on the joints of interest.

40|$|PURPOSE: Despite {{increasing}} interest in bio-impedance analysis (BIA) for estimation of segmental skeletal muscle mass (SMM), published results {{have not been}} entirely convincing. Furthermore, {{a better understanding of}} the relationship between muscle strength and SMM will be useful in interpreting outcomes of physical/training interventions particularly in groups with diverse body sizes (e. g. men vs women). This study aimed to measure SMM in the upper body (upper extremity and torso), to determine its correlation with muscle strength and to examine the effects of gender on muscle strength-muscle mass relationship. METHODS: Segmental (upper extremity and torso) SMM and muscle strength in five distinct <b>shoulder</b> <b>planes</b> (forward flexion, abduction in scapular plane, abduction in coronal plane, internal and external rotation) were measured in 45 healthy participants (22 males, 23 females) with mean age 30. 3 years. Statistical analysis included independent t tests, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Men and women differed significantly in body mass (BMI: 25. 9 ± 4. 3 vs 23 ± 3. 6) and SMM (p < 0. 01). A strong relationship correlation was found between the five shoulder strength measurements and upper extremity SMM (r = 0. 66 - 0. 80, p < 0. 01), which was not affected by gender. There was a significant gender difference (p < 0. 01) in absolute shoulder strength, but not after normalisation to the SMM. CONCLUSION: BIA-estimated SMM of upper extremity and torso was highly correlated with upper extremity (shoulder) strength independent of gender. SMM may, therefore, be useful for the normalisation of muscle strength allowing size-independent comparisons of muscle strength in individuals with diverse physical characteristics...|$|R

Methods:This cross-sectional feasibility study included six healthy adult men with no impairment in shoulder motion. The single-joint HAL was fixed to a custom-designed platform and upper arm attachment, and aligned 3 cm below the acromion process. Vital signs, shoulder fatigue, and shoulder pain were evaluated before and after the shoulder elevation exercise performed with and without the HAL. Activity of selected muscles of the shoulder was recorded using a wireless superficial electromyography device. Shoulder movement was captured using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. Results:The HAL supported smooth flexion-extension of the arm at the shoulder joint, with no negative effects on vital signs, shoulder fatigue, and shoulder pain. The HAL decreased muscle activity levels, with a 55 % decrease in trapezius muscle activity.

40|$|Baseplate {{fixation}} in {{a reverse}} shoulder arthroplasty depends on adequate bone stock. In cases of severe glenoid bone loss and revision shoulder arthroplasty, deficiency of the glenoid vault compels the surgeon to attain screw fixation {{in the three}} columns of the scapula. The relationship of these columns demonstrated that the coracoid {{is closer to the}} lateral scapular pillar in females than in males. Significant gender dimorphism exists between the orientations of the three columns. The gender dimorphism is further evaluated by anthropometric measurements of the scapular body and the glenoid. The clinical significance lies in the ability to reconstruct the glenoid to its premorbid anatomy, there by being able to predict the glenoid dimensions from scapular body dimensions. Adequate positioning of the glenoid baseplate requires it to be positioned orthogonal to the scapular plane. Typically, calculation of the scapular plane relies on the glenoid being intact. As such, the scapular plane cannot be recreated if the glenoid has an abnormal morphology. This mandates the utilization of alternate planes that are independent of glenoid reference points. A relationship between the various planes independent of the glenoid reference points and the current scapular plane dependent upon the normal glenoid anatomy has been established.

Fourteen first-grade fast bowlers {{with a mean age of}} 23 years participated in the study. Physical capacities assessed were abdominal strength, trunk stability, selected girth and skinfold measures. During the delivery stride, bowlers were filmed from an overhead and lateral perspective (50 Hz) to obtain two-dimensional data for transverse <b>plane</b> <b>shoulder</b> alignment and sagittal plane knee joint angle respectively.

Retroreflective markers were positioned on the main spine processes and acromions to be detected by a TV-based motion analysis system. A model of kinematic computation was implemented and integrated in a previously developed protocol for multifactorial gait analysis. Movements in the main reference planes and in relation to pelvis were analysed. The trunk was on average bent forward by 3. 4 degrees with respect to standing; of the two physiological curves in the sagittal plane only lordosis changed during walking; in the frontal plane, a dynamic spine deformation appeared, that was maximum at heel strike-early stance; the trunk was bent controlaterally of the foot on the ground, while the shoulders remained stable; in the horizontal <b>plane,</b> the <b>shoulders</b> rotated contralaterally to the pelvis.

40|$|AIM: To {{develop a}} better {{understanding}} of scapulohumeral rhythm during scapular <b>plane</b> <b>shoulder</b> elevation. METHODS: Thirteen healthy, college-aged subjects participated in this study. Subjects were free from any upper extremity, neck or back pathology. A modified digital inclinometer was utilized to measure scapular upward rotation of the subject&#x 2019;s dominant shoulder. Upward rotation was measured statically as subjects performed clinically relevant amounts of shoulder elevation in the scapular plane. Testing order was randomized by arm position. Scapular upward rotation was assessed over the entire arc of motion and over a series of increments. The percent contributions to shoulder elevation for the scapula and glenohumeral joint were calculated. Scapulohumeral rhythm was assessed and represented the ratio of glenohumeral motion to scapulothoracic motion (glenohumeral elevation: scapular upward rotation). A one-way ANOVA was used to compare scapular upward rotation between elevation increments. RESULTS: Scapulohumeral rhythm for the entire arc of shoulder elevation was equal to a ratio of 2. 34 : 1 and ranged from 40. 01 : 1 to 0. 90 : 1 when assessed across the different increments of humeral elevation. Total scapular motion increased over the arc of shoulder elevation. The scapula contributed 2. 53 % of total motion for the first 30 degrees of shoulder elevation, between 20. 87 % and 37. 53 % for 30 o- 90 o of shoulder elevation, and 52. 73 % for 90 o- 120 o of shoulder elevation. Statistically significant differences in scapular upward rotation were identified across the shoulder elevation increments [F(3, 48) = 12. 63, P = 0. 0001]. CONCLUSION: Clinically, we must recognize the usefulness of the inclinometer in documenting the variable nature of scapulohumeral rhythm in healthy and injured shoulders...|$|R
40|$|Empirical and {{simulation}} {{studies are}} described which assess {{the form of}} central control signals for human limb movement. Recent claims about the complexity of control signals are addressed using a mathematical model of two-joint planar arm movement. The model {{is based on the}} lambda version of the equilibrium point hypothesis and includes neural control signals, reflexes, reflex delays, muscle mechanical properties, realistic musculo-skeletal geometry, limb dynamics and external loads. It is shown that ostensibly "complex" features of limb motion such as the " 2 / 3 power law" and non-monotonic patterns of limb impedance are predicted using simple constant-rate equilibrium shifts which do not explicitly encode these movement properties. In addition it is shown that simulated limb impedance using the A model both during movement and in statics matches empirically estimated values of impedance reported in the literature. Empirical studies assessed the control of muscle coactivation by measuring tonic levels of electromyographic activity in shoulder and elbow muscles at the end of reaching movements in a horizontal <b>plane.</b> <b>Shoulder</b> muscle coactivation was related to the amplitude and velocity of shoulder motion, and unrelated to elbow motion whereas elbow and double-joint muscle activity was related to elbow motion, and unrelated to shoulder motion. It is suggested that muscle coactivation at the shoulder and elbow may be controlled independently. Other experiments addressed the extent to which control signals are adjusted to account for interaction torques [...] -torques arising at one joint due to the motion of limb segments about adjacent joints. Electromyographic activity of limb muscles was measured during single- and multi-joint movements in which the magnitude or direction of interaction torque was systematically varied. During single-joint movements, phasic activity which preceded motion and varied in magnitude with interaction torque was observed in muscles acting at the stationary joint. During multi-joint movement EMG activity in muscles at one joint was modulated to offset interaction torque arising from limb motion about an adjacent joint. It is suggested that control signals to muscles are adjusted to offset interaction torques arising from limb dynamics. Schemes for incorporating information about dynamics into the position control framework proposed in the equilibrium point hypothesis are discussed...|$|R
40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 M ITC 2015 Liuxix, 204 pages :illustrations (some color); 30 cmAdolescent {{idiopathic}} scoliosis is {{a complex}} three-dimensional deformity of the spine, which appears and sometimes progresses during periods of rapid growth in apparently healthy adolescents with {{a higher proportion of}} girls than boys. In Hong Kong, {{it was found that the}} prevalence of scoliosis has an increasing trend. Postural alterations and imbalance problems are commonly found in these adolescents. However, there is a lack of product selection and treatment choice for adolescents with early scoliosis, and many problems are found with the existing products in the market. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide a tailor-made posture correction girdle for girls who are in the age group of 10 - 13 with early scoliosis, in order to improve their imbalanced postures by girdling and reduce the possibility of curvature progression in scoliosis. A systematic framework produced by using a three-stage design process, as well as the functional, expressive and aesthetic (FEA) consumer needs model are used during the design and development process of the girdle. A screening program has been carried out in 7 schools and 21. 9 % of the screened students possibly have early scoliosis. Nine are recruited in accordance with the inclusion criteria to participate in a 6 month wear trial. A posture correction girdle made of well-performing materials evaluated by physical tests is provided to each subject after two fitting sessions. Padding insertion is one of the key factors that contribute to posture correction by generating point-pressure forces in accordance with the needs in different cases. Acceptable compliance is found in the wear trial and no effects induced by girdling are found to influence heart and pulmonary functions, as well as the sensory levels according to the results of the health tests. Three dimensional body scanning, direct measuring of shoulder levelness by using the floor as a reference, and motion capturing are carried out to evaluate the possible effectiveness of the girdle on posture correction. The results of shoulder levelness measurement show that wearing the girdle with padding insertion have better effects than without wearing the girdle and wearing the girdle that without padding insertion in both of 0 and 3 months. The results of motion capturing show that the imbalanced postures of the subjects generally improve after 6 -months of girdling. Significant immediate improvements including more even <b>shoulder</b> in frontal <b>plane</b> and horizontal plane during standing, as well as straighter upper back in sagittal plane during sitting; while significant improvements from time-to-time including more even <b>shoulder</b> in frontal <b>plane</b> during standing and walking. Moreover, statistically significant differences of interaction effects of girdling (without girdle, with girdle) and time (0, 3, 6 months) on posture changes including more even shoulder an pelvis in frontal plane during standing, straighter lower back in sagittal plane during sitting, as well as acceptable constrained anterior and lateral bending range. As well, a radiographic analysis has been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the girdle on spinal deformity control. Regarding the results of radiographic analysis (Cobb{ 174 }s angle), 1 subject has improvement, 4 subjects were within control and 2 subjects have further curve progression after 6 months of girdling. Moreover, there are immediate improvements in the spinal curve of the subjects when comparisons are made between wearing a girdle and when a girdle is not worn, i. e. one of the subjects has 83. 33 % and 75 % reductions of the thoracic and lumbar curves respectively after she put on the girdle at 6 months. Additionally, for time-to-time improvements in the spinal curve of the subjects when comparisons are made between 0 month (pre) and 6 months (post) under condition of without girdle, one of the subjects has 26. 32 % and 20 % reductions of the thoracic and lumbar curves respectively. The progression rate could be due to factors such as compliance, growth and curve type which influenced the curve progression of the subjects in this study. To sum up, the posture correction girdle aims to provide a non-invasive method to control the body posture in order to reduce the possibility of progression of the spinal curve. Patience is needed to see improvement as training of posture needs time. The important thing is that treatment or training should be provided as soon as possible at the right time, i. e. puberty period, as it is more difficult to reverse poor posture or spinal curve deformity if it has already reached a certain level of severity. Although scoliosis is a multi-factorial deformity of the spine that sometimes results due to heredity, waiting to address the issue until it is too advanced is detrimental.

40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} campaign aimed at the study of the microstructure of Friction Stir Welded butt joints. In this solid-state welding technology, a rotating tool moves into the material and translates along the interface of two or more parts. During this process friction heats the material which is extruded around the tool and forged by the large pressure produced by the tool shoulder. The experimental campaign was performed by means of a CNC machine tool. Butt joints were obtained on sheets having a thickness equal to 8 mm. An AA 6060 aluminum alloy in the T 6 artificially aged condition was used for this purpose. Sheets were welded by using a standard tool with smooth <b>plane</b> <b>shoulder</b> and cylindrical pin. The tool was fabricated using AISI 1040 steel, shoulder and pin diameters are respectively equal to 20 and 8 mm. The tilt angle, was fixed at 2. 5 Â° and the pin was inserted into the workpiece for 7. 8 mm. The joints were executed by varying the process parameters, namely rotational speed (S [rev/min]) and feed rate (f [mm/min]). The selection of the parameter values was based on a DOE (Design of Experiments) approach. The metallurgical analysis was carried out to evaluate the microstructure of the joints transverse section {{as a function of the}} process parameters and to evaluate the grain size in the different regions of the joints: Nugget, HAZ - Heat Affected Zone, TMAZ - Thermo Mechanical Affected Zone. The grain count was executed according to the standard ASTM E 112 - 96 (2004). The ratio between feed rate and rotational speed resulted to be a significant parameter for the control of the joints grain size. The Nugget showed a microstructure with very small grains with an average dimension equal to one third with respect to the grains of the base material. The grain size linearly decreases for increasing values of the f/S ratio. The TMAZ is characterized by strongly elongated grains, oriented in a different way with respect to the ones of the other regions. Also in this case, an almost linear correlation between grain size and f/S ratio was observed. On the opposite, in the HAZ, the grain size decreases for increasing values of the f/S ratio. A tensile test campaign was also carried out to evaluate the mechanical properties of the joints. Specimens having a width and a thickness equal respectively to 18 mm and 8 mm were tested orthogonally with respect to the welding direction by means of a Galdabini machine. Except for the joints containing defects, the rupture always occurred in the HAZ. The increase of UTS was observed for increasing values of the ratio between feed rate and rotational speed (f/S). An inverse behaviour was observed for the strain at rupture. Finally, the quality of the joins, in terms of tensile strength, was compared with the metallurgical properties observed on the joints.

O propósito desse estudo foi de avaliar quantitativamente as alterações posturais, a mobilidade e a flexibilidade nos adolescentes federados no basquete. Participaram do estudo 74 adolescentes saudáveis, divididos em dois grupos, federados no basquete (GA) (n= 36) e grupo controle (GC) (n= 38). A análise postural foi realizada pela fotogrametria com o auxílio do software de avaliação postural (SAPO versão 0. 63 ® e de marcadores colocados nas referências ósseas. As variáveis posturais analisadas foram cabeça, ombro, escápula, coluna torácica e lombar, pelve, tronco e inclinação lateral da coluna.

As variáveis posturais do plano frontal (alinhamento dos ombros e postura da escápula esquerda) apresentaram influência da idade. O índice da assimetria horizontal da escápula teve influência da altura e a lordose lombar esquerda sofreu efeito da intensidade da dominância. Quanto à mobilidade o grupo atleta apresentou maior amplitude com significância estatística para os movimentos do ombro (flexão E, extensão D, adução D/E), cotovelo hiperextensão D e E) e punho (supinação E). Sugere-se que a postura e a mobilidade articular sofrem influência do treinamento de basquete, deste modo devem ser consideradas durante o treinamento esportivo de basquete para acompanhar o desenvolvimento dos adolescentes atletasAdolescents federated {{to basketball}} have an increasing demand for physical, technical, tactical and endurance training. At puberty, environmental and physical factors, associated with musculoskeletal structures immaturity may alter muscle strength, balance, mobility and joint flexibility, {{as well as}} influence the posture development. In an attempt to know and understand the consequences of sports training, studies have assessed the qualitative approach; however the means of assessing the posture statistics were not reliable or reproducible. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate quantitatively the postural changes, the mobility and the flexibility presented in adolescents federated tobasketball. The study included 74 healthy adolescents, divided into two groups: athletes federated to basketball (AG) (n = 36) and A control group (CG) (n = 38). The quantitative postural analysis was performed by photogrammetry measured using the Postural Assesment Software (PAS/SAPO) and markers previously placed on bone references. The postural variables analyzed were head, shoulder, scapula, thoracic and lumbar spne, pelvis, trunk and lateral inclination of the spine. Goniometry was performed to evaluate the mobility of the upper limbs and the testing of the 3 rd finger to the ground to assess flexibility. The data was analyzed by descriptive statistics (average, standard deviation) and Ancova to check the influence of the explanatory variables in the independent variables, by adopting the equal to 5 %. In the frontal plane, athletes had greater lateral inclination of the spine (AG = 5. 0 ° ± 2. 4 and CG = 3. 7 ° ± 1. 6) and in the right sagittal plane they had lower values for the head (AG = 51, 4 ° ± 5. 3 and CG = 48. 6 ° ± 5. 62), pelvic anteversion (AG = 11. 4 ° ± 5. 9 and CG = 14. 5 ° ± 5. 1), vertical alignment of the trunk (AG = - 0. 76 ° ± 2. 8 and CG = 0, 7 ° ± 2. 6) and thoracic kyphosis (AG = 27. 9 °± 7. 0 and CG = 32. 9 ° ± 7. 5). In the left sagittal plane the athletes had lower values for the anterior head (AG = 52. 5 °± 5. 7 and CG = 46. 4 ° ± 5. 6), protrusion of the shoulder (AG = 5. 9 cm ± 2. 2 and CG = 8. 3 cm ± 2. 1) and pelvic anteversion (AG = 10. 2 ° ± 6. 1 and CG = 14. 6 ° ± 4. 3). The variables in the postural frontal <b>plane</b> (<b>shoulder</b> alignment and posture of the left scapula) were influenced by age. The index of asymmetry of the horizontal scapula was influenced by the height and the left lumbar lordosis suffered the intensity of dominance. As for mobility, the athlete group showed higher amplitude with statistical significance for the movement of the shoulder (flexion L, extension R, adduction R / L), elbow (hyperextension R and L), and wrist (supination L). It is suggested that the posture and joint mobility are influenced by basketball training thus they should be considered during the basketball training in order to follow the development of young athlete...|$|R
