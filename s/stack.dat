40|$|Parallel and T-shaped <b>stacking</b> {{interactions}} of the peptide plane with polar and ionizable amino acid side chains (including aspartic/glutamic acid, asparagine/glutamine, and arginine) are investigated using the quantum mechanical MP 2 and CCSD computational methods.

For certain complexes, the dispersion interaction also contributes considerably to <b>stacking.</b> In the gas phase, the <b>stacking</b> interaction of the charged system is stronger than that of the neutral system, and T-shaped <b>stacking</b> is generally more preferred than parallel <b>stacking,</b> with the <b>stacking</b> energy in the range of 4 to - 18 kcal/mol.

40|$|Push–pull {{aromatics}} are {{not popular}} as optoelectronic materials because their supramolecular organization {{is difficult to}} control. However, recent progress with synthetic methods {{has suggested that the}} directional integration of push–pull components into multicomponent photosystems should become possible. In this study, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of double- or triple-channel architectures that contain π <b>stacks</b> with push–pull components in parallel or mixed orientation. Moreover, the parallel push–pull <b>stacks</b> were uniformly oriented with regard to co-axial <b>stacks,</b> either with inward or outward oriented push–pull dipoles. Hole-transporting (p) aminoperylenemonoimides (APIs) and aminonaphthalimides (ANIs) are explored for ordered push–pull <b>stacks.</b> For the co-axial electron-transporting (n) <b>stacks,</b> naphthalenediimides (NDIs) are used. In double-channel photosystems, mixed push–pull <b>stacks</b> are overall less active than parallel push–pull <b>stacks.</b> The orientation of the parallel push–pull <b>stacks</b> with regard to the co-axial NDI <b>stacks</b> has little influence on activity. In triple-channel photosystems, outward-directed dipoles in bridging <b>stacks</b> between peripheral p and central n channels show higher activity than inward-directed dipolar <b>stacks.</b> Higher activities in response to direct irradiation of outward-directed parallel <b>stacks</b> reveal the occurrence of quite remarkable optical gating...|$|R

25|$|Coaxial <b>stacking,</b> {{otherwise}} known as helical <b>stacking,</b> is {{a major determinant of}} higher order RNA tertiary structure. Coaxial <b>stacking</b> occurs when two RNA duplexes form a contiguous helix, which is stabilized by base <b>stacking</b> at the interface of the two helices. Coaxial <b>stacking</b> was noted in the crystal structure of tRNAPhe. More recently, coaxial <b>stacking</b> has been observed in higher order structures of many ribozymes, including many forms of the self-splicing group I and group II introns. Common coaxial <b>stacking</b> motifs include the kissing loop interaction and the pseudoknot. The stability of these interactions can be predicted by an adaptation of “Turner’s rules”.|$|R
