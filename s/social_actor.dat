More specifically, it explores (1) how the <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> are represented in the texts and (2) what the representations of <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> signify. Two folktales entitled The Ugly Duckling and The Little Matchgirlwritten by Hans C. Andersen were chosen as the data of this study. This study uses the theories of categorization of <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> (van Leeuwen, 2008) and transitivity (Halliday, 2004) as the bases of analysis. The findings show that all the <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> in the stories were mostly represented in inclusion, more specifically in Activation-Participation-Personalization. In addition, material process is mostly used in representing the <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> in the stories; consequently, actor {{is found to be}} the most frequent participant. Those results indicate that the <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> mostly actively participated in physical action and were treated as human beings. Finally, the study shows that representation can explore how the actors are constructed.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the way {{the workforce}} migration phenomenon is problematized by non-migrants, more specifically, <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> belonging to various socio-cultural categories, “witnesses” of this phenomenon and of debates in Romanian public space.

What meanings of collective identity are negotiated in a debate on workforce migration? This paper, based on Critical Discourse Analysis, first proves that <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> interpret this type of migration by instrumentalizing identitarian discourse: “categories” of migrants are instituted and symbolic inequalities are reproduced in the relationship with “the other”.

While corporations causing pollution mainly serve as barriers to civil society using the media effectively to highlight environmental injustices (e. g. through corporate media sponsorships, media intimidation), this is further complicated by limitations within civil society and media outlets to influence media discourse (e. g. limited financial/human resources, individualized leadership, media remuneration issues). Alongside these limitations, and the power of government and corporations, the influence of media discourse and perceptions regarding industrial risks are also dependent upon successful horizontal and vertical networking between civil society actors...|$|R

The role of <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> is conceptualized as a socio-political sensemaking process, a perspective that would complement the current structuralist bias in the discussion about the emergence of transnational social space in international management research literature...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE:To analyze {{suggestions}} that facilitate {{the use of}} organic foods produced by family farms made by the <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> responsible for Santa Catarina's school meals. METHODS:This qualitative and exploratory study used an electronic questionnaire for surveying 293 municipalities {{in the state of}} Santa Catarina in 2010 and identified the percentage of organic school foods purchased from family farms. The <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> from 52 municipalities who were responsible for organic food acquisition were interviewed in person. Their suggestions were categorized and analyzed by content analysis. RESULTS:A total of 446 <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> made 684 suggestions categorized into four themes: Awareness strategies for the use of organic foods (n= 286) were proposed by principals and dieticians, who emphasized the need of educating <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> and community and raising community awareness; Better Programa Nacional de Alimentação Escolarmanagement (n= 148) was suggested by principals and family farmers, who wanted less bureaucracy and outsourcing, fewer taxes, and more management involvement; Better coordination between the demand and supply of organic foods (n= 130) was suggested by principals, family farmers, and cooks because of logistic and supply problems; and Better management ofschool food production(n= 120) was suggested by principals and cooks, who reported problems with the supply of specific foods, low organic food diversity, and lack of certification. CONCLUSION:For the <b>social</b> <b>actors,</b> the use of organic foods in the schools of Santa Catarina requires the education of those involved (technical support, educational strategies, and community awareness), government support, coordination between demand and supply, and better management of organic food production...|$|R
