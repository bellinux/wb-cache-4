The following season, Liverpool reached the FA Cup Final, where they beat West Ham United, again on penalties after a 3–3 draw. Benítez again guided Liverpool to a Champions League Final in 2007, {{but this time}} A.C. Milan beat them 2–1. On 3 June 2010, Benitez paid the price for a disappointing 2009–10 season when Liverpool announced {{he had left the}} club by mutual consent after six years in charge. Benitez, who was one year into a five-year contract, finalised his departure after agreeing a <b>severance</b> <b>payment.</b> Benitez's assistant Sammy Lee took over the reins at Liverpool until Managing director Christian Purslow and former manager Kenny Dalglish found a replacement. On 1 July 2010, former Fulham boss Roy Hodgson was confirmed as the new manager. After a poor tenure, which included Liverpool being 18th after 6 games, and only one away win during Hodgson's time in charge, Hodgson was sacked on 8 January 2011 and was replaced by former manager Kenny Dalglish the day before a 3rd Round FA Cup game against Manchester United. Dalglish signed a three-year contract as permanent manager in May, but was sacked a year later. Although the 2011/12 season ended with a poor 8th-place finish in the Premier League, Dalglish guided Liverpool to two Cup finals at Wembley, ending a six-year trophy drought by winning the League Cup. The second Cup final appearance was the FA Cup, which Liverpool lost to Chelsea. He was replaced by Brendan Rodgers on 1 June 2012.|$|E

The practice {{had been going on}} for a number of years. Senior executives whose payments were criticised included: chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, who received a total of £680,400 on her departure in 2011; Deputy Director-General Mark Byford who also left the BBC in 2011, taking £949,000; CEO of BBC Worldwide John Smith who was paid a total of £1,031,000 in 2011 (he later returned £205,000); George Entwistle who left the Director-General job after only 54 days following the Savile crisis, and received a payment of £511,500; and Roly Keating, the Head of BBC Archives, who received a £375,000 <b>severance</b> <b>payment</b> in 2012 (which he later repaid in full). Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, criticised the practice, calling it an [...] "outrageous waste of licence fee payers' money." [...] Following his appointment as Director General, Lord Hall introduced a £150,000 cap on severance payments. Mark Thompson stated to the PAC that the payments had been fully approved by the BBC Trust.|$|E

Although <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> often are justified {{on the grounds that they}} provide insurance against earnings loss, they also increase costs for employers and distort employment decisions. The impact of <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> depends largely on how much of the costs to employers can be shifted to workers. The theoretical analysis in this Paper shows that, in contrast to a traditional system of <b>severance</b> <b>payments,</b> the system of SPSAs facilitates the shifting of <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> costs to workers in the form of lower wages. Empirical results using the Colombian National Household Surveys indicate that the introduction of SPSAs shifted around 80 % of the total <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> contributions to wages and had a positive effect on weekly hours. Results using the 1997 Colombian Living Standards Measurement Survey suggest that, although SPSAs in part replaced employer insurance with self-insurance, SPSAs continue to play a consumption smoothing role for the non-employed. consumption smoothing; crowding out; distortions; tax shifting; unemployment insurance...|$|R

2500|$|Remedies {{are often}} agreed in a {{contract}}, {{so that if}} one side fails to perform the contract will dictate what happens. A simple, common and automatic remedy is to have taken a deposit, and to retain it {{in the event of}} non-performance. However, the courts will often treat any deposit that exceeds 10 per cent of the contract price as excessive. A special justification will be required before any greater sum may be retained as a deposit. The courts will view a large deposit, even if expressed in crystal clear language, as a part payment of the contract which if unperformed must be restored in order to prevent unjust enrichment. Nevertheless, where commercial parties of equal bargaining power wish to insist on circumstances in which a deposit will be forfeit and insist precisely on the letter of their deal, the courts will not interfere. In Union Eagle Ltd v Golden Achievement Ltd a purchaser of a building in Hong Kong for HK$4.2million had a contract stipulating completion must take place by 5pm on 30 September 1991 and that if not a 10 per cent deposit would be forfeited and the contract rescinded. The purchaser was 10 minutes late only, but the Privy Council advised that given the necessity of certain rules and to remove business' fear of courts exercising unpredictable discretion, the agreement would be strictly enforced. Agreements may also state that, as opposed to a sum fixed by the courts, a particular sum of [...] "liquidated damages" [...] will be paid upon non-performance. The courts place an outer-limit on liquidated damages clauses if they became so high, or [...] "extravagant and unconscionable" [...] as to look like a penalty. Penalty clauses in contracts are generally not enforceable. [...] However this jurisdiction is exercised rarely, so in Murray v Leisureplay plc the Court of Appeal held that a <b>severance</b> <b>payment</b> of a whole year's salary to a company's Chief Executive in the event of dismissal before a year was not a penalty clause. Additionally, the ability of courts to strike down clauses as penalties only applies to clauses for payment of money upon the breach of the contract rather than events during its performance, though the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 confers jurisdiction to interfere with unfair terms used against consumers.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{equilibrium}} welfare effects of introducing mandated <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> in a labor market with costly mobility, where self-insurance through a riskless asset {{is the only}} way to smooth fluctuations in labor income due to unemployment shocks. The framework allows for wage flexibility at the level of the individual firm-worker match. Wages vary with both tenure and productivity of the workers. When <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> are introduced, the firm can potentially undo their effect by modifying the wage profile. Workers entry wages fall by the expected present value of the future payment. However, because of incomplete markets, workers are affected by the change in slope of the wage profile. Moreover, non trivial general equilibrium effects are also present, since the incentives to save are affected and the capital stock varies. On the one hand, with <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> agents are better insured and the precautionary motive for savings is reduced. On the other hand, the change in the wage profile is likely to reduce the savings of young individuals and increase that of older ones.

40|$|Suppose {{that a fair}} {{insurance}} policy is available to risk-averse economic agents contingent on only "observable" variables. The risk-averse agents will purchase incomplete insurance to maximize their expected utility. The first order condition is typically an equality of expected "marginal" utility. whether or not weighted by the level of income, conditional on observable states. It is interesting {{to know how the}} "levels" of utility are ranked among these states given the first order conditions. We will show that the ranking of the "level" of expected utility depends on the degree of risk aversion. Suppose an implicit contract model with <b>severance</b> <b>payments.</b> Workers are laid off with a fixed known probability. When a worker is laid off, he is paid <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> and released for a search of new employment. Whether he is reemployed or self-employed or how much he is earning is unverifiable by the original employer, so that <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> cannot be contingent on income after layoff. In this sense, <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> are incomplete insurance. Suppose that income after layoff is proportional to <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> with the proportion being stochastic. The first order condition is given as an equality of an expected marginal utility of income after layoff weighted by that income to a marginal utility of wages for a retained worker weighted by the amount of <b>severance</b> <b>payments.</b> For example, when the relative risk aversion is more than one and constant, and the mean of proportion of yield on <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> is less than one, the utility of the retained is larger than the expected utility of the laid off. Other cases are worked out, too. This claim is proved using the following theorem. Provided that the relative risk aversion is greater than one, the "level" of utility of sure income is greater (less) than the expected utility, if the utility function is of increasing (decreasing, respectively) relative risk aversion. The result is reverse for the case that the degree of risk aversion is less than one. All assertions are rigorously proved...|$|R
