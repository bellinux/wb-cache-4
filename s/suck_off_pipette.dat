30|$|Figure  23 (b) {{shows the}} flow {{model of the}} cascade with single-slot endwall suction. Only the suction slot near the middle pitchwise of the passage is presented. The HS of the leading edge {{horseshoe}} vortex moves under the endwall cross-passage pressure gradient and intersects with the suction surface soon, {{which is the same}} with baseline cascade. Compared with baseline cascade, HP is <b>sucked</b> <b>off</b> by the endwall suction slot and does not migrate to the suction surface/endwall corner. The major difference between single-slot endwall suction and baseline cascade is the double passage vortexes system. The classical passage vortex is divided into two smaller passage vortexes with single-slot endwall suction. The low-momentum fluid between pressure surface and suction slot migrates toward the suction slot under the cross-passage static pressure gradient, resulting in the formation of PVP. The endwall cross-passage flows between suction slot and suction surface reform, which forms the PVS. As PVP and PVS flow downstream, they combine into a single-passage vortex near the trailing edge section of the cascade. As the majority of the low energy fluid on the endwall is <b>sucked</b> <b>off,</b> and the cross-passage pressure gradient is reduced, the passage vortex dissipates more quickly while flowing downstream.|$|R

50|$|Ghillies, or ghillie brogues, are {{a modern}} {{development}} of the brogue used by highlanders. They were made with hide punctured with holes to let water out (as well as in) and this helped feet and footwear to dry out more quickly in the wet/damp/ boggy conditions. These shoes are laced through leather tangs {{and do not have}} the tongue which covers the bridge of the foot in normal shoes. The high lacing helped prevent the shoe from being <b>sucked</b> <b>off</b> by mud. Though the ghillie brogue is now considered the normal style of Scottish dress footwear, most of the population probably more often wore the modern brogue with tongue and laces (known in the States as 'wingtips').|$|R

40|$|The use of suction as a boundary-layer-control {{method for}} {{inhibiting}} flow separation {{is well known}} in aerodynamics. Its application to conduit flows and, in particular, diffuser and sudden expansion flows has not been as well developed. The present paper thus presents a welcome and valuable addition to our knowledge of such flows. As in other boundary-layer-control uses for separation prevention the two principal questions are, firstly, how much (actually how little) suction flow is needed to produce an appreciable gain in performance and, secondly, is this application practical. Answers to both these questions are furnished b y this study. Thus for the first, the author's results show that one need only <b>suck</b> <b>off</b> a few percent (2 to 6 percent) of the total flow to achieve a major gain in performance. N o w to the second question, the answer seems to be negative, when comparison is made with the conical diffuser. This answer i...|$|R
40|$|The author {{develops}} {{a new theory}} of tornado stability. He show {{that it is the}} high electric voltage between clouds and ground surface which produces the intensive electron/ion flow which creates the air stream which <b>sucks</b> <b>off</b> (pumping) air from the inside tornado channel and makes the tornado stable. If we want to destroy tornado stability we must decrease the electric intensity into the tornado channel. The simplest method is using conductive wire to connect the top funnel of tornado with ground. For this method, the top end of wire must have a large conductive area (air balloon or wing dirigible with conductive layer), the lower end of wire must have good contact with wet ground. The row from these conductive wires having step 150 – 200 m and altitude 200 – 300 m can protect villages, towns and important installations such as the nuclear electric station and military bases from tornados...|$|R
