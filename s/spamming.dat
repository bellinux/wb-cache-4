Comments are submitted on the Techniques website and as many Slivers that will fit appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of <b>spamming</b> of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill empty room left between advertisements {{in order to maintain}} a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the Sliver Box. Slivers were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes ("Slivers") at the bottom of each page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the Sliver Box.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spamming</b> on online social {{networks}} is quite prevalent. A primary motivation to spam {{arises from the}} fact that a user advertising a brand would like others to see them and they typically publicize their brand over the social network. Detecting such <b>spamming</b> activity has been well studied by developing a semi-automated model to detect spams. For instance, text mining techniques are leveraged to detect regular activity of <b>spamming</b> which reduces the viewership and brings down the reputation (or credibility) of a public pages maintained over Facebook. In some online {{social networks}} like Twitter, users have evolved mechanisms to report spammers which has been studied and analyzed.|$|E

25|$|Within a few years, {{the focus}} of <b>spamming</b> (and {{anti-spam}} efforts) moved chiefly to email, where it remains today. Arguably, the aggressive email <b>spamming</b> {{by a number of}} high-profile spammers such as Sanford Wallace of Cyber Promotions in the mid-to-late 1990s contributed to making spam predominantly an email phenomenon in the public mind. By 1999, Khan C. Smith, a well known hacker at the time, had begun to commercialize the bulk email industry and rallied thousands into the business by building more friendly bulk email software and providing internet access illegally hacked from major ISPs such as Earthlink and Botnets.|$|E

40|$|Just as email <b>spam</b> has {{negatively}} impacted {{the user}} messaging experience, {{the rise of}} Web <b>spam</b> is threatening to severely degrade the quality {{of information on the}} World Wide Web. Fundamentally, Web <b>spam</b> is designed to pollute search engines and corrupt the user experience by driving traffic to particular <b>spammed</b> Web pages, regardless of the merits of those pages. In this paper, we identify an interesting link between email <b>spam</b> and Web <b>spam,</b> and we use this link to propose a novel technique for extracting large Web <b>spam</b> samples from the Web.

The corpus consists of nearly 350, 000 Web <b>spam</b> pages, making it more than two orders of magnitude larger than any other previously cited Web <b>spam</b> data set. Finally, we identify several application areas where the Webb <b>Spam</b> Corpus may be especially helpful.

25|$|The Spamhaus Register of Known Spam Operations (ROKSO) is a {{database}} of spammers and spam operations who have been terminated from three or more ISPs due to <b>spamming.</b> It contains publicly sourced information about these persons, their domains, addresses and aliases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spamming</b> remains {{economically}} viable because advertisers have no operating costs beyond {{the management of}} their mailing lists, servers, infrastructures, IP ranges, and domain names, {{and it is difficult}} to hold senders accountable for their mass mailings. Because the barrier to entry is so low, spammers are numerous, and the volume of unsolicited mail has become very high. In the year 2011, the estimated figure for spam messages is around seven trillion. The costs, such as lost productivity and fraud, are borne by the public and by Internet service providers, which have been forced to add extra capacity to cope with the deluge. <b>Spamming</b> has been the subject of legislation in many jurisdictions.|$|E
40|$|More than 70 % {{of global}} e-mail traffic {{consists}} of unsolicited and commercial direct marketing, {{also known as}} <b>spam.</b> Dealing with <b>spam</b> incurs high costs for organizations, prompting efforts to try to reduce spam-related costs by installing <b>spam</b> filters. Using modern econometric methods to reduce the selection bias of installing a <b>spam</b> filter, we deploy a unique data setting implemented at a German university to measure {{the costs associated with}} <b>spam</b> and the costs savings of <b>spam</b> filters. The applied methodological framework can easily be transferred to estimate the effect of other IS technologies (e. g., SAP) implemented in organizations. Our findings indicate that central IT costs are of little relevance since the majority of <b>spam</b> costs stem from employees who spend working time identifying and deleting <b>spam.</b> The working time losses caused by <b>spam</b> are approximately 1, 200 minutes per employee per year; these costs could be reduced by roughly 35 % through the installation of a <b>spam</b> filter mechanism.

40|$|<b>Spam</b> {{messages}} muddle up users inbox, consume network resources, {{and build}} up DDoS attacks, spread malware. Our goal is to present a definite figure about the characteristics of <b>spam</b> and <b>spam</b> vulnerable email accounts. These evaluations help us to enhance the existing technology to combat <b>spam</b> effectively. We collected 400 thousand <b>spam</b> mails from a <b>spam</b> trap {{set up in a}} corporate mail server for a period of 14 months form January 2006 to February 2007. Spammers use common techniques to <b>spam</b> end users regardless of corporate server and public mail server. So we believe that our <b>spam</b> collection is a sample of world wide <b>spam</b> traffic. Studying the characteristics of this sample helps us to better understand the features of <b>spam</b> and <b>spam</b> vulnerable e-mail accounts. We believe that this analysis is highly useful to develop more efficient anti <b>spam</b> techniques. In our analysis we classified <b>spam</b> based on attachment and contents. According to our study the four years old heavy users email accounts attract more <b>spam</b> than four years old light users mail accounts. The 14 months old relatively new email accounts don’t receive <b>spam.</b> In some special cases like DDoS attacks, the new email accounts receive <b>spam.</b> During DDoS attack 14 months old heavy users email accounts have attracted more number of <b>spam</b> than 14 months old light users mail accounts...|$|R
40|$|As the <b>spam</b> problem grew larger, the {{interest}} in <b>spam</b> filters grew accordingly. As with any new technology, new terms were introduced that are used frequently in this research work {{that needs to be}} explained. We refer to email that is not <b>spam</b> as ham. <b>Spam</b> will cost the spammer very little to send since most of the cost is absorbed by the recipients or by the carriers. Furthermore, sorting out the unwanted messages takes time and introduces a risk of deleting normal email by mistake. Most of them are responsible in eliminating such emails from the recipients’ mailbox. Regarding to this problem it seems necessary for us to have a good <b>spam</b> filtering system, which is able to classify the incoming emails into the mailbox whether it is legitimate or <b>spam</b> email. The reduction of dimensionality by selecting new attributes which is subset of old attributes is known as feature selection. In this paper we not only filter <b>spam</b> but also categorize <b>spam.</b> And remove <b>spam</b> word or contents from <b>spam</b> mail. And regenerate that massage and saved as no <b>spam</b> massage. Blacklists stop known spammers eliminate <b>spam</b> sent by spam-bots, decoy email boxes alert to new <b>spam</b> attacks, and Bayesian filters detect <b>spam</b> and virus attack emails right from the start, even before the blacklist is updated. along with the bouncing emails created by viruses.

Fast <b>spam</b> detection allows prioritizing e-mail servicing at receiving e-mail servers to safeguard non-spam e-mail deliveries even under heavy <b>spam</b> traffic. Fast <b>spam</b> detection also allows <b>spam</b> rejection during Simple Mail Transfer Protocol sessions for inbound and outbound <b>spam</b> control.

50|$|Image <b>spam</b> {{started in}} 2004 and peaked {{at the end}} of 2006, when over 50% of <b>spam</b> was image <b>spam.</b> In the middle of 2007, it started declining, and {{practically}} disappeared in 2008.However, the reason behind this phenomenon is not easy to understand. The decline of image <b>spam</b> can probably be attributed both to the improvement of the proposed countermeasures (e.g., fast image <b>spam</b> detectors based on visual features), and to the higher requirements in terms of bandwidth of image <b>spam</b> that force spammers to send a smaller amount of <b>spam</b> over a given time interval. Both factors might have made image <b>spam</b> less convenient for spammers than other kinds of spam.Nevertheless, at the end 2011 a rebirth of image <b>spam</b> was detected, and image <b>spam</b> reached 8% of all <b>spam</b> traffic, albeit for a small period.|$|R
