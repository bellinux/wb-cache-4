25|$|The W.2B/23C engines {{upon which}} the Welland was based {{produced}} 1,700lbf (7.58kN) of thrust each, giving the aircraft a maximum speed of 417mph (670km/h) at 3,000m {{and a range of}} 1,006miles (1,610km). It incorporated a hydraulically driven engine starter developed by Rolls-Royce, which was automated following the press of a <b>starter</b> <b>button</b> in the cockpit. The engines also drove hydraulic and vacuum pumps as well as a generator via a Rotol gearbox fixed on the forward wing spar; the cockpit was also heated by bleed air from one of the engines. The acceleration rate of the engines was manually controlled by the pilot; rapid engine acceleration would frequently induce compressor stalls early on; the likelihood of compressor stalls was effectively eliminated upon further design refinements of both the Welland engine and the Meteor itself. At high speeds, the Meteor had a tendency to lose directional stability, often during unfavourable weather conditions, leading to a 'snaking' motion; this could be easily resolved by throttling back to reduce speed.|$|E
2500|$|The Robin ATL (Avion Très Léger, [...] "very light {{aircraft}}") is a French two-seat {{light aircraft}} designed by Avions Robin in the 1980s {{to meet a}} need for an economical two-seat aircraft to equip flying clubs. It is a single-engined monoplane with a fixed tricycle undercarriage, conventional control stick, and is, unusually, fitted with a V-tail. Due to the large bubble canopy, visibility is [...] excellent. Its benign flight characteristics, moderate speeds and low fuel consumption, {{as well as some}} unique details, like an engine <b>starter</b> <b>button</b> which can only be pressed when the fuel selector switch is open, made the ATL a good trainer.|$|E
2500|$|Both the Roadster and Roadster Coupé are {{available}} in Brabus-tuned versions with power increased to [...] The Brabus versions have a different twin sports exhaust, lower suspension, polished six-spoke aluminum alloy Monoblock VI 17" [...] wheels (205/40 ZR17 at the front and 225/35 ZR17 at the rear), front spoiler, side skirts and radiator grille. Exclusive Brabus (Xclusive) interior includes leather trimmed dashboard, alloy-effect accent parts, instrument graphics, leather/aluminium gearknob with Brabus labelled <b>starter</b> <b>button,</b> aluminium handbrake handle (which fouls the central armrest), aluminium pedals and Brabus labeled floor mats. The Brabus version also features stronger clamping of the clutch plates and a faster gearchange. The Monoblock wheels {{are known to be}} very soft and as a result are very easy to buckle. The lacquer on these wheels is also very poor, and corrosion can occur very early {{in the life of the}} wheel.|$|E
50|$|Piaggio also {{produced}} some stablemates to the Ciao: The Piaggio Si, with a telescopic front fork suspension, the Piaggio Grillo, with 14-inch wheel, Piaggio Boxer, the Si's ancestor, the Piaggio Boss, with kick <b>starter,</b> mass <b>button</b> and speedometer and the Piaggio Bravo with a telescopic front fork and a shock absorber rear suspension.|$|R
50|$|A {{combination}} {{steering lock}} and ignition key was fitted to the steering column, which replaced the dashboard mounted ignition switch and charismatic push <b>button</b> <b>starter.</b> A new steering column was {{fitted with a}} collapsible section {{in the event of}} an accident.|$|R
5000|$|A single sawyer using a single-cylinder, single-motor {{power saw}} makes three {{vertical}} cuts—down, up and down—through a 20 in white pine log. This one-man contest is strictly against time. Chain saws may be warmed up {{prior to the}} contest, but must be turned off before the contest begins. Neither self-starting nor impulse-type push <b>button</b> <b>starters</b> nor twin motors are allowed.

Dave Bolstad of New Zealand holds the world record {{with a time of}} 5.55 seconds set in 2007.|$|R
2500|$|The 1949 {{model was}} {{equipped}} with an ignition key and a starter push-button to engage the starter. Pushing the <b>starter</b> <b>button</b> would engage the starter, but if the ignition key was not inserted, unlocking the ignition, the car would not start. The car {{was equipped with}} an oil bath air cleaner. At the bottom edge of the front fender directly behind the front wheel was a badge that said [...] "Futuramic" [...] which identified an Oldsmobile approach to simplified driving, {{and the presence of}} an automatic transmission. [...] Styling changes for the 1950 model include the replacement of a two-piece windshield with a one-piece unit and the addition of the Holiday hardtop coupe to the line. Also a three-speed manual transmission with column shift became available as a [...] "delete for credit" [...] option to the Hydra-Matic automatic transmission. The 88 now outsold the six-cylinder 76 lineup, which was dropped entirely after the 1950 model year. It had a 40ft. turning circle. [...] The 1950 model won the 1950 Carrera Panamericana.|$|E
2500|$|The Skycar I {{was first}} {{displayed}} at the spring 1931 Detroit Show. The aircraft was a two-seat high-wing monoplane, accommodating the occupants in tandem layout. It had an all-metal steel-tube frame covered with corrugated metal skin. Centre-line nose and tail-wheels plus a standard landing gear were fitted. The rear fuselage was constructed from an open framework carrying a single fin and rudder, inside which was located the rear pusher engine. The Sky Car was displayed with a Moorhouse engine (Alfred Moorhouse of Detroit, assignor to Packard Motor Car Company). Fuel was carried in two tanks in the leading portion of the central section of the engine housing, from where it was fed by gravity to the engine. At a later date the aircraft was fitted with twin booms carrying the single fin and rudder (see photo of preserved aircraft). The aircraft featured balanced pivoting outboard wingtips rather than ailerons. Stout attempted to design a simple aircraft that would have controls similar to early model Fords including the ignition switch and the <b>starter</b> <b>button.</b> Stout planned to build the Sky Car (i.e. its original name was [...] "Sky Car" [...] but various newspaper and magazine articles spelled it [...] "Skycar") [...] and sell it {{at the price of}} a moderately priced car (approximately $2000) if mass-produced in numbers.|$|E
50|$|The Z9 {{has only}} a <b>starter</b> <b>button</b> and light switch on the dashboard. An {{electronic}} key is used to activate the driver's controls. Then, a simple <b>starter</b> <b>button</b> starts the engine. The instrument panel folds out when prompted. Classic, circular dials provide feedback to the driver.|$|E

50|$|In 2008 (for the 2009 model year) RAV4 {{was given}} a {{mid-cycle}} refresh in some markets, featuring a number of changes, including an all-new 4-cylinder engine, and a redesigned front end and tweaked rear end. The Limited model gets a different front grille and bumper cover from other models. The Sport model features a bigger spoiler and red badging along with an option on the V6 model to have a rear door without the externally mounted spare tire (run-flat tires are used on this model). New features/options include turn signals integrated into the side mirrors, backup camera (with monitor built into rear-view mirror), satellite navigation, smart keyless entry, a push <b>button</b> <b>starter,</b> a multi-function instrument cluster display, etc. Much of the interior remains the same. In 2009, {{it was also the}} first time for the Canadian market to have a 2WD model sold in Canada.|$|R
5000|$|With {{security}} {{after the}} September 11 {{attacks on the}} US becoming prevalent, causing issues with starting pistols, a trend developed to use electronic starting systems that do not use pistols, but use a [...] "dummy" [...] prop pistol which cannot function as a firearm that is wired to the timing system. When the <b>starter</b> presses the <b>button,</b> they emit a signal to play a simulated gunshot that is broadcast to loudspeakers behind each lane, show a flash, emit simulated smoke, and start the timing clock. Many venues have switched to the new format. Beyond the security concerns, {{it has also been}} observed that even with the use of loudspeakers, some competitors still wait for the actual sound of the gun to reach them, and since the new all-electronic starting pistols have no such problems, they became the official way of starting games at the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|R
5000|$|In 1998, the 2.0 litre five {{cylinder}} 20V got a Variable Inlet System, {{which brought}} {{the power to}} [...] The 2.0 litre five cylinder 20V Turbo received a six speed gearbox and a large, satin gloss push <b>starter</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
50|$|Vehicles with a smart-key {{system can}} {{disengage}} the immobiliser and activate the ignition without inserting a {{key in the}} ignition, provided the driver has the key inside the car. On most vehicles, this is done by pressing a <b>starter</b> <b>button</b> or twisting an ignition switch.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrical}} system was {{powered by a}} 12 volt, lightweight, aircraft battery, which had a master battery control. It powered a starter solenoid via <b>starter</b> <b>button</b> and switches, {{as well as an}} array of instruments, including tachometer (0-10,000 rpm), oil pressure, water temperature, and oil temperature.|$|E
50|$|Reverse gear {{of a sort}} {{was offered}} on later models, but using this {{involved}} stopping the engine and starting it backwards. This was achieved by reversing the Siba Dynastart unit, a device which doubled as both starter and generator. It operated as a starter motor when the <b>starter</b> <b>button</b> was pressed but when the engine was running it generated power instead and recharged the battery.|$|E
5000|$|The first post-war Plymouth, a P15S De Luxe, {{came off}} the line October 22, 1945. Special De Luxes would follow four days later. Bodies for the P15 Plymouths were {{virtually}} unchanged from 1942, with only minor trim differences. “Engineering magic greets you right from the start. You don’t grope for a <b>starter</b> <b>button</b> or pedal. You don’t pull on a choke. You simply turn the ignition key- and the engine starts.” ...|$|E
50|$|The {{completed}} chassis {{and engine}} were then {{shipped to the}} Maserati restoration experts at Steve Hart Racing in England. In completing the restoration, the restoration facility added additional original Birdcage parts including rear lights, repeater lights, rev counter, ignition switch (also known as the light switch), <b>starter</b> <b>button,</b> indicator switch (also known as turn signal), and front hubs. This information is verified in a letter written and signed by the restoration facility owner.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to new controls for D-Mode and cruise control, several controls are different. There's a new rocker {{on the left}} hand grip that controls the heated grips and which page is displayed on the information panel; which function the rocker provides is controlled by a trigger switch near the left forefinger. The stop/run rocker is now stop/run/start with the last position being momentary; the hazard flasher button is where the <b>starter</b> <b>button</b> was previously located. A similar rocker switch for headlight control provides high/low/flash controls.|$|E
5000|$|The cotton-reel adaptor {{fills the}} gap between the V6 {{flexplate}} and starter motor and adapts straight to sprintcar driveshaft uni-joint. Every other component on the cars are modern sprintcar parts. With the Holden V6 adapter, the driver simply locks the quick-change diff into gear, then flicks an ignition [...] "on" [...] switch and holds down their <b>starter</b> <b>button.</b> The car will then engage the starter motor turning the engine crank and driveline projecting the car forwards, once the cars has cranked to enough speed the engine will fire and the car will be in gear ready to race.|$|E

5000|$|On January 16, 1934 Bremer {{was kidnapped}} {{from the streets}} of St. Paul, Minnesota. He {{was on his way to}} work, having just dropped his {{daughter}} off at school when he was approached by two men, one of whom was Arthur [...] "Doc" [...] Barker. Barker repeatedly punched and pistol-whipped him, forcing him into the back of the car and placing blindfolding goggles over his eyes. After having some difficulty starting the vehicle, the kidnappers forced the bleeding Bremer to show them the <b>starter</b> <b>button,</b> then drove off, later switching to another car. The blood-stained vehicle was later recovered, leading to fears that Bremer had been killed.|$|E
50|$|The 2008 Fiesta {{includes}} Ford's Convers+ menu system, as {{seen on the}} Mondeo, S-MAX and Galaxy, and {{complemented by}} steering wheel button controls. Ford initially anticipated that over 85% of Fiesta orders would include this multifunction display. Other new equipment includes keyless entry with a 'Ford Power' <b>starter</b> <b>button,</b> reach and rake adjustable steering wheel, electric power steering, and a USB port for portable music players. Ford Easyfuel, the capless refuelling system recently introduced with the Ford Mondeo, {{will also be a}} feature, while 'ambient lighting,' casting a soft red glow over the interior, will be an option. For the 2011 US market model, the Ford Sync in-car communications and entertainment system will be available as an option.|$|E
50|$|Optional extras were a luggage rack, chrome bumpers and Stevenson Jacking system. The {{upholstery}} was {{leather cloth}} with leather seating. The only known Super 9 to have Bedford Cord throughout is the prototype; this {{also has a}} smokers vent in the roof which is shown on brochures, but is not seen on any production 9’s. Instruments consisted of a speedometer, clock, oil gauge and ammeter. After 1931 a petrol gauge was added, prior to this a fuel tap was incorporated to give a reserve supply. Dash switches consisted of, a dash light, interior light, ignition, and a <b>starter</b> <b>button,</b> also choke and fast running control. External lights switching, battery charge rate, and ignition timing were all at {{the centre of the}} steering wheel.|$|E
50|$|The Focus RS was {{available}} in one metallic colour, Imperial Blue. The body looked similar to the standard Focus or to the ST170, although the RS featured unique front and rear bumper assemblies required for the wider wheel arches which accommodated the 65 mm wider front track. Internally, the theme is blue and black with sections of blue leather trim on the door trim panels, {{the steering wheel and}} the Sparco seats which were trimmed in blue/black leather and Alcantara. A green <b>starter</b> <b>button</b> starts the engine. The instruments have a blue background and in place of the coolant temperature gauge, the RS was equipped with a boost pressure indicator (up to 1.5 bar). The gear lever knob, handbrake lever, and pedals were all custom made by Sparco.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1952 the Mercedes-Benz 170 Sb {{replaced}} the 170 S model. The car now received a works {{number of its}} own, becoming known internally as the “Mercedes-Benz W 191”. Both cabriolet versions had been withdrawn in November 1951, cabriolet buyers now being catered for by the cabriolet versions of the 6-cylinder Mercedes-Benz W187 220 model. The 170 Sb was therefore available only with a four-door sedan/saloon body. Other changes included in the 1952 upgrade included {{the replacement of the}} floor-mounted gear lever with a then fashionable column mounted gear lever. There was now a <b>starter</b> <b>button</b> on the dashboard and the heater was improved. Under the bonnet/hood the camshaft was now driven via a chain rather than via gear cogs, a hypoid differential was fitted and the rear track was increased by 15 mm.|$|E

5000|$|The 1941 Clipper was {{the widest}} {{production}} {{car in the}} industry and first to be wider than it was tall—a foot wider to be exact. The body from cowl to deck was {{a single piece of}} steel—largest in the industry, and the floor pan had only one welded seam from end to end. Single pieces of sheet metal comprised the rear quarters and hood. The hood could be lifted from either side of the car or removed entirely by throwing two levers. Instead of the traditional third side window, ventipanes were incorporated in the rear doors, providing controllable flow-through ventilation. The battery made its first move from under the seat to under the hood, where it stayed warmer and was more accessible. There was a [...] "Ventalarm" [...] whistle to warn when the tank was within a gallon of being full, and an accelerator-activated <b>starter</b> <b>button,</b> so the act of starting simultaneously set the automatic choke.
