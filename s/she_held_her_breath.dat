60|$|Marguerite {{could not}} see the door; <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> trying to imagine what was happening.|$|E
60|$|The night {{suddenly}} seemed full of movement. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> Things were passing--one, two, three--subtly sneaking shadows.... Jackals.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> She {{recognized}} the voice. She {{had not seen}} him fall. Was he pursuing her there dead, or perhaps [...] . alive? ...|$|E
60|$|That {{was one of}} Grizel's {{beautiful}} days, {{but there}} were others to follow as sweet, if not so exciting; she could travel back through the long length of them without coming once to a moment when <b>she</b> had <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> in sudden fear; and this was so delicious that she sometimes thought these were the best days of all.|$|R
60|$|The {{report was}} {{followed}} by a yell, and the Indian in the bow dropped his paddle and fell back. At other times, at so short a distance, she would not have missed her aim at the centre of his chest by a finger's breadth; but though <b>she</b> had <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> in order to steady her rifle, her arms were quivering from her exertions, and she had only hit him on his right shoulder, the red mark on the brown skin showing where he was struck. A moment later she was again on her way. The fall of the man against the red-skin behind him had nearly upset the Indian canoe, and she had gained several lengths before the pursuit was continued. She looked round, and saw that the wounded man was again kneeling in his place. His paddle had fallen overboard when he was struck, and even had it not been so, he could have rendered but slight assistance to his comrades with but one hand available.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} {{a pleasant}} warmth was creeping through her wearied body {{and she began}} to wonder with a sense of compunction how many blankets Thorne possessed, and where he was. It was at least certain that he was nowhere near the fire, for she had carefully satisfied herself on that point. Then a wild, drawn-out howl drifted up to her across the faintly gleaming prairie and <b>she</b> started and <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> until <b>she</b> remembered that Thorne had said there was no reason why she should be alarmed if she heard a coyote. He was, she felt, a man one could believe. The beast did not howl again, but she continued to think of her companion as her eyes grew heavy. There was no doubt that he had a pleasant voice and a handsome face. Then her eyes closed altogether and her yielding elbow slipped down among the hay.|$|R
60|$|Then she {{wondered}} if her own numbness and despair meant death, and <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> to think harder upon it. She concluded at last, grimly, that she didn't care--only for the children.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> to listen--not at all frightened, for {{the sound}} of those footsteps, the {{presence}} of that human creature close by, were in tune with her mood of expectancy of something that was foredoomed to come.|$|E
60|$|Holster {{approached}} him, menacingly, {{until the}} two men stood almost touching, {{and for a moment}} it seemed to Janet as if the agent of the Clarendon were ready to strike Ditmar. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> her blood ran faster,--the conflict between these two made an elemental appeal.|$|E
5000|$|Kristen's Water cell stunt {{requires}} her to hold <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> {{while she}} picks {{a series of}} locks that fasten chains and secure {{the lid of the}} cell. She averages 2 minutes and 48 seconds underwater on one breath, however she has occasionally taken up to 3 minutes and 18 seconds to free herself. The longest time <b>she</b> has ever <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> is 5 minutes and 2 seconds. She ends her shows with this escape and has performed it as often as 30 times in ten days. She offers a $10,000 challenge to anyone who can prove that she takes a second breath, uses an underwater breathing apparatus or a key once she has dropped below the water. As of June 25, 2013 Kristen has attempted the water torture cell 1057 times to date. Escapologist and convention organizer Mark Cannon has stated that this escape [...] "is fast becoming one of the most talked-about stunts in the world of escapology". And Wayne N. Kawamoto from About: magic has written: [...] "Her escape was the most dramatic and involving that I have ever witnessed. Johnson set a high bar for the other performers that will be difficult to match." ...|$|R
6000|$|And verily {{the strange}} sense of rapture and enchantment {{was no less}} in the mother herself. There is no charm perhaps {{equal to that of}} a {{primrose}} bank on a sunny day in spring, sight, sound, scent all alike exquisite. It comes with a new and fresh delight even to those to whom this is an annual experience, and to those who never saw the like before it gives, like the first sight of the sea or of a snowy mountain, a sensation never to be forgotten. Fret, fatigue, anxiety, sorrow all passed away like dreams in that sweet atmosphere. Carey, like one of her children, absolutely forgot everything in the charm and wonder of the scene, in the pure, delicate unimaginable odour of the primroses, in debating with Allen whether (cockneys that they were) it could be a nightingale [...] "singing by day when every goose is cackling," [...] in listening to the marvellous note, only pausing to be answered from further depths, in the beauty of the whole, and in the individual charm of every flower, each heavily-laden arch of dark blue-bells with their curling tips, so infinitely more graceful than their pampered sister, the hyacinth of the window-glass, of each pure delicate anemone she gathered, with its winged stem, of the smiling primrose of that inimitable tint it only wears in its own woodland nest; and when Allen lighted on a bed of wood-sorrel, with its scarlet stems, lovely trefoil leaves, and purple striped blossoms like insect's wings, <b>she</b> absolutely <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> in an enthusiasm of reverent admiration. No one can tell the happiness of those four, only slightly diminished by Armine's getting bogged {{on his way to the}} golden river of king-cups, and his mother in going after him, till Allen from an adjacent stump pulled them out, their feet deeply laden with mud.|$|R
6000|$|Midas the king, as in {{his book}} appears, [...] By Phoebus was endow'd with ass's ears, [...] Which under his long locks he well conceal'd, [...] (As monarchs' vices must not be reveal'd) [...] 160 [...] For fear the people have them in the wind, [...] Who long ago were neither dumb nor blind: [...] Nor apt to think from Heaven their title springs, [...] Since Jove and Mars left off begetting kings. [...] This Midas knew; and durst {{communicate}} [...] To none but to his wife his ears of state: [...] One must be trusted, and he thought her fit, [...] As passing prudent, and a parlous wit. [...] To this sagacious confessor he went, [...] And told her what a gift the gods had sent: [...] 170 [...] But told it under matrimonial seal, [...] With strict injunction never to reveal. [...] The secret heard, she plighted him her troth, [...] (And sacred sure is every woman's oath) [...] The royal malady should rest unknown, [...] Both for her husband's honour and her own; [...] But ne'ertheless she pined with discontent; [...] The counsel rumbled till it found a vent. [...] The thing {{she knew she was}} obliged to hide; [...] By interest and by oath the wife was tied; [...] 180 [...] But if she told it not, the woman died. [...] Loath to betray a husband and a prince, [...] But she must burst, or blab; and no pretence [...] Of honour tied her tongue from self-defence. [...] A marshy ground commodiously was near, [...] Thither <b>she</b> ran, and <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> for fear; [...] Lest if a word she spoke of any thing, [...] That word might be the secret of the king. [...] Thus full of counsel to the fen she went, [...] Griped all the way, and longing for a vent; [...] 190 [...] Arrived, by pure necessity compell'd, [...] On her majestic marrow-bones she kneel'd: [...] Then to the water's brink she laid her head, [...] And as a bittour[79] bumps within a reed, [...] To thee alone, O lake, she said, I tell, [...] (And, as thy queen, command thee to conceal!) [...] Beneath his locks the king, my husband wears [...] A goodly royal pair of ass's ears: [...] Now I have eased my bosom of the pain, [...] Till the next longing fit return again.

60|$|The {{street was}} empty when she {{inserted}} the little {{key in the}} front door. There was not a soul there to see her step in as it swung open and then softly, noiselessly, but without any conscious effort of hers, closed again behind her. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> and looked around.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} {{a burst of}} music rose on the air, {{proceeding}} from the water beneath the balcony. Donna Violetta started back, abashed; and as <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> in wonder, and haply with that delight which open admiration is apt to excite in a youthful female bosom, the color mounted to her temples.|$|E
6000|$|... "O Papa, Papa, I want--I want Sylvia!--I am afraid!" [...] Then <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and cowered {{under the}} clothes, {{ready for a}} scolding; {{but it was not}} his angry voice. [...] "Poor child!" [...] he said quietly and sadly. [...] "You must put away this childishness, my dear. You know that you are not really alone, even in a strange place." ...|$|E
60|$|M'liss {{moved slowly}} down the staircase, and Clytie from the passage above <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|A {{light was}} burning there, {{and showed her}} Florence in her bloom of innocence and beauty, fast asleep. Edith <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and felt herself drawn on towards her.|$|R
60|$|Marguerite <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> <b>She</b> felt now as if {{the whole}} {{universe}} must stand still during the next supreme moment, until she had heard what Chauvelin's next words would be.|$|R
60|$|A shiver {{went through}} Tabby, and <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> with her eye upon that big, brown hand; {{but the next}} moment she could have laughed with joy, for pussy saved her. The cat had come to doze on her warm skirts, and when the cloth was raised, fancying {{she was to be}} fed by her master, puss rose and walked out purring loudly, tail erect, with its white tip waving like a flag of truce.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> as the cavalcade diverged, and in {{open order}} furiously {{approached}} the water-course, {{and she could}} see a sudden check and hesitation in the movement in the meadow at that unlooked-for onset. Then she thought of the barn. It would be a rallying-point for them if driven back--a tower of defence if besieged. There were arms secreted beneath the hay for such an emergency. She would run there, swing-to its open doors, and get ready to barricade them.|$|E
60|$|The pity which swelled up in {{her heart}} she kept back with a strong hand. A strange bewilderment was {{creeping}} over her. She had seen only the dark outline of the figure, but surely {{it was not the}} figure of her lover. And then <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and walking swiftly away, passing so close to her that she could look into his white, strained face, Sir Allan Beaumerville strode down the garden, and disappeared {{in the shadows of the}} plantation.|$|E
6000|$|Their {{friends had}} {{slightly}} separated and now, as Sir Claude spoke, suddenly faced round, showing all the splendour of her ladyship {{and all the}} mystery of <b>her</b> comrade. Maisie <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "They're coming!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't ask him anything. I {{only know}} that {{something}} has happened which has robbed him of his power of thinking [...] . Hadn't I better go to the hut? Don Martin ought to have someone {{with him when he}} wakes up." [...] Mrs. Travers remained perfectly still and even now and then <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> with a vague fear of hearing those footsteps wandering in the dark. D'Alcacer had disappeared. Again Mrs. Travers <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> No. Nothing. Not a sound. Only the night to her eyes seemed to have grown darker. Was that a footstep? [...] "Where could I hide myself?" [...] she thought. But she didn't move.|$|R
60|$|These {{appeared}} to be mere steps leading her sight farther and higher to the cloud-navigated sky, where rosy and golden effulgence betokened {{the sun and the}} east. Carley <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> A transformation was going on before her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pull him!" [...] {{his voice}} reached her hoarsely, and <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> {{as she saw}} the man's hand move on the bridle and his heels pressed home. The horse swung clear of the thicket, plunged with head down, flung it up, and {{straightened}} itself again; there was a drumming of hoofs, and man and beast had shot forward from the bank. It seemed an appreciable time before they came down amidst the fern, and then Miss Deringham drew in her breath with a little sibilant sigh.|$|E
60|$|A man {{crouched}} by {{the open}} window, which was some little height from the ground, his arms upon the sill, and his head showing against the darkness just above them. He was, it seemed to Miss Schuyler, horribly deliberate, and <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> while she watched, as if fascinated, the long barrel move a little. Then its muzzle tilted suddenly, a train of red sparks blew out, and something that hummed through the smoke struck the wall. The man dropped below the sill, and called hoarsely through {{the crash of the}} falling axes.|$|E
6000|$|Wee rowed {{in among}} the green rushes and purple water-weeds, and out flew half-a-dozen of the blue-bodied creatures. They didn't seem afraid, but skimmed about the boat, as if curious {{to see what it}} was; and Daisy sat, and stared with all her might. Presently one of the lovely things lit on the lily in her hand, and <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> to watch it. A little shadow of {{disappointment}} passed over her face as she looked; but it was gone at once, and her voice was full of delight as she said softly: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{children}} {{crowded around}} Grandfather and looked earnestly into his face. Even little Alice opened her sweet blue eyes, with her lips apart, and almost <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> to listen; so instinctive is the reverence of childhood {{for the father}} of his country.|$|R
60|$|Grandma Sheldon <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> while <b>she</b> {{looked him}} over. Was he a pickpocket? He didn't appear like one, {{but you can}} never be sure of the people you meet on the train. Grandma remembered with a sigh of thankfulness that she had no money.|$|R
60|$|With that he leveled the rifle, {{resting his}} left elbow on his knee. The {{front end of}} the rifle, {{reaching}} out of the shade, shone silver in the moonlight. Man and weapon became still as stone. Helen <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> But Dale relaxed, lowering the barrel.|$|R
60|$|No swoop {{that the}} Eagle ever made (mentally) down upon base, unworthy, arrogant man, was at all {{comparable}} to the descent which she made (physically) on that occasion {{into the arms of}} an expectant fireman! <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> also the blankets, tightly, as she went down like a lightning-flash, and felt that she was about to be dashed to pieces, but to her surprise soft cushions received her, and she was immediately borne, by another of these desperate men in helmets, into an adjoining house, and left unhurt in the arms of her sympathetic friend Miss Tippet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sir Claude, [...] "I {{was just}} going to say. Let me tell you it will {{surprise}} you." [...] She had finished breakfast now and she sat back in her chair again: she waited in silence to hear. He had pushed the things before him a little way and had his elbows on the table. This time, she was convinced, she knew what was coming, and once more, for the crash, as with Mrs. Wix lately in her room, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> and drew together her eyelids. He was going to say she must give him up. He looked hard at her again; then he made his effort. [...] "Should you see your way to let her go?" ...|$|E
60|$|As Metak bore Bertha Kircher {{toward the}} edge of the pool, the girl at first had no {{conception}} of the deed he contemplated but when, as they approached the edge, he did not lessen his speed she guessed the frightful truth. As he leaped head foremost with her into the water, she closed her eyes and breathed a silent prayer, for she was confident that the maniac had no other purpose than to drown himself and her. And yet, so potent is the first law of nature that even in the face of certain death, as she surely believed herself, she clung tenaciously to life, and while she struggled to free herself from the powerful clutches of the madman, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> against the final moment when the asphyxiating waters must inevitably flood her lungs.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> to listen. It {{was new and}} odd. She did {{not like}} to say Amen; she did not know if the governess were not taking a liberty. Perhaps it was a new way of telling her she was wrong--Christabel, whom she had thought on her side.|$|R
60|$|The way {{in which}} Prue put the case made it {{impossible}} for her hearers not to laugh. But Sylvia <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> while waiting for her husband's answer. He was standing behind her chair, and spoke with the smile still on his lips, too confident to harbor even a passing fancy.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> head {{a little}} downcast; people thought this most {{becoming}} in a young bride; but Andor, who stood {{in the forefront of}} the spectators as she passed, saw that <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> head down because her cheeks were pale and her eyes swollen with tears.|$|R
