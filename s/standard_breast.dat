OBCS {{may be viewed as}} an extension of <b>standard</b> <b>breast</b> conservation surgery for resecting tumors of larger sizes without compromising on cosmetic outcome, or as an alternative to mastectomy. High quality evidence to support the oncological safety and benefits of OBCS is lacking. This review will focus on the best available level of evidence and address key issues regarding oncological safety in OBCS, such as tumor resection margins and re-excision rates, local recurrence and patient outcome, postoperative complications and adjuvant therapy delivery, and briefly discuss cosmetic outcome in OBCS. Comparative observational studies and systematic review report no poorer outcomes compared with <b>standard</b> <b>breast</b> conservation surgery. More evidence needs to be generated to support the oncological safety and improved aesthetic outcome. Prospective data collection will significantly contribute to the generation of stronger evidence.

40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of digital breast tomosynthesis into clinical practice requires quality control procedures. In {{this study we}} have investigated whether {{the assessment of the}} average glandular dose for modelled standard breasts can be performed using a combination of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyethylene (PE) slabs that matches <b>standard</b> <b>breast</b> thicknesses. For this purpose the energies absorbed per unit area of the image receptor when imaging standard breasts and PMMA-PE slabs have been matched taking account of both primary and scattered photons. To achieve this a two-step approach was used. Firstly, the behaviour of the scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR) of PMMA-PE phantoms and standard breasts was investigated using Monte Carlo simulations for various conditions. For imaging without an anti-scatter grid, {{it was found that the}} values of <b>standard</b> <b>breast</b> and phantom SPR were significantly different and it follows that these differences are relevant when matching the absorbed energy. In the second part, a set of PMMA-PE combinations is proposed which, for dosimetric purposes, can be used to simulate standard breasts in the thickness range 20 to 100 mm. The dosimetric error when using these PMMA-PE slabs was found to be below 6 % for thicknesses up to 7 cm and increases to 10 % for 10 cm thicknes...|$|E

The feasibility of breast density quantification {{has been investigated}} using standard histogram thresholding and an automatic segmentation method based on the fuzzy c-means algorithm (FCM). The breasts were chemically decomposed into water, lipid, and protein immediately after image acquisition was completed. The per cent fibroglandular volume (%FGV) from chemical analysis {{was used as the}} gold <b>standard</b> for <b>breast</b> density comparison. Both image-based segmentation techniques showed good precision in breast density quantification with high linear coefficients between the right and left breast of each pair. When comparing with the gold standard using %FGV from chemical analysis, Pearson's r-values were estimated to be 0. 983 and 0. 968 for the FCM clustering and the histogram thresholding techniques, respectively. The standard error of the estimate was also reduced from 3. 92 % to 2. 45 % by applying the automatic clustering technique. The results of the postmortem study suggested that breast tissue can be characterized in terms of water, lipid and protein contents with high accuracy by using chemical analysis, which offers a gold <b>standard</b> for <b>breast</b> density studies comparing different techniques.
