[...] He critiques such a belief by arguing that the accusations of irrationality the new atheists make towards religious people is due to the fact that [...] "when you view people or ideas as your adversaries view them in zero-sum terms your unconscious mind does the rest of the work, making you conceive them and depict them in less flattering terms than is objectively warranted".

40|$|In {{this article}} we first {{describe}} a broad multilevel framework representing the determinants of human behavior and consider its advantages. Expanding on {{the upper part of}} this framework, we then propose the Multilevel Personality in Context (MPIC) model, showing how it integrates and extends past theorizing on the hierarchical organization of personality. The model builds upon McAdams's three-tier (traits, goals, and <b>selves)</b> <b>conception</b> of personality, adding a foundational level (psychological needs) beneath individual differences and incorporating social relations and cultural factors as higher level influences upon behavior and individual differences. New data (N = 3, 665 in 21 cultures) are briefly presented showing that culture, self, motive, and trait variables each have independent effects upon subjective well-being (SWB) and showing that psychological need satisfaction (at the foundational level) mediates these effects as predicted. Consistent with McAdams and Pals's (2006) "fifth principle" of personality, culture had top-down effects upon self-level variables and moderated several of the relations to SWB. We conclude by suggesting some general heuristics for designing studies using the MPIC approach. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

In this article, I draw upon the experience and insights of Koch (1970, 1973, 1977) to illustrate a way of adapting two poetry ideas for use in teaching poetry writing to a group of intermediate level Thai secondary teachers of English. Rather than subjecting model poems to extensive analysis, or selecting poetry for imitation based on strict attention to formal elements like rhyme and repetition –as is often the practice in litarature and writing classes– poetry ideas are designed and presented which allow students to find and recreate within themselves the main feelings of the poems they read (Koch 1973).

She puts forth a thesis in Sources of Normativity in which she tries to address and solve the normative problem.

I argue that such a conception is not only misconceived, it is also ideological in character. Looking back to its origins, I develop a genealogy of modern philosophy’s self-understanding in order to deconstruct it and disassociate it from other possible alternative conceptions of philosophy. I argue that we should reject the notion of philosophy as absolute critique, as it is ideologically motivated and oppressive. Instead, I argue for a more modest conception of philosophy as a subject which provides tools for developing human powers of reflection...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} intimacy, {{is defined as}} privacy, confidentiality, comfort and intimacy, in {{dictionary}} of foreign words. Intimacy is not only in everyday life, but also in nursing. With increasing requirements for quality care holistic care become needed. This care includes all client's needs in gynecological ambulance. Intimacy can be included into the needs of <b>self</b> <b>conception</b> and self esteem. The midwife as a provider of nursing care should meet all the client's needs in the gynecological clinic. Therefore a client who attended gynecological ambulance expects compliance with its intimacy. The theoretical part deals with the client's needs, especially the need of <b>self</b> <b>conception</b> and self-esteem {{and the need for}} certainty and security. Knowledge of history of nudity and intimacy is included. It focuses not only on the client and her personality, but also on the midwife. Midwife acts here as an educator, controls hers communication skills and respects the client's rights. The theoretical part also includes the specifics of nursing care in the gynecological ambulance. To handle the practical part of the thesis method of quantitative research was used. Interviews were used for quantitative research method. For this purpose two questionnaires were developed. One was intended for midwives and the other for clients of all ages. The questionnaires were mapped for area of intimacy and its observance in the gynecological ambulance. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether and how is the client's intimacy in gynecological ambulances. Objective 1 was met. Based on the selected targets were set hypotheses. H 1 : Midwives provide intimacy with clients in gynecological ambulances. Hypothesis H 1 was confirmed. H 2 : Clients who attend ambulances for preventive gynecological examinations, expressed greater satisfaction than to comply with client's intimacy that comes with health's problems. Hypothesis H 2 was not confirmed. H 3 : In the gynecological outpatient clinics is provided by physical rather than psychological intimacy. Hypothesis H 3 was not confirmed.

Therefore, the “translation” of Bellahs theory does not come without problems. A methodological discussion concludes with methods focusing on national self-conceptions. Through this method, the Swedish social democratic notion of the “folkhem” can be related to the notions included by “the American way of life”. The “folkhem” as well as “the American way of life” includes ideas of the nation, made up by specific historical events, in both nations. Those ideas are vital parts of the national <b>self</b> <b>conception</b> in both nations. Historical premises are constantly reborn through the rhetorical reinterpretation, and through the eyes of Bellah, the notion of the folkhem creates a national embracive, ethical value system. The notion of the folkhem still is viable in the Swedish society. Contemporary use of the folkhem-notion is discerned by the threats of globalization and neoliberlismic tendencies. In the light of these threats, the folkhem-notion includes the preservation of Puritanism ideals. ...|$|E

Not only does a subjective self fit into current-day conceptions of autopoeisis and natural phenomenology, but also the features of the natural category force a re-evaluation of how William James’s natural psychology limits the psychologist-observer to a focus on the objective self. The broad aim of the paper is to place within a natural psychology the self as subjective and as object, and the psychologist as self and as observer.

The work knowingly preserves historical and theological planes: firstly it brings basic points for institution of the sacrament of priesthood (Levitical priesthood of the Old Testament, priesthood of the New Covenant and its further rethinking), then it comes with contextual establishment of the Council of Trent (convening, process, discussed themes, follow-up reception of the Council decrees) and its results mainly in a relation to the clergy (theological grasp of the clergy). The thesis subsequently outlines position of the clergymen as a state, upon which society and country put certain clearly defined requirements. The treatise itself then shows individual demands lain on clergymen from the Church reformed by Tridentinum (formation in seminary, <b>self</b> <b>conception</b> of the clergy). All these specific demands are reflected in a stringently designed form of the clerical clothing meant for everyday wear. In this context the work brings inspiration both for creation of the professional clerical clothing and its influence on appearence of the religious habits and finally comparison with [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The self {{has come}} under {{considerable}} attack in postmodern times. Amidst many deconstructions and re-formulations of the self, various myths of self have lost their sustainability. This paper reviews {{a number of different}} theoretical perspectives on the self along with many postmodern challenges to the self. It is proposed that the self is a socially constructed entity which can be conceptualized from a variety of perspectives. We also propose that not all myths of self are equal. In particular, premodern and modern myths of self are inadequate for postmodern times. Building from an existential-integrative perspective, we propose Schneider’s (1990) paradoxical self as a promising myth of self for postmodern times. The self maintained a secure, even sacred place throughout the history of Western thought. Despite widespread disagreement about what constituted the self and the essential nature of the self, few questioned its existence. Contemporary times challenged this privileged place of the self. Technology and pluralism brought metaphors of multiple selves. Postmodern analyses quickly followed questioning whether a singular, essential self was a healthy construction. The influence of Eastern thought, in particularly Buddhist philosophy, introduced the ideal of no-self. Cultural analyses provided examples of cultures which did not have a conception of the self. In the end, the necessity of a <b>self</b> <b>conception,</b> so basic to Western psychology, is now in question...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyse {{individual}} careers towards, during and out of drug use, drawing on the sensitizing concepts of subjective and objective career as analytical tools. Two significant groups can be found, the marginalised and the integrated. The marginalised have experienced insecure relations with their parents. Their experiences of critical incidents have brought about feelings of a lack of continuity in their own narrative. These violations affect the individual’s <b>self</b> <b>conception.</b> Their interpretation of the incidents causes feelings of shame and not belonging. In interaction with others they feel that they lack the cultural capital that is needed, which often increases the feeling of shame. These emotions are also a threat to the individual’s social bonds in more conventional settings. In order to reduce these negative emotions they have to leave settings where those emotions appear. They have to find other settings where new social bonds can be built. The individuals in the second group, the integrated, do not use drugs because their own identity is constantly in question. They have not experienced feelings of shame and there are not any threats to their social bonds to conventional groups. Their drug habit is also often integrated with other more conventional activities. The individuals in this group have also acquired a cultural capital from previous interactional chains, such as the family and education, that is adequate in conventional contexts. They have a competence to display roles in other contexts outside the drug setting. Sociologisk Forsknings digitala arkiv</p...|$|E

Important features of possible selves are discussed, in particular their nature as experienced meaning, their relation with the rest of the self-concept, and their social and cultural nature. It is suggested that agency is an important aspect of possible selves, and that they can be seen as narratives. The clearer definition suggested is that possible <b>selves</b> are <b>conceptions</b> of our <b>selves</b> in the future, including, at least to some degree, an experience of being an agent in a future situation.

40|$|Critical {{scholarship}} {{contends that}} psychology has provided {{ways of thinking}} about our selves that are consistent with the Enlightenment notion of persons as autonomous and self-governing. Utilizing this framework, I examined the interrelationships between psychological conceptions and practices of the self, and the education of persons. I conducted a critical review of self, children and schooling in PSYCINFO from 1850 to 2008, and an analysis of self measures in educational psychology. Psychology’s scientific measurements and classifications have produced an increasingly fragmented self, the various aspects of which are presented as amenable to research-based educational interventions. I also conducted an exhaustive review of elementary school curricula in British Columbia, Canada from 1872 to 2008, to understand the ways that public education has contributed to the production of children as <b>selves.</b> <b>Conceptions</b> of the <b>self</b> in school curricula, derived from psychological theory and research, have resulted in an elevation of goals and strategies of self-fulfillment and individual freedom over citizenship and civic virtue. I then examined how psychological theorizing and research on the self translates into B. C. elementary school and classroom practices and policies. Psycho-educational kits, programs and initiatives adopted at school and classroom levels emphasize personal expression and self-responsibility at the expense of social commitment and curricular content. I contend that psychological theories, research, and practices have produced an empirical self that has contributed much to educators 2 ̆ 7 understandings of the selves of children as discrete, calculable sets of competencies that can be developed and enhanced through instructional procedures. Whether the measured self is packaged as scores on self-concept scales, steps in self-esteem programs, or self-regulated skills and strategies, this self encourages judgements, comparisons, and reshaping of students’ selves in accordance with psychological conceptions and practices of self-fulfillment and self-management. Disciplinary psychology has {{played a critical role in}} advancing the notion of the radically free individual that is at odds with the notion of the active, responsible citizen. A shift to an ontology of persons contingently positioned as sociohistorically situated agents is necessary. On this view, individual freedom and civic duty are virtues that can co-exist in a community-oriented liberal democratic society...|$|R

This thesis begins {{based on the premise}} that individualism is a prominent aspect of American societies meaning its member’s understandings of their selves are self-centered, often non-empathetic, and in general more concerned with their own lives than that of others. The first half of this thesis is dedicated analyzing the American situation through an analysis of the sources of individualism and proving that individualism is actually an illusion that individuals falsely believe in. American Pragmatists John Dewey and George Herbert Mead are primarily discussed to offer a more socially oriented understanding of the self that begins the process of this thesis in defending a relational model of selfhood.

Within these VEs, users can transform and customize several attributes of their avatar, such as ethnicity, gender, body shape, face and clothes (Jin 2012). The possibilities for creating and customizing an avatar may range from a relatively basic icon—such as a two-dimensional character comprising pre-set elements chosen by the user (Vasalou et al. 2008), as in some social networking platforms (e.g., Yahoo Answers)—to a totally customizable avatar as found in three-dimensional virtual worlds (e.g., Second Life). The proliferation of virtual worlds, which {{have been described as}} laboratories for the construction of identities (Turkle 1997), has come hand in hand with an increase in attention toward these metamorphic avatars and the perception that one’s digital body is the desired rendition of one’s self (Comello 2009; Williams 2007; Yee and Bailenson 2007). The chance to experiment with various aspects of one’s personality and body image in VEs, by expressing or modifying various physical and psychological dimensions, has led researchers to investigate the meaning of virtual self-representation in order to better understand its association with users’ identity (Hoffner 2008; Williams et al. 2011). Also, if we consider {{the point of view of}} performative conception of identity, the virtual worlds can be seen as opportunities to enact performances that retroactively constitute one’s <b>self</b> <b>conception.</b> For instance, Cover (2012) has observed that social networking profiles (that include avatars) are tools to develop identity as a narrative in line with cultural demands.|$|E

William Kentridge’s production of “Woyzeck on the Highveld”(1992; 2009) marks at least three intersections of modernist and modernising discourses. Firstly, it uses as its principal source Georg Büchner’s protomodernist text, with its description of an individual alienated from his social context. Secondly, in making use of the puppets of the Handspring Puppet Company for its central characters, the play employs a style commensurate with modernist aesthetics, in terms of the objectification of subjectivity and the mechanisation of the subject. Thirdly, by re-contextualising Büchner’s German soldier as an African mineworker, the production deals with aspects of modernisation by examining the clash, confusion and concomitant syncretism of rural and urban cultures. The article concludes by identifying the all too human desire {{to be more than a}} puppet, more than machine, and the potential consequences of the fragmented modernist <b>self</b> on <b>conceptions</b> of identity and freedom. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to explore how students in upper secondary school can feel, react and cope with writing tasks, time conditions and assessment in the subject of Swedish. The study deals with two upper secondary classes from different schools, one at a natural science programme, one at an aesthetical programme with music as an area of emphasis. The empirical material consists of interviews, grouptalk, observations and student essays collected {{over a period of}} two compulsary courses in the subject of Swedish. The theorethical framework that characterizes the study takes a sociocultural, dialogical and ecological approach to writing. The study deals with questions such as: what are the topics given and what are the instructions like? How are they concieved by the students? What consequences do interpretation and understanding of essay topics have for students writing? What is the relationship between the conditions of writing in school and the students´development as writers and progress towards self awareness? Does school with its culture of assessment create varying <b>self</b> <b>conceptions</b> through writing? The results indicate that theres is a lot of contradictions and dilemmas involved in writing tasks. Students are confused and have difficulties in interpreting the teachers purposes with writing tasks and topics. They often receive double and divergent messages in their encounter with writing instructions and topics. Limited time for writing is used to disciplin the students which have negative effects on their writing development. It is also important for students to develop self disciplin and adjust to implicit cultural and textual norms and rules The study also shows that assessment and negative comments on students individual text products create feelings of shame and inadequacy. Assesment and comments on their texts concern mainly shortcomings which instead of being a challenge to develop texts create feelings of guilt. Explicit writing instruction and teaching of writing is often spars. In the study the students propose different kinds of writing activities where a dialogical approach to writing ought {{to be part of the}} writing instruction. In the students view the act of practicing writing is essential for developing their skills. The study suggests that writing could be part of of the creative potential inherent both in writing and in talking about texts. An instruction of writing could function as a thinking device instead of a grading criteria. Leading students into learning and making text worlds understandable could be a realizable goal...|$|R

40|$|Conrad's use of {{religious}} terminology has attracted mainly archetypal criticism to date, and {{the validity of}} this approach is tested in chapter one. An assessment of Conrad's beliefs begins with a study of the Polish and personal religious influences of his childhood and continues in chapter four by showing how, under the tuition of his guardian's letters, he developed a kind of work ethic, to which he brought the religious intensity of his father; initially towards his life at sea, later towards his vocation as a writer. Literature, in fact, is shown to be the crucial background, not only to his attacks on Christianity but also to the pessimism shown in his letters to R. B. Cunninghame Graham in the late 1890 s. The following chapters study literal religious references in Conrad's writings. Chapter five investigates the sources of Conrad' s knowledge of Islam and shows how his fictional Muslims expose the shortcomings of their European counterparts. Critical views of his use of Eastern religions (particularly Buddhism) are analysed in chapter six and the usage itself scrutinised, whilst chapter seven is concerned with Conrad's treatment of Christianity and its failings. In the final chapters, the figurative religious language is studied. The terms "devil" and "soul" are given secular interpretations, such as "excessive egoism" (devil) and man’s "will" or "power of choice" (soul). Generally, the figurative religious language (including numerous biblical allusions) shows the results of the inadequacies of literal religion in the modern world by indicating man's obsessions for less spiritual occupations such as his passions, his own ego, his personal illusions, his vocation, his <b>self</b> <b>conception</b> or the material and political pursuits of society. Examples are drawn from the whole canon and usually show such conduct to lead to disaster. In this spiritual crisis, hope lies in such simple ideas as fidelity, faith and love but these notions are seldom attained...|$|E

Es wird erklärt, dass Argumente, Aussagen, Urteile und Bewertungen aus Sicht der Europäischen Mehrheit implizit als universell und generell akzeptiert angesehen werden. Eine genauere Analyse des Gegenstands macht jedoch deutlich, dass die Europäischen Positionen Produkte ihrer eigenen sozialen und kulturellen Geschichte sind und daher nicht verallgemeinert werden können. In dieser Arbeit werden drei Paradigmen von der Position der Religion im "modernen" Europa beschrieben. Diese sind: das Paradigma der religiösen Säkularisierung, das Paradigma {{rational}} choice und religiöser Selbstkonstruktion und das Paradigma der invisible religion. Die Analyse dieser Paradigmen zeigt, dass der europäische Blick auf die Türkei von individuellen religiösen und kulturellen Erfahrungen dominiert wird, welche den muslimischen Beitrittskandidaten in den Köpfen der Menschen verdächtig wirken lassen. Solche Überzeugungen und Gesinnungen werden fixiert, bevor der politische Diskurs beginnt und beeinflussen daher das Ergebnis der Debatte. This paper discusses {{the construction of}} religious and cultural others in the special case Turkey, {{as a candidate for}} joining the European Union. The thesis asserts that arguments, statements, assessments and evaluations are implicitly considered to be universal and general assumed by the European majority. However a closer study of the issue reveals that the European positions are products of their own social and cultural history, and therefore cannot be generalized. This thesis will describe three paradigms on the situation of religion in "modern" Europe. These are: the paradigm of religious secularization, the paradigm of rational decisions and religious <b>self</b> <b>conception,</b> and the paradigm of the "invisible religion". A study of these will show that the European view on Turkey is dominated by individual religious and cultural experiences, which make this Muslim candidate country to appear suspicious in their minds. Such beliefs and dispositions are focused and fixed even {{before the start of the}} discourse, and therefore influence the outcome of this debate...|$|E

The Current {{study has}} had as an {{exploratory}} field an educational institutional {{that uses the}} PROEPRE (Programa de Educação Pré-Escolar e de 10 Grau) (Program of Preschool and Junior High School Education) and children aged 5 and 6 years have participated.. The central goal {{of this investigation was}} to know the social diversity present in their social environment, analyzing specifically what they say, think and judge about this subject. It was also studied the influence of family and society in the constitution of the ethnic identity of the child and its relationships with certain aspects that constitute the child personality, such as: self-esteem, self-image and <b>self</b> <b>conception.</b> The research focused the reality of such children, and their characteristics. It also focused the dynamic in the classroom and all the elements that involved the social experiences of the group. It was intended to insert, in this context of classroom, elements that would raise the approach by the children of the different ethnicities, such as: black dools, books of history that presented black characters, magazines, etc. and, among other direct and indirect forms of intervention, interviews were also made with the children and their families in order to beuer know the content of their thoughts and their beliefs towards the proposed problems. The qualitative analysis of the results of this case study was based on Piaget's theorical referential, that reveals an interdisciplinary characteristic. The results found confirm that the child thought is, very soon, characterized by a duality between what for him or her is subjective and what the colective ideology imposes, in a way that this laUer is capable of raising sequelas in the cognitive and affective development of the individual. It was observed that prejudiced ideologies, crystallized by society, affect self-esteem, self-image and self-conception of the black child. Although at this point of its development the child already identifies differences and similarities in its group, this perception is necessary, but not enough to develop negative attitutes between peers. Finally, one conclude that such sequelas in the child development may be, if not total, at least partially softened in the long or medium terms if the. school as an institution and the educator are alert, making available conditions for the children to express their thoughts and ideas towards facts, knowing the real history of their origins and being appraised and truly integrated to their society...|$|E

The FESS is designed to operate in a vacuum and is supported on a low energy controlled active magnetic bearings (AMBs). The goal was to design and experimentally test the <b>self</b> integrated flywheel <b>conception</b> with a smart control of the flywheel rotor magnetic suspension. The low power control approach, with the reduced bias current, of the flywheel active magnetic bearings is used. The weighting functions are de-signed in order to meet robust control conditions. The laboratory investigations of the flywheel with high gyroscopic effect operated at low speed met the control and energy performances requirements...|$|R
40|$|I provide {{critical}} {{discussion of}} conception of and talk of psychic integration which I {{take to be}} both excessive and deficient; these viciously extreme positions are championed by the Apostle Paul and St. Augustine (and both their religious and their secular cultural descendants in the West), and by Jacques Lacan and María Lugones (and their contemporaries), respectively. I suggest that we must negotiate a Buddhist-inspired understanding located between these extremes in endorsing any acceptable <b>conception</b> of the <b>self,</b> generally speaking—a <b>conception</b> which, contra the strong antirealist about selves, allows for the continued use of selfhood in everyday discourse, but which, contra the strong realist about selves, does not fall into an unhealthy idealization of anything approximating perfect psychic wholeness...|$|R
40|$|The {{critical}} {{object of}} this dissertation {{is to show}} that major liberal (and libertarian) theories of distributive justice are unsatisfactory because they rely on highly problematic <b>conceptions</b> of the <b>self.</b> What is problematic is that, in one way or another, they cannot support a proper conception of individual autonomy and personal responsibility. Constructively, the project therefore seeks to sketch a <b>conception</b> of the <b>self</b> that will reconcile as far as possible individual autonomy, and personal responsibility, with egalitarian concerns in distribution. The practical outcome is a revised version of the starting-gate theory, that is, the theory holding that a just distribution of wealth can only be achieved through restricting inequalities in earnings and wealth by the need to preserve ongoing conditions of equality of opportunity, but by no more than that. Thus, the most general theme of the dissertation is the foundational role of theories of the <b>self</b> for <b>conceptions</b> of economic distribution; the connecting element and argumentative strategy centers, both critically and constructively, on notions of individual autonomy and personal responsibility; and the specific positive result is advocacy of a version of the starting-gate theory because of its suitable underlying or implied <b>conception</b> of the <b>self</b> as regards individual autonomy and responsibility...|$|R
