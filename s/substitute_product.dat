40|$|These days, milk <b>substitute</b> <b>products</b> {{are getting}} more popular and exist {{together}} with milk on the market. These <b>substitute</b> <b>products</b> are appreciated by consumers due to animal welfare, environmental or health related reasons. The purpose of the investigation was to make assumptions about the future situation of farmers and which demographic, personal, sociological, cultural and psychological determinants {{have an impact on}} Swedish consumers purchasing <b>substitute</b> <b>products.</b> The proposed methodology to reveal the impact of those factors was a qualitative research. Ten semi-structured interviews with residents of Västra Götaland, aimed to gain a deeper and better understanding of the reasons for consumption of milk <b>substitute</b> <b>products,</b> were conducted in total. The existing theory and scientific articles about demographic, personal, sociological, cultural and psychological determinants of consumer behavior, in terms of food choice and consumption, were used to create an interview guide and also to compare the collected primary data in the end. Participants were asked questions regarding their demography, lifestyle, awareness and perception of milk <b>substitute</b> <b>products</b> and other reasons for their consumption of milk substitutes. The findings revealed that demographic factors such as age and gender seemed {{to have an impact on}} the consumer behavior. Moreover, personal and psychological factors were revealed to have a significant impact on the consumption behavior. In particular lifestyle, perception, attitudes and motivations, knowledge and learning had a significant influence on Swedish consumers and their food consumption behavior. Regarding sociological factors it was discovered that friends had a significant influence on food consumption. Cultural determinants were also important to consider. However, they did not have a significant influence on the participants. The findings also revealed that health and animal welfare were the main reasons for changing the consumption. Interestingly, no participant started to consume these products due to environmental reasons in the beginning. The strong competition of milk and milk <b>substitute</b> <b>products</b> on the market is most likely to continue. The future situation for farmers will look different and might get more critical as milk consumption in Sweden could change. This small scale research does not make it possible to generalize the revealed findings. Nevertheless, this qualitative investigation provided the basis for future research in the field of consumer behavior towards <b>substitute</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R

40|$|The consumer's {{perception}} of a product is affected {{by his or her}} {{perception of}} similar and complementary products available from foreign countries. The subject under discussion is how consumers perceptually relate standardized products in an international context. The specific focus is on how those perceptual relations are connected to each other. A model for connection between such relations has been proposed and tested with the LISREL method. The findings clarify how consumers' beliefs about one product affect their beliefs about other products, the producers of the products, and their own purchasing behaviour. Two interrelated factors [...] <b>product</b> <b>substitutes</b> and the products' country of origin [...] are presented {{as the basis for the}} connections. The study aims to enhance our understanding of international consumer-product relations and brings new knowledge to the study of international consumer relations. The article finds that consumers perceive different connections inside and outside the country of origin. Inside the country of origin, the perception is that both <b>substitute</b> <b>products</b> and <b>substitute</b> producers are connected. This implies that consumers connect much of what is produced and imported in one country. Outside the country of origin, consumers seem to connect <b>substitute</b> <b>products</b> with other <b>substitute</b> <b>products,</b> and <b>substitute</b> producers with substitute producers independent of the country of origin. But consumers do not seem to connect <b>substitute</b> <b>products</b> and producers with each other outside the country of origin. These findings open up a new field of research.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} preemptive patenting in a two-stage real options {{game where}} an incumbent firm competes {{with a potential}} entrant firm for the patent of a <b>substitute</b> <b>product</b> in a product market with profit flow uncertainty. The incumbent suffers loss of monopoly in the product market if the entrant acquires the patent of a <b>substitute</b> <b>product</b> and later commercializes the product. Our patent-investment game model assumes that the entrant has complete information on the incumbent’s commercialization cost while the incumbent only knows {{the distribution of the}} entrant’s cost. We investigate the impact of information asymmetry on the preemption strategies adopted by the two competing firms on patenting the <b>substitute</b> <b>product</b> by comparing the optimal preemption strategies and the real option value functions of the two competing firms under complete information and information asymmetry. Our analysis reveals that the informationally disadvantaged incumbent always suffers from loss in its real option value of investment since it tends to act more aggressively in competing for the patent. On the other hand, the real option value of investment of the informationally advantaged entrant may be undermined or enhanced. The incumbent’s aggressive response under information asymmetry may lead to reversal of winner in the patent race. We also examine how information asymmetry may affect the occurrence of sleeping patent and the corresponding expected duration between the two stages of patenting and product commercialization...|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of how the strength of protection for geographical indications (GIs) affects the GI industry 2 ̆ 7 s promotion incentives, equilibrium market outcomes, and the distribution of welfare. Geographical indication producers engage in informative advertising by associating their true quality premium (relative to a <b>substitute</b> <b>product)</b> with a specific label emphasizing the GI 2 ̆ 7 s geographic origin. The extent to which the names/words of the GI label can be used and/or imitated by competing products—which depends on the strength of GI protection—determines how informative the GI promotion messages can be. Consumers’ heterogeneous preferences (vis-à-vis the GI quality premium) are modeled in a vertically differentiated framework. Both the GI industry and the <b>substitute</b> <b>product</b> industry are assumed to be competitive (with free entry). The model is calibrated and solved for alternative parameter values. Results show that producers of the GI and of the lower-quality substitute good have divergent interests: GI producers are better off with full protection, whereas the substitute good 2 ̆ 7 s producers prefer intermediate levels of protection (but they never prefer zero protection because they benefit indirectly if the GI producers’ incentives to promote are preserved).
