40|$|Software {{testing is}} vital {{for the success of}} any SDR {{engineering}} organization, given the complexity and reliability requirements of radio communications. At Vanu, Inc. all waveforms under development are tested 24 hours a day by an automated system. The test system has been running continuously since 2002. In that time it has evolved in sophistication and {{become an integral part of}} the company’s software engineering methodology. As soon as an engineer checks a new <b>software</b> <b>version</b> into the <b>code</b> repository, the automated test system checks it out, compiles versions of all derived and inter-operating software, and commences testing. Test results are reported continuously to all interested members of the engineering team via web-based reports and an online chat room. Since Vanu waveforms are entirely implemented on general purpose processors using standard operating systems, the tests can run on standard servers without loss of fidelity. A radio channel simulator enables end-to-end testing of communication among multiple servers connected by Ethernet. Since our radio heads exchange digital samples with the baseband processing server via Ethernet, inserting the simulator rather than actual radio hardware is fully transparent to the software under test. This paper describes the architecture of the test system and the design of its major components. Synergies with aspects of the Vanu, Inc. SDR design approach are highlighted...|$|R
