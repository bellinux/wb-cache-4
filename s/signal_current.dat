2500|$|Instead of a {{voice coil}} driving a speaker cone, a magnetostatic speaker uses an array of metal strips bonded to a large film membrane. The {{magnetic}} field produced by <b>signal</b> <b>current</b> flowing through the strips interacts with the field of permanent bar magnets mounted behind them.

2500|$|All {{semiconductor}} detectors function rather inefficiently {{in crystal}} receivers, because the low voltage input to the detector {{is too low}} to result in much difference between forward better conduction direction, and the reverse weaker conduction. [...] To improve the sensitivity {{of some of the}} early crystal detectors, such as silicon carbide, a small forward bias voltage was applied across the detector by a battery and potentiometer. [...] The bias moves the diode's operating point higher on the detection curve producing more signal voltage at the expense of less <b>signal</b> <b>current</b> (higher impedance). There is a limit to the benefit that this produces, depending on the other impedances of the radio. [...] This improved sensitivity was caused by moving the DC operating point to a more desirable voltage-current operating point (impedance) on the junction's I-V curve. The battery did not power the radio, but only provided the biasing voltage which required little power.|$|E

Two <b>current</b> <b>signal</b> {{injection}} methods, the fluctuating high frequency(HF) <b>current</b> <b>signal</b> injection and {{low frequency}} (LF) <b>current</b> <b>signal</b> injection, were discussed. The {{basic principles of}} rotor position self-sensing using these <b>current</b> <b>signal</b> injection and the key techniques in implementation were presented and the simulation models for sensorless vector control systems of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) were established using two proposed rotor position estimation methods. Comparative simulation study of the fluctuating HF <b>current</b> <b>signal</b> injection and LF <b>current</b> <b>signal</b> injection was investigated, and draw the conclusions that the saliency-tracking scheme using fluctuating HF <b>current</b> <b>signal</b> injection possesses simpler configuration and better speed-adjustable performance both in static and dynamic...|$|R

50|$|For serial {{communication}}s, {{a current}} loop is a communication interface that uses current instead of voltage for <b>signaling.</b> <b>Current</b> loops {{can be used}} over moderately long distances (tens of kilometres), and can be interfaced with optically isolated links.|$|R
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the low impedance required by matching, PCB signal traces carry much more current than their on-chip counterparts. This larger current induces crosstalk primarily in a magnetic or inductive mode as opposed to a capacitive mode. To combat this crosstalk, digital PCB designers must remain acutely aware of not only the intended signal path for every signal, but also the path of returning <b>signal</b> <b>current</b> for every signal. The signal itself and its returning <b>signal</b> <b>current</b> path are equally capable of generating inductive crosstalk. Differential trace pairs help to reduce these effects.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The current {{conveyors}} {{as building}} blocks for analog signal processing are studied in this paper. The main emphasis is put on processing of <b>current</b> <b>signals</b> (the true <b>current</b> mode operation) especially on current mode active second order filters.

50|$|The {{collector}} resistors can {{be replaced}} by a current mirror, whose output part acts as an active load (Fig. 3). Thus the differential collector <b>current</b> <b>signal</b> is converted to a single ended voltage signal without the intrinsic 50% losses and the gain is extremely increased. This is achieved by copying the input collector current from the right to the left side where the magnitudes of the two input signals add. For this purpose, the input of the current mirror is connected to the right output and the output of the current mirror is connected to the left output of the differential amplifier.The current mirror inverts the right collector current and tries to pass it through the left transistor that produces the left collector current. In the middle point between the two left transistors, the two <b>signal</b> <b>currents</b> (current changes) are subtracted. In this case (differential input signal), they are equal and opposite. Thus, the difference is twice the individual <b>signal</b> <b>currents</b> (ΔI - (-ΔI) = 2ΔI) and the differential to single ended conversion is completed without gain losses. Fig. 4 shows the transmission characteristic of this circuit.|$|R

50|$|In electronics, a digital-to-analog {{converter}} (DAC or D-to-A) is a circuit for converting a digital signal (usually binary) to an analog <b>signal</b> (<b>current,</b> voltage or electric charge). Digital-to-analog converters are interfaces between the digital world and analog world. An analog-to-digital converter (abbreviated ADC, A/D or A to D) is an electronic circuit that converts continuous signals to discrete digital numbers.|$|E

50|$|If both rails {{are needed}} to carry the heavy {{traction}} return current, then insulated blockjoints are provided in both rails, and impedance bonds are provided to carry the traction current around the insulated joints.

The aim of {{the work}} was to investigateif a {{measurable}} ion <b>current</b> <b>signal</b> exists {{and if it is}} possible to obtain useful information about the combustion process. Furthermore, influence of mixture quality in termsof air/fuel ratio and EGR on the ion <b>current</b> <b>signal</b> wasstudied. A conventional spark plug was used as ionizationsensor. A DC voltage (85 Volt) was applied acrossthe electrode gap. By measuring the current through thegap the state of the gas can be probed. A comparisonbetween measured pressure and ion <b>current</b> <b>signal</b> wasperformed, and dynamic models were estimated by usingsystem identification methods. The study shows that an ion <b>current</b> <b>signal</b> can be obtainedfrom HCCI combustion and that the signal levelis very sensitive to the fuel/air equivalence ratio.

50|$|A {{permanently}} installed current transformer (CT) fixed around the neutral leg feeder to the LNER senses the current. The CT sends a <b>signal</b> <b>current</b> to an external sensing circuit (the protection system) which then sends {{a signal to}} the relevant circuit breaker to open and disconnect the supply or isolate the generator (or transformer) from the fault.The ohmic value of the resistor is calculated {{as a function of the}} permissible fault current and the system voltage to earth.|$|E

Some examples of an inherently digital input would be a 24 V DC/AC <b>signal,</b> <b>current</b> switch, an air flow switch, or a volta-free relay contact (dry contact). Digital inputs could also be pulse type inputs counting the frequency of pulses over a given period of time. An example is a turbine flow meter transmitting rotation data as a frequency of pulses to an input.|$|E
50|$|Loudspeakers usually load audio amplifiers. In audio history, {{nearly all}} {{loudspeakers}} have been electrodynamic loudspeakers. There exists also {{a minority of}} electrostatic loudspeakers and some other more exotic loudspeakers. Electrodynamic loudspeakers transform electric current to force and force to acceleration of the diaphragm which causes sound pressure.

40|$|The {{new high}} speed railway lines, under {{construction}} in Italy, are electrified in 2 times 25 kHz - 50 Hz and, {{in order to avoid}} interference problems between traction and <b>signaling</b> <b>current,</b> make use of a signaling system based on audio frequency track circuits (AF-TC), ranging from 2. 1 kHz to 16. 5 kHz. Problems could arise from the fact that traction currents required by high-speed locomotives, equipped with electronic static converters, show a harmonic spectrum which includes audio frequencies. Since the tracks are means of propagation of both traction and <b>signaling</b> <b>currents,</b> interference problems in the standard operation can occur with possible impact on transportation regularity. Thus, preliminary studies of the compatibility between traction and signaling system (where the traction load is a disturbance source and the signaling circuit is a disturbance victim), under standard and failure conditions, are required. In this context, a measurement campaign on the AF-TC of the new high speed railway system Rome-Naples has been made and some results are reported in this pape...|$|R
50|$|On 12 December 1846, Bain, who {{was then}} living in Edinburgh, {{patented}} a chemical telegraph. He had seen that the Morse and other telegraphs then in use were comparatively slow, due to the mechanical inertia of their moving parts, and realized that the <b>signal</b> <b>current</b> {{could be used to}} make a readable mark on a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, which gave a blue mark when a current was passed through it.|$|E
50|$|If {{very high}} gain is needed (105 to 106), certain APDs (single-photon {{avalanche}} diodes) can be operated with a reverse voltage above the APD's breakdown voltage. In this case, the APD {{needs to have}} its <b>signal</b> <b>current</b> limited and quickly diminished. Active and passive current-quenching techniques {{have been used for}} this purpose. APDs that operate in this high-gain regime are in Geiger mode. This mode is particularly useful for single-photon detection, provided that the dark count event rate and afterpulsing probability are sufficiently low.|$|E

The limit is dependent on dissipation. <b>Signal</b> <b>current</b> flows in inverse proportion to the channel resistances - signal does not modulate the depletion layer, meaning the tetrode can perform at high frequencies.

Chemical telegraphy came to an end in the US in 1851, when the Morse group defeated the Bain patent in the US District Court.|$|E
50|$|The {{system is}} {{failsafe}} {{in that the}} lack of code would display a Restricting signal. The codes would be transmitted to the train from the block limit in front of it. This way if the rail was broken or another train entered the block, any codes would not reach the onrushing train and the cab signal would again display Restricting.
