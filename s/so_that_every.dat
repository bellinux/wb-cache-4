5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E
5|$|Some {{approaches}} explicitly define real {{numbers to}} be certain structures built upon the rational numbers, using axiomatic set theory. The natural numbers – 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on – begin with 0 and continue upwards, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> number has a successor. One can extend the natural numbers with their negatives to give all the integers, and to further extend to ratios, giving the rational numbers. These number systems are accompanied by the arithmetic of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More subtly, they include ordering, so that one number {{can be compared to}} another and found to be less than, greater than, or equal to another number.|$|E
5|$|The {{utility of}} money derives from {{circulation}} and loan-making. A village of ten households may have 100,000 coins. If the cash {{is stored in}} the household of one individual, even after a century, the sum remains 100,000. If the coins are circulated through business transactions <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> individual of the ten households can enjoy {{the utility of the}} 100,000 coins, then the utility will amount to that of 1,000,000 cash. If circulation continues without stop, the utility of the cash will be beyond enumeration.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} Operation Linebacker in 1972 that the problem became acute enough for the Air Force to finally take note. In the three months {{following}} the start of Linebacker in May 1972, the U.S. lost 48 aircraft, 21 to VNAF MiGs and 27 to improved ground defenses. In the same period, only 31 MiGs were shot down by U.S. aircraft and things worsened in the summer with 13 U.S. aircraft lost to MiGs and only 11 MiGs shot down. General John Vogt, commander of the Seventh Air Force, reported to the AF Chief of Staff that they were losing the air war. One immediate outcome was Operation Teaball, which reorganized the entire operational side of the Air Force's early warning systems, and tying them with the Navy's, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> aircraft had a channel providing immediate warning of incoming aircraft. It {{was not until}} 1975, however, that the Air Force introduced Exercise Red Flag to match {{the performance of the}} Navy's TOPGUN.|$|E
5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries {{information}} about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is coded <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> three nucleotides (a codon) corresponds to one amino acid. In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form {{with the help of}} tRNA. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After {{a certain amount of time}} the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of ribonucleases.|$|E
5|$|Moving from {{individual}} graphs to graph families, if {{a family of}} graphs has the property that every subgraph of a graph in the family {{is also in the}} family, and every graph in the family has at most as many edges as vertices, then the family contains only pseudoforests. For instance, every subgraph of a thrackle (a graph drawn <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> pair of edges has one point of intersection) is also a thrackle, so Conway's conjecture that every thrackle has at most as many edges as vertices can be restated as saying that every thrackle is a pseudoforest. A more precise characterization is that, if the conjecture is true, then the thrackles are exactly the pseudoforests with no four-vertex cycle and at most one odd cycle.|$|E
