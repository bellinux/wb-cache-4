500|$|Kills {{discussed}} Perfectionist during 2013 interviews. She {{revealed that}} after having lived a deplorable life in London, her ambitions and dreams influenced the album's lyrics. [...] "I {{was not as}} aware of... how I was", she stated. [...] "I almost {{had a bit of}} fear where everybody wants to be loved, everybody wants to be understood in a way that's not full of judgment or blame. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> all of myself into the album and then [...] bits out." [...] That year, Corner hailed Perfectionist as [...] "one of the most underrated pop collections in recent memory", and Idolator's Sam Lansky opined that although it had [...] "killer" [...] choruses, the album suffered from excessive similarities to other artists.|$|E
500|$|Hooper has cited {{changes in}} the {{cultural}} and political landscape as central influences on the film. His intentional misinformation, that the [...] "film {{you are about to}} see is true", was a response to being [...] "lied to by the government about things that were going on all over the world", including Watergate, the 1973 oil crisis, and [...] "the massacres and atrocities in the Vietnam War". The [...] "lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things" [...] that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by [...] "showing brains spilled all over the road", led to his belief that [...] "man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> a literal mask on the monster in my film". The idea of using a chainsaw as the murder weapon came to Hooper {{while he was in the}} hardware section of a busy store, contemplating how to speed his way through the crowd.|$|E
500|$|On September 22, Dylan {{appeared}} for {{the first}} time at Carnegie Hall, part of an all-star hootenanny. On this occasion, he premiered his new composition [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall", a complex and powerful song built upon the question and answer refrain pattern of the traditional British ballad [...] "Lord Randall". [...] "Hard Rain" [...] would gain added resonance one month later, when President Kennedy appeared on national television on October 22, and announced the discovery of Soviet missiles on the island of Cuba, initiating the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the sleeve notes on the Freewheelin album, Nat Hentoff quotes Dylan as saying that he wrote [...] "Hard Rain" [...] in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis: [...] "Every line in it is actually the start of a whole new song. But when I wrote it, I thought I wouldn't have enough time alive to write all those songs <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> all I could into this one". In fact, Dylan had written the song more than a month before the crisis broke.|$|E
60|$|I had my {{own opinion}} on that point, but did not find it fit to say <b>so.</b> Then <b>I</b> <b>put</b> in what <b>I</b> thought was a master stroke.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, my dear. <b>So</b> {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>put</b> a quiet tea at {{the window}} here, with a little quiet contemplation of the Lane (which comes soothing), between the day, and domestic--' ...|$|R
60|$|Her ear! The dear little ear which <b>I</b> had kissed <b>so</b> often. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> {{my hand to}} each little velvet shell to {{make certain}} that this sacrilege had not yet been committed.|$|R
500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically. According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. I mean, it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day we broke up. Maybe some of the things I say in the song are cruel, but it is how I felt at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wrote the}} initial idea for 'One Sweet Day' with Walter, and I had the chorus...and I stopped and said, 'I really wanna {{do this with}} Boyz II Men,' because...obviously I'm {{a big fan of}} theirs and I just thought that the work was crying out for them, the vocals that they do, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it away and said, 'Who knows if this could ever happen, but I just don't wanna finish this song because I want it to be our song if we ever do it together. [...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [...] was finished, they looked at each other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had {{basically}} the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then and there. We were all kinda flipped about it ourselves. Fate {{had a lot to do}} with that. I know some people won't believe it, but we wouldn't make up such a crazy story." ...|$|E
500|$|Controversy {{was caused}} when Cole {{chose not to}} send popular {{contestant}} Gamu Nhengu through to the live shows. Nhengu was an early favourite to win and many viewers were angry that Waissel and Cher Lloyd were put through despite failing to complete their performances at judges' houses. Around 1,000 people complained to ITV and by 7 October 220,000 had joined a Facebook page called [...] "Gamu Should Have Got Through". Cole reportedly became the target of death threats, and took extra security precautions in her home {{as well as at}} The X Factor. Bookmaker Paddy Power were forced to give odds on Nhengu winning the show after a large number of bets were placed, and made her the favourite to win, but all punters had their losing bets refunded when Nhengu was not chosen as Cole's wildcard. There was speculation that Cole was pressured by producers to axe Nhengu over issues with her visa, but Cheryl denied those claims, saying it was entirely down to her [...] "gut instinct" [...] and that she believed Lloyd, Waissel and Rebecca Ferguson were the best singers in her category. Later in her 2012 autobiography Cheryl: My Story, Cheryl confessed that she had chosen Waissel for the live shows because she was more entertaining, claiming ..." [...] had spent the past two years drumming into me that we needed acts who would be 'good TV.'...she had the character and drive it took to withstand the pressure of the show, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> her through, even though she messed up when she sang in front of Will.i.am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, mamma, I do wish you'd see {{the mouth}} of the oracle. It is so large, and so round, and <b>so</b> ugly. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> my arm into it all the way," [...] said Mimmy.|$|R
6000|$|... 48. It is hard upon you, doubtless, {{considering}} {{the quantity of}} time you must nowadays spend in trying which can hit balls farthest. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> will <b>put</b> the task into the simplest form I can.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{answered}} the little man. [...] "But I {{shall have to}} cut a hole in your breast, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> can <b>put</b> your heart in the right place. I hope it won't hurt you." ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{his years}} in Atlanta, he became friends with David Wilcox. [...] Wilcox along with Boston-based musician, Jim Infantino, {{introduced}} Conoscenti {{to the use of}} partial capos. Conoscenti's unique style developed while [...] "trying to be percussive, trying to be fat, trying to cover the low end, trying to be melodic and rhythmic. I missed the harmonies <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> the harmonies on the instrument - and it's really fun for me to play the guitar." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rick Rubin {{produced}} [...] "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived" [...] {{with the}} band between April 2007 and February 2008. In the liner notes of the deluxe edition of The Red Album, Cuomo stated that the song did not originally have the subtitle [...] "Variations on a Shaker Hymn", but when guitarist Brian Bell's mother came into the studio to see them, she mentioned that the melody from the song sounded similar to a Shaker hymn that the choir sang in her church. Cuomo wrote that he realised that people might notice the resemblance: [...] "I knew {{people were going to}} come at us after and say 'Hey, you guys ripped off that hymn.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> the credit in there off the bat." [...] As a result, the band looked up the hymn and indeed the melody was so similar to Joseph Brackett's [...] "Simple Gifts" [...] that they credited the hymn with the subtitle.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson's {{idea for}} [...] "Black Cat" [...] {{was based on}} a warning to a rebel {{involved}} in substance abuse, in addition to the consequences of drug addiction. Its composition compares the theme to the folklore superstitions of cats having nine lives and black cats foreshadowing a negative omen or misfortune. She also related its title to the bold nature of a panther, saying [...] "I have always felt some kind of connection between myself and a panther. They're not afraid of anything, they're willing to take on anything–that's the way I feel about my work." [...] Regarding its development, she said, [...] "I was getting dressed and ready to go to the studio. The television was on - some commercials and other stuff. I just started humming a melody. I don't know why and it kept sticking in my head. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it down on tape." [...] She later recalled Jam & Lewis saying [...] "they thought it was something that might work." [...] Jackson was heavily involved in the song's production, stating: ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was to say}} later, [...] "I {{got myself}} in some trouble saying that this knock-back was {{characteristic}} of the malaise which the country is suffering, which got into a headline. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> sometimes <b>put</b> my foot in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{tried to}} turn his head, {{but even with the}} effort his eyes seemed to grow glassy again <b>so</b> <b>I</b> gently <b>put</b> it back. Then Van Helsing said in a quiet grave tone, [...] "Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{you see my}} head {{is pretty}} big, and Grandpa says {{it will take a}} good deal to fill it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> keep <b>putting</b> pieces of wisdom into it as fast as I can," [...] {{returned}} Demi, in his quaint way.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> off {{the day of}} {{reckoning}} once more. So I gained time to consult again with Benjamin and Mr. Playmore.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes; I {{have more}} than four-and-twenty pounds. I thought you would come, father, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it in my bag. See! {{beautiful}} white notes and gold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} half-choked, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> {{it back in}} a burrow," [...] he said. [...] "It would have pleased me to hang the brute who set that wire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{found the}} mead so {{extremely}} alcoholic," [...] continued his mother, [...] "that {{it was quite}} unfit {{for use as a}} beverage, but as valuable as rum or brandy in an emergency; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> have <b>put</b> it in my medicine-closet." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Wix rose to it. [...] "Well, it's {{exactly because}} I knew you'd be {{so glad to}} do <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>put</b> the {{question}} before you. There's a way to look after us better than any other. The way's just to come along with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY BRITOMART. But Sarah does; and Barbara does. That is, Charles Lomax and Adolphus Cusins {{will cost}} them more. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> must <b>put</b> my pride {{in my pocket}} and ask for it, I suppose. That is your advice, Stephen, is it not? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I not?" [...] he {{answered}} politely, and I knew {{his hand was}} groping in the darkness, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> out mine and he held on tightly to one finger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{she said}} apologetically, [...] "that's what we keep here {{to use when}} there's a little quiet dancing. You see damp weather spoils it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it there to keep it dry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} get down very well to give the oranges to her, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> them in my little knapsack, and let them down by a string. I had the string in my pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... [43] [What follows, {{to the end}} of the chapter, was a note only, in {{the first}} printing; but for after service, it is of more value than any other part of the book, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> have <b>put</b> it into the main text.] ...|$|R
60|$|I begin each entry {{with the}} last 3 digits of the entry-number, {{enclosed}} in an oval (this is difficult to reproduce in print, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> have <b>put</b> round-parentheses here). Then, for the first entry in each page, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> {{the day of the}} month and the day of the week: afterwards, 'do.' is enough for the month-day, till it changes: I do not repeat the week-day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, you see, {{when you}} got to talking about the funeral, I just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn't somehow bear to spoil it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> just <b>put</b> the bark back in my pocket and kept mum." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I really didn't want to know; but I {{believed}} that the letter was dangerous. If I had read it, I might have felt forced to tell what I found out; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it straight into the fire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell him I hope to {{come and}} see him to-morrow. And say the vases are come. I thought your mother would wish us to have the large ones, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> them in the Church. They are £3." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think not," [...] said Sheen silkily. [...] "I {{was here}} at ten to seven, {{and there was}} no paper on the door then. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> mine up. If you move a little, I'll put it up again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I!--I {{never was}} on the land!" [...] {{returned}} the boy, thoughtfully. [...] "It must be droll to be there; they say, one can hardly walk, it is <b>so</b> steady! <b>I</b> <b>put</b> a question to the sea-green lady before we came to this narrow inlet, to know when I was to go ashore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I want spectin nothin; only Sam, he's a gwine to de {{river with}} some colts, {{and he said}} I could go long with him; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> jes <b>put</b> my things together.

6000|$|... "Sister Seraphina of the Sacred Heart {{has been}} here, {{in a hurry}} to see you on a matter of importance," [...] he said, eyeing Key {{somewhat}} curiously. [...] "She would not wait in the public parlor, as she said her business was confidential, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> have <b>put</b> her in a private sitting-room on your floor." ...|$|R
