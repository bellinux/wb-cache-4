25|$|A novel biodegradable, tough {{elastomer}} {{has been}} developed from poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) for use in creation of a nerve guidance conduit. PGS was originally developed for soft tissue engineering purposes to specifically mimic ECM mechanical properties. It is considered an elastomer because {{it is able to}} recover from deformation in mechanically dynamic environments and to effectively distribute stress evenly throughout regenerating tissues in the form of microstresses. PGS is synthesized by a polycondensation reaction of glycerol and <b>sebacic</b> <b>acid,</b> which can be melt processed or solvent processed into the desired shape. PGS has a Young's modulus of 0.28 MPa and an ultimate tensile strength greater than 0.5 MPa. Peripheral nerve has a Young's modulus of approximately 0.45 MPa, which is very close to that of PGS. Additionally, PGS experiences surface degradation, accompanied by losses in linear mass and strength during resorption. Following implantation, the degradation half-life was determined to be 21 days; complete degradation occurred at day 60. PGS experiences minimal water absorption during degradation and does not have detectable swelling; swelling can cause distortion, which narrows the tubular lumen and can impede regeneration. It is advantageous that the degradation time of PGS can be varied by changing the degree of crosslinking and the ratio of <b>sebacic</b> <b>acid</b> to glycerol. In a study by Sundback et al. (2005), implanted PGS and PLGA conduits had similar early tissue responses; however, PLGA inflammatory responses spiked later, while PGS inflammatory responses continued to decreases.|$|E

40|$|A {{family of}} 4 -hydroxybenzamide-dicarboxylic acid cocrystals has been {{designed}} and subsequently isolated and characterized. The design strategy follows from an understanding of synthon modularity in crystal structures of monocomponent crystals such as gamma-quinol, 4, 4 '-biphenol and 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid. These monocomponent structures contain infinite O-H center dot center dot center dot O-H center dot center dot center dot O-H center dot center dot center dot cooperative synthons linked with molecular connectors such as phenyl and biphenyl, and supramolecular connectors such as the acid dimer in 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid.

Effectively, the acid-amide and phenol synthons are insulated. The short axis of such a structure will be around 5. 12 angstrom and this is borne out in 2 : 1 cocrystals of 4 -hydroxybenzamide with oxalic, succinic, fumaric, glutaric (two forms) and pimelic acids.

The electrostatic dissipating property, probed {{by measuring the}} surface resistivity, was correlated with the molecular weight (MW), the weight content of the incorporated hydrophilic poly(oxyethylene) diamine, and the morphology of the resulting polymers. A wide range of surface resistivity from 10 (12) to 10 (6. 3) Omega/square can be achieved. Poly(oxyethylene) diamine of MW 2000 {{is the most effective}} hydrophilic amine among those studied. The surface resistivity decreased from 10 (9. 9) to 10 (8. 7) to 10 (7. 8) to 10 (7. 6) Omega/square with increasing incorporation of the hydrophilic poly(oxyethylene) diamine from 0 to 25 to 50 to 76 wt % accordingly, in the case of poly(sebacamide) s. Adding a second amine, either triethylene glycol diamine (MW 148) or poly(oxypropylene) diamine (MW 230), to the requisite poly(oxyethylene) diamine (MW 2000) rendered the polyamides to have good structural integrity.

40|$|Intravenous {{administration}} of dodecanedioate (or hexadecanedioate) to anaesthetized rats {{resulted in the}} urinary excretion of medium-chain dicarboxylic acids (adipic, suberic and <b>sebacic</b> <b>acids).</b> In control animals, the recovery of infused dodecanedioate {{in the form of}} urinary medium-chain dicarboxylic acids corresponded to 30 % of the infused dose (22 mumol/ 100 g body mass). This excretion was markedly increased in riboflavin-deficient rats (75 % of the infused dose) while it was severely decreased in clofibrate-treated animals (less than 5 %). The initial velocity of this process was similar in both control and riboflavin-deficient rats. In control animals, halving the infused dose of dodecanedioate to 11 mumol/ 100 g body mass resulted in a halving of the initial rate of the urinary appearance of medium-chain dicarboxylates, while doubling the amount of dicarboxylate administered to 44 mumol/ 100 g body mass did not further modify this velocity, but rather prolonged the duration of the excretion of the resulting products. In riboflavin-deficient and clofibrate-treated rats, the hepatic peroxisomal dicarboxylyl-CoA beta-oxidation activity measured as dicarboxylyl-CoA H 2 O 2 -generating oxidase and cyanide-insensitive dicarboxylyl-CoA-dependent NAD+ reduction was increased about threefold and tenfold, respectively. Dicarboxylyl-CoA synthetase activity was normal in the clofibrate-treated rat livers but was increased more than tenfold in the livers from the riboflavin-deficient animals.

Because of poor aqueous solubility of the drug, the citrate salt, with improved solubility and pharmacokinetics, has been marketed. However, the citrate salt requires an hour to reach its peak plasma concentration. Thus, to improve solubility and bioavailability characteristics, cocrystals and salts of the drug have been prepared by treating aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with sildenafil; the N-methylated piperazine of the drug molecule interacts with the carboxyl group of the acid to form a heterosynthon. Salts are formed with oxalic and fumaric acid; salt monoanions are formed with succinic and glutaric acid. Sildenafil forms cocrystals with longer chain dicarboxylic acids such as adipic, pimelic, suberic, and <b>sebacic</b> <b>acids.</b> Auxiliary stabilization via C-H center dot center dot center dot O interactions is also present in these cocrystals and salts. Solubility experiments of sildenafil cocrystal/salts were carried out in 0. 1 N HCl aqueous medium and compared with the solubility of the citrate salt. The glutarate salt and pimelic acid cocrystal dissolve faster than the citrate salt in a two hour dissolution experiment. The glutarate salt exhibits improved solubility (3. 2 -fold) compared to the citrate salt in water. Solubilities of the binary salts follow an inverse correlation with their melting points, while the solubilities of the cocrystals follow solubilities of the coformer. Pharmacokinetic studies on rats showed that the glutarate salt exhibits doubled plasma AUC values in a single dose within an hour compared to the citrate salt. The high solubility of glutaric acid, in part originating from the strained conformation of the molecule and its high permeability, may be the reason for higher plasma levels of the drug...|$|R

PGS was originally developed for soft tissue engineering purposes to specifically mimic ECM mechanical properties. It is considered an elastomer because {{it is able to}} recover from deformation in mechanically dynamic environments and to effectively distribute stress evenly throughout regenerating tissues in the form of microstresses. PGS is synthesized by a polycondensation reaction of glycerol and <b>sebacic</b> <b>acid,</b> which can be melt processed or solvent processed into the desired shape. PGS has a Young's modulus of 0.28 MPa and an ultimate tensile strength greater than 0.5 MPa. Peripheral nerve has a Young's modulus of approximately 0.45 MPa, which is very close to that of PGS. Additionally, PGS experiences surface degradation, accompanied by losses in linear mass and strength during resorption. Following implantation, the degradation half-life was determined to be 21 days; complete degradation occurred at day 60. PGS experiences minimal water absorption during degradation and does not have detectable swelling; swelling can cause distortion, which narrows the tubular lumen and can impede regeneration. It is advantageous that the degradation time of PGS can be varied by changing the degree of crosslinking and the ratio of <b>sebacic</b> <b>acid</b> to glycerol. In a study by Sundback et al. (2005), implanted PGS and PLGA conduits had similar early tissue responses; however, PLGA inflammatory responses spiked later, while PGS inflammatory responses continued to decreases.|$|E
