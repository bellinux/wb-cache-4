50|$|The flow over a <b>stepped</b> <b>spillway</b> may {{be divided}} into three {{distinct}} flow regimes depending upon the flow rate for a given <b>stepped</b> <b>spillway</b> geometry: nappe, transition and skimming flow regimes with increasing flow rates. For a given <b>stepped</b> <b>spillway</b> geometry, the nappe flows are observed for small discharges. They are characterized by a succession of free-falling nappes at each step edge, followed by nappe impact on the following step. The transition flows are observed {{for a range of}} intermediate discharges. Some strong hydrodynamic fluctuations, splashing and spray near the free surface constitute the main features of this flow regime. To date, the transition flow is avoided for design flow conditions because of past failures.|$|E

40|$|<b>Step</b> <b>spillway</b> flow {{phenomenon}} {{is known for}} about 100 years. Subject of special interest in terms of application in engineering practice is the change of submerged bottom flow conditions for <b>step</b> <b>spillway</b> and surface flow conditions when depth behind the <b>step</b> <b>spillway</b> is increasing. In reference literature and scientific publications there are often theoretical and empirical dependences of determining hydraulic depth, corresponding to flow rates’ changing limits behind the downstream by step.

50|$|Although {{the early}} stepped spillways {{were built in}} cut-stone masonry, unlined rock and timber, {{a wider range of}} {{construction}} materials was introduced during the mid-19th century, including the first concrete <b>stepped</b> <b>spillway</b> of the Gold Creek dam (1890) in Australia.

40|$|Abstract:- Air {{entrainment}} {{plays an}} important role in the reduction of cavitations risk potential in chutes and spillways. The advantages of <b>stepped</b> <b>spillways</b> over conventional smooth spillways, the air entrainment phenomenon, and the flow regimes occurring on stepped chutes have been reviewed. Then the numerical analysis of skimming flow using shallow water equations in inclined coordinate system is described. The numerical computations of air entrainment in the skimming flow over <b>stepped</b> <b>spillways</b> are performed in two stages. In the first stage, the water flow equations are converted to discrete form using the overlapping cell vertex finite volume method on triangular unstructured mesh, and then, in the second stage, the flow field solution results are used for computing air concentration profiles by a separate post-processor. This postprocessor uses experimental relations for computing the inception point characteristics and air concentration distribution profiles along the stepped chute. The computed results of air entrainment into the supercritical skimming flow on <b>stepped</b> <b>spillways</b> have been compared with laboratory experimental measurements...|$|R

In the present study, some porous pooled <b>stepped</b> <b>spillways</b> were investigated with two different porosities of the pooled weir. The air-water flow patterns, air-water flow properties and the energy dissipation rate were observed and compared to the corresponding flat and pooled <b>stepped</b> <b>spillways.</b> The comparative study highlighted a larger interfacial velocity for the pooled step configurations. The largest residual energy at the downstream end was observed for the porous pooled steps which was associated with reduced cavity recirculation and form drag.

Also in this study, fluctuation of velocity vectors, shear stress and pressure during the flow on each step is compared. For this purpose, a physical model of the <b>stepped</b> <b>spillway</b> was built with slope at a ratio of 2 : 1 (horizontal to vertical) and experiments were performed with ten different flow rates.
