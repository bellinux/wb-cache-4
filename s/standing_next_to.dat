5|$|The Vishnu sculptures {{found among}} the Elephanta ruins express {{different}} styles. One wears a dhoti and has a looped girdle, while holding a conch at an angle near his thigh. The remnants of his sides suggest that this was likely a four arm iconography. Another statue has elements of Shiva and Vishnu. It was identified to be Shiva by Pramod Chandra, as Kartikeya by Moti Chandra, and as Vishnu by others. It shows a chain link near the thigh, has a gada (mace) on side, and someone <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him of a damaged upper portion but with small waist and full breasts suggestive of a devi. This statue too is wearing a dhoti.|$|E

She also begins to see the figures {{of a young man}} and a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had been badly {{affected}} by the War, and is prone to flights of fancy. Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> an open window.

Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann that she must be confused.|$|E
5|$|Bennett grew up {{listening}} to Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Judy Garland, and Bing Crosby as well as jazz artists such as Louis Armstrong, Jack Teagarden, and Joe Venuti. His Uncle Dick was a tap dancer in vaudeville, giving him an early window into show business, and his Uncle Frank was the Queens borough library commissioner. By age 10 he was already singing, and performed {{at the opening of the}} Triborough Bridge, <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Mayor Fiorello La Guardia who patted him on the head. Drawing was another early passion of his; he became known as the class caricaturist at P.S. 141 and anticipated a career in commercial art. He began singing for money at age 13, performing as a singing waiter in several Italian restaurants around his native Queens.|$|E
5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E

5|$|Charlton {{developed}} a new ploy for the 1967–68 season by <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the goalkeeper during corners {{to prevent him from}} coming out to collect the ball; this created havoc for opposition defences and is still a frequently used tactic in the modern era. However, for the second successive season Leeds finished fourth and exited the FA Cup at the semi-finals, this time losing 1–0 to Everton at Old Trafford. They finally won major honours though by beating Arsenal 1–0 in the final of the League Cup; Terry Cooper scored the only goal of the game despite allegations that Charlton pushed goalkeeper Jim Furnell in the build up to the goal. Leeds then went on to lift the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup after beating CA Spora Luxembourg, FK Partizan (Yugoslavia), Hibernian (Scotland), Rangers (Scotland) and Dundee (Scotland) to reach the final with Hungarian club Ferencvárosi. They won 1–0 at Elland Road and drew 0–0 in Budapest to claim their first European trophy.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by the deception, Fionna {{takes out}} the crystal sword to fight. The sword {{turns out to be}} another one of Ice Queen’s tricks and turns into a ball of ice around Fionna’s hands. Cake hears noises from downstairs and senses Fionna is in trouble. Undaunted, Fionna uses the ice to beat Ice Queen over the head. Ice Queen pushes her off with a burst of snow which allows Fionna to get close to enough to break Prince Gumball free and knock out the Ice Queen with a broken icicle. Cake bursts in and sees Gumball <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Fionna in her torn dress; she jumps to the wrong {{conclusion}} and lunges at him but Fionna stops Cake and tells her it was the Ice Queen all along. Just then Ice Queen recovers and blasts Cake away from Fionna only to have Fionna knock her magic tiara off which negates her powers. The real Gumball asks Fionna on a date and is turned down; Fionna notes that she does not need a boyfriend at the moment.|$|E
5|$|Females {{typically}} {{lay between}} {{four hundred and}} three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped {{onto the surface of}} the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the tip of her abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or diapause. The larval growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.|$|E

5|$|He {{remained}} on the frontline until December 1915, when the area was evacuated due to the heavy fighting. Due to the extreme cold, Beadles was suffering from frostbite and was found floating unconscious in the water {{at the time of}} the evacuation and was subsequently sent to a military hospital in Malta. After recovering he was sent to re-join his regiment, who were now stationed in Palestine. He took part in all three attempts to capture Gaza and the eventual push to take Jerusalem under the command of Edmund Allenby. During the second battle of Gaza, Beadles witnessed the death of his uncle Richard Pearce who was shot in the head while <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him.

When Mr. Brockway realizes his mistake, and that Darrin is instead married to Samantha, Mr. Brockway tells Larry that he is willing to allow Darrin back on the account. After {{discovering}} that Mr. Brockway initially was unwilling because he thought Darrin was married to an African-American woman, Larry rejects Mr. Brockway's offer. Mr. Brockway expresses disbelief that anyone would reject such a lucrative account. Through witchcraft, Samantha causes Mr. Brockway to see everyone in the room, including himself, as having black skin. On Christmas Day, while the Wilsons are visiting the Stephens, Mr. Brockway arrives, apologizes for his previous actions, and repents of his racism. Samantha invites Mr. Brockway to join them for Christmas dinner, and he accepts.|$|E
5|$|On 16February 1944, the {{day after}} the {{contentious}} destruction of Monte Cassino, Eaton took No.3 Squadron through a break in the bad weather to attack the ruined monastery, the only one of No.239 Wing's units to successfully bomb its target that day. He handed over command of No.3 Squadron later that month, and was transferred to No.1 Mobile Operations Room Unit as forward air controller for the final assault on Monte Cassino. The run of luck that Eaton experienced in his first weeks of air combat in Tunisia continued on the ground in Italy. He survived three months of constant artillery fire, including an occasion when a shell exploded directly above his observation post, striking down a British officer <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him. He also came under machine-gun fire when he took a wrong turn one day and drove into the German lines, but again escaped unhurt.

5|$|The video {{begins with}} scenes of Brown wearing a {{mirrored}} mask inside a giant birdcage, before {{switching to a}} dance routine in a smoke-filled, graffiti-covered parking garage. In between these scenes, the video shows a Step Up-type dance-off in the parking garage. When Brown raps his verse, he is seen <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Rhymes, wearing horn-rimmed glasses, a red Brooklyn cap, and a white baseball jersey, which was the signature look of Mars Blackmon from the 1986 film, She's Gotta Have It. Rhymes then raps his verse after Brown's, standing beside him and later on the stairs in the parking garage. Wayne's verse soon follows after, with scenes of him rapping {{in front of the}} DeLorean DMC-12 sports car, and also on top of an ambulance car. The video also features cameo appearance from Kevin McCall, Diplo, Birdman and Mack Maine. Birdman and Maine appear when Lil Wayne is performing his verse.|$|E
5|$|Episodes one and {{two were}} {{directed}} by Ciaran Donnelly, episode three by Simon Delaney and episode four by Tim Sullivan. Ripley was in the late stages of pregnancy and permitted to work for only {{a short amount of}} time, so the fourth episode was filmed before the third. Ripley did not travel to Portmeirion {{with the rest of the}} cast, so a make-up artist stood in as Jenny in the beach and clifftop scenes, wearing the prosthetic stomach originally made for Ripley in the first series. A close-up of Jenny <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Jo was filmed in front of a similar backdrop in Manchester and edited into the location footage. The producers endeavoured to film on location once per series but the high cost of the Sydney episode and the rising salaries of the cast meant the budget could not permit travel any further than Portmeirion, a village most famous as the location in The Prisoner. Rachel's car accident was filmed on location in Moston, Greater Manchester in the early hours of 6 October 2002. Following the completion of filming, the sets were dismantled and moved to landfill sites.|$|E
