50|$|Polymerization of a {{racemic mixture}} of L- and D-lactides usually {{leads to the}} {{synthesis}} of poly-DL-lactide (PDLLA), which is amorphous. Use of <b>stereospecific</b> <b>catalysts</b> can lead to heterotactic PLA which {{has been found to}} show crystallinity. The degree of crystallinity, and hence many important properties, is largely controlled by the ratio of D to L enantiomers used, {{and to a lesser extent}} on the type of catalyst used. Apart from lactic acid and lactide, lactic acid O-carboxyanhydride ("lac-OCA"), a five-membered cyclic compound has been used academically as well. This compound is more reactive than lactide, because its polymerization is driven by the loss of one equivalent of carbon dioxide per equivalent of lactic acid. Water is not a co-product.|$|E

Different poly(lactide) s are distinguished, namely stereoregular PLLA and PDLA, atactic, heterotactic, syndiotactic and stereoblock PLAs. Because the stereochemistry of the monomeric units in the polymer chains plays a decisive role in the mechanical, physical and degradation properties of PLA materials, <b>stereospecific</b> <b>catalysts</b> to prepare different polylactide architectures are a major topic.

This review covers the research and application of cyclodextrins and their derivatives in asymmetric and stereospecific syntheses, with their division into three main groups: (1) cyclodextrins promoting asymmetric and stereospecific catalysis in water; (2) cyclodextrins’ complexes with transition metals as asymmetric and stereospecific catalysts; and (3) cyclodextrins’ non-metallic derivatives as asymmetric and <b>stereospecific</b> <b>catalysts.</b> The scope of this review is to systematize existing information on the contribution of cyclodextrins to asymmetric and stereospecific synthesis and, thus, to facilitate further development in this direction...|$|E
40|$|The (E) isomer in {{mixtures}} of (E) and (Z) 1, 3 -hexadiene was polymerized {{with the system}} CoCl 2 (PiPrPh 2) 2 -MAO, a highly active and <b>stereospecific</b> <b>catalyst</b> for the preparation of 1, 2 syndiotactic polybutadiene. A new crystalline polymer with a melting point of 109 8 C was obtained. The polymer was characterized by IR, NMR (13 C, 1 H in solution and 13 C in the solid-state), X-ray diffraction, DSC, GPC and it {{was found to have}} a trans- 1, 2 syndiotactic structure with a 5. 18 6 0. 04 A ˚ fiber periodicity. Since only the (E) isomer was polymerized, {{at the end of the}} reaction we were able to separate the (Z) isomer, which was ultimately polymerized with CpTiCl 3 -MAO at low temperature, obtaining a low molecular weight, stereoregular polymer that, characterized by IR and NMR methods, was found to exhibit a cis- 1, 2 syndiotactic structure, never reported before. Molecular mechanics calculations were carried out on the trans- 1, 2 syndiotactic polymer and structural models consistent with the Xray diffraction data are proposed.

40|$|A {{degenerative}} transfer (DT) living Ziegler-Natta polymerization {{system based}} on the cyclopentadienyl amidinate zirconium complex, (h 5 -C 5 Me 5) ZrMe 2 [N(t-Bu) C(Me) N(Et) ] (19), has been studied in detail. Compound 19 is an active pre-catalyst for the living and stereospecific polymerization of a-olefins, upon activation by a stoichiometric amount of [PhNHMe 2][B(C 6 F 5) 4] (18). With a substoichiometric amount of 18, degenerative transfer living Ziegler-Natta polymerization occurs. The extremely fast interconversion between an active cationic species and a dormant neutral species via a methyl (MeDeT) or chloride (ChloDeT) group is essential for degenerative transfer to occur (Rex>>Rp). Under MeDeT conditions, atactic polyolefins are produced due to the configurational instability of the amidinate ligand in its dormant state, with the rate of epimerization being much faster than the rate of propagation (Repi >>Rp). The configurational stability of all the zirconium species involved in ChloDeT ensures that this degenerative transfer living polymerization is stereospecific. Methylating reagents (h 5 -C 5 Me 5) ZrMe 2 [N(t-Bu) C(t-Bu) N(Et) ] (34) and (h 5 -C 5 Me 5) ZrMe 2 [NCH 2 (t-Bu) C(Me) N(Et) ] (39) were synthesized to provide {{a means by which}} a fully activated polymerization system could be brought under degenerative transfer conditions. Adding 18 and 34 or 39 alternatively to a living polymerization system produces well-defined atactic-isotactic stereoblock polyolefins. This allows, for the first time, the production of stereoblock polyolefins with controlled block length, block tacticity and block placement within a polymer backbone. Living stereoselective propylene polymerizations were carried out by {(h 5 -C 5 Me 5) ZrMe[N(t-Bu) C(Me) N(Et) ]}[B(C 6 F 5) 4] (32). A mmmm of 73 % and a s value of 94 % were determined, which is the highest among living propylene polymerizations reported to date. Under degenerative transfer conditions, atactic PP was produced. Using the developed methodology, a family of different atactic-isotactic stereoblock polypropylene (sb-PP) was synthesized with controlled block length, block tacticity for the first time. Preliminary data shows excellent elastomeric properties for the sb-PPs that are synthesized. The amidinate zirconium initiator was chemically immobilized to polystyrene-based solid support via deprotonation and nucleophilic addition reactions at the distal position of (h 5 -C 5 Me 5) ZrCl 2 [N(t-Bu) C(Me) N(Et) ] (40). Heterogeneous initiator (58) polymerizes a-olefins in a living and isospecific fashion. Also, a long shelf time was observed for 58 at room temperature. This is the first heterogeneous living Ziegler-Natta <b>stereospecific</b> <b>catalyst</b> reported to date...|$|R
40|$|Copolymerization of {{ethylene}} with styrene {{has been}} recently achieved {{using a variety}} of homogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts. 1 The presence of a tertiary carbon atom in the styrene units of these copolymers makes stereoregularity possible, but in most of those copolymers previously described the stereoregularity, if present, was not satisfactorily defined. Kakugo et al. 1 b and, more recently, some of us 2 reported the synthesis of stereoregular, possibly isotactic, ethylene-styrene copolymers.

40|$|This {{review article}} {{highlights}} {{the history of}} the discoveries of organometallic <b>catalysts</b> and <b>stereospecific</b> polymerization of α-olefins, dienes and a number of vinyl monomers by Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta sixty years ago, their developments and recent progress. As {{one of the most important}} achievements in the field of catalysis, macromolecular science and polymer materials, their inventors were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963 “for their discoveries in the field of chemistry and technology of high polymers”. These discoveries have stimulated an intensive, both basic and applied research all over the world, up to the present times, leading to great development of the polymer industry. The important biographical data and scientific advancements of K. Ziegler and G. Natta are presented as well. Karl Ziegler, a German scientist, Director of Max Planck Institute for Coal Research in Mülheim, besides many scientific achievements, in 1953 discovered a new process for the polymerization of ethylene into linear polyethylene under mild conditions by using titanium chloride and alkyl aluminium catalytic system that was superior to all existing polymerization. Giulio Natta, an Italian scientist, Director of the Department of Industrial Chemistry at Polytechnic, University of Milan, besides many achievements in petrochemical processes, in 1954 obtained for the first time isotactic polypropylene and Montecatini Co. started its production already in 1958. He conducted pioneering studies on the chain microstructure of synthetic organic polymers and postulated the mechanisms of stereospecific polymerizations. Since the discovery of the Zeigler-Natta <b>catalyst,</b> <b>stereospecific</b> polymerization and processes, significant developments have occurred. The breakthrough in polymerization processes such as fluid bed, liquid phase loop reactor and reactor granule technology led to significant development and growth of polyolefin production. In the 1980 s, a new family of transition metal complexes known as metallocene catalysts were discovered, based on biscyclopentadienyl and transition metal as Zr, Hf and Ti and appropriate cocatalysts. There major advantage is solubility, high catalytic activity, and the easy tailoring of the polymer microstructure. In 1986, the first synthesis of syndiotactic polystyrene was performed using monocyclopentadienyl/titanium chloride catalyst. The development of catalysts based on diimine complexes of nickel and palladium, and of phenoxy-imino complexes of zirconium and nickel, resulted in polyolefins of different structure and morphology, and many new copolymers of ethylene particularly with polar monomers, producing a variety of new functional polymers, reactive oligomers, and block copolymers. The described discoveries of organometallic catalysts and their applications are one of the most valid models and sources of inspiration for the progress in chemistry and chemical engineering...|$|R
