2500|$|Shotguns, in general, {{operate at}} much lower {{pressures}} than pistols and rifles, typically operating at pressures of 10,000 psi, or less, for 12 gauge shells, whereas rifles and pistols routinely are operated at pressures {{in excess of}} 35,000 psi, and sometimes upwards of 50,000 psi. The SAAMI maximum permitted pressure limit is only 11,500 psi for 12 gauge 2-3/4 inch shells, so the typical operating pressures for many shotgun shells are only slightly below the maximum permitted pressures allowed for safe ammunition. [...] Because of this small difference in typical operating vs. maximum industry allowed pressures, {{and the fact that}} even small changes in components can cause pressure variances in excess of 4,000 psi, the components used in shotshell reloading must not be varied from published recipes, as the margin of safety relative to operating pressures for shotguns is much lower than for pistols and rifles. [...] This lower operating pressure for shotguns and shells is also the reason why <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrels</b> have noticeably thinner walls than rifle and pistol barrels.|$|E
2500|$|Rifles and {{shotguns}} containing multiple barrels {{are some}} of the oldest types of multi-shot firearms, and their use continues to this day. These guns are traditionally used for hunting fast-moving or dangerous game, as the simplicity of the design makes a rapid second shot quick and certain; double rifles are known as express rifles or when combined shotgun with rifle, are known as drilling or more accurately combination gun (the term [...] "drilling" [...] is German), the original [...] "combination" [...] guns manufactured in Europe had three bores overposed, but could be fashioned in more or less. The double-barreled shotgun is still the primary choice for most shotgun sporting events, as well as hunting of game birds. The double rifle, due to the difficulty involved in regulating the two barrels to impact at the same point of aim, is prohibitively expensive; for example, a Purdey, Parker or Holland & Holland double rifle sells between US$40,000 - 150,000. Combination guns, containing two, three, or four barrels, most often a mix of rifle and <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrels,</b> are popular choices for hunting in Europe. A typical three barrel drilling mix of a rimfire rifle, a powerful centerfire rifle, and a shotgun barrel allows the taking of a very wide range of game with a single gun. Multi-barrel designs in hunting guns are generally restricted to rifles, shotguns, and combination guns.|$|E

50|$|Another {{option is}} to use a rifled choke in a smooth-bore barrel, at least for {{shotguns}} having a removable choke tube. Rifled chokes are considerably less expensive than a rifled <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrel,</b> and a smooth-bore barrel paired with a rifled choke is often nearly as accurate as a rifled <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrel</b> dedicated for use with slugs. There are many options in selecting shotguns for use with slugs.|$|R

5000|$|It is not {{uncommon}} to find combination guns paired with sub-caliber inserts for the <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrels.</b> These inserts, usually 9 to 11 inches long, slip inside the <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrel(s)</b> and chamber rimfire cartridges such as the [...]22 LR or [...]22 Magnum. These further increase the flexibility of the guns, and will add considerably to the value.|$|E
5000|$|Combination {{guns are}} over/under designs, usually {{with a shotgun}} barrel over a rifle barrel. Iron sights are {{commonly}} used for aiming the rifle, and the front sight alone is sufficient to point the shotgun. Scope mounts are available, sometimes with a cutout for aiming the <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrels.</b> However, the thinness of the <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrels</b> that are usually on top make the scope mounting awkward.|$|E

50|$|The gimmick gun {{introduced}} in the second pilot was a custom-built revolver called the LeMat, based on its historically authentic counterpart. The Le Mat featured an auxiliary <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrel</b> under its primary barrel.

Aesthetically, Ringo's LeMat most resembles the historical percussion model LeMat but features a top break cartridge-fed design.|$|R
5000|$|In firearms, a choke is a tapered {{constriction}} of a <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrel's</b> bore at {{the muzzle}} end. Chokes {{are almost always}} used with modern hunting and target shotguns, to improve performance. Its purpose is to shape {{the spread of the}} shot in order to gain better range and accuracy.

A firing pin selector allowed the shooter to choose which barrel would be fired.|$|R
5000|$|A {{combination}} gun is a break-action hunting firearm that comprises {{at least}} one rifled <b>barrel</b> and one <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrel.</b> Combination guns using one rifle and one <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrel</b> usually are in an over and under configuration. Side-by-side versions {{are referred to as}} cape guns. A [...] (German for [...] "triplet") is a combination gun that has three barrels. A vierling (German for [...] "quadruplet") has four barrels. Combination guns generally use rimmed cartridges, as rimless cartridges are more difficult to extract from a break-action weapon.|$|R

50|$|Many repeating {{shotguns}} have barrels {{that can}} easily be removed and replaced in under a minute with no tools, so many hunters simply use an additional barrel for shooting slugs. Slug barrels will generally be somewhat shorter, have rifle type sights or a base for a telescopic sight, and may be either rifled or smooth bore. Smooth-bore <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrels</b> are quite a bit less expensive than rifled <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrels,</b> and Foster type slugs, as well as wad slugs, can work well up to 75 yards in a smooth-bore barrel. For achieving accuracy at 100 yards and beyond, however, a dedicated rifled slug barrel usually provides significant advantages.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} common single-action rifles would be the New England Firearms {{inexpensive}} break-open rifles, which are built on their 12 gauge break-open shotgun actions. The rifles however are made on a heat treated steel action, and the shotgun actions are not heat treated. Any rifle frame may accept rifle or <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrels,</b> the shotgun frames however are only safe for <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrels.</b> These were originally built by Harrington & Richardson starting in 1871. H&R was later acquired by NEF, and both are now part of the Marlin Firearms family. Rifles are sold both under the NEF and the H&R names. These rifles are quite accurate, and often less than half the price of a bolt-action rifle in the same caliber.|$|E
50|$|Short-barreled, {{manually}} operated shotguns (non-semi-automatics) are non-restricted {{as long as}} the barrel remains unmodified from the original factory length. There is no legal minimum for <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrels</b> {{as long as the}}y are not handguns, and so shotguns with barrels as short as 8.5 inches are available in Canada.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to fire a wad slug through rifled slug barrels, and, unlike with the Foster slug where lead fouling is often a problem, a wad slug typically causes no significant leading, being nested inside a traditional shotshell wad functioning as a sabot as it travels down the <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It is {{a common}} mis-perception that {{shortening}} {{the length of a}} <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrel</b> itself significantly affects the pattern or spread of the pellets. This is not true until barrel length is decreased to under 50% of a typical barrel length. [...] A standard length barrel (e.g., 28") is this long to move the center of gravity of the weapon away from the body and give it an ergonomic heft, and in order for the barrel to extend out into the shooter's field of vision right up to the target, as well as to make the weapon more safe as {{it is very difficult to}} inadvertently point a long gun at one's own body. The pattern is primarily affected by the type of cartridge fired and the choke, or constriction normally found at the muzzle of a <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A break {{action is}} a type of firearm where the barrel(s) are hinged and can be [...] "broken open" [...] to expose the breech.

50|$|Full-bore slugs, {{such as the}} Brenneke and Foster types use a {{shuttlecock}} {{method of}} stabilization by placing the mass {{at the front of}} the projectile. The lightweight rear automatically corrects through aerodynamic forces to keep the nose pointed forward. Saboted slugs are designed for rifled <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrels</b> and are stabilized through gyroscopic forces from their spin.|$|E
5000|$|Firearms having {{combination}} {{rifle and}} <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrels,</b> more than 12 inches {{but less than}} 18 inches long from which only a single discharge {{can be made from}} either barrel without manual reloading: these are designed to be fired from the shoulder. An example is the Marble Game Getter an early 20th-century sporting gun sold before the NFA.|$|E
50|$|Shotguns {{generally}} have longer barrels than modern rifles. Unlike rifles, however, the long <b>shotgun</b> <b>barrel</b> {{is not for}} ballistic purposes; shotgun shells use small powder charges in large diameter bores, and this leads to very low muzzle pressures (see internal ballistics) and very little velocity change with increasing barrel length. According to Remington, modern powder in a shotgun burns completely in 25 (9.8425 in) to 36 (14.173 in) cm barrels.|$|R
5000|$|Handguns above [...]32 calibre are conditional-use; fully {{automatic}} handguns are prohibited to civilians. Bolt-action rifles above [...]22 long and semi-automatic rifles above [...]22 long with a non-detachable magazine are conditional-use; {{fully automatic}} rifles and semi-automatic rifles above [...]22 long with detachable magazines are prohibited. Semi-automatic shotguns and <b>shotguns</b> with <b>barrels</b> between 380 and 600 mm long are conditional use; fully automatic shotguns and <b>shotguns</b> with <b>barrels</b> under 380 mm are prohibited.|$|R
50|$|Automatics {{typically}} have much shorter <b>barrels</b> than pump-action <b>shotguns</b> (especially hunting <b>shotguns).</b> <b>Barrel</b> length contributes to tighter shot spread, so automatics have relatively wide spread. Short-barreled automatic shotguns {{have a very}} high chance of hitting close range targets, and can even hit multiple targets in one area, which is ideal for combat situations. Long-barreled pump action shotguns are more accurate and have increased range, which is ideal for hunting and sporting purposes.|$|R
