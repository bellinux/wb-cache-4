Because of structural features typical of their single-domain nature, they are relatively easy to produce in lower eukaryotes, but it is not uncommon that some molecules have poor secretion efficiency.

40|$|Purpose: The aims of {{this study}} are to assess the hemodynamic {{efficacy}} and safety of PTA in patients with CCSVI and MS, comparing the pressure values measurements obtained by venous catheterization (CV) in the three IJV <b>segments</b> (<b>J</b> 1 -J 2 -J 3) and azygos vein before and after PTA, to the neurophysiopathological clinical parameters of multiple sclerosis. Study design and methods: This is a Phase II multicentric pilot clinical, prospective, blinded randomized trial assessing the efficacy and safety of PTA. From December 2011 to November 2017, 55 patients with relapsing remitting MS (RR 0 = 30), secondary progressive MS (SP 1 = 15) or primary progressive MS (PP 2 = 10), positive at color-doppler sonography (CDS) for at least two Zamboni criteria for CCSVI and a neurologist-confirmed diagnosis of MS, have been enrolled. After providing their informed consent they were admitted to our department and underwent diagnostic phlebography and endovascular treatment for CCSVI. Primary endpoints are (1) a quantitative evaluation of postoperative gradient pressure in the three IJV <b>segments</b> (<b>J</b> 1 -J 2 -J 3) and azygos vein, (2) comparing them to the neurophysiopathological clinical parameters between two groups (group A Sperimental, n= 31; group B Control, n= 35) and different stages of MS (RR 0 = 30) (SP 1 = 15) (PP 2 = 10). Procedural success and complications within 30 days have been included as secondary endpoints. Results: Post-PTA angiographic control showed stenosis resolutions in all the patients. Postoperative gradient pressure measurements decreased in the three IJV <b>segments</b> (<b>J</b> 1 -J 2 -J 3) and azygos vein with no statistical significance (p value: > 0, 05). No stents were ever implanted in the IJV. The feasibility rate was as high as 96, 3 % (2, 3, 6 % no catheterizable; 5, 9, 1 % Orthodromic access for performing PTA only on left jugular vein). Overall major and minor complication rates at 30 days were 0, 05 % and 0, 02 %, respectively. Clinical analysis not showed significantly improvement (or worsening) associated with the intervention between groups (A, sperimental / B, control, p value > 0, 05), and different stages of MS (RR 0 = 30 p value > 0, 05) (SP 1 = 15, p value > 0, 05) (PP 2 = 10, p value > 0, 05). Conclusion: Study’s aim is to assess the efficacy of PTA on CCSVI and MS patients’ functional disability. Endovascular treatment of the IJV is proven to be a safe procedure (major complication < 0, 05 %) with no significant improvement of IJV flow haemodynamic parameters and clinical improvement in patients with CCSVI and MS.

Among the members of this family, represented by the Vκ 21 group of plasmacytomas, are examples in which six different germ-line V genes are joined to four different <b>J</b> <b>segments</b> in various combinations. The mRNA precursors were identified by hybridizing a cloned κ-cDNA probe to poly(A) -containing nuclear RNAs that were size fractionated on methylmercury-agarose gels and transferred to diazotized paper.

The <b>J</b> <b>segments</b> were thus located at distances ranging from 2. 4 to 4. 8 kilobases from the constant-region gene. Different V genes joined to the same <b>J</b> <b>segment</b> exhibited similar precursor patterns, suggesting that the size of the translocated V segment may be relatively uniform among members of the Vκ 21 group.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the variable region sequences of four heavy chains from β(1 - 6) D-galactan-binding myeloma proteins. Two of these proteins are identical to position 100 {{which is located}} in the third complementarity-determining region (CDR- 3). The remaining two differ at a total of 8 positions over the first 100 amino acids, and all of the differences can be explained by single-base mutations at the DNA level. When an assessment is made of the protein segment following CDR- 3, which has been termed “J segment” or “FR 4,” a completely different pattern of variation is observed. The <b>J</b> <b>segments</b> from the four proteins can be divided into two sets. Members of each set share a series of linked amino acids not found in members of the alternative set. The two proteins identical to position 100 have <b>J</b> <b>segments</b> from the two different sets, suggesting that recombination has occurred between V and J genes. An examination of the CDR- 3 sequences from the four heavy chains reveals substitutions at positions 100 and 105. Gly is found at 100 in two of the proteins and His in the remaining two. In the two proteins with Gly- 100, the following J sequence is limited to one of the two sets of <b>J</b> <b>segments</b> defined by linked amino acids. Similarly, the two heavy chains with His- 100 have <b>J</b> <b>segments</b> from the second set. Thus, at the protein level an apparent association is seen between CDR- 3 and <b>J</b> <b>segment.</b> If CDR- 3 should be found linked to <b>J</b> <b>segment</b> at the DNA level, a new mechanism would be introduced for increasing antibody diversity by recombining various CDR- 3 plus J genes with genes coding {{for the remainder of the}} variable region.

30|$|The key {{ambition}} of this ASFR evolution {{is to provide}} designs immune to the 1 : 2 issue. Inspired by the EFFR approach introduced in literature [10], CR techniques is implemented in the ASFR design, and FBSs are offered additional secondary spectrum--the local macrocell radio channels, while their original available spectrum is made primary, as in Figure 3. Let FBS 1,nbe in the cell edge of Cell A, by now it has one primary spectrum segment: j (j ∈ { 1, 2, 3 }), and two secondary spectrum segments: <b>segment</b> (<b>j</b> (mod 3) + 1) and <b>segment</b> ((<b>j</b> + 1) (mod 3) + 1). As we all know, secondary spectrum reuse is always accompanied by sorts of spectrum detection tools and criterions, and extra costs as well. To improve spectrum efficiency, while {{not to make the}} existing cellular system become too complex, detection of the secondary spectrum is triggered if and only if the primary spectrum is exhausted. In the following, an optimized detection criterion is generated, which further distinguish the two secondary segments of cell-edge FBSs: To improve the secondary spectrum detection efficiency, <b>segment</b> (<b>j</b> (mod 3) + 1) is designed as the primary one out of the two secondary spectrum of FBS 1,n, and ((j + 1) (mod 3) + 1) as the secondary one, respectively, named primary-secondary (PS) spectrum and secondary-secondary (SS) spectrum for FBS 1,nillustrated in Figure 3. The detection of SS is triggered if and only if PS is exhausted. This means that FBS 1,nstarts secondary spectrum detection from PS (j mod 3 + 1) and only when the PS cannot satisfy the spectrum requirements, SS ((j + 1) (mod 3) + 1) is detected and allocated. Meanwhile, the MBS A is designed to start its spectrum allocation from a different point, i.e., SS other than PS of FBS 1,n. In this way, when loading factor of MBS A is lower than 1 / 3 and neglecting effects of other femtocells, the probability of successful secondary spectrum detection on PS of can be 100 %, since the PS segment of FBS 1,nis not occupied by the local macrocell. Obviously, it would be too late to trigger secondary spectrum detection after the exhaustion of the primary one. Assuming that traffic load is estimated at each cell, a mechanism is designed to support suitable detection time: (1) two thresholds are defined: load thresh 1 and load thresh 2, with load thresh 1 < load thresh 2; (2) before the load of FBS 1,nreach load thresh 1, no channel measurements on PS is needed, and before the load of FBS 1,nreach load thresh 2, no measurements on the SS is needed. Thus, the overheads of detection are reduced and efficiency of detection is improved. Values of the two thresholds are closely correlated with the IFI condition of given environments.|$|E

The purpose of this package is to process and quantitatively analyse millions of V-CDR 3 -J combination, called clonotypes, from multiple libraries...|$|R
5|$|Somatic {{recombination}} of immunoglobulins, {{also known}} as V(D)J recombination, involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (<b>J)</b> <b>segments.</b> V, D and <b>J</b> <b>segments</b> are found in Ig heavy chains, but only V and <b>J</b> <b>segments</b> are found in Ig light chains. Multiple copies of the V, D and <b>J</b> gene <b>segments</b> exist, and are tandemly arranged in the genomes of mammals. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one <b>J</b> gene <b>segment</b> (or one V and one <b>J</b> <b>segment</b> in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments {{can be used to}} generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different , and thus different antigen specificities. Interestingly, the rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.|$|R
