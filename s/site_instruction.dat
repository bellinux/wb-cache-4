The {{purpose of this study}} was to unearth causes of disputes and their effects on construction projects and to further determine the methods that are used to settle the disputes. In order to determine the objectives of this study, semi-structured interviews were used. Thirty practitioners i. e. professionals in the construction industry were purposively invited to participate. Fourteen practitioners accepted to participate in the interviews which represented 47 % response rate. The results of the interviews were analyzed using content analysis that is coding of reoccurring themes from the interviews. The study revealed nine factors that contribute to causes of disputes in construction projects namely; poor communication, poor contract documentation, suspension of work, failure to understand and correctly bid or price the work, bad weather, non-circulation of information, i. e. <b>site</b> <b>instruction,</b> distribution of drawings etc., incomplete tracing mechanism for request of information and delay in extension of time. Furthermore, the effects of disputes identified were; project delays, change in contract cost leading to cost overrun, deterioration of relationships or bad relationships leading to friction, parties do not get information on time and neglecting clients’ needs. In order to resolve the disputes the most popular method used was arbitration. However, some respondents opted to use conciliation and mediation. The practicality of the study is that organizations that enter into construction projects should be aware that they may encounter disputes in their projects; hence they should know the methods they can use to resolve them...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} and understand the meaning of responses of study participants to interactive computer-mediated communication within a distance learning environment. The theoretical framework for this study was based on collaborative learning theories within a constructivist perspective. The study setting was a distance learning graduate course taught in a studio classroom on Ball State University campus and transmitted via the IHETS Network to five distant sites in Indiana. An interactive Internet site, the Class Page, was an important instructional component of the course. This Class Page was developed to enable and support active, collaborative learning among distance learners. Study participants, all graduate students enrolled in degree programs, included 13 studio students and 24 off site students. One professor and two graduate assistants delivered course and Web <b>site</b> <b>instruction.</b> In this descriptive study, responses of participants were collected through a series of surveys and interviews over the sixteen week semester. Evidence collection focused on learner responses to the computer component of this distance learning setting. Identified in this study were cognitive and affective learning strategies developed and employed by students to effectively learn from the educational environment of computer-mediated communication within this study's setting. Two cognitive learning strategies identified were the `management of the computer environment' and the `management of personal resources. ' Two affective learning strategies identified were the `management of self and the `management of others. ' The computer medium of this setting played an important role in determining how students responded to, and learned within, this distance learning environment. Learners' responses to this multimedia distance setting were shaped by specific aspects of the learning environment. The development of the cognitive and affective learning strategies was influenced by the instructional design of the distance course and the Class Page, the structure of Class Page interactivity, and the characteristics of individual learners. Conclusions and recommendations of this study focused on these four influences upon student responses. Implications for future distance education design and development included the need for a clear model of distance learner participation and further research requirements in areas such as learner characteristics, applications of interactive media, and course design issues.

40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{presented to}} the Higher Degrees Committee of the Cape Peninsula University of Technology in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology: Construction Management, 2012 This study investigated {{the underlying causes of}} rework in construction projects and the impact on overall project performance so that effective containment and reduction strategies can be developed. The objectives of the study were as follows: (i) to determine the influence different project types have on the causes of rework in construction projects; (ii) to determine the impact of rework on organisational and project performance; (iii) to determine the influence various project types have on rework costs (direct and indirect) in construction projects; (iv) to determine the influence various procurement methods have on total rework costs in construction projects; (v) to design and develop rework reduction and containment strategies. The research was motivated by several international and local studies demonstrating a lack of concern for the root causes of rework and the potential impact on cost, overall project performance, and the ‘value-addedness’ to the completed project. The research approach adopted included an exploratory and main study targeting purposively selected construction professionals and stakeholders in the Cape Peninsula metropolitan area of the Western Cape Province. The exploratory case study was carried out at the initial stage of the study to gain more insight into the causes and impact of rework on overall project performance. Specifically, data was collected by means of observation of physical works, semi-structured interviews with relevant parties directly involved in site operation and the analysis of <b>site</b> <b>instruction</b> record documents. The main study obtained data from 78 construction professionals and stakeholders via questionnaire survey, a survey conducted among design consultants and contractors in the general building category ranging from grade 3 to 9 who are registered with Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB). Descriptive, inferential statistics and probability distribution functions were used to analyse the data. The findings revealed that changes initiated by the client, changes initiated by the design team due to errors and omissions, poor coordination, and finally, integration among the design team were the major contributing factors to rework. Moreover, non-compliance with specifications, setting-out errors, low labour skills, and emphasis on time and cost aggravated the occurrence of rework on site. The study revealed that while there is {{no significant difference between the}} causes of rework and various project types, rework can and often does make a significant contribution to any project’s cost overrun. The total mean cost of rework as a percentage of the original contract value for new build project and refurbishment/renovation projects was 4. 89 % and 6. 28 % respectively. However, rework costs do not differ relative to project type or procurement method. Furthermore, the study revealed that cost overruns, time overruns and design team dissatisfaction all impacted on project performance. The findings indicate that designrelated rework can be minimised by implementing the following strategies: team building, involvement of subcontractors and suppliers, and design for construction. Moreover, involvement of subcontractors during construction, and the implementation of quality control and site quality management systems could also lead to reduction in rework during the construction phase. Furthermore, the probabilistic analysis of rework occurrence was determined in the projects selected; this analysis predicts the occurrence of rework so that a quantitative risk assessment could be undertaken prior to the commencement of construction. The research concludes by recommending that design and construction firms must develop organisational measurement systems for recording rework occurrence and its associated costs. It is by determining the frequency and costs of rework that effective strategies for its containment and reduction can be identified...|$|E

The study had the following objectives, namely (1) to investigate the prevalence of variation orders on construction projects; (2) to determine the cost impact of variation orders; (3) to examine to what extent variation orders added value to construction projects; (4) to determine whether the activities associated with variation orders may be regarded as waste; (5) to identify the predominant origin agent as well as the causes of variation orders; and (6) to establish {{the nature and extent of}} the impact of variation orders on overall project performance. Literature relative to the research area was extensively reviewed. The data gathering approaches included an exploratory study on costs of variation orders on two construction projects, interviews with three top management personnel in construction contracting companies, the audit of <b>site</b> <b>instructions</b> with regard to waste and their value-addedness and self-administered questionnaires. A purposive sampling method was followed to identify participants into the study. The audit of <b>site</b> <b>instructions</b> revealed that most variation orders were beneficial. However, 14 % of <b>site</b> <b>instructions</b> had waste associated with them. It was possible to quantify apparent waste associated with variation orders by means of an ‘origin-cause matrix’ designed for that purpose. Problematic situations arising from the occurrence of variation orders included discrepancies between the claimed and certified amounts. Variation orders impacted project performance with regard to cost and time overruns and disputes between parties to the contract. Most variation orders involved additional works. The complexity of works was the most predominant factor influencing the occurrence of variation orders. The reduction of the occurrence of variation orders was traced back to the pre-contract stage given that the most predominant origin agent of variation orders was the client and then due to an unclear brief of works to be executed. Suggestions regarding the reduction of variation orders include (1) adequate planning in advance is required by all involved parties before works start on site, (2) consultants should do a thorough concluding design and working drawings and contract documents should be complete at tender stage, (3) clients should provide clear brief, (4) enhance communication and all parties should be proactive at all times, (5) works should be supervised with an experienced and dedicated supervisor and (6) consultant should ensure that the design/specifications fall within the approved budget and the budget team should be appointed and participate during the design phase. The study suggests further investigation regarding the development of a more equitable basis of valuation of cost recovery which was beyond the scope of this research...|$|R

40|$|Proefskrif (PhD (Vergelykende Opvoedkunde)) [...] PU vir CHO, 1997 Support {{services}} are indispensable for the effective functioning of education. Support services render specific, specialized {{services to the}} school (the <b>site</b> of <b>instruction),</b> teachers (trainers) and pupils (learners) and constitute {{part of the system}} of both formal and non-formal education. Although contributions by South African authors such as Ruperti, Van Schalkwyk and Lazarus and Donald provide valuable information, there is at present a need for a model for support services to provide in the changing needs of the target group. In this research the various theories with regard to support services as a component of the education system and the mini-education system were discussed. Some brief examples of support services as they function in practice were also discussed. An analysis was made of the different viewpoints, a new perspective provided on support services, and possible organizational structures were discussed for purposes of the organization of support services within the education system. Subsequently attention was directed to the personal situation of the trainer. From the literature it was demonstrated that the trainer would benefit by the support services with regard to both his professional and academic equipment, the different relationships in which he finds himself, his personality profile and his personal circumstances. Attention was then focused on the various fields in which educational events and structures in the South African education system can make use of support services in order to function more optimally. From the literature the conclusion was reached that the educational events and structures can be supported with regard to the equipping task of the <b>site</b> of <b>instruction,</b> management tasks situated in the <b>site</b> of <b>instruction</b> and the physical facilities of the <b>site</b> of <b>instruction.</b> It was also indicated from the literature that the learner has a need with regard to his personal situation. Support needs {{in the case of the}} learner were discussed by way of handicaps of learners, disabilities of learners, the parental community in which the learner finds himself, and the extent of stress experienced by the learner. Interviews were conducted with focus groups in practice in order to determine whether the needs for support services as identified from the literature were valid needs. Following this research a model for support services in an education system was proposed by way of graphic representations supported by discussions. Attention was also given to a possible organizational structure according to which one could manage such support services. In conclusion, the research was summarized in brief. Certain findings were underlined in terms of the objectives and certain recommendations were made with regard to possiblities for further research emanating from the results of this project.
