5|$|Of {{the entire}} party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any {{experience}} with dog-sledges. The {{results of the}} men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, and tended to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. The dangers of the unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. In their attempts to find safer ground, one of the group, Able Seaman George Vince, <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> {{the edge of a}} cliff and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still stands at the summit of the Hut Point promontory.|$|E
25|$|Friction is {{damaging}} to the superficial blood vessels directly under the skin. It occurs when two surfaces rub against each other. The skin over the elbows and can be injured due to friction. The back can also be injured when patients are pulled or <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> bed sheets while being moved up in bed or transferred onto a stretcher.|$|E
25|$|Mont Saint-Hilaire {{is one of}} the Monteregian Hills, a {{group of}} erosional {{remnants}} of intrusive mountains spreading across southern Quebec. It is composed of three distinct plutonic intrusions that formed during the Cretaceous Period between 133 and 120million years ago. Like the other Monteregian Hills, Mont Saint-Hilaire forms part of the Great Meteor hotspot track, which was created when the North American Plate <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> the New England hotspot. During this time, melting occurred, creating subsurface magma intrusions. Erosion of the surrounding softer sedimentary rocks revealed the more resistant rocks of Mont Saint-Hilaire.|$|E

60|$|Seven war-canoes were {{launched}} and manned by paint-daubed, befeathered warriors. Long spears bristled from the rude battle-ships, as they <b>slid</b> noiselessly <b>over</b> {{the bosom of}} the water, propelled by giant muscles rolling beneath glistening, ebony hides.|$|R
25|$|Sprague began {{racing in}} the Trucks' {{first year of}} {{competition}} in 1995. He began the season in the No. 31 Chevrolet Silverado for Griffin Racing, winning the pole at Louisville Speedway. After the Action Packed Racing Cards 150, Sprague switched to the No. 25 Budweiser-sponsored Chevy for Hendrick Motorsports. He ended {{the season with a}} pole at Phoenix International Raceway, and had three fourth-place finishes. In 1996, he <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> to the No. 24 Quaker State-sponsored truck owned by Hendrick, winning his first race at Phoenix, followed up by back-to-back victories at Nazareth Speedway and The Milwaukee Mile. With five wins total and two poles, Sprague lost the championship by 53 points. That season, he made his Winston Cup debut, running a pair of races in the No. 52 Pedigree Petfoods-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix for Ken Schrader. He led two laps and finished 23rd in his debut at Phoenix, but wrecked the following week at Atlanta Motor Speedway.|$|E
25|$|Castleford {{where the}} winner would reach the final. 3,000 people turned up to first see Thompson score a penalty after 15 minutes, but then Nigere Tariu <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> {{to put the}} Islanders ahead. Just before the break however, Tait charged through three players to put Scotland back in the game. In the second half the Cook Islands, with several NRL players in their ranks, showed their {{strength}} as Sonny Shepherd scored a controversial try as Scottish players complained about the grounding. From a play the ball Shepherd went over again and in the 73rd minute Tariu scored a converted try. The Bravehearts did get a late consolation, skipper Tait going over for Scotland's last try before Islander Ali Davys sealed Scotland's fate with a drop-goal. The match finished Scotland 10–21 Cook Islands. In the final the Cook Islands beat Ireland 22–6 in Bury to win the tournament and secure {{a place in the}} next World Cup. Despite losing this final match the Scotland team and supporters thought that they had done very well considering how young the team was and how well their performances had been against Russia and the USA.|$|E
500|$|When the hollow-front {{projectile}} {{reached the}} target and <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> the target insert, the assembled super-critical mass of uranium would be completely surrounded by a tamper and neutron reflector of tungsten carbide and steel, both materials having a combined mass of [...] Neutron initiators {{at the base of}} the projectile were activated by the impact.|$|E
6000|$|... "Entirely," [...] said Mr. Polteed, {{appearing}} suddenly {{between him}} and the door. [...] "I shall be seeing you in that other case before long. Good morning, sir." [...] His eyes <b>slid</b> unprofessionally <b>over</b> Soames once more, and he unlocked the door.|$|R
60|$|The road now {{ran along}} the side of a hill. Here the heavy fall of snow had <b>slid</b> down <b>over</b> the rocks and the going was {{anything}} but safe. The faithful old horses had all they could do to keep their footing.|$|R

500|$|After a brief {{return to}} Sumatra, Amir {{continued}} to a Boedi Oetomo-operated Algemene Middelbare School (AMS; senior high school) in Surakarta, Central Java, {{where he studied}} eastern literature and languages, including Javanese, Sanskrit, and Arabic. Preferring solitude to the bustle of the dormitories, Amir boarded at a privately-owned home of a Surakartan resident. Later he met several future writers, including Armijn Pane and Achdiat Karta Mihardja; they soon {{found him to be}} a friendly and diligent student with complete notes and a spotless bedroom (sheets folded so well, Mihardja later recalled, that a [...] "lost fly could have easily <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> them"), but also a romantic prone to thinking wistfully beneath the lamplight and isolating himself from his classmates.|$|E
500|$|By 18:12, {{just before}} sunset, another {{formation}} of T Attack Force pilots was closing to within striking {{range of the}} task groups. Six more planes were shot down {{in the vicinity of}} TG38.4 in the span of twenty minutes. A subsequent group of six Mitsubishi G4M [...] "Betty" [...] bombers which had penetrated the picket and evaded the CAP made determined attacks on the carriers of TG38.4, putting four torpedoes in the water before all six were shot down by shipboard anti-aircraft guns. One torpedo ran just ahead of the , and another ran too deep and passed beneath the carrier. One of the Bettys attempted to crash into Franklin on its way down but glanced off the flight deck and <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> the starboard edge of the ship into the water.|$|E
500|$|Inside the weapon, the {{uranium-235}} {{material was}} divided into two parts, following the gun principle: the [...] "projectile" [...] and the [...] "target". The projectile was a hollow cylinder with 60% of the total mass (...) [...] It consisted of a stack of 9 uranium rings, each [...] in diameter with a [...] bore in the center, and a total length of , pressed together into {{the front end of}} a thin-walled projectile [...] long. Filling in the remainder of the space behind these rings in the projectile was a tungsten carbide disc with a steel back. At ignition, the projectile slug was pushed [...] along the [...] long, [...] smooth-bore gun barrel. The slug [...] "insert" [...] was a [...] cylinder, [...] in length with a [...] axial hole. The slug comprised 40% of the total fissile mass (...) [...] The insert was a stack of 6 washer-like uranium discs somewhat thicker than the projectile rings that were <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> a [...] rod. This rod then extended forward through the tungsten carbide tamper plug, impact-absorbing anvil, and nose plug backstop, eventually protruding out of the front of the bomb casing. This entire target assembly was secured at both ends with locknuts.|$|E
60|$|In {{the end of}} {{the second}} inning Roxley was {{fortunate}} enough to open the play with a neat drive which brought the batter to second. Then came another one-base hit, and amid a wild yelling the runner from second <b>slid</b> in <b>over</b> the home plate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Out of the light, porpoise!" [...] {{with the}} result that the Prince's horse took fright, and reared up so high that its rider <b>slid</b> off <b>over</b> its tail to find himself seated on the ground, a sorry {{spectacle}} in his gorgeous robes and armour.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} AIR-9 {{design was}} re-worked in 1934 to include enclosed cockpits, but dispensing with the automatic slats. The tandem cockpits were fitted with sliding canopies; the forward canopy <b>slid</b> rearwards <b>over</b> the fixed centre canopy section and the rear canopy slid forwards under the centre-section.|$|R
2500|$|The guard (top center) is <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> the {{foreskin}} {{as close}} to the glans as possible to allow for maximum removal of the former without any injury to the latter. [...] The scalpel is used to detach the foreskin, and the underlying blue bag is a sterilization pouch for the metal tools. [...] The tube (center left) was used for metzitzah ...|$|E
2500|$|... "A large shapeless figure [...] a pile {{of white}} hair {{dominated}} by a bun on the top, which usually <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> {{to the side of}} her head {{by the end of the}} day," [...] Fine was, despite her appearance, a loved and respected figure. [...] John Finley, editor of The New York Times during the 1910s, wrote of her, [...] "So was the school under her wise and gentle rule a place where happy children grew into her spirited likeness." [...] Fine retired in 1931 and died two years later.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Blucher, biographer of Tim Horan and Jason Little, {{documented}} {{the second half}} of Australia's pool match against Argentina in Perfect Union, by writing that, [...] "Midway through the second half, the Argentine Pumas had clawed back to within four points, trailing 20-16... The Wallabies posted a further 12 points in the closing stages to win by the comfortable through not entirely convincing margin of 32-19." [...] Blucher further documented that, [...] "Horan helped himself to two tries at Llanelli, the second five minutes from fulltime, an early dividend from his policy of following Campese... In the 75th minute of the Cup, when he <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> beside the right hand upright for his second try...|$|E
60|$|Then amid a {{cloud of}} dust Paul <b>slid</b> in <b>over</b> the home plate while Sam, having reached second, was legging it rapidly for third. Up came the ball from the field to second, and then to third, but before it got there the {{youngest}} Rover was safely clutching the bag.|$|R
60|$|The dark shore loomed {{closer to}} the south as Jane Clayton, Lady Greystoke, <b>slid</b> quietly <b>over</b> {{the stern of the}} canoe into the chill waters of the lake. She {{scarcely}} moved other than to keep her nostrils above the surface while the canoe was yet discernible in the last rays of the declining moon. Then she struck out toward the southern shore.|$|R
25|$|Arrowheads may be {{attached}} to the shaft with a cap, a socketed tang, or inserted into a split in the shaft and held by a process called hafting. Points attached with caps are simply <b>slid</b> snugly <b>over</b> the end of the shaft, or may be held on with hot glue. Split-shaft construction involves splitting the arrow shaft lengthwise, inserting the arrowhead, and securing it using a ferrule, sinew, or wire.|$|R
2500|$|Carburis {{directed}} workmen to {{wait for}} winter, when the ground was frozen, and then had them drag the large stone over the frozen ground to the sea for shipment and transport to the city. He developed a metallic sledge that <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> bronze [...] about 13.5cm (6inches) in diameter, over a track. The process worked in a way similar to the later invention of ball bearings. Making the feat even more impressive was that the labour was done entirely by humans; no animals or machines were used in bringing the stone from the original site to the Senate Square. After Carburis devised the method, it took 400 men nine months to move the stone, during which time master stonecutters continuously shaped the enormous granite monolith. Catherine periodically visited the effort to oversee their progress. The larger capstans was turned by 32 men, this just barely moving the rock. A further complication was the availability of only 100 m of track, {{which had to be}} constantly disassembled and relaid. Nevertheless, the workers made over 150 m of progress a day while on level ground. Upon arrival at the sea an enormous barge was constructed exclusively for the Thunder Stone. The vessel had to be supported on either side by two full-size warships. After a short voyage, the stone reached its destination in 1770, after nearly two years of work. A medal was issued to commemorate its arrival, with the legend [...] "Close to Daring".|$|E
60|$|And he {{carefully}} took the pins {{out of the}} knot, and the rush of hair, of uniform dark brown, <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> the humped back.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Polteed smiled, {{as though}} saying, 'You are {{teaching}} your grandmother, my dear sir;' {{and his eyes}} <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> Soames' face for one unprofessional instant.|$|E
50|$|Following {{negotiations}} between the two participating groups, a Unity Convention of the NSL and <b>SLID</b> was held <b>over</b> the Christmas holidays at the YMCA building in Columbus, Ohio. The American Student Union was thus born.|$|R
6000|$|... "Descend!" [...] snapped Tarzan, {{raising the}} point of his spear. He knew that the man lied and was not {{surprised}} that he did. A man who would murder for no cause would lie for less. Schneider still hesitated and pled. The ape-man jabbed him with the spear and Schneider <b>slid</b> fearfully <b>over</b> the top and began the perilous descent. Tarzan accompanied and assisted him over the worst places until at last they were within {{a few feet of}} the bottom.|$|R
60|$|Courbertin saw the {{left-hand}} channel close, {{and then a}} great white barrier heave up and travel from island to island. The ice before them slowed down and came to rest. Then followed the instant rise of the river. Up it came in a swift rush, as though nothing short of the sky could stop it. As {{when they were first}} awakened, the cakes rubbed and <b>slid</b> inshore <b>over</b> the crest of the bank, the muddy water creeping in advance and marking the way.|$|R
6000|$|The robot {{attendant}} <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> soundlessly, {{poised to}} take their orders. Erickson roused himself. [...] "Let's see," [...] he murmured. [...] "What will we have? Mara?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{his right}} hand <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> the ends of a bush growing out of a fissure. He caught the bush and held on like grim death.|$|E
60|$|Through {{the thin}} veil of moonlit mist that <b>slid</b> <b>over</b> the {{hillside}} {{we could see}} an army of rabbits bunched up, or hopping a few paces forward, feeding.|$|E
60|$|Frank, who {{had been}} heaving the sawed trunks {{on top of one}} another with Jake, agreed with the rancher. The big masses of timber <b>slid</b> easily <b>over</b> the snow and they were clean to handle, which was {{something}} to be thankful for after the difficulty they had had in moving them when they were foul with clotted mire. The frost, as he had discovered, seldom lasted long in that country, but it was very cold and the firs towered flecked with snow against a clear blue sky.|$|R
50|$|The ELLI has {{a shorter}} history, {{but it still}} {{completely}} captures the supercharged rise of the European loan index in the {{years leading up to}} the credit crunch, as well as the subsequent fall to earth. Between 2002 and 2007, the average price on the ELLI never fell below 94.82 and even peaked over par at 100.91. With the onset of the credit crunch in 2008, pricing <b>slid</b> and <b>over</b> the past two years, the price has fallen as low as 59.05 and has not made it back to par.|$|R
50|$|On lap 8, Bruno Senna {{tried to}} pass Paul di Resta on the outside going into the second chicane. Di Resta moved over, forcing Senna onto the gravel. Senna went {{straight}} through the chicane and back onto the racing line {{right in front of}} Mark Webber, who dodged around him as they entered the first Lesmo corner. On the next lap, Jean-Éric Vergne had a right rear suspension failure under braking into the first chicane. He spun and <b>slid</b> sideways <b>over</b> one of the curbs, launching his car into the air over the chicane.|$|R
