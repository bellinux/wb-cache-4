50|$|The pre-war <b>Sejm</b> <b>Hotel</b> {{became too}} crowded across the years. The New House for Members of the Sejm was {{constructed}} {{on the basis}} of architect Małgorzata Handzelewicz-Wacławek's designs, with the cooperation of Andrzej Kaliszewski. The building was commissioned for use in the spring of 1989.|$|E
50|$|The former <b>Sejm</b> <b>Hotel,</b> {{now called}} the Old House for Members of the Sejm, was erected {{according}} {{to the design of}} Kazimierz Skórewicz. On the north side, the central axis of the building is characterised by a flat break with an oval corner. This building is connected to the Sejm Meeting Hall by a floor connector on the first floor, preserving the original balustrade attic. After the Second World War the longer wing of the hotel was extended southward, in accordance to Bohdan Pniewski's designs. Thus, an inner courtyard was created in front of the hotel, where the gates from Wiejska and Górnośląska Street are leading towards. Pniewski stylised the oval corner of the building into a cylindrical tower.|$|E
