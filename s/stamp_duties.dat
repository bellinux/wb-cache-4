Because of the inefficiencies and inequalities of <b>stamp</b> <b>duty</b> the report also explores alternatives to the current system.

The purpose of our report is to consider the economic rationale lying behind <b>stamp</b> <b>duty.</b> We have three broad main aims: •to consider how <b>stamp</b> <b>duty</b> measures up to general principles of optimal taxation, •to consider and quantify, where possible, the effects of <b>stamp</b> <b>duty</b> on the housing market and wider economy, •to discuss meaningful revenue-neutral alternatives to the current regime. ...|$|R

The authors examine {{the response of the}} equity market to announcements of changes in <b>stamp</b> <b>duty</b> rates and compare the prices of two assets which are similar in all respects apart from their treatment for <b>stamp</b> <b>duty</b> purposes: American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) and their London Stock Exchange-traded stocks. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that <b>stamp</b> <b>duty</b> is capitalised in prices. Using univariate GARCH models, the authors find that <b>stamp</b> <b>duty</b> has no effect on volatility, contradicting the key hypothesis put forward by proponents of transaction taxes. ...|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the case of}} UK stamp duty reserve tax shows that {{provided}} exemptions are given to market makers and banks, that FTT can generate modest revenues, {{at the expense of}} pensioners and savers. Despite the low tax rate of 0.5% on the purchase of shares, the UK managed to generate between €3.7 and €7.4 billion in revenues from <b>stamp</b> <b>duties</b> per year throughout the last decade. Also the cases of Japan, Taiwan and Switzerland suggest that countries may generate sizable amounts of income by introducing FTT on a national scale. If implemented on an international scale, revenues may be even considerably higher, since it would {{make it more difficult for}} traders to avoid the tax by moving to other locations.|$|E

After weeks of intense media and public pressure, the New South Wales State Government announced in its budget that it would reduce stamp duty and land tax, but critics argued that the State Government did not go far enough with much broader tax reform in New South Wales required to help encourage investment and business that had been forced elsewhere due to an unfavourable New South Wales business environment. This was in response to the Commonwealth allowing another A$72 million in grants to New South Wales, in addition to existing annual increases.|$|E
2500|$|Debate in {{the colonies}} had {{actually}} begun {{in the spring of}} 1764 over the Stamp Act when Parliament passed a resolution that contained the assertion, [...] "That, towards further defraying the said Expences, it may be proper to charge certain <b>Stamp</b> <b>Duties</b> in the said Colonies and Plantations." [...] Both the Sugar Act and the proposed Stamp Act were designed principally to raise revenue from the colonists. [...] The Sugar Act, to a large extent, was a continuation of past legislation related primarily to the regulation of trade (termed an external tax), but its stated purpose was entirely new: to collect revenue directly from the colonists for a specific purpose. [...] The novelty of the Stamp Act was that it was the first internal tax (a tax based entirely on activities with{{in the colonies}}) levied directly on the colonies by Parliament. It was judged by the colonists to be a more dangerous assault on their rights than the Sugar Act was, because of its potential wide application to the colonial economy.|$|E

(c) Foreign Securities.--Prior to {{the census}} of foreign {{securities}} {{carried out by}} the German Government in September, 1916,[121] of which the exact results have not been made public, no official return of such investments was ever called for in Germany, and the various unofficial estimates are confessedly based on insufficient data, such as the admission of foreign securities to the German Stock Exchanges, the receipts of the <b>stamp</b> <b>duties,</b> consular reports, etc. The principal German estimates current before the war are given in the appended footnote.[122] This shows a general consensus of opinion among German authorities that their net foreign investments were upwards of $6,250,000,000. I take this figure as the basis of my calculations, although I believe it to be an exaggeration; $5,000,000,000 would probably be a safer figure.|$|E
60|$|A {{certain amount}} of revenue may, as we have seen, be {{obtained}} without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent. Besides (1) the land-tax,(346) and (2) an equivalent for the revenue derived from <b>stamp</b> <b>duties</b> on the conveyance of land, some further taxation might, I have contended, at some future period be imposed, (3) to enable the state {{to participate in the}} progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes. (4) Legacies and inheritances, we have also seen, ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue. With these taxes, and (5) a house-tax of suitable amount, we should, I think, have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation. The remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption, and the question is, which of these are the least objectionable.|$|E

I do not look upon the Act of 1844 as the end of legislation in currency; but this subject is a big one. Scotch and Irish notes would be hard to deal with until the English case is disposed of. I forget whether we have abolished the last of the restrictions on newspapers. If not, they deserve to be taken in hand, according to me. I have always wished to equalise the outgoings of the exchequer as much as possible over the several weeks of the year. Few incomes admit of this advantage in the same degree as the public income. It would make our “account” much more valuable to our bankers; therefore to us.|$|E

6000|$|Thus constituted, with {{an immense}} body of natural means, which are lessened in their amount {{only to be}} {{increased}} in their effect, France has, since the accomplishment of the Revolution, a complete unity in its direction.

The advantages of Nature in some measure remain; even these, I admit, are astonishingly lessened; the command over what remains is complete and absolute. We go about asking when assignats will expire, and we laugh at the last price of them. But what signifies the fate of those tickets of despotism? The despotism will find despotic means of supply.

In order to deal with the knowledge gaps, this study uses the legal historical method and the legal comparative method to reconstruct an interpretation of <b>stamp</b> <b>duty</b> legal history for investigation. The study reveals that the first imposition of the tax was driven by the primary imperative to raise revenue followed by a secondary demand for social equity. It also reveals that the provisions of the first Hong Kong <b>stamp</b> <b>duty</b> legislation were influenced by local political demands occasioned by events leading to the American Revolution in the eighteenth century. The study demonstrates that, along with the dominant financial impetus, other social, economic, political, sustainability and pragmatic forces also shaped the <b>stamp</b> <b>duty</b> system under British rule. Social and economic forces supplemented the financial impetus from the 1960 s onwards as key drivers for <b>stamp</b> <b>duty</b> legislative change. The study examines the explicit and discerned objectives of various historical Hong Kong Stamp Ordinances in terms of the actual outcomes. The analysis reveals many novel lessons in <b>stamp</b> <b>duty</b> system design.
