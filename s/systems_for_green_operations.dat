40|$|From 9 - 26 October 2015 the Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR) in {{cooperation}} with Delft University of Technology (DUT) has executed Clean Sky flight trials with the Cessna Citation II research aircraft. The trials consisted of several descents and approaches at the Eelde airport near Groningen, demonstrating the TEMO (Time and Energy Managed Operations) concept developed in the Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative research programme {{as part of the}} <b>Systems</b> <b>for</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Operations</b> (SGO) Integrated Technology Demonstrator. A TEMO descent aims to achieve an energy-managed idle-thrust continuous descent operation (CDO) while satisfying ATC time constraints, to maintain runway throughput. An optimal descent plan is calculated with an advanced on-board real-time aircraft trajectory optimisation algorithm considering forecasted weather and aircraft performance. The optimised descent plan was executed using the speed-on-elevator mode of an experimental Fly-By-Wire (FBW) system connected to the pitch servo motor of the Cessna Citation II aircraft.

In particular, the paper focuses on Carbon Dioxide (CO 2), {{which is the}} most important aviation greenhouse gas, and whose column density data can be used for environmental monitoring purposes and to support the development and validation of aircraft engines and <b>Systems</b> <b>for</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Operations</b> (SGO). The proposed measurement techniques are based on a near-infrared bistatic Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system using {{a modified version of the}} Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) technique currently adopted in state-of-the-art (monostatic) remote sensing LIDARs. Target surfaces of known spectral reflectance and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) are irradiated with two laser beams of appropriate wavelengths. The first wavelength is selected in coincidence with one vibrational band of the CO 2 molecule, exhibiting significant absorption phenomena (absorption line). The second wavelength is selected in the same transmission window but outside the absorption line. By measuring the difference in incident energy between the two beams, and inverting the differential transmittance models, it is possible to determine the pollutant column density. Parasite effects include haze, precipitation and dust particulate, which can be modelled as well. In addition to the bistatic LIDAR technique, a monostatic control technique is also proposed in this paper for experimental and calibration purposes...|$|E

40|$|The {{aviation}} industry is currently experiencing a {{growth rate of}} about 4 % per annum and this trend {{is expected to continue}} into the future. One concern about this growth rate is the impact it will have on the environment particularly in terms of emissions of CO 2, NOx and relatively recently also cirrus clouds induced by contrails. The ACARE has set emissions reduction targets of 50 % reduction of CO 2 and noise and 80 % reduction of NOx by 2020 relative to Y 2000 technology. Clean Sky and other large EU collaborative projects have been launched in an effort to identify new, more efficient, aircraft and engine technologies, greener operational and asset management practices and lower life cycle emissions. This PhD research was funded by and contributed to the <b>Systems</b> <b>for</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Operations</b> Integrated Technology Demonstrator (SGO-ITD) of the Clean Sky project. The key contribution to knowledge of this research is the development and application of a methodology for simultaneous optimisation of aircraft trajectories and engine cycles. Previous studies on aircraft trajectory optimisation studies, published in the public domain, are based on relatively low fidelity models. The case studies presented in this thesis are multi-objective and based on higher fidelity, verified aircraft, engine and emissions models and also include assessments of conceptual engines with conceptual LPP combustors. The first task involved the development of reactor based NOx emission prediction models for a conventional aero gas turbine combustor and a novel conceptual lean pre-mixed pre-vaporised combustor. A persistent contrails prediction model was also developed. A multi-disciplinary framework comprising a genetic algorithm based optimiser integrated with an engine performance, an aircraft performance and an emission prediction model was then developed. The framework was initially used to perform multi-disciplinary aircraft trajectory optimisation studies and subsequently both aircraft trajectory and engine cycle optimisation studies simultaneously to assess trade-offs between mission fuel burn, flight time, NOx production and persistent contrails formation [...] .

40|$|Global {{aviation}} {{is growing}} exponentially {{and there is}} a great emphasis on trajectory optimization to reduce the overall environmental impact caused by aircraft. Many optimization techniques exist and are being studied for this purpose. The CLEAN SKY Joint Technology Initiative for aeronautics and Air transport, a European research activity run under the Seventh Framework program, is a collaborative initiative involving industry, research organizations and academia to introduce novel technologies to improve the environmental impact of aviation. As part of the overall research activities, "green" aircraft trajectories are addressed in the <b>Systems</b> <b>for</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Operations</b> (SGO) Integrated Technology Demonstrator. This paper studies the impact of large commercial aircraft trajectories optimized for different objectives applied to the on board systems. It establishes integrated systems models for both conventional and more electric secondary power systems and studies the impact of fuel, noise, time and emissions optimized trajectories on each configuration. It shows the significant change in the fuel burn due to systems operation and builds up the case as to why a detailed aircraft systems model is required within the optimization loop. Typically, the objective in trajectory optimization is to improve the mission performance of an aircraft or reduce the environmental impact. Hence parameters such as time, fuel burn, emissions and noise are key optimization objectives. In most instances, trajectory optimization is achieved by using models that represent such parameters. For example aircraft dynamics models to describe the flight performance, engine models to calculate the fuel burn, emissions and noise impact, etc. Such techniques have proved to achieve the necessary level of accuracy in trajectory optimization. This research enhances previous techniques by adding in the effect of systems power in the optimization process. A comparison is also made between conventional power systems and more electric architectures. In the conventional architecture, the environmental control system and the ice protection system are powered by engine bleed air while actuators and electrics are powered by engine shaft power off-takes. In the more electric architecture, bleed off take is eliminated and the environmental control system and ice protection system are also powered electrically through engine shaft power off takes...|$|E
40|$|Cross-positioned {{within the}} Clean Sky Programme, the Technology Evaluator (TE) is a {{dedicated}} evaluation platform. It has the key role of assessing {{the environmental impact}} of the technologies developed in Clean Sky and their level of success towards the ACARE environmental goals. TE assessments consider all promising green technologies selected by Clean Sky´s ITDs (Integrated Technology Demonstrator platforms) in which these technologies are developed and clustered in coherent and mutually compatible solution sets, identifying optimized new future aircraft solutions. The ITDs are: •	Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft (SFWA) addressing large aircraft technologies •	Green Regional Aircraft (GRA) addressing regional aircraft technologies •	Green Rotorcraft (GRC) addressing rotorcraft technologies •	Sustainable And Green Engines (SAGE) addressing engine technologies •	<b>Systems</b> <b>for</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Operations</b> (SGO) addressing aircraft systems The ITD technologies are integrated into simplified conceptual aircraft performance models in order to evaluate the Clean Sky technology solution sets at aircraft level. These aircraft are named Clean Sky concept aircraft.

To this end a Clean Sky concept aircraft and its reference technology aircraft are compared along the same reference trajectory {{in order to determine the}} environmental benefit of the Clean Sky technologies. The main environmental indicators considered are noise on ground, fuel burn and emissions (CO 2 and NOX). •	Airport level At airport level the environmental impact on local communities around an airport is assessed. To this end a year 2020 airport traffic scenario with reference technology aircraft is compared with the same traffic scenario but in which Clean Sky concept aircraft replace their reference technology counterpart. The main metrics at airport level are noise on the ground, population impacted by certain noise levels, and emissions (CO 2 and NOX). •	Air transport system (ATS) level At ATS level {{the environmental impact of}} Clean Sky technologies is quantified at global scale.
