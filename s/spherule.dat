2500|$|C. immitis is a dimorphic {{saprophytic}} fungus {{that grows}} as a mycelium {{in the soil}} and produces a <b>spherule</b> form in the host organism. It resides in the soil {{in certain parts of}} the southwestern United States, most notably in California and Arizona. It is also commonly found in northern Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. C. immitis is dormant during long dry spells, then develops as a mold with long filaments that break off into airborne spores when it rains. [...] The spores, known as arthroconidia, are swept into the air by disruption of the soil, such as during construction, farming, or an earthquake. Windstorms may also cause epidemics far from endemic areas.

2500|$|It must rain {{first to}} start the cycle of initial growth of the fungus {{underneath}} the soil. [...] In soil (and in agar media), Coccidioides exist in filament form. It forms hyphae in both horizontal and vertical directions. Over a prolonged dry period, cells within hyphae degenerate to form alternating barrel-shaped cells (arthroconidia). Arthroconidia are light-weight and carried by air currents. This happens when the soil is disturbed often by clearing trees, construction and farming. [...] As the population grows, so have all these industries, causing a potential cascade effect. [...] The more land that is cleared, the more arid the soil, the riper the environment for Coccidioides. [...] These spores can be easily inhaled without the person knowing. On arriving in alveoli, they enlarge in size to become spherules, and internal septations develop. This division of cells is {{made possible by the}} optimal temperature inside the body. [...] Septations develop and form endospores within the <b>spherule.</b> Rupture of spherules release these endospores, which in turn repeat the cycle and spread the infection to adjacent tissues within the body of the infected individual. [...] Nodules can form in lungs surrounding these spherules. When they rupture, they release their contents into bronchi, forming thin-walled cavities. These cavities can result in symptoms like characteristic chest pain, coughing up blood, and persistent cough. In individuals with a weakened immune system, the infection can spread through the blood. [...] On rare occasion it can enter the body through a break in the skin, causing infection.|$|E

A tree differs from a seed immeasurably in every respect--in bulk, in structure, in colour, in form, in chemical composition: differs so greatly that no visible resemblance of any kind can be pointed out between them. Yet is the one changed {{in the course of}} a few years into the other: changed so gradually, that at no moment can it be said--Now the seed ceases to be, and the tree exists. What can be more widely contrasted than a newly-born child and the small, semi-transparent <b>spherule</b> constituting the human ovum? The infant is so complex in structure that a cyclopædia is needed to describe its constituent parts. The germinal vesicle is so simple that it may be defined in a line. Nevertheless a few months suffice to develop the one out of the other; and that, too, by a series of modifications so small, that were the embryo examined at successive minutes, even a microscope would with difficulty disclose any sensible changes. That the uneducated and the ill-educated should think the hypothesis that all races of beings, man inclusive, may in process of time have been evolved from the simplest monad, a ludicrous one, is not to be wondered at. But for the physiologist, who knows that every individual being is so evolved--who knows, further, that in their earliest condition the germs of all plants and animals whatever are so similar, [...] "that there is no appreciable distinction amongst them, which would enable it to be determined whether a particular molecule is the germ of a Conferva or of an Oak, of a Zoophyte or of a Man;"[1]--for him to make a difficulty of the matter is inexcusable.

60|$|This {{propriety of}} bodies, as I think {{it the most}} worthy, and next {{in order to be}} consider'd after the contemplation of the Globular Figure, so have I long had a desire as wel as a {{determination}} to have prosecuted it if I had had an opportunity, having long since propos'd to my self the method of my enquiry therein, it containing all the allurements that I think any enquiry is capable of: For, first I take it to proceed from the most simple principle that any kind of form can come from, next the Globular, which was therefore the first I set upon, and what I have therein perform'd, I leave the Judicious Reader to determine. For as that form proceeded from a propiety of fluid bodies, which I have call'd Congruity, or Incongruity; so I think, had I time and opportunity, I could make probable, that all these regular Figures that are so conspicuously various and curious, and do so adorn and beautifie such multitudes of bodies, as I have above hinted, arise onely from three or four several positions or postures of Globular particles, and those the most plain, obvious, and necessary conjunctions of such figur'd particles that are possible, so that supposing such and such plain and obvious causes concurring the coagulating particles must necessarily compose a body of such a determinate regular Figure, and no other, and this with as much necessity and obviousness as a fluid body encompast with a Heterogeneous fluid must be protruded into a <b>Spherule</b> or Globe. And this I have ad oculum demonstrated with a company of bullets, and some few other very simple bodies; so that there was not any regular Figure, which I have hitherto met withall, of any of those bodies that I have above named, that I could not with the composition of bullets or globules, and one or two other bodies, imitate, even almost by shaking them together. And thus for instance may we find that the Globular bullets will of themselves, if put on an inclining plain, so that they may run together, naturally run into a triangular order, composing all the variety of figures that can be imagin'd to be made out of æquilateral triangles; and such will you find, upon trial, all the Surfaces of Alum to be compos'd of: For three bullets lying on a plain, as close to one another as they can compose an æquilatero-triangular form, as in A in the 7. Scheme. If a fourth be joyn'd to them on either side as closely as it can, they four compose the most regular Rhombus consisting of two æquilateral triangles, as B. If a fifth be joyn'd to them on either side in as close a position as it can, which is the propriety of the Texture, it makes a Trapezium, or four-sided Figure, two of whole angles are 120. and two 60. degrees, as C. If a sixth be added, as before, either it makes an æquilateral triangle, as D, or a Rhomboeid, as E, or an Hex-angular Figure, as F, which is compos'd of two primary Rhombes. If a seventh be added, it makes either an æquilatero-hexagonal Figure, as G, or some kind of six-sided Figure, as H, or I. And though there be never so many placed together, they may be rang'd into some of these lately mentioned Figures, all the angles of which will be either 60. degrees, or 120. as the figure K. which is an æquiangular hexagonal Figure is compounded of 12. Globules, or may be of 25, or 27, or 36, or 42, &c. and by these kinds of texture, or position of globular bodies, may you find out all the variety of regular shapes, into which the smooth surfaces of Alum are form'd, as upon examination any one may easily find; nor does it hold only in superficies, but in solidity also, for it's obvious that a fourth Globule laid upon the third in this texture, composes a regular Tetrahedron, which is a very usual Figure of the Crystals of Alum. And (to hasten) there is no one Figure into which Alum is observ'd to be crystallized, but may by this texture of Globules be imitated, and by no other.|$|E
50|$|Gerta Keller, however, {{suggests}} that the Chicxulub impact occurred approximately 300,000 years before the K-Pg boundary.

As the result, key beds often can be used for both mapping and correlating sedimentary rocks and dating them. Volcanic ash beds (tonsteins and bentonite beds) and impact <b>spherule</b> beds, and specific megaturbidites are types of key beds created by instantaneous events. The widespread accumulation of distinctive sediments over a geologically short period of time have created key beds in the form of peat beds, coal beds, shell beds, marine bands, black shales in cyclothems, and oil shales. A well-known example of a key bed is the global layer of iridium-rich impact ejecta that marks the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (K-T boundary).|$|E
40|$|The morphological, mineralogical, and {{chemical}} characteristics of silicate and glassy <b>spherules</b> {{from a number}} of new localities in the Transantarctic Mountains were determined. The results indicate that these Antarctic <b>spherules</b> are of extraterrestrial origin. It is concluded that they, most likely, represent individual micrometeorites that melted during passage through the atmosphere; alternatively, they may be ablation <b>spherules...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{compositions}} and mineralogy of metal-sulfide <b>spherules</b> {{trapped in}} ureilites are studied. Electron microprobe analyses of metallic phases and sulfides in <b>spherules</b> were conducted and backscattered electron images of metallic <b>spherules</b> in olivine and in ureilites are presented. It is {{observed that the}} <b>spherules</b> are composed of cohenite, Fe-Ni metal, troilite, and rare phosphorus-bearing minerals. The intergranular metal and graphite in the ureilites are analyzed. The phase relations of cohenite-bearing <b>spherules</b> are considered. <b>Spherules</b> represent Fe-Ni-C-S alloys that exist as immiscible metallic liquid droplets in the silicate magma from which ureilite olivine and pigeonite crystallized. The data reveal that graphite crystals occur as inclusions in olivine and ureilites and therefore graphite in ureilites is a primary magnetic component. It is hypothesized that graphite is a residue from the solid source materials that melted to produce the ureilite parent magma or crystallized from the magma...|$|R
40|$|New geochemical data on cosmic <b>spherules</b> (187 major element, 76 trace element, and 10 oxygen isotope compositions) and 273 {{analyses}} {{from the}} literature {{were used to assess}} the chemical diversity observed among glass cosmic <b>spherules</b> with chondritic composition. Three chemical groups of glass <b>spherules</b> are identified: normal chondritic <b>spherules,</b> CAT-like <b>spherules</b> (where CAT refers to Ca-Al-Ti-rich <b>spherules),</b> and high Ca-Al <b>spherules.</b> The transition from normal to high Ca-Al <b>spherules</b> occurs through a progressive enrichment in refractory major elements (on average from 2. 3 wt. % to 7. 0 wt. % for CaO, 2. 8 wt. % to 7. 2 wt. % for Al(2) O(3), and 0. 14 wt. % to 0. 31 wt. % for TiO(2)) and refractory trace elements (from 6. 2 mu g/g to 19. 3 mu g/g for Zr and 1. 6 CI- 4. 3 CI for Rare Earth Elements-REEs) relative to moderately refractory elements (Mg, Si) and volatile elements (Rb, Na, Zn, Pb). Based on a comparison with experimental works {{from the literature}}, these chemical groups are thought to record progressive heating and evaporation during atmospheric entry. The evaporative mass losses evaluated for the high Ca-Al group (80 - 90 %) supersede those of the CAT <b>spherules</b> which up to now have been considered as the most heated class of stony cosmic <b>spherules.</b> However, glass cosmic <b>spherules</b> still retain isotopic and elemental evidence of their source and precursor mineralogy. Four out of the 10 normal and high Ca-Al <b>spherules</b> analysed for oxygen isotopes are related to ordinary chondrites (delta(18) O = 13. 2 - 17. 3 parts per thousand and delta(17) O = 7. 6 - 9. 2 parts per thousand). They are systematically enriched in Ni and Co (Ni = 24 - 500 mu g/g) with respect to <b>spherules</b> related to carbonaceous chondrites (Ni < 1. 2 mu g/g, delta(18) O = 13. 1 - 28. 0 parts per thousand and delta(17) O = 5. 1 - 14. 0 parts per thousand). REE abundances in cosmic <b>spherules,</b> which are not fractionated according to parent body or atmospheric entry heating, can then be used to unravel the precursor mineralogy. <b>Spherules</b> with flat REE pattern close to unity when normalized to CI are the most abundant in our dataset (54 %) and likely derive from homogeneous, fine-grained chondritic precursors. Other REE patterns fall into no more than five categories, a surprising reproducibility in view of the mineralogical heterogeneity of chondritic lithologies at the micrometeorite scale...|$|R
