In March 2014 KiwiRail reported that tests had shown small (5%) amounts of white asbestos in a <b>soundproofing</b> <b>compound</b> in five locomotives, with no asbestos in the remaining 34, and with no airborne asbestos or asbestos dust found. It was reported that the risk from asbestos was minimal and that levels of asbestos were insignificant. An asbestos removal plan was instigated and the first locomotive was returned to service in April 2014. The second generation locomotives were {{to be returned to}} service during April 2014, and were expected to have all asbestos removed over the following 12 months; the first generation units were to remain out of service until all asbestos containing materials were removed.|$|E
