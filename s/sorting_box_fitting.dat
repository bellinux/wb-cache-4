40|$|Detection of {{vehicles}} in crowded 3 -D urban scenes is a challenging problem in many computer vision related research fields, such as robot perception, autonomous driving, self-localization, and mapping. In this paper {{we present a}} model-based approach to solve the recognition problem from 3 -D range data. In particular, we aim to detect and recognize vehicles from continuously streamed LIDAR point cloud sequences of a rotating multi-beam laser scanner. The end-to-end pipeline of our framework working on the raw streams of 3 -D urban laser data consists of three steps 1) producing distinct groups of points which represent different urban objects 2) extracting reliable 3 -D shape descriptors specifically designed for vehicles, considering the need for fast processing speed 3) executing binary classification on the extracted descriptors in order to perform vehicle detection. The extraction of our efficient shape descriptors provides a significant speedup with and increased detection accuracy compared to a PCA based 3 -D bounding <b>box</b> <b>fitting</b> method used as baseline...|$|R

We demonstrate the application of topological analysis techniques to the rather unexpected domain of software visualization. We collect a memory reference trace from a running program, recasting the linear flow of trace records as a high-dimensional point cloud in a metric space. We use topological persistence to automatically detect significant circular structures in the point cloud, which represent recurrent or cyclical runtime program behaviors. We visualize such recurrences using radial plots to display their time evolution, offer-ing multi-scale visual insights, and detecting potential candidates for memory performance optimization. We then present several case studies to demonstrate some key insights obtained using our techniques...|$|R

40|$|Colloque avec actes et comité de lecture. internationale. International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an original approach of safe control synthesis for manufacturing systems controlled by Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). In this work, manufacturing systems are considered as Discrete Event Systems (DES) with logical Inputs (sensors) and logical Outputs (actuators). The proposed approach, which separates the functional control {{part from the}} safety control part, is easy to implement and guarantees that the designed controller is safe. The methodology {{is based on the}} use of safety constraints in order to design a safe permissive controller. This controller is then constrained by functional constraints. The approach is illustrated with a <b>sorting</b> <b>boxes</b> simulated process using the ITS PLC software from the Real Games Company (www. realgames. pt). The control algorithm is presented in details in the paper. This approach can be used with an existing PLC program in order to guarantee its safety. However, it also allows to result in a safe control, may be simpler than a conventional approach based on a complete specification for instance in GRAFCET (IEC 60848) that does not distinguish the functional aspect from the safety aspect...|$|R
40|$|A linear-scaling {{implementation}} of Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham self-consistent field SCF theories is presented and illustrated with applications to molecules consisting {{of more than}} 1000 atoms. The diagonalization bottleneck of traditional SCF methods is avoided by carrying out a minimization of the Roothaan-Hall RH energy function and solving the Newton equations using the preconditioned conjugate-gradient PCG method. For rapid PCG convergence, the Löwdin orthogonal atomic orbital basis is used. The resulting linear-scaling trust-region Roothaan-Hall LS-TRRH method works {{by the introduction of}} a level-shift parameter in the RH Newton equations. A great advantage of the LS-TRRH method is that the optimal level shift can be determined at no extra cost, ensuring fast and robust convergence of both the SCF iterations and the level-shifted Newton equations. For density averaging, the authors use the trust-region density-subspace minimization TRDSM method, which, unlike the traditional direct inversion in the iterative subspace DIIS scheme, is firmly based on the principle of energy minimization. When combined with a linear-scaling evaluation of the Fock/Kohn-Sham matrix including a <b>boxed</b> <b>fitting</b> of the electron density, LS-TRRH and TRDSM methods constitute the linear-scaling trust-region SCF LS-TRSCF method. The LS-TRSCF method compares favorably with the traditional SCF/ DIIS scheme, converging smoothly and reliably in cases where the latter method fails. In one case where the LS-TRSCF method converges smoothly to a minimum, the SCF/DIIS method converges to a saddle point...|$|R
