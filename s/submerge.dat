5|$|Crocodilians are {{generally}} polygynous, and individual males try {{to mate with}} as many females as they can. Monogamous pairings have been recorded in American alligators. Dominant male crocodilians patrol and defend territories which contain several females. Males of some species, like the American alligator, try to attract females with elaborate courtship displays. During courtship, crocodilian males and females may rub against each other, circle around, and perform swimming displays. Copulation typically occurs in the water. When a female is ready to mate, she arches her back while her head and tail <b>submerge.</b> The male rubs across the female's neck and then grasps her with his hindlimbs, placing his tail underneath hers so their cloacas align and his penis can be inserted. Mating can last up to 15 minutes, during which time the pair continuously <b>submerge</b> and surface. While dominant males usually monopolise reproductive females, multiple paternity is known to exist in American alligators, where {{as many as three}} different males may sire offspring in a single clutch. Within a month of mating, the female crocodilian begins to make a nest.|$|E
5|$|Because {{its feet}} are located so far {{back on its}} body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, but it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of {{covering}} ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea. It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may <b>submerge</b> until only its head or bill shows above {{the surface of the}} water.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Alvarez {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory (MIT), where he {{contributed to a}} number of World War II radar projects, from early {{improvements}} to Identification friend or foe (IFF) radar beacons, now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars. Enemy submarines would wait until the radar signal was getting strong and then <b>submerge,</b> escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached the sub, the signal—as measured by the sub—got progressively weaker, and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and didn't <b>submerge.</b> The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has {{played a major role in}} aviation, most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Alvarez spent a few months at the University of Chicago working on nuclear reactors for Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos to work for Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan project. Alvarez worked on the design of explosive lenses, and the development of exploding-bridgewire detonators. As a member of Project Alberta, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress, and later the bombing of Hiroshima from the B-29 The Great Artiste.|$|E

40|$|Seed bank studies {{focused on}} <b>submerged</b> aquatic plants are {{generally}} performed under <b>submerged</b> conditions, using the seedling-emergence method. However, if a study targets at both <b>submerged</b> species and helophytes, <b>submerged</b> conditions {{are generally not}} suitable. We tested the emergence of seedlings from sediment samples from a freshwater canal, comparing a waterlogged treatment with a <b>submerged</b> treatment. From the sediment samples 31 species emerged. Eight species germinated in significantly larger numbers from the waterlogged treatment, one being a <b>submerged</b> species and four helophytes. No species germinated better under <b>submerged</b> conditions. The total number of species germinating under waterlogged conditions {{was significantly higher than}} under <b>submerged</b> conditions. Germination experiments with Potamogeton species showed no significant differences in germination percentage between a waterlogged and <b>submerged</b> treatment for at least two species. In the study of seed banks of <b>submerged</b> sediments, aimed at both <b>submerged</b> aquatic plants and helophytes, a waterlogged treatment is therefore suitable to detect both groups of plants.

50|$|<b>Submerged</b> {{specific}} gravity {{is equal to}} the {{specific gravity}} given by the ratio of the weight of the object to the weight of the fluid) minus one. That is, the object and fluid have the same density when the specific gravity equals one and the <b>submerged</b> specific gravity equals zero. This fact highlights the utility of the usage of <b>submerged</b> specific gravity in problems involving buoyancy and force balances on <b>submerged</b> objects: the object will naturally rise when its <b>submerged</b> specific gravity is negative, and sink when its <b>submerged</b> specific gravity is positive. Because of this characteristic and its dimensionless nature, <b>submerged</b> specific gravity is ubiquitous in equations of sediment transport.|$|R
5|$|In January 1940, the U-boats opened another offensive. Some 21 Submarines sank 42 ships. All were east of 11°W, {{and thus}} {{within range of}} the Command’s aircraft. The {{situation}} worsened, {{although it was not}} disastrous until after the collapse of France. The need for long-range aircraft was identified by the first success of Coastal Command. A No. 228 Squadron Sunderland sighted a U-boat, , enable to <b>submerge</b> after sinking three ships. It directed Destroyers to engage it. U-55 was scuttled.

5|$|Like {{the other}} members of its genus, the red-throated loon is well adapted to its aquatic environment: its dense bones help it to <b>submerge,</b> its legs—in their {{set-back}} position—provide excellent propulsion, and its body is long and streamlined. Even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining. Its feet are large, its front three toes are fully webbed, and its tarsus is flattened, which reduces drag and allows the leg to move easily through the water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} seismic {{response}} of <b>submerged</b> floating tunnel, a numerical model of <b>submerged</b> floating tunnel {{is set up}} based on the potential fluid theory. According to the parameters of designed <b>submerged</b> floating tunnels at home and abroad, main factors that affect the dynamic response of <b>submerged</b> floating tunnel were analyzed by numerical method. The results show that, the investigated parameters, such as tether spacing, external diameter of tube, immersion depth of tube, water depth and tube concrete thickness, have strong influence on the global behavior of the <b>submerged</b> floating tunnel. Definitely, by the caring choice of such features, {{it is possible to}} optimize the <b>submerged</b> floating tunnel structural behavior...|$|R

40|$|Respiratory {{activities}} were compared among rice seedlings germinated in air for 6 days (aerobic seedlings), those germinated under water for 5 days (<b>submerged</b> seedlings), and those grown in air for 1 day after 5 days' <b>submerged</b> germination (air-adapted seedlings). The respiratory {{activity of the}} <b>submerged</b> seedlings increased rapidly on transfer to air and reached a plateau at 16 hours in air. Respiration of the <b>submerged</b> seedlings was as sensitive to cyanide as those of aerobic and air-adapted seedlings. 2, 4 -Dinitrophenol {{had no effect on}} the respiration of the <b>submerged</b> seedlings, but stimulated those of the other two types of seedlings. Mitochondria from three types of seedlings did not differ in the ADP/O ratio and the respiratory control ratio (RCR) when succinate was oxidized. However, mitochondria from <b>submerged</b> seedlings (<b>submerged</b> mitochondria) showed poor RCR of about unity when malate was oxidized. Both the rate of succinate oxidation and succinate dehydrogenase activity were low in <b>submerged</b> mitochondria, but increased during air adaptation. Although <b>submerged</b> mitochondria oxidized malate very slowly, this activity increased after exposure to air without any increase in malate dehydrogenase activity. When NAD+ was added to <b>submerged</b> mitochondria, oxidation of malate was restored {{to the level of the}} aerobic controls. Addition of NAD+ enhanced the state 3 rate in <b>submerged</b> mitochondria, and RCR recovered to nearly the same value as that of the aerobic controls. Similar effects of NAD+ on 2 -oxoglutarate oxidation were observed. All these defects in <b>submerged</b> mitochondria were repaired during air adaptation. These results suggest that NAD+-linked substrate oxidation was low in <b>submerged</b> mitochondria because of NAD+ deficiency, and that the oxidation increased with an increasing level of NAD+ during air adaptation...|$|R

5|$|High {{rainfall}} {{can cause}} widespread flooding, {{which can lead}} to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas. Such floods cause rivers to burst their banks and <b>submerge</b> homes. The Ghaggar-Hakra River, which only flows during India's monsoon season, can flood and severely damage local crops. Floods can be exacerbated by fires during the previous dry season, which cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic, or water repellent. In various ways governments may help people deal with wet season floods. Flood plain mapping identifies which areas are more prone to flooding.

5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle is an {{opportunistic}} carnivore and consumes a {{wide variety}} of animal prey, including carrion. It often catches a fish by flying low over the water and grasping it in its talons. It prepares for the strike by holding its feet far forward (almost under its chin) and then strikes backwards while simultaneously beating its wings to lift upwards. Generally only one foot is used to seize prey. The white-bellied sea eagle may also dive at a 45 degree angle from its perch and briefly <b>submerge</b> to catch fish near the water surface. While hunting over water on sunny days, it often flies directly into the sun or at right angles to it, seemingly to avoid casting shadows over the water and hence alerting potential prey.|$|E

5|$|Another intense {{hurricane}} churned the Gulf of Mexico {{in early}} October, this time tracking from southwest to northeast. The storm moved very slowly and sank or impaired numerous ships along its course. Striking northern Florida on October 5 as {{the equivalent of}} a major hurricane, the cyclone produced extreme wind gusts to the north of its center and exceptionally high tides to the south. Extensive property in Tallahassee accounted for an estimated $500,000 (1842 USD) in losses. On Cedar Key, the storm surge demolished buildings and threatened to <b>submerge</b> the island. The storm turned northward as it entered the western Atlantic, resulting in strong winds and flooding tides in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. Later in the month, an extremely rare hurricane formed in the far eastern Atlantic, to the southwest of Madeira. This storm passed near the islands on October 27 before making landfall in southwestern Spain. Accompanied by significant damage, both along the coast and inland, this storm is considered a historical analogue to Hurricane Vince of 2005. Several other storms also had an impact on land throughout the season.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{occupy a}} wide range of habitats. Many live in leaf litter, among the stems of matted vegetation, in rotting wood, in holes in stumps, in {{cavities}} under bark, under log piles and among debris. Some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources. Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food. Most of these respire by piercing the water surface with the tip of the abdomen which acts as a snorkel, but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they <b>submerge.</b> Others live in the forest canopy where they {{may be one of the}} main types of invertebrate present.

Fresh food and water were brought aboard and the ship departed for Cape Horn, which she reached during stormy weather on 13 January 1769. Attempts to round the Cape over the next two days were unsuccessful, and Endeavour was repeatedly driven back by wind, rain and contrary tides. Cook noted that the seas off the Cape were large enough to regularly <b>submerge</b> the bow of the ship as she rode down from the crests of waves. At last, on 16 January the wind eased and the ship was able to pass the Cape and anchor in the Bay of Good Success on the Pacific coast. The crew were sent to collect wood and water, while Banks and his team gathered hundreds of plant specimens from along the icy shore. On 17 January two of Banks' servants died from cold while attempting to return to the ship during a heavy snowstorm.|$|E

5|$|In another {{patrol in}} July, U-14 sailed {{on the north}} side of the island of Corfu while headed for Santi Quaranta, Albania. Because the harbor at Corfu was {{occupied}} by the French fleet at the time, U-14 conducted a ruse de guerre by flying the submarine's former national flag, the French tricolor, in order to pass unmolested. Even though U-14s new conning tower made her look unlike any other Brumaire-class boat, one French patrol plane was successfully fooled by the ruse. When U-14s crew first spotted the aircraft, flying towards them from the direction of the sun, there was not enough time to <b>submerge.</b> As the aircraft drew near, its French markings—and its cargo of bombs—became apparent to the crew. With no other course of action possible, U-14s crew waved their hats and handkerchiefs at the plane. As the French pilot passed overhead, he returned the waves, apparently unaware of the U-boat's true nationality. The only success by U-14 on this cruise was the sinking of Marionga Goulandris, a Greek steamer, near Cape Matapan.|$|E
