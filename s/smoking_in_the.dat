5|$|The early anti-smoking {{campaign}} {{was considered a}} failure, and from 1933 to 1937 there was a rapid increase in tobacco consumption in Germany. The rate of <b>smoking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nation increased faster even than in neighboring France, where the anti-tobacco movement was tiny and far less influential. Between 1932 and 1939, per capita cigarette consumption in Germany increased from 570 to 900 per year, while the corresponding numbers for France were from 570 to 630.|$|E

The original Main Stand, boasting a press loft and a balcony above the roof, burnt down in 1921, {{and was replaced}} by the current stand before the 1922–23 campaign. The new Main Stand was split into two: the upper tier contained wooden seats, so there was a ban on <b>smoking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stand; the lower tier, which became known as the Enclosure, was terracing.|$|E
5|$|To avoid a {{potentially}} vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal {{is kept in}} an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, static electricity, and exposure to oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Anything that may contact with barium should be electrically grounded. Anyone who works with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, goggles, and a gas mask. <b>Smoking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> working area is forbidden.

5|$|Despite being {{known for}} his smoking character, Davis quit <b>smoking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s; when The X-Files started up, {{he was given a}} choice between herbal {{cigarettes}} and tobacco cigarettes. At first, he chose to use tobacco cigarettes, but switched to herbal because he was afraid of becoming addicted to them again. Davis used his notoriety on the show to assist the Canadian Cancer Society in its programs to combat smoking. In 2014, Davis donated his investments that support fossil fuels to the David Suzuki Foundation in an effort to both ethically invest, and help fund work to fight climate change. Davis is a passionate advocate for action in response to climate change, believes it is a critical issue of our time and speaks on the subject often. Taking action on a personal level, Davis drives a Tesla powered by hydroelectricity.|$|E

Appointed on the last Wednesday of each month, and meeting every Monday at 11am, the committee was responsible for imposing fines for rules violations, an obligation they met with enthusiasm. Debtors could be fined for theft; throwing water or filth out of windows or into someone else's room; making noise after midnight; cursing, fighting or singing obscene songs; <b>smoking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beer room from 8–10 am and 12–2 pm; defacing the staircase; dirtying the privy seats; stealing newspapers or utensils from the snuggery; urinating in the yard; drawing water before it had boiled; and criticizing the committee.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} rolling waves and shots of palm tree-lined roads, and gulls. A posse of skateboarders are also pictured in this scene. At first, the clip appears to {{function}} in small, romantic gestures, reminiscent {{to that of a}} fashion magazine advertisement. The singer is pictured in two visually different love affairs. In the first, Del Rey is shown clinging to a younger, long-haired blond, leather-clad man on a beach, where she narcotically flits around the Pacific Ocean shorefront, and splashes in its waves with him. At the 1:20 mark, the song and its visuals simultaneously switch up, with the singer being pictured donning diamond jewelry, sitting alongside a more mature and svengali-type man who wears sunglasses, as a chauffeured convertible barrels forward in slow motion. Del Rey's love interest in this segment recalls age disparity in sexual relationships, producer Robert Evans, and Scott Weiland. In another scene, the two are depicted nuzzling and <b>smoking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back seat of the car. Del Rey depicts a woozy and solemn persona in these segments, while the pair caress each other under passing streetlights. The clip then returns to the scene of Del Rey and her younger love interest on the beach. The aforementioned segments are intercut with scenes that appear to be shot on a low-quality camcorder.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Increases in {{taxation}} {{can contribute}} to <b>smoking</b> control. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1990 's, tobacco smuggling rates in Canada increased dramatically. Governments responded with a substantial reduction in taxes on tobacco products. This study examines {{the impact of these}} tax changes on <b>smoking</b> <b>in</b> youth in Canada. METHODS: Data on smoking from three consecutive cycles of the Canadian Community Health Surveys were combined and analyzed using a reconstructed cohort approach. Age, sex and calendar year specific rates of smoking experimentation and the onset of daily smoking were estimated for youth. Estimates apply to the entire Canadian population. RESULTS: There was a strong increase <b>in</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>in</b> youth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years following <b>the</b> reduction <b>in</b> tobacco taxes. <b>The</b> increase was stronger <b>in</b> women. <b>The</b> rates returned to pre- 1990 rates by about 2002. The number of excess daily smokers for people born between 1977 and 1985 that can be linked to the taxation reduction is about 190, 000. INTERPRETATION: There is strong evidence that reduction of tobacco taxes to combat smuggling had an adverse impact on <b>smoking</b> rates <b>in</b> youth...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>The</b> {{reduction}} <b>in</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>in</b> Australia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past 30 {{years has}} established <b>the</b> conditions <b>in</b> which elimination of smoking {{should now be}} considered. This is {{sometimes referred to as}} the 'tobacco endgame'. A range of approaches can be considered and any that are implemented would build on current actions such as plain packaging. Objective: This article outlines possible public health and policy approaches with the goal of leading to the elimination of smoking, and discusses a potential target date for <b>the</b> elimination of <b>smoking</b> <b>in</b> Australia. Discussion: <b>The</b> most effective strategy for eliminating <b>smoking</b> <b>in</b> Australia is likely to be one that reverses the tolerable, addictive nature of modern tobacco by the elimination of all additives and by specifying a very low level of true nicotine delivery. Use of an unsatisfying, costly and toxic product would naturally, and rapidly, decline. 4 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Some Islamic {{countries}} {{prohibit the}} use of alcohol (see list of countries with alcohol prohibition). Many governments levy a sin tax on alcohol and tobacco products, and restrict alcohol and tobacco from being sold or gifted to a minor.

These include the United States (1920–1933), Finland (1919–1932), Norway (1916–1927), Canada (1901–1948), Iceland (1915–1922) and the Russian Empire/USSR (1914–1925).|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} smoking {{dates back to}} as early as 5000 BCE in shamanistic rituals.

The smoking of tobacco, as well as various hallucinogenic drugs, was used to achieve trances and to come into contact with the spirit world.|$|E

AAAs {{are the most common}} form of aortic aneurysm. About 85% occur below the kidneys with the rest either at the level of or above the kidneys. In the United States, screening with ultrasound is recommended for males between 65 and 75 years of age with a history of <b>smoking.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, screening all men over 65 is recommended. Once an aneurysm is found, further ultrasounds are typically done on a regular basis.|$|E
25|$|From 1965 to 2006, {{rates of}} <b>smoking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States {{declined}} from 42% to 20.8%. The {{majority of those}} who quit were professional, affluent men. Although the per-capita number of smokers decreased, {{the average number of}} cigarettes consumed per person per day increased from 22 in 1954 to 30 in 1978. This paradoxical event suggests that those who quit smoked less, while those who continued to smoke moved to smoke more light cigarettes. The trend has been paralleled by many industrialized nations as rates have either leveled-off or declined. In the developing world, however, tobacco consumption continues to rise at 3.4% in 2002. In Africa, smoking is in most areas considered to be modern, and many of the strong adverse opinions that prevail in the West receive much less attention. Today Russia leads as the top consumer of tobacco followed by Indonesia, Laos, Ukraine, Belarus, Greece, Jordan, and China.|$|E
