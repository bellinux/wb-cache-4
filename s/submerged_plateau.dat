Four provisional dinoflagellate assemblage zones and five subzones were recognized based {{on the character of}} the dinoflagellate flora and the first/last occurrences of some key species. Isabelidinium korojonense and Nelsoniella aceras occur in Zone A together with Oligosphaeridium pulcherrimum and Trithyrodinium suspect urn. Zone B was delineated by the total range of Odontochitina cribropoda. Zone C was separated from Zone B by the presence of Satyrodinium haumuriense, and Zone D is dominated by new taxa. The dinocyst assemblages bear a strong affinity to Australian assemblages. Paleoenvironmental interpretations based mainly on dinocysts suggest that during the ?Santonian-Campanian to the Maestrichtian this portion of the Kerguelen Plateau was a shallow <b>submerged</b> <b>plateau,</b> similar to nearshore to offshore to upper slope environments with water depths of tens to hundreds of meters, but isolated from the major continents of the Southern Hemisphere. Starting perhaps in the late Cenomanian (Mohr and Gee, 1992, doi: 10. 2973 /odp. proc. sr. 120. 196. 1992), the Late Cretaceous transgression over the plateau reached its maximum during the late Campanian. The plateau may have been exposed above sea level and subjected to weathering during the latest Maestrichtian. The studied dinocyst assemblages characterized by species of Amphidiadema, Nelsoniella, Satyrodinium, and Xenikoon together with abundant Chatangiella (the large-size species) and Isabelidinium suggest that a South Indian Province (tentatively named the Helby suite) may have existed during the Campanian-Maestrichtian in comparison with the other four provinces of Lentin and Williams.

40|$|So far undescribed mosasauroid {{material}} is reported from the Turonian-Coniacian of Northern Italy (Lessini Mountains). The mosasaurs {{were collected from}} units of the Scaglia Rossa Veneta Formation, and more precisely within the lithozone informally known as the “Lastame”, an assemblage of well-bedded, reddish, often nodular marly limestones. The vertical extension of this lithozone in the area is usually less than ten meters, and has been related, {{as the rest of}} the formation, to a pelagic sedimentation on a <b>submerged</b> <b>plateau,</b> the Trento Plateau (Bosellini et al. 1978). Even if the Scaglia Rossa Veneta Formation is a unit spanning through the Turonian up to the Maastrichtian, Lozar & Grosso (1997) managed to date the “Lastame” subunit to the uppermost Turonian-Coniacian on the basis of the tintinnids and planktonic foraminifers biozones. The {{material is}} curated in two collections: The Natural History Museum in Verona and the Paleontological Museum in Sant’Anna di Alfaedo. The specimen in Verona (MCSNV V 7481) includes the right and left maxillae, the right dentary, the frontal, and the posterior end of the lower jaw (surangular + articular complex), while the specimens in Sant’Anna di Alfaedo are represented by a very well preserved but fragmentary skull (IGVR 4224), and by an almost complete but badly preserved skull and postcranial skeleton (IGVR 4301). On the basis of the unique combination of anatomical characters (e. g. tooth morphology and number, shape of the frontal, quadrate, maxillary and dentary) the preserved material cannot be directly referred to any known mosasaur species and may represent two different species and a new genus. After being compared with specimens that can be considered representative of all the different mosasaur subfamilies, these Turonian-Coniacian mosasaurs show marked anatomical similarities to the basal Russellosaurina, as for example the recently described Russellosaurus coheni Polcyn & Bell, 2005.

40|$|Uniquely in the Southern Hemisphere the New Zealand micro-continent {{spans the}} {{interface}} between a subtropical gyre and the Subantarctic Circumpolar Current. Its 20 ° latitudinal extent includes a complex of <b>submerged</b> <b>plateaux,</b> ridges, saddles and basins which, in the present interglacial, are partial barriers to circulation and steer the Subtropical (STF) and Subantarctic (SAF) fronts. This configuration offers a singular opportunity to assess the influence of bottom topography on oceanic circulation through Pleistocene glacial - interglacial (G/I) cycles, {{its effect on the}} location and strength of the fronts, and its ability to generate significant differences in mixed layer thermal history over short distances. For this study we use new planktic foraminiferal based sea-surface temperature (SST) estimates spanning the past 1 million years from a latitudinal transect of four deep ocean drilling sites. We conclude that: 1. the effect of the New Zealand landmass was to deflect the water masses south around the bathymetric impediments; 2. the effect of a shallow submerged ridge on the down-current side (Chatham Rise), was to dynamically trap the STF along its crest, {{in stark contrast to the}} usual glacial-interglacial (G-I) meridional migration that occurs in the open ocean; 3. the effect of more deeply <b>submerged,</b> downstream <b>plateaux</b> (Campbell, Bounty) was to dynamically trap the SAF along its steep southeastern margin; 4. the effects of saddles across the submarine plateaux was to facilitate the development of jets of subtropical and subantarctic surface water through the fronts, forming localized downstream gyres or eddies during different phases in the G-I climate cycles; 5. the deep Pukaki Saddle across the Campbell-Bounty Plateaux guided a branch of the SAF to flow northwards during each glacial, to form a strong gyre of circumpolar surface water in the Bounty Trough, especially during the mid-Pleistocene Climate Transition (MIS 22 - 16) when exceptionally high SST gradients existed across the STF; 6. the shallower Mernoo Saddle, at the western end of the Chatham Rise, provided a conduit for subtropical water to jet southwards across the STF in the warmest interglacial peaks (MIS 11, 5. 5) and for subantarctic water to flow northwards during glacials; 7. although subtropical or subantarctic drivers can prevail at a particular phase of a G-I cycles, it appears that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is the main influence on the regional hydrography. Thus complex submarine topography can affect distinct differences in the climate records over short distances with implications for using such records in interpreting global or regional trends. Conversely, the local topography can amplify the paleoclimate record in different ways in different places, thus enhancing its value for the study of more minor paleoceanographic influences that elsewhere are more difficult to detect. Such sites include DSDP 594, which like some other Southern Ocean sites, has the typical late Pleistocene asymmetrical saw-tooth G-I climate pattern transformed to a gap-tooth pattern of quasi-symmetrical interglacial spikes that interrupt extended periods of minimum glacial temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Younger {{sediment}} infilling open fissures exposed on the {{sea floor}} are defined as neptunian dikes. These are peculiar features of carbonate platform successions deposited along the plate margins bounding the western Tethys during the Late Triassic time. During middle-Early Jurassic, {{a large part of}} these carbonate platforms were drowned, and became <b>submerged</b> <b>plateaux</b> covered by pelagic sediments during Jurassic (“Rosso Ammonitico”) and Cretaceous times (“Scaglia”). In western Sicily, several Neptunian dikes crop out (Monte Kumeta, Rocca Busambra, Monte Maranfusa, Monte Magaggiaro, etc.). They cut across mainly the carbonate sediments of the Inici Formation and in some cases the pelagic limestone “Rosso Ammonitico”, located along the paleo-margin which separated the platform sectors of Hyblean-Saccense and Panormide domains and the basinal areas of the Imerese-Sicanian domains. In this work, we focused on the geometric, dimensional and kinematic properties of Neptunian dikes outcropping in the north-western side of Monte Maranfusa, with the aim to obtain new information relative on their formation processes. The Jurassic succession of Monte Marafusa is made up of peritidal limestones about 20 meters thick of the Inici Formation (Hettangian to Sinemurian) topped by a discontinuous thin layer (0, 5 - 1 m) of pink-white crinoidal packstone/grainstone (Pliensbachian) and, subsequently, by a 27 meter thick sequence of Rosso Ammonitico-type pelagic limestones (Toarcian to Thitonian). Within this succession, we have identified four sets of Neptunian dikes showing four main orientations: N-S, NW-SE, NE-SW and E-W. The N-S and NW-SE sets are the most developed in terms of number of dikes and relative size. In fact, the dikes show thickness up to 2 m, heights up to 10 m, and are also characterized by offsets ranging from 0. 5 to 2 m. The two other sets are oriented EW and NE-SW, respectively. The latter ones are thinner (up to 0, 2 m) than the aforementioned dike sets, show variable heights, which range from a few m up to more than 10 m, and do not show significant displacement (always less than one meter). In general, some dikes show an heterogeneous infilling consisting of upper pelagic limestone (Rosso Ammonitico and/or Scaglia) and calcite. Differently, others are filled by a homogeneous material. Ongoing research is aimed at deciphering, as far as possible, the loading conditions that led to the dikes formation, as well as the relative timing of the different dike sets...|$|R

The main objective of this thesis is to analyze cruise data obtained during the October/November 2008 ASCLME (Agulhas Somali Current Large Marine Ecosystem) cruise on board the Dr Fridtjof Nansen which surveyed the region around the Mascarene Plateau. Due to the paucity of data in the region, the cruise was a routine cruise with no specific scientific questions to be answered. A comparison is also made between sea surface temperature (SST) and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) derived currents on board to satellite estimate to possibly extend cruise results in space and time. Although the resolution of satellite estimate is low compared to cruise measurements, satellite estimate of geostrophic velocities and sea surface temperatures compare well with cruise data and can therefore be used in the region with confidence. This is invaluable since the Mascarene Plateau is relatively poorly understood and it allows us to link cruise data with Rossby waves and currents impacting the region.

40|$|The {{temporal}} relationship between tectonic and volcanic activity on passive continental margins immediately {{before and after}} the initiation of mid-ocean ridge spreading is poorly understood because of the scarcity of volcanic samples on which to perform isotope geochronology. We present the first accurate geochronological constraints from a suite of volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks dredged from the 70, 000 km² <b>submerged</b> Wallaby <b>Plateau</b> situated on the Western Australian passive margin. Plagioclase ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar and zircon U-Pb sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe ages indicate that a portion of the plateau formed at ca. 124 Ma. These ages are at least 6 m. y. younger than the oldest oceanic crust in adjacent abyssal plains (minimum = 130 Ma). Geochemical data indicate that the Wallaby Plateau volcanic samples are enriched tholeiitic basalt, similar to continental flood basalts, including the spatially and temporally proximal Bunbury Basalt in southwestern Australia. Thus, the Wallaby Plateau volcanism could be regarded as a (small) flood basalt event on the order of 10 ⁴- 10 ⁵ km³. We suggest that magma could not erupt prior to 124 Ma {{because of the lack of}} space adjacent to the plateau. Eruption was made possible at 124 Ma via the opening of the Indian Ocean during the breakup of Greater India and Australia along the Wallaby-Zenith Fracture Zone. The scale of volcanism and the temporal proximity to breakup challenges the prevailing theory that the Western Australian margin formed as a volcanic passive margin. Given that the volume of volcanism is too small for typical flood basalts associated with volcanic passive margins, we suggest that the two end members, magma-poor and volcanic passive margins, should rather be treated as a continuum. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The Early-mid Cretaceous {{marks the}} {{confluence}} of three major continental-scale events in eastern Gondwana: (1) the emplacement of a Silicic Large Igneous Province (LIP) near the continental margin; (2) the volcaniclastic fill, transgression and regression of a major epicontinental seaway developed over at least {{a quarter of the}} Australian continent; and (3) epeirogenic uplift, exhumation and continental rupturing culminating in the opening of the Tasman Basin c. 84 Ma. The Whitsunday Silicic LIP event had widespread impact, producing both substantial extrusive volumes of dominantly silicic pyroclastic material and coeval first-cycle volcanogenic sediment that accumulated within many eastern Australian sedimentary basins, and principally in the Great Australian Basin system (> 2 Mkm 3 combined volume). The final pulse of volcanism and volcanogenic sedimentation at c. 105 - 95 Ma coincided with epicontinental seaway regression, which shows a lack of correspondence with the global sea-level curve, and alternatively records a wider, continental-scale effect of volcanism and rift tectonism. Widespread igneous underplating related to this LIP event is evident from high paleogeothermal gradients and regional hydrothermal fluid flow detectable in the shallow crust and over a broad region. Enhanced CO 2 fluxing through sedimentary basins also records indirectly, large-scale, LIP-related mafic underplating. A discrete episode of rapid crustal cooling and exhumation began c. 100 - 90 Ma {{along the length of the}} eastern Australian margin, related to an enhanced phase of continental rifting that was largely amagmatic, and probably a switch from wide-more narrow rift modes.

The aims of this paper are to give the first description of this radiolarian associations, to establish a direct biochronostratigraphy by means of radiolarians, and to calibrate radiolarian biozones by ammonite zones. During Late Jurassic time, Inici Mt. area was part of a <b>submerged</b> pelagic <b>plateau</b> characterized by deposition of Rosso Ammonitico condensed facies (Rosso Ammonitico Inferiore -RAI- and Rosso Ammonitico Superiore -RAS-) and basinal facies (Rosso Ammonitico Medio -RAM-). Four stratigraphical sections from the RAM have been studied: Fornazzo Strada, Fornazzo Cava, Castello Inici and Balada di Baida. In all sections RAM consists of siliceous nodular limestone alternating with marly limestone, and moderately preserved radiolarians. Biostratigraphic correlation has been made using the Unitary Associations (UAs) method: 11 UAs have been identified and grouped in 5 biozones (Unitary Associations Zones: UAZs) whose age is calibrated by ammonites found in the same successions and/or in the under- and overlying formations. Ammonite assemblages assign the top of RAI to mid Oxfordian and the top of RAM to upper Kimmeridgian.

40|$|In the {{northern}} region of South Island, New Zealand, a major tectonic transition {{occurs in the}} obliquely convergent Australia-Pacific plate boundary. The {{southern end of the}} Hikurangi subduction zone terminates against the Chatham Rise, a <b>submerged</b> continental <b>plateau</b> on the Pacific Plate, which is too buoyant to be subducted. Relative plate motion that is accommodated along the Hikurangi margin is transferred by a complex arrangement of faults, to a zone of transpressive, continental collision across the Southern Alps. A detailed study of offshore seismic-reflection profiles, sediment cores and bathymetry from the north Canterbury continental margin and north-western Chatham Rise reveals the complex interactions between late Cenozoic sedimentation and tectonics at the southern termination of the Hikurangi subduction zone. The north Canterbury shelf and the NW Chatham Rise slope are separated by major submarine canyons that link the shelf with the 3000 m-deep Hikurangi Trough. The sedimentary succession beneath the shelf and slope attains a maximum thickness of about 2 km and is inferred to be underlain by Torlesse terrane basement of Mesozoic age. The late Cenozoic stratigraphy of both regions has been established by correlating unconformity-bounded sedimentary units between seismic-reflection profiles, sampling the units in cores from exposures at the seabed, and dating the sediments by foraminifera and nannoflora biostratigraphy. Tectonic structures have been mapped from seismic profiles and the stratigraphy has been used to constrain the structural and sedimentary evolution of each area. The north Canterbury shelf and the NW Chatham slope exhibit contrasting tectonic and sedimentation styles, which reflect differences in proximity to sediment sources, bathymetry, physical oceanography, sedimentation response to global climate cycles and relative sea-level changes, and different stresses imposed on the basement rocks within the plate-boundary zone. Late Quaternary sedimentation patterns on the NW Chatham slope and in the southern Hikurangi Trough have been studied using 3. 5 kHz echo-character mapping. The slope is dominated by current-controlled sedimentary processes, whereas turbidite processes characterise the adjacent part of the southern Hikurangi Trough. On the slope north of Mernoo Saddle (a 580 m-deep depression between the South Island shelf and the Chatham Rise) a 160 x 30 km zone of current erosion occurs between 700 m and 2300 m water depths. Within this region are several northeast trending channels, 5 - 20 km wide and up to 105 km long, scoured obliquely down-slope. These scours are inferred to have been formed by a northward flowing current of Antarctic Intermediate Water passing through the Mernoo Saddle, then braiding as it cascaded down and across the mid-slope before merging again further east into a contour current on the unstable lower slope of {{the northern}} Chatham Rise. The lower slope between and below the scours comprises a complex of coalescing sediment drifts. The adjacent Hikurangi Trough is characterised by a canyon and levee-channel system that guide turbidites from the eastern South Island margin and Cook Strait. On the trough floor is a meandering axial channel up to 10 km wide, with a left-bank dominated levee off Cook Strait where the trough widens. Within the down-slope thickening, late Cenozoic succession on the NW Chatham slope there is a stratigraphic change in acoustic impedance that is inferred to mark a change from predominantly carbonate to terrigenous sedimentation in the Late Miocene (c. 9 - 10 Ma). This change might reflect an increase in uplift and erosion of the Southern Alps at this time. Analysis of 13 unconformity-bounded seismic units of Pliocene-Recent age indicates an episodic history of mid-bathyal (c. 700 - 2300 m) current erosion and deposition on the NW Chatham slope. Erosion began in the mid-Pliocene and was most widespread in the Late Pleistocene, when several regional scale erosion surfaces developed. The regional extent of the older surfaces differ from the pattern of oblique-to-slope, en echelon, scour channels and associated sediment drifts which are related only to the five youngest depositional units(< 0. 25 Ma). All erosional or non-depositional unconformities between the 13 Plio-Pleistocene seismic units resulted from major velocity changes in the northward, mid-bathyal flow over the Mernoo Saddle. Therefore, the sedimentary units and their intervening unconformities have a different origin to sea-level-controlled sequences in the Vail/Exxon stratigraphic model. The eight youngest seismic units are Late Pleistocene and have a cyclicity of about 57 - 75 ka, which is similar to high-order (40 and 100 ka) glacio-eustatic sea-level cycles. The older units, deposited between Early Pliocene and Late Pleistocene, have a longer frequency of about 750 ka. The similarity of the Late Pleistocene sequence cyclicity to that of high-order glacio-eustatic cycles, together with consideration of the physical oceanography, a recent phase of reduced erosion during the Holocene, and the inferred subsidence history of the region collectively suggest that the paleoceanographic fluctuations causing the sequences are related to high-amplitude Plio-Pleistocene glacial-interglacial climatic oscillations superimposed on the late Cenozoic subsidence of Mernoo Saddle. The north Canterbury inner-middle shelf is underlain by twelve unconformity bounded seismic units of Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene to Recent age. The units consist predominantly of terrigenous silty mud and thin layers of gravel, which are inferred to have been deposited in c. < 70 - 80 m water depth predominantly during transgressions and relative highstands of high amplitude, glacio-eustatic sea-level cycles. Erosional unconformities of middle Pleistocene to Recent age have been progressively tilted seaward as a result of contemporaneous coastal uplift and outer shelf subsidence. The north-western corner of the Chatham Rise has been extending by normal faulting since the Late Miocene (c. 8 - 6 Ma). The North Mernoo Fault Zone (NMFZ) is a 100 x 300 km extensional province that evolved contemporaneously with offshore sedimentation and with the plate-boundary zone in northern South Island. Growth faults are characteristic, but the distribution of faulting has varied temporally; The fault zone is seismically active and consists of a domino-style array of overlapping, southward dipping normal faults which are typically 2 - 5 km apart and trend roughly east-west at a high angle to the plate-boundary zone. Late Quaternary surface traces are widely distributed on the mid-upper continental slope but many surface scarps are poorly preserved due to extensive erosion of the seafloor. Despite the wide distribution of faulting, late Cenozoic extensional strain is < 2 %. The geometry of the NMFZ is partially inherited from older basement structures. Many of the late Cenozoic faults are reactivated Late Cretaceous and Eocene normal faults which developed during periods of widespread extension of the New Zealand region, in tectonic settings different from now. Two possible models for extension of the edge of continental Pacific Plate are considered: (1) lateral buckling of the upper continental crust across the southern termination of the Hikurangi subduction zone; and (2) flexure of the NW Chatham Rise as the region is bent downward into {{the southern end of the}} Hikurangi subduction zone. The extensional NMFZ is one of three offshore fault systems that almost merge together over the southern end of the Hikurangi subduction zone. The western end of the NMFZ crosses submarine canyons at the southern end of the Hikurangi Trough and extends to within 20 km of two opposite-verging, NE-trending fold and thrust fault systems on the north-eastern South Island continental margin. One fold and thrust system verges eastward and represents the southern part of the Hikurangi margin imbricated frontal wedge that is deforming the Marlborough continental slope above the southern part of the Hikurangi subduction zone. The other fold and thrust fault system verges north-westward and is deforming the north Canterbury shelf to the west of the NMFZ. In addition to tilting of the north Canterbury shelf, the inner edges of the Plio-Pleistocene units have been progressively deformed since the middle Pleistocene. Gentle, asymmetric folds up to 35 km long are inferred to be developing above the propagating tips of SE-dipping thrust faults. Some structural elements of the fold and thrust system may be reactivated Late Cretaceous extensional faults. The fold and thrust region extends 20 km offshore between central Pegasus Bay and Kaikoura. The north-eastern end of the zone extends to within 20 km of the extensional NMFZ, but these two fault systems are not linked kinematically, Two possible tectonic models for the north Canterbury coastal region are considered. The preferred model involves NW-SE oriented, upper-crustal shortening of much of the north Canterbury region, which is required to accommodate a component of the relative plate motion in northern South Island. A comparison with other obliquely convergent plate boundaries and with other tectonic settings where continental extensional faulting is occurring today, suggests that the style of tectonic interactions at the southern termination of the Hikurangi subduction zone is rare in the world...|$|R
