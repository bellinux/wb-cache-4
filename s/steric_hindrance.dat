5|$|Persistent carbenes {{can exist}} in the singlet or the triplet states with the singlet state carbenes being more stable. The {{relative}} stability of these compounds is only partly due to <b>steric</b> <b>hindrance</b> by bulky groups. Some singlet carbenes are thermodynamically stable {{in the absence of}} moisture and (in most cases) oxygen, and can be isolated and indefinitely stored. Others dimerise slowly over days. Triplet state carbenes have half-lives measured in seconds, and therefore can be observed but not stored.|$|E

On the other hand, mixtures of P 104 + P 103 and P 104 + P 84 prefer to remain ideal in their mixed state, while the mixtures of L 64 + P 104 and L 64 + P 84 show mainly unfavorable mixing.|$|R
5|$|The {{side-chain}} of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the substrate. The lone pair {{of electrons}} {{present on the}} oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive carbonyl carbon. The 20 naturally occurring biological amino acids do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult catalytic reactions. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the hydroxyl (OH) of serine and the thiol/thiolate ion (SH/S−) of cysteine. Alternatively, threonine proteases use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine, however due to <b>steric</b> <b>hindrance</b> of the side chain's extra methyl group such proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.|$|E

Here, we report the synthesis and electrodeposition of poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxypyrrole) (PEDOP) derivatives containing hydrocarbon chains (ethyl to tetradecyl). Surprisingly, the alkyl chain length has a very important infl uence on the surface morphology and as a consequence on the water-repellency properties. The amount of the nanoporosity and the water-repellency properties can be controlled with alkyl chain length.

50|$|Preferred DNA bend {{direction}} {{is determined by}} the stability of stacking each base on top of the next. If unstable base stacking steps are always found {{on one side of the}} DNA helix then the DNA will preferentially bend away from that direction. As bend angle increases then <b>steric</b> <b>hindrances</b> and ability to roll the residues relative to each other also play a role, especially in the minor groove. A and T residues will be preferentially be found in the minor grooves on the inside of bends.

25|$|One {{mechanism}} {{of resistance to}} vancomycin involves the alteration to the terminal amino acid residues of the NAM/NAG-peptide subunits, under normal conditions, D-alanyl-D-alanine, to which vancomycin binds.

This loss of just one point of interaction results in a 1000-fold decrease in affinity.

50|$|Aminoglycoside-3'-phosphotransferase (APH(3')), {{also known}} as {{aminoglycoside}} kinase, is an enzyme that primarily catalyzes the addition of phosphate from ATP to the 3'-hydroxyl group of a 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycoside, such as kanamycin. However, APH(3') has also been found to phosphorylate at the 5'-hydroxyl group in 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycosides, which lack a 3'-hydroxyl group, and to diphosphorylate hydroxyl groups in aminoglycosides that have both 3'- and 5'-hydroxyl groups. Primarily positively charged at biological conditions, aminoglycosides bind to the negatively charged backbone of nucleic acids to disrupt protein synthesis, effectively inhibiting bacterial cell growth. APH(3') mediated phosphorylation of aminoglycosides effectively disrupts their mechanism of action, introducing a phosphate group that reduces their binding affinity due to <b>steric</b> <b>hindrances</b> and unfavorable electrostatic interactions.
