When in May 1921 the Allied ultimatum on reparations ("London ultimatum") was presented to Germany and the <b>sanctions</b> <b>enforced</b> on the Rhine, the Fehrenbach cabinet, which had rejected the London terms, resigned, and Wirth was called upon to form a new cabinet as Reichskanzler. He succeeded in obtaining the cooperation of a number of Democrats (DDP) and Socialists (SPD), including the prominent industrialist and economist Walther Rathenau as Minister of Reconstructions. Wirth himself retained the portfolio of finance. The new government then accepted the Allies' reparation terms — 132 billion marks (£6,600,000,000) payable in yearly installments of £100,000,000 plus the proceeds of a 25% duty on German exports. By 31 August 1921, Germany had paid the first half-yearly installment of £50,000,000, and in the following October Rathenau succeeded in concluding a comprehensive agreement with France for paying reparations in kind for the reconstruction of the devastated regions.|$|E

40|$|The pre-reforms {{period of}} the Nigeria’s Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) was {{characterized}} by lack of standing system of tracking of companies’ compliance and general gross inefficiency {{in the delivery of}} services by the Commission. In 2001 CAC experienced reform and re-organization processes; meant to make it more responsive to discharging its regulatory role and achieving good corporate governance practices and efficiency in service delivery. The question is, has these processes strengthened the quality of services delivered by the Commission? The objectives of this paper are to highlight the components of the re-organization exercise of CAC and see how the reform has impacted on the Commissions’ performance. To achieve these, the paper employs the use of both empirical and secondary sources of data for analysis. The Service Quality Model was used as theoretical guide to the study. It was observed that the Commissions’ reform and re-organization has impacted in computerization of company registration process, improved human resource quality and even the introduction of new services. The paper, therefore, recommends that for good corporate governance practices to be achieved in Nigeria, the CAC should continue to strengthen its compliance and enforcement processes and procedures and also ensures that all the registered companies are continually monitored and <b>sanctions</b> <b>enforced</b> on defaulters. When compliance and enforcement mechanisms are reinforced, the Nigeria’s CAC would raise the confidence of investors and general public...|$|E
40|$|Most (if not all) {{studies on}} the {{perceptions}} of auditor independence were conducted using a quantitative approach. Sending questionnaires to collect data and testing hypothesis {{by the use of}} statistics have been very common. The lack of literature on auditor independence using a qualitative approach has inspired this present study, since the advantages of the qualitative approach cannot be reached by the quantitative. This is a perceptual study of auditor independence using an ethnographic, qualitative approach. Twenty-nine Indonesian auditors have been interviewed, in order to investigate their perceptions of factors that could affect auditor independence. Two theoretical models of independence, auditors-firms conflict of interest of Goldman and Barlev (1974) and Flint 2 ̆ 7 s (1988) material circumstances to independence, are used to explore the issues that were investigated. These issues are not 2 ̆ 2 truths 2 ̆ 2 to be proven, but used rather as interview guidelines. The interview data are summarised and pattern coded as proposed by Miles and Huberman (1984) and then analysed through description, analysis and interpretation suggested by Wolcott (1994). The use of pattern coding allows the researcher to classify answers and compare responses. The analysis introduced by Wolcott allows the researcher not only to analyse what auditors say but also to interpret beyond what they say. This study found that auditor independence would potentially depend on external and internal factors or circumstances. The external factors or circumstances are audit firms 2 ̆ 7 characteristics, clients 2 ̆ 7 characteristics, the nature of auditors and clients relationship and <b>sanctions</b> <b>enforced.</b> Audit firms 2 ̆ 7 characteristics included the size of the audit firm and non-audit services rendered to audit clients. The clients 2 ̆ 7 backgrounds, existence of a corporate audit committee and clients 2 ̆ 7 contribution to audit fees are regarded as clients 2 ̆ 7 circumstances that could influence auditor independence. Competition among auditors, clients 2 ̆ 7 directors 2 ̆ 7 roles and the length of audit engagement are consequences of their relationship that could affect auditor independence. <b>Sanctions</b> <b>enforced</b> by the professional body could also influence auditor independence. On the other hand, internal factors influencing auditor independence comes from auditors themselves. The state of professional ethics of auditors as a consequence of professionalism and the auditors 2 ̆ 7 religious values affect auditor independence. In perceiving these factors, the study found that auditors have consensus on the effect of sanctions on auditor independence. They believed that sanctions could enhance auditor independence. Whereas, for other factors the auditors have various perceptions ranging from impairment, no effect and enhancement of auditor independence. In addition, the study also identified the auditors 2 ̆ 7 understandings on independence, major threats and motivations among the above circumstances, the possibility to be total or partially independent and the auditors 2 ̆ 7 efforts to maintain their independence. The study concludes that auditor independence is a continuum, and is not black and white. Some new potential factors influencing independence have been found. The study also proposes a continuum model of independence and 2 ̆ 2 better 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 worse 2 ̆ 2 circumstances that potentially could affect auditor independence. Practical recommendations are suggested to the Indonesian Institute of Accountants, the Indonesian Government and relevant parties using audited financial statements. Some limitations of the study are acknowledged such as the lack of previous qualitative studies on auditor independence, the cross-sectional data collection and a limited number of interviewees. Some suggestions for future research include narrowing the research site into one big audit firm and using a longitudinal process for data collection...|$|E
40|$|Each {{state and}} {{territory}} within the United States {{is required by}} the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act [42 U. S. C. 5101 et seq. ] to maintain a mandatory suspected {{child abuse and neglect}} reporting law, requiring certain professionals who regularly see children to report any suspicions of child maltreatment to child protective services. It is well documented that mandatory reporters fail to report each case of suspected child maltreatment they witness. This study sought to determine whether differences in three specific variables within the mandatory report laws had an effect on the frequency with which medical personnel report suspected child abuse and neglect. The three variables analyzed were: definitional scope of emotional abuse; standard of knowledge required for a report; and severity of penalty imposed on those who knowingly fail to report cases of child abuse and neglect. Data was obtained from the Child Maltreatment 2006 annual report printed by the Health and Human Services Administration of Children, Youth and Families. Of the three variables assessed, only severity of penalty yielded a significant association with report rate. States with lower report rates {{were significantly more likely to}} have lenient penalties for failure to report compared with those who had report rates above the national average (O. R. = 5. 0, 95 % C. I. = 1. 165 - 21. 465). It is recommended that states consider increasing the severity of the <b>sanctions</b> <b>enforced</b> for failure to report suspected child abuse and neglect. Although standard of knowledge requirements were not significantly associated with report rates, the literature suggests that standardization of this portion of the mandatory report laws could improve report rates, particularly among physicians...|$|E

40|$|The {{historic}} Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) {{was implemented}} on January 16, 2016 between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the E 3 /EU+ 3. The JCPOA hopes {{to ensure that}} the nuclear program in Iran will exist solely for peaceful purposes. This agreement will end long-lasting and crippling <b>sanctions</b> <b>enforced</b> on Iran in exchange for inflexible reductions to the Iranian centrifuge enrichment program and assurances of the absence of efforts to develop, build, or acquire a nuclear weapon. Given Iran?s past actions of nuclear hedging and pushing the boundaries of agreements, policymakers would benefit from a reliable method to judge the effectiveness of this agreement and how it should influence future policy. One method that can help inform policy decisions is with estimates of a state?s Nuclear Weapon Latency. Nuclear Weapons Latency is defined as the time needed for a non-nuclear weapon state to develop a conventionally deliverable nuclear weapon. Iran?s Nuclear Weapon Latency was quantified with and without the JCPOA using the Nuclear Weapons Latency Computational Tool developed by D. Sweeney and W. Charlton at Texas A&M University. This MATLAB-based software focuses on the use of time-dependent proliferation pathway modeling using Petri Nets. The proliferation pathways used in this analysis include mining, milling, conversion, enrichment (gas centrifuge and atomic vapor laser isotope separation), reactor repair or construction, fuel fabrication, plutonium production, PUREX reprocessing, development of delivery systems, and weapon systems. A reference time was developed for each transition within the pathway using the reported capacity or production of a facility when known or using the Pakistani nuclear program as a historic model if the characteristics for the Iranian facility are not known. The Petri Nets simulation provides an estimate of the distribution of likely time durations of a nuclear program until the first deliverable weapon is produced. The simulation can be analyzed to test for sensitivities due to the pathways and input parameters. This testing could be valuable in the development of policy and the identification of the key technologies that could most impact Iran?s Nuclear Weapons Latency. The analysis performed here shows that the large reduction in the stockpile of nuclear material and enrichment capability caused a sizable increase in the Iranian Nuclear Weapons Latency...|$|E

40|$|Relatively little {{controversy}} surrounds {{three of}} the four core labor standards - forced labor, discrimination, and child labor. But the right to associate and organize freely and to bargain collectively is more controversial. And the use of trade <b>sanctions</b> to <b>enforce</b> labor standards is most divisive of all. In the context of trade negotiations, attention to labor issues can lower adjustment costs, slow a race to the bottom from the bottom, among developing countries themselves, and increase political support for trade agreements in developed countries. Elliott suggests using a parallel track to negotiate labor issues and link progress in those negotiations more closely to the trade negotiations. She concludes that nothing is to be gained by workers and labor activists keeping <b>sanctions</b> to <b>enforce</b> standards in trade agreements as the focus of their demands. Instead, they should ratchet up the pressure on governments to adopt concrete plans of action for raising labor standards and to finance implementation of those plans. ...|$|R

40|$|The annual {{harvest of}} Titi, Puifinus griseus, on islands {{adjacent}} to Rakiura (Stewart Island) by Rakiura Maori {{is one of}} the last large-scale customary uses of native wildlife in New Zealand. This study investigates whether Rakiura Maori harvesting practices constitute common property resource management and how these practices relate to the sustainability of Titi harvests. Semi-directive interviews were conducted with 20 experienced Titi harvesters and elders to record their matauranga Maori (Traditional Ecological Knowledge) and tikanga (lore) that govern this harvest. Access to the resource is shared and controlled by birthright. Informal and formal <b>sanctions</b> <b>enforce</b> the rules that promote sustainable use by protecting island habitat and adult birds, and minimising disturbance. These rules and other aspects of Titi harvesting practice conform to common property resource management theory. While adhering to the main resource rules, localised flexibility in management provides harvesters with the ability to adapt to changing environmental and social circumstances. Adaptive co-management of Titi harvesting has included turning lore into law to reinforce social institutions, integration of science and matauranga for sustainability assessments, and application of new ecosystem management tools. Environmentality is promoted by local self-government of Rakiura Maori Titi harvesting practice and island ecosystem management...|$|R
40|$|The {{tension between}} {{individual}} and collective interests {{and the provision of}} sanctioning mechanisms have been identified as important building blocks of a theory of norm emergence. Correspondingly, most investigations focus on how social norms emerge through explicit bargaining and social exchange to overcome this tension, and how <b>sanctions</b> <b>enforce</b> norm compliance. However, sanctioning presupposes the existence of the behavior at which it is directed, and the question of how behavior worth sanctioning can emerge tacitly if communication is not possible has hitherto received little attention. Here, we argue that game theory offers an ideal framework for theorizing about emergent behavioral regularities and show how latent norms can emerge from actors' recurring encounters in similar social dilemmas. We conduct two experiments in which small groups of subjects interact repeatedly in a volunteer's dilemma. We vary the heterogeneity of group members in terms of their costs of cooperation and the way they encounter each other in subsequent interactions. Our results show that subjects in homogeneous groups take turns at cooperating, whereas in heterogeneous groups mostly the subjects with the lowest costs cooperate. The emergence of solitary cooperation is moderated by the way subjects encounter each other again and their other-regarding preferences...|$|R
