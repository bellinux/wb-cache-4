5|$|The {{traditional}} focuses {{of sociology}} include social stratification, social class, social mobility, religion, secularization, law, sexuality and deviance. As all spheres {{of human activity}} {{are affected by the}} interplay between social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects, such as health, medical, economy, military and penal institutions, the Internet, education, social capital and the role of <b>social</b> <b>activity</b> in the development of scientific knowledge.|$|E

A big attraction for them was the opportunity that the game offered for gambling and this escalated {{in the years following}} the Restoration when cricket in London and the south-eastern counties of England evolved into a popular <b>social</b> <b>activity.</b> Its patrons staged lucrative eleven-a-side matches featuring the earliest professional players. Meanwhile, English colonists had introduced cricket to North America and the West Indies, and the sailors and traders of the East India Company had taken it to the Indian subcontinent.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{decline from}} {{the turn of}} the 20th century, coupled with the {{building}} of Gateshead's first council estate, saw Carr Hill transformed from an industrial settlement into a residential suburb of the Gateshead Council ward of Deckham. Governed locally and nationally by the Labour Party, the suburb is economically disadvantaged compared to other areas of the borough and nationally, with high levels of unemployment and low levels of income. It is served by Carr Hill Primary School. There are two small parks that contribute to the <b>social</b> <b>activity</b> of the area, as does the Elgin Centre at Elgin Road. Two historic venues, both now closed, face uncertain futures, as does the parish church.|$|E
5|$|Most bovids are diurnal. <b>Social</b> <b>activity</b> {{and feeding}} usually peak during dawn and dusk. Bovids {{typically}} rest before dawn, during midday, and after dark. They have various methods of social organisation and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Bovids use {{different forms of}} vocal, olfactory, and tangible communication. Most species alternately feed and ruminate throughout the day. While small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed on high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands. Most bovids are polygynous. Mature bovids mate {{at least once a}} year and smaller species may even mate twice. In some species, neonate bovids remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers; in other species, neonates are followers, accompanying their dams, rather than tending to remain hidden.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to analyse}} in depth the {{determinants}} of disclosure of corporate <b>social</b> <b>activities.</b> In particular, it is focused on a barely considered factor: ownership structure. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of Spanish listed companies in 2008 we employed a OLS model to analyse how {{the identity of the}} largest shareholder as well as other firm characteristics may influence the disclosure of <b>social</b> <b>activities.</b> Findings and Originality: Contrary to our expectations, the findings suggest that the identity of the main shareholder does not affect the disclosure of <b>social</b> <b>activities.</b> On the contrary, firm size, leverage and general level of disclosure seem to explain the information provided by the firms related to their <b>social</b> <b>activities.</b> Research Limitations/implications: Our results should be considered with caution because we have used a specific measure of disclosure of <b>social</b> <b>activities</b> and our study is carried out in a specific country and period of time. Originality/value: A reduced number of studies have analysed the influence of firm ownership structure on the disclosure of <b>social</b> <b>activities,</b> and the existing studies have mainly considered the ownership concentration but not the identity of the largest shareholder. </p...|$|R
5|$|For {{those who}} are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes {{difficulties}} and insecurities with respect to one's ability to meet new partners and start relationships. In some settings, beauty standards cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners {{of people with disabilities}} like SCI. Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled accessibility of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to <b>social</b> <b>activity</b> and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.|$|E
5|$|Savage {{returned}} to San Francisco {{with his wife}} to stay for ten years, raising a daughter and {{taking part in a}} family business. He served at the rank of colonel in the California National Guard, and took part in the <b>social</b> <b>activity</b> of the city. During a period of anti-Chinese race riots, Savage stood up for law and order, and thereby gained the respect of San Francisco's leaders, property holders and middle class residents. Savage traveled to many exotic lands but in 1890 he was struck with jungle fever in Honduras. While recuperating in New York state he wrote his first book: My Official Wife. This very successful action-and-adventure story was followed by more, at the rate of about three per year, written for the general public rather than for literary critics; the latter were charmed by the first book but scathing of many later ones. Savage lived primarily in New York City, and was involved in lawsuits, especially against his New York publisher regarding unpaid royalties.|$|E

40|$|This interpretive {{qualitative}} study explores the lived experiences of seven hijabi youth {{and how they}} experience <b>social</b> <b>activities</b> offered in their secondary schools in Ottawa, Ontario. The main research questions are: (1) How do hijabi women in Ottawa secondary schools experience the <b>social</b> <b>activities</b> offered by their schools, and (2) In what ways are hijabi girls being included or excluded from <b>social</b> <b>activities</b> because of their religious obligations? A phenomenological tradition of inquiry {{has been used in}} order to understand the essence of the experience as perceived by each participant. Analysis has been conducted using Moustakas' (1994) modifications to the Stevick-Colaizzi-Keen Method of Phenomenological Data. The researcher has also shared her own story of interaction with <b>social</b> <b>activities</b> in high school. The findings and implications of this study have been categorized into themes in order to illustrate the essence of how hijabi youth experience <b>social</b> <b>activities</b> in Ottawa secondary schools. The themes identified are: (a) Us Versus Them; (b) Fighting Stereotypes; (c) Culture Differences; and (d) A Desire to Participate. The first emergent theme, Us Versus Them, explains the alienation hijabi students feel when partaking in <b>social</b> <b>activities</b> offered at their schools. The second emergent theme, Fighting Stereotypes, details the everyday questions, assumptions and judgements hijabi students face from peers both Muslim and non-Muslims that ultimately discourage them from partaking in activities. The third emergent theme, Culture Differences, explains how current <b>social</b> <b>activities</b> in schools compromise the religious values of hijabi girls. The fourth and final emergent theme, A Desire to Participate illustrates participants' willingness and in some instances, eagerness to participate in school <b>social</b> <b>activities.</b> The author aims to raise awareness of how hijabi girls experience social aspects of high school and with that, a message for academic authorities to examine how their students are being included or excluded with means towards creating in inclusive environment. The conclusion of this thesis raises implications for further study such as the role that self-esteem plays in the participation of hijabi girls in school <b>social</b> <b>activities...</b>|$|R
