This study aims at designing a novel dosage form of sustained release taste-masked QT orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) based on solid lipid micro-pellets (SLMPs). QT SLMPs were prepared using the hot melt extrusion technique and utilizing three lipid carriers: Compritol, Precirol and white beeswax either alone or in mixtures. They showed sustained QT release and a taste masking effect. The selected QT SLMP was further blended with an aqueous solution containing polyvinylpyrollidone (2. 5 %), croscarmellose sodium (2 %) and mannitol (50 %); it was then lyophilized into ODT in a mass ratio of 1 : 2, respectively. ODTs containing QT SLMPs showed: average wetting time (40. 92 s), average oral disintegration time (21. 49 s), average hardness (16. 85 N) and also imparted suitable viscosity to <b>suspend</b> <b>pellets</b> during the lyophilization process.

40|$|The {{potential}} of two zygomycetes fungi, Mucor indicus and Rhizopus oryzae, in assimilating citrus waste free sugars (CWFS) and producing fungal chitosan, oil, and protein {{as well as}} ethanol was investigated. Extraction of free sugars from citrus waste can reduce its environmental impact by decreasing the possibility of wild microorganisms growth and formation of bad odors, a typical problem facing the citrus industries. A total sugar concentration of 25. 1 g/L was obtained by water extraction of citrus waste at room temperature, used for fungal cultivation in shake flasks and airlift bioreactor with no additional nutrients. In shake flasks cultivations, the fungi were only able to assimilate glucose, while fructose remained almost intact. In contrast, the cultivation of M. indicus and R. oryzae in the four-liter airlift bioreactor resulted in the consumption of almost all sugars and production of 250 and 280 g fungal biomass per kg of consumed sugar, respectively. These biomasses correspondingly contained 40 % and 51 % protein and 9. 8 % and 4. 4 % oil. Furthermore, the fungal cell walls, obtained after removing the alkali soluble fraction of the fungi, contained 0. 61 and 0. 69 g chitin and chitosan per g of cell wall for M. indicus and R. oryzae, respectively. Moreover, the maximum ethanol yield of 36 % and 18 % was obtained from M. indicus and R. oryzae, respectively. Furthermore, that M. indicus grew as clump mycelia in the airlift bioreactor, while R. oryzae formed spherical <b>suspended</b> <b>pellets,</b> is a promising feature towards industrialization of the process.

The CASY system revealed a smaller fraction of suspended RT 4 cells with impaired membrane integrity than the flow cytometric assay. No differences were found for pelleted RT 4 cells and suspended J 82 cells. The discrepancies of the two viability assays indicated a different response of the cell membrane to shock waves which was dependent on the exposure system and the cell type. Growth curves indicated delayed cell death for suspended RT 4 cells and exclusively immediate cell death for pelleted RT 4 cells and suspended J 82 cells. PI positive suspended RT 4 cells were morphologically intact while pelleted RT 4 cells and suspended J 82 cells were mainly disrupted.

40|$|Conjugative pili are {{extracellular}} filaments elaborated by Gram-negative bacteria expressing {{certain type}} IV secretion systems. They are required {{at the earliest}} stages of conjugal DNA transfer to establish specific and secure cell–cell contacts. Conjugative pili also serve as adsorption organelles for both RNA andDNA bacteriophages. Beyond these facts, the structure, formation and function of these filaments are poorly understood. This paper describes a rapid, quantitative assay for F-pili encoded by the F plasmid type IV secretion system. The assay {{is based on the}} specific lateral adsorption of icosahedral RNA bacteriophage R 17 by F-pili. Bacteriophage particles conjugated with a fluorescent dye, Alexa 488, and bound to F-pili defined filaments visible by immunofluorescence microscopy. F-pili attached to F+ cells and free F-pili were both visible by this method. For quantification, cell-bound bacteriophage were separated from free bacteriophage particles by sedimentation and released by <b>suspending</b> cell <b>pellets</b> in 0 ? 1 % SDS. Fluorescence in cell-free supernatant fractions was measured by fluorometry. The authors present a characterization of this assay and its application to F-pilus formation by cells carrying mutations in the gene for the F-pilus subunit F-pilin. Each mutation introduced a cysteine, which F-pilin normally lacks, at a different position in its primary structure. Cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain I abolished filament formation as measured by fluorescent R 17 binding. This was confirmed by measurements of DNA donor activity and filamentous DNA bacteriophage infection. With one exception (G 53 C), cysteines elsewhere in the F-pilin primary structure did not abolish filament formation, although some mutations differentially affected F-pilus functions...|$|R

Vaccination with M. bovis Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) is being considered for management of bovine tuberculosis in deer. Presently, no method exists to non-invasively monitor the presence of bovine tuberculosis in deer. In this study, volatile organic compound profiles of BCG-vaccinated and non-vaccinated deer, before and after experimental challenge with M. bovis strain 95 - 1315, were generated using solid phase microextraction fiber head-space sampling over <b>suspended</b> fecal <b>pellets</b> with analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Chromatograms were processed using XCMS Online to characterize ion variation among treatment groups. The principal component scores resulting from significant (α = 0. 05) ion responses were used to build linear discriminant analysis models. The sensitivity and specificity of these models were used to evaluate the feasibility of using this analytical approach to distinguish within group comparisons between pre- and post-M. bovis challenge: non-vaccinated male or female deer, BCG-vaccinated male deer, and the mixed gender non-vaccinated deer data. Seventeen compounds were identified in this analysis. The peak areas for these compounds were used to build a linear discriminant classification model based on principal component analysis scores to evaluate the feasibility of discriminating between fecal samples from M. bovis challenged deer, irrespective of vaccination status.

40|$|In {{this report}} the authors {{describe}} the progress made in FY 09 {{in evaluating the}} feasibility of a new concept for using the DT fusion reaction to produce intense pulses of 14 MeV neutrons. In this new scheme the heating of the DT is accomplished using fission fragments rather than ion beams as in conventional magnet confinement fusion schemes or lasers in inertial confinement schemes. As a source of fission fragments they propose using a dust reactor concept introduced some time ago by one of us (RC). An attractive feature {{of this approach is}} that there is no need for a large auxiliary power source to heat the DT plasma to the point where self-sustaining fusion become possible. Their scheme does require pulsed magnetic fields, but generating these fields requires only a modest power source. The dust reactor that they propose using for their neutron source would use micron-sized UC <b>pellets</b> <b>suspended</b> in a vacuum as the reactor fuel. Surrounding the fuel with a moderator such as heavy water (D{sub 2 }O) would allow the reactor to operate as a thermal reactor and require only modest amounts of HEU. The scheme for using fission fragments to generate intense pulses of 14 MeV neutrons is based on the fission fragment rocket idea. In the fission fragment rocket scheme it was contemplated that the fission fragments produced in a low density reactor core could be guided out of the reactor by large magnetic fields used to form a 'rocket exhaust'. Their adaptation of this idea for the purposes of making a neutron source involves using the fission fragments escaping from one side of a tandem magnet mirror to heat DT gas confined in the adjacent magnetic trap...|$|R

The use of highly infected mosquitoes (> 20 000 sporozoites per mosquito) is advisable in order to minimize bacterial and fungal contamination. Prior training on uninfected mosquitoes is highly recommended. - Efficient removal of mosquito debris during the washing steps prior to adding Matrigel. This can be achieved most optimally by using a Percoll (10) or an Accudenz (11) cushion to purify the sporozoites. - Keep Matrigel on ice to avoid untimely polymerization. - Infected co-cultured cells: avoid shaking that might perturb the cells during handling, and changes to the temperature the cultures during medium addition. - Good fixation relies on a total removal of Matrigel. ### Timing - Preparation of co-cultured cells requires around 2 hours. - The full procedure, including counting, for sporozoite isolation from 100 mosquitoes generally necessitates 2 hours when 2 trained technicians carry out the dissection. - Infection of the co-cultures requires one hour followed by an additional 3 - 4 hours for the co-incubation of cells and sporozoites. - Matrigel cover requires 1. 5 h including the incubation step (for one 48 wells culture plate) ### Troubleshooting - Hepatocyte density: hepatocytes need to be highly confluent in order to thrive, particularly for long-term cultures (hepatocyte differentiation relies in large part on establishing good intercellular junctions). It is advisable to determine the optimal cell density for seeding on the plates selected for the cultivation. - Should the viability of the hepatocytes be lower than 90 %, it might be more difficult to reach adequate hepatocyte density. In order to eliminate dead cells (thus increasing the proportion viable) one can add a Percoll purification step prior to plating: re-suspend the hepatocyte suspension in 10 ml column of 40 % iso-osmotic Percoll, and then centrifuge at 900 x g for 3 min at RT without brake; remove the supernatant and the interphase containing dead cells; <b>suspend</b> the <b>pellet</b> of viable hepatocytes in 20 ml culture medium and centrifuge again at 200 x g for 1 min at RT; discard the supernatant and suspend the cells in a known volume of culture medium; enumerate the cells and determine the proportion viable (Trypan blue dye exclusion) using a haemocytometer; adjust density to 0. 8 million of viable cells per mL. - Contamination of the cultures is often due to inadequate care (sloppy sterile technique) during mosquito dissection or mosquito contamination during breeding. - The wounding due to the cell traversal activity of sporozoites can lead to a degradation of the cell layer in the co-cultures. The effect should be minor when 100, 000 sporozoites or less are used to infect each well. ### Anticipated Results - Following the 3 -day atovaquone treatment (usually Day 8 post-infection), the number of maturing hepatic schizonts should diminish by > 80 %, and the number of hypnozoites should be similar to that in the untreated wells - One week after atovaquone treatment (usually Day 15 post-infection), a proportion of the hypnozoites should have activated to resume development, and consequently the number of hepatic schizonts observed should mirror the decrease in the number of hypnozoites - In the absence of a Matrigel layer, merosomes should be detectable in the culture medium from D 8 post-infection in co-cultures not treated with atovaquone, or from Day 16 post-infection onward in atovaquone-treated co-culture (8 days after the end of treatment) ### References 1.

The acridine orange signals were detected at 506 - 590 nm. Z-series profiles {{of an average}} of 20 optical sections were collected at intervals of 1 μm with a line average of 2 to reduce noise. ### Procedure - **Culture of cells-TIMING 30 min** 1. Harvest cells growing in monolayer in T- 75 ml cell culture flasks. Add 5. 0 ml of trypsin-EDTA to each plate and incubate {{at room temperature for}} 4 min. Add 5. 0 ml of RPMI 1640 with 10 % FBS and 25 mM HEPES cell culture medium and transfer cell suspension into a 15 ml conical tube. - <b>Pellet</b> <b>suspended</b> cells in 15 ml conical tubes using a centrifuge for 5 min at 500 g. Re-suspend each cell pellet in 2 - 3 ml of media and perform cell counts. - Place a coverslip inside culture plates (6 well-plate) with sterilized tweezers. - CRITICAL STEP. It is very important that all coverslips used for growing cells must be carefully handled to avoid contamination. Caution should also be taken when place the growing side (usually only one side is treated for cell attachment) of the coverslip correctly. - Complete media is then added to culture plates (2 ml) without dropping media over the coverslips to ensure that cells keep attached to the surface. - Cells are seeded at the appropriate final density (50, 000 cells/ml but may vary depending on cell type/size). After adding cells, plates are slowly shaken to homogenize cell distribution. **? TROUBLESHOOTING** - Cells were left growing for 48 hours inside cell incubator. - **Staining with fluorescence molecule- TIMING 20 minutes** - Add 2 ml of fresh RPMI medium with 0. 2 % FBS in new 6 well plates. Three of the wells are used for washing (PBS-glucose) while the other can be used employed for staining. - Add 20 µl of AO solution to RPMI medium of three plates and shake to homogenize. - Using sterilized tweezers place each one of the coverslips containing cells in one of the wells with washing solution for 1 minute and then take coverslips into wells for staining during 10 minutes at RT. - After this time pipet 100 µl of RPMI medium with 0. 2 % FBS on a clean slide and then place coverslips with cells over medium upside-down. Then mounting medium is used as adhesive, using it only in the external limits of coverslip to avoid auto-fluorescence. - Immediately after mounting place slide with one drop of immersion oil under the confocal microscopy. **? TROUBLESHOOTING** - POINT WITHOUT PAUSE- It is strongly required to start collecting images from confocal microscope immediately after mounting. Therefore we do recommend mounting slides in the same room where confocal analysis is done. - **Capturing images with confocal microscopy** - Run the software with the setting up indicated above (see equipment setup). - Search area of interest to include as many individual cells as possible. - Indicate the coordinates to make the slices for analyzing. - Establish 1 µm depth slices and store images for further processing - To ensure reproducibility, repeat the process described in steps 12 - 14 until a number over 100 cells is reached. - **Image data preparation** - Run the ‘Imaris’ program for processing images. - In the menu ‘File’, select ‘Open’ and click in the first section image, so the software will open all section images taken. - In the new window that pops-up, select ‘volume’, ‘surface’ and then click on the `blend’ button. In the keyboard press ‘Ctrl+D’ and a new window pops-up. In this new window select “auto blend” and then close this window. - Now, select ‘surface’ and in the flag of ‘create’ press two times blue bottom of play. - In this step it is possible to modify the absolute intensity but we rather recommend to click the ‘automatic mode’ so we minimize manipulation of images. - Click again on the ‘play’ button and a new window will pops-up filled with several lines corresponding to the different cell volumes. You must move the threshold line up in order to eliminate those objects that correspond to incomplete cells with too low volumes or “cut-off” cells on both sides of image selected. Then click again on the blue button to finish these steps. - Select tab labeled as ‘pencil’ and click on ‘select’ for selecting all those incomplete cells that were impossible to eliminate in the previous step. For eliminating those cells just select them and then ‘delete’. **? TROUBLESHOOTING** - When working with specific cell types, many of them grow either in clusters or they form groups in which many of the cells remain bound one to each other. When this happens, it is necessary to cut between two or more cells. However it is quite easy to identify the binding area because usually it appears as a “valley” just between adjacent cells thus indicating the joining point. Consequently user has to choose these points and make the appropriate cuttings for obtaining accurate measurements. **? TROUBLESHOOTING** - Once user has completed this part of the software image processing of all cells, all data have been acquired by computer. To obtain data, select tab labeled as ‘statistic’ and then ‘detailed’ and choose the desired parameter such as ‘volume’, ‘surface’ or ‘sphericity’. A table containing data will then appear. Just click on any of the data displayed and then the corresponding cell image will appear, so user can easily correlate any of the data with the cellular source. - Data can be easily exported to an excel datasheet by selecting in the same tab the ‘save’ command. A new window will then appear with the corresponding data. - *OPTIONAL STEP*; It is recommended to save a copy of image using the ‘snapshot’ command. This will save pictures as a ‘tiff’ file which can be further used under any other program for treating images (i. e. Photoshop, Paint Shop, etc…). This would allow users to compare and correlate data with cells using other programs with a more intuitive interface. ### Timing - Culture of cells-TIMING 30 min- 48 h (Steps 1 - 6) - Staining with fluorescence molecule-TIMING 20 min (Steps 7 - 11) - Capturing images with confocal microscopy -TIMING 15 min (Steps 12 - 16). Without repetition - Image data preparation -TIMING 20 min (Steps 17 - 27. Without repetition. ### Troubleshooting - PROBLEM: Step 5 and 24 -Density of cultured cells. Too many/few cells appear at final magnification. - SOLUTION: The density of cells is crucial at this point since the main objective is the real morphology of cells and therefore the treatment of images coming from real cells. To do so it is highly recommended to seed a few cells initially so image handling is easier when cell density is much below confluence. If cell density is near 90 - 100 % it becomes difficult to isolate cells without cutting joints between cells. Otherwise it would be time consuming and not easy to obtain clean images and reproducibility is also lower. - PROBLEM: Step 11 -Speed too low while manipulating coverslips and confocal microscopy. - SOLUTION: At this step when confocal microscopy is ready if operator is quick enough it is then feasible to scan more than five fields in the same coverslip in a minimum time. Otherwise, if all these steps are performed too slowly, only 2 - 3 fields can be analyzed and more coverslip are required to scan to obtain optimal results. The stopping point is indicated by the presence of bubbles or any other visual artifact, as this is an indicator that cells are not kept under normal conditions. - PROBLEM: Step 14 and 23 -Height of cells out of range. - SOLUTION: When choosing low and high limits in z-axis for cell screening (step 14), some of the cells are placed too up or down and consequently the whole cell is not contained in the gap. In these cases cells should not be considered for quantifying and operator must eliminate them manually at step 23. - PROBLEM: Step 17 to 27 -Treatment of images 1. - SOLUTION: Although it might be deduced that these steps depend highly on operator, following a few indications ensures that the whole process becomes more reproducible. By comparing two independent observers here we demonstrate that differences obtained in cells parameters after the whole process is completed are below 1 %. To this aim {{it is very important that}} all steps are set in automatic mode. If operator changes intensity manually in the software, care should be taken so intensity must be changed accordingly for all the measurements, otherwise process is subjective. On the contrary, setting mode to ‘automatic’, measurements are performed equally in all the cells. All these steps are further explained in a tutorial video shown as supplementary material video 1. ### Anticipated Results For several researchers it may be very important to know exactly the intracellular concentrations of exogenous and endogenous compounds, proteins, DNA, RNA or any others molecules of interest. Currently there are several analytical applications for estimating the presence and the amount of virtually any molecule inside cells (11). On the contrary, scientists do not have simple tools to estimate cell volume. To fill this gap, the primordial objective in this work was to create an easy, reproducible and accurate method to calculate volume of cells. Thus, in combination with HPLC or any other analytical method, the protocol shown here will allow estimation of intracellular concentration of molecules. Results with data of volumes from different cell types using the protocol reported here are shown in table 1. As it can be seen in table 1, it is remarkable the differences in cell volumes measured in different cell types. In some cases, differences of volume can be observed at microscopy level because cell diameter is the major source of variation. However, in other cell types diameter do not vary significantly and differences observed are rather due to cell height so our protocol would be especially useful for the latter. Protocol is easy to perform with most cells. Other cell types like murine macrophages RAW 264. 7 cells offer particular difficulties. RAW 264. 7 macrophages are easily activated by LPS or other factors including high cell density. When cells are activated they change dramatically in morphology which can be easily followed up under microscope. This particular feature was also identified using our method as it can be seen in table 2. In this case we observed that when RAW 264. 7 cells were cultured at a density near 70 % a high error in cell volume was noticed. This was due to both morphology and volume changes. When those “activated” cells are identified and processed apart (table 2, see RAWc), the volume of the rest cells (RAW^b) are virtually the same that in other tests (see table 1 for comparing). Furthermore with this data we can assure that morphology changes can be identified and even quantified. Furthermore, although we have mainly emphasized the use of this method for cell volume determination, it is possible to quantify other geometric parameters such as surface area or sphericity. In the latter case, sphericity, it can be used for quantifying morphological changes in which exogenous stimuli trigger changes in morphology or for quantifying differences of morphology between cell types. Figure 3 shows an example of how the protocol may illustrate and quantify the differences in cell morphology by comparing the 3 D image reconstruction. For this purpose, we have provided videos 2, 3, 4 and 5 as supplementary material, where differences in cell morphology between cell t...|$|R
