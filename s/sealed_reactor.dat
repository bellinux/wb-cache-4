25|$|Digestion {{systems can}} be {{configured}} with different levels of complexity. In a single-stage digestion system (one-stage), all of the biological reactions occur within a single, <b>sealed</b> <b>reactor</b> or holding tank. Using a single stage reduces construction costs, but results in less control of the reactions occurring within the system. Acidogenic bacteria, through the production of acids, reduce the pH of the tank. Methanogenic bacteria, as outlined earlier, operate in a strictly defined pH range. Therefore, the biological reactions of the different species in a single-stage reactor can be in direct competition with each other. Another one-stage reaction system is an anaerobic lagoon. These lagoons are pond-like, earthen basins used for the treatment and long-term storage of manures. Here the anaerobic reactions are contained within the natural anaerobic sludge contained in the pool.|$|E

30|$|The role {{of radical}} chain {{reactions}} {{is clear from}} the reactivities of the Ph and Non-Ph Cγ-deoxy β-ether dimers, which vary substantially depending on the reactor type, (i.e., open-top and <b>sealed</b> <b>reactors</b> [50]. Although the dimers are recovered without undergoing pyrolysis reactions in open-top reactors, which allows volatile products to exit the heating zone, the reactivities of these compounds are dramatically increased in <b>sealed</b> <b>reactors.</b> Furthermore, the addition of tetralin effectively suppresses the reactivities in <b>sealed</b> <b>reactors.</b> From analysis of the products, two radical chain pathways (Fig.  7) have been suggested, which start from the Cα and phenoxy radicals formed via hydrogen abstraction of Cα–H and phenolic OH, respectively [51]. These reactions cleave β-ether bonds to form Cα=O and Cα[*]=[*]Cβ type monomers via the β-scission type reaction of the Cα-radical and homolytic cleavage of the β-ether bond in the quinone methide intermediate, respectively. These pathways have been confirmed by the studies of kinetic deuterium isotope effects on product formation from regiospecifically deuterated dimers [53].|$|R

The FT-IR spectra of the liquefied wood residues showed a peak at 1735 cm- 1, which was attributed to the ester carbonyl group in xylan, disappeared in the spectrum of the residue from liquefied wood under a sealed reaction system, indicating different liquefaction mechanisms of the liquefaction reactions conducted in the atmospheric glass <b>reactor</b> versus <b>sealed</b> metal <b>reactor.</b> The crystallinity index of the liquefied wood residues was {{higher than that of}} the original wood particles. Two different liquefied wood/phenol/formaldehyde (LWPF) resins were synthesized from liquefied wood reacted in an atmospheric glass reactor (LWPF-A) and a <b>sealed</b> metal <b>reactor</b> (LWPF-B). The onset cure temperature of LWPF-A resin was higher than LWPF-B while the peak temperatures of these two resins were close. The activation energies of two LWPF resins were similar {{to each other and to}} a lignin-phenol-formaldehyde resin. However, they both were higher than a typical phenolformaldehyde resin.

The {{average molecular weight}} of the LWPF resin made from the liquefied wood reacted in an at-mospheric three neck flask increased with increasing P/W ratio. However, it decreased with increasing phenol/wood ratio when using a <b>sealed</b> Parr <b>reactor.</b> On average, the LWPF resin made from the liquefied wood reacted in the Parr reactor had lower molecular weight than those from the atmospheric three neck flask. The infrared spectra of the LWPF resins were {{similar to that of}} the conven-tional novolac resin but showed a major difference at the 1800 – 1600 cm− 1 region. These results indicate that lique-fied wood could partially substitute phenol in the novolac resin synthesis. The composites with the liquefied wood resin from the <b>sealed</b> Parr <b>reactor</b> yielded higher thickness swelling than those with the liquefied wood resin from the three neck flask likely due to the hydrophilic wood compo-nents incorporated in it and the lower cross-link density than the liquefied wood resin from the three neck flask during the resin cure process...|$|R

First, poly[(propargy] methacrylate) -r-(glycidyl methacrylate) -r-(methyl methacrylate) ] random copolymers with monomer ratios of respectively 27 / 27 / 46, 41 / 31 / 28, and 45 / 55 / 0 were synthesized by RAFT polymerization. Then, dense alkyne-functionalized pseudobrushes were grafted in melt by thermal ring-opening of the glycidyl groups by the silanols from the silicon substrate. Finally, the grafting of tailor-made α-methoxy-ω-azido-poly(ethylene glycol) s (Mw ∼ 5000, 20000, and 50000 g/mol) by Cu(I) -catalyzed Huisgen 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition {{was performed in}} <b>sealed</b> <b>reactors</b> at 60 °C for 72 h using a polymer weight fraction of 10 % in tetrahydrofuran and Cu(PPh 3) 3 Br/DIPEA as the catalytic system.

This "grafting-to" approach represents a fast and versatile method to provide thick and homogeneous polymer brushes with a high surface coverage. A major benefit of this strategy is the tunable and versatile tethering of alkyne functionalities to silicon substrates using a straightforward spin-coating procedure...|$|R

5000|$|The technique, {{which was}} popularized by Schäfer, entails the {{reversible}} conversion of nonvolatile elements and chemical compounds into volatile derivatives. [...] The volatile derivative migrates throughout a <b>sealed</b> <b>reactor,</b> typically a sealed and evacuated glass tube heated in a tube furnace. Because the tube {{is under a}} temperature gradient, the volatile derivative reverts to the parent solid and the transport agent is released at the end opposite to which it originated (see next section).

So-called two-zone tube furnaces are employed for this purpose.

The mechanism involves electron transfer/proton transfer from the amine to the dye as the primary photochemical reaction. Oxygen quenches the triplet state of the dye, leading to retardation of the reaction. We used time-resolved steady-state fluorescence monitoring to observe the MB concentration in situ in both a constant oxygen environment and a <b>sealed</b> <b>reactor</b> as the dye is consumed via photoreaction. In the <b>sealed</b> <b>reactor,</b> we observed a retardation period (attributed to the presence of oxygen) followed by rapid exponential decay of the MB fluorescence after the oxygen was depleted.

The iodonium salt is an electron acceptor, acting to reoxidize the neutral dye radical back to its original state and allowing it to reenter the primary photochemical process.

30|$|Our method {{does not}} require a <b>sealed</b> <b>reactor,</b> which {{presents}} a path for continuous line production of CNWs. An atmospheric-pressure process to replace the vacuum process should also reduce the product cost. A recent study on the high cost of modern vacuum deposition methods highlighted the need for atmospheric synthesis [34]. The as-grown CNWs were decorated with oxygen-containing functional groups. By thermal annealing in H 2, most oxygen functional groups can be effectively eliminated. In addition, most of the product CNWs are non-aggregated with large surface area, which makes the product readily useful for various applications such as sensing and catalysis. This is in contrast to stacked CNWs that require additional dispersion, such as through ultrasonication, to obtain individual CNWs. To illustrate the advantage of our growth method, CNWs deliberately grown between metal electrodes were used for detection of low-concentration gases including NO 2 and NH 3, thereby demonstrating a one-step gas sensor fabrication process.|$|E
