In doing so, Arabs (Algerians, Moroccans, and Tunisians) in France began to develop a stronger identity unified by the problems that have been imposed on them economically and politically. The banlieue became a unifying point for the marginalised immigrants of France even if there are various identities that constitute these individual groups.

And that we're about to celebrate the year 2000, which is this hands less than one inch apart. So here's this number line; here's what we know and celebrate. This book is a conversation with a man and an ape. And the ape really has it all together. He kinda knows the differences between him and the man, and points out how slight they are, and it creates an easy analogy for what man has done, thinking that they were the end-all. That man is the end-all thing on this earth. That the earth was around even so much longer before the 3 million years. Fifty million years of sharks and all these living things.
