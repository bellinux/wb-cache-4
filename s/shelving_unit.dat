25|$|In June 2009 {{the police}} at Scotland Yard and the Crown Prosecution Service issued a {{statement}} regarding MPs' expenses, which stated {{that they had not}} found evidence of criminal activity and that it was 'highly unlikely' that MPs would face charges. The police said that the incidents of flipping second homes to avoid paying capital gains tax was not a matter for police investigation. Following an investigation by Sir Thomas Legg, Blears was told to repay £225 in expenses in relation to a glass <b>shelving</b> <b>unit</b> for her London flat.|$|E

50|$|A {{day to day}} {{example of}} {{pretension}} is a <b>shelving</b> <b>unit</b> supported by wires running from floor to ceiling. The wires hold the shelves in place because they are tensioned - if the wires were slack the system would not work.|$|E
40|$|Women in {{long white}} uniforms and caps {{are working in}} the room. Most are seated on stools working at counters. Small <b>shelving</b> <b>units</b> with screen doors are on the counters. There are several tall <b>shelving</b> <b>units</b> in the room. One woman is {{standing}} by a shelf reaching for a bottle. The windows in the back are open...|$|R
50|$|Smaller objects (elements of ship {{equipment}} and cargo) {{are placed in}} the studio warehouse <b>shelving</b> <b>units,</b> where visitors can see them from up close.|$|R
50|$|They type {{of objects}} in the collection, {{available}} space, and need for ease of accessibility tend to determine what type of storage system is utilized for a particular collection. There are many generic storage systems that can be purchased and modified to fit {{the needs of a}} specific collection, and this is generally more cost effective than having a system specially built. In small storage areas many institutions will utilize mobile systems that have <b>shelving</b> <b>units</b> on a track, which allows access to a desired aisle {{while the rest of the}} <b>shelving</b> <b>units</b> are pushed together.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to the lazy susan, particularly in base cabinets, is the blind corner cabinet pull out unit. These pull out and turn, making the attached <b>shelving</b> <b>unit</b> slide into the open area of the cabinet door, thus making the shelves accessible to the user. These units make usable what was once dead space.|$|E
50|$|A food {{rotation}} {{system is a}} front-loading <b>shelving</b> <b>unit</b> that organizes and rotates food cans on a first-in first-out basis (FIFO). An effective food {{rotation system}} is essential for storing food to prepare for catastrophes, preventing foodborne illness and controlling commercial kitchen costs. When used correctly, the first-in first-out food rotation method ensures serving safe food and eliminates spoiled food waste.|$|E
50|$|The Research Exchange {{constitutes}} {{a number of}} integrated yet distinct spaces. An atrium leads into an open plan collaborative study space furnished with sofas, desks and twenty PCs. This area features a ‘creative wall’ {{which can be used}} as a magnetic whiteboard or <b>shelving</b> <b>unit.</b> Digital signage on this wall allows for the display of live feeds, online content and events news.|$|E
50|$|David Batchelor {{has made}} {{colourful}} lightbox installations using salvaged {{bits and pieces}} {{from the streets of}} London. Batchelor takes industrial debris - trolleys, <b>shelving</b> <b>units,</b> factory scrap - and transforms them into frames to hold assemblages of neon, perspex and found shopfront signs.|$|R
50|$|Most {{stores will}} rotate stock {{by moving the}} {{products}} with the earliest dates {{to the front of}} <b>shelving</b> <b>units,</b> which encourages customers to buy them first and hopefully saves them from having to be either marked down or thrown away, both of which would result in financial loss.|$|R
5000|$|Harry Gullichsen's only {{objection}} to the revised design {{was the lack of}} a separate library where he could hold confidential business meetings, for which Aalto proposed a small room screened by movable <b>shelving</b> <b>units</b> which did not reach the ceiling. Aalto suggested that these units could also be used for storing Maire’s art collection - an idea which, he pointed out, should be 'socially supportable as it could be realized in a small, even single room, dwelling' where the inhabitant has ‘a personal relationship to the phenomena of art'. Not surprisingly, this arrangement did not offer the necessary acoustic privacy and the <b>shelving</b> <b>units</b> were permanently sited (although not actually fixed), with one angled to suggest frozen movement; the gap under the ceiling was filled with an undulating glazed screen. ii ...|$|R
50|$|Each <b>shelving</b> <b>unit</b> is {{normally}} {{mounted on a}} level trackway (to eliminate gradients in the supporting floor), {{making it possible to}} move heavy units with minimal effort. Mobile shelving can be moved manually or by the use of electrical motors. The track/flooring can either sit on top of an existing floor or be integrated into raised access flooring allowing for a smooth transition between unit and surrounding floor levels.|$|E
5000|$|Thoresby House is a four story Edwardian Period {{building}} {{which consists}} of about 34 students and one Graduate Resident who lives on-site. The building consists primarily of single dormitory-style rooms with one larger double room on each floor. Each student room is furnished with a single bed, student desk, chair, desk lamp, <b>shelving</b> <b>unit,</b> wardrobe closet, small refrigerator, and sink with mirror. Communication services include a telephone with personal voice mail and 'wired' Internet access.|$|E
50|$|Ruth - Ruth mounted her {{brackets}} for her <b>shelving</b> <b>unit</b> backwards (with the bracket on top {{rather than}} underneath), {{and decides to}} brace {{the back of her}} cabinet (meaning that the cabinet was no longer flush with the wall. Furthermore, her hinge installation was on in an awkward manner, with half the hinge on the inside and the other half on the outside, meaning that opening and shutting the door (which would not close all the way) would amount to an attempt at ripping the hinge apart.|$|E
50|$|On the interior, {{the first}} story {{contains}} much of the original store interior finish, including a board ceiling, the original floor, some of the <b>shelving</b> <b>units,</b> and one sales counter. Several carbide and kerosene lamps are still in their locations. On the second floor, the living quarters have been extensively modernized.|$|R
50|$|The museum's public {{displays}} {{are housed}} in the permanent gallery, with another gallery housing temporary and traveling exhibits. The collections are held in the repository, not open to the public, which features 14 ft, fully motorized compactor <b>shelving</b> <b>units.</b> The Collections Repository holds many paleontological and archaeological collections of Riverside County projects.|$|R
50|$|The carton flow {{design has}} gone through countless changes over the years, and has now evolved to full <b>shelving</b> <b>units.</b> These units consist of {{polyethylene}} or aluminum roller runways and can be stand-alone racks or can be installed into pallet racks. Conveyor systems are sometimes used as an alternate option to carton flow shelving.|$|R

50|$|Planograms {{are mostly}} used in retail. A planogram defines where {{and in what}} {{quantity}} products are placed on a <b>shelving</b> <b>unit.</b> The rules and theories {{for the creation of}} a planogram are set under the terms of merchandising. Manufacturers often send planograms to stores ahead of new products. This is useful when a retailer wants multiple store displays to have the same look and feel. Often, a consumer-packaged goods manufacturer will release a new suggested planogram with their new product to show how the product relates to existing products.|$|E
50|$|The Motorized Shelf - The contestants must {{install a}} <b>shelving</b> <b>unit</b> that raises and lowers using an {{electrical}} motor. Key to passing is locating the ceiling joists, which Matt finds easily with small drill holes with a screw (instead of a drill bit) {{after failing to}} find the joists with a stud finder. Assembly quickly follows, and he passes easily. The others, in finding the joists, make much larger holes: Angela and Simon with drywall saws, Deen and Cory with sledgehammers. Because {{of the cost of}} repairing the plastered ceiling, the rest fail even if their shelves function. Deen, however, also fails as he decides to cut his mounting bracket, voiding the unit's warranty. Simon fails due to running out of time.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} materials can be assembled {{in any way}} they builder chooses. The company provides some templates which would allow the builders to create household furniture such as <b>shelving</b> <b>units,</b> tables, desks, catering stations, and bars. Some commercial applications have included using the blocks to construct interior building partitions, where larger spaces {{can be divided into}} multiple workspaces, cubicles, and entire offices.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few days}} later the first {{characters}} {{to be involved in}} the tornado plot were revealed to be newcomer Daniel Robinson (Tim Phillipps) and his girlfriend Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow), whose [...] "honeymoon period" [...] comes to a halt by a revelation during the storm. As Amber and Daniel experienced their first full argument, the storm intensified and the tornado ripped the roof off their car, forcing them to seek shelter in the garage. At the same time, Daniel's uncle, Paul (Stefan Dennis), tried to find him and Amber, after realising that he overstepped the mark by telling Amber about Daniel's ex-girlfriend and how she inspired his tattoo. When the visibility got worse, Paul ended up hitting something with his car. Shortly after, he collided with runaway skip and had to be rescued by Daniel and Amber. When a <b>shelving</b> <b>unit</b> collapsed in the garage, Daniel pulled Amber out of the way and became [...] "inspired by the near miss", so he proposed to her.|$|E
50|$|Spencer, an {{employee}} in a chemical factory, found a puddle {{shaped like a}} body while at work.When the CSI team came in, they already have their first three suspects: Spencer, Holly, another colleague, and the manager, Dean Colton.Having told that a certain employee named Philip has gone missing, the team discovers that the acid puddle was from Philip's body.They next search out over Dean Colton's office. From the evidence, Philip {{was found to be}} lazy worker. He also threatens Dean to make a complaint through an agency, which can put Dean's office in jeopardy. Then, they went through Holly's Office to investigate some files. In the evidence found, the files point out that they must search out over the <b>shelving</b> <b>unit</b> over the place where the puddle is. Dust voids were found and this proves that the tub full of hydrochloric acid hits Philip and pours onto his body. A nail with a strand of hair, which belongs to Spencer, was also found above which leads him to involuntary manslaughter. He did this when taking a nap above.|$|E
50|$|All the masonry {{walls are}} plastered, {{and on the}} first floor the non-masonry walls are lath and plaster. The {{ceilings}} are lath and plaster, and all rooms have plaster cornices, with the widths and designs varying in different rooms. Principal rooms have ornate central plaster ceiling roses, with the dining room containing two roses which would have been positioned above a central table. Throughout the building, the skirtings, architraves, doors and floor boards are cedar. Doors are panelled with etched, arched glass fanlights, and evidence of early decoration include brackets for curtain rods.The drawing room originally had a white marble fireplace surround with relief carving of fruit, and the dining room had a black marble fireplace surround, both of which have been removed. The main bedroom, on the south, has a cedar fireplace surround and evidence of a <b>shelving</b> <b>unit</b> which was located between the chimney breast and adjacent wall but was probably not an original fitting. The adjacent ante-room housed a bathroom, and surviving evidence include vertically jointed timber panelling and a cedar surround for a shower rose. The bathroom originally housed a slate bath and flushing toilet. The northern bedroom has a vertically jointed timber partition wall which divides the room in two but which does not reach the ceiling height. This room had a cedar fireplace surround which has been removed, but the register grate is in place. The adjacent ante-room is thought to have been a nursery or dressing room.|$|E

40|$|I {{was wearing}} mittens because the {{warehouse}} was cold as hell so maybe I didn’t have {{as good a}} grip on the forklift’s wheel as I thought I did when I slipped my blades into the skip, and somebody must have got the load off-center because when I lifted, the forks hadn’t gone all the way in, and the TVs—the flat screens, plasmas break if you just fart in their general direction—sort of slouched on the pallet at about three feet up. So I sped up to try to force the fork all the way in. That’s when I kinda tossed ‘em into the <b>shelving</b> <b>unit</b> that tipped and hit another <b>shelving</b> <b>unit</b> that tipped too, but luckily there was a wall next, so it wasn’t nearly {{as bad as it}} could have been...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The {{relevance}} of the topic {{is determined by the}} wide using of suspended bed apparatus during the heat treatment of dispersed materials. Materials and methods. Analytical studies were carried out using the classical provisions of gas and fluid mechanics and technical fluid mechanics. Physical experiment was done on the development of industrial design multistage shelf device. Results and discussion. The mathematical model to calculate the residence time of a particle in <b>shelving</b> <b>unit</b> is developed, its adequacy confirmed by experimental studies. The model can be applied for the drying, cooling, granulation processes calculation. The residence time of a single particle on a shelf in operating mode from 2 to 20 seconds, depending on the constructive execution shelf and the gas flow rate. The mutual influence of particles during their stay on the shelf increased by an average of 40 times. For the regime of particle motion in fluidized bed (constricted movement) the maximum time can be up to 20 minutes. Changing the angle of the shelf and its length has little influence as compared with a change in the hydrodynamic regime of gas flow. Design of shelf significantly affect the residence time of the particles in the apparatus only in compressed motion regime. This work theoretically and experimentally proved the existence of different regimes shelf apparatus. Conclusions. The influence mechanism of design shelf and hydrodynamic regime of the gas flow on particle residence time in multistage gravity shelf apparatus is established. The research results are the basis of engineering calculation of equipment with a vertical sectioning of the workspace...|$|E
50|$|A typical bank {{of mobile}} office <b>shelving</b> <b>units</b> offer close to 50% {{reduction}} of floor space or a 50% to 100% increase in storage space compared to traditional filing cabinets. The ability to concertina individual units until touching means space is only required between units {{when they are}} being accessed by users. Applications with {{a greater number of}} simultaneous users may require more access spaces (aisles), thus not approaching this 50% target so closely.|$|R
