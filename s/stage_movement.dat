Trained in modern dance, she is {{credited}} in the Bayreuth programs with choreography for Parsifal, Tannhäuser, and Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, but in fact she assisted him {{in all of his}} Bayreuth productions and many that he staged elsewhere, sometimes taking rehearsals on her own. This was not revealed until after Wieland's death, and Wolfgang Wagner claims in his memoirs that it's not true. But biographer Renate Schostack recounts many particulars of this collaboration, as does the daughter of Wieland and Gertrud, Nike Wagner.|$|E

40|$|Anyone who {{has learned}} how to play a musical {{instrument}} knows that translating notes on a sheet into finger movements is effortful at first, but gradually becomes more automatic over time. This widely appreciated feature of motor learning was described in 1967 by Paul Fitts and Michael Posner. In a book entitled Human Performance, the well-known psychologists pro-posed three stages of learning motor skills: a cognitive phase, an associative phase, and an autonomous phase. In the first <b>stage,</b> <b>movements</b> are slow, inconsistent, and inefficient, and {{large parts of the}} movement are controlled consciously. In the second <b>stage,</b> <b>movements</b> become more fluid, reli-able, and efficient, and some parts of the movement are controlled automatically. And in the third <b>stage,</b> <b>movements</b> are accurate, consistent, and efficient, and movement is largely con-trolled automatically. However, it has not been clear exactly how the different stages of motor learning map onto neural systems in the brain. In a study published in this issue of PLOS Biology, Nicolas Schweighofer of the University of Southern California and Hiroshi Imamizu of the University of Tokyo combined computational modeling with behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to create...|$|R

[...] Green took over Lytton's nine patter roles until Lytton's return about two months later. Afterwards, two of the roles – Major-General Stanley in Pirates and Robin Oakapple in Ruddigore – were assigned to Green permanently in 1932. He also began substituting more frequently for Lytton in the role of Jack Point. [...] In 1934, Lytton's retirement left Green as the principal comedian of the D'Oyly Carte company, playing all of the comic roles in their repertory over the next five years. Green gained enthusiastic notices for, among other things, his excellent diction and comedic <b>stage</b> <b>movement,</b> despite the World War I injury to his left knee. Green finally added John Wellington Wells in The Sorcerer to his long list of roles when the company revived that work in 1938, and he appeared in the film version of The Mikado in the role of Ko-Ko in 1939. His director in the film, Victor Schertzinger, said of Green: [...] "He has that special sort of comedian's quality that only Chaplin has so far developed to perfection.

30|$|Slopes are {{subjected}} to stress redistributions during underground mining activities, and this may eventually cause deformation or landslide. This paper takes Madaling landslide in Guizhou Province, China {{as a case study}} to investigate the failure mechanism and its run-out behaviours by using discrete element method. Previous qualitative analysis indicated that the slope experienced four stages of failure mechanisms: (1) development of tension cracks, (2) development of stepped-like creep cracks, (3) development of potential rupture surfaces, and (4) occurrence of the landslide. PFC 2 D program was employed to model the pre-failure deformation characteristics in order to verify the failure mechanisms quantitatively. Subsequently, the run-out behaviours of the landslide were analyzed by PFC 3 D program. The results indicated that the movement could be summarized into four stages: acceleration <b>stage,</b> constant <b>movement</b> <b>stage,</b> rapid <b>movement</b> <b>stage,</b> and deceleration and deposition stage.|$|R

30|$|The failure {{propagation}} {{of the slope}} was subsequently modeled by a three-dimensional discrete element analysis (PFC 3 D). A reduction factor of 0.3 {{was applied to the}} mechanical properties obtained from the laboratory experiments to account for deteriorations of rock structures caused by the fractures and cracks developed in the slope. In addition, residual stresses were mobilized during the debris flow. The mass movement during the landslide occurrence can be categorized into four stages, namely acceleration <b>stage,</b> constant <b>movement</b> <b>stage,</b> rapid <b>movement</b> <b>stage,</b> and deceleration and deposition stage. Although the simulation results could not explain the mechanism of shear strength reduction of the materials, the simulation successfully provided scenario-based run-out paths, sliding velocity and affected area. These information are useful for assessing the potential landslide hazard of another slope (Jieniangping slope) which is located at about 400  m away from the present failed slope and had shown signs of failures.|$|R
