25|$|Mitotic cyclin-CDK complexes, {{which are}} {{synthesized}} but inactivated during S and G2 phases, promote {{the initiation of}} mitosis by stimulating downstream proteins involved in chromosome condensation and mitotic <b>spindle</b> <b>assembly.</b> A critical complex activated during this process is a ubiquitin ligase known as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which promotes degradation of structural proteins associated with the chromosomal kinetochore. APC also targets the mitotic cyclins for degradation, ensuring that telophase and cytokinesis can proceed.|$|E
25|$|Docetaxel {{exhibits}} cytotoxic {{activity on}} breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, gastric, renal and prostate cancer cells. Docetaxel does not block disassembly of interphase microtubules {{and so does}} not prevent entry into the mitotic cycle, but does block mitosis by inhibiting mitotic <b>spindle</b> <b>assembly.</b> Resistance to paclitaxel or anthracycline doxorubicin does not necessarily indicate resistance to docetaxel. Microtubules formed {{in the presence of}} docetaxel are of a larger size than those formed in the presence of paclitaxel, which may result in improved cytotoxic efficacy. Abundant formation of microtubules and the prevention to replicate caused by the presence of docetaxel leads to apoptosis of tumour cells and is the basis of docetaxel use as a cancer treatment. It is unknown if pathophysiological interactions with docetaxel exist at this stage, however tumour type has been shown to have efficacy on cellular activity. Docetaxel activity is significantly greater in ovarian and breast tumours than for lung tumours.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} MTs {{attached}} to one kinetochore is variable: in Saccharomyces cerevisiae only one MT binds each kinetochore, whereas in mammals {{there can be}} among 15-35 MTs bound to each kinetochore. However, not all the MTs in the spindle attach to one kinetochore. There are MTs that extend from one centrosome to the other (and {{they are responsible for}} spindle length) and some shorter ones are interdigitated between the long MTs. Professor B. Nicklas (Duke University), showed that, if one breaks down the MT-kinetochore attachment using a laser beam, chromatids can no longer move, leading to an abnormal chromosome distribution. These experiments also showed that kinetochores have polarity, and that kinetochore attachment to MTs emanating from one or the other centrosome will depend on its orientation. This specificity guarantees that only one chromatid will move to each spindle side, thus ensuring the correct distribution of the genetic material. Thus, one of the basic functions of the kinetochore is the MT attachment to the spindle, which is essential to correctly segregate sister chromatids. If anchoring is incorrect, errors may ensue, generating aneuploidy, with catastrophic consequences for the cell. To prevent this from happening, there are mechanisms of error detection and correction (as the <b>spindle</b> <b>assembly</b> checkpoint), whose components reside also on the kinetochores.The movement of one chromatid towards the centrosome is produced primarily by MT depolymerization in the binding site with the kinetochore. These movements require also force generation, involving molecular motors likewise located on the kinetochores.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of small chemical inhibitors of human Kinesin-5 through a pioneering in vitro phenotypic screening on cancer cell lines {{has led to}} both {{the development of new}} anticancer therapeutic agents, and to novel tools to probe the mechanism of microtubule motor proteins. [...] This toolkit of allosteric inhibitors has been used to probe the specific role of Kinesin-5 in mitotic <b>spindle</b> <b>assembly</b> [...] as well as fine dissection of motor domain function. [...] Through this work it was found that, in mammalian cells, Kinesin-5 is required for the initial assembly of the mitotic spindle during prophase and prometaphase, but is dispensable to traverse subsequent anaphase during a round of mitosis. [...] Also, the binding of the Kinesin-5 inhibitors to an allosteric site on the motor interrupts the mechanism by which this enzyme converts the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into the mechanical work of moving microtubules, thus providing insight on how this enzyme works.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} models {{that attempt to}} explain the {{self-assembly}} of the mitotic spindle based upon microtubules as a structural element, {{and a set of}} microtubule motors, including Kinesin-5 to move and order them. [...] Many of these models attempt to explain the steady state of the spindle at metaphase based on a predicted balance of motor forces acting in opposition within the spindle microtubules. Still, {{it is not clear whether}} all the structural elements required for <b>spindle</b> <b>assembly</b> are known, or how the motors, including Kinesin-5, might be regulated in space and time. [...] Such caveats make assessment of such models difficult. [...] Recent data, however, finds that aspects of the ‘force balance’ model that posit spindle length and stability to be mediated by a balance between the minus-end directed microtubule sliding and plus-end directed microtubule sliding by opposing motors in insect cells, seems not to be the case in mammalian cells. [...] The process of self-assembly of the mitotic spindle remains a major unsolved question in cell biology, and a robust model awaits further details of the regulation and behavior of various microtubule motors and structural elements that compose this machinery.|$|E

2500|$|Paclitaxel is one {{of several}} cytoskeletal drugs that target tubulin. Paclitaxel-treated cells have defects in mitotic <b>spindle</b> <b>assembly,</b> {{chromosome}} segregation, and cell division. Unlike other tubulin-targeting drugs such as colchicine that inhibit microtubule assembly, paclitaxel stabilizes the microtubule polymer and protects it from disassembly. Chromosomes are thus unable to achieve a metaphase spindle configuration.

40|$|Spindle {{elongation}} in anaphase of mitosis is a cell cycle-regulated {{process that}} requires coordination between polymerization, cross-linking, and sliding of microtubules (MTs). Proteins that assemble at the spindle midzone {{may be important}} for this process. In this study, we show that Ase 1 and the separase-Slk 19 complex drive midzone assembly in yeast. Whereas the conserved MT-bundling protein Ase 1 establishes a midzone, separase-Slk 19 is required to focus and center midzone components. An important step leading to <b>spindle</b> midzone <b>assembly</b> is the dephosphorylation of Ase 1 by the protein phosphatase Cdc 14 {{at the beginning of}} anaphase. Failure to dephosphorylate Ase 1 delocalizes midzone proteins and delays the second, slower phase of anaphase B. In contrast, in cells expressing nonphosphorylated Ase 1, anaphase spindle extension is faster, and spindles frequently break. Cdc 14 also controls the separase-Slk 19 complex indirectly via the Aurora B kinase. Thus, Cdc 14 regulates <b>spindle</b> midzone <b>assembly</b> and function directly through Ase 1 and indirectly via the separase-Slk 19 complex...|$|R
50|$|PRC1 dimers, {{required}} for the high-affinity interaction with Kinesin-4, recruit Kinesin-4 to regions of antiparallel microtubule overlap, where Kinesin-4, a plus-end directed motor protein that inhibits microtubule dynamics, helps to form length-dependent end tags that help stabilize and regulate <b>spindle</b> microtubule <b>assembly</b> within cytokinesis. This PRC1-Kinesin-4 complex differentially identifies and regulates the spindle midzone microtubules during cell division. This regulation is crucial in order for cytokinesis to progress properly.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Vinblastine is a vinca {{alkaloid}} {{that binds}} to tubulin and inhibits microtubule formation in cells. Vinblastine treatment {{results in the}} formation of paracrystalline aggre-gates in the cells, which are formed from tightly packed tubulin molecules. Mitotic <b>spindle</b> <b>assemblies</b> in treated cells are disrupted and cell cycle progression is arrested at the mitosis phase. Vinblastine is therefore widely used for cancer treatment. However, the mechanism underlying para-crystal formation has not been fully elucidated. The present study attempted to observe paracrystal formation in human A 549 cells. Initally, paracrystal formation was detected using the anti-tubulin antibody. Secondly, the exogenousuly expressed RFP-conjugated tubulin also formed paracrystals. Additionally, immunostaining with the anti-RBM 8 A anti-body overlapped with paracrystal images obtained from RFP conjugated tubulin. This suggested that the localization of the RBM 8 A proteins was adjacent to the tubulin molecules prior to vinblastine treatment. Furthermore, a time-lapse analysis was developed for paracrystal formation in viable human A 549 cells. This was achieved using exogenous expression of fluorescent proteins conjugated with tubulin and time‑lapse microscopy. It may be concluded that the indicated method was successful for the real-time analysis of paracrystal forma-tion in human cells...|$|R

40|$|Kinesins are {{a diverse}} {{superfamily}} of motor proteins that drive organelles and other microtubule-based movements in eukaryotic cells. These motors play {{important roles in}} multiple events during both interphase and cell division. Dictyostelium discoideum contains 13 kinesin motors, 12 of which are grouped into nine families, plus one orphan. Functions for 11 of the 13 motors have been previously investigated; we address here {{the activities of the}} two remaining kinesins, both isoforms with central motor domains. Kif 6 (of the kinesin- 13 family) appears to be essential for cell viability. The partial knockdown of Kif 6 with RNA interference generates mitotic defects (lagging chromosomes and aberrant <b>spindle</b> <b>assemblies)</b> that are consistent with kinesin- 13 disruptions in other organisms. However, the orphan motor Kif 9 participates in a completely novel kinesin activity, one that maintains a connection between the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and nucleus during interphase. kif 9 null cell growth is impaired, and the MTOC appears to disconnect from its normally tight nuclear linkage. Mitotic spindles elongate in a normal fashion in kif 9 − cells, but we hypothesize that this kinesin is important for positioning the MTOC into the nuclear envelope during prophase. This function would be significant for the early steps of cell division and also {{may play a role in}} regulating centrosome replication...|$|R
