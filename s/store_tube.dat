5000|$|The Mark 1 used a 20-bit word {{stored as}} a single line of dots of {{electric}} charges settled {{on the surface of}} a Williams tube display, each cathodic <b>tube</b> <b>storing</b> 64 lines of dots. Instructions were stored in a single word, while numbers were stored in two words. The main memory consisted of eight <b>tubes,</b> each <b>storing</b> one such page of 64 words.

The accumulator could also be addressed as two 40-bit words. An extra 20-bit word per <b>tube</b> <b>stored</b> an offset value into the secondary storage. Secondary storage was provided in the form of a 512-page magnetic drum, storing two pages per track, with about 30 milliseconds revolution time.

40|$|Assays {{detecting}} antigen (Ag) -specific T-cell {{responses in}} immune-mediated processes are increasingly employed to understand disease pathogenesis and "immune staging". The {{quantity and quality}} of starting peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) preparations are important factors in the performance of such assays. We therefore compared final PBMC yield and function by modifying parameters at the blood drawing, storage and processing steps. While drawing blood in vacuum-driven tubes or syringes and separating PBMCs on density gradients using standard or membrane (Leucosep (R)) tubes made no difference, <b>storing</b> <b>tubes</b> for 18 h without any agitation led to PBMC preparations contaminated with granulocytes and decreased interferon (IFN) -gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) responses. Even agitated blood showed a trend towards reduced ELISpot responses and increased human leukocyte Ag (HLA) multimer readouts when stored for 18 h compared to 3 h. These changes were reduced by diluting blood prior to storage. Washing PBMCs with media containing 10 % human serum increased PBMC yields by 40. 5 %, without affecting ELISpot responses and multimer counts. However, washes with > 10 % human serum decreased multimer counts, with no additional improvement in PBMC yields. These findings may be relevant for optimizing and harmonizing PBMC processing procedures for T-cell assays. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Background: Accurate {{quantification}} of mRNA {{in whole}} blood is made difficult by the simultaneous degradation of gene transcripts and unintended gene induction caused by sample handling or uncontrolled activation of coagulation. This {{study was designed}} to compare a new blood collection tube (PAXgene TM Blood RNA System) and a companion sample preparation reagent set with a traditional sample collection and preparation method for the purpose of gene expression analysis. Methods: We collected parallel blood samples from healthy donors into the new sample collection tubes and control EDTA tubes and performed serial RNA extractions on samples stored for 5 days at room temperature and for up to 90 days at 4 and 20 °C. Samples were analyzed by Northern blot analysis or reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Results: Specific mRNA concentrations in blood <b>stored</b> in EDTA <b>tubes</b> at any temperature changed substantially, as determined by high-precision RT-PCR. These changes were eliminated or markedly reduced when whole blood was <b>stored</b> in PAXgene <b>tubes.</b> Loss of specific mRNAs, as measured by RT-PCR, reflected total RNA depletion as well as specific mRNA destruction demonstrated by Northern blot analysis. The salutary effects of PAXgene on mRNA stabilization extended to blood samples from eight unrelated donors.

To avoid overheating the tubes it is necessary to either pump the circuit for a short time after the sun, or else to provide a large reservoir of fluid in the header above the tubes.
