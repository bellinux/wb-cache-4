40|$|Risk {{assessment}} for pesticides in the aquatic environment {{relies on a}} comparison between estimated exposure concentrations in <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> and endpoints {{from a series of}} effect tests. Many field- and catchment-scale models have been developed, ranging from simple empirical models to comprehensive, physically- based, distributed models that require complex parameterisation, often through inverse modelling methods. Routine use of catchment models for assessment and management of pesticides requires a tool that is comprehensive in being able to address all major routes of entry of pesticides into <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> and that has reasonable parameter requirements. Current models either focus primarily on transport of pesticides in surface runoff or are restricted in application because they require calibration against data from detailed monitoring programmes.
