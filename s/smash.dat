5|$|In the two out {{of three}} falls tag team match, Crush and <b>Smash</b> {{represented}} Demolition against the team of Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart. Both teams relied on brawling tactics during the first fall, which was awarded to Demolition when they pinned Hart after performing the Demolition Decapitation. They continued to wear down Hart until Neidhart tagged back into the match. He and Hart took turns attacking <b>Smash</b> before performing the Hart Attack. Before they could pin him, however, Crush prevented the referee from making a pinfall count, which resulted in a disqualification. During the third fall, Demolition distracted the referee, enabling Ax, their third member, to come to hide at ringside. When <b>Smash</b> was knocked out of the ring, Ax took his place while <b>Smash</b> hid. Well rested, Ax used his power to control the match against Hart. Ax and <b>Smash</b> traded places again, but the Legion of Doom appeared and pulled Ax out from under the ring. With <b>Smash</b> distracted, Hart and Neidhart were able to tackle Crush and pin him to win the match and the WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|Meta Knight {{also appears}} in three {{installments}} of the Super <b>Smash</b> Bros. video game series; in Super <b>Smash</b> Bros. Melee, he {{appears in the}} form of a trophy, and in Super <b>Smash</b> Bros. Brawl, he is a playable character. However, Meta Knight was removed from professional gaming competitions in the United States and Canada due to being considered too powerful. Meta Knight returned as a playable character in Super <b>Smash</b> Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U after the series' director, Masahiro Sakurai, assured some changes to re-add him; among the changes, Meta Knight lost his ability to glide, and his unrivaled attack speed was toned down.|$|E
