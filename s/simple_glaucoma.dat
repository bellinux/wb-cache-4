40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the role of color-Doppler US {{in the assessment of}} orbital vasculature under normal conditions; the results were then applied to the flowmetric analysis of some vascular diseases of the orbit, i. e., retinitis pigmentosa, <b>simple</b> chronic <b>glaucoma,</b> low-tension glaucoma and carotid-cavernous fistulas. The study consisted of two phases: first, a group of 20 healthy volunteers was examined and then 39 patients were divided into 4 subgroups. The patients (18 men and 21 women, age range: 52 - 68 years) were further divided into 4 subgroups: 12 of them had retinitis pigmentosa, 15 <b>simple</b> chronic <b>glaucoma,</b> 8 low-tension glaucoma and 4 carotid-cavernous fistulas. Color-Doppler yielded useful pieces of information on the position of orbital vessels and flow direction, while pulsed Doppler allowed the measurement of several variables, i. e., time average velocity, protosystolic velocity, peak systolic velocity, mesodiastolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, resistive index and pulsatility index. The study of the 20 healthy volunteers yielded valuable information on the anatomy and flow patterns of some vessels, such as the ophthalmic artery, the central retinal artery, the lacrimal artery and the posterior ciliary arteries, all of them visible in 90 - 100 % of patients; the central retinal vein, the superior ophthalmic vein and venae varicosae were demonstrated in about 10 - 30 % of them. In the group of patients, the mean flow velocities of the examined arteries were significantly lower than those in the normal volunteers; in the patients with carotid-cavernous fistulas an ectasic superior ophthalmic vein was demonstrated, with its typical flow "arterialization" pattern. The results suggest that color-Doppler could play a mayor role in the study of ocular hemodynamics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Glaucoma is a {{major cause}} of {{blindness}} worldwide and an increasingly significant global health problem. Glaucoma prevention and management efforts have been challenging due to inherent difficulty in developing a simple and cost-effective screening plan, limited access to health care and educational resources, poverty, and inadequate knowledge of the disease, particularly in developing countries. Starting in 2004 the Tilganga Eye Centre in Kathmandu, Nepal has provided targeted glaucoma screening, treatment, and education through a combination of clinical outreach programs and educational activities for patients. Methods A <b>simple,</b> age-based <b>glaucoma</b> screening algorithm was incorporated into three one-day cataract screening clinics. Using this algorithm, patients who were newly diagnosed with glaucoma were referred to TEC, where medication and surgery were provided free of charge through private donor funding. In addition, we describe two ongoing educational programs for increasing glaucoma awareness: an annual Glaucoma Awareness Week (which includes free screening, treatment, and counseling), and a repeating lecture series which generates new counselors. Results From 2004 to 2007 screening at the annual Glaucoma Awareness Week resulted in the diagnosis of 120 individuals with glaucoma, or 7. 6 % of total registrants. Attendance increased annually with a trend toward an increasing number of returning patients but a decreasing percentage of newly diagnosed patients, though the absolute numbers have remained relatively stable (range 21 to 38). Data from the three one-day screening clinics in 2006 show that approximately 2 to 4 % of patients 50 years of age or older per clinic were newly diagnosed with POAG. Conclusion This multi-faceted approach appears to successfully identify individuals with glaucoma and provide treatment to those who would otherwise {{not be able to afford}} it. While more data is needed to validate this model, specifically regarding the effectiveness of educational activities, long-term visual outcomes, and medication compliance, it may serve as a useful framework for other developing countries with similarly limited resources. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Î²âadrenergic antagonists are {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed drugs for glaucoma. However, these drugs can be absorbed into the systemic circulation through the naso-lacrimal duct to produce various systemic side effects.

Low-tension glaucoma patients demonstrated focal sector hypoperfusion of the optic nerve in every case, while the chronic <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> patients demonstrated a wide range of optic nerve fluorescence, suggesting both focal and diffuse optic nerve head hypoperfusion. It was concluded that, while focal hypoperfusion of the optic nerve may reflect susceptible vasculature at the nerve head with or without intraocular pressure elevation, diffuse hypoperfusion suggested that prolonged intraocular pressure elevation may simultaneously affect the whole of the optic nerve head.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{prevalence}} and mode of inheritance of major genetic eye diseases {{have been investigated}} in China since {{the establishment of the}} Section of Ophthalmic Genetics of the Chinese Society of Genetics. Mass screening of genetic eye diseases has been undertaken in many districts in China, covering more than 700 000 people, and more than 5000 pedigrees of genetic eye diseases have been collected and analysed all over China. Based on these data, the {{prevalence and}} mode of inheritance of dyschromatopsia, degenerative myopia, retinitis pigmentosa, congenital ptosis, congenital microphthalmos, congenital cataract, congenital glaucoma, Leber's optic atrophy, corneal dystrophy, congenital nystagmus, coloboma of the eye, congenital aniridia, retinoblastoma, macular dystrophy, <b>simple</b> myopia, primary <b>glaucoma,</b> and strabismus have been investigated, and the results are presented. The Section of Ophthalmic Genetics of the Chinese Society of Genetics was established in 1979. Before 1979, few ophthalmologists paid attention to the field of ophthalmic genetics, but since then an increasing number of ophthalmic genetic clinics and laboratories have been established in China. In June 1980, the First Chinese Congress of Ophthalmic Genetics was held.

40|$|Background: To improve {{safety of}} {{phacoemulsification}} cataract surgery, innovative technologies have been developed. Assessment of macular region status after {{the use of}} routine and innovative phaco technologies is of great interest. Â  Aim: To compare effects of different phaco technologies on macular retina, visual acuity and intraocular pressure in patients with compensated glaucoma after uncomplicated phaco with intraocular lens implantation. Â  Materials and methods: Phacoemulsification of immature cataract was performed in 52 Â  patients (52 Â eyes) using Oertli machine and uniform method. Patients were divided into 3 Â groups. GroupÂ  1 included 20 Â  patients (20 Â  eyes) with <b>simple</b> (primary) openangle <b>glaucoma</b> (POAG) after phaco using easyPhaco technology. GroupÂ  2 included 20 Â  POAG patients (20 Â  eyes) after phaco using routine technology. GroupÂ  3 included 12 Â  patients without glaucoma after routine phaco. EasyPhaco technology involves using of the new Oertli machine parameters, phaco tip with new geometry, flow rate/vacuum setting of 1 : 10. Preoperatively, in all 40 Â patients with glaucoma, normal values of intraocular pressure were achieved using antiglaucomatous therapies. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure and macular thickness by optical coherent tomography were measured before the surgery, in 1 and 6 Â weeks after the procedure. Â  Results: Increase of macular thickness (by 12 â 30 Â  mcm compared to baseline) was observed postoperatively in patients with and without glaucoma. After 1 Â week, mean macular thickness was significantly less in the easyPhaco group compared to routine phaco groups with and without glaucoma (221. 5 Â± 15. 4; 238. 3 Â± 11. 5 and 229. 3 Â± 16. 9 Â mcm,respectively, p < 0. 05). In the groupsÂ  1 andÂ  3, macular thickness returned to preoperative values after 6 Â weeks (groupÂ  1 : 210. 5 Â± 13. 8 and 209. 7 Â± 16. 3 Â mcm; groupÂ  3 : 211. 1 Â± 14. 4 and 211. 1 Â± 15. 8 Â  mcm,respectively). By contrast, after routine phaco technology in POAG patients, macular edema persisted after 6 Â  weeks (mean macular thickness 228. 2 Â± 13. 5 Â  mcm compared to 208. 2 Â± 17. 6 Â  mcm preoperatively). Â  Conclusion: In patients with glaucoma, use of easyPhaco technology is associated with less effects on the retina and less risk of macular edema after the surgery. Â </p...|$|R

A highly significant negative relationship {{was found between the}} presenting visual field coefficient (FC) and the untreated IOP (r = - 0. 26, p = 0. 0001) - that is, the higher the IOP on detection, the worse is the visual field. A weak negative correlation was present between the change of FC per year and the treated IOP (r = - 0. 06), p = less than 0. 05). At treated IOPs {{less than or equal to}} 18 mmHg visual field loss averaged 0. 6 unit per year and for IOPs greater than 18 mmHg the average loss was 1. 2 units per year.

Patients and Methods: Thirty eyes with chronic <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> and 30 nonglaucomatous eyes were studied. Anterior chamber depth, iris-lens contact and iris-zonule distance were measured, in both groups, using ultrasound biomicroscopy, in the three following conditions: without mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation, with 1 % tropicamide alone and with 1 % tropicamide plus 10 % phenylephrine chlorhydrate. Results: Ultrasound biomicroscopy examinations of glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes, without mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation, showed {{no statistically significant difference}} in the central anterior chamber depth, iris-lens contact and iris-zonule distance. The difference between examinations without mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation, with 1 % tropicamide and with 1 % tropicamide plus 10 % phenylephrine chlorhydrate was statistically significant regarding the variables measured in both groups. Conclusions: No anatomical difference was observed between the anterior segment of glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes after mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation. The results of this clinical investigation, using ultrasound biomicroscopy were innovative, allowing a dynamic and quantitative evaluation of the anatomical relationships between intraocular structures when submitted to mydriasis and cycloplegy, which up to now were only qualitative...|$|E
40|$|There is now strong {{evidence}} for a genetic basis to glaucoma. Numerous family histories have been recorded, and Dodinval, Prijot, and Weekers (I 970) consider that at least 20 per cent. of cases of open-angle glaucoma are of a familial and hereditary character. Ad-ditional evidence derives from studies of the families of patients with glaucoma. Kellerman and Posner (1955) examined 192 relatives and detected eight cases of chronic simple glaucoma; Becker, Kolker, and Roth (I 960) examined I IO parents, siblings, and children of patients with chronic <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> and diagnosed the condition in six.

The eye with higher intra-ocular pressure or the larger optic disc cup was treated by early trabeculectomy while the other eye of the same patient was subjected to medical therapy with topical beta blockers for 3 years (without any surgical treatment). Both the eyes of 70 patients were compared after 3 years. Eyes which had undergone trabeculectomy had a mean intra-ocular pressure of 11. 7 mm Hg against 18 mm Hg in the medically treated eyes. Surgically treated eyes had decrease in the mean cup : disc ratio (from 0. 54 : 1 to 0. 48 : 1) whereas medically treated eyes showed an increase from 0. 41 : 1 to 0. 51 : 1. Visual field loss occurred in 3 / 70 operated eyes and in 27 / 70 medically treated eyes. Twenty-one of 70 treated eyes developed cataract and 12 of these required cataract surgery. Only 18 / 70 medically treated eyes developed cataracts but none of these required cataract surgery.

Three eyes experienced progressive visual field loss or disc damage in spite of an intraocular pressure below 22 mmHg without medication. High prelaser pressure and the severity of the visual field defects were significant predictors of treatment failure...|$|E
40|$|The author {{describes}} eye {{problems in}} general practice, from problems appearing in neonates {{to those in}} the elderly. Refractive problems are most common. Visually threatening eye disease that requires urgent treatment or referral is important, despite its rarity. Early detection and treatment of amblyopia is important in children. In diabetic retinopathy, a potentially blinding disease, maculopathy and proliferative retinopathy require immediate referral. Chronic <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> and cataracts cause gradual loss of vision in the older adult. Sudden loss of vision can be caused by optic neuritis, which is occasionally the first sign of multiple sclerosis. Retinal artery and retinal vein thrombosis are more common in older individuals with vascular disease. One of the most common causes of gradual visual loss in the elderly is senile macular degeneration...|$|E
40|$|Visual loss causes {{enormous}} suffering to {{both the}} patients and their families. About 80 % of blindness is avoidable (preventable or curable). Therefore, we present four cases treated for several years in the low vision consultation of the Gustavo AldereguÃ­a Lima University General Hospital of Cienfuegos due to a functional diversity secondary to various ophthalmologic conditions including high hyperopia, high myopia, chronic <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> at stage 4 and uncorrected aphakia. An extracapsular extraction with intraocular lens implantation was performed, using a primary Piggyback in one of them. All cases showed satisfactory results in various parameters such as visual acuity, visual field and reduced refractive error; thus, {{it was possible to}} improve the quality of life of these patients as well as their social and school inclusion...|$|E
