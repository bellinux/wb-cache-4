40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the role of color-Doppler US {{in the assessment of}} orbital vasculature under normal conditions; the results were then applied to the flowmetric analysis of some vascular diseases of the orbit, i. e., retinitis pigmentosa, <b>simple</b> chronic <b>glaucoma,</b> low-tension glaucoma and carotid-cavernous fistulas. The study consisted of two phases: first, a group of 20 healthy volunteers was examined and then 39 patients were divided into 4 subgroups. The patients (18 men and 21 women, age range: 52 - 68 years) were further divided into 4 subgroups: 12 of them had retinitis pigmentosa, 15 <b>simple</b> chronic <b>glaucoma,</b> 8 low-tension glaucoma and 4 carotid-cavernous fistulas. Color-Doppler yielded useful pieces of information on the position of orbital vessels and flow direction, while pulsed Doppler allowed the measurement of several variables, i. e., time average velocity, protosystolic velocity, peak systolic velocity, mesodiastolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, resistive index and pulsatility index. The study of the 20 healthy volunteers yielded valuable information on the anatomy and flow patterns of some vessels, such as the ophthalmic artery, the central retinal artery, the lacrimal artery and the posterior ciliary arteries, all of them visible in 90 - 100 % of patients; the central retinal vein, the superior ophthalmic vein and venae varicosae were demonstrated in about 10 - 30 % of them. In the group of patients, the mean flow velocities of the examined arteries were significantly lower than those in the normal volunteers; in the patients with carotid-cavernous fistulas an ectasic superior ophthalmic vein was demonstrated, with its typical flow "arterialization" pattern. The results suggest that color-Doppler could play a mayor role in the study of ocular hemodynamics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Glaucoma is a {{major cause}} of {{blindness}} worldwide and an increasingly significant global health problem. Glaucoma prevention and management efforts have been challenging due to inherent difficulty in developing a simple and cost-effective screening plan, limited access to health care and educational resources, poverty, and inadequate knowledge of the disease, particularly in developing countries. Starting in 2004 the Tilganga Eye Centre in Kathmandu, Nepal has provided targeted glaucoma screening, treatment, and education through a combination of clinical outreach programs and educational activities for patients. Methods A <b>simple,</b> age-based <b>glaucoma</b> screening algorithm was incorporated into three one-day cataract screening clinics. Using this algorithm, patients who were newly diagnosed with glaucoma were referred to TEC, where medication and surgery were provided free of charge through private donor funding. In addition, we describe two ongoing educational programs for increasing glaucoma awareness: an annual Glaucoma Awareness Week (which includes free screening, treatment, and counseling), and a repeating lecture series which generates new counselors. Results From 2004 to 2007 screening at the annual Glaucoma Awareness Week resulted in the diagnosis of 120 individuals with glaucoma, or 7. 6 % of total registrants. Attendance increased annually with a trend toward an increasing number of returning patients but a decreasing percentage of newly diagnosed patients, though the absolute numbers have remained relatively stable (range 21 to 38). Data from the three one-day screening clinics in 2006 show that approximately 2 to 4 % of patients 50 years of age or older per clinic were newly diagnosed with POAG. Conclusion This multi-faceted approach appears to successfully identify individuals with glaucoma and provide treatment to those who would otherwise {{not be able to afford}} it. While more data is needed to validate this model, specifically regarding the effectiveness of educational activities, long-term visual outcomes, and medication compliance, it may serve as a useful framework for other developing countries with similarly limited resources. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: β–adrenergic antagonists are {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed drugs for glaucoma. However, these drugs can be absorbed into the systemic circulation through the naso-lacrimal duct to produce various systemic side effects.

Low-tension glaucoma patients demonstrated focal sector hypoperfusion of the optic nerve in every case, while the chronic <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> patients demonstrated a wide range of optic nerve fluorescence, suggesting both focal and diffuse optic nerve head hypoperfusion. It was concluded that, while focal hypoperfusion of the optic nerve may reflect susceptible vasculature at the nerve head with or without intraocular pressure elevation, diffuse hypoperfusion suggested that prolonged intraocular pressure elevation may simultaneously affect the whole of the optic nerve head.

40|$|Background: To improve {{safety of}} {{phacoemulsification}} cataract surgery, innovative technologies have been developed. Assessment of macular region status after {{the use of}} routine and innovative phaco technologies is of great interest.   Aim: To compare effects of different phaco technologies on macular retina, visual acuity and intraocular pressure in patients with compensated glaucoma after uncomplicated phaco with intraocular lens implantation.   Materials and methods: Phacoemulsification of immature cataract was performed in 52   patients (52  eyes) using Oertli machine and uniform method. Patients were divided into 3  groups. Group  1 included 20   patients (20   eyes) with <b>simple</b> (primary) openangle <b>glaucoma</b> (POAG) after phaco using easyPhaco technology. Group  2 included 20   POAG patients (20   eyes) after phaco using routine technology. Group  3 included 12   patients without glaucoma after routine phaco. EasyPhaco technology involves using of the new Oertli machine parameters, phaco tip with new geometry, flow rate/vacuum setting of 1 : 10. Preoperatively, in all 40  patients with glaucoma, normal values of intraocular pressure were achieved using antiglaucomatous therapies. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure and macular thickness by optical coherent tomography were measured before the surgery, in 1 and 6  weeks after the procedure.   Results: Increase of macular thickness (by 12 – 30   mcm compared to baseline) was observed postoperatively in patients with and without glaucoma. After 1  week, mean macular thickness was significantly less in the easyPhaco group compared to routine phaco groups with and without glaucoma (221. 5 ± 15. 4; 238. 3 ± 11. 5 and 229. 3 ± 16. 9  mcm,respectively, p < 0. 05). In the groups  1 and  3, macular thickness returned to preoperative values after 6  weeks (group  1 : 210. 5 ± 13. 8 and 209. 7 ± 16. 3  mcm; group  3 : 211. 1 ± 14. 4 and 211. 1 ± 15. 8   mcm,respectively). By contrast, after routine phaco technology in POAG patients, macular edema persisted after 6   weeks (mean macular thickness 228. 2 ± 13. 5   mcm compared to 208. 2 ± 17. 6   mcm preoperatively).   Conclusion: In patients with glaucoma, use of easyPhaco technology is associated with less effects on the retina and less risk of macular edema after the surgery.  </p...|$|R

Patients and Methods: Thirty eyes with chronic <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> and 30 nonglaucomatous eyes were studied. Anterior chamber depth, iris-lens contact and iris-zonule distance were measured, in both groups, using ultrasound biomicroscopy, in the three following conditions: without mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation, with 1 % tropicamide alone and with 1 % tropicamide plus 10 % phenylephrine chlorhydrate. Results: Ultrasound biomicroscopy examinations of glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes, without mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation, showed {{no statistically significant difference}} in the central anterior chamber depth, iris-lens contact and iris-zonule distance. The difference between examinations without mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation, with 1 % tropicamide and with 1 % tropicamide plus 10 % phenylephrine chlorhydrate was statistically significant regarding the variables measured in both groups. Conclusions: No anatomical difference was observed between the anterior segment of glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes after mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation. The results of this clinical investigation, using ultrasound biomicroscopy were innovative, allowing a dynamic and quantitative evaluation of the anatomical relationships between intraocular structures when submitted to mydriasis and cycloplegy, which up to now were only qualitative...|$|E
40|$|There is now strong {{evidence}} for a genetic basis to glaucoma. Numerous family histories have been recorded, and Dodinval, Prijot, and Weekers (I 970) consider that at least 20 per cent. of cases of open-angle glaucoma are of a familial and hereditary character. Ad-ditional evidence derives from studies of the families of patients with glaucoma. Kellerman and Posner (1955) examined 192 relatives and detected eight cases of chronic simple glaucoma; Becker, Kolker, and Roth (I 960) examined I IO parents, siblings, and children of patients with chronic <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> and diagnosed the condition in six.

Both the eyes of 70 patients were compared after 3 years. Eyes which had undergone trabeculectomy had a mean intra-ocular pressure of 11. 7 mm Hg against 18 mm Hg in the medically treated eyes.

40|$|The author {{describes}} eye {{problems in}} general practice, from problems appearing in neonates {{to those in}} the elderly. Refractive problems are most common. Visually threatening eye disease that requires urgent treatment or referral is important, despite its rarity. Early detection and treatment of amblyopia is important in children. In diabetic retinopathy, a potentially blinding disease, maculopathy and proliferative retinopathy require immediate referral. Chronic <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> and cataracts cause gradual loss of vision in the older adult. Sudden loss of vision can be caused by optic neuritis, which is occasionally the first sign of multiple sclerosis. Retinal artery and retinal vein thrombosis are more common in older individuals with vascular disease. One of the most common causes of gradual visual loss in the elderly is senile macular degeneration...|$|E

Therefore, we present four cases treated for several years in the low vision consultation of the Gustavo Aldereguía Lima University General Hospital of Cienfuegos due to a functional diversity secondary to various ophthalmologic conditions including high hyperopia, high myopia, chronic <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> at stage 4 and uncorrected aphakia. An extracapsular extraction with intraocular lens implantation was performed, using a primary Piggyback in one of them. All cases showed satisfactory results in various parameters such as visual acuity, visual field and reduced refractive error; thus, {{it was possible to}} improve the quality of life of these patients as well as their social and school inclusion...|$|E
