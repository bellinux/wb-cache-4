Two pre-coded questionnaires were distributed to 362 Dental Practitioners (DP's) and 22 Dental Lab Technicians in Khartoum State. The questionnaire was anonymous and consisted of questions on the frequency, quality and types of provisional restorations routinely used in crown and bridge work practice. The results were subjected to probit analysis. Responding dental practitioners were 336 giving an overall respond of (92. 8 %) of the sample, only (26. 5 %) were conservative dentistry specialist. The surveyed dental practitioners were more in health centres (53. 6 %) compared to private clinics (39. 3 %). Dentists preferred both verbal and written prescription as method of communication with dental lab were (52. 4 %), verbal communication (30. 6 %) and preferred written prescriptions communication were (17. 0 %). Provisional restorations were provided by (44. 6 %) the surveyed dentist. Custom made was the most used provisional restoration (61. 1 %), while (29. 3 %) surveyed dentists preferred prefabricated provisional restorations. Zinc oxide eugenol was used by 41. 4 % of surveyed dentists as luting agent far provisional restoration lack of retention was reported as the main technical problem during fabrication of definitive restorations. Results showed a significant relationship between number of years in dental practice and quality of provisional restorations (P = 0. 002).

40|$|The {{state of}} New South Wales (NSW) has about 1500 Registered Surveyors of whom around 900 are active. The average age {{is in the}} mid- 50 s. Fryer (2008) {{identified}} {{that there are more}} Registered Surveyors aged over 60 than under 40. The recent development of BOSSI sponsored workshops has addressed this to a certain extent but the issue remains that not enough graduates are being produced by the two tertiary institutions in NSW to maintain a steady state of Registered Surveyors (Roberts, 2010). A 4 -year Bachelor of Engineering in Surveying qualification can be studied at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney or at the University of Newcastle (UNewc) in Newcastle. A <b>survey</b> <b>technician</b> qualification can be studied at a Tertiary and Further Education (TAFE) campus in Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong and can articulate into either of the University courses. A closer examination reveals that the TAFE institutions face increasing funding pressures, the UNewc will experience staffing issues in the near future and the declining numbers of undergraduate students at UNSW threatens the future of the school. Coupled with this, only one institution in Australia offers the Surveying degree by distance education and many students and companies are choosing this option despite the very high attrition rate. This paper discusses the institutions that offer Surveying degrees leading to Registration or Licensing in Australia and New Zealand and their different circumstances and then focuses on New South Wales. The author then argues against perceptions that study at UNSW is inaccessible or difficult and presents 10 reasons to encourage the profession to support their only Sydney-based tertiary institution. �������� � Universities offering Surveying degrees in Australia / New Zealan...|$|R

The Chemrad reports were developed under subcontract to Science Applications International Corporation for their remedial investigation of these sites for Martin Marietta Energy Systems Environmental Restoration Division. Surveys were performed by Chemrad using the UltraSonic Ranging and Data System (USRADS{reg_sign}), which utilizes ultrasonic triangulation to determine the location of a <b>survey</b> <b>technician</b> {{at the same time that}} radiological monitoring data are telemetered from his instruments to a remote receiving station. Floor monitor and Geiger-Mueller pancake meter results from the USRADS{reg_sign} surveys are shown to be sufficiently precise to reliably detect contamination in excess of the limiting radioactivity value of 1, 000 dpm/ 100 cm{sup 2 } for removable uranium contamination specified in 10 CFR 835 Appendix D. MicroRem meter survey results, also included as part of the USRADS{reg_sign} surveys, indicate that the derived limiting value of 56. 8 {mu}rem/h for penetrating dose at 1 m (corresponding to 100 mrem/{gamma}) was not exceeded. However, both the pancake meter and floor monitor results suggest that surface contamination exceeding 1, 000 dpm/ 100 cm{sup 2 } is not uncommon. Sites in OU 1 and BCVFP were visited, and independent surveys made with hand-held instruments, to confirm conclusions about the USRADS{close_quote} survey results and to verify that these results are from contamination uniformly distributed on the soil surface, and not from discrete sources which are not likely transferred to shoes, vehicles, or clothing...|$|R

Historically, Ardhi University, dates back to 1956 when it started as Surveying Training School offering land <b>surveying</b> <b>technician</b> certificate courses at the present location of Mgulani Salvation Army Camp in Dar es Salaam. In 1958, the School {{was moved to the}} present location (i.e. the Observation Hill). In 1972, the School was transformed to Ardhi Institute. Then the Institute offered two-year diploma programmes in the fields of Land Surveying and Land Management and Valuation. In the same year, a three-year Diploma program in Urban and Rural Planning was introduced. Later in 1975, all the three-year diploma programes were upgraded to Advanced Diplomas. The Building Design and Building Economics courses started in 1976 and 1978 respectively. As pointed out earlier, in 1996 Ardhi Institute was affiliated to the University of Dar es Salaam as a Constituent College of the University; subsequently its name changed to the University College of Lands and Architectural Studies (UCLAS). Within ten (10) years, UCLAS increased the number of academic programmes from six (6) to thirty nine (39). The programmes ranging from diplomas to PhDs were offered by two faculties, that is, the Faculty of Architecture and Planning (FAP) and the Faculty of Lands and Environmental Engineering (FLEE). As a result of these changes, student enrollment increased from only 400 in 1996 to about 1,400 in 2007. At the same time, the number of academic staff with PhD increased from 3 in 1996 to over 60 in 2012. At present there are over 80 PhD holders who have graduated from over 25 universities worldwide. In 2007 Ardhi University came into being following the signing of the Ardhi University Charter by His Excellency the President of United Republic of Tanzania. Concurrently, the structure and number of programmes and academic units has increased significantly. At present, the University comprises four Schools, one Institute and several centres. Schools includes; The School of Architecture,Construction Economics and Management(SACEM), The School of Earth Sciences, Real Estates, Business and Informatics(SERBI), The School of Environmental Science and Technology(SEST), and The School of Spatial Planning and Social Science(SSPSS), alongside Institute of Human Settlements Studies (IHSS).

30|$|More {{than half}} of all repair {{requests}} for IODs (i.e., complications) (Q 13) (Figure  8) involve fracturing of the denture base or denture tooth detachment (53.8 % of all repair requests). The questionnaire also revealed that reconstruction of occlusion because of wear or attrition of denture teeth (24.1 %) is a frequent issue leading to laboratory orders. While the literature includes reports of frequent IOD-related prosthetic complications such as attachment-related compromised retention, detachment or fracturing of denture teeth, relining, and attachment damage [25, 28, 29], this survey showed a somewhat different trend. It can be inferred that these results differ from actual complication trends because they constitute responses to cases sent to labs as repair requests, and because the <b>survey</b> targeted dental <b>technicians.</b> The causes of this phenomenon can be found in responses to other questions as described above. In short, the questionnaire suggested the possibility that inadequate awareness of prosthetics is making IOD complications in Japan more complex, with issues including the comparatively frequent use of resin bases, problems with implant location and orientation, and inadequate consideration of occlusion by dentists.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the ability and practice of spirometry, training of technicians, and spirometry features in primary care centers in Spain, evaluating those located in a rural environment against those in urban areas. Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in 2012 by a telephone survey in 970 primary health care centers in Spain. The centers were divided into rural or urban depending on the catchment population. The <b>survey</b> contacted <b>technicians</b> in charge of spirometry and consisted of 36 questions related to the test that included the following topics: center resources, training doctors and technicians, using the spirometer, bronchodilator test, and the availability of spirometry and maintenance. Results: Although the sample size was achieved in both settings, rural centers (RCs) gave a lower response rate than urban centers (UCs). The number of centers without spirometry in rural areas doubled those in the urban areas. Most centers had between one and two spirometers. However, the number of spirometry tests per week was significantly lower in RCs than in UCs (4 [4. 1 %] vs 6. 9 [5. 7 %], P, 0. 01). The availability of a specific schedule for conducting spirometries was higher in RCs than in UCs (209 [73. 0 %] vs 207 [64. 2 %], P= 0. 003). RCs were more satisfied with the spirometries (7. 8 vs 7. 6, P= 0. 019) and received more training course for interpreting spirometry (41. 0 % vs 33. 2 %, P= 0. 004). The performance of the bronchodilator test showed a homogeneous measure in different ways. The spirometer type and the reference values were unknown to the majority of respondents. Conclusion: This study shows the differences between primary care RCs and UCs in Spain in terms of performing spirometry. The findings in the present study can be used to improve the performance of spirometry in these area...|$|R
