40|$|Chemical {{mutagenesis}} of {{the mouse}} is ongoing in several centers around the world, with varying estimates of mutation rate and number of <b>sites</b> <b>mutable</b> to phenotype. To address these questions, we sequenced ∼ 9. 6 Mb of DNA from G 1 progeny of ethylnitrosourea-treated mice in a large, broad-spectrum screen. We identified 10 mutations at eight unique sites, including six nonsynonymous coding substitutions. This calibrates the nucleotide mutation rate for two mutagenesis centers, implies significance criteria for positional cloning efforts, and provides working estimates of effective genetic target sizes for selected phenotypes...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of the mutations induced by ICR- 170 in both the CYC 1 gene (J. F. Ernst et al. Genetics 111 : 233 - 241, 1985) and the HIS 4 gene (L. Mathison and M. R. Culbertson, Mol. Cell. Biol. 5 : 2247 - 2256, 1985) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were recently shown to be single G. C base-pair insertions at monotonous runs {{of two or more}} G. C base pairs. However, not all sites were equally mutable; in both the CYC 1 and HIS 4 genes there is a single highly <b>mutable</b> <b>site</b> where a G. C base pair is preferentially inserted at a [sequence in text]. Here we report the ICR- 170 mutagen specificity at the SUP 4 -o tyrosine tRNA gene of yeast. Genetic fine structure analysis and representative DNA sequence determination of ICR- 170 -induced mutations revealed that there is also a single highly <b>mutable</b> <b>site</b> in SUP 4 -o and that the mutation is a G. C base-pair insertion at a monotonous run of G. C base pairs. Analysis of DNA sequences encompassing the regions of highly <b>mutable</b> <b>sites</b> for all three genes indicated that the <b>mutable</b> <b>sites</b> are at the bases of potential hairpin structures; this type of structure could not be found at any of the other, less mutable G. C runs in SUP 4, CYC 1, and HIS 4. Based on these results and recent information regarding novel DNA structural conformations, we present a mechanism for ICR- 170 -induced mutagenesis. (i) ICR- 170 preferentially binds to DNA in the beta conformation; factors that increase the temporal stability of this structure, such as adjacent stem-and-loop formation, increase the frequency of ICR- 170 binding; (ii) the observed mutagen specificity reflects formation of a preferred ICR- 170 intercalative geometry at [sequence in text] sites; (iii) during replication or repair, ICR- 170 remains associated with the single-stranded template; (iv) stuttering or strand slippage by the polymerization complex as it encounters the mutagen results in nucleotide duplication; (v) subsequent replication or mismatch repair fixes the insertion into the genome. This mechanism accounts for both the IRC- 170 mutagenic specificity and the molecular basis of the highly <b>mutable</b> <b>sites</b> in S. cerevisiae...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous mutants of Staphylococcus aureus {{resistant}} to rifampin, rifamycin SV, streptovaricin, or streptolydigin were isolated and {{shown to be}} resistant due to chromosomal rather than plasmid mutations. Based on data concerning spontaneous mutation rates, genetic cotransduction rates, and in vitro sensitivity studies, four major antibiotic cross-resistance patterns were found. The genetic markers responsible for these cross-resistance patterns were shown to be separable by transduction. Nonpurified RNA polymerase activity in lysates of mutants showed the same sensitivity to these antibiotics {{as shown by the}} mutants on solid media. A model is proposed explaining possible structure-function relationships involved in the binding of these antibiotics to the RNA polymerase molecule and the mutations resulting in resistance to these antibiotics. This model includes generally overlapping but different-sized binding sites on the RNA polymerase protein coded for by similarly arranged <b>mutable</b> <b>sites</b> on the DNA...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive {{mutations}} are mutations {{that occur}} in nondividing or slowly dividing cells during prolonged nonlethal selection, and {{that appear to be}} specific to the challenge of the selection {{in the sense that the}} only mutations that arise are those that provide a growth advantage to the cell. The issue of the specificity has been controversial because it violates our most basic assumptions about the randomness of mutations with respect to their effect on the cell. Although a variety of experiments in several systems in both bacteria and yeast have claimed to demonstrate that specificity, those experiments have been subjected to a variety of technical criticisms suggesting that the specificity may not be real. Here I use the ebg system to provide evidence that when selection is applied to one specific nucleotide site within a gene, mutation occurs at that site but not at an alternative and equally <b>mutable</b> <b>site</b> within the same gene...|$|R
40|$|A {{conditional}} lethal galE(Ts) -based {{strategy was}} employed in Escherichia coli, first {{to eliminate all}} growth-associated chromosomal reversions in lacZ or forward mutations in lacI/lacO by incubation at the restrictive temperature and subsequently to recover (as papillae) spontaneous mutations that had arisen in the population of nondividing cells after shift to the permissive temperature. Data from lacZ reversion studies in mutator strains indicated that the products of all genes for mismatch repair (mutHLS, dam, uvrD), of some for oxidative damage repair (mutMT), and of that for polymerase proofreading (dnaQ) are required in dividing cells; some others for oxidative damage repair (mutY, nth nei) are required in both dividing and nondividing cells; and those for alkylation damage repair (ada ogt) are required in nondividing cells. The spectrum of lacI/lacO mutations in nondividing cells was distinguished both by lower frequencies of deletions and IS 1 insertions and by the unique occurrence of GC-to-AT transitions at lacO + 5. In the second approach to study mutations that had occurred in nondividing cells, lacI/lacO mutants were selected as late-arising papillae from the lawn of a galE+ strain; once again, transitions at lacO + 5 were detected among the mutants that had been obtained from populations initially grown on poor carbon sources such as acetate, palmitate, or succinate. Our {{results indicate that the}} lacO + 5 <b>site</b> is <b>mutable</b> only in nondividing cells, one possible mechanism for which might be that random endogenous alkylation (or oxidative) damage to DNA in these cells is efficiently corrected by the Ada Ogt (or Nth Nei) repair enzymes at most sites but not at lacO + 5. Furthermore, the late-arising papillae from the second approach were composed almost exclusively of dominant lacI/lacO mutants. This finding lends support to "instantaneous gratification" models in which a spontaneous lesion, occurring at a random site in DNA of a nondividing cell, is most likely to be fixed as a mutation if it allows the cell to immediately exit the nondividing state...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of how natural selection affects asexual mutation rates has been considered since the 1930 s, yet our understanding continues to deepen. The distribution of mutation rates observed in natural bacteria remains unexplained. It {{is well known that}} environmental constancy can favor minimal mutation rates. In contrast, environmental fluctuation (e. g., at period T) can create indirect selective pressure for stronger mutators: genes modifying mutation rate may “hitchhike” to greater frequency along with environmentally favored mutations they produce. This article extends a well-known model of Leigh to consider fitness genes with multiple <b>mutable</b> <b>sites</b> (call the number of such sites α). The phenotypic effect of such a gene is enabled if all sites are in a certain state and disabled otherwise. The effects of multiple deleterious loci are also included (call the number of such loci γ). The analysis calculates the indirect selective effects experienced by a gene inducing various mutation rates for given values of α, γ, and T. Finite-population simulations validate these results and let us examine the interaction of drift with hitchhiking selection. We close by commenting on the importance of other factors, such as spatiotemporal variation, and on the origin of variation in mutation rates...|$|R
40|$|A key {{question}} in evolutionary genetics is why certain mutations or {{certain types of}} mutation make disproportionate contributions to adaptive phenotypic evolution. In principle, the preferential fixation of particular mutations could stem directly from variation in the underlying rate of mutation to function-altering alleles. However, the influence of mutation bias on the genetic architecture of phenotypic evolution is difficult to evaluate because data on rates of mutation to function-altering alleles are seldom available. Here, we report the discovery that a single point mutation at a highly <b>mutable</b> <b>site</b> in the βA-globin gene has contributed to an evolutionary change in hemoglobin (Hb) function in high-altitude Andean house wrens (Troglodytes aedon). Results of experiments on native Hb variants and engineered, recombinant Hb mutants demonstrate that a nonsynonymous mutation at a CpG dinucleotide in the βA-globin gene is responsible for an evolved difference in Hb–O 2 affinity between high- and low-altitude house wren populations. Moreover, patterns of genomic differentiation between high- and low-altitude populations suggest that altitudinal differentiation in allele frequencies at the causal amino acid polymorphism reflects a history of spatially varying selection. The experimental results highlight the influence of mutation rate on the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution by demonstrating that a large-effect allele at a highly <b>mutable</b> CpG <b>site</b> has promoted physiological differentiation in blood O 2 transport capacity between house wren populations that are native to different elevations...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} question investigated {{the notion that}} the fixed scopic regime of the surveyor places landscape in the position of other, at a distance, and creates a set of value systems based entirely upon a scene’s picturable qualities, the worthiness of the view. This research prompted the necessity to explore other ways of engaging with the landscape through photographic practice to engender a greater sense of involvement, not only with the sublime areas of National Parks but with the ordinary, the ‘typicalities’, the hedgerows, the lowland peat- bogs and the grasslands. The work engaged with these ideas in two ways: firstly the camera was positioned at ground level and in familiar places; and secondly there was an attempt {{to move away from the}} authority of Cartesian perspective and the fixed vision of the gaze, to a more fluid and obscure representation of the subject. The landscape photographs published do not seek the purity of the wilderness or the authority of the view, but concentrate on the familiar, the home ground and the private; intimate personal landscapes, places to look out from and not at. The places of the imagery are unfixed, <b>mutable,</b> <b>sites</b> that remain unable to be categorised. The use of lightweight cameras with plastic lenses, with very low resolution, strips away the formality of the image, and defies the production of maximum detail...|$|R
40|$|The process {{designated}} RIP (repeat-induced point mutation) alters duplicated DNA sequences in {{the sexual}} cycle of Neurospora crassa. We tested whether non-Neurospora sequences are susceptible to RIP, explored {{the basis for the}} observed immunity to this process of a diverged tandem duplication that probably arose by a natural duplication followed by RIP (the Neurospora &-η region), and investigated whether RIP extends at all into unique sequences bordering a duplicated region. Bacterial sequences of the plasmid pUC 8 and of a gene conferring resistance to hygromycin B were sensitive to RIP in N. crassa when repeated in the genome. When the entire 1. 6 -kb &-η region was duplicated, it was susceptible to RIP, but was affected by it to a lesser extent than other duplications. Only three of 62 progeny from crosses harboring unlinked duplications of the region showed evidence of changes. We attribute the low level of alterations to depletion of <b>mutable</b> <b>sites.</b> The stability of the of the &-η region in strains having single copies of the region suggests that the 14 % divergence of the tandem elements is sufficient to prevent RIP. DNA sequence analysis of unduplicated pUC 8 sequences adjacent to a duplication revealed that RIP continued at least 180 bp beyond the boundary of the duplication. Three mutations occurred in the 200 -bp segment of bordering sequences examined...|$|R
40|$|The genome of the food-borne {{pathogen}} Campylobacter jejuni contains multiple highly <b>mutable</b> <b>sites,</b> or contingency loci. It {{has been}} suggested that standing variation at these loci is a mechanism for rapid adaptation to a novel environment, but this phenomenon has not been shown experimentally. In previous work we showed that the virulence of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 increased after serial passage through a C 57 BL/ 6 IL- 10 (-/-) mouse model of campylobacteriosis. Here we sought to determine the genetic basis of this adaptation during passage. Re-sequencing of the 1. 64 Mb genome to 200 - 500 X coverage allowed us to define variation in 23 contingency loci to an unprecedented depth both before and after in vivo adaptation. Mutations in the mouse-adapted C. jejuni were largely restricted to the homopolymeric tracts of thirteen contingency loci. These changes cause significant alterations in open reading frames of genes in surface structure biosynthesis loci and in genes with only putative functions. Several loci with open reading frame changes also had altered transcript abundance. The increase in specific phases of contingency loci during in vivo passage of C. jejuni, coupled with the observed virulence increase and the lack of other types of genetic changes, is the first experimental evidence that these variable regions {{play a significant role in}} C. jejuni adaptation and virulence in a novel host...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a screening approach that utilizes an inverse {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) to detect P element insertions in or near previously cloned genes in Drosophila melanogaster. We used this approach {{in a large scale}} genetic screen in which P elements were mobilized from sites on the X chromosome to new autosomal locations. Mutagenized flies were combined in pools, and our screening approach was used to generate probes corresponding to the sequences flanking each site of insertion. These probes then were used for hybridization to cloned genomic intervals, allowing individuals carrying insertions in them to be detected. We used the same approach to perform repeated rounds of sib-selection to generate stable insertion lines. We screened 16, 100 insert bearing individuals and recovered 11 insertions in five intervals containing genes encoding members of the kinesin superfamily in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, we recovered an insertion in the region including the Larval Serum Protein- 2 gene. Examination by Southern hybridization confirms that the lines we recovered represent genuine insertions in the corresponding genomic intervals. Our data indicates that this approach will be very efficient both for P element mutagenesis of new genomic regions and for detection and recovery of ``local'' P element transposition events. In addition, our data constitutes a survey of preferred P element insertion sites in the Drosophila genome and suggests that insertion <b>sites</b> that are <b>mutable</b> at a rate of ~ 10 (- 4) are distributed every 40 - 50 kb...|$|R
5000|$|The bead {{theory is}} a disproved {{hypothesis}} that genes are arranged on the chromosome like beads on a necklace. According to this theory, {{the existence of}} a gene as a unit of inheritance is recognized through its mutant alleles. A mutant allele affects a single phenotypic character, maps to one chromosome locus, gives a mutant phenotype when paired and shows a Mendelian ratio when intercrossed. Several tenets of the bead theory are worth emphasizing :-1. The gene is viewed as a fundamental unit of structure, indivisible by crossing over. Crossing over take place between genes ( [...] the beads in this model [...] ) but never within them.2. The gene is viewed as the fundamental unit of change or mutation. It changes in toto from one allelic form into another; there are no smaller components within it that can change.3. The gene is viewed as the fundamental unit of function ( [...] although the precise function of gene is not specified in this model [...] ). Parts of a gene, if they exist cannot function.Seymour Benzer showed in the 1950s that the bead theory was not correct. He demonstrated that a gene can be defined as a unit of function. A gene can be subdivided into a linear array of <b>sites</b> that are <b>mutable</b> and that can be recombined. The smallest units of mutation and recombination are now known to be correlated with single nucleotide pairs.|$|R
40|$|Heteroplasmy, the {{existence}} of multiple mtDNA types within an individual, has been previously detected by using mostly indirect methods and focusing largely on just the hypervariable segments of the control region. Next-generation sequencing technologies should enable studies of heteroplasmy across the entire mtDNA genome at much higher resolution, because many independent reads are generated for each position. However, the higher error rate associated with these technologies {{must be taken into}} consideration to avoid false detection of heteroplasmy. We used simulations and phiX 174 sequence data to design criteria for accurate detection of heteroplasmy with the Illumina Genome Analyzer platform, and we used artificial mixtures and replicate data to test and refine the criteria. We then applied these criteria to mtDNA sequence reads for 131 individuals from five Eurasian populations that had been generated via a parallel tagged approach. We identified 37 heteroplasmies at 10 % frequency or higher at 34 sites in 32 individuals. The mutational spectrum does not differ between heteroplasmic mutations and polymorphisms in the same individuals, but the relative mutation rate at heteroplasmic mutations is significantly higher than that estimated for all <b>mutable</b> <b>sites</b> in the human mtDNA genome. Moreover, there is also a significant excess of nonsynonymous mutations observed among heteroplasmies, compared to polymorphism data from the same individuals. Both mutation-drift and negative selection influence the fate of heteroplasmies to determine the polymorphism spectrum in humans. With appropriate criteria for avoiding false positives due to sequencing errors, next-generation technologies can provide novel insights into genome-wide aspects of mtDNA heteroplasmy...|$|R
40|$|To {{gain more}} {{detailed}} {{insight into the}} nature and mechanisms of spontaneous mutations, we undertook a DNA sequence analysis of a large collection of spontaneous mutations in the N-terminal region of the Escherichia coli lacI gene. This region of circa 210 base pairs is the target for dominant lacI mutations (i(-d)) and is suitable for studies of mutational specificity since it contains a relatively high density of detectable <b>mutable</b> <b>sites.</b> Among 414 independent i(-d) mutants, 70. 8 % were base substitutions, 17. 2 % deletions, 7. 7 % additions and 4. 3 % single-base frameshifts. The base substitutions were both transitions (60 %) and transversions (40 %), the largest single group being G. C->A. T (47 % of base substitutions). All four transversions were observed. Among the 71 deletions, a hotspot (37 mutants) was present: an 87 -bp deletion presumably directed by an 8 -bp repeated sequence at its endpoints. The remaining 34 deletions were distributed among 29 different mutations, either flanked (13 / 34) or not flanked (21 / 34) by repeated sequences. The 32 additions comprised 29 different events, with only two containing a direct repeat at the endpoints. The single-base frameshifts were {{the loss of a}} single base from either repeated (67 %) or nonrepeated (33 %) bases. A comparison with the spectrum obtained previously in strains defective in DNA mismatch correction (mutH, mutL, mutS strains) yielded information about the apparent efficiency of mismatch repair. The overall effect was 260 -fold but varied substantially among different classes of mutations. An interesting asymmetry was uncovered for the two types of transitions, A. T->G. C and G. C->A. T being reduced by mismatch repair 1340 - and 190 -fold, respectively. Explanations for this asymmetry and its possible implications for the origins of spontaneous mutations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{mutations}} in the mtDNA control region (CR) using deep-rooting French-Canadian pedigrees. In 508 maternal transmissions, we observed four substitutions (0. 0079 per generation per 673 bp, 95 % CI 0. 0023 – 0. 186). Combined with other familial studies, our results {{add up to}} 18 substitutions in 1, 729 transmissions (0. 0104), confirming earlier findings of much greater mutation rates in families than those based on phylogenetic comparisons. Only 12 of these mutations occurred at independent sites, whereas three positions mutated twice each, suggesting that pedigree studies preferentially reveal a fraction of highly <b>mutable</b> <b>sites.</b> Fitting the data through use of a nonuniform rate model predicts the presence of 40 (95 % CI 27 – 54) such fast sites in the whole CR, characterized by the mutation rate of 274 per site per million generations (95 % CI 138 – 410). The corresponding values for hypervariable regions I (HVI; 1, 729 transmissions) and II (HVII; 1, 956 transmissions), are 19 and 22 fast sites, with rates of 224 and 274, respectively. Because of the high probability of recurrent mutations, such sites {{are expected to be}} of no or little informativity for the evaluation of mutational distances at the phylogenetic time scale. The analysis of substitution density in the alignment of 973 HVI and 650 HVII unrelated European sequences reveals that the bulk of the sites mutate at relatively moderate and slow rates. Assuming a star-like phylogeny and an average time depth of 250 generations, we estimate the rates for HVI and HVII at 23 and 24 for the moderate sites and 1. 3 and 1. 0 for the slow sites. The fast, moderate, and slow sites, at the ratio of 1 : 2 : 13, respectively, describe the mutation-rate heterogeneity in the CR. Our results reconcile the controversial rate estimates in the phylogenetic and familial studies; the fast sites prevail in the latter, whereas the slow and moderate sites dominate the phylogenetic-rate estimations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Alternative {{splicing}} (AS) of maturing mRNA {{can generate}} structurally and functionally distinct transcripts {{from the same}} gene. Recent bioinformatic analyses of available genome databases inferred {{a positive correlation between}} intron length and AS. To study the interplay between intron length and AS empirically and in more detail, we analyzed the diversity of alternatively spliced transcripts (ASTs) in the Drosophila RNA-binding Bruno- 3 (Bru- 3) gene. This gene was known to encode thirteen exons separated by introns of diverse sizes, ranging from 71 to 41, 973 nucleotides in D. melanogaster. Although Bru- 3 's structure is expected to be conducive to AS, only two ASTs of this gene were previously described. Results: Cloning of RT-PCR products of the entire ORF from four species representing three diverged Drosophila lineages provided an evolutionary perspective, high sensitivity, and long-range contiguity of splice choices currently unattainable by high-throughput methods. Consequently, we identified three new exons, a new exon fragment and thirty-three previously unknown ASTs of Bru- 3. All exon-skipping events in the gene were mapped to the exons surrounded by introns of at least 800 nucleotides, whereas exons split by introns of less than 250 nucleotides were always spliced contiguously in mRNA. Cases of exon loss and creation during Bru- 3 evolution in Drosophila were also localized within large introns. Notably, we identified a true de novo exon gain: exon 8 was created along the lineage of the obscura group from intronic sequence between cryptic splice sites conserved among all Drosophila species surveyed. Exon 8 was included in mature mRNA by the species representing all the major branches of the obscura group. To our knowledge, the origin of exon 8 is the first documented case of exonization of intronic sequence outside vertebrates. Conclusion: We found that large introns can promote AS via exon-skipping and exon turnover during evolution likely due to frequent errors in their removal from maturing mRNA. Large introns could be a reservoir of genetic diversity, because they have a greater number of <b>mutable</b> <b>sites</b> than short introns. Taken together, gene structure can constrain and/or promote gene evolution. ...|$|R
40|$|This practice-based {{research}} {{is drawn from}} the broader field of the Dramatic Arts and lies within the specific discipline of theatre design. The principle aim is to investigate and analyse the methodology of freehand drawing as the unique means of imaging the dramatic text for theatre and to contextualise my own practice within a theoretical framework. It {{is driven by the}} argument that the thinking drawings, more so than the finished, built design, exist as the primary site of revelation for the Australian theatre designer. This {{research is}} underpinned by the formal methodologies of Stephen Scrivener, Donald Schön and Douglas Hofstadter; my unconscious practice emerges organically through the unstructured reflective process of Peggy Phelans performative writing. The hypothesis driven model has been replaced with the equally rigorous model of reflective practice, by which the unending transformative spiral of research has spawned multiple avenues for future research examining drawing from the dramatic text. One such avenue is the discovery of the unrecognised secret autonomous drawing (a drawing that exists outside the original theatre production process). It is this drawing, in particular, that is potentially a door or portal, deep in the consciousness of the theatre designer. The ghosts inhabiting the dark space of the empty stage are illuminated in the designers eye of the mind where the spectral presence embedded in the palimpsest of the autonomous drawing becomes the seminal source of revelation, of originality and innovation. Integral to this practice-based research was an exhibition, held at the COFA Space, of a personal body of dramatic drawings that accompanied the text. The explorations documented in the text were tested for their potential to become a primary outcome, such as an exhibition of works before a different type of audience in a different style of venue from that of a theatrical production. This exhibition complemented the written dissertation with a critical and reflective focus on the creative or practice component. The principle focus of this exhibition was an interrogation of the process of creating new spaces in the dramatic drawing - the transformation of the dramatic text into the performative scenographic script and in so doing open up new possibilities and artistic and design potential.  In the Twenty-First Century the drawings of the contemporary Australian theatre designer are an exclusive personal insight into the intricate nuances of the imaging of the dramatic text and are exceptional in their ability to illuminate a space in constant flux, a <b>site</b> of infinite <b>mutable</b> signs, which excite cognitive surprise, wonder and astonishment. Importantly, they are also the only door into the theatre designers uncensored private thoughts in an innately collaborative art form...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Functionally {{relevant}} artificial {{or natural}} mutations {{are difficult to}} assess or predict if no structure-function information is available for a protein. This is especially important to correctly identify functionally significant non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) or to design a site-directed mutagenesis strategy for a target protein. A new and powerful methodology is proposed to guide these two decision strategies, based only on conservation rules of physicochemical properties of amino acids extracted from a multiple alignment of a protein family where the target protein belongs, with no need of explicit structure-function relationships. Results A statistical analysis is performed over each amino acid position in the multiple protein alignment, based on different amino acid physical or chemical characteristics, including hydrophobicity, side-chain volume, charge and protein conformational parameters. The variances {{of each of these}} properties at each position are combined to obtain a global statistical indicator of the conservation degree of each property. Different types of physicochemical conservation are defined to characterize relevant and irrelevant positions. The differences between statistical variances are taken together as the basis of hypothesis tests at each position to search for functionally significant <b>mutable</b> <b>sites</b> and to identify specific mutagenesis targets. The outcome is used to statistically predict physicochemical consensus sequences based on different properties and to calculate the amino acid propensities at each position in a given protein. Hence, amino acid positions are identified that are putatively responsible for function, specificity, stability or binding interactions in a family of proteins. Once these key functional positions are identified, position-specific statistical distributions are applied to divide the 20 common protein amino acids in each position of the protein's primary sequence into a group of functionally non-disruptive amino acids and a second group of functionally deleterious amino acids. Conclusions With this approach, not only conserved amino acid positions in a protein family can be labeled as functionally relevant, but also non-conserved amino acid positions can be identified to have a physicochemically meaningful functional effect. These results become a discriminative tool in the selection and elaboration of rational mutagenesis strategies for the protein. They {{can also be used to}} predict if a given nsSNP, identified, for instance, in a genomic-scale analysis, can have a functional implication for a particular protein and which nsSNPs are most likely to be functionally silent for a protein. This analytical tool could be used to rapidly and automatically discard any irrelevant nsSNP and guide the research focus toward functionally significant mutations. Based on preliminary results and applications, this technique shows promising performance as a valuable bioinformatics tool to aid in the development of new protein variants and in the understanding of function-structure relationships in proteins. </p...|$|R
