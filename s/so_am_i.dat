500|$|In September 2010, William Shatner {{commented on}} Twitter {{regarding}} {{damage to his}} star on the Walk of Fame: [...] "I hear my star on the Canadian Walk of Fame is a bit frazzled ... but, then again, <b>so</b> <b>am</b> <b>I.</b> I wonder if anybody hovering around that area can tell me what’s wrong with it and what needs fixing." [...] The family of Gordie Howe also commented on the damage to Gordie's star. The Canadian Press reported that [...] "A number of celebrities' stars are looking a bit rough around the edges." [...] The president of the Walk of Fame stated that damage {{was due to the}} freezing and thawing during Canadian winters and also sidewalk snowplows. It was announced that the city of Toronto would replace Shatner and Howe's damaged tiles, and the Walk of Fame was looking into an alternative to installing the plaques on a sidewalk where they are subjected to harsh environmental conditions.|$|E
500|$|Seeing Green's revealingly autobiographical Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary while in-progress in 1971 {{inspired}} Spiegelman {{to produce}} [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet", an expressionistic work {{that dealt with}} his mother's suicide; it appeared in 1972 in Short Order Comix 1, which he edited. [...] Spiegelman's work thereafter went through a phase of increasing formal experimentation; the Apex Treasury of Underground Comics in 1974 quotes him: [...] "As an art form the comic strip is barely in its infancy. [...] <b>So</b> <b>am</b> <b>I.</b> [...] Maybe we'll grow up together." [...] The often-reprinted [...] "Ace Hole, Midget Detective" [...] of 1974 was a Cubist-style nonlinear parody of hardboiled crime fiction full of non sequiturs. [...] "A Day at the Circuits" [...] of 1975 is a recursive single-page strip about alcoholism and depression in which the reader follows the character through multiple never-ending pathways. [...] "Nervous Rex: The Malpractice Suite" [...] of 1976 {{is made up of}} cut-out panels from the soap-opera comic strip Rex Morgan, M.D. refashioned {{in such a way as}} to defy coherence.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 February 2009 the Norwegian {{socialist party}} Red began a global {{campaign}} {{in support of}} The Pirate Bay and filesharers worldwide that lasted until 1 May.

2500|$|Lighthouse {{design was}} the family's profession: Thomas's father (Robert's grandfather) was the famous civil {{engineer}} Robert Stevenson, {{and both of}} Thomas's brothers (Robert's uncles) Alan and David, {{were in the same}} field. Indeed, even Thomas's maternal grandfather, Thomas Smith, had been in the same profession. However, Robert's mother's family were not of the same profession. Margaret's natal family, the Balfours, were gentry, tracing their lineage back to a certain Alexander Balfour who had held the lands of Inchyra in Fife in the fifteenth century. Margaret's father, Lewis Balfour (1777–1860), was a minister of the Church of Scotland at nearby Colinton, and her siblings included the physician George William Balfour and the marine engineer James Balfour. Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfather's house. [...] "Now I often wonder," [...] wrote Stevenson, [...] "what I inherited from this old minister. I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and <b>so</b> <b>am</b> <b>I,</b> though I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Use against Clinton of the [...] "bitch" [...] epithet flourished {{during the}} campaign, {{especially}} on the Internet but via conventional media as well. [...] Hundreds of YouTube videos carried the word, with such titles as [...] "Hillary Clinton: The Bitch is Back" [...] and [...] "Hillary Clinton: Crazy Bitch", and a Facebook groups with the theme proliferated, including one named [...] "Life's a Bitch, Why Vote for One?" [...] that had more than 1,500 members. [...] Broadcaster Glenn Beck used the term in describing her. In a November 2007 public appearance, John McCain was asked {{by one of his}} supporters, [...] "How do we beat the bitch?" [...] (McCain responded by saying, [...] "May I give the translation?" [...] and then went on to say he respected Clinton but could defeat her.) [...] A February 2008 Saturday Night Live monologue by Tina Fey led a backlash-through-embracing movement, when she said [...] "I think what bothers me the most is when people say that Hillary is a bitch. Let me say something about that. Yeah, she is. And <b>so</b> <b>am</b> <b>I....</b> You know what? Bitches get stuff done.... Get on board. Bitch is the new black!" [...] A new Facebook group [...] "Bitch is the new Black" [...] gained three times the membership of all the anti-Clinton groups named after the word.|$|E
