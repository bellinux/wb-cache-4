A musical instrument synthesizer synthesizes the sound of specific instruments from generichardware.

50|$|A similar term {{commonly}} used in test and measurement, Virtual instrumentation, is a superset of synthetic instrumentation. All <b>synthetic</b> <b>instruments</b> are virtual instruments; however, the two terms are different when virtual instrument software mirrors and augments non-generic instrument hardware, providing a soft front panel, or managing the data flow to and from a natural instrument.

Hardware supporting <b>synthetic</b> <b>instruments</b> is by definition not specific to the measurement, nor is it necessarily (or usually) modular.|$|E

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado al XIII Simposio de Investigadores Jóvenes de la Real Sociedad Española de Química Sigma-Aldrich, celebrado en Logroño del 8 al 11 de noviembre de 2016. During {{the last}} years bisubstrate inhibitors are playing a growing role in drug design, finding an intense {{application}} in enzymes such as glycosyltransferases. Recently this approach was used to build selective ligands targeting the OGlcNAc transferase (OGT) in which the donor (uridine based), and the acceptor (peptide based) moieties, are covalently linked in a single substrate. However; the synthesis of these ligands usually involves low yield and difficult synthetic pathways. Herein we present an efficient protocol for the synthesis of useful N-Fmoc-protected, uridine-based amino acids; that can be directly employed as building blocks in solid-phase peptide synthesis. Furthermore, these amino acids were functionalized with different linker between the uridine and the amino acidic fragment giving the possibility to play with neutral or coordinating uridine-peptide bridges, making of them a versatile <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> to build new inhibitors targeting OGT and more uridinebased glycosyltransferases.

50|$|At the {{software}} level, portability of measurement description {{is the key}} attribute that distinguishes a <b>synthetic</b> <b>instrument</b> from the more commonly found instrumentation software—software that is limited to hardware scripting and data flow processing. Not all measurement related software systems inherently provide for the abstract, portable synthesis of measurements. Even if they do have such provisions, they may not typically be applied that way by users, especially if the system encourages non-abstracted access to hardware. Application software packages such as Measure Foundry and LabVIEW are typically used with explicit structural links to the natural measurements made by specific hardware and therefore usually are not synthesizing measurements from an abstract description. On the other hand, should a software system be used to synthesize measurement functions as descriptive behavioral constructs, rather than hardware referenced structural data flow descriptions, this is true measurement synthesis. An analogy here is the distinction between a non portable structuraldescription and an abstract behavioral description of digital logic {{that we see in}} HDL systems like Verilog.|$|R
