50|$|Sausages come in {{two main}} types: fresh and <b>cured.</b> <b>Cured</b> <b>sausages</b> may be either cooked or dried.

50|$|The name braadworst means roast sausage in Dutch, whereas verse worst {{simply means}} fresh sausage (as opposed to dried or <b>cured</b> <b>sausages).</b>|$|R
50|$|Droëwors {{is unusual}} among dried meats in being dried quickly in warm, dry conditions, unlike {{traditional}} droge worstItalian cured salumi, which are dried slowly in relatively cold and humid conditions. A further {{difference is that}} droëwors does not contain curing agent as found in a traditional <b>cured</b> <b>sausage.</b> A direct result {{of this is that}} droëwors should not be kept in moist conditions as mold can begin to form more easily than would happen with a <b>cured</b> <b>sausage.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Spain, fresh sausages, salchichas, {{which are}} eaten cooked, and <b>cured</b> <b>sausages,</b> embutidos, which are eaten uncooked, are two {{distinct}} categories. Among the <b>cured</b> <b>sausages</b> are found products like chorizo, salchichón, and sobrasada. Blood sausage, morcilla, {{is found in}} both cured and fresh varieties. They are made with pork meat and blood, usually adding rice, garlic, paprika and other spices. There are many regional variations, and in general they are either fried or cooked in cocidos.|$|R

40|$|The risk of {{listeriosis}} {{associated with}} ready-to-eat foods {{is a major}} concern in United States. The recently published United States regulations require ready-to-eat meat producers to control Listeria monocytogenes, using interventions which may include antimicrobials that reduce post-processing contamination by at least 1 log cycle and that no more than 1 log increase throughout product shelf life. This regulation impact also the Spanish meat producers especially dry <b>cured</b> <b>sausages,</b> which export their products to USA. In this study, we analyzed in vitro, individually and in combinations, the commonly applied antimicrobials to reduce Listeria.

50|$|<b>Cured</b> <b>{{sausages}}</b> {{differ from}} fresh sausages by including 2 teaspoons of cure (Prague powder #1) per 10 pounds of finished product. This is usually interpreted per 10 pounds of meat. This {{works out to}} 4 ounces of cure for 100 pounds of sausage.|$|R

50|$|Salami {{is a type}} of <b>cured</b> <b>sausage</b> {{consisting}} of fermented and air-dried meat, typically beef or pork.

For this reason it is recommended for meats that require long (weeks to months) cures, like hard salami and country ham.|$|R

40|$|The present work {{studied the}} {{characteristics}} of "Paio do Alentejo", a traditional Iberian dry <b>cured</b> <b>sausage,</b> produced in Alentejo region, in two selected industrial plants, that use different methods; one of them used smoking {{and the other one}} did not use it. Both factories did not use starter cultures. In this research work the evolution of that product during its storage at 25. °C, vacuum and modified atmosphere packaged was studied. Changes on the main physicochemical parameters (pH, aw, chlorides, TVBN, Titratable acidity, L*, a*, b*), microbiological counts (mesophilic aerobic bacteria, psycho-tropic, moulds, yeasts, Lactobacillus spp., lactic acid bacteria, Micrococcaceae,Enterobacteriaceae, and Enterococci) and sensory evaluation (colour intensity, off colour, aroma intensity, off aroma, taste intensity, off taste, salt content and global evaluation) were studied in the final product and also at 3, 6 and 9 months of storage. A multifactor ANOVA/MANOVA was made, considering "factory", "storage package" and "storage time" factors and their interaction. This research work evidences the importance of smoking in order to maintain physicochemical, microbiological and sensory characteristics of a high quality dry <b>cured</b> <b>sausage</b> from the Alentejano pig breed, using vacuum packaging and modified atmosphere packaging, at 25 ° C, without energy consumption, during 9 month, at least...|$|R

In modern food chemistry, the sakacins have been studied for their use against Listeria {{in the production of}} sausages (like Portuguese lingüiça) and cured meat products (such as ham and cold cuts), cheeses, and other lactic acid fermented products. They are also used to repress unwanted bacterial growth that might cause ropiness, sliminess, malodor and other product defects.|$|R
