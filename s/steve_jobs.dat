40|$|Corporate {{citizenship}} is a debatable topic, {{according to many}} authors corporate {{citizenship is}} equivalent to corporate governance, corporate social responsibility and business ethics. Therefore, we have explained all the four theories in order to equip our reader with the subject in concern. This topic is of growing concern taking the evolutions of the subject, the previous and ongoing scandals into consideration.    The paper will present {{an overview of the}} concept of Corporate Citizenship and its alliances and provides the readers with different definitions of the above mentioned concept. We explained the relation between Corporate Citizenship (CC) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). We shall use both the terms CC and CRS interchangeably. After going through the literature we felt that there was not enough written about the leader’s role with regards to the ideology of Corporate Citizenship. Therefore, we took the opportunity and used these concepts to screen <b>Steve</b> <b>Job</b> the CEO of apple against the norms of corporate citizenship. Our choice of topic was also motivated by Fortune Magazine 2008 - 2009 edition.    We used Explorative study to fill our research gap by framing very general and broad research questions. A qualitative study was conducted with fifty (50) people from Umeå – Sweden.   Our interviewees were mostly students from university and one interview was conducted from the IT head of a public organization from Umeå Sweden.    Defying the theoretical concepts we used, we concluded that the consumers we interviewed embrace highly about the concepts of Corporate Citizenship but in practice, they did not bother to take these concepts into consideration before buying the produc...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] In today’s global marketplace, {{organizations}} {{no longer}} operate with linear supply chains or manufacturing models. The issue of global labor standards {{has been a}} debated topic since the 1990 ’s and industry supply chains continue to provoke discussions around labor standards and improving worker conditions[i]. Nike presents the classic example of an organization that exploited its outsourcing model and was ultimately forced to take accountability for its actions in the 1990 ’s. Today’s millennial generation alongside consumer groups is now addressing <b>Steve</b> <b>Job’s</b> legacy, Apple and its primary supplier, Foxconn. On June 14 th 2012, a Foxconn employee jumped to his death from his apartment building; marking the 18 th reported worker suicide at Foxconn factories in China in just over two years[ii]. Many additional suicides may have gone unreported. But these deaths and the focus on conditions at Foxconn reflect {{only a portion of}} the troubling conditions at Apple suppliers that includes issues around organizational work design and employee working conditions. As consumer confidence in the ability of corporations to be socially responsible deteriorates {{it is up to the}} HR function to play a strategic role in navigating and providing strategic solutions to maintaining fair global labor standards within an organization. In this paper, I will discuss the role of HR to be more involved as a line leader that looks to integrate global labor standards compliance as an essential element in an organizations business model. I will also discuss the need for HR to push for the centrality of compliance in organizations along with the necessary layers of oversight while creating an organizational culture that fosters and encourages socially responsible behavior of subcontractors and suppliers...|$|R
40|$|This action {{research}} study aimed {{to observe and}} to describe the processes, the changes, {{and the results of}} the implementation of pre-communicative and communicative activities to improve students’ speaking skill of the students of class X IS II of SMAN 1 Godean. The {{action research}} model employed Kemmis and McTaggar’s. It consisted of four steps which were reconnaissance, plan, action and observation, and reflection. The research subjects were the 31 students of Class X IS II in SMA N 1 Godean in the 2015 / 2016 academic year in the second semester. They consisted of 25 female students and 6 male students. It consisted of two cycles with each consisting of three meetings within six-weeks long. This action research study used mixed-method research with both qualitative and quantitative data. The qualitative data were collected through observations, interviews, and open ended questions. The analysis of the qualitative data employed the Miles’ and Huberman’s (2014) Interactive Model which consisted of three steps, namely data condensation, data display, and conclusion drawing. The quantitative data were in the form of speaking performance scores gained through the speaking performance pre-test and post test. The analysis of the data was done through the mean scores comparison. The result of the research showed that the students indicated improvement in their speaking skills, particularly in terms of fluency, pronunciation and intonation, and interactive skills. The achievement was gained through the use of pre-communicative and communicative activities and the eight complementary actions. The pre-communicative activitieswere in the form of vocabulary exercises, pronunciation and intonation drilling, homework, and semi-guided speaking activity. The communicative activities were the Holiday Survey, Sharing Embarrassing Experience of Childhood, <b>Steve</b> <b>Job’s</b> Life Timeline, and the Best Admirer.
