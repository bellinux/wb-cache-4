50|$|<b>Self-aligning</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> {{such as the}} Wingquist bearing {{shown in}} the picture, are {{constructed}} with the inner ring and ball assembly contained within an outer ring that has a spherical raceway. This construction allows the bearing to tolerate a small angular misalignment resulting from shaft or housing deflections or improper mounting. The bearing was used mainly in bearing arrangements with very long shafts, such as transmission shafts in textile factories.One drawback of the <b>self-aligning</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> is a limited load rating, as the outer raceway has very low osculation (radius is much larger than ball radius). This led to {{the invention of the}} spherical roller bearing, which has a similar design, but use rollers instead of balls. Also the spherical roller thrust bearing is an invention that derives from the findings by Wingquist.|$|R
50|$|Cannon box {{bearings}} {{are still}} found today, {{although much of}} the need for them was removed by the development of <b>self-aligning</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> These allow the inner race of a bearing to move independently of its outer, so that each bearing can align to both shaft and housing simultaneously, even if the housing moves around.|$|R
50|$|The bells at the Abbey were {{overhauled}} in 1962. The ring is {{now made}} up of twelve bells, hung for change ringing, cast in 1962, by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough. The inscriptions of the old 5th and 10th bells are copied in facsimile onto the new bells. The bells have modern cast iron headstocks and all run on <b>self-aligning</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> They are hung in the north-east corner of the tower, and the ringing chamber is partitioned {{off from the rest}} of the tower.

Sven Wingqvist invented the multi-row <b>self-aligning</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> in 1907.|$|E
50|$|Orders for the {{subsequent}} Class 5E1, Series 3 and later models made provision for roller suspension bearings incorporating a lip-type {{cylindrical roller bearing}} to replace the <b>self-aligning</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> at the pinion end, and alternatively for tapered roller bearings at both ends. Since the external dimensions of the bearing housings would remain the same, the traction motors would still be freely interchangeable.|$|E

50|$|On 16 February 1907 on Sven Wingqvist's {{applied for}} Swedish patent No. 25406, a multi-row <b>self-aligning</b> radial <b>ball</b> <b>bearing.</b> The Patent was granted on 6 June in Sweden coinciding with patents in 10 other countries. The new <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> was {{successful}} from the outset. Three years after SKF was founded, {{the company had}} 325 employees and a subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Manufacturing operations were later established in multiple countries.|$|R
50|$|In 1883, Friedrich Fischer, {{founder of}} FAG, {{developed}} an approach for milling and grinding balls of equal size and exact roundness {{by means of}} a suitable production machine and formed the foundation for creation of an independent bearing industry.The modern, <b>self-aligning</b> design of <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> is attributed to Sven Wingquist of the SKF ball-bearing manufacturer in 1907, when he was awarded Swedish patent No. 25406 on its design.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrangement}} {{consisted of}} a <b>self-aligning</b> spherical roller (<b>ball)</b> <b>bearing</b> at the pinion end and a parallel roller bearing at the commutator end of the traction motor. The bearings were grease-lubricated and were carried in a split cannon box to which the traction motor was attached by means of two clamps which engaged cylindrically-machined seatings {{on the outside of}} the housing. The roller-type suspension bearings required little attention other than the replenishment of the grease when the wheels were removed for tyre-turning.|$|R
50|$|Like the Series 2, the {{traction}} motors of the Series 3 were also equipped with roller-type suspension bearings.

50|$|Sven Wingqvist, at {{the time}} a thirty-year-old plant {{engineer}} responsible for repairs and maintenance at Gamlestadens Fabriker, was dissatisfied with the performance of the ball bearings then in use. These were rigid ball bearings, imported from Germany, and if the long shafts on the machinery in a textile mill were the least bit misaligned, the ball bearings would become overheated and break down, bringing production to a costly halt. In spring 1907, Wingquist presented a breakthrough - a double row <b>self-aligning</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> with a spherical raceway in the outer ring, shared by both rows of balls. This allowed the inner ring to align freely in relation to the outer ring, with no negative impact on the function of the bearing. The new bearing solved the problem associated with misalignment of the shafts and thus did away with the frequent production stops. Self-alignment was particularly useful in the less-than-perfect machinery of the times and in buildings with subsidence problems, which was the case at Gamlestadens Fabriker, since much of the land on which Gothenburg has been built is clay.|$|E
5000|$|... 1907: On the {{initiative}} of Sven Wingqvist and the owners of Gamlestadens Textile Industry, SKF was founded February 16, at first as a subsidiary company to Gamlestadens Textile Industry. He was appointed the managing director as well as technical manager. Axel Carlander, son {{of one of the}} owners of Gamlestadens Textile Industry, was appointed CEO for SKF. (Axel Carlander held the position as CEO for SKF until 1937). May 21: SKF filed the patent application at the Swedish Patent and Registration Office (PRV) for a Multi-row <b>self-aligning</b> radial <b>ball</b> <b>bearing.</b> Patent is granted June 6 with patent reg. No. 25406. Inventor: S.G. Wingqvist. In the patent application a double-row as well as a triple-row <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> is described. Within the same period of time, patent applications is sent out by SKF to 10 different countries, among them France, Germany, England and the United States and patent is granted in all countries within a short time. The door was now open for the worldwide expansion. After the new factory had been built in Göteborg, SKF sales companies as well as new manufacturing plants were built up in a lot of countries around the world. The first SKF manufacturing plant outside Sweden was set up in Luton, England 1911.|$|R

5000|$|Also called [...] "ball slides," [...] <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> slides are {{the most}} common type of linear slide. <b>Ball</b> <b>bearing</b> slides offer smooth {{precision}} motion along a single-axis linear design, aided by <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> housed in the linear base, with self-lubrication properties that increase reliability. <b>Ball</b> <b>bearing</b> slide applications include delicate instrumentation, robotic assembly, cabinetry, high-end appliances and clean room environments, which primarily serve the manufacturing industry but also the furniture, electronics and construction industries. For example, a widely used <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> slide in the furniture industry is a <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> drawer slide.|$|R
5000|$|... 1899: Employed as {{operating}} {{engineer at}} Gamlestadens Textile Industry in Göteborg {{where he worked}} many years {{to find a solution}} to the problems with frequent break downs in the ball bearings for the main drive shafts. This was caused by the ground conditions with lots of clay that the factory was built on and the shaft bearing supports moved some fractions of millimeters from time to time, hardly measurable, inducing enormous extra forces in the [...] "stiff" [...] bearings that was available at that time. Wingqvist spent more and more time on the development of bearings in general, collecting all sorts of technical achievements and new ideas that was presented continuously on the ball bearing concepts around Europe. In particular he carefully studied the report presented in 1902 by professor Richard Stribeck working at the Institute of Technology in Dresden, Germany, where he had compared ball bearings versus plain bearings from a scientific point of view. Wingqvist soon realized that the ball bearing techniques had a future and that there was room for innovations. On his initiative a small workshop was set up within the premises of Gamlestadens factory where they could carry out tests with different designs and steel materials. In 1906 he was granted a patent for a Single-row <b>self-aligning</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> (Swedish patent reg. No. 24160) but this type of bearing had the disadvantage that it could not stand very much axial loads. His work continued in order to find the solution for a self-aligning bearing that also could carry some axial loads.|$|E
50|$|The 1996 release {{represented}} an improvement for ACER Racing as their Ceramic Nitride Pro Series ceramic <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> were {{released to the}} public. They incorporated diamond polished silicon nitride balls inside the ceramic <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> used specific internal bearing tolerances, applied their SIN synthetic lightweight <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> oil to the ceramic balls in a proprietary process, engineered an HSR inner <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> cage and sealed the bearing with no contact dual seals. The HSR <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> cage tolerated much higher bearing RPMs with minimal friction and low heat and noise. It also allowed for precision ball alignment inside the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|R

50|$|Commonly {{constructed}} from {{materials such as}} aluminum, hardened cold rolled steel and galvanized steel, <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> slides consist of two linear rows of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> contained by four rods and located on differing sides of the base, which support the carriage for smooth linear movement along the <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> This low-friction linear movement can be powered by either a drive mechanism, inertia or by hand. <b>Ball</b> <b>bearing</b> slides {{tend to have a}} lower load capacity for their size compared to other linear slides because the balls are less resistant to wear and abrasions. In addition, <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> slides are limited by the need to fit into housing or drive systems.|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this report}} considers {{the life of the}} ball set as well as the respective lives of the races to reassess the effect of ball-race conformity on <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> life. The related changes in <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> life are incorporated in life factors {{that can be used to}} modify the bearing predicted life using the Lundberg-Palmgren equations and the ANSI/ABMA and ISO Standards. Two simple algebraic relationships were established to calculate life factors LF(sub c) to determine the effect of inner- and outer-race conformity combinations on bearing L(sub 10) life for deepgroove and angular-contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> respectively. Depending on the bearing type and series as well as conformity combinations, the calculated life for deep-groove <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> can be over 40 percent less than that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations. For angular-contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> the life can vary between + 16 and - 39 percent from that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations. Comparing the two <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> types, the life factors LF(sub c) for the deep-groove bearings can be as much as 40 percent lower than that for angular-contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{rotor system}} {{supported}} by an angular <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> displays very complicated non-linear behaviour due to non-linear Hertzian contact force. The non-linear force and moment {{caused by the}} <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> are calculated {{on the basis of}} the relationship between deflection, and five-degree-of-freedom dynamic equations of the rotor <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> system are established. The Newmark-β method and the Newton–Raphson method are used to solve the non-linear equations. The dynamic characteristics of angular <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> are computed, considering the non-linear vibration of the rotor system. Taking angular <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> QJS 208 ACQ 4 C 1 /HNP 4 as an example, the effects of the vibration of the rotor system on bearing dynamic characteristics are analysed. The results show that the spin-to-roll ratio of balls, the slide ratio of the cage, and stiffness of the bearing all vary obviously with the non-periodic vibration range of the rotor; initial contact angle and axial load of the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> change the non-linear dynamic nature of the rotor system and dynamic characteristics of the <b>bearing.</b> The rotor <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> system can work stably by choosing the structural and operation parameters reasonably...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>bearings</b> {{have been}} used to support {{rotating}} shafts in machines such as wind turbines, aircraft engines, and desktop computer fans. There has been extensive research in the areas of condition monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> As the identification of <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> defects by inspection interrupts the operation of rotating machines and can be costly, the assessment of the health of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> relies on the use of condition monitoring techniques. Fault detection and life prediction methods have been developed to improve condition-based maintenance and product qualification. However, intermittent and catastrophic system failures due to bearing problems still occur resulting in loss of life and increase of maintenance and warranty costs. Inaccurate life prediction of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> is of concern to industry. This research focuses on prognostics of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> based on vibration and acoustic emission analysis to provide early warning of failure and predict life in advance. The failure mechanisms of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> in cooling fans are identified and failure precursors associated with the defects are determined. A prognostic method based on Bayesian Monte Carlo method and sequential probability ratio test is developed to predict time-to-failure of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> in advance.
