40|$|This study reports {{application}} of monitoring and characterization protocol for particulate matter (PM) deposited on tree leaves, using Quercus ilex {{as a case}} study species. The study area is located in the industrial city of Terni in central Italy, with high PM concentrations. Four trees were selected as representative of distinct pollution environments based on their proximity to a steel factory and a <b>street.</b> <b>Wash</b> off from leaves onto cellulose filters were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, inferring the associations between particle sizes, chemical composition, and sampling location. Modeling of particle size distributions showed a tri-modal fingerprint, with the three modes centered at 0. 6 (factory related), 1. 2 (urban background), and 2. 6 ?m (traffic related). Chemical detection identified 23 elements abundant in the PM samples. Principal component analysis recognized iron and copper as source-specific PM markers, attributed mainly to industrial and heavy traffic pollution respectively. Upscaling these results on leaf area basis provided a useful indicator for strategic evaluation of harmful PM pollutants using tree leaves...|$|E
40|$|Several studies {{conducted}} in urban areas {{have pointed out that}} road dust resuspension contributes significantly to PM concentration levels. <b>Street</b> <b>washing</b> is one of the methods proposed to reduce resuspended road dust contributions to ambient PM concentrations. As resuspended particles are mainly found in the coarse mode, published studies investigating the effects of <b>street</b> <b>washing</b> have focused on PM 10 size fraction. As the PM 2. 5 mass fraction of particles originating from mechanical abrasion processes may still be significant we conducted a study in order to evaluate the effects of <b>street</b> <b>washing</b> on the mitigation of resuspension of fine particles. The PM 2. 5 mass concentration data were examined and integrated with the occurrence of <b>street</b> <b>washing</b> activities. In addition, the effect of the meteorological variability, traffic flow and <b>street</b> <b>washing</b> activities, on ambient PM 2. 5 levels was evaluated by means of a multivariate regression model. The results revealed that traffic flow is the most important factor that controls PM 2. 5 hourly concentrations while <b>street</b> <b>washing</b> activities did not influence fine particle mass levels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Although {{previous}} studies {{report on the}} effect of <b>street</b> <b>washing</b> on ambient particulate matter levels, {{there is a lack of}} studies investigating the results of <b>street</b> <b>washing</b> on the emission strength of road dust. A sampling campaign was conducted in Madrid urban area during July 2009 where road dust samples were collected in two sites, namely Reference site (where the road surface was not washed) and Pelayo site (where <b>street</b> <b>washing</b> was performed daily during night). Following the chemical characterization of the road dust particles the emission sources were resolved by means of Positive Matrix Factorization, PMF (Multilinear Engine scripting) and the mass contribution of each source was calculated for the two sites. Mineral dust, brake wear, tire wear, carbonaceous emissions and construction dust were the main sources of road dust with mineral and construction dust being the major contributors to inhalable road dust load. To evaluate the effectiveness of <b>street</b> <b>washing</b> on the emission sources, the sources mass contributions between the two sites were compared. Although brake wear and tire wear had lower concentrations at the site where <b>street</b> <b>washing</b> was performed, these mass differences were not statistically significant and the temporal variation did not show the expected build-up after dust removal. It was concluded that the washing activities resulted merely in a road dust moistening, without effective removal and that mobilization of particles took place in a few hours between washing and sampling. The results also indicated that it is worth paying attention to the dust dispersed from the construction sites as they affect the emission strength in nearby streets. ©Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research...|$|R

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the contribution of road dust to airborne particulate matter (PM 10) and evaluate the effects of <b>street</b> <b>washing</b> on the mitigation of resuspension. With this purpose an intensive campaign was carried out in a heavily trafficked central road of Madrid (Spain) including PM 10 sampling and chemical analysis. PM 10 daily levels during dry, unwashed conditions were 2 - 15 % higher than those present during the day after nightly <b>street</b> <b>washing.</b> However, this reduction is lower than the standard deviation of the PM 10 measurements. The diurnal variation of PM 10 revealed that a reduction in PM 10 was noticeable only during the morning hours. The emission sources for the urban area of Madrid were resolved by means of a receptor model, Positive Matrix Factorization, PMF. The results showed that the main sources were vehicle emissions, road dust, secondary aerosol including sulphate and nitrate, and soil. Vehicle emissions and road dust were the major contributor to PM 10 particle mass with similar average contributions of 31 % and 29 % respectively. The effect of <b>street</b> <b>washing</b> was also evaluated by examining the daily variation of the road dust source contribution between days with and without <b>street</b> <b>washing.</b> The mass contribution from the road dust source was ~ 2 μg m- 3 lower during the days that <b>street</b> <b>washing</b> was implemented with this corresponding to a reduction of 15 % of its mass contribution during the days that the road surface was left untreated. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Introduction: Aging is an {{inevitable}} {{process that has}} a social impact in the forecoming decades, and it will present a great challenge regarding public health. An efficient health system requires a reflection on the preventive measures to be implemented. Material and Methods: The study population comprised a total number of 2672 individuals of both genders, aged 55 years and over, residents in continental Portugal, to whom a questionnaire was applied that included the following sections: Social network; Locomotion; Physical autonomy; Instrumental autonomy; Cognitive assessment; Physical activity. Results: The study of aging in the Portuguese population found that physical autonomy for tasks related to daily life are associated with better cognitive evaluation. A statistically significant association was found between performance in cognitive assessment and gender, age, schooling, the fact of living alone, {{the number of hours}} being alone, autonomy to walk in the <b>street,</b> <b>washing,</b> dressing, eating, preparing meals, doing shopping, managing money and taking medications and washer / treat clothing. Discussion: Cognitive evaluation is negatively influenced by the number of hours that an individual is alone.

As social organization and technological capabilities grew, so did both the demand on and the abuse of water.
