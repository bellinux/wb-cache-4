5|$|In {{his last}} years Evans {{compiled}} a list, since lost, {{of all his}} inventions—eighty in total, as alluded to {{in the title of}} his last publication to his lawyers. Some of his unfinished ideas that are known include a scheme for the gas lighting of cities in the United States, a means for raising sunken ships, a machine gun, a self-oiling <b>shaft</b> <b>bearing,</b> various types of gearshift for steam carriages, a dough-kneading machine and a perpetual baking oven. In one proposal in 1814, as the British Navy threatened Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812, Evans ventured to build a steam-powered frigate, but the scheme didn't get far.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{is presented to}} predict the shifts of the contact ellipses of spiral bevel gear teeth under load. The contact ellipse shift is {{the motion of the}} tooth contact position from the ideal pitch point to its location under load. The shifts are due to the elastic motions of the gear and pinion supporting <b>shafts</b> and <b>bearings.</b> The calculations include the elastic deflections of the gear shafts and the deflections of the four <b>shaft</b> <b>bearings.</b> The method assumes that the surface curvature of each tooth is constant near the unloaded pitch point.

40|$|The reheat-stop-valve (RHSV) {{mechanism}} {{is a principal}} component in a steam turbine unit which controls the running state.

This paper proposes a method to quantitatively investigate {{the cumulative effect of}} dimensional tolerance, misalignment and thermal impact on the dynamic performance with <b>shaft</b> and <b>bearing</b> pairs in a RHSV mechanism. Finite element method is employed to study the effect of thermal impact on the clearance of the <b>shaft</b> and <b>bearing</b> pairs. Then, we calculate the clearance of the <b>shaft</b> and <b>bearing</b> pairs considering thermal impact and dimensional tolerance. Based on the non-linear clearance and misalignment, a model named compensation cone is developed to establish the multi-support mechanism of the <b>shaft</b> and <b>bearings</b> system. The method is demonstrated by applying to the RHSV mechanism in a supercritical steam turbine unit. The results indicate that the combined effect of dimensional tolerance, misalignment and thermal impact exerts great effect on the performance of mechanism...|$|R

This also eliminates any problem with breaker follower or cam wear, and by eliminating a side load it extends distributor <b>shaft</b> <b>bearing</b> life. The remaining secondary (high voltage) circuit stayed essentially the same, using an ignition coil and a rotary distributor.|$|E
