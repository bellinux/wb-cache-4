5|$|In her research, Fraser worked {{predominantly}} in infectious disease, studying general infection, puerperal fever, <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> and septic {{sore throat}} among other bacterial infections. She began studies on <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> {{in the early}} 1930s, and along with Dr. Helen Plummer isolated the precipitin present in the strains of streptococci {{likely to lead to}} disease. These findings were important in determining the types of antitoxins which might be employed for immunization to neutralize the disease. The type of research Fraser was engaged in required that the bacteria of the disease which created a toxin be isolated, so that it could be injected into a horse. Repeated injections of small doses of toxin allowed the horse to become immune to the disease. The serum created from the blood of animals which had been immunized, contained an antibody (known at the time as an antitoxin), which could then be injected into humans to cure the disease. Development of the sulfonamides rendered immunization against <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> unnecessary, but she continued to study other aspects of the disease. In 1941, she typed the streptococci of <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> which was an important breakthrough for tracking the epidemiology of the disease. Fraser also conducted research in an attempt to develop an antigen for tuberculosis. With the development of penicillin, her research after 1947, shifted focus to the study of antibiotics including bacitracin, penicillin, polymixin, and subtilin. Fraser studied various preparations of penicillin against the tubercular bacillus and as a treatment for gonorrhoea. Rising through the ranks of assistant professor and associate professor, Fraser became a full professor in 1949 teaching preventative medicine for the Bachelor of Science or nursing degree for the remainder of her career. In 1955 Fraser was appointed as a professor of microbiology and held that post until her retirement a decade later.|$|E
5|$|The Leigh Hospital Board bought Damhouse in 1893 {{for use as}} a {{sanatorium}} {{dealing with}} cases of diphtheria, <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> and, in 1947, poliomyelitis. Two bombs fell close to the hospital during the Second World War. It became a general hospital in 1948 dealing with chronically ill and geriatric patients and closed in 1994.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Henson's death, doctor David Gelmont first {{announced}} that he died from Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterial infection that causes bacterial pneumonia. However, on May 29, Gelmont later confirmed that Henson's {{cause of death was}} organ failure resulting from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (caused by Streptococcus pyogenes). S. pyogenes is the bacterial species that causes strep throat, <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever,</b> and rheumatic fever. It can also cause other infections.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Frank—then {{known as}} Wood—and his brother Ashman {{contracted}} <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever.</b> Frank survived, but Ashman {{died from the}} disease {{at the age of}} four. Between 1911 and 1916, Buckles attended school in Walker, Missouri. Later, he and his family moved to Oakwood, Oklahoma, where he continued his schooling and worked at a bank. He was an amateur wireless operator, and an avid reader of newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Streptococcal pharyngitis, {{also known}} as strep throat, is an {{infection}} {{of the back of}} the throat including the tonsils caused by group A streptococcus (GAS). Common symptoms include fever, sore throat, red tonsils, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. A headache, and nausea or vomiting may also occur. Some develop a sandpaper-like rash which is known as <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever.</b> Symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days.|$|E
5|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} Longstreet family in January 1862. A <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> {{epidemic}} in Richmond, Virginia claimed {{the lives of}} his one-year-old daughter Mary Anne, his four-year-old son James, and eleven-year-old Augustus ("Gus"), all within a week. His 13-year-old son Garland almost succumbed. The losses were devastating for Longstreet and he became withdrawn, both personally and socially. In 1861 his headquarters were noted for parties, drinking, and poker games. After he returned from the funeral the headquarters social life became for a time more somber. He rarely drank, and he became a devout Episcopalian.|$|E
5|$|According to Hinchliffe, {{this is an}} {{incorrect}} statement. Hinchliffe based his account on Rumpelhardt's testimony who claims that Schnaufer was never taken to England. Rumpelhardt was released on 4 August 1945 and soon after Schnaufer was admitted {{to a hospital in}} Flensburg, ill with a combination of diphtheria and <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever.</b> Interrogation had begun in late May 1945 by a team of twelve officers from the Department of Air Technical Intelligence (DAT), led by Air Commodore Roderick Aeneas Chisholm. The German prisoners were brought to Eggebek. Here they conducted a number of interviews with various members of the night fighter force.|$|E
5|$|As the Mozarts {{began to}} be noticed by the Viennese aristocracy, they were often {{required}} to give several performances during a single day. They were well rewarded for this activityat {{the end of their}} first hectic week in Vienna, Leopold was able to send home the equivalent of more than two years' salary. Their schedule was interrupted when Wolfgang fell ill with <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever,</b> and their former momentum was not regained. Nevertheless, the visit left Leopold eager to pursue further opportunities for social and financial success. On their return to Salzburg, Wolfgang played the harpsichord and violin at a birthday concert for the Archbishop, to the evident astonishment of those present.|$|E
5|$|Imagining the {{creation}} of an artistic community at Upton, Morris helped develop plans for a second house to be constructed adjacent to Red House in which Burne-Jones could live with his family; the plans were abandoned when Burne-Jones' son Philip died from <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever.</b> By 1864, Morris had become increasingly tired of life at Red House, being particularly unhappy with the 3 to 4 hours spent commuting to his London workplace on a daily basis. He sold Red House, and in autumn 1865 moved with his family to No. 26 Queen Square in Bloomsbury, the same building to which the Firm had moved its base of operations earlier in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the typhoon's tremendous impact, the Japanese military was deployed to Osaka before nightfall on September21 and water was being trucked in. Officials in Osaka Prefecture released an immediate ¥10million in relief funds. Baron Kischizaemon Sumitomo donated ¥1million (US$300,000) to relief funds, the largest such private donation in the nation's {{history at the}} time. The Cabinet of Japan held a special meeting to discuss emergency operations. Three destroyers from the Kure Naval District, loaded with medical equipment and other essentials, were deployed to assist in relief work. Outbreaks of typhoid fever, dysentery, and <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> plagued survivors in the storm's aftermath.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a typhus epidemic in the women's camp, Mengele cleared one block of 600 Jewish women {{and sent them to}} the gas chamber. The building was then cleaned and disinfected, and the occupants of a neighboring block were bathed, de-loused, and given new clothing before being moved into the clean block. The process was repeated until all the barracks were disinfected. Similar disinfections were used for later epidemics of <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> and other diseases, but with all the sick prisoners being sent to the gas chambers. For his efforts, Mengele was awarded the War Merit Cross (Second Class with Swords) and was promoted in 1944 to First Physician of the Birkenau subcamp.|$|E
5|$|The Heskeths' first child, Anna Maria (known as Maria to {{distinguish}} her from three close relatives named Anna), {{was born in}} 1827. Three more children—named Metcalfe Bold, Debonnaire and Frances—all died in infancy. In 1831 Hesketh changed his name by royal licence to Hesketh-Fleetwood, incorporating the better-known family name of his ancestors into his own. Debonnaire contracted tuberculosis and died in early 1833. Shortly before Debonnaire's death Hesketh-Fleetwood contracted <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever.</b> This was followed by erysipelas, a bacterial infection so severe that it necessitated the removal {{of one of his}} eyes. At the end of the year, the Rossall estate was severely flooded and suffered damage costing about £3,000 to repair. Hesketh-Fleetwood subsequently spent very little time at Rossall.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's elder sister, Elizabeth, {{was born}} in 1827. His younger sisters were Mary Hannah and Emma, who were born in 1832 and 1834 respectively. Mary Hannah died five months before Emma's birth, and Emma herself died in 1848. Douglas married Elizabeth Edmunds, a farmer's {{daughter}} from Bangor-is-y-Coed, Flintshire, on 25 January 1860 in StDunawd's Church in the village, a church he was later to restore. Initially the couple lived over the office at 6Abbey Square, and later they moved next door to No.4. Their five children were born in these houses, John Percy in 1861, Colin Edmunds in 1864, Mary Elizabeth in 1866, Sholto Theodore the following year, and Jerome in 1869. Only two of the children survived to adulthood; Mary Elizabeth died from <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> in 1868, Jerome lived {{for only a few}} days, and John Percy died aged 12 in 1873.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1907 Mahler, {{exhausted}} {{from the effects of}} the campaign against him in Vienna, took his family to Maiernigg. Soon after their arrival both daughters fell ill with <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> and diphtheria. Anna recovered, but after a fortnight's struggle Maria died on 12 July. Immediately following this devastating loss, Mahler learned that his heart was defective, a diagnosis subsequently confirmed by a Vienna specialist, who ordered a curtailment of all forms of vigorous exercise. The extent to which Mahler's condition disabled him is unclear; Alma wrote of it as a virtual death sentence, though Mahler himself, in a letter written to her on 30 August 1907, said that {{he would be able to}} live a normal life, apart from avoiding over-fatigue. The illness was, however, a further depressing factor; at the end of the summer the villa at Maiernigg was closed, and never revisited.|$|E

25|$|A serious <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> {{outbreak}} in 1874 instigated {{the opening of}} a fever hospital in Coventry known as the City Isolation Hospital. The first stop-gap hospital was replaced by a larger one in 1885, where <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> and diphtheria were the principal diseases dealt with after a separate smallpox hospital was erected at Pinley Hill Farm in 1897.|$|E

25|$|It {{was with}} Davis's {{encouragement}} that Mitchel wrote his first book, Life of Hugh O'Neill, which Davis {{never got to}} see published: Davis died on 16 September 1845, of <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever.</b> Following the publication of Hugh O'Neill, Charles Gavan Duffy proposed that Mitchel join the staff of The Nation.|$|E
25|$|Jay's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} {{due to the}} effects of <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> as a child, and she {{died at the age of}} only 47, in Monte Carlo, having been on a cruise with her husband. In recognition of her achievements, the Royal Academy of Music two years later instituted the Isabel Jay Memorial Prize.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. It {{may be due}} to an {{infection}} triggering an autoimmune response in those who are genetically predisposed. It does not spread between people. Diagnosis is usually based on a person's signs and symptoms. Other tests such as an ultrasound of the heart and blood tests may support the diagnosis. Other conditions that may present similarly include <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|He {{investigated}} its positive anti-bacterial {{effect on}} many organisms, {{and noticed that}} it affected bacteria such as staphylococci and many other Gram-positive pathogens that cause <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever,</b> pneumonia, meningitis and diphtheria, but not typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever, which are caused by Gram-negative bacteria, {{for which he was}} seeking a cure at the time. It also affected Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhoea although this bacterium is Gram-negative.|$|E
25|$|In 1849, Anne caught <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever</b> {{along with}} her two sisters, and her health {{thereafter}} declined; some authorities believe that she suffered from tuberculosis. In vain pursuit of help from Gully's water cure, Charles Darwin took his daughter to the Worcestershire spa town, Great Malvern. She died in Montreal House on the Worcester Road, aged ten, and {{was buried in the}} Great Malvern Priory churchyard.|$|E
25|$|A shy child, Stewart {{spent much}} of his after-school time in the {{basement}} working on model airplanes, mechanical drawing and chemistry—all with a dream of going into aviation. It was a dream greatly enhanced by the legendary 1927 flight of Charles Lindbergh, whose progress 19-year-old Stewart, then stricken with <b>scarlet</b> <b>fever,</b> was himself avidly following from home; thus foreshadowing his starring movie role as Lindbergh 30 years later.|$|E
25|$|Morse's {{success as}} an {{entertainer}} {{took its toll}} on her personal life. Her husband, Elmer Morse, had created a home for her complete with furnishings he'd built himself.
