40|$|New {{technology}} in the automotive industry {{is the key to}} success. Therefore, it is appreciated when people come with new design ways to solve problems. This leads to innovation in the automotive industry that will lead to better and more environmentally friendly cars. This report presents a concept on a pushing counter lever spring which provides the same characteristics of force curve as a diaphragm <b>spring</b> in a <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> of a car has. The mechanism is to be used for long-term testing and evaluating clutch pedals. The work describes the development process and the manufacture of a prototype. The program Creo (CAD / 3 D) is largely used to construct the components. As are the subprograms Mechanism Design and Simulate to simulate the movement and loads. Excel is a great help at the theoretical calculation of the mechanism and to evaluate the theory behind the concept. The result shows how to simulate a diaphragm <b>spring</b> in the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> in a car for long-term testing of clutch pedals. The goal is to accurately mimic the force curve of a diaphragm spring, in order to design better pedals, and thus reduce the weight on the pedals to in turn reduce fuel consumption to protect the environment {{is one of the most}} important factors of all in the automotive industry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A typical {{clutch system}} for {{automotive}} manual transmissions transfers hydraulic pressure generated by driver's pedal manipulation to the clutch diaphragm spring. The foot effort history {{during the period}} of push is different than the period of the clutch pedal’s return. The effort or load difference is called clutch foot effort hysteresis. It is known that the hysteresis is caused by friction. The frictional force and moment are produced between various component contact points such as between the rubber seal and the inner wall inside the hydraulic cylinder and between the diaphragm <b>spring</b> and the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> etc. Understanding the clutch pedal foot effort hysteresis is essential for a clutch release system design and analysis. The dynamic model for a clutch release system is developed for the foot effort hysteresis prediction and a simulation analysis is performed to propose a tool for analysing a clutch system...|$|R
50|$|The NV-41 was a wooden-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} blast mine {{used during}} the Second World War. The mine consists of a square wooden box with a filling plug on the bottom.

While {{the fact}} that {{abrasion}} leads to change of surface topography is taken into consideration, the influence of <b>spring</b> <b>pressure</b> both on leakage rate and on friction characteristic of contacting mechanical seals are investigated by fractal theory. Several GY- 70 type mechanical seals are tested.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that soil–water {{characteristic}} curve (SWCC) {{plays an important role in}} unsaturated soil mechanics, but the measurement of SWCC is inconvenient.

In this study, the effects of sample dimensions and shapes on the balance time of measuring SWCCs using <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> tests and the shape of SWCCs are investigated. It can be found that the sample dimensions and shapes have apparent influence on the balance time. The testing durations for circular samples with smaller diameters and annular samples with larger contact area are significantly shortened. However, there is little effect of sample dimensions and shapes on the shape of SWCCs. Its mechanism is explored and discussed in details through analysing the principle of <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> tests and microstructure of the sample.

5000|$|There are {{multiple}} designs of vehicle clutch, {{but most are}} based on one or more friction discs pressed tightly together or against a flywheel using springs. The friction material varies in composition depending on many considerations such as whether the clutch is [...] "dry" [...] or [...] "wet". Friction discs once contained asbestos, but this has been largely discontinued. Clutches found in heavy duty applications such as trucks and competition cars use ceramic plates that have a greatly increased friction coefficient. However, these have a [...] "grabby" [...] action generally considered unsuitable for passenger cars. The <b>spring</b> <b>pressure</b> is released when the clutch pedal is depressed thus either pushing or pulling the diaphragm of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> depending on type. Raising the engine speed too high while engaging the clutch causes excessive clutch plate wear. Engaging the clutch abruptly when the engine is turning at high speed causes a harsh, jerky start. This kind of start is necessary and desirable in drag racing and other competitions, where speed {{is more important than}} comfort.|$|R

The Tellermine 43 can also be fitted with an optional tilt-rod fuze, which is screwed into the side fuze well. Anti-tank mines with this type of fuze were capable of inflicting much more damage to armored vehicles. This was demonstrated numerous times in the Normandy Campaign.
