5|$|Another {{chemical}} {{of interest}} found in P.indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural, which has attracted attention as a tyrosinase inhibitor.

Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs naturally in several foods, is not associated with serious health risks. P.indusiatus also contains a unique ribonuclease (an enzyme that cuts RNA into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.|$|E

These motions {{give rise to a}} conformational ensemble of slightly different structures that interconvert with one another at equilibrium. Different states within this ensemble may be associated with different aspects of an enzyme's function.
