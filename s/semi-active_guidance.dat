50|$|The {{inherent}} {{disadvantage of}} the radar beam riding {{system is that}} the beam spreads as it travels outward from the broadcaster. As the missile flies towards the target, it therefore becomes increasingly inaccurate. This {{is not a problem}} at short ranges, but as many early surface-to-air missiles were designed to work at long ranges, this was a major issue. For example, earlier versions of the RIM-2 Terrier missile introduced in the 1950s were beam riders, but later variants employed semi-active radar homing to improve their effectiveness against high-performance and low-flying targets. In contrast to beam riding, <b>semi-active</b> <b>guidance</b> becomes more accurate as the missile approaches the target.|$|E
50|$|The Petrel {{was never}} {{considered}} {{a very high}} priority by the U.S. Navy, which was far {{more concerned about the}} threat from submarines than surface ships. New submarine designs powered by nuclear reactors were beginning to appear in the mid-1950s, vessels which could remain submerged indefinitely. As a result the prospects of catching an enemy submarine on the surface were receding, and more emphasis was being placed on underwater engagements. The use of <b>semi-active</b> <b>guidance</b> also required the launching aircraft to continue closing the target throughout the missile's flight, exposing it to a far greater danger from enemy defenses. The AUM-N-2 was initially assigned only to reserve units. In 1959 the missiles were withdrawn from reserve service and converted to serve as air-launched target drones.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a two mass oscillator, a translatoric {{moving mass}} {{connected}} to a rigid beam by a spring-damper system, is used to numerically investigate the capability of load path redistribution due to controlled <b>semi-active</b> <b>guidance</b> elements with friction brakes. The mathematical friction model will be derived by the LUGRE approach. The rigid beam is embedded on two supports and is initially aligned with evenly distributed loads in beam and supports by the same stiffness condition. With the semi-active auxiliary kinematic guidance elements {{it is possible to}} provide additional forces to relieve one of the beam’s supports. Two control strategies are designed and compared to induce additional forces in the auxiliary guidance elements to bypass portions of loading away from the spring-damper system towards the now kinetic auxiliary guidance elements. They depend on the different control inputs: I beam misalignment and II desired reaction force ratio in the supports. The beam’s misalignment and the supports’ reaction forces are calculated numerically for varying stiffness parameters of the supports and are compared with and without semi-active auxiliary kinematic guidance elements. The structure’s moving mass is loaded with a force according to a step-function. Thus, undesired misalignment caused by varying stiffness as well as undesired load distribution in the structure’s supports can be reduced by shifting load between the supports during operation...|$|E
40|$|Load-bearing {{structures}} with kinematic functions enable and disable {{degrees of}} freedom and are part of many mechanical engineering applications. The relative movements between a wheel and {{the body of a}} car or a landing gear and an aircraft fuselage are examples for load-bearing systems with defined kinematics. In most cases, the load is transmitted through a predetermined load path of a host structure to the structural support interfaces. However, uncertainty due to unexpected load peaks or varying health condition, e. g. changes in stiffness or damping parameters over time of the structure’s components may require an adjustment of the load path for safety reasons. Load paths transmitted through damaged or weakened components can be the reason for reduced comfort or even failure. For example, reduced support stiffness can lead to uncertain and undesirable misalignment in the structure. In this paper, a two mass oscillator, a translatoric moving mass connected to a rigid beam by a spring-damper system, is used to numerically investigate the capability of load path adaption due to controlled <b>semi-active</b> <b>guidance</b> elements with friction brakes. The mathematical friction model will be derived by the LuGre approach. The rigid beam is embedded on two supports and is initially aligned with evenly distributed loads in beam and supports by the same stiffness condition. However, if uneven support stiffness occurs, e. g. by damage or fatigue, the beam becomes misaligned. One sided lowering of the beam may follow. Two auxiliary kinematic guidance elements are used to redirect the load path depending on the beam’s alignment condition. With the semi-active auxiliary kinematic guidance elements it is possible to provide additional forces to relieve one of the beam’s support if it changes its stiffness. The beams’s misalignment is calculated numerically for varying stiffness parameters of the supports and is compared with and without semi-active auxiliary kinematic guidance elements. The structure is loaded with a force according to a step-function and a simple signal-based feedback PID-controller is designed to induce additional forces in the auxiliary guidance elements to bypass portions of loading away from supports with decreasing stiffness. Thus, uncertainty due to unacceptable misalignment caused by varying stiffness conditions of the structure’s supports can be reduced by shifting load between the supports during operation...|$|E

50|$|The LAHAT is {{designed}} to achieve a 95 percent probability of kill under most conditions. It has a <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>guidance</b> system, capable of both direct and indirect laser designation—the target can be laser-designated by the launching platform (e.g. firing tank) or other platform (e.g. another tank, helicopter, UAV, or forward scouting team), requiring minimal exposure in the firing position. With a low launch signature, the missile’s trajectory can be set to match either top attack (armoured fighting vehicle, warship) or direct attack (helicopter gunship) engagements.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to these, the XM1111 (Mid-Range-Munition Chemical Energy) {{was also in}} development. The XM1111 was a guided munition using a dual-mode seeker that combined imaging-infrared and <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>guidance.</b> The MRM-CE was selected over the competing MRM-KE which used a rocket-assisted kinetic energy penetrator. The CE variant was chosen due to its better effects against secondary targets, providing a more versatile weapon. The Army hoped to achieve IOC with the XM1111 by 2013. However, the Mid-Range Munition was cancelled in 2009 along with Future Combat Systems.|$|R
50|$|Retransmission homing, {{also called}} Track Via Missile or TVM, is a hybrid between command <b>guidance,</b> <b>semi-active</b> radar homing and active radar homing.

50|$|During the 1970s the Republic of Korea Navy {{decided to}} import Exocet anti-ship {{missiles}} to deter North Korean naval provocations. Considering {{the fact that}} the DPRK Navy was then and now mostly composed of numerous small to midsize ships, a cheap, small guided anti-ship missile was proposed. In 1978 the Korean Agency for Defense Development (ADD) started the development of the Hae Ryong anti-ship missile, and by 1987 the ROK Navy approved for the mass production of the missiles. But the Hae Ryong was fitted with a <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>guidance</b> system, limiting its tactical capability during bad weather. Additional pressure from the USA ultimately resulted in the termination of the project.|$|R

The weapon had been in development for 18 months and undergone initial test drops in August 2013. In comparison to the LMM, the FFLMM removes the rocket motor and associated components while keeping the body and control actuators, as well as adding INS and GPS navigation, <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>guidance</b> {{in place of the}} beam-riding system, and four enlarged fins for increased lift.|$|R
50|$|The Raytheon MIM-23 Hawk is an American medium-range surface-to-air missile. It was {{designed}} to be a much more mobile counterpart to the MIM-14 Nike Hercules, trading off range and altitude capability for a much smaller size and weight. Its low-level performance was greatly improved over Nike through the adoption of new radars and a continuous wave <b>semi-active</b> radar homing <b>guidance</b> system.|$|R
50|$|Armament {{interceptor}} {{includes four}} supersonic (M>5) UR great range R-40T (R-40TD) air-to-air missiles with thermal homing head and R-40P (R-40RD) with <b>semi-active</b> radar <b>guidance</b> system (maximum launch range, on altitudinal goal {{on a collision}} course - 35-60 km). A fuel tank can be suspended under the fuselage. The aircraft could carry unguided gravity bombs in a rudimentary strike capability. As the bombs would weigh no more and incur no more drag than its regular load of R-40 missiles, its performance was not impaired, leading to some impressive bombing feats; when released at an altitude of 20,000m (66,000 ft) and a speed above Mach 2, a 500 kg bomb would have a glide range of several tens of kilometres.|$|R
50|$|The {{projectiles}} use laser guidance. A cone {{of laser}} light divided into sectors is projected from the launching tank/vehicle/gun, each sector having a different frequency or modulation. The missile {{has a small}} window in the rear with a sensor to detect the modulation of the light. Using this modulation, the missile steers itself, maintaining {{its position in the}} cone. The laser beam-riding guidance system is smaller than a radio command one, and cheaper and simpler than <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>guidance.</b> The missile is also not prone to radio or optical jamming. On the other hand, a target has to be tracked by laser sight all the time, and the system can not be reliably used on the move.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the signal}} being {{reflected}} off the target also forms a cone shape centred on the target, {{but with a}} much greater spread angle. This leads {{to one of the}} most common types of radar-based missile <b>guidance,</b> <b>semi-active</b> radar homing, or SARH. This places a small receiver in the nose of the missile that listens for the signals reflected off the target, and therefore grows more accurate and powerful as the missile approaches the target.|$|R
50|$|This is the Chinese {{equivalent}} of French Mistral missile, with fuse developed {{from that of}} QW-2. The missile is unique among Chinese MANPAD in {{that this is the}} only surface-to-air missile that adopts the <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>guidance</b> similar to AGM-114 Hellfire. The gyro stabilized seeker provides very high degree of accuracy and is extremely effective against low altitude cruise missiles. The 15 degrees per second tracking rate of the seeker is relatively low in comparison for other MANPAD for supersonic targets in high g maneuver at very high altitudes, but this is by no means handicapping the performance because such targets are not intended to be for QW-3, which is specifically designed to engage terrain hugging helicopters and UAV’s and other fast flying targets at extremely low altitudes, including supersonic sea skimming cruise missiles.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of CIWS systems. A gun-based CIWS usually {{consists}} of a combination of radars, computers, and multiple-barrel, rotary rapid-fire cannons placed on a rotating gun mount. Missile systems use infra-red, passive radar/ESM or <b>semi-active</b> radar terminal <b>guidance</b> to guide missiles to the targeted enemy aircraft or other threats. In some cases, CIWS are used on land to protect military bases. In this case, the CIWS can also protect the base from shell and rocket fire.|$|R

50|$|Raytheon is {{continuing}} to fund {{the development of the}} Sea Griffin to extend the missile's range. The Sea Griffin will use a dual-mode seeker with an imaging infrared seeker and <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>guidance,</b> and a data-link to track multiple threats simultaneously and give it a fire-and-forget capability. The new seeker and an extended-range rocket motor, which will add 9.1 kg, will increase the range of the Sea Griffin to 15 km. In tests, the Sea Griffin's new imaging infrared (IIR) seeker has streamed video back to operators through the data-link to provide verification before the missile strikes the target. Its In-Flight Target Update (IFTU) capability allows it to be redirected to a new target in mid-flight, a vital feature against swarming small boats moving between friendly forces and neutral shipping. The Sea Griffin has been renamed the Griffin C.|$|R
50|$|The Mokopa is a South African {{air-to-ground}} missile, designed {{primarily for}} use as an anti-tank weapon. It is currently in its final stages of development, and is being integrated onto the South African Air Force's Rooivalk attack helicopters. The missile is produced by Denel Dynamics, formerly Kentron. The current version uses <b>Semi-Active</b> Laser (SAL) <b>guidance,</b> requiring the target to be illuminated by a laser designator either on the launch platform or elsewhere; though there are alternative guidance packages available including a millimetre-wave radar (MMW) seeker and a two-colour imaging infrared (IIR) seeker.|$|R
50|$|A laser-guided bomb (LGB) is {{a guided}} bomb that uses <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>guidance</b> {{to strike a}} {{designated}} target with greater accuracy than an unguided bomb. First developed by the United States during the Vietnam War, laser-guided bombs quickly proved their value in precision strikes of difficult point targets. These weapons use on-board electronics to track targets that are designated by laser, typically in the infrared spectrum, and adjust their glide path to precisely strike the target. Since the weapon is tracking a light signature, not the object itself, the target must be illuminated from a separate source, either by ground forces, by a pod on the attacking aircraft, or by a separate support aircraft.Data from Vietnam showed that laser-guided bombs achieved direct hits nearly 50% of the time, versus just 5.5% for unguided bombs. Because of this dramatically higher precision, laser-guided munitions can carry less explosive and cause less collateral damage than unguided munitions. Today, laser-guided bombs {{are one of the}} most common and widespread guided bombs, used by a large number of the world's air forces.|$|R
50|$|The GD/Westinghouse {{design was}} even smaller, with a multiple-pulse pure solid rocket motor. It {{also had an}} {{inertial}} guidance system, but midcourse updating was provided via a dual-band <b>semi-active</b> radar. Terminal <b>guidance</b> was via an electro-optical sensor, with a backup infrared seeker also included. One flaw of semi-active radar homing is that the launch aircraft must illuminate the target with its radar during flight, meaning that it must fly towards the enemy and so expose itself to greater danger. GD/Westinghouse planned to avoid this by equipping the launching aircraft with a radar pod which could illuminate the target from both forward and aft, allowing it to turn and escape whilst still providing a target for the missile.|$|R
500|$|The Israeli Army {{introduced}} a new round known as the Laser Homing Anti-Tank (LAHAT) projectile. Using a <b>semi-active</b> laser homing <b>guidance</b> method, the LAHAT can be guided by the tank's crew or by teams on the ground, while the missile's trajectory can be selected to either attack from the top (to defeat enemy armor) or direct attack (to engage enemy helicopters). Furthermore, the missile can be fired by both [...] and 120mm tank guns. The LAHAT has been offered as an option for the Leopard 2, and has been marketed by both Israel Military Industries and Rheinmetall to Leopard 2 users. Israeli Merkavas make use of a round known as the APAM, which is an anti-personnel munition designed to release fragmentation at controlled intervals to limit the extent of damage. Fragments are shaped to have enough kinetic energy to penetrate body armor.|$|R
50|$|From 2011-2015, the Marines and Raytheon {{developed}} the precision extended range munition (PERM) for the EFSS, a GPS-guided round that delivers greater range and better accuracy. The 35 lb round increases range from 8 km to 16 km, falling within 10 meters {{of the target}} and as close as two meters, costing $18,000 each, and having 2.5-3 times more lethality. The extra range comes from tail fins for stabilization and canards near the nose to make in-flight adjustments and make it glide as it descends, and the greater lethality {{is a result of}} this flight path; normal artillery rounds impact at a 45 degree angle, which blows {{the top half of the}} round straight up into the air, but descending at a sharp angle places more energy and fragmentation directly on a target. It is even capable of hitting reverse slope positions by shaping its trajectory. Greater accuracy also reduces logistical burdens, as using fewer rounds to destroy one target means a unit can last longer without needing resupply. The PERM will begin fielding in 2018. Raytheon plans to add <b>semi-active</b> laser (SAL) <b>guidance</b> to PERM rounds to enable them to hit moving targets.|$|R
5000|$|The Hellfire II, {{developed}} in the early 1990s is a modular missile system with several variants. Hellfire II's semi-active laser variants—AGM-114K high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT), AGM-114KII with external blast fragmentation sleeve, AGM-114M (blast fragmentation), and AGM-114N metal augmented charge (MAC)—achieve pinpoint accuracy by homing in on a reflected laser beam aimed at the target. Predator, Reaper and AH 665 Tiger, UCAVs carry the Hellfire II, but the most common platform is the AH-64 Apache helicopter gunship, which can carry up to 16 of the missiles at once. The AGM-114L, or Longbow Hellfire, is a fire-and-forget weapon: equipped with a millimeter wave (MMW) radar seeker, it requires no further guidance after launch—even being able to lock-on to its target after launch—and can hit its target without the launcher or other friendly unit being {{in line of sight}} of the target. It also works in adverse weather and battlefield obscurants, such as smoke and fog which can mask the position of a target or prevent a designating laser from forming a detectable reflection. Each Hellfire weighs 47 kg, including the 9 kg warhead, and has a range of 8000 m. The AGM-114R [...] "Romeo" [...] Hellfire II entered service in late 2012. It uses a <b>semi-active</b> laser homing <b>guidance</b> system and an integrated blast fragmentation sleeve warhead to engage targets that previously needed multiple Hellfire variants. It will replace AGM-114K, M, N, and P variants in U.S. service.|$|R
40|$|ITC/USA 2008 Conference Proceedings / The Forty-Fourth Annual International Telemetering Conference and Technical Exhibition / October 27 - 30, 2008 / Town and Country Resort & Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe U. S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is {{exploring}} technologies to provide low-cost precision fires, applicable across both {{direct and indirect}} fire weapon systems. One of these applications involves a forward observer (FO) designating the target with a laser spot and a seeker on-board the munition detecting the reflected energy to allow terminal guidance. This approach, referred to as <b>semi-active</b> laser (SAL) <b>guidance,</b> has been utilized on numerous air-delivered munitions to include bombs, missiles and projectiles. However, the cost of these systems, driven by high quality optics, high sensitivity detectors and specialized electronics, has hampered their migration into gun-fired munitions such as mortars, artillery and grenades. To explore, develop and demonstrate minimal cost solutions, ARL invested in an Army Technical Objective (ATO) called Smaller, Lighter, Cheaper Munition Components (SLCMC). Specifically, SAL seeker hardware, predicated upon commercial components (COTS) and mass production techniques, is being prototyped for use with gun launched projectiles and laser target designators. The seeker system is comprised of several printed circuit board boards, a microprocessor, a quad-photo detector and, a molded optical lens unit. This seeker is designed to rapidly update the projectile boresight angle, interface with other strap-down sensors, and feed data into an on-board guidance, navigation & control (G,N&C) system to allow for projectile maneuvers. The seeker design and basic characteristics are discussed and presented through-out the paper and presentation...|$|R
