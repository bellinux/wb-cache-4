5|$|In {{the world}} of Chocobo Racing, Magic Stones are {{scattered}} throughout each course, and can {{be picked up by}} the player by driving through them. Magic Stones can also be stolen from opponent players by bumping into another player. The player can then activate the Magic <b>Stone</b> for some special effect. Activating a Haste <b>Stone,</b> for example, gives the character a short speed boost. In some Magic Stones, the power of the <b>stone</b> increases if more than one of the same <b>stone</b> is picked up by the player. Each <b>stone</b> is represented by a corresponding symbol on the racetrack, while stones marked with question marks represent random Magic Stones, which grant the player either a Haste <b>Stone,</b> Fire <b>Stone,</b> Ice <b>Stone,</b> Thunder <b>Stone,</b> Minimize <b>Stone,</b> Reflect <b>Stone,</b> Doom <b>Stone,</b> or Ultima <b>Stone.</b>|$|E
5|$|A legend about acquacotta {{exists in}} {{relation}} to the concept of <b>stone</b> soup, which is generally based upon a premise of a poor traveler who arrived at a village having only a <b>stone,</b> but convinced the villagers to add ingredients to his <b>stone</b> soup, creating acquacotta; variations of the legend exist.|$|E
5|$|According to some scholars, the Black <b>Stone</b> was {{the same}} <b>stone</b> that Islamic {{tradition}} describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. This led to a debate about whether the Black Stone's greeting comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, whether the <b>stone</b> was a living creature or an inanimate object. Whichever was the case, the <b>stone</b> was held to be a symbol of prophethood.|$|E

2500|$|When {{symptoms}} indicate bladder <b>stones,</b> {{the first}} step is usually to take an x-ray. [...] Most types of <b>stones</b> will appear readily in an x-ray, urate and occasionally cystine <b>stones</b> being the most common exceptions. [...] <b>Stones</b> smaller than three millimeters may not be visible. [...] Ultrasonography is also useful for identifying bladder <b>stones.</b> [...] Crystals identified in a urinalysis may help identify the <b>stones,</b> but analysis of the <b>stones</b> is necessary for identification of the complete chemical composition.|$|R
50|$|Go bowls, or go-ke are the {{containers}} for the <b>stones.</b> Although not strictly needed to play Go, bowls nevertheless {{play an important}} role in storing the <b>stones,</b> and captured <b>stones</b> can be placed on the lids.

5|$|Allen {{acquired}} the <b>stone</b> quarries at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines. He used the unique honey-coloured Bath <b>stone,</b> {{used to build}} the Georgian city, {{and as a result}} made a second fortune. Allen built a railway line from his mine on Combe Down which carried the <b>stone</b> down the hill, now known as Ralph Allen Drive, which runs beside Prior Park, to a wharf he constructed at Bath Locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal to transport <b>stone</b> to London. Following a failed bid to supply <b>stone</b> to buildings in London, Allen wanted a building which would show off the properties of Bath <b>stone</b> as a building material.|$|E

50|$|Rocking <b>stones</b> (also {{known as}} logan <b>stones</b> or logans) are large <b>stones</b> {{that are so}} finely {{balanced}} that the application of just a small force causes them to rock. Typically, rocking <b>stones</b> are residual corestones formed initially by spheroidal weathering and have later been exposed by erosion or glacial erratics left by retreating glaciers. Natural rocking <b>stones</b> are found throughout the world. A few rocking <b>stones</b> might be man-made megaliths.|$|R

5|$|At the {{national}} convention of 1856, <b>Stone</b> presented {{a new strategy}} suggested by Antoinette Brown Blackwell to send a memorial to the various state legislatures signed by the officers of the National Woman’s Rights Convention. Antoinette Brown had married Samuel Charles Blackwell on January 24, 1856, becoming Stone's sister-in-law in the process. <b>Stone,</b> Brown Blackwell and Ernestine Rose were appointed a committee {{to carry out the}} plan. <b>Stone</b> drafted and printed the appeal, and Brown Blackwell mailed it to twenty-five state legislatures. Indiana and Pennsylvania referred the memorial to select committees, while both Massachusetts and Maine granted hearings. On March 6, 1857, <b>Stone,</b> Wendell Phillips and James Freeman Clarke addressed the Judiciary Committee of the Massachusetts senate, and on March 10, <b>Stone</b> and Phillips addressed a select committee of the Maine legislature.|$|E
5|$|Chased by the shadow, Ged flees to Osskil, seeking {{advice from}} the <b>stone</b> of the Terrenon. He is {{attacked}} on the way by the shadow, which destroys his staff, but Ged escapes into the Court of Terrenon. Serret, {{the lady of the}} castle, shows him the <b>stone</b> of Terrenon, and tempts Ged to speak to it, claiming it can give him limitless knowledge and power. Believing the <b>stone</b> harbors an evil spirit, Ged refuses. Realizing that the servants of the <b>stone</b> wish to enslave him, he flees. He is pursued by the stone's minions but transforms into a falcon and flies away.|$|E
5|$|Chetro Ketl's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} using three bulk materials: <b>stone,</b> clay-sand, and water. Two types of <b>stone</b> were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone {{that forms the}} bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular <b>stone</b> as {{it was easier to}} shape, but much of it had to be dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan <b>stone</b> of the cliff faces was easier to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown <b>stone</b> beds had been depleted.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{tradition}} {{that it is impossible}} to count the number of <b>stones</b> within Castlerigg; every attempt will result in a different answer. This tradition, however, may not be far from the truth. Due to erosion of the soil around the <b>stones,</b> caused by the large number of visitors to the monument, several smaller <b>stones</b> have ‘appeared’ next to some of the larger <b>stones.</b> Because these <b>stones</b> are so small, they are likely to have been packing <b>stones</b> used to support the larger <b>stones</b> when the circle was constructed and would originally have been buried. Differences in opinion as to the exact number of <b>stones</b> within Castlerigg are usually down to whether the observer counts these small packing <b>stones,</b> or not; some count 38 and others, 42. The ‘official’ number of <b>stones,</b> as represented on the National Trust information board at the monument, is 40.|$|R
50|$|The circle {{consists}} of two rings of <b>stones,</b> the outer measuring 26 m and consisting of 15 <b>stones</b> and the inner being 9 m wide and consisting of 10 <b>stones.</b> None of the <b>stones</b> is more than 0.6m tall.|$|R

5|$|Coatbridge {{was given}} burgh status in 1885, and {{was granted a}} coat of arms by the Lord Lyon in 1892. The arms have a black field and on it a flaming tower to {{represent}} a blast furnace and Coatbridge's industrial tradition. The crest is a monk holding a <b>stone</b> in his left hand. The <b>stone</b> relates to the old parish of Monklands and {{the legend of the}} 'aul' Kirk stane'. The legend of the 'aul' Kirk stane' is that a pilgrim undertaking a penance from Glasgow carried a <b>stone</b> in the direction of Monklands. When he could carry the <b>stone</b> no further (or in another version of the legend, when an angel spoke to him) he laid the <b>stone</b> down. It was where the <b>stone</b> came to rest that he was to build a church. The church is the present day Old Monkland Kirk, at which the <b>stone</b> can still be seen.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{appointed}} one {{justice to}} the Supreme Court of the United States, Harlan Fiske <b>Stone</b> in 1925. <b>Stone</b> was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus, a Wall Street lawyer and conservative Republican. <b>Stone</b> was serving as dean of Columbia Law School when Coolidge appointed him to be attorney general in 1924 to restore the reputation tarnished by Harding's Attorney General, Harry M. Daugherty. It does not appear that Coolidge considered appointing anyone other than <b>Stone.</b> <b>Stone</b> {{proved to be a}} firm believer in judicial restraint and was {{regarded as one of the}} court's three liberal justices who would often vote to uphold New Deal legislation.

50|$|Traditional <b>stones</b> {{are made}} so that black <b>stones</b> are {{slightly}} larger in diameter than white; {{this is to}} compensate for the optical illusion created by contrasting colors that would make equal-sized white <b>stones</b> appear larger on the board than black <b>stones.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the composition of common duct gall <b>stones</b> from 61 patients, aged 49 - 94. The <b>stones</b> were collected endoscopically with a dormia basket after endoscopic papillotomy. The cholesterol content was measured both by infrared spectroscopy (mean 29 %, range 0 - 99 %) and enzymatically (mean 23 %, range 0 - 96 %). The results of the two measurements showed good correlation (r 2 = 0. 92), indicating that cholesterol can be adequately measured enzymatically. Most of the <b>stones</b> were pigment <b>stones.</b> When examined by infrared spectroscopy, 44 <b>stones</b> (72 %) contained less than 50 % cholesterol (mean 4 %, range 0 - 23 %). The bilirubinate content in these <b>stones</b> was 56 %, range 12 - 100 %. Forty two of these <b>stones</b> were brown <b>stones,</b> and only two were black <b>stones.</b> Pigment <b>stones</b> were associated with juxtapapillary diverticula (p < 0. 01). It was found that brown pigment <b>stones</b> were the commonest symptomatic bile duct calculi in the patients studied, who are representative of a Western population...|$|R

5|$|Falker Island is a {{crescent-shaped}} island located {{three and}} a half miles offshore of Guilford, Connecticut. The island has had several owners including Andrew Leete in the 1600s. In 1715, Caleb and Ebenezer <b>Stone</b> purchased the island, which remained in the <b>Stone</b> family until 1801. In 1800, Noah <b>Stone</b> sold it to a distant relative, Medad <b>Stone,</b> for $158.34. On May 12, 1801, Medad <b>Stone</b> sold the island to the government for $325. Joel Henderson, a historian, notes that Medad <b>Stone</b> and the government were likely openly communicating about the island. The United States Congress had appropriated $6000 in March 1801 for the lighthouse, prior to the government's acquisition of the property.|$|E

5|$|Henry II came to {{the throne}} in 1154 and built {{extensively}} at Windsor between 1165 and 1179. Henry replaced the wooden palisade surrounding the upper ward with a <b>stone</b> wall interspersed with square towers and built the first King's Gate.

Henry replaced the keep with another <b>stone</b> shell keep and chemise wall, but moved the walls in {{from the edge of the}} motte to relieve the pressure on the mound, and added massive foundations along the south side to provide additional support.
