5|$|In 1993, Enron {{established}} {{a joint venture}} in energy investments with CalPERS, the California state pension fund, called the Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI). In 1997, Skilling, serving as Chief Operating Officer (COO), asked CalPERS to join Enron in a separate investment. CalPERS {{was interested in the}} idea, but only if it could be terminated as a partner in JEDI. However, Enron did not want to show any debt from assuming CalPERS' stake in JEDI on its balance sheet. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Fastow developed the <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entity</b> Chewco Investments limited partnership (L.P.) which raised debt guaranteed by Enron and was used to acquire CalPERS's joint venture stake for $383 million. Because of Fastow's organization of Chewco, JEDI's losses were kept off of Enron's balance sheet.|$|E
5|$|In November 2000, the State Government and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) {{signed a}} {{memorandum}} of understanding on the airport project, establishing it as a public–private partnership. The State and AAI together would hold a 26% stake in the project, while the remaining 74% would be allotted to private companies. Through a bidding process, a consortium consisting of GMR Group and Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB) {{was chosen as the}} holder of the 74% stake. In December 2002, Hyderabad International Airport Ltd (HIAL), later renamed GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited (GHIAL), was created as a <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entity,</b> into which the State, AAI and GMR–MAHB placed their stakes.|$|E
5|$|Whitewing was {{the name}} of a <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entity</b> used as a {{financing}} method by Enron. In December 1997, with funding of $579 million provided by Enron and $500 million by an outside investor, Whitewing Associates L.P. was formed. Two years later, the entity's arrangement was changed so that it would no longer be consolidated with Enron and be counted on the company's balance sheet. Whitewing was used to purchase Enron assets, including stakes in power plants, pipelines, stocks, and other investments. Between 1999 and 2001, Whitewing bought assets from Enron worth $2 billion, using Enron stock as collateral. Although the transactions were approved by the Enron board, the asset transfers were not true sales and should have been treated instead as loans.|$|E
5|$|The <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities</b> {{were used}} {{for more than just}} {{circumventing}} accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities.</b> However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities</b> were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities</b> that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|R

5|$|Before its scandal, Enron was lauded for its {{sophisticated}} {{financial risk}} management tools. Risk management was crucial to Enron {{not only because of}} its regulatory environment, but also because of its business plan. Enron established long-term fixed commitments which needed to be hedged to prepare for the invariable fluctuation of future energy prices. Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities.</b> By hedging its risks with <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities</b> which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.|$|R
5|$|Giles Darby, David Bermingham, and Gary Mulgrew {{worked for}} Greenwich NatWest. The three British men {{had worked with}} Fastow on a <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entity</b> he had started called Swap Sub. When Fastow was being {{investigated}} by the SEC, the three men met with the British Financial Services Authority (FSA) in November 2001 to discuss their interactions with Fastow. In June 2002, the U.S. issued warrants for their arrest on seven counts of wire fraud, and they were then extradited. On July 12, a potential Enron witness scheduled to be extradited to the U.S., Neil Coulbeck, {{was found dead in}} a park in north-east London. Coulbeck's death was eventually ruled to have been a suicide. The U.S. case alleged that Coulbeck and others conspired with Fastow. In a plea bargain in November 2007, the trio plead guilty to one count of wire fraud while the other six counts were dismissed. Darby, Bermingham, and Mulgrew were each sentenced to 37 months in prison. In August 2010, Bermingham and Mulgrew retracted their confessions.|$|E

40|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{downfall}} of the Enron Corporation in 2001 extraordinary attention has been focused on the use of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities</b> (SPEs), structured finance and other methods of managing earnings for the purpose of artificially inflating stock prices of American companies.

25|$|Re-localization of {{manufacturing}} infrastructure by multinational corporations (MNCs) to low-cost countries {{has led to}} de-industrialisation. The reduction of human intervention through automation of production and logistics processes has reduced employment opportunities. Differing taxation regimes within the European Union have led to aggressive tax optimization and avoidance by conglomerates and small and medium-sized enterprises. Favourable commercial tax credit agreements and the rampant misuse of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entity</b> (SPE) based in certain EU28 member States (UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Luxemburg & Belgium) have allowed large corporations to avoid, minimise or indefinitely defer tax dues. Populist movements all over the European Union have campaigned for policies which target loopholes allowing tax avoidance by transnational corporations and scrutinize incentives and subsidies given to factories where automation {{of manufacturing}} processes has improved productivity and enriched share-holders but diminished job prospects for non-specialized workers.

500|$|Enron used {{special purpose}} entities—limited {{partnerships}} or companies created {{to fulfill a}} temporary or specific purpose to fund or manage risks associated with specific assets. The company elected to disclose minimal details on its use of [...] "special purpose entities". These shell companies were created by a sponsor, but funded by independent equity investors and debt financing. For financial reporting purposes, a series of rules dictate whether a <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entity</b> is a separate entity from the sponsor. In total, by 2001, Enron had used hundreds of special purpose entities to hide its debt. Enron used a number of special purpose entities, such as partnerships in its Thomas and Condor tax shelters, financial asset securitization investment trusts (FASITs) in the Apache deal, real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) in the Steele deal, and REMICs and {{real estate investment trusts}} (REITs) in the Cochise deal.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade Mauritius has emerged as an {{international}} financial centre, and has recently attracted global attention. Studies on the architecture of cross-border financial interconnectedness categorize Mauritius as an important node for emerging G 20 countries. In response to a request of the Mauritian Authorities {{to adhere to the}} SDDS data initiative, the IMF recommended that the central bank extend the coverage of the external sector statistics to include the cross-border transactions and positions of <b>Special</b> <b>Purpose</b> <b>Entities</b> (SPEs) in the offshore sector. Results of the 2011 survey of global business corporations holding a category 1 licence (GBC 1 s) domiciled in Mauritius indicate foreign assets holdings of above USD 360 billion. Because GBC 1 s are considered residents of the Mauritian economy for statistical purposes, their foreign debt liabilities have been accounted for as private external debt of the country. However for a small country with a domestic GDP of roughly US$ 12 billion, having such a disproportionate private external debt ratio to GDP distorts its gross external debt indicators and overstates its external vulnerability. These entities, though they do have real activity in Mauritius, are mostly engaged in financial intermediation between non-residents. The paper shares the view that the global statistical standard-setters may have inadequately treated <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>entities</b> (SPEs) and understated their special role in the global financial network.
