40|$|Neglect dyslexia, {{a reading}} {{impairment}} acquired as <b>a</b> consequence <b>of</b> brain injury, is traditionally interpreted as <b>a</b> disturbance <b>of</b> selective attention. Patients with neglect dyslexia may ignore the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> open <b>book,</b> the beginning words <b>of</b> <b>a</b> line <b>of</b> text, or the beginning letters <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single word. These patients provide a rich but sometimes contradictory {{source of data}} regarding the locus of attentional selectivity. We have reconsidered the patient data within the framework <b>of</b> <b>an</b> existing connectionist model of word recognition and spatial attention. We show {{that the effects of}} damage to the model resemble the reading impairments observed in neglect dyslexia. In simulation experiments, we account for <b>a</b> broad spectrum <b>of</b> behaviors including the following: (1) when two noncontiguous stimuli are presented simultaneously, the con-tralesional stimulus is neglected (extinction); (2) explicit instructions to the patient can reduce the severity of neglect; (3) stimulus position in the visual field affects reading performance; (4) words are read much better than pronounceable nonwords; (5) the nature of error responses depends on the morphemic composition of the stimulus; and (6) extinction interacts with lexical knowledge (if two words are presented that form a compound, e. g., cow and BOY, the patient is more likely to report both than in a control condition, e. g., SUN and nu). The convergence of findings from the neuropsychological research and the computational modeling sheds light on the role of attention in normal visuospatial processing, supporting <b>a</b> hybrid view <b>of</b> attentional selection that has properties of both early and late selection.

50|$|Beginning in 1934 Grabhorn {{acquired}} substantial {{knowledge of}} typography and printing through {{working at the}} Grabhorn Press, which was {{owned and operated by}} her husband and his brother Edwin. In 1937 Grabhorn established her own imprint, the Jumbo Press, which she used as a vehicle for experimentation and artistic expression. Named for a toy press, most of the products of the Jumbo Press were pieces of ephemera and displayed Grabhorn's wit and interest in lighthearted feminist satire. Her best known work for the Jumbo Press was the treatise A Typografic Discourse for the Distaff <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> Printing, <b>a</b> <b>Book</b> by Ladies (1937), which was included in the compilation Bookmaking on the Distaff Side, a collaborative feminist work by Grabhorn, Edna Beilenson, Bruce Rogers, and others.

40|$|Fast {{access to}} older theses and {{dissertations}} is still difficult, {{because they are}} often available only in printed form. If in digital form, content of these books could be available more easily. However, scanning <b>of</b> bounded <b>books</b> is <b>a</b> time-consuming and costly process - {{the pages of the}} book must be turned manually. At the Institute for Print and Media Technology, a device was developed, which can turn the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bounded <b>book</b> automatically. While the book is scanned, the operator is free for other tasks, as for example the control and revision of already scanned material and the input of corresponding data records (meta data) into a catalogue system. The presentation gives <b>an</b> overview <b>of</b> the technical functionality, application possibilities and limits <b>of</b> the device. <b>A</b> second main point is the presentation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> draft for the integration of the device into a software based workflow. After the optical character recognition <b>an</b> examination <b>of</b> the scanned pages of the book should be done within this workflow. Missing pages must be recognised, and the operator is informed about these failures. In another step the structure of the book is analysed. Among other things this information can be used to produce an XML-File. Thus the publication and archiving of the thesis as an ETD in online data bases can be supported easily...|$|R
40|$|In 1848 Catherine Crowe wrote The Night <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> Nature <b>a</b> <b>book</b> {{detailing}} ghost sightings {{and experiences}} of hauntings from ordinary people. Crowe suggested that seeing ghosts involved <b>a</b> different type <b>of</b> vision to the accepted one. Outer vision is faulty according to Crowe and she wrote: ‘what we call seeing is merely the function <b>of</b> <b>an</b> organ constructed for that purpose {{in relation to the}} external world: and so limited are its powers, that we are surrounded by many things in that world which we cannot see without the aid of artificial appliances’ (Crowe, 1848 : 27). What might be seen as objective, empirical vision is flawed and there are very many things we cannot see. Crowe believed that ‘In the spirit or soul, or rather in both conjoined, dwells, also, the power of spiritual seeing, or intuitive knowing; for, as there is a spiritual body, there is a spiritual eye’ (26). For Crowe, the rational, objective type of vision most often associated with the masculine and the scientific is not the only one; there is <b>a</b> different sort <b>of</b> vision that is predicated on intuition, experience and involves in-sight. This paper examines Crowe’s ghost stories specifically in relation to the Victorian gender politics of looking and vision. Crowe was deeply critical of the institutions and performances of Victorian masculinity and her ghost tales champion the marginalized – women, the ‘weak’ and animals. Her radical re-view of what can and cannot be seen suggests a collective blindness that can only be banished by an opening up to the wonders and horrors, uncertainties and threats of the unseen. I will argue that Crowe was an important figure in the vanguard of Victorian visual politics; eccentric (mad?) and often ridiculed but insightful and visionary...|$|R
40|$|Price gap, {{defined as}} the {{logarithmic}} price difference between the first two occupied price levels on the same <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> limit order <b>book</b> (LOB), is <b>a</b> key determinant <b>of</b> market depth, {{which is one of}} the dimensions of liquidity. However, the properties of price gaps have not been thoroughly studied due to the less availability of ultrahigh frequency data. In the paper, we rebuild the LOB dynamics based on the order flow data of 26 A-share stocks traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2003. Three key empirical statistical properties of price gaps are investigated. We find that the distribution of price gaps has a power-law tail for all stocks with an average tail exponent close to 3. 2. Applying modern statistical methods, we confirm that the gap time series are long-range correlated and possess multifractal nature. These three features vary from stock to stock and are not universal. Furthermore, we also unveil buy-sell asymmetry phenomena in the properties of price gaps on the buy and sell <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the LOBs for individual stocks. These findings deepen our understanding of the dynamics of liquidity of common stocks and can be used to calibrate agent-based computational financial models. Comment: 13 page...|$|R
5000|$|The India {{phase of}} Juergensmeyer’s {{research}} {{also led to}} three other books. An edited volume, Sikh Studies, included Juergensmeyer’s study of the Ghadar Party, an Indian nationalist movement suffused with religious imagery that was created by expatriate Indians in California in 1915. In this article Juergensmeyer coined the phrase “the Ghadar syndrome” to describe how extreme forms of nationalist pride can emerge from expatriate communities as <b>a</b> way <b>of</b> displacing their sense of marginalization and humiliation as immigrants. This <b>book</b> also included <b>an</b> essay on Sikhism as a [...] "forgotten religion" [...] within the Western view of world religions. Another book, Songs of the Saints <b>of</b> India, <b>a</b> collection <b>of</b> medieval Hindi poetry, was co-translated with John Stratton Hawley. These poems provide religious versions of social protest and reconceptions of the social whole voiced by saints from Indian society’s periphery. <b>A</b> third <b>book,</b> Fighting with Gandhi (later revised and re-issued under the title, Gandhi’s Way), provided a primer on Gandhi's approach to conflict resolution. It shows how Gandhi reconceived the nature <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conflict by looking for solutions that include the truthful aspects <b>of</b> both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dispute.
