MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: A amostra foi constituída por 376 pacientes selecionados em três clínicas de fisioterapia da rede particular, municipal e estadual. Utilizou-se um questionário contendo dados sociodemográficos, de acesso ao serviço e informações relativas à satisfação dos usuários. Foram calculadas médias para variáveis contínuas por meio do teste de Kruskal-Wallis e do teste de Student-Newman-Keuls. RESULTADOS: Os usuários, na sua maioria, eram mulheres (62, 5 %), com uma média de idade de 49, 5 anos (p OBJECTIVE: To evaluate {{user satisfaction}} about Physical Therapy {{services in the}} city of Teresina, State of Piauí, Brazil, and to characterize users' sociodemographic profile and evaluate their satisfaction regarding the time required to <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> <b>appointments</b> and to provide services, reception, trust, ambiance, humanization, accessibility, effectiveness and expectations relating to the services received. METHODS: The sample was comprised of 376 patients who were selected at three physical therapy clinics in the private, municipal and state networks. A questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, access to services and user satisfaction was administered. Averages for continuous variables were compared by means of Kruskal-Wallis and Student-Mewman-Keuls tests. RESULTS: Most of the users were women (62. 5 %), {{with a mean age of}} 49. 5 years. They were married and illiterate, had family income between one and three minimum wages and were dependent on the national health system. They considered that they had easy access to the services. The means of transportation most used was buses, and it took them on average 28. 8 minutes to arrive at the service location. The services users indicated that they did not have any difficulty with the service, but 14 % mentioned that <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> <b>appointments</b> and waiting times were problems they faced in the municipal and state services. Medical indication was the main reason for choosing the service. They trusted the service they received, and the expected treatment results were achieved.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} factors that public school administrators consider when hiring agricultural education teachers. Participants in the study were 24 administrators that hired first year agricultural education teachers in the 2002 - 03 academic year. The collection of data was conducted by phone interviews. The researcher sought 100 % response rate by calling and <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> <b>appointments</b> with the administrators to accompany their tight schedules. Descriptive statistics were used in interpreting the data. Results of Likert-type questions were reported with a mean and standard deviation. Open-ended questions were coded and frequencies were analyzed. Administrators placed the most emphasis on the knowledge of agriculture as measured by a subject matter competency test. Administrators seek well-rounded agricultural instructors who are confident in all areas of the agricultural education setting. They view student project involvement and the supervision of those projects as the most important. Administrators desire candidates who can manage the classroom and who develop rapport with the community. Administrators seek candidates who can orally present their knowledge of agriculture in an enthusiastic manner. Administrators place most value in cooperating teachers ’ recommendations. Administrators prefer candidates who are fully certified as compared to alternatively certified...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{with the}} arrival of {{information}} era and the rapid development of the medical health system, there has been a trend for hospitals and medical care centers to record the patients’ medical record electronically rather than by means of old-fashioned paper-based method. It has indeed reduced the workload of medical workers and it simplifies the procedure within the medical system. It is worth mentioning that the growth of mobile medical care is beginning to catch up {{as a consequence of the}} incredible popularization of mobile networks and the broad use of mobile devices. A significant possibility is that in the coming years, mobile medical care applications will play a large part of the whole electronic medical care system. This project will mainly focus on presenting the process of developing an Android application of doctor’s end in the electronic healthcare system which makes it possible for doctors to retrieve data from their patients and diagnose them as well as <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> <b>appointments</b> using mobile devices. The development for the doctor’s end application will follow the waterfall development methodology. In this report the functions of the doctor’s end application will be introduced, and how these functions are realized will also be displayed in detail. After the implementation, the app will be tested on an Android device emulator and on real Android mobile devices in order to evaluate their performance. In addition, it will be tested by mobile phone specialists in relation to gathering feedback. Finally, a reasonable conclusion will be drawn with regards to this project including ethical issues...|$|E

25|$|PHRs {{have the}} {{potential}} to help analyze an individual’s health profile and identify health threats and improvement opportunities based on an analysis of drug interaction, current best medical practices, gaps in current medical care plans, and identification of medical errors. Patient illnesses can be tracked in conjunction with healthcare providers and early interventions can be promoted upon encountering deviation of health status. PHRs also make it easier for clinicians to care for their patients by facilitating continuous communication as opposed to episodic. Eliminating communication barriers and allowing documentation flow between patients and clinicians in a timely fashion can save time consumed by face-to-face meetings and telephone communication. Improved communication can also ease the process for patients and caregivers to ask questions, to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>appointments,</b> to request refills and referrals, and to report problems. Additionally, {{in the case of an}} emergency a PHR can quickly provide critical information to proper diagnosis or treatment.|$|R

50|$|Social Security {{determines the}} first month of {{potential}} eligibility for SSI by the date of the intent to file an application for benefits as expressed to the Social Security Administration, and an application is filed within 60 days of the date of that expressed intention. To begin the process, people wishing to be considered must contact Social Security (there is a toll-free telephone number) to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a disability interview. No online application for SSI is currently available; however, one may apply for Social Security Disability or Retirement benefits online and add the application for SSI via a telephone-scheduled interview. Calls placed {{on the last day of}} the month, where the interview is scheduled for the second week of the following month, will result in SSI eligibility being retroactive to the month in which the call was made to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> the <b>appointment,</b> although the first check will not be received until the next month. For example, a person calls on 31 January to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> an <b>appointment</b> for February.

50|$|Born to a Jewish family, Tuchman worked various {{jobs as a}} teenager: in a surf {{shop and}} renting lots for car sales which blossomed into a {{business}} where he would answer inquiries and then <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>appointments.</b> In the 1980s, Tuchman worked for his father's luxury-home construction business in California.

In 1982, he founded Teletech in an old nursery school near Los Angeles allowing businesses to outsource their customer service requirements. His first big customer was Herbalife. In 1984, after the conglomerate AT&T was broken up, TeleTech was hired to monitor AT&T’s transactions with customers who were switching carriers which led to business with two of the resulting phone companies, MCI, Inc. and United Telecom (now Sprint Corporation), to sign up new customers.|$|R

This is particularly true for patients fighting addictions. Choices! Counseling Services has commissioned an app to help patients recovering from addictions to handle appointments, control symptoms, and find support when needed. Our team, through the Computing and Information Sciences Department of Valparaiso University, and in collaboration with Paula Dranger, {{assistant director of the}} Valparaiso University SAAFE Office, has created a proof of concept and initial implementation for a support tool for those dealing with chemical dependency issues. The software was created using the Ionic 2 Framework and the Firebase real-time database to simplify multi-platform and multi-device support. The suite includes two separate applications: an app for patients receiving treatment, and a backend interface for caregiver staff. Features for patients include viewing a calendar with meetings and important dates, logging when they feel triggered by their addictions, viewing a list of contacts to receive help, and tracking short and long term goals. Caregivers using the accompanying administrative app can configure the patients’ apps, <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>appointments,</b> and track patients’ progress. Caregivers will be notified if a patient feels triggered and needs help. This is made possible by the shared database between the apps.
