5|$|HSP is a <b>systemic</b> <b>vasculitis</b> (inflammation {{of blood}} vessels) and is {{characterized}} by deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children it usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults the prognosis is different than in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. And for many {{it tends to be}} relapsing-remitting {{over a long period of}} time rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications.|$|E

25|$|Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic {{antibodies}} (ANCAs) are a {{group of}} autoantibodies, mainly of the IgG type, against antigens in the cytoplasm of neutrophil granulocytes (the {{most common type of}} white blood cell) and monocytes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic {{antibodies}} (ANCA) {{have been}} used as a diagnostic marker for <b>systemic</b> necrotising <b>vasculitis,</b> a disease classification which includes Wegener granulomatosis, microscopic and classic polyarteritis nodosa, and Churg Strauss disease. OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic value of the two methods for detecting these antibodies [...] immunofluorescence and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [...] with respect to biopsy proven active <b>systemic</b> necrotising <b>vasculitis</b> in a clinically relevant population. METHODS: A prospective study to ascertain the patient's diagnosis at the time of each of the 466 requests for ANCA received at one laboratory over a nine month period, and allocate each to one of five diagnostic groups: active and inactive biopsy proven <b>systemic</b> necrotising <b>vasculitis,</b> suspected <b>systemic</b> necrotising <b>vasculitis,</b> low probability <b>systemic</b> necrotising <b>vasculitis,</b> and not <b>systemic</b> necrotising <b>vasculitis.</b> RESULTS: ELISA was superior to immunofluorescence in the diagnosis of <b>systemic</b> necrotising <b>vasculitis</b> because it was less likely to detect other diseases. This was reflected in its specificity of 97 % and positive predictive value of 73 %, compared with 90 % and only 50 % for immunofluorescence (p = 0. 0006 and p = 0. 013, respectively). ELISA had a negative predictive value of 98 % which was not significantly different to immunofluorescence. ELISA was technically superior. CONCLUSIONS: ELISA is the superior method of ANCA detection in the diagnosis of <b>systemic</b> necrotising <b>vasculitis</b> and should be used in conjunction with a compatible clinical picture and histological evidence...|$|R

25|$|Inflammation, or {{vasculitis}} of {{the arteries}} and veins occurs throughout the body. This is usually caused by increased production of {{the cells of the}} immune system to a pathogen, or autoimmunity. Systemic vasculitides may be classified according to the type of cells involved in the proliferation, as well as the specific type of tissue damage occurring within the vein or arterial walls. Under this classification scheme for <b>systemic</b> <b>vasculitis,</b> Kawasaki disease {{is considered to be a}} necrotizing vasculitis (also called necrotizing angiitis), which may be identified histologically by the occurrence of necrosis (tissue death), fibrosis, and proliferation of cells associated with inflammation in the inner layer of the vascular wall.|$|E
25|$|ANCAs are {{associated}} with small vessel vasculitides including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis, primary pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (a type of renal-limited microscopic polyangiitis), {{eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis}} (previously known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) and drug induced vasculitides. PR3 directed c-ANCA is present in 80-90% of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, 20-40% of microscopic polyangiitis, 20-40% of pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis and 35% of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. c-ANCA (atypical) is present in 80% of cystic fibrosis (with BPI as the target antigen) and also in inflammatory bowel disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis and rheumatoid arthritis (with antibodies to multiple antigenic targets). p-ANCA with MPO specificity is found in 50% of microscopic polyangiitis, 50% of primary pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis and 35% of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. p-ANCA with specificity to other antigens {{are associated}} with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, drug-induced vasculitis, autoimmune liver disease, drug induced syndromes and parasitic infections. Atypical ANCA is associated with drug-induced <b>systemic</b> <b>vasculitis,</b> inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{pathogenesis}} of hypertension in two patients with hepatitis-B surface antigen-positive <b>systemic</b> necrotizing <b>vasculitis.</b> Both presented with hypertension, hypokalemia, and renal potassium wasting. Plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone levels were markedly elevated. Renal arteriograms showed widespread microaneurysms, and necrotizing vasculitis involving renal arteries was confirmed histologically. Hypertension was refractory to conventional treatment in both patients. In one patient, hypertension was easily controlled with the angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril.

40|$|Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies with {{specificity}} for myeloperoxidase (MPO) {{were found}} in 53 patient sera that were routinely submitted for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody determination. Based on clinical and histologic criteria, 15 of these 53 patients were classified as having <b>systemic</b> necrotizing <b>vasculitis</b> of the polyarteritis group, 11 patients were classified as having Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), and 14 were classified as having idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis. The remaining 13 patients did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for these disorders, although most of these patients had clinical symptoms compatible with these disorders. While all patients with WG had renal involvement, only 4 of the 15 patients with <b>systemic</b> necrotizing <b>vasculitis</b> of the polyarteritis group had glomerulonephritis. The sensitivity of autoantibodies to MPO for either <b>systemic</b> necrotizing <b>vasculitis</b> of the polyarteritis group, WG, or idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis was further tested in all our patients with these disorders (n = 104). Twenty-seven of 104 patients had autoantibodies to MPO. Furthermore, 69 of the remaining 77 patients had autoantibodies specific for the 29 -kd serine protease, which {{has been reported to}} be specifically associated with WG. Sera from 8 patients were negative for either of these antibodies (92 % sensitivity of autoantibodies to MPO and/or the 29 -kd serine protease). The specificity of autoantibodies to MPO for either <b>systemic</b> necrotizing <b>vasculitis</b> of the polyarteritis group, WG, or idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis was also tested in selected groups of patients who had closely related diseases. Two of 144 patients had autoantibodies to MPO (specificity 99 %). We conclude that these antibodies are not only associated with idiopathic and vasculitis-associated crescentic glomerulonephritis, but also with classic polyarteritis nodosa, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and the polyangiitis overlap syndrome without renal involvement. The presence of autoantibodies to MPO or the 29 -kd serine protease is highly sensitive and specific for <b>systemic</b> necrotizing <b>vasculitis</b> of the polyarteritis group, WG, and idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis...|$|R
