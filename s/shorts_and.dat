5|$|The French team {{traditionally}} {{played in}} blue shirts, white <b>shorts,</b> <b>and</b> red socks, {{the colors of}} the national flag, and as such were nicknamed les tricolores. Due to the mostly blue strip the French team currently wears, the team is now often referred to as les Bleus (the Blues), like many other French sporting teams. When this strip clashes with that of their opponents, such as in games against Scotland and Italy, French players wear white. New strips were developed for the 2007 World Cup, one of which is a darker blue. In June 2011 they relaunched another kit which they wear blue shirt, blue <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> blue socks for their home kit and they wear white shirt, white <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> white socks for their away kit.|$|E

5|$|As both Manchester United and Bayern Munich {{traditionally}} wore red {{as their}} primary kit colour, UEFA regulations would normally have required both teams to wear their change kits. However, the two clubs felt {{it would have been}} a shame for neither to wear their traditional colours, and they agreed to toss a coin to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red shirts, white <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> white socks, while Bayern wore silver shirts, <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> socks, all with maroon trim.|$|E

3000|$|Finally, Regularity {{represents}} {{the level of}} the similarity of the customers’ diversity and loyalty scores over <b>shorter</b> <b>and</b> longer terms. In principle, it is one-complement of the mean Euclidean distances between <b>shorter</b> <b>and</b> longer term score vectors for diversity and loyalty. Regularity is calculated as R_i = 1 - √((([...] D_i^S - D_i^L [...])^ 2 + ([...] L_i^S - L_i^L [...])^ 2) / 2), where D_i^S and D_i^L stand for <b>shorter</b> <b>and</b> longer term diversity, respectively. Likewise, L_i^S and L_i^L stand for <b>shorter</b> <b>and</b> longer term loyalty. Regularity scores closer to 1 represent higher regularity indicating having similar diversity and loyalty scores in <b>shorter</b> <b>and</b> longer term periods. For our study, the duration of the shorter term is selected as the one third of the observation window (Please see Table  1 for the observation windows.).|$|R

5|$|F.C. United's club colours are red, {{white and}} black—the same colours worn by Manchester United. The shirt bears no {{sponsorship}} logo, {{as it was}} written into the club's constitution that the club should not have a shirt sponsor. The club's first kit was a plain red shirt, white <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> plain black socks. The club introduced a new home shirt for the 2007–08 season with a striped collar and striped ends on the sleeves which lasted until 2009. This was changed for the 2009–11 seasons to a red shirt with {{a black and white}} stripe down the left side, manufactured by Admiral Sportswear. For seasons 2011–13 the club reverted to a plain red shirt, manufactured by O'Neills. The club's second kit, worn when playing away against a team with a predominantly red kit, is a white shirt with a horizontal red and black wave, white <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> socks. The club has an alternative plain blue kit for playing against a team with a red and white kit. In past seasons white shirts with diagonal black or red stripes and a white shirt with a red trim, black <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> white socks have all been used as the second kits.|$|E
5|$|France {{traditionally}} play in blue {{shirts with}} white <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> red socks, and are {{commonly referred to}} as les tricolores or les bleus. The French emblem is a golden rooster imposed upon a red shield. Their alternative strip is composed of a white shirt and navy blue <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> socks. French international matches are played at several venues across the country; the Stade de France in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis is used for their games during the Six Nations, and they have a formidable home record at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille where they have only lost twice, to Argentina in 2004 and to New Zealand in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The club's home kit {{has always}} {{consisted}} of a black-and-white vertically striped shirt, with black <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> white or black socks. The width of {{the black and white}} stripes has varied from season to season, as has the colour of the shirt numbers, which have usually been red, black, white or yellow. Atlético's traditional away kit is all-white shirts, <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> socks, but has had slight variations. An all-black third kit was introduced in the 2000 season, being used again in 2015. In 2008, a black-and-gold vertically striped third kit was launched to commemorate the club's centenary, featuring the first crest. Squad number 12 is retired from the club's kits, dedicated to the fans.|$|E

5|$|Tow Law Town's home colours have {{traditionally}} been vertical black and white stripes with black <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> socks. This is common amongst clubs in the North East of England; Football League Championship club Newcastle United play in black and white, but locally Spennymoor Town, Darlington, Ponteland United and Ashington also wear black and white kits. Tow Law Town's away strips consist of blue and red halves with blue <b>shorts</b> <b>and</b> socks. Between 2006 and 2009, the club were sponsored by McInerney Homes, in a £5,000 a year deal. In August 2010, local company Bodywork Direct took over the club shirt sponsorship deal.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{problems}} about Chinese bridges with <b>short</b> <b>and</b> medium span recent years were analyzed in this paper. The necessity and feasibility of modern timber structure applied in <b>short</b> <b>and</b> medium span bridges in China were also put forward. The {{results showed that}} the <b>short</b> <b>and</b> medium span bridges had many problems, such as monotonous structural forms, serious environmental pollution, multiple bridge defects and difficulty in maintenance. With the development of connection and maintenance technology of modern timber structure and its advantages of light self-weight, environmental coordination, high carrying capacity, excellent durability and abundant structural forms, it was necessary and feasible to apply modern timber structure in <b>short</b> <b>and</b> medium span bridges in China. More emphasis on the construction of modern timber structure should be conducted to expand its application scopes and improve the construction proportion of <b>short</b> <b>and</b> medium span timber bridges...|$|R
