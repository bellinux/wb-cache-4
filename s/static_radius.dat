40|$|Current-carrying string loop {{dynamics}} in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes {{characterized by the}} cosmological parameter λ= 1 / 3 ΛM^ 2 is investigated. With attention concentrated to the axisymmetric motion of string loops it is shown that the resulting motion is governed {{by the presence of}} an outer tension barrier and an inner angular momentum barrier that are influenced by the black hole gravitational field given by the mass M and the cosmic repulsion given by the cosmological constant Λ. The gravitational attraction could cause capturing of the string having low energy by the black hole or trapping in its vicinity; with high enough energy, the string can escape (scatter) to infinity. The role of the cosmic repulsion becomes important in vicinity of the so-called <b>static</b> <b>radius</b> where the gravitational attraction is balanced by the cosmic repulsion-it is demonstrated both in terms of the effective potential of the string motion and the basin boundary method reflecting its chaotic character, that a potential barrier exists along the <b>static</b> <b>radius</b> behind which no trapped oscillations may exist.

40|$|Static light {{scattering}} (SLS) and dynamic {{light scattering}} (DLS) techniques {{are used to}} measure characteristics of particles in dispersion. SLS measures the dependence of the average scattered intensity I, on the scattering angle and is sensitive to spatial variations in the dielectric constant E. DLS measures the time dependence of the scattered light. One fundamental application of light scattering techniques is the accurate measurement of the size distribution of particles in dispersion. Detailed experimental investigation of SLS and DLS has been attempted in this work, with experimental work based on dilute water dispersions of two different spherical particles, polystyrene latexes and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels.

With the method, a new size, static radii R_s, can be measured. Based on the new static particle size information, detailed investigation of the normalized time auto-correlation function of the scattered light intensity g^(2) (τ) reveals that there exist three different particle sizes: the <b>static</b> <b>radius,</b> hydrodynamic radius and apparent hydrodynamic radius that is the hydrodynamic radius obtained using the cumulants method.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} pattern of the onset of {{complete}} absorption (the black limit) in the high energy hadron-hadron collisions. The black limit arises due to the hard and soft interaction dynamics {{as a function of the}} impact parameters b. Both hard and soft mechanisms provide universal dependence of the partial amplitude of the high energy elastic hadron- hadron scattering on the impact parameter b and result in the radius of interaction proportional to (s/s_ 0). We find that with increase of the collision energies hard interactions lead to a faster increase of the impact parameter range where the partial wave amplitudes are approaching the unitarity limit. Consequently, we argue that at super high energies whenthe radius of hadronic interactions significantly exceeds <b>static</b> <b>radii</b> of the interacting hadrons(nuclei) the ratio of total cross sections of nucleon-nucleon, meson-nucleon, hadron-nucleus, nucleus-nucleus collisions becomes equal to one.

Lifting body hypersonic vehicle aerodynamic data is obtained by high-accuracy CFD code which copyright by CAAA. We adopted feedback linearization control theory, pitching angle holding control laws in order to keep maximum lift-drag ratio glider, the six degree of freedom (DOF) simulation validate the control law. The simulation results show some hypersonic flight characteristics, including <b>static</b> unstable, earth <b>radius</b> and rotationeffects and high-coupledcharacteristics. The simulation model and results provide a useful reference for a hypersonic vehicle's dynamics analysis, control law design and overall design...|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} {{method is}} proposed to generate configurations of coarse grained models for polymer melts. This method, largely inspired by chemical ``radical polymerization'', is divided in three stages: (i) nucleation of radicals (reacting molecules caching monomers); (ii) growth of chains within a solvent of monomers; (iii) termination: annihilation of radicals and removal of residual monomers. The main interest {{of this method}} is that relaxation is performed as chains are generated. Pure mono and poly-disperse polymers melts are generated and compared to the configurations generated by the Push Off method from Auhl et al [...] A detailed study of the <b>static</b> properties (gyration <b>radius,</b> mean square internal distance, entanglement length) confirms that the radical-like polymerization technics is suitable to generate equilibrated melts. The method is flexible, and {{can be adapted to}} generate nano-structured polymers, namely diblock and triblock copolymers. Comment: 9 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
