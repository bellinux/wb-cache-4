We showed that anticipating <b>seed</b> <b>cutting</b> can accelerate the progression of the stands towards more adult stand conditions, compared with traditional management. The application of different active management options in the same landscape can contribute to increase landscape diversity. ContextIn southern European beech forests, coppice is a widespread management system, especially due to the past uses. The existence of large areas either abandoned or under protracted transitory stage raises questions concerning environmental and economic revenues related to the different management options. AimsWe evaluated the effectiveness of anticipating <b>seed</b> <b>cutting</b> in beech coppices to accelerate the coppice transition to high forest, compared with traditional management (periodic thinning) and natural evolution pattern (unthinned control). MethodsWe used an exploratory analysis of ecological variables related to structure, dynamics, and productivity of the stands (growth efficiency, leaf area index, litter production, transmittance, and canopy heterogeneity), which were monitored during 10  years in beech coppices in Central Italy. ResultsAnticipating <b>seed</b> <b>cutting</b> produced stronger modification in canopy structure, improving growth efficiency {{as a result of}} higher resource availability, supporting higher seed production which accelerated the progression of the stand towards more adult stand conditions, compared with traditional management and unthinned control.

40|$|European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in Italy where it covers 1035103 ha, mainly {{concentrated in the}} mountainous areas at altitudes above 900 m. The major part is represented by high forest often issued from the conversion of coppice woods, which in the past was the silvicultural system most widely applied mainly to provide fire wood. The social changes occurred {{in the second half}} of the last century –fire wood market crisis and the increasing importance of environmental issues- enhanced the conversion into high forest of large areas previously managed as coppice by means of different silvicultural treatments and practices. Nevertheless, the environmental benefits of this choice were not adequately investigated. Results of annual measurements (1992 - 2009) made in a beech coppice stand aged 65 are here reported. The study area is located on the Alpe di Catenaia, a pre-Apennine outcrop close to Arezzo (Central Italy). Variables strictly related to stand productivity and dynamics such as annual litter and seed production, leaf area index (LAI) and transmittance (PAR) were measured in the research area of Buca Zamponi to estimate the effects of two theses, natural evolution (TEST) and conversion into high forest (DIR). Three thinnings were undertaken in the latter thesis in 1972, 1987 and 2002. Additional theses of natural evolution (CONTR) and advance <b>seed</b> <b>cutting</b> (TS) were added in 2002 in a nearby study area (Eremo della Casella). Results showed the high productivity of coppice stands, under conversion to high forest, with mean values of annual total litter, leaf litter and leaf area index of 5 Mg ha- 1, 3 Mg ha- 1 and 6 m 2 m- 2, respectively. These findings confirm both the prompt response of beech to intensive thinning cycles and the reliability of undertaking coppice conversion into high forest. Furthermore, the positive trend observed in the ecological parameters and the high consistency of leaf fraction, highlight the still juvenile phase in progress in these stands. These results will be investigated further because of their significance in stands aged over 60. The applied silviculture produced positive outcomes in all the tested theses. Annual total litter, leaf area index and transmittance showed significant differences comparing DIR and TEST.

Experiments in <b>seed,</b> <b>cutting,</b> grafting, and tissue culture propagation were undertaken to perpetuate this desired spineless phenotype. Germination percentages for mechanically scarified seeds ranged from 33 % to 94 %, however yield of spineless seedlings was low (0 to 34 %). Sulfuric acid scarification for 10, 20, 30, or 60 minutes hastened and unified germination compared to non-treated seeds by seven to eight days. Vegetative propagation was successful for softwood cuttings. Rooting measures increased with auxin concentration from 0 to 15000 mg? L??, with maximum rooting percentage, root number, and root length per softwood cutting of 70 %, 9. 2 roots, and 12. 4 cm, respectively, at 15000 mg? L?? auxin eight weeks after treatment. Rooting was not successful for semi-hardwood and hardwood cuttings. Whip-and-tongue and T-bud grafting were not successful with the treatments used, likely due to accumulation of phenolic compounds and inexperience in these techniques. Tissue culture of shoots from in vitro germinated seedlings indicated that shoot proliferation was greater in Murishige and Skoog (MS) medium with 15 to 20 [u]M zeatin in the first experiment. Shoot proliferation was greater on Woody Plant Medium with 20 [u]M benzyladenine in the second experiment. A weeping phenotype of Ulmus parvifolia Jacq. was identified with aesthetic landscape value. Cuttings at different growth stages using varied concentrations of a rooting hormone were compared to determine the most efficient method to perpetuate this desired phenotype.

40|$|Normal 0 14 false false false MicrosoftInternetExplorer 4 Aim of {{the work}} is to provide further {{knowledge}} on the silvicultural system applied to Quercus cerris hight forests in the Molise Region (Central Italy). An historical analysis, based on a number of forest management plans applied since 1940 referred to 19 municipalities and on other historical documents, is provided in the paper. Forest management has been traditionally applied in the Molise Region and therefore is at now possible to reconstruct in detail the management of the forests of Molise Region. The historical study has been integrated with the analysis of a chronosequence including four steps of stand development in a Turkey oak stand: the regeneration phase (1 - 2 yrs) - the unthinned young stand (46 yrs) - the unthinned adult stand (aged 60 to 100) - the mature stand (126 yrs). Mensurational surveys were carried out at each phase in order to characterize both stand structure and derive information on the silvicultural practices applied in the past, but not documented in the available papers. The stand age was determined by tree coring and count of annual rings. At the beginning of the last century, the silvicultural system to be applied in oak high forests wasn’t strictly defined and a particular kind of selection cutting was carried out. It was named taglio a salto per sezioni i. e. “compartment selection cutting”, partly leading back to a real selection cutting, partly to a shelterwood system. The use of the reported silvicultural system gave rise to irregular forest structures and led to management problems well-described in the management plans at the end of 1940 s. Another consequence of the applied practices was the absence or the inadequate natural regeneration establishment. The contemporary unregulated practice of grazing the forest floor contributed to the unsuccessful regeneration and made the situation worse. The presence of an understorey layer made up by sproutings from Carpinus betulus stools clearcutting, was a further hindrance to the establishment of natural oak regeneration. In the fifties, the rate of forest management increased {{as a consequence of the}} coming up economic concern in sleeper production. The silvicultural shelterwood system was therefore codified. The system resulted to be more effective and adopted up to the present time. The traditional shelterwood system was based on a 90 yrs rotation length, three thinnings performed from the age of 25 up to 75, time of the <b>seed</b> <b>cutting</b> with a release of 90 trees per hectare. In the seventies, following the much more reduced and even null concern in wood production from oak high forests, practices into the same forests were suspended or postponed. At now, the renewed concern for fuelwood production, the only assortment marketable, as well as the increased attention paid to the multifunctional role of these forests, made again actual the problem of oak high forest management. The effectiveness of shelterwood system is the main outcome of the documental analysis performed. The study of the Carovilli’s chronosequence confirmed the close link between the current stand structures and the prescribed rules adopted in the past, in accordance with the management plans. The experimental trials in progress are now focused at defining an improvement of the shelterwood system practice as for the following issues: reduction of cutting areas; establishment of a more complex structural mosaic at neighbouring forest patches, setting up of a consistent release of seed trees i. e. number and dendrotypes to be selected at the purpose, with a special care to the crown cover to the forest floor, effective control of the understorey development due to the resprouting of Carpinus betulus stools, to enhance the establishment of oak natural regeneration. st 1 behavior:url(#ieooui) /* Style Definitions */ table.

40|$|La gestione forestale sostenibile (GFS) è attualmente riconosciuta come lo strumento {{principale}} per il mantenimento del ruolo delle foreste quali regolatrici del sistema climatico, le quali contengono circa il 46 % del carbonio organico terrestre sottoforma di biomassa arborea (359 Gt C) e nei suoli (787 Gt C) (WBGU, 1998). In Europa, il quadro di riferimento comune per verificare la sostenibilità della gestione delle foreste sono le Linee guida operative pan-europee, adottate durante la Seconda Conferenza Ministeriale sulla Protezione delle Foreste in Europa (MCPFE), tenutasi ad Helsinki nel 1993. Il presente lavoro si è posto l’obiettivo di valutare i cambiamenti che la gestione opera su un popolamento forestale e in particolare di stimare le dinamiche legate al ciclo del carbonio in una fustaia di cerro dell’Azienda Speciale del Demanio Forestale di Stato di La Torre di Feudozzo (AQ), in Abruzzo. Nel sito è presente un bosco di Quercus cerris L. che a partire dagli anni ’ 90 è stato sottoposto ai diradamenti e ai tagli di sementazione su più superfici. Questo ha portato alla formazione di quattro popolamenti diversificati, assimilabili ad una cronosequenza, di cui tre si trovano, rispettivamente, a 1 (08), 3 (06) e 12 (97) anni dal taglio di sementazione mentre uno è costituito da una fustaia transitoria a circa 40 anni dall’intervento di conversione, non ancoratrattata (70). Per ricostruire la storia della gestione del sito è stata svolta un’analisi su documenti cartacei e geografici in ambito GIS, che ha permesso di risalire agli eventi di gestione che hanno interessato la foresta negli ultimi 80 anni. Tali informazioni sono state derivate soprattutto dai due Piani di Assestamento redatti per conto dell’Azienda di Stato proprietaria della foresta fin dall’inizio del 1900. Le informazioni ottenute sono state successivamente riscontrate nei risultati dell’analisi dendrologica delle quattro particelle. Nel complesso, il taglio di sementazione ha portato, in media, ad una diminuzione del 50 % dello stock di biomassa epigea con una semplificazione strutturale del popolamento. Lo stock totale, inteso come la somma dei cinque stock previsti dall’IPCC (1997), è risultato maggiore nella particella non tagliata con 370. 8 tC ha- 1 a differenza delle tagliate dove varia, invece, da 256. 6 a 270. 8 tC ha- 1. In seguito al taglio è stato osservato, inoltre, una diminuzione dello stock di lettiera, 0. 4 tC ha- 1 nella 08 in confronto a 1. 2 tC ha- 1 della 70, ed un aumento della necromassa grossa e fine,rilasciata con le operazioni di esbosco (circa 10 tC ha- 1). Il contenuto di azoto del suolo risulta inferiore nella particella a 12 anni dal taglio con 10. 7 tN ha- 1, rispetto alle 17. 6 tN ha- 1 della particella non tagliata. Questo è dovuto probabilmente alla diversa e più intensa gestione che è stata realizzata in questa parte della cerreta. Sustainable {{forest management}} (SFM) {{has been recognized}} as the main instrument to preserve the role of forests as regulators of the global climate dynamics, since 46 % of terrestrial organic carbon is stored in the aboveground biomass (359 Gt C) and forest soils (787 Gt C) (WBGU, 1998). In Europe, the common framework to control and promote the SFM are the Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management as agreed by the Second Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe (MCPFE), held in Helsinki in 1993. In this study, the influence of forest management on the carbon cycle was investigated in a Turkey oak forest (Quercus cerris L.) in Abruzzo,. The study site is made up by a chronosequence consisting of four stands at different age after cut. Three stands are respectively 2 (08), 3 (06) and 12 (97) years after the shelterwood cut and one (70) has never been logged since the ’ 40 s. To better understand the management history of the site, we traced the events that have affected the forest over the past 80 years from the previous forest management plans {{as well as from}} a GIS analysis in the last 13 years. The information obtained was subsequently confirmed by the results of the dendrological analysis performed for the four stands. The harvest removed about 50 % of aboveground biomass which led to a simplification of the forest structure. Total carbon stock, defined as the sum of the five stocks defined by the IPCC (1997), was higher in the unmanaged stand with 370. 8 tC ha- 1, while the stock in the cut stands varied from 256. 6 to 270. 8 tC ha- 1. After harvesting, we observed a decrease in litter stock (0. 4 tC ha- 1 of stand 08 compared to 1. 2 tC ha- 1 of stand 70) and an increase in coarse and fine deadwood derived from harvesting residues (about 10 tC ha- 1). Soil nitrogen content was lower in the stand 12 years after harvesting with about 10. 7 tN ha- 1, respect to the untreated stand with 17. 6 tN ha- 1. This is probably due to different and more intensive management that was carried out {{in this part of the}} forest. After <b>seed</b> <b>cutting,</b> the reduced competition and the increased availability of resources for the remaining trees resulted in an expansion of crowns (LAI increase) and in an increasing of the Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) of 3 tC ha- 1 year- 1 for stand 06 compared to 2. 4 tC ha- 1 year- 1 for stand 70. The removal of canopy implied higher mean air and soil temperatures (Ts) during the growing season with greater temperatures fluctuations between day and night. Moreover gaps in the managed forest cover induced rapid increases of the soil water content (SWC) after precipitations but, at the same time, larger evaporations during the warm days. Effects of the microclimate and biomass variations were observed on soil respiration (RS) starting from three years after cutting. 11 Annual estimates of soil respiration and its temperature dependence in all stands were determined fitting data to Q 10 and Gamma model (Khomik et al., 2009). Gamma model had the ability to take on logistical shapes and to fit the RS data better compared to the exponential Q 10 at high Ts and low SWC values. In 2009, the total annual soil C emission estimated was higher in the 06 stand with 1937. 1 gC m- 2 year- 1, followed by 97 (1645. 7 gC m- 2 year- 1) and 08 (1488. 1 gC m- 2 year- 1). The trend of the latter was similar to the 70 (1496 gC m- 2 year- 1). In addition, annual soil respiration was used to estimate the total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA) in the unmanaged stand where the assumption of a steady state condition with respect to total soil carbon storage was reasonable. Finally, we installed an eddy covariance (EC) mobile system to measure the net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Use of mobile EC system allowed a comparison of ecosystems with respect to the spatial patterns of management that generated a strong heterogeneity in surface. Furthermore, the chronosequence approach to studying vegetation dynamics with space-for-time substitution provided a significant insight into the patterns and mechanisms of stand carbon dynamics. During the first sampling period, from 30 April 2009 to August 14, the EC system was placed between the 97 and 06 stands, then, since August 14 we moved it at the boundary between the more recently cut stands (06 and 08) and the uncut one (70). Given the heterogeneity of the studied forest, we needed to precisely calculate the footprint contributions of specific surface areas around the mobile EC system. The analytical method proposed by Nefetl et al. (2008) provided a tool for calculating the source area after the Kormann and Meixner footprint equation (2001) combining the field measurements with a landuse information. It allowed us to discriminate all those cases in which the fluxes source area was spreaded over two different stands, especially during the second sampling period when the mobile EC System was placed in the middle of three different stands. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) estimated over the sampling period ranged from - 29 to + 9 molCO 2 m- 2 s- 1 in the stand 97 and from - 20 to + 15 molCO 2 m- 2 s- 1 in the 06. Over the second period NEE ranged from - 14 to + 9 molCO 2 m- 2 s- 1 in stand 08 and from - 14 to + 20 molCO 2 m- 2 s- 1 in stand 70. Respiration was slightly higher in the uncut stand, in relation to higher stand biomass and, at the same time, the approaching of the last part of the growing season. Cumulated net ecosystem exchange (NEE) for the period when single stands were measured, was - 307 gC m- 2 (GPP - 461. 6 gC m- 2, Re 154. 5 gC m- 2) in stand 97 and - 126. 3 gC m- 2 (GPP - 502. 3 gC m- 2, Re 376 gC m- 2) in stand 06, while for the second period cumulated NEE was - 89. 4 gC m- 2 (GPP - 186. 4 gC m- 2, Re 97 gC m- 2) in stand 08 and 20. 2 gC m- 2 (GPP - 359 gC m- 2, Re 379. 8 gC m- 2) for stand 70. 12 For the observed period, the site was estimated to be a carbon sink, with the exception of the unmanaged forest that, differently from the other stands, were measured until end of season (October). Anyhow, the annual carbon balance can be assessed after a full year of sampling including also the winter season. The multi-methodological approach to the study of carbon cycle has allowed to investigate the various factors that differently affect the dynamics of the ecosystem. In this study, the integration of multiple methods, such as structural analysis, forest inventories, fluxes and micrometeorological measurements allowed to relate the different aspects of the carbon cycle with the factors, mainly climatic and structural, that influenced the dynamics after management operations and along time. These tools, when individually applied, are not able to describe in the same way the complexity of the forest response to the modified ecological conditions after management. Understanding the effects of harvest on the carbon balance and its temporal dynamics is necessary for implementing sustainable forest management. Dottorato di ricerca in Ecologia forestal...|$|E
