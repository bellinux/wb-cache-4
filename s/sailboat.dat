5|$|September 26, 1992– Tropical Storm Danielle moves inland {{over the}} Delmarva Peninsula, causing up to 3inches (8cm) of rain along the coast. The storm also causes {{moderate}} tidal flooding {{of up to}} 7.2feet in Atlantic City and minor beach erosion. Strong waves {{off the coast of}} New Jersey sank a <b>sailboat,</b> causing the death of its driver.|$|E
5|$|The {{subtropical}} storm postponed the bi-annual Newport, Rhode Island to Bermuda <b>sailboat</b> {{race for}} two consecutive days {{due to the}} forecast one of the storm. Subsequent reports from sailboats said that with the track of the storm, {{if not for the}} delay, {{there would have been a}} marine disaster.|$|E
50|$|Typical length-to-beam {{ratios for}} small <b>sailboats</b> are from 2:1 (dinghies to trailerable <b>sailboats</b> around 20 ft) to 5:1 (racing <b>sailboats</b> over 30 ft).|$|R

5|$|Tropical Storm Danielle dropped light {{rainfall}} {{across much}} of New Jersey, with some areas in the southwestern portion of the state experiencing over 3inches (76mm). Strong waves from the storm washed out miles of beaches along the coastline. In Ocean City, the waves passed over the boardwalk and into houses. Further north, the waves crashed a four-person, 35-foot (10-m) <b>sailboat</b> near Island Beach State Park. Two managed to swim safely to shore, though the other two occupants drowned.|$|E
5|$|West of Haiti, the {{hurricane}} brought hurricane-force winds to Cuba. A fisherman {{on the eastern}} tip of Cuba was killed by rough seas while trying to secure his boats. Since {{the hurricane}} passed largely east of the Bahamas, only minor damage was reported there. Hazel passed directly over Inagua, where it claimed six lives when a <b>sailboat</b> capsized while taking shelter from the storm.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, Frances began tracking over cooler SST's, which gradually {{weakened the}} storm. The eye featured became indistinct and by late on October 25, Frances was downgraded to a tropical storm. Over {{the next two}} days, Frances began losing tropical characteristics, and was declared extratropical by early on October 27. One sailor was reported missing, however, it is unknown if it was {{as a result of}} Frances. In addition, one person on a <b>sailboat</b> suffered injuries during an encounter with Frances. On land, Frances caused minimal impact, limited to light rainfall across Newfoundland.|$|E
50|$|The Ports of Santa Lucia were {{during the}} 1960 Summer Olympics the Olympic harbors of the Dragon <b>sailboats</b> (quays of Borgo Marinari), Star and 5.5 Metre (quays of Molosiglio). Finn and Flying Dutchman <b>sailboats</b> were instead housed in Mergellina. HRH Crown Prince Constantine won the Gold {{medal in the}} event of Dragon <b>sailboats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sailboats</b> can {{be pushed}} {{downwind}} by the wind, or can use lift to move across {{or into the}} wind. [...] However, for most <b>sailboats</b> the boat speed drops if sailing closer than 45 degrees to the wind. [...] The highest speed for most <b>sailboats</b> is reaching with the wind from the side or the aft quarter (a beam reach or a broad reach).|$|R

5|$|An {{abandoned}} <b>sailboat</b> drifts into New York Harbor and is boarded by harbor patrol officers. One {{is killed}} by a zombie, which falls overboard after being shot by another officer. The police question the boat owner's daughter, Anne Bowles (Tisa Farrow), who claims she hasn't seen her father for months. At the morgue, the officer's corpse stirs. Anne meets journalist Peter West (Ian McCulloch), and the pair follows her father's trail to the Caribbean island Matul. En route, they befriend Brian Hull (Al Cliver) and Susan Barrett (Auretta Gay), who are sailing around the area and agree {{to take them to}} Matul.|$|E
5|$|If {{one game}} is played as a sequel to the other by a linked password, Twinrova captures Princess Zelda, {{lighting}} the Flame of Despair. Link enters a warp point by the Maku Tree and faces Twinrova, who is attempting to use the three Flames to revive Ganon, the primary antagonist in the Zelda series. Link defeats both Twinrova and a mindless, poorly resurrected Ganon. He frees Zelda, whose sacrifice {{would have been the}} full resurrection of Ganon; together, they exit the crumbling castle. After the credits, Link is seen waving to a crowd from a <b>sailboat</b> off the shore of a land with a castle in the background.|$|E
5|$|Its {{high density}} and {{resistance}} to corrosion have been exploited {{in a number of}} related applications. It is used as ballast in <b>sailboat</b> keels. Its weight allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of wind on the sails; being so dense it takes up a small volume and minimizes water resistance. It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables.|$|E

50|$|Recreational boats (sometimes called {{pleasure}} craft, {{especially for}} less sporting activities) fall into several broad categories, and additional subcategories. Broad categories include dinghies (generally under 16 ft powered by sail, small engines, or muscle power), paddlesports boats (kayaks, rowing shells, canoes), runabouts (15 - 25 ft powerboats with either outboard, sterndrive, or inboard engines), daysailers (14 - 25 ft <b>sailboats,</b> frequently {{with a small}} auxiliary engine), cruisers (25 - 65 ft powerboats with cabins), and cruising and racing <b>sailboats</b> (25 - 65 ft <b>sailboats</b> with auxiliary engines).|$|R

5|$|Mike {{continues}} to blast the shark with the impulses, {{causing it to}} leap {{out of the water}} again, igniting the bomb as Ellen steers the <b>sailboat</b> towards the shark while thinking back to Sean's demise, the shark's attack on Thea, and when her husband killed the first shark. The broken bowsprit impales the shark in the exact spot where the bomb is, causing it to explode on impact. The shark's corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of the}} sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|E
5|$|The {{flooding}} on Mangaia {{was regarded}} as the worst in almost 50years, as nearly the entire island was affected. According to locals, the ocean surrounding the island became red at one point due {{to the amount of}} soil being washed out to sea. Despite initial reports that the local water supply was contaminated, the International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) stated that it was safe to drink and there was a sufficient amount for all of the islands' 744 residents. Offshore, a <b>sailboat</b> was severely damaged by large swells produced by the storm and {{was on the verge of}} sinking. The sailor managed to secure the vessel and make it safely to shore.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{bands of}} Hurricane Dean {{produced}} heavy rainfall and winds up to 75mph (121km/h) across Antigua and Barbuda. There was no reported {{damage in the}} Leeward Islands or the Virgin Islands since the hurricane turned northward. In the Atlantic, a <b>sailboat</b> bound for Bermuda was caught off guard by the hurricane. The boat, which carried no radio equipment, was spotted by a hurricane hunter plane. The occupants of the boat suffered no injuries. In Bermuda, the hurricanes eastern eyewall produced 81mph (130km/h) sustained winds with gusts up to 113mph (182km/h). Bermuda highest rainfall total from Dean was 2.45in (50.8mm) while parts of the island received 3-5in (76.2–127mm) of rain.|$|E

5|$|The victims' {{bodies were}} found {{floating}} in Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989. The first body was found when several people on board a <b>sailboat,</b> crossing under the Sunshine Skyway, saw an object in the water. The second body was seen floating off the pier in St. Petersburg, two miles north from the first. While the Coast Guard went to recover the second body, a call came in about a third, which was seen floating 200 yards to the east. All three female {{bodies were found}} face down, bound with a rope around the neck, and naked below the waist.|$|E
5|$|While at American {{universities}} in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He {{and his wife}} Elsa returned to Belgium by ship in March, and during the trip they learned that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal <b>sailboat</b> confiscated. Upon landing in Antwerp on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship. The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Gordon Pym {{was born}} {{on the island of}} Nantucket, famous for its fishing harbor and whaling. His best friend, Augustus Barnard, is the son of the captain of a whaling ship. One night, the two boys become drunk and decide, on Augustus's whim, to take {{advantage}} of the breeze and sail out on Pym's <b>sailboat,</b> the Ariel. The breeze, however, turns out to be the beginnings of a violent storm. The situation gets critical when Augustus passes out drunk, and the inexperienced Pym must take control of the dinghy. The Ariel is overtaken by the Penguin, a returning whaling ship. Against the captain's wishes, the crew of the Penguin turns back to search for and rescue both Augustus and Pym. After they are safely back on land, they decide to keep this episode a secret from their parents.|$|E

She asks Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{to take care of}} a shipment of pens while she has gone. Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to put them away for fear of being called lazy, but as she does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of trying to take over Pam's job of office administrator in her absence. Mortified, Erin puts the pens back in the shipping box.|$|E
5|$|Ged flies back to Ogion on Gont, who crafts a new {{staff for}} him. Contrary to Gensher, Ogion insists that all {{creature}}s have a name, and advises Ged {{to confront the}} shadow creature. Ged pursues the creature in a small <b>sailboat,</b> until it lures him into a fog and wrecks the boat on a reef. Ged recovers {{with the help of}} an elderly couple marooned on the island, who give Ged part of a broken bracelet as a gift. Ged patches his boat and escapes the island, pursuing the creature into the East Reach. On the island of Iffish he meets his friend Vetch, who insists on joining him. They journey east far beyond the last known lands before they finally come upon the shadow. Here Ged realizes that the shadow has always been a part of his own spirit. Naming it with his own name, he merges with the shadow creature, understanding and accepting it as part of himself, and thus healing himself.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{also caused}} major effects to marine interests. High waves, {{estimated}} to have exceeded 15ft (4.6m), disabled a <b>sailboat</b> with a crew of six on it. They were quickly rescued after issuing a distress signal to a nearby tanker vessel. The storm caused the loss of 1,799bags of sorghum from water damage when a freighter encountered Josephine en route to Baltimore, Maryland. The major shipping lanes of North America were severely impacted, with more than 25 ships reporting winds of at least 58mph (93km/h) {{over a period of}} nine days. Furthermore, at least five of those ships reported hurricane force winds during a period of six days. The highest wind speed reported from a ship was 92mph (148km/h), which was observed on October16.|$|E
