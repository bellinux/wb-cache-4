The proposed self-corrected “green ” (low power) coding scheme is constructed by two stages, which are triplication error correction coding (ECC) stage and green bus coding stage. Triplication ECC {{provides a more}} reliable mechanism to advanced technologies. Moreover, in view of lower latency of decoder, it has rapid correction ability to reduce the physical transfer unit <b>size</b> <b>of</b> switch <b>fabrics</b> by self-corrected technique in bit level.

60|$|An {{exposition}} of mercantilism {{would not be}} complete without a statement of the form it assumed in France {{under the guidance of}} Colbert,(14) the great minister of Louis XIV, from 1661 to 1683. In order to create a favorable balance of trade, he devoted himself to fostering home productions, by attempts to abolish vexatious tolls and customs within the country, and by an extraordinary system of supervision in manufacturing establishments (which has been the stimulus to paternal government from which France has never since been able to free herself). Processes were borrowed from England, Germany, and Sweden, and new establishments for making tapestries and silk goods sprang up; even the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> were regulated by Colbert, and looms unsuitable for these sizes destroyed. In 1671 wool-dyers were given a code of detailed instructions as to the processes and materials that might be used. Long after, French industry felt the difficulty of struggling with stereotyped processes. His system, however, naturally resulted in a series of tariff measures (in 1664 and 1667). Moderate duties on the exportation of raw materials were first laid on, followed by heavy customs imposed on the importation of foreign goods. The shipment of coin was forbidden; but Colbert’s criterion of prosperity was the favorable balance of trade. French agriculture was overlooked. The tariff of 1667 was based on the theory that foreigners must of necessity buy French wines, lace, and wheat; that the French could sell, but not buy; but the act of 1667 cut off the demand for French goods, and Portuguese wines came into the market. England and Holland retaliated and shut off the foreign markets from France. The wine and wheat growers of the latter country were ruined, and the rural population came to the verge of starvation. Colbert’s last years were full of misfortune and disappointment; and a new illustration was given of the fallacy that the gain from international trade was not mutual.|$|R

In order to plan the fuzzy logic model, the sewing needle <b>size,</b> number <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> layers and fabric weight were taken into account as input parameters. The output parameter is needle penetration force. In addition, the same parameters and data are used in artificial neural network model.

40|$|This part {{presents}} a dynamic model for predicting the impact compressive responses <b>of</b> warp-knitted spacer <b>fabrics</b> under various loading conditions using quasi-static compressive stress–strain data. The model was established {{based on a}} nonlinear mass-spring-damper system by considering spacer yarns as nonlinear springs with damping effect and representation of their stiffness by the constitutive model developed in Part I. Based on the dynamic model, the impact compressive responses of a typical warp-knitted spacer fabric was parametrically studied in terms of damping ratio, initial velocity, striker mass and contact area. The study indicates that damping can reduce the peak acceleration and peak displacement regardless of loading conditions, and the increase of the initial velocity can enhance the damping effect. Increasing initial velocity or striker mass while keeping the counterpart constant can increase the peak acceleration and peak displacement. However, at a constant kinetic energy, either increasing striker mass or decreasing initial velocity can reduce the peak acceleration, but the peak displacement keeps constant. The study also shows that an optimal <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the spacer <b>fabric</b> exists for achieving minimal peak acceleration under impact at a certain kinetic energy. Experimental validation by drop-weight impact tests demonstrates that the predictions of the dynamic model are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results.
