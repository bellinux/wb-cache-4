40|$|Pasta {{products}} are separated into four product categories: long goods, short goods, noodles and specialty items. Margins and subsequent corporate profits vary with each category. Long and short goods are commodity items. Therefore, they have low margins. Noodle item margins are slightly higher. However, pasta 2 ̆ 7 s highest margins {{are derived from}} the sale of speciality items. These items include Stuffing Shells, Lasagna and Manicotti. Because corporate profits are affected by the sales mix ratio of speciality items to other pasta categories, pasta companies strive to increase their market share of speciality items. Audits to determine stuffing shell quality in packages found on grocery store shelves were conducted in Lowell, MA, Minneapolis, MN, St. Louis, MO and Syracuse NY during April, 1994. Product from four manufacturers was collected. Results of these audits revealed thirty percent, by weight, of all stuffing shells were fractured. It also found two competitors, DaVinnci and Columbia, had lower fractrue rates than either Borden or Hershey. Development of a package that reduces stuffing shell breakage levels found on grocery store shelves will allow a manufacturer to increase its market share. This study examined optimum carton head space, carton orientation and flute construction in a corrugated case to minimize product damage through a distribution system. Test results showed that carton orientation in a corrugated case and carton head space were significant factors in reduced <b>stuffing</b> shell <b>pasta</b> fracture rates...|$|R

50|$|In Northern Italy {{though there}} are many kinds of <b>stuffed</b> <b>pasta,</b> polenta and risotto are equally popular if not more so. Ligurian {{ingredients}} include several types of fish and seafood dishes; basil (found in pesto), nuts and olive oil are very common. In Emilia-Romagna, common ingredients include ham (prosciutto), sausage (cotechino), different sorts of salami, truffles, grana, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and tomatoes (Bolognese sauce or ragù).|$|E
50|$|Tortelloni are <b>stuffed</b> <b>pasta,</b> {{the same}} shape as tortellini, but larger. They are usually stuffed with ricotta cheese and leaf vegetables, such as spinach. Many {{variants}} exist where the vegetables are replaced with stronger ingredients such as porcini or walnuts. Another common filling for tortelloni, {{especially in the}} provinces of Modena and Reggio Emilia, is a paste made mainly of pumpkin pulp and amaretto cookies.|$|E
50|$|Agnolotti are {{prepared}} by immersion in boiling water. Typically, they {{are dressed in}} a beef broth and a little melted butter or in a fresh sage and melted butter sauce, as a complex sauce would detract from the flavours in the agnolotti pockets. In both cases topped with Parmigiano Reggiano cheese but no cheese resides in the agnolotti. The dish is associated with Piedmont in Italy and {{is not to be}} confused with Piacenza's <b>stuffed</b> <b>pasta</b> pockets called 'Anolini'.|$|E
5000|$|Mezzelune ( [...] , [...] ), {{also known}} as Schlutzkrapfen in South Tyrol, Tyrol, and {{neighbouring}} German-speaking regions, are a semi-circular <b>stuffed</b> <b>pasta,</b> similar to ravioli or pierogi. The dough is usually made of white flour or buckwheat flour, durum semolina, mixed with eggs and olive oil. Typical fillings may include cheese (such as ricotta, quark, mozarella, or Bitto), spinach, or mushrooms (e.g., porcini, chanterelles, champignons). There are also recipes with potato, meat, red beet, or sauerkraut filling. The dish may be served with mushroom or pesto sauce, with salsiccia, with seafood, and/or with cherry tomatoes.|$|E
5000|$|Pasta dishes {{particularly}} {{show the}} Italian {{influence on the}} Corsican cuisine. Especially <b>stuffed</b> <b>pasta</b> is popular, like ravioli and cannelloni: both are stuffed with brocciu, similar to the Italian ricotta, ravioli together with spinachs. Pasta sauce with tomatoes and minced meat (Salsa pe a pastasciutta) is also typical. Other preparations reflect the Italian tradition too: sturzaprezi (literally [...] "priest chokers") are large gnocchi baked in an oven made with brocciu and spinach, akin to the Italian dumpling version of this dish; Panizzi are fritters prepared with gram flour [...] similar to the Sicilian panelle. Lasagne and gnocchi with meat sauce (lasagne incu a salsa and Gnocchi manera bastiaccia, [...] "Gnocchi at the mode of Bastia"), are also popular. Although corn polenta is known, in Corsica Pulenta for antonomasia is that prepared with chestnut flour, pulenta castagnina. Another dish whose main ingredient is chestnut flour is Maccaredda, fritters fried together with panzetta (bacon). Razighe, from Rusio, are thin dough pancakes made of wheat flour, yeast, egg and cracklings (a byproduct of sdruttu processing). Migliacci are savory galettes made of wheat flour, yeast, whey, goat and sheep cheese, baked on chestnut leaves.|$|E
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} (RF) {{applications to}} food process {{are well known}} due {{to the possibility of}} quickly and uniformly heating food matrix (1). Fresh <b>stuffed</b> <b>pasta</b> conventional production technology consists of a first steam pasteurization for a period varying from 2 to 10 min depending on pasta size and weight, initial microbial density and wet steam or superheated steam, followed by a drying phase with forced hot air at a temperature not exceeding 65 °- 70 °C to increase pasta consistency and stabilize the shape. Fresh semolina pasta RF pasteurization/pre-drying process is already used by some companies a reduction of microbiological parameters, reduced time pasteurization, a better cooking bheavior, keeping g a great intensity taste and aroma the typical of fresh semolina pasta. Fresh <b>stuffed</b> <b>pasta</b> production has several healthy and technology problems with respect to fresh semolina pasta, thus RF pasteurization/pre-drying process requires a proper implementation and evaluation of effects on different types of products. In this study we have examined three different types of fresh <b>stuffed</b> <b>pasta,</b> cappelletti stuffed with ham, fagottini stuffed with cheese and tortellini stuffed with meat. Three different RF treatments were carried out: 3 kV were applied to fresh pasta stuffed with ham and meat and 2 kV to fresh pasta stuffed with ricotta cheese for a total time of 10 and 8 min, respectively. RF plant consists of a single steel tunnel, in which electrodes are placed and kept at 27. 12 MHz, were simultaneously pre-drying and pasteurization of fresh pasta occurs (2). Microbiological analysis of fresh <b>stuffed</b> <b>pasta</b> different samples, pre-and postpasteurization, were made by the Tempo® System (bioMériux, France). Preliminary results in different types of fresh <b>stuffed</b> <b>pasta</b> show that RF pasteurization/ pre-drying process cause reduction of some microbiological parameters...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{batches of}} a <b>stuffed</b> <b>pasta</b> product, tortellini, and {{slightly}} pre-fried breaded reconstituted turkey steaks {{with cheese and}} ham filling, Cordon Bleu, were prepared according to commercial recipes, then inoculated with 104 CFU/g of Staphylococcus aureus (in case of tortellini) and with 106 CFU/g of Listeria monocytogenes (in case of Cordon Bleu) prior to packing in plastic bags under a gas atmosphere of 20 % CO 2 and 80 % N 2. The inoculated packages were irradiated at 3 kGy (tortellini) and 2 kGy (Cordon Bleu) with a 60 Co radiation source. The applied radiation doses were sensorially acceptable for these products. The experimental batches of tortellini were stored at 15 °C, while the Cordon Bleu samples were stored at 5 and 9 °C. Unirradiated samples were kept together with the respective irradiated ones. Storage was continued for 4 weeks and microbiological tests were performed {{before and after the}} irradiation, and subsequently after every seven days. Besides selective estimation of the counts of the test organisms, total aerobic counts were evaluated in all samples and in case of Cordon Bleu, colony counts of lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, sulphite reducing clostridia, yeasts and moulds were also selectively estimated. The 3 -kGy dose reduced the S. aureus count in tortellini below the detection limit (logCFU= 0. 26), and it remained undetectably low in the irradiated samples during all 28 days of storage, while the S. aureus count in the unirradiated samples increased up to 108 CFU/g during 8 days. The Listeria count in Cordon Bleu was reduced by irradiation from the initial count of 6. 1 to 3. 5 logCFU/g. At 5 °C storage, this residual count remained stagnant up to 3 – 4 weeks, but started to increase at 9 °C after one week of storage. In the unirradiated samples, the Listeria count increased hundred-fold during 4 weeks at 5 °C, and during 2 weeks at 9 °C. Sulphite reducing clostridia were, and remained, undetectable (< 0. 48 logCFU/g) in all samples even at 9 °C. The limiting factor of the shelf-life of the unirradiated poultry products was the growth of lactic acid bacteria at 9 °C, whereas enhanced lipid oxidation was an unwanted side-effect of radiation treatment. From these studies it can be concluded that the potential risk posed by the investigated non-sporeforming pathogenic bacteria could be considerably reduced by gamma irradiation, however, storage temperature remains a crucial factor of safety and methods should be developed to counteract the lipid-oxidative effect of the radiation processing...|$|E
