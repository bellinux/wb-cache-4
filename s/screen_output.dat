40|$|When {{producing}} halftones {{with the}} screening technique, tiling is generally {{used to construct}} a screen of appropriate size with screens of small fixed size. Regular tiling and random tiling are two common tiling schemes used nowadays. The former scheme produces periodic screens which introduce harmonic distortion to the <b>screening</b> <b>outputs</b> while the latter may introduce blocking artifacts as the possible connections among adjacent blocks are too many for a training algorithm to train the small screens that are used for tiling. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a new tiling scheme that allows one to train small screens to construct large screens seamlessly. Simulation results show that a screen constructed with the proposed tiling screen bears blue noise characteristics, contains no blocking artifacts and little harmonic distortion.

30|$|It is {{possible}} that the host machine of the device is compromised by malware. This allows the attacker to be able to intercept user name and password, perhaps through the hacked browser cookies or monitoring host machine input channels such as keyboards or mouse. The attacker can use the stolen user name and password to access the bank application server. However, the bank application server in our system will request an AIK digital certificate upon log-in request. Since the AIK digital certificate can only be generated by the genuine TED owner using a private part of the AIK key that never leaves the TPM inside the device, the attacker cannot provide the legitimate AIK certificate and therefore cannot access the private data stored in the application server. However, the device cannot prevent the interception of the <b>screen</b> <b>outputs</b> such as displayed bank balance to be captured by the attacker.|$|R

Introduction Decision making is the process of selecting the best course of action from all the available alternatives. In almost all real-world problems, the multiplicity of criteria for judging an alternative is pervasive.

40|$|Abstract: Fault {{screeners}} {{are simple}} software (or hardware) constructs that detect variable value errors based on unary invariant checking. In this paper we evaluate {{and compare the}} performance of two low-cost screeners (Bloom filter, and range screener) that can be automatically integrated within a program, while being automatically trained during the testing phase. While the Bloom filter has the capacity of retaining virtually all variable values associated with proper program execution, this property comes with a much higher false positive rate per unit training effort, compared to the more simple range screener, that compresses all value information {{in terms of a}} single lower and upper bound. We present a novel analytic model that predicts the false positive and false negative rate for both type of screeners. We show that the model agrees with our empirical findings. Furthermore, we describe the application of both screeners, where the <b>screener</b> <b>output</b> is used as input to a fault localization process that provides automatic feedback on the location of residual program defects during deployment in the field. ...|$|R

Other issues discussed are indexing, run length determination, computational effort, and why FDE is not applicable for terminating simulations.
