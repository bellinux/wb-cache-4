2500|$|ΜΑΘ is {{primarily}} a venue for mathematical competition. [...] Different competitions have varying ways to test the students mathematical [...] knowledge. [...] Each student who chooses {{to participate in a}} competition takes an [...] "individual" [...] test that corresponds to his or her level of competition. [...] All competitions include this feature. [...] Most individual tests consist of 30 multiple-choice questions (not including tie-breakers), A-E, where answer choice [...] "E" [...] is [...] "None of the Above", or [...] "None of These Answers"; abbreviated NOTA. [...] Students are typically allotted 1 hour for the entire test. [...] In most states they are graded on the following scale: +4 points for a correct answer, -1 points for an incorrect answer that was chosen, and 0 points if the question was left blank. [...] This scoring system makes guessing statistically neutral. [...] 120 points is considered a perfect score. [...] Some competitions (e.g., Nationals and - as of the 2012/13 season - MAO-favorite Florida) use alternate, but equivalent systems of scoring, such as +5 for a correct answer, 0 for an incorrect answer and +1 for a blank. [...] A perfect score under this system would be 150. [...] Calculators are never allowed {{to be used in the}} competitions; the <b>statistics</b> <b>division</b> is the exception to this rule. [...] This rule is in place for multiple reasons, [...] the first being that modern calculators may include the ability to solve entire problems without any analyzation of the equation, which would mean that students not having the mathematical knowledge but the ability to use a calculator could unfairly get problems correct. [...] The second reason being so problems can remain arithmetically simple, in other words so that a problem can utilize simple numbers and focus on the concepts without worrying that a calculator would give an advantage of some sort. [...] Statistics is an exception because the field of statistics utilizes calculators and computers tremendously and not allowing calculators would require the students to carry out unavoidable tedious calculations by hand, thus taking away focus from the concepts.|$|E
