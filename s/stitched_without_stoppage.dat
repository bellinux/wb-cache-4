5000|$|In embroidery, an {{overcast}} stitch is a raised line stitch used on even-weave fabrics. It {{is commonly used}} for outlining designs. There are two methods of creating an embroidered {{overcast stitch}}. In one method, a line is stitched to create padding, then another thread covers the padding stitches in small stitches {{at right angles to}} the padding stitches. The other method is called detached overcast stitching, and involves two alternating padding stitches that pick up the fabric, followed by overcast stitches that cover the padding <b>stitches</b> <b>without</b> picking up the fabric.|$|R

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that a subgroup of QW 7437 microbubbles, dodecafluoropentane-based ultrasound contrast microspheres, resides for prolonged periods in the microvasculature. BACKGROUNDQW 7437 produces echo enhancement in myocardium which may persist relatively longer than opacification in the left ventricular cavity. The mechanism for this persistent enhancement remains unknown. METHODSThe transit of fluorescently labeled erythrocytes was examined by fluorescence intravital microscopy in the microvessels in five rat mesenteries. Ten rats were used to observe the behavior of fluorescently labeled QW 7437 microbubbles in the mesenteric microcirculation. RESULTSThere was no significant change in erythrocyte velocity in the arterioles and venules after the administration of QW 7437 microbubbles (0. 05 ml/kg) preactivated by negative hydrodynamic pressure. Of 552 microbubbles observed in four arterioles and five capillaries, 549 (99. 5 %) passed <b>without</b> <b>stoppage</b> (≥ 0. 1 s stoppage); only one stopped transiently in arteriole and two in capillaries, each for < 0. 5 s. Sixty-five of 478 microbubbles (13. 6 %) observed in six postcapillary venules 11 to 30 μm in diameter and 24 of 408 microbubbles (5. 9 %) in four venules 31 to 50 μm in diameter stopped transiently (0. 1 to 180 s) with an attachment to venular endothelium; the remaining microbubbles passed through the venules <b>without</b> <b>stoppage.</b> CONCLUSIONSProlonged survival as microbubbles in the circulation and transient stoppage of a subgroup of microbubbles in the microvasculature, particularly in venules, are potential mechanisms for the persistent tissue echo enhancement by QW 7437 microbubbles during contrast echocardiography...|$|R

50|$|Kasuti work {{involves}} embroidering very intricate patterns like gopura, chariot, palanquin, {{lamps and}} conch shells. Locally available materials {{are used for}} Kasuti. The pattern to be embroidered is first marked with charcoal or pencil and then proper needles and thread are selected. The work is laborious and involves counting of each thread on the cloth. The patterns are <b>stitched</b> <b>without</b> using knots to ensure that {{both sides of the}} cloth look alike. Different varieties of stitches are employed to obtain the desired pattern. Some of the stitches employed are Ganti, Murgi, Neyge and Menthe. Ganti is a double running stitch used for marking vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines, Murgi is a zig-zag stitch, Neyge is a running stitch and Menthe is a cross stitch resembling fenugreek seeds.|$|R
50|$|The thermal {{cantilevers}} are fabricated from silicon wafers using bulk- {{and surface}} micro-machining processes. Probes have a radius of curvatures below 5 nm, enabling sub-10 nm {{resolution in the}} resist. The resistive heating is carried out by integrated micro-heaters in the cantilever legs which are created by different levels of doping. The time constant of the heaters lies between 5 μs to 100 μs. Electromigration limits the longterm sustainable heater temperature to 700-800 °C. The integrated heaters enable in-situ metrology of the written patterns, allowing feedback control, field <b>stitching</b> <b>without</b> the use of alignment markers and using pre-patterned structures as reference for sub-5 nm overlay.

40|$|Evaluate the biomechanical {{behavior}} of four variants of the transosseous-equivalent/suture bridge (TOE/SB) repair. Four suture bridge (SB) constructs were created using 24 sheep infraspinatus tendon-humerus constructs (n = 6 per technique). The groups were (1) Knotted Standard Suture Bridge (Standard SB) -suture bridge with two medial mattress stitches, (2) Knotted Double Suture Bridge (Double SB) -four medial mattress stitches, (3) Untied Suture Bridge with Medial FT Anchors (Untied SB with FT) -two medial mattress <b>stitches</b> <b>without</b> knots, and (4) Untied Suture Bridge with PushLocks (Untied SB with Pushlocks) -two medial mattress <b>stitches</b> <b>without</b> knots. The contact area footprint {{was measured with}} an electronic pressure film prior to dynamic mechanical testing for gapping and testing to failure. The Double SB produced the greatest contact area footprint {{compared to the other}} techniques, which did not differ. The Double SB repair with a mean failure load of 456. 9 N was significantly stronger than the Untied SB with Pushlocks repair at 300 N (P = 0. 023), the standard SB repair at 295 N (P = 0. 019), and lastly the Untied SB with FT repair at 284 N (P = 0. 011). No differences were detected between the two mattress stitch standard SB repair with knots and the knotless two mattress stitch repairs (Untied SB with FT and Untied SB with Pushlocks). Gaps developed during cyclic loading in all repairs apart from the Double SB repair. The transosseous-equivalent/suture bridge repair with 4 stitches tied in the medial row and maximal lateral suture strand utilization (Double SB) outperformed all other repairs in terms of failure load, tendon-bone contact, and gapping characteristics. The presence of knots in the medial row did not change tendon fixation with respect to failure load, contact area or gapping characteristics. 6 page(s...|$|R

So if a traveler wants to create a panoramic mosaic of a scene from pictures he has taken, but realizes back home that his pictures do not overlap, there is still hope. The proposed process has three stages: (i) Images are extrapolated beyond their original boundaries, hoping that the extrapolated areas will cover the gaps between them. This extrapolation becomes more blurred as we move away from the original image. (ii) The extrapolated images are aligned and their relative positions recovered. (iii) The gaps between the images are inpainted to create a seamless mosaic image. 1...|$|R
40|$|Most {{approaches}} to spatial image management involve GPS or image processing. In this thesis, a sensor-focused alternative is explored.

Images {{taken from the}} same viewpoint are successfully arranged using panorama <b>stitching</b> <b>without</b> any image processing. The results compare favourably to conventional methods. While lacking visual definition of image processing methods, they can complement them if used in tandem. Sensor compositing and pedestrian tracking are implemented in a unified system.

30|$|Despite the {{encouraging}} {{results of}} this study, it is acknowledged {{that a number of}} possible limitations and difficulties may exist with respect to the clinical application of this new barbed tenorrhaphy. Firstly, as this new technique was not performed in situ, it has not been possible to assess the ease of suturing in a clinical setting under the constraints of limited exposure, tendon retraction and tension, especially in zone II. Secondly, it has not been possible to assess in vivo factors such as tendon ischemia and healing after repair, edema, and adhesion formation of this new repair. Another critical aspect is that to maintain the integrity of the barbs, no direct handling of the suture is to be performed with fingers or instruments, so if there is a technical error during repair, the suture has to be cut and removed completely, since it is impossible to back up the suture to rethrow a <b>stitch</b> <b>without</b> damaging the barbs. Finally, our biomechanical testing used a linear load to failure, which may not reflect the physiologic conditions as well as cyclic loading models.|$|R

30|$|A {{graphical}} {{user interface}} allows for intuitive operation for both the capture as the processing. A large painting like the Jewish Bride by Rembrandt consisted out of 240 captures, which all need to be stitched {{to each other in}} order to have one coherent capture. Since the registration between our depth and color data perfectly overlaps, we can use the color information to stitch multiple captures in 3 -D, since this is directly linked to the color information. This was again done through SIFT keypoint extraction with sub-pixel accuracy and matching. Since our captures are highly accurate, only basic rotation and translation between consecutive captures were necessary for the <b>stitching,</b> <b>without</b> any need of scaling or warping. Around 20 % overlap was taken between each neighboring capture. After stitching, investigation of the overlap of neighboring captures revealed there was no spatial discrepancy visible between separate captures. On a global scale, we also visually verified the absence of shape deformation caused by our stitching through single images acquired by the institutions themselves. Due to the enormous amount of information captured of this specific painting, data stitching took almost two weeks on a high end PC.|$|R
