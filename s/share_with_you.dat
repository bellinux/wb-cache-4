That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it.

That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E
