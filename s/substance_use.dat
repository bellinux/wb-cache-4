Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, may reduce relapses and hospitalizations. Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse is minimal. Evidence for metacognitive training is mixed with one 2016 review finding benefit and another not. Art or drama therapy have not been well-researched.|$|E

5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This study {{presents}} a comprehensive {{examination of the}} Sport Drug Control Model via survey data of elite Australian athletes. Design: A cross-sectional nationwide mail survey. Methods: A mail survey of 1237 elite Australian athletes was conducted. Structural equation modelling was employed to test the model. Results: Morality (personal moral stance on performance-enhancing <b>substances</b> <b>use),</b> reference group opinion (perceived moral stance of reference group on performance-enhancing <b>substances</b> <b>use)</b> and legitimacy (perceptions of the drug testing and appeals processes) evidenced significant relationships with attitude towards performance-enhancing <b>substances</b> <b>use,</b> which in turn was positively associated with doping behaviour. The model accounted for 81 % and 13 % {{of the variance in}} attitude towards performance-enhancing <b>substances</b> <b>use</b> and doping behaviour, respectively. Conclusions: These findings validate the usefulness of the Sport Drug Control Model for understanding influences on performance-enhancing <b>substances</b> <b>use.</b> Nevertheless, {{there is a need to}} survey athletes representing a broader range of competition levels and cross-cultural research to test the model’s applicability to other populations of athletes...|$|R

Improvements include positive changes in self-reported mental health status, <b>substance</b> <b>use,</b> and overall well-being. These models can also help reduce hospital admissions, length of stay in inpatient psychiatric units, and emergency room visits.|$|E

25|$|Prospective {{epidemiological}} studies {{do not support}} the hypotheses that comorbidity of <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders with other psychiatric illnesses is primarily a consequence of substance abuse or dependence or that increasing comorbidity is largely attributable to increasing use of substances. Yet emphasis is often on the effects of substances on the brain creating the impression that dual disorders are a natural consequence of these substances. However addictive drugs or exposure to gambling will not lead to addictive behaviors or drug dependence in most individuals but only in vulnerable ones, although, according to some researchers, neuroadaptation or regulation of neuronal plasticity, and molecular changes, may alter gene expression in some cases and subsequently lead to <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between negative affect and <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders {{has been the}} most widely studied model of addiction. It proposes that individuals who experience the greatest levels of negative affect are at the greatest risk of using substances or behaviours as a coping (psychology) mechanism. Here, substances and behaviours are used to improve mood and distract from unpleasant feelings. Once physical dependence has been established, substance abuse is primarily motivated by a desire to avoid negative affective states associated with withdrawal. Individuals high in affective mood disorders (anxiety) most commonly report high levels of negative affect associated with cravings. The {{relationship between}} negative affect and addiction is not unidirectional. That is, while positive affect increases the likelihood of initiation of <b>substance</b> <b>use,</b> the negative affective states produced by withdrawal are the most commonly reported factors for continued use.|$|E
