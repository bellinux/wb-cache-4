This study investigated the physiological response of tidewater goby, Eucyclogobius newberryi, an endangered California fish, when competing for food with threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a native species, and rainwater killifish, Lucania parva, a non-native species. Survival, growth and physiological indicators of stress (i. e. cortisol, glucose and lactate concentrations) were assessed for juvenile fish held for 28 days in two food-limited conditions. When fed a 75 % <b>ration,</b> <b>survival</b> of E. newberryi was significantly lower when held with G. aculeatus. In all fish assemblages, weight and relative condition decreased then stabilized over the 28 day experiment, while length remained unchanged. Whole-body cortisol in E. newberryi was not affected by fish assemblage; however, glucose and lactate concentrations were significantly higher with conspecifics than with other fish assemblages. When fed a 50 % <b>ration,</b> <b>survival</b> of E. newberryi decreased during the second half of the experiment, while weight and relative condition decreased and length remained unchanged in all three fish assemblages. Cortisol concentrations were significantly higher for all fish assemblages compared with concentrations at the start of the experiment, whereas glucose and lactate concentrations were depressed relative to concentrations at the start of the experiment, with the magnitude of decrease dependent on the species assemblage. Our findings indicate that E. newberryi exhibited reduced growth and an elevated generalized stress response during low food availability. In response to reduced food availability, competition with G. aculeatus had the greatest physiological effect on E. newberryi, with minimal effects from the non-native L. parva.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the effect of different levels of dietary intake and feeding frequencies on growth and survival of bigheadcarp, Aristichthys nobilis, fry. The feeding rates consisted of 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % of body weight while feeding frequencies were one, three, and five times daily. Results showed that final weight, final length, and specific growth rate (SGR) differed in relation to feeding rate but not to feeding frequency. Highest values were obtained for fish on the 30 % ration and fed once a day. A significant effect of higher feeding rate using lower feeding frequency on growth was manifested in final mean weight and SGR; increasing feeding rate resulted in increased growth. Feeding frequency significantly influenced fry survival with highest values observed when fry were fed once or three times per day. Highest survivals were achieved by fry on the 30 % ration fed once daily. At higher feeding rates using lesser feeding frequencies better survival was noted.

40|$|Emerging {{preclinical}} {{evidence suggests}} {{the involvement of}} sex hormones and their receptor signals {{in the development and}} progression of bladder cancer. Meanwhile, previous studies have demonstrated conflicting results on the relationship between the status of sex hormone receptors in urothelial tumors and histopathological characteristics of the tumors or patient outcomes. We therefore conducted this meta-analysis to assess the clinicopathological impact of the expression of androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptors (ERs) in bladder cancer. A comprehensive literature search in databases (i. e. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane) was performed for all immunohistochemical studies stained for AR, ERα, and/or ERβ in surgically resected bladder cancer specimens and analyzed for patient outcomes. We selected eligible studies in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines and analyzed data using R software. A total of 2, 049 patients from 13 retrospective studies were included in this meta-analysis. The difference in ERα expression between non-tumors and tumors was significant [odds ratio (OR) = 0. 412; P< 0. 001], while those of AR (OR = 3. 256; P = 0. 336) or ERβ (OR = 0. 580; P = 0. 674) were not statistically significant. AR positivity in tumors was strongly correlated with gender (male vs. female: OR = 0. 658; P = 0. 027) or tumor grade (low-grade vs. high-grade: OR = 0. 575; P< 0. 001). ERβ positive rates were significantly higher in high-grade (OR = 2. 169; P< 0. 001) and muscle-invasive (OR = 3. 104; P< 0. 001) tumors than in low-grade and non-muscle-invasive tumors, respectively. Survival analysis in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer revealed associations between AR expression and better recurrence-free <b>survival</b> [hazard <b>ration</b> (HR) = 0. 593; P = 0. 006) as well as between ERβ expression and worse recurrence-free (HR = 1. 573; P = 0. 013) or progression-free (HR = 4. 148; P = 0. 089) survivals. These data suggest down-regulation of ERα expression in bladder tumors, compared with non-neoplastic urothelial tissues. AR or ERβ expression was down- or up-regulated, respectively, in high-grade and/or muscle-invasive bladder cancers. Moreover, immunohistochemistry of AR/ERβ in surgical specimens may serve as prognosticators in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder tumor...|$|R

However, variable mid-temperate and low-latitude winters may interact with scaling of size, metabolism, and energy reserves to cause energy deficits and require trade-offs between foraging and predation. A dynamic optimization model explored how ration, fall fat, and both non- and size-selective predation influenced foraging (i. e., fast or forage) and energy allocation (i. e., length or fat) decisions that maximize winter survival of age- 0 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). During a mid-latitude (38 ° N) winter, a pond experiment in which age- 0 fish occurred {{with or without}} adult conspecific predators tested {{a subset of the}} model. In the model without predators, winter foraging occurred, with small size only reducing <b>survival</b> when low <b>ration</b> and low fall fat caused small fish to exhaust reserves. With predation, all sizes foraged to maintain mass and fat reserves when ration was sufficiently high, with small fish also growing in length. When modeled predation was nonselective, size-dependent mortality varied in complex ways. In contrast, size-selective predators consistently reduced survival of small fish. Generally consistent with the model, fish in ponds without predators gained mass and energy content, while those with predators only maintained these parameters. All small individuals grew more than large counterparts in length. Mortality in ponds never depended on size but was ~ 20 % higher with predators. Energy deficits often demand active foraging during mid-temperate winters, with predation rather than energy depletion influencing size-dependent survival...|$|R

Utilizaram-se farelo de soja + farinha de peixe (FS + FP), FS, FS + farelo de canola (FS + FC) e FS + levedura desidratada (FS + LD), com níveis de inclusão da FP, FC e LD de 19, 60 %, 32, 00 % e 39, 20 %, respectivamente, correspondendo a 50, 55 %, 48, 19 % e 61, 30 % de substituição da proteína bruta do FS pelas de FP, FC e LD, respectivamente. Não houve diferenças significativas (P > 0, 01) para a sobrevivência e R$ em ração/kg ganho entre os tratamentos. Os peixes alimentados com FS + FP, FS e FS + FC apresentaram valores de peso final e comprimento total que não diferiram entre si (P > 0, 01), porém superiores aos que receberam FS + LD. Para ganho de peso, os peixes alimentados com FS + FC apresentaram valores superiores ao FS + LD, mas ambos os tratamentos não diferiram (P > 0, 01) do FS + FP ou do FS. A taxa de eficiência protéica e conversão alimentar aparente dos peixes que receberam FS + LD foram piores (P Different proteic {{sources were}} {{evaluated}} for curimba fingerlings (Prochilodus lineatus) to check performance and economical viability for fingerlings {{with an average}} weight of 10. 47 ± 2. 11 g and a total initial length of 8. 85 ± 0. 64 cm, distributed in a completely randomized design with four treatments and four replications, in sixteen 1, 000 L ponds. Soybean meal + fish meal (SM + FM); soybean meal (SM); SM + canola meal (SM + CM) and SM + dry yeast (DY), with inclusion levels of FM, CM and DY of 19. 60 %, 32. 00 % and 39. 20 % respectively, corresponding to 50. 55 %, 48. 19 % and 61. 30 % of crude protein substitution by FM, CM and DY respectively, were used. There {{were no significant differences}} (P > 0. 01) for <b>survival</b> and <b>ration</b> R$/gain kg between treatments. The fishes fed with SM + FM, SM and SM + CM showed values of final weight and total length with differences between them (P > 0, 01), but higher than those that received SM + DY. For weight gain the fishes fed with SM + FC showed values higher than SM + DY, but both treatments did not show differences (P > 0, 01) of SM + FM or SM. The proteic efficiency rate and apparent feed conversion of fishes that received SM + DY were lower than (P < 0, 01 and P < 0, 05 respectively) SM + FM or SM + FC, however SM showed similar values in all treatments. Water temperature was below the recommended one, the pH remained within the adequate levels and electrical conductivity was below the levels that were recorded in ponds. It was concluded that protein sources constituted by SM + FM; SM + CM or only SM provided the best performance however all alternative tested sources may be given to curimba fingerling...|$|R
40|$|Seahorses (Teleostei: Syngnathidae) are {{subjects}} of worldwide demand for medicinal use, as curios, and as live ornamental aquarium fish. Aquaculture {{has the potential}} to replace or at least supplement potentially unsustainable wild exploitation as the supply source of seahorses. The primary aim of the research within this thesis was to determine techniques for improving the technical and economic feasibility for commercially culturing the big-bellied seahorse Hippocampus abdominalis in New Zealand. In a preliminary investigation, the breeding of wild H. abdominalis in captivity and rearing of juveniles was examined, as difficulties have been encountered with these in historical attempts at culturing H. abdominalis. Breeding was found to be facilitated by providing tanks with a water height of 1 m. This depth of water allowed females to transfer their eggs to male seahorses during the vertical rising stage of mating. Growth rates of progeny to sexual maturity were reasonable with seahorses reaching an average 11 cm in standard length (SL) at one year of age, but high juvenile mortality was observed in {{the first few months of}} age, with an average 10. 6 % of juveniles surviving to one year. Further on-growing of these first generation progeny to seven years of age (average of 27 cm SL for both sexes) demonstrated the robustness of the species in captivity and potential to supply large seahorses to the medicinal trade where large size is desirable. To improve juvenile survival and growth, the effects of initial tank colour, lighting arrangement and stocking density on early juveniles were tested. Juveniles at one week of age were found to have higher attack rate and capture success on Artemia nauplii in clear jars than those contained in white- or black-wrapped jars, but this effect of tank colour had less affect on one month-old juveniles. Juveniles were also found to suffer fewer incidences of air bubble ingestion in side-illuminated tanks due to positively phototactic prey (Artemia) being drawn away from the water surface. The rearing of juveniles from birth to two months of age in glass aquaria with side-illumination and tank surfaces blacked-out above the waterline resulted in survival rates of > 80 % due to increased feeding efficiency and reduced risk of air bubble ingestion. Juvenile growth and survival at stocking densities of 1, 2 and 5 juveniles l- 1 demonstrated that increasing stocking density resulted in reduced growth and survival, due to the greater occurrence of juveniles grasping and wrestling each other with their prehensile tails. Producing live foods for fish is a significant cost in finfish culture. This has led to concerted efforts to develop appropriate artificial or inert diets to reduce culture costs. To determine whether juvenile seahorses could be weaned from live food to inert diets, two inert diets (Golden Pearls and frozen copepods) were tested. It was demonstrated that one and two month-old juvenile H. abdominalis could ingest and survive on these inert foods. Co-feeding the inert diets with live Artemia improved feeding on the inert foods. However, growth and survival rates of juveniles on the inert diets were inferior to those fed only on live enriched Artemia. Cultured live foods such as Artemia are often enriched with various enrichment media to boost their nutritional value. However, enrichment media can vary in their nutritional value relative to the final target organisms they are being fed to, as well as their relative cost-effectiveness. Therefore, the effect of different Artemia enrichments on the growth and survival of H. abdominalis and their relative cost-effectiveness was tested using three commercial enrichment products (Super Selco®, DHA Protein Selco® and Algamac- 3050 ®) and a low-cost Artemia on-growing diet (EPABSF/Spirulina platensis). On a cost/benefit basis, EPABSF/S. platensis worked out to be the most cost- effective for H. abdominalis, with comparable growth rates to seahorses fed Artemia enriched with DHA Protein Selco® and Algamac- 3050 ®. Juvenile growth rates were poorest on Artemia enriched with Super Selco®. Feeding seahorses frozen mysid shrimp may help reduce culture costs and also increase cultured seahorse marketability to the aquarium trade, but their efficacy in seahorse culture is largely untested. Frozen mysids (Amblyops kempi) were shown to be an acceptable alternative to live enriched Artemia for H. abdominalis, providing comparable rates of seahorse growth and <b>survival.</b> When daily <b>rations</b> of frozen mysids at 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 % wet body weight (wbw) were tested there was no growth advantage to feeding seahorses more than 5 % wbw per day in terms of increase in seahorse length. There was a wet weight gain and Condition Factor (CF) advantage associated with increasing feed ration > 10 %. Feed conversion ratios (FCR) became less efficient as feed ration increased based on the total amount of mysids offered to seahorses, with increasing food wastage. However, when actual mysid consumption was taken into account there were no significant differences in FCR between rations. The natural diet and male reproductive output of H. abdominalis in Wellington Harbour was examined for use as aquaculture benchmarks. Natural diet consisted mainly of epibenthic and epifaunal crustaceans (e. g. amphipods, mysid shrimp and caridean shrimp). There were no sex-related differences in diet although there were some size- related differences with smaller seahorses consuming more amphipods. Some of the prey species eaten by wild H. abdominalis may show potential as cultured foods. Wild males produced an average of 271 juveniles per brood, with brood size increasing with parent male size. Comparison of wild reproductive output data with those of cultured male H. abdominalis revealed that cultured male output was approximately 27 % lower than that of wild males. However, there were no differences in the quality (size and weight) of the juveniles produced by wild and cultured male H. abdominalis. It is suggested that cultured female reproductive output is the primary determinant in lower cultured male seahorse reproductive output. The research within this thesis has contributed to improving the technical and economic feasibility for commercially culturing the big-bellied seahorse Hippocampus abdominalis...|$|R
