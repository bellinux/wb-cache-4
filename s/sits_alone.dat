500|$|Sometime later, mutant {{rights are}} finally {{obtained}} and Xavier's school is still operating with Storm as headmistress. The President of the United States appoints McCoy as {{ambassador to the}} United Nations. Rogue reveals to Bobby Drake that she has taken the cure, much to his disappointment.

500|$|Whilst Lynette Porter {{thought that}} Gwen became a [...] "fallen woman" [...] through her affair with Owen, she {{observed}} that this made Gwen's role {{in relation to}} Jack in [...] "End of Days", analogous to that of Mary Magdalene to Jesus, reinforcing a prevalent biblical subtext. Gwen keeps a vigil at Jack's [...] "Torchwood tomb" [...] and like Magdalene is rewarded for her loyalty by being the first to lay eyes upon the risen saviour. Valerie Frankel surmised that [...] "Gwen's journey is one we all face [...] she discovers the dominant intuition within, and then embraces it within the darkest caves of her inner self". David Cornelius stated that Gwen's Torchwood adventures {{take her to the}} brink, and additionally show [...] "she's strong enough to pull herself back". Stephen James Walker also felt that Gwen is still a redeemable character because she recognises her own moral failings, as seen in [...] "Combat" [...] where she <b>sits</b> <b>alone</b> sobbing over pizza, before picking herself up and trying to do better in the future. On this track, Torchwood actor Kai Owen justified Gwen's treatment of Rhys in her darkest moments by arguing that Gwen's intentions always remained pure, no matter how badly she treated Rhys.|$|E
2500|$|The {{small boy}} panel: In this panel {{a small boy}} <b>sits</b> <b>alone</b> on a field with {{children}} playing and other activity in the background. Kurelek describes this as [...] "an actual memory of the time my mother complained to the teacher about us Kurelek children being bullied and then they retaliated by shunning us altogether." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{being put}} back into society, Winston meets Julia in a park. She {{admits that she}} was also tortured, and both reveal betraying the other. Later, Winston <b>sits</b> <b>alone</b> in the Chestnut Tree Cafe. As he remembers a rare happy memory of his family, he convinces himself that it is false. A raucous celebration begins outside, celebrating Oceania's [...] "decisive victory" [...] over Eurasian armies in Africa, and Winston imagines himself {{as a part of}} the crowd. As Winston imagines a gun being pointed at his head, he feels that he has at last ended his [...] "stubborn, self-willed exile" [...] from the love of Big Brother—a love Winston returns quite happily as he looks up in admiration at a {{portrait}} of Big Brother.|$|E
2500|$|Episode eight {{ended the}} series with a {{generally}} positive critical reception, with many praising {{the performances of}} Tennant and Colman. Radio Times praised Tennant's performance, saying that [...] "the episode belonged to [...] ". They also heavily praised the ending to the Joe Miller case, labeling the resolution [...] "brilliant" [...] and claiming [...] "Yes, he got off, but writer Chris Chibnall and his fabulous cast fashioned a quite brilliant climax where justice of a sort was done". Digital Spy responded positively, labeling the finale [...] "satisfying and unsatisfying - complete closure has not been achieved. Reflecting the inequality and injustices of everyday life, Chibnall's choices for the finale were thoughtful, saddening and even worrying. A brave move, just as the entire two series have been". They also praised Tennant's performance, they said [...] "It's a cracking performance from the actor who delves deep to deliver some fiery moments but also, having solved the Sandbrook case, his own breakdown at the station - as he <b>sits</b> <b>alone</b> and cries - is touching and deserved". The Independent, in a mixed review, praised many of the cast by saying [...] "Whenever the plot dragged, we could rely on Ellie (Olivia Colman), Beth (Jodie Whittaker) or Mark (Andrew Buchan) for a performance which delivered that missing emotional connection".|$|E

60|$|I waited, {{when the}} German courier ceased, to hear {{something}} said of this strange story. The silence was unbroken. I looked round, and the five couriers were gone: so noiselessly that the ghostly mountain might have absorbed them into its eternal snows. By this time, I {{was by no means}} in a mood to <b>sit</b> <b>alone</b> in that awful scene, with the chill air coming solemnly upon me - or, if I may tell the truth, to <b>sit</b> <b>alone</b> anywhere. So I went back into the convent- parlour, and, finding the American gentleman still disposed to relate the biography of the Honourable Ananias Dodger, heard it all out.|$|R
