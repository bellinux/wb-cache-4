5000|$|The Mercer Pottery Company {{was started}} in 1868 by James Moses in Trenton, New Jersey and ran {{successfully}} until the 1930s. It claimed to have made the first <b>semi-porcelain</b> ware in the United States. [...] They operated four kilns and employed 120 people with an annual revenue of $150,000 per year. [...] In 1900, the plant faced a strike by its jiggermen who claimed the company paid unfair wages. The issue was brought to a committee formed by parties on both sides to settle the matter, but workers decided that the committee was not deciding fast enough. [...] Despite the strike, the plant continued to operate and the issue remained at the committee. [...] A decade later, the plant threatened to shut down due to, what it considered, unreasonable demands by city inspectors.|$|E
