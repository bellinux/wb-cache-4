40|$|Billions {{of dollars}} are spent {{annually}} in the United States in the largely unregulated market of dietary supplements. Many of these supplements are marketed as weight-loss and athletic-performance-enhancement products. The association of various ephedra-containing products with adverse cardiovascular events {{has led to a}} ban on the sale of these products by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. The result has been the emergence of new formulations marketed for weight loss and athletic-performance enhancement that are “ephedra-free” but contain other <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>substances,</b> the safety of which has not been established...|$|E

Phenelzine (Nardil®) prescribing information notes: “The potentiation of <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>substances</b> and related compounds by MAO inhibitors may result in hypertensive crises (see WARNINGS). Therefore, patients being treated with NARDIL should not take […] L-tyrosine […]”. Interest in the scientific foundation of this claim was generated during routine patient care. A comprehensive literature search of Google Scholar and PubMed revealed no reported cases of hypertensive crisis associated with concomitant administration of L-tyrosine and phenelzine. Review of current US Food and Drug Administration nutritional guidelines relating to ongoing phenelzine studies reveals no mention and requires no consideration of L-tyrosine ingestion in combination with phenelzine. This paper is intended to provide an objective review of the science to then allow the reader to formulate the final opinion.

40|$|In {{the course}} of our recent studies ' on {{hypothermia}} we observed constantly in rats the edema described by J. B. Hamilton, ' as well as the condition of deep narcosis with near or complete loss of reflexes when these animals were chilled to 16 ° C. There was also evidence of hydremia on rewarming similar to that found in monkeys. It was not apparent whether the hydremia is relative or absolute, that is to say, whether the plasma as a whole loses protein, or gains water. Assuming the latter to be the case, it was thought that general neuro-muscular stimulation, {{as is the case with}} a convulsant poison, might serve to withdraw the excess fluid from the blood stream and interstitial tissues into the cells, and in this way promote the recovery of the animal under warming-up conditions. We have, therefore, made a pharmacological approach to the matter of recovery from deep hypothermia. Beginning with the convulsants strychnine, caffeine, and beta-tetrahydronaphthylamine we proceeded, following the lead suggested by the drug last mentioned, to test other <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>substances.</b> Next, following Woodruff, 4 digitalis preparations were used, and finally an alleged antagonist of hibernation, 2 atropine sulphate. Procedure Albino rats were tied in a prone position over a one-eighth inch copper coil about the length of the torso. Through this coil was circulated continually water at 7 °C., the whole procedure being carried out in a room at 3 to 4 °C. In this way a rat's body temperature could be reduced to 16 °C. in about 50 to 60 minutes. As soon as each rat reached as near 16 °C. as possible, it was removed to a constant temperature room at 28 °C. for warmth, and for a study of the recovery process. Each study was made with a pair of rats, to one of which a drug was usually given at this point. During recovery particular attention was paid to the general behavior of each rat, and to the condition of variou...|$|E
40|$|Ephedrine is a <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>{{substance}}</b> used by sportsmen as a {{doping substance}} {{because of its}} stimulating and slimming effects. We report two cases of ventricular arrhythmias induced by abuse of ephedrine in two competitive athletes. Endomyocardial biopsies guided by electroanatomic mapping revealed contraction-band necrosis, a myocardial injury frequently observed in cases of catecholamine excess. Our cases suggest that long-term abuse of ephedrine may result in myocardial damage, and that these structural alterations may promote areas of slow conduction favoring re-entrant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and a long-lasting risk of ventricular arrhythmias...|$|R
40|$|Cocaine {{has been}} {{described}} as having a stimulant action upon sympathetic nerve endings: this idea arose from the observations of Limbourg (1) and of Schultz (2), who showed that cocaine no longer caused a mydriasis after removal of the superior cervical ganglion, an observation which has been repeatedly confirmed. Anitschkow and Sarubin (3) showed that not only is the cocaine mydriasis dependent upon the integrity of the sympathetic innervation of the pupil, but that also the augmentation of the mydriatic action of adrenaline by cocaine which was observed by Fr#{ 246 }hlichand Loewi (4) is found only in the normal pupil. The action of cocaine upon smooth muscle has been inves-tigated in the past upon a number of isolated tissues: that low concentrations stimulate, while higher concentrations inhibit the rhythm and tone of smooth muscle, has been shown in the stomach (Kuroda (5)), the small intestine (Bayliss and Starling (6), Langley and Magnus (7), Kuroda (5)), the uterus (Kuroda (5) Adler (8)), the urinary bladder and the vas deferens (Wad-dell (9)). In contrast to this unanimity is the disagreement about the site of action of cocaine: Waddell and Kuroda represent the opinion that the action is directly upon the smooth muscle and that any similarity between the action of cocaine and that of the sympathetic supply to the muscle is accidental. Miller (10), on the other hand, thinks that the action is exerted upon some part of the sympathetic neuro-muscular apparatus, and that cocaine should therefore be regarded as a <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>substance.</b> Burn and Tainter (11) were impressed by the stimu...|$|R
50|$|In South Dakota, Ahlquist {{searched for}} a {{substitute}} for the Chinese plant-derived and scarce ephedrine. It has similar activity to that of adrenaline and noradrenaline - a <b>sympathomimetic,</b> i.e. a <b>substance</b> that stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. The actions of the sympathomimetics confused pharmacologists and physiologists at that time who could not explain how a single agent could have both excitatory and inhibitory effects.|$|R
40|$|Loewi (1) in- 1921 {{showed that}} after sympa-thetic {{stimulation}} there {{was released from}} the frog heart an adrenaline-like substance. Cannon and Lissak (2) in 1939 found that cat hearts con-tained a <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>substance</b> which they concluded to be adrenaline. Shaw (3) found that mammalian heart extracts contained an adrenaline-like substance which gave an arsenomolybdate color reaction. However, since there was a slight increase of color in Shaw's reaction after adding alkali, it was apparent to him that the color was due only in part to adrenaline. Raab (4) repeat-ing Shaw's experiments with extracts of rat and human hearts found that they contained another catechol in addition to the adrenaline. Euler (5) in 1946 using extracts prepared from cattle heart demonstrated the presence of a sympathomimetic compound which differed from adrenaline and which had the characteristics of noradrenaline. Goodall (6) in 1950 determined the quantity of adrenaline and noradrenaline in cattle heart. Sub-sequently Holtz, Kroneberg, and Schumann (7) and Hokfelt (8) also demonstrated the presence of adrenaline and noradrenaline in mammalian heart. Raab and Gigee (9) compared the adrena-line and noradrenaline content of normal human hearts to that of various pathological human hearts. In 1952, Outschoorn and Vogt (10) showed that, on stimulation of the cardioaccelera-tor nerves in the dog, noradrenaline was released in the coronary blood. The neurohormone of the sympathetic nerves is now believed to be noradrenaline (5, 6, 10 - 23). Adrenaline on the other hand apparently serves the purpose of enhancing the myocardial metabo-lism (24 - 27) and increasing the cardiac rate (28 - 30). Both of these catechols dilate the coronar...|$|R
40|$|The {{movements}} of {{a strip of}} fundus from a rat stomach, suspended in a 5 ml. bath at 37 °, are recorded by a spring-loaded lever. The muscle is stretched for 15 to 30 sec. between contractions. 1 ng. 5 -Hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT), 10 ng. acetylcholine or 2 to 10 μg. of histamine all produce contractions, giving tracings about 4 cm. high. In the presence of hyoscine (10 - 7) low concentrations of 5 -HT can be assayed directly from mixtures of the three <b>substances.</b> <b>Sympathomimetic</b> amines interfere with the assay, but this can be overcome. The preparation is robust, potentially suitable for use with an automatic assay apparatus and 10 to 100 times more sensitive than the rat uterus...|$|R
