40|$|Since the new {{educational}} program for telecommunication and telematics engineers (“ir. 2000 ”) came into force in 2001, {{a number of}} project assignments concerning the design and realisation of microwave links, have been carried out. Propagation studies were {{an important part of}} it and are de facto replacing the propagation part of the previous formal course on “Antennas and Propagation” thought by Prof. Van de Capelle, complemented with the lecture on diffraction theory in the previous formal course on “CAD for Microwave Circuits and Antennas”. The first year, the simple effects of shadowing and building penetration were studied for a <b>short-haul</b> <b>link</b> (between my old office and my new home), and the students were pushed into a simple solution for the absence of LOS by using just a passive reflector. The second year, a longer distance link was requested, removing the propagation fun, since the use of high gain antennas and hence small beamwidths reduced it to a nearly LOS problem. This year, we introduced a car, moving on campus, that {{had to be able to}} allow surfing on the internet while driving at moderate speed, and let the students discover the effects of trees, etc. The three examples will be discussed in this paper. After a slow start in the first year, we are now satisfied with the obtained results within the officially allocated hours (105 hours, 3 credit points) ...|$|E

It was a regional sister airline of British United Airways (BUA), Britain's largest wholly private, independent airline of the 1960s. It operated a network of regional, <b>short-haul</b> scheduled routes <b>linking</b> a variety of destinations within Europe, including year-round services from both Channel Islands to BUA's Gatwick base.|$|R
40|$|Losses in <b>short-haul</b> {{broadband}} fiber-optic <b>links</b> {{are primarily}} due to many characteristics of electrooptic devices. In particular, electrical mismatch at the electrical/optical interfaces have been the dominant source of loss. Losses can be significantly reduced and link performance enhanced by reactive matching of the laser and detector modules. The steps {{in the design of}} low-loss fiber-optic links are presented, which are on the basis of (1) two-tier deembedding of laser and photodiodes from test fixtures and (2) reactively matching them to a standard 50 -ohm system. These concepts are demonstrated by design of a link operating at 0. 5 to 1 GHz using reactively matched optical transmitter and receiver modules...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} new uncooled strained {{quantum well}} lasers for SONET/ SDH systems. New Fabry-Perot lasers for <b>short-haul</b> and intermediate <b>link</b> applications are extremely reliable, have high ex-facet power, and have record low threshold currents, making lower packaging costs possible. Uncooled distributed feedback lasers for the long-haul market at 622 Mbits/s and 2. 488 Gbits/s are discussed. These operate from 40 °C to 85 °C with extremely good threshold and power characteristics. In recent years {{there has been}} increased emphasis on cost and performance issues for telecommunications lasers. The drive to push fiber to the curb (FTTC) and fiber to the home (FTTH) can only be fully realized when inexpensive laser transmitter modules become available. The drive for lower cost has forced the move to uncooled semiconductor lasers, which require high output powers and low threshold currents over the temperature range of 40 °C to 85 °C, combined with inexpensive packaging technology. The type of laser used depends primarily on the link length and operating speed. The Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH/SONET/ATM) standards pertaining to the use of either multimode or single-mode lasers specify the basic requirements for spectral purity and operating wavelength range appropriate to the fiber characteristics. They also dictate whether a multimode, Fabry-Perot laser or a single-mode, distributed feedback (DFB) laser is used in the system. 1 For most <b>short-haul</b> and intermediate <b>link</b> length applications, the STM- 1 (155 Mbits/s) and STM- 4 (622 Mbits/s) standards dictate that a Fabry-Perot laser should be suitable. For long-haul applications a distributed feedback laser is recommended for wavelength stability and dispersion. As systems move to higher speeds, such as STM- 16 (2. 5 Gbits/s) the emphasis moves to distributed feedback lasers, even for shorter link lengths...|$|R
40|$|With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of social media services, e-commerce, and many other internet-based services, we are witnessing a rapid growth in the deployment of data centers and cloud computing platforms. As a result, the telecommunications industry has to continue providing additional network capacity to meet the increasing demand for bandwidth. The use of fiber-optic communications {{plays a key role in}} meeting this demand. Coherent optical transceivers improve spectral efficiency by allowing the use of multilevel in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) modulation formats, which encode information onto the optical carrier’s amplitude and phase. However, for <b>short-haul</b> optical <b>links,</b> using noncoherent optical transceivers, also known as intensity-modulated direct-detection (IM/DD) systems, is a more attractive low-cost approach. Since only the intensity of light can carry information, designing power- and spectrally-efficient modulation formats becomes challenging. Subcarrier modulation, a concept studied in wireless infrared communications, allows the use of I/Q modulation formats with IM/DD systems at the expense of power and spectral efficiency. This thesis addresses the problem of optimizing single-subcarrier modulation formats for noncoherent fiber and wireless optical communication systems in order to achieve a good trade-off between spectral efficiency, power efficiency, and cost/complexity. For the single-subcarrier three-dimensional signal space, denoted as raised-QAM in the literature, we propose a set of 4 -, 8 -, and 16 -level modulation formats which are numerically optimized for average electrical, average optical, and peak power. In the absence of error-correcting codes, the optimized formats offer gains ranging from 0. 6 to 3 dB compared to the best known formats. However, when error-correcting codes with performance near capacity are present, the obtained modulation formats offer gains ranging from 0. 3 to 1 dB compared to previously known formats. In addition, laboratory experiments using the obtained 4 - and 8 -ary modulation formats were carried out. The performance improvement over the previously known formats conforms with the theoretical results. To address transceiver complexity, a two-dimensional signal space for optical IM/DD systems is proposed. The resulting modulation formats have simpler modulator and demodulator structures than the three-dimensional formats. Their spectra have in general narrower main lobes but slower roll-off, which make them a good choice for single-wavelength optical systems. The three-dimensional formats are more suitable for wavelength-division multiplexing systems, where crosstalk between adjacent channels is important...|$|R
