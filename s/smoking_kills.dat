40|$|The thesis topic {{bears the}} name: "Aspect of smoking among {{students}} of high medical schools". Smoking is one the most often appearing drug addictions nowadays in Europe. With {{reference to the}} World Health Organization, there are 1. 3 billion of smoking {{people in the world}} today whereas consequences of <b>smoking</b> <b>kill</b> approximately 4. 8 million of people every year, which are 560 people each hour. If the current trend continues, then in the current pace 10 million of people will die of the consequences of cigarette smoking during the year of 2020. Smoking invokes an enormous addiction to nicotine which bears itself considerable economic, social and health problems. There were some students from 1 st and 4 th grade of the present form of studies of all high medical schools selected. Those were students particularly from the schools: SZŠ and VOŠZ České Budějovice, SOŠZ and SOU Český Krumlov, SZŠ Jindřichův Hradec, SZŠ Tábor and SZŠ Písek. In total, 591 of students were responded whereas most of them were girls (87 %). The average age of the responded ones was 17 years. The thesis consists of theoretical and empirical parts. The theoretical part deals with history of cigarette smoking, a definition of drug addiction, chemical composition of cigarette smoke and malignity of individual toxic elements. Further, there is a chapter concerning problem issues of electronic cigarette smoking in the theoretical part. In the conclusion of this part of the thesis, there are some statistical data referring to cigarette smoking stated. There are some findings of quite a few of authors dealing with problem issues of cigarette smoking and addiction to nicotine summarized here. The empirical part consists of findings from my own research analysis which was done with the intention to map the prevalence of smoking among future health workers and their opinion to cigarette smoking among healthcare staff and people preparing for their healthcare career. There are also the respondents' opinions and attitudes included. The aim of the thesis was: 1. : To find the prevalence of smoking of 1 st and 4 th grade of high medical schools students. 2. : To find what influence the respondents' surroundings have on the fact of their smoking. 3. : To find what attitude high medical school students have to healthcare staff smoking cigarettes. To reach the above mentioned aims, there were three hypotheses determined: H 1 : There is a statistically significant difference existing in the prevalence of smoking at 1 st and 4 th grade of high medical school students. H 2 : There is a statistically significant difference existing in the prevalence of cigarette smoking among students coming from families where at least one member smokes. H 3 : There are statistically significant differences in the attitude of 1 st and 4 th grade students to cigarette smoking among healthcare workers. To prove or disprove the mentioned hypotheses there is a method of quantitative research selected. A questionnaire was used to collect the data. The questionnaires including 23 questions were distributed among 591 students of high medical schools of the South Bohemia Region. Their rate of return was 85 %. The collected data were processed in the form of transparent graphs and the hypotheses were statistically tested. Pursuant to the evaluation of respondents' answers including the statistical data testing were proved by the hypothesis which presumed that there were statistically significant differences in the prevalence of cigarette smoking 1 st and 4 th grade students. The difference really exists that the 4 th grade students smoke more often. It is interesting that the most considerable difference is between the schools of SZŠ and VOŠZ České Budějovice. On the contrary, the percentage of smoking students of SOŠZ Český Krumlov in the 1 st grade is considerably high. Hypothesis no. 2 was statistically proved as well. There is a real significant difference exis...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. (Environmental Health) Although {{evidence}} of the hazards of cigarette smoking has been in existence for many decades, {{millions of people around}} the world are still smoking, hundreds of thousands of teenagers take up smoking and the tobacco companies are allowed to continue promoting their products. To the annoyance of non-smokers, smoking is still allowed in many public places, such as restaurants and offices. This study serves, firstly, to provide an overview of the results of research on the dangers of smoking, nicotine addiction and passive smoking. Secondly, a self-completion questionnaire has been applied to a sample of students at eight technikons in South Africa. The questionnaire was designed to investigate the prevalence of smoking among the different population groups and genders to reveal some of the pattems of smoking of students, the factors influencing students' smoking status and to test students' beliefs, opinions and attitudes regarding smoking. The third objective of the study is to develop a theory on cigarette smoking and to propose anti-smoking measures at technikons. Researchers have produced conclusive proof that cigarette smoking is the cause of cancer, respiratory and heart disease and other diseases. <b>Smoking</b> maims and <b>kills</b> {{millions of people around the}} world annually and threatens the health of unborn babies and non-smokers, especially children. Tobacco companies apply the most sophisticated promotion techniques to persuade people to smoke and teenagers and certain other sectors' of the population are targeted by these activities. A study of nicotine addiction reveals that the need for this substance becomes as strong as any of man's basic physiological needs, such as those for food and water. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for many smokers to give up smoking.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of tobacco to Aotearoa, and the socio-political {{context in which}} this occurred, contributed directly to its quick uptake by Māori, {{and led to the}} normalisation in Māori culture and society, of smoking as an imposter “tikanga” (custom, meaning, criterion) (Ryan, 1999). In Māori communities tobacco use and dependence remain a significant barrier to well being and fulfilment of Māori potential to lead long and healthy lives – <b>smoking</b> not only <b>kills</b> more Māori than any other disease – it also robs Māori of the ability to be self determining with regard to health. In 2010, a kaupapa Māori (Māori worldview) smoking cessation programme was initiated, established, promoted and maintained by Māori workers in a high Māori population area in Te Tai Tokerau as an independent community-based initiative. The programme was integrated into the community through well-established work, whānau/family and social relationships and networks and was effective in recruiting young Māori smokers to make at least one quit smoking attempt during a four-week period. This research investigation of a community controlled smoking cessation programme sought to determine the acceptability and outcomes of the programme from the perspectives of the regular smokers who were involved. A literature review was undertaken prior to the research investigation to determine effective elements of smoking cessation interventions (Tane, 2009), demographic data and smoking history of the programme participants’ was analysed, and semi-structured interviews yielded transcripts of rich descriptions in this qualitative descriptive study. The investigation has confirmed the acceptability and positive outcomes of a community led initiative providing evidence based smoking cessation support of nicotine replacement therapy and advice, and demonstrates that Māori smokers can and will make repeated quit attempts if they are well supported to do so within their own whānau and communities. The research highlights the need for equitable and just distribution of sufficient resources to establish kaupapa Māori smoking cessation initiatives within Māori communities and whānau – wherever smokers are – to prevent further unnecessary loss of life through tobacco use. The issue of access to resources and funding is fundamental in addressing the unacceptably high smoking prevalence rates of Māori and there is an urgent need for better provision of and access to evidence-based medications; Māori smokers do want to quit, with support and advice from well-known and trusted peers, available to them quickly and conveniently at home, and in their communities...|$|R
40|$|<b>Smoking</b> related {{conditions}} <b>kill</b> approximately 5, 000, 000 {{people every}} year. There {{is evidence that}} smoking behaviour varies for men and women. Yet, determinants of smoking remain poorly understood, especially by gender. This Ph. D. thesis remediates this important gap in the literature, adopting a novel, transdisciplinary approach. The thesis was an epidemiological investigation of the joint and separate utility of sociodemographic factors, mental health and Social Cognitive Theory constructs as predictors of smoking for men and women. Participants were 3, 502 residents of Queensland, Australia, {{taking part in a}} larger statewide population-based study investigating cancer risk knowledge and behaviours. The study consisted of a CATI telephone interview and a subsequent battery of self-report questionnaires. The thesis entailed four empirical studies. Study 1 (Chapter Two) investigated the utility of sociodemographic factors as predictors of smoking status by gender and by area by gender. Results revealed that sociodemographic variables were poor predictors of smoking status and that predictors of smoking differed by gender when analyses were conducted separately. Younger men and men involved in a relationship {{were more likely to be}} smokers, while younger women and women who were well educated were more likely to be smokers. Gender differences were also present when analyses were conducted by area by gender. In addition, smoking status for urban women was not significantly predicted by any of the employed sociodemographic variables. These results indicated that additional determinants of smoking, such as mental health, should be investigated. Study 2 (Chapter Three) was a psychometric evaluation of a tool utilized in the thesis to measure symptoms of anxiety and depression, the Kessler Scale of Non-Specific Psychological Distress, also known as the K- 10. Results revealed that the K- 10 is a psychometrically sound scale, ideal for measuring symptoms of anxiety and depression in the general population. It was also concluded that the K- 10 is multidimensional, and that the best model for its factor structure is a first-order model composed by four first-order factors: nervousness, restlessness, negative affect and fatigue. Study 3 (Chapter Four) evaluated the discriminant utility of mental health variables measured with the K- 10, separately and jointly with sociodemographic variables, in predicting group membership. The study investigated whether these variables could discriminate between ever-smokers and neversmokers, and among ever-smokers, between current smokers and former smokers by gender. This was intended to provide a glimpse into smoking initiation and smoking persistence. Analyses classified only a small percentage of smokers correctly. Nevertheless, results showed that psychological distress examined alone predicted smoking uptake among women. In contrast, smoking initiation for men was vi predicted by sociodemographic variables. In addition, persistent smoking for men was predicted by psychological distress while that for women it was predicted by sociodemographic factors. Study 4 (Chapter Five) investigated the utility of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) constructs as determinants of smoking. This last empirical study investigated whether the addition of self-efficacy and outcome expectancies to mental health and sociodemographic variables improved prediction of smoking behaviour. Study 4 examined the utility of three models as determinants of measures of smoking among current smokers (smokers who have never attempted to quit and those who attempted to quit and failed). Nicotine dependence, age of smoking initiation, number of cigarettes smoked per day and past quit attempt, as well as intention to quit were the measures of smoking investigated. Results indicated that the full social cognitive model (containing both self-efficacy and outcome expectancy) was the most robust model, although neither self-efficacy nor outcome expectancies as constructs were particularly strong predictors. Nevertheless, self-efficacy was generally better than outcome expectancies. Both self-efficacy and outcome expectancies predicted measures of smoking for men, while only self-efficacy predicted the same measures of smoking for women. None of the models predicted a quit attempt in the last year among males. For women, only decreased fatigue predicted a quit attempt in the last 12 months: In addition, analyses conducted to classify which smokers intended to quit smoking in the near future correctly classified only a small percentage of those who did intend to quit in the near future, but correctly classified most smokers who did not. Analyses investigating which quitting method was most popular among smokers revealed that “going cold turkey” was still the preferred quitting method of more than half of smokers who had attempted to quit in the past 12 months but failed. Less than 15 % of those who “went cold turkey” had also employed a cessation aid. The thesis supports the hypothesis that determinants of smoking differ by gender. The role of psychological distress in smoking uptake among women and in smoking persistence among men warrant further investigation. Future research should also examine the effect of other types of selfefficacy upon smoking behaviour. Smoking prevention and/or cessation programs might be more effective if conducted for men and women separately, addressing the particular determinants of smoking for each gender...|$|R
5000|$|The story {{takes place}} at Springfield Highschool, it's prom night and the gym is {{decorated}} with homemade decorations. The show begins when the school's principal, Principal Varney welcomes the class of 1958 to their Super Senior Prom and introduces the night's entertainment, The Marvelous Wonderettes. As the lights come up on the girls they sing [...] "Mr. Sandman". Each in their respective colors; Missy - tangerine, Suzy - blue, Cindy Lou - pink, and Betty Jean - green. During the song it becomes apparent that Suzy is dating the guy running the lights for the prom, Ritchie Stevens. After introducing themselves, the girls begin their second song of the evening [...] "Lollipop" [...] which transitions into [...] "Sugartime". After the song, the girls show off the cheer that won them third place at the State Song Leaders' competition and say thank the teacher who leads their team, Mr. Lee. When Betty Jean runs off to put their trophy in the school trophy case, Cindy Lou seizes her opportunity to steal Betty Jean's song, [...] "Allegheny Moon". Hilarity ensues when Betty Jean returns to find that she's been duped. She tries her hardest to ruin Cindy Lou's performance, but Cindy Lou {{finds a way to}} recover. After the song, Suzy and Missy explain to the prom goers (audience members) the events which led to them providing the entertainment that evening. Turns out that the boys from the glee club were supposed to perform, but the lead singer, Billy Ray Patton, was suspended from school for <b>smoking</b> ("Tobacco can <b>kill,</b> and make you ill."), so Mr. Lee called on The Marvelous Wonderettes to take their place. The girls announce that the theme of the prom is [...] "Marvelous Dreams" [...] and segue nicely into a medley of [...] "All I Have to Do Is Dream" [...] and [...] "Dream Lover". Missy then announces the nominees for that year's Prom Queen, who will get to choose her King after winning the vote. All four of the Marvelous Wonderettes are nominated along with Judy Carter, a girl who they have homeroom with. Then it's time for the dreamcatcher, which will determine the order in which the girls will sing their solos. Suzy is selected to go first. In her giggly excitement, Suzy announces that her song is for her prom date, Ritchie, and then begins to sing [...] "Stupid Cupid". Next up is Betty Jean, who sings [...] "Lipstick on Your Collar", during which we discover that her boyfriend, Johnny, has been cheating on her with Cindy Lou. A confrontation between the two girls, is broken up by Suzy who urges Betty Jean to calm down and continue with the performance. Cindy Lou is up next and singe [...] "Lucky Lips". As she sings, Betty Jean stands in the background mocking her performance, attempting to thwart Cindy Lou, but once again, Cindy Lou recovers gracefully. The only one left to sing is Missy, who sings [...] "Secret Love". After her song, she announces that her secret love is Mr. Lee, the girl's Songleader Leader. Mr. Lee (who was chosen from the audience {{at the top of the}} show), is brought on stage and the girls serenade him with the songs, [...] "Mr. Lee", [...] "Born Too Late", and [...] "Teacher's Pet". After returning Mr. Lee to his seat, and announcement is made over the loudspeaker that it's time for the talent portion of the Prom Queen competition. Missy explains that in order to keep things moving along, the rules committee has decided that all the girls will perform their talents simultaneously and only have 30 seconds in which to perform. Judy Carter has been excused from the talent portion because of a doctor's appointment. The girls scramble to set up their talents. Cindy Lou shows off a myriad of poses, Missy sings her best note over and over again, Suzy uses a lemon twist while blowing giant bubbles with her gum, and Betty Jean rushes to set up her fire baton routine, but the buzzer goes off before she has time to even light the baton. Now it is time for everyone to vote for Prom Queen. The audience take out their ballots (included in the playbill) and circle their choice for prom queen as the girls wander through the theatre collecting the completed ballots. When the ballots are collected they are given to the girl's French teacher, Miss McPhereson, who is supposed to count them. As the ballots are being tallied, the girls sing a medley of [...] "Sincerely" [...] and [...] "Goodnight Sweetheart, Goodnight". At the end of the song, it is announced that Suzy has been voted Prom Queen! Cindy Lou, who expected to win, is distraught, Betty Jean couldn't be happier that Cindy Lou lost, and Suzy is so surprised she chokes on her gum. Missy announces that now it's time for Suzy to pick her Prom King. The girls ask her three questions, and through Suzy's answers discover that she has, to no one's surprise, chosen her prom date, Ritchie Stevens. Since she won, Suzy gets to sing a spotlight song, [...] "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me", which swells at the end when the other girls join in. The girls gather around and congratulate Suzy, except for Cindy Lou who reaches out to touch the crown as the lights fade and intermission begins.|$|R

40|$|<b>Smoking</b> <b>kills</b> {{over half}} a million women each year and is the most {{important}} preventable cause of female premature death in several developed countries. However, in many countries, cigarette smoking still tends to be regarded as a mainly male problem. This paper explores the reasons why more attention needs to be paid to issues around smoking and women, even in countries which currently have low levels of female cigarette smoking. The article includes an overview of current patterns and trends of smoking among women, and the factors which influence smoking uptake and cessation in women compared to men. The experience of countries with the longest history of widespread female smoking is used to identify some of the key challenges facing developed and developing countries. Tobacco companies have identified women as a key target group, therefore particular attention is given {{to the ways in which}} they have attempted to reach women through advertising and other marketing strategies. It is concluded that in order to halt and ultimately reverse the tobacco epidemic among women, tobacco control policies need to encompass both gender-specific and gender-sensitive approaches. Examples are given of the types of action that are needed in relation to research, public policy and legislation, and education. <b>Smoking</b> <b>kills</b> {{over half a}} million women around the world each year and this number is increasing rapidly 1. It is estimated that between 1950 and 2000, 10 million women will have died from their smoking habit. In several developed countries, such as the USA and the UK, cigarette smoking is now the single most important preventable cause of premature death in women, accounting for at least a third of all deaths in women aged 35 to 691. Yet, despite these figures, smoking is still regarded in many countries as being a mainly male problem. This is due primarily to two main reasons. 1. Cigarette smoking prevalence among women in many countries, particularly developing countries, is still low compared to men. 2. Because of the time lag between smoking becoming a widespread habit and the emergence of tobacco-related health problems, no country has yet experienced the full impact of smoking on women's health...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Smoking</b> <b>kills</b> 900, 000 {{people every}} year in India. Many {{studies have shown that}} {{counseling}} from a health profes-sional is an effective method of helping patients quit. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of dental students in Karnataka, India, towards smoking cessation counseling. A questionnaire study was conducted among a convenience sample of 329 dental students comprised of III year and IV year students and interns in three dental colleges in Karnataka, India. Of the 329 students who completed the questionnaire, twenty-two (7 percent) were current smokers, and fifteen (5 percent) were ex-smokers. Although 94 percent responded they were giving antismoking advice to their patients, only 47 percent said they had been taught antismoking advice suitable for patients. While a majority (95 percent) planned to advise patients about tobacco use in their professional careers, significantly fewer (66 percent) indicated that such counseling would help patients to quit. This study of dental students and interns found that a majority intended to provide smoking cessation counseling in their professional career and agreed it is part of their professional role...|$|E
