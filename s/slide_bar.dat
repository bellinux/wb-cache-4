5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Dirty Little Girl" [...] premiered on MTV on February 25, 2009. It was filmed on November 19, 2008 at The <b>Slide</b> <b>Bar</b> in Fullerton, California.|$|E
50|$|When {{still life}} scenes are stereographed, an {{ordinary}} single lens camera {{can be moved}} using a <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> or similar method to generate a stereo pair. Multiple views can be taken and the best pair selected for the desired viewing method.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a new suction tube for microsurgical procedures which permit a precise {{control of the}} pressure of suction. The new device consists of a suction tube connected to a laterally placed <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> which progressively opens or closes a leak. The surgeon can readily adjust the suction pressure by moving slightly the <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> with his thumb or index!nger up and down almost instantaneously...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{technical}} {{factors such as}} analytical design and virtual prototyping, the simple but representative <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> was chosen in this paper and its mathematical model of working contour was established by using the analytic method. And then, the parameterized model and VRML file structural drawing of <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> were given by using double extrusion method. It was proved that {{the components of the}} tripod universal joint were formed easily by using the double extrusion method based on Extrusion nodes. In addition, the tripod universal joint assembly model was also accomplished by using Inline nodes and bottom-up assembling method...|$|R
50|$|The GamerDock app {{allows users}} to {{customize}} a dynamic <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> that controls shortcuts to locations on the Gamerang site, as well as game control functionality on mobile devices such as the iPad or iPhone.|$|R
50|$|Other, vendor-specific {{features}} can {{be implemented}} using standard controls, or combinations of them- for example, the solo bar on a Rock band guitar controller is implemented using the same controller buttons as the main fret buttons, plus an additional modifier key, whereas the <b>Slide</b> <b>Bar</b> from recent versions of Guitar Hero is simply another axis.|$|E
50|$|In a {{double-acting}} steam engine, {{as used in}} {{a railway}} locomotive, {{the direction of the}} vertical thrust on the <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> is always upwards when running forward. It varies from nothing at the end of stroke to a maximum at half stroke when the angle between the con-rod and crank are greatest. When the crank-pin drives the piston, as when coasting, the piston thrust is downwards. The position of maximum thrust is shown by the increased wear at the middle of the slide bars.|$|E
50|$|As for Stephenson's Killingworth {{locomotives}} of {{the year}} before, it had a centre-flue boiler with two vertical cylinders of about 9 × 24 in set into its top centreline. The cylinders drove <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> mounted beams which turned crankshafts driving the axles through 2:1 reduction gears between the frames. It had a tall, tapering chimney, the lower part being surrounded by a feedwater heater. It would have weighed about 7.5 tons and had {{a top speed of}} around 4.5 mph and a load capacity of about 90 tons over a short distance.|$|E
30|$|For ranking {{the results}} of complex {{relationship}} searches on the semantic web, Anyanwu et al. [6] present a flexible approach called SemRank. In this method, {{with the help of}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> user can easily vary their search mode from conventional search mode to discovery search mode.|$|R
25|$|The {{drive was}} on the {{trailing}} wheels and the <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> were attached to a motion bracket just behind the leading wheels. The wheels themselves had twelve spokes and very large balance weights. The front pair of wheels of the engine were partially enclosed in splashers which did not come above the running plate.|$|R
25|$|A {{minor change}} to the {{appearance}} of the streamlining was the removal of the locomotives' solid cowcatcher and its replacement with a lattice type, after it was discovered that the original design created a partial vacuum behind the cowcatcher, sucking dust and grime into the <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> for the centre cylinder, leading to maintenance problems.|$|R
50|$|On October 25, 2013 a free-to-play {{spin-off}} mobile {{game called}} Blur Overdrive {{was released on}} Android, developed by Nottingham based App Crowd, and distributed by Marmalade, who licensed the Blur brand from Activision. An iOS version was released on November 1, 2013. Blur: Overdrive uses a top-down perspective and features eight different power-ups and six cars, which can be upgraded individually in ten steps. Touchscreen controls allow to choose from a floating steering wheel, a <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> or a virtual pad. Player mods and Power Up mods are not connected to the car upgrading system and change how power-ups influence the combat.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrument}} was custom-built at Tanner's request. Tanner appreciated the theremin's sound, but wanted greater control of pitch and attack. The Electro-Theremin uses mechanical controls, a long <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> for the pitch (analogous to the slide of the trombone that was Tanner's main instrument) and a knob to adjust volume. This {{contrasts with the}} hand movements in space that formed the original theremin's signal feature. The Electro-Theremin also produces a slightly less complex timbre than the original. This is not {{due to the nature}} of the instrument, but due to Dr. Theremin's intentional harmonic generation in the output of the Theremin, which Tanner did not do.|$|E
50|$|Sense Field reunited for a Revelation Records 25 Year Anniversary Show on Thursday, June 7, 2012 at The Glass House in Pomona, California. As a warm {{up to that}} show, {{they played}} The <b>Slide</b> <b>Bar</b> in Fullerton, California on Wednesday, June 6, 2012. They also played the Rev 25 show in Chicago on January 6, 2013. All three shows {{featured}} mostly original members, except filling in on bass for John Stockberger was Ian Fowles, who also toured the U.S. filling in on guitar for Rodney Sellars in 2003 while supporting Living Outside. The band reunited twice more: March 20, 2016 at The Yost in Orange County and June 25, 2016 at The TLA in Philadelphia, with both shows serving as fundraisers for Jon Bunch's son, Jack.|$|E

50|$|A {{search of}} the track along which the express had {{travelled}} revealed that between 33 miles and 12 miles before the accident it had shed various components of its side assembly. At {{the point where the}} driver inspected the locomotive all the parts that were missing had already fallen off, but due to the severity of the weather during this inspection the official report did not attach any blame to the driver for not spotting this, although the report did comment that the driver proceeded afterwards at an unsafe speed. Eventually the entire connecting rod had ploughed into the ballast near the adjacent line; wrecking the track in front of the oncoming goods train. The root cause was the failure of maintenance staff to properly secure the <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> nuts; a problem which had been reported several times previously on that locomotive and on others in the same class but without fatal consequences. As a result of the enquiry the difficult to access nuts were redesigned.|$|E
50|$|Despite the locomotives' speed, the 4-2-2 {{design was}} soon {{found to be}} {{outdated}} and unsuitable for more modern operation. A proposal to improve their performance by fitting them with long-travel valves {{was found to be}} impracticable; the existing valves were directly driven from eccentrics mounted on the driving axle, and there was insufficient clearance to fit larger eccentrics. Churchward considered rebuilding the class as Armstrong Class 4-4-0s with7 ft coupled wheels. The cylinder centre line would then be 3.5 in above the driving centre, due to the 7 in difference in driving wheel diameter. This scheme was not carried through because the connecting rods would not clear the lower <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> and the valve gear would be out of alignment. An alternative proposal to drop the locomotive 3.5 in, and raise the buffer beam and dragbox, was also rejected on the grounds of cost. The class were gradually withdrawn between 1908 and 1915, with the last survivor, no. 3074 Princess Helena, being withdrawn in December 1916.|$|E
5000|$|In 1985, Brown {{created a}} new type of double-neck guitar, with some {{assistance}} from Michael Stevens. Brown called the instrument his [...] "guit-steel". When performing, Brown plays the guitar by standing behind it, while it rests on a small music stand. The top neck on the guit-steel is a traditional six-string guitar, while the lower neck is a full-size lap steel guitar for slide playing. Brown has two guit-steels for recording and live work. The original instrument, dubbed [...] "Old Yeller", has as its standard six-string guitar portion the neck and pickups from Brown's previous stage guitar, a Fender Bullet. The second guit-steel, named [...] "Big Red", has a neck laser-copied from the Bullet neck; but in addition to electric guitar pickups, both the standard and lap-steel necks use identical Sho-Bud lap-steel pickups. There is a pocket in the upper bout of the guitar to hold the <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> when it is not in use. Brown also commissioned a [...] "pedal guit-steel" [...] which adds pedals to the instrument for more musical control. Brown has stated that the invention of the guit-steel was always a matter of convenience so that he could play both lap steel and lead guitar during live performances and not directly motivated by a desire to be a [...] "one man band."Brown quickly became a local success in Austin, Texas, as the house band at the Continental Club. His debut album was 1990's 12 Shades of Brown, released by the British Demon Records; it was re-released in 1993 on Curb Records in the U.S., followed by Guit with It. In 1995, Brown released Semi Crazy, and followed it with 1997's Long Walk Back.|$|E

5000|$|The {{locomotive}} had flat [...] "D" [...] type sliding valves {{which were}} actuated by Heusinger valve gear, with Laird type crossheads with single <b>slide</b> <b>bars.</b> To protect the motion from wind-blown {{sand in the}} Namib Desert, it had plate shields arranged along {{the full length of}} the engine, hinged on the running board to allow access to the motion.|$|R
50|$|An {{approach}} to slide guitar {{that does not}} use a bottleneck worn over a finger {{is to use the}} index and middle fingers to hold a weighted lighter (sold as the fireslide) against the strings. The middle, fourth and fifth fingers are used to fret between the slide and the bridge, allowing the player to perform <b>sliding</b> <b>barred</b> chords and scales.|$|R

30|$|The buccal segment model {{consisted}} of five (from the second premolar {{to the central}} incisor) monocrystalline ceramic brackets [11]. The interbracket distance was set at 8.5 mm. The canine bracket was welded to a <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> that allowed different vertical positions, while the other brackets were mounted on a vice-like device. A section of a 0.0215 × 0.028 -in. stainless steel wire was used to align all the brackets.|$|R

40|$|Thinking {{processes}} and interest {{may be related}} to a track of eye. Moreover, the track of eye can be used also for detecting the indecision behind a final reply to a query. Therefore, taking decision making on WEB survey as an example, the decision making mechanism under the network environment was investigated by observing the track of eye. A correlation between a track of eye and the track of mouse was also estimated to investigate a relation between a track of mouse and a mentality on decision making.

30|$|Approximately 5  mL culture broth was sprayed rapidly {{into the}} 25  mL precooled {{quenching}} solution, vortexed and instantaneous weighed {{to estimate the}} exact volume of the sample. The resulting mixture was then immediately transferred into the FiltRes-device for filtration (vacuum already applied, <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> in opened position). After the filtration was finished, the <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> was closed. To test the influence of washing steps, the mycelial filter cake was then additionally washed 1 – 3 times with 25  mL cold (− 40  °C) quenching solution. Afterwards, the extraction solution was injected as follows. The septa of the injection port were pierced with the canule of the dispenser and 16.5  mL of hot extraction solution was rapidly injected. The injection of the extraction solution from below the filter net forced the mycelial filter cake to completely detach from the nylon filter net (detached filter cake see Fig.  4). This exchange of the quenching and extraction solutions was performed within a few seconds as illustrated in Additional file 2 : Movie S 1, where {{the handling of the}} FiltRes-device was demonstrated with a preculture mycelium. In the next step, the FiltRes-device was tilted to transfer the extraction broth into pre-weighed polypropylene or polycarbonate tube with screw caps (50  mL, Nalgene, UK; preheated in a water bath at 90  °C). Due to the device’s dead-volume (extraction solution below the filter), some of the injected extraction solution (1 – 2  mL) could not be transferred into the extraction tubes. This proportion of extraction solution, however, never came into direct contact with the mycelial cake as it remained below the filter disk. Even if metabolites had diffused into this dead volume, the determined intracellular metabolite concentration would have been only minimally distorted. This shortcoming will be eliminated in future prototypes. In any case, to guarantee similar volumetric extraction conditions, the volume transferred from the FiltRes-device to the preheated test tube was determined by weighing and, if necessary, compensated with hot extraction solution. Afterwards, the samples were placed into a shaking water bath at 90  °C and extracted as described later. Since these extracts were subsequently evaporated and resuspended in a defined volume of buffer, the compensation with hot extraction solution had no dilution effect. Concentrations of intracellular nucleotides were normalized to biomass (“Calculations and data analysis” section).|$|E
40|$|The Topdown System is a shell {{for use in}} {{developing}} simple (but we believe non-trivial) knowledge-based CAD systems. It provides a data structure, graphics capabilities, a sophisticated user interface, and programming tools for rapid construction of knowledge bases. Implementation is for Macintosh, Macintosh II, IBM PC/AT, PS 12, and Sun workstations. The basic idea is that of top-down design - beginning with a very abstract representation, and elaborating that, in step-by-step fashion, into a complete and detailed representation. The basic operations are real-time parametric variation of designs (using the mouse and <b>slide</b> <b>bar)</b> and substitution of objects. Essentially, then, a knowledge-base in Top down implements a kind of parametric shape grammar.   The main applications of Top down are in introductory teaching of CAD, and (since it provides a very quick and easy way for a user to develop detailed geometric models) to provide a uniform front-end {{for a variety of}} different applications. The shell, and some example knowledge-bases, are publicly available.  This paper discusses the principles of the Top down Shell, the implementation of knowledge bases within it, and a variety of practical design applications...|$|E
