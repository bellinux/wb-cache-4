5|$|Common {{problems}} {{women experience}} post-SCI are pain with intercourse and difficulty achieving orgasm. Around half {{of women with}} SCI are able to reach orgasm, usually when their genitals are stimulated. Some women report the sensation of orgasm to be the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before</b> the injury, and others say the sensation is reduced.|$|E
5|$|The confederacy also {{implemented}} ready-made {{supplies of}} button, {{consisting of the}} U.S. Government stockpiles throughout the war. These consisted of the Enlisted men's coat button, (an eagle with the shield of the U.S., with the olive branch and arrows held in its talons,) and the officer's buttons, (the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before,</b> but the shield {{is replaced by a}} blank shield, with the respective letter for each branch of service, I for infantry, A for artillery, C for cavalry, and D for dragoons).|$|E

5|$|After {{cancelling}} the self-destruct, {{they find}} the Bynars have uploaded massive amounts of information to the Enterprise computers, but {{they are unable to}} decode it. Realizing that Minuet was purposely created by the Bynars as a distraction, Picard and Riker ask the simulation {{about what is going on}} as the ship nears the orbit of Bynar. Minuet explains that a star near the Bynar homeworld had gone supernova, and the EMP it emitted would knock out their computer systems, effectively killing the Bynars. They had used the Enterprise to upload their computer information for safekeeping and then planned to download it back to the Bynar computers after the threat of the EMP had passed. With Data's help, Picard and Riker successfully download the data, and the Bynars recover. They apologize for their actions, having feared that Starfleet would refuse to help, though Picard notes they only had to ask. As the Enterprise returns to Starbase, Riker returns to the holodeck to thank Minuet but finds that without the Bynar data, the simulation has regressed to the expected norm for the holodeck, and while Minuet still exists, she is not the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before.</b> Riker reports to Picard that Minuet is gone.|$|E

25|$|If {{the demand}} decreases, then the {{opposite}} happens: {{a shift of}} the curve to the left. If the demand starts at D2, and decreases to D1, the equilibrium price will decrease, and the equilibrium quantity will also decrease. The quantity supplied at each price is the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before</b> the demand shift, reflecting {{the fact that the}} supply curve has not shifted; but the equilibrium quantity and price are different {{as a result of the}} change (shift) in demand.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Wu {{knew that}} Sima Zhong had {{developmental}} disability so he became worried {{that his son}} would bring disaster upon the Jin dynasty. He ordered Xun Xu and He Jiao (和嶠) to observe and evaluate Sima Zhong. Xun Xu praised Sima Zhong for being a virtuous crown prince, while He Jiao said that Sima Zhong was the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before.</b> He Jiao became respected for being honest about Sima Zhong, whereas Xun Xu was derided for lying in order to please the emperor.|$|E
25|$|Fenton's ships {{stayed at}} São Vicente {{for only the}} rest of the day trying to at least to do some trade but the Portuguese answer was the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before.</b> Fenton fearing more Spanish ships then moved off to Espirito Santo where news of the battle had been {{received}} but with mixed feelings with the populace; trade was again refused. Disappointed; Fenton realized that trade with the Portuguese here was at an end. With supplies running low and quarrels with Hawkins decided to sail for England.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} of the air arm within the Department of War remained essentially the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before,</b> that is, the flying units were under the operational control of the various ground forces corps area commands and not the Air Corps, which remained responsible for procurement and maintenance of aircraft, supply, and training. Because {{of a lack of}} legally specified duties and responsibilities, the new {{position of}} Assistant Secretary of War for Air, held by F. Trubee Davison from July 1926 to March 1933, proved of little help in promoting autonomy for the air arm.|$|E
25|$|The two teams' total ratings {{is almost}} exactly the same after the series (119.4+90.5=209.9) as before the series (120+90=210). The series has {{therefore}} not generated any extra ratings, but has just redistributed the ratings the two teams already had. When these ratings are published in the official table in their rounded form (119 and 91), the total ratings after the series will be exactly the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before</b> the series. There is therefore no points 'inflation' in this system, which means that comparisons of ratings over time are meaningful.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules and}} {{gameplay}} were the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before,</b> including the Star Wheel Bonus, but the format was altered slightly. Each contestant on {{this version of}} Match Game played a two-game match against another contestant, and the Super Match was played after each game. As on Match Game PM, a contestant did not win any money for winning the game. There were also no returning champions on the daily syndicated series, as two new contestants began each match. The Star Wheel reduced the golden star sections to three, {{making it more difficult}} to double the winnings in the Head-to-Head match.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, FedEx built a $300 million mid-Atlantic air-cargo and sorting hub at Piedmont Triad International Airport, {{following}} an intensive {{competition for the}} hub among {{other regions of the}} state, as well as locations in South Carolina. The project was challenged in court based on the quality of planned noise and pollution abatements from neighborhoods near the planned hub site. The hub opened in 2009. Originally projected by FedEx to employ 750 people in its first two years of operation and eventually 1,500, local FedEx employment has been nearly the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before</b> the facility was constructed.|$|E
25|$|Up until 2011, {{trading hours}} {{comprised}} a pre-opening auction from 9:30 AM to 9:50 AM, followed by continuous trading from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM and 2:30 PM to 4:00 PM. The two-hour lunch break between {{the morning and}} afternoon sessions was the longest among the world's 20 major stock exchanges. A 2003 proposal to shorten the lunch break failed due to opposition from brokers. Another plan to shorten the lunch break to one hour was floated by the exchange in 2010; the morning session would then start earlier, run from 9:30am to 12:00pm, and the afternoon session from 1:00pm to 4:00pm, leaving the closing time the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before.</b> Justifications included bringing hours into line with China. Reactions from both brokers and the restaurant industry were mixed.|$|E
25|$|The {{austerity}} program {{started in}} 1981 and the widespread poverty it introduced made the Communist regime very unpopular. The austerity programs {{were met with}} little resistance among Romanians and {{there were only a}} few strikes and labor disputes, of which the Jiu Valley miners' strike of 1977 and the Brașov Rebellion of November 1987 at the truck manufacturer Steagul Roșu were the most notable. In March 1989 several leading activists of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) criticised Ceaușescu's economic policies in a letter, but shortly thereafter he achieved a significant political victory: Romania paid off its external debt of about US $11 billion several months before the time that even the Romanian dictator expected. However, in months following the announcement austerity and a shortage of goods remained the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

500|$|Scholars have {{subjected}} this poem, Narihira's most famous, {{to several}} conflicting interpretations in recent centuries. The Edo-period kokugaku scholar Motoori Norinaga interpreted {{the first part}} of it as a pair of rhetorical questions, marked by the particle ya. He explained away the logical inconsistency with {{the latter part of the}} poem that his reading introduced by reading in an [...] "implied" [...] conclusion that though the poet remains the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before,</b> everything somehow feels different. The late-Edo period waka poet [...] took a different view, interpreting the [...] as exclamatory: the moon and spring are not those of before, and only the poet himself remains unchanged.|$|E
500|$|Because Eris {{appeared}} to be larger than Pluto, NASA initially described it as the Solar System's tenth planet. This, along {{with the prospect of}} other objects of similar size being discovered in the future, motivated the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to define the term planet for the first time. Under the IAU definition approved on August 24, 2006, Eris is a [...] "dwarf planet", along with objects such as Pluto, Ceres, Haumea and Makemake, thereby reducing the number of known planets in the Solar System to eight, the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before</b> Pluto's discovery in 1930. Observations of a stellar occultation by Eris in 2010 showed that its diameter was , very slightly less than Pluto, which was measured by New Horizons as [...] in July 2015.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea was}} {{ultimately}} scrapped, {{as it turned}} out such a guarantee would be highly expensive; the insurance company believed that there would be difficulty in proving that the hair grew back exactly the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>before.</b> Instead, Khambatta visited the Georgette Klinger Skin Care Salon in Beverly Hills, where experts recommended that she receive six facials and scalp treatments during the course of production. The salon also prescribed a daily scalp treatment routine of cleansing bars, brilliantine lotion, conditioner, makeup remover, and cleansing lotion. The studio agreed these measures were necessary and footed the bill while Khambatta spent six months following the tedious instructions (her hair eventually regrew without issue, though she kept her shaven locks after production had ended.) ...|$|E
