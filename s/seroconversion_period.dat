40|$|OBJECTIVES. This study {{sought to}} examine risk factors {{associated}} with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) seroconversion among active-duty men in the US Army. METHODS. One hundred twenty-eight men with documented HIV- 1 seroconversion between 1988 and 1991 were matched to control subjects on demographic variables. Risk factor information was collected for the <b>seroconversion</b> <b>period.</b> RESULTS. Forty-nine case subjects and no control subjects reported same-gender sex; this includes 34 case subjects who also reported sex with women. Seventy case and 118 control subjects reported no risk factors other than heterosexual intercourse. Among heterosexuals, excess risk was noted for men who had sex with women in risk categories defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (odds ratio = 10. 0; 95 % confidence interval = 1. 3, 78. 1). Significant trends of increasing risk for seroconversion were found with increasing numbers of female partners, nonsteady partners, and partners with whom sex occurred {{on the first day}} of acquaintance. CONCLUSIONS. In this population, the major risk factor for HIV- 1 seroconversion was same-gender sex. Among heterosexuals, sex with anonymous or causal partners increased this risk. Intervention programs should emphasize the risk of indiscriminate partner selection in addition to "safe sex" practices...|$|E
40|$|Although {{individuals}} {{infected with}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) {{seem to be more}} infectious in the late stages of HIV infection and possibly also during the <b>seroconversion</b> <b>period,</b> most estimates of per-sexual-contact infectivity have been obtained without allowing for variability over the course of infection. In this analysis, a probabilistic model was fitted to data from a European study carried out between 1987 and 1992 that involved 499 (359 males and 140 females) HIV-infected subjects (index cases) and their regular hetero-sexual partners. The model used allowed infectivity (the per-sexual-contact HIV transmission probability, n) to vary through three stages: the first 3 months following infection, the subsequent asymptomatic period, and the advanced stage (HIV-related clinical symptoms or a CD 4 -positive T lymphocyte count less than 200 /mm 3). Male-to-female infectivity through penile-anal sex was found to be higher in both the early and advanced stages of infection (^ = 0. 183) than in the longer intermediate period (/x = 0. 014) (p < 0. 03). Failure to demonstrate significant differences between stages for other types of contact (male-to-female penile-vaginal contacts: /x = 0. 0007; female-to-male transmission: ju, = 0. 0005) may reflect insufficient power rather than a true lack of variability. Indeed, the results for penile-anal sex suggest that persons who {{are in the process of}} seroconverting may be much more infectious than asymptomatic infected persons, whatever the type of contact. Prevention education should stress the risk of HIV transmission from subjects who may be unawar...|$|E

The introduction of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) has improved the immune function of these patients by modifying the course of B 19 V infection. The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate the frequency of B 19 seroconversion in a cohort of HIV-infected patients and evaluate the occurrence of B 19 V-related anaemia during the <b>seroconversion</b> <b>period.</b> Adult HIV-infected patients were studied at a public hospital in Niterói, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. IgG and IgM antibodies against B 19 V were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and B 19 viraemia was assayed by polymerase chain reaction. Medical records were reviewed for any clinical evaluation of anaemia. Seroconversion was detected in 31. 8 % of the 88 individuals who began the study as anti-B 19 V IgG-negative. No clinical manifestations of B 19 V infection were detected during the period of seroconversion. Patients who seroconverted were 5. 40 times more likely to have anaemia than those who did not [odds ratio 5. 40 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 33 - 22. 93) ]. Anaemia was detected in eight patients. All patients recovered from anaemia by either beginning or continuing HAART, without requiring blood transfusions. In the HAART era, B 19 V infection may only be associated with a course of disease characterised by less severe chronic anaemia. This milder course of B 19 V-associated disease is likely due to the increased immune function of HAART-treated patients...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infection}} is the 10 th {{leading cause of}} death worldwide. The most important diagnostic and screening marker for HBV {{infection is}} Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and the most widely used HBsAg screening test is Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). In this study, an ELISA assay has been developed for detection of HBsAg using two novel monoclonal antibodies (mAb) as capture layer and a polyclonal biotinylated Ab as detector phase. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, detection limit, seroconversion time, positive and negative predictive values and reproducibility of our assay with standard panels and different serum samples. The results were compared with a well established commercial kit. Both assays showed similar detection limit values of 0. 5 to 0. 7 ng/ml and the same <b>seroconversion</b> <b>periods</b> of 42 and 65 days for "ad" and "ay" serotypes of HBsAg, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 98. 98 % and 99. 6 %, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of our assay were also calculated as 99. 49 % and 99. 2 %, respectively. Analysis of reproducibility of the present assay demonstrated 3. 96 % and 5. 85 % intra-and inter-assay coefficient of variations, respectively, which were less than those obtained by the commercial kit. There was a highly significant correlation between our designed assay and the commercial ELISA kit (p < 0. 0001, r = 0. 957). Altogether, our results indicate that the designed assay is comparable to the commercial kit in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and reproducibility and could be employed for diagnosis of HBV infection in blood samples.

40|$|See the {{editorial}} commentary by Srikantiah et al., on pages 147 – 9.) Background. Infection with human immuodeficiency virus (HIV) {{increases the risk}} of tuberculosis (TB), but no study has assessed how this risk changes with time since HIV seroconversion. Methods. The incidence of pulmonary TB was estimated in miners with and those without HIV infection in a retrospective cohort study. HIV test results were linked to routinely collected TB, demographic, and occupational data. The rate ratio (RR) for the association between HIV status and TB was estimated by time since HIV se-roconversion, calendar period, and age. Results. Of the 23, 874 miners in the cohort, 17, 766 were HIV negative on entry, 3371 were HIV positive on entry, and 2737 seroconverted during follow-up (1962 had a seroconversion interval of 2 years). A total of 740 cases of TB were analyzed. The incidence of TB increased with time since <b>seroconversion,</b> calendar <b>period,</b> and age. TB incidence was 2. 90 cases/ 100 person-years at risk (pyar) in HIV-positive miners and was 0. 80 cases/ 100 pyar in HIV-negative miners (adjusted RR, 2. 9 [95 % confidence interval {CI}, 2. 5 – 3. 4]). TB incidence doubled within the first year of HIV infection (adjusted RR, 2. 1 [95 % CI, 1. 4 – 3. 1]), with a further slight increase in HIV-positive miners for longer periods, up to 7 years. Conclusion. The increase in the risk of TB so soon after infection with HIV was unexpected. Current predictiv...|$|R

The {{literature}} contains few {{longitudinal studies}} that have assessed areas endemic for canine leishmaniasis and over the same time interval Leishmania-specific cellular and humoral immunity in healthy dogs. Fourteen dogs, three mixed breed and 11 Ibizian hounds, living {{in an area of}} Spain that was highly endemic for leishmaniasis were followed-up over a three-year period by serologic analysis and the leishmanin skin test (LST). All but one of these dogs remained clinically healthy during the study <b>period.</b> <b>Seroconversion</b> was observed in four dogs. The three mixed breed dogs had a negative reaction in the LST in the first and third years. The general trend in the Ibizian hounds was an increase in the diameter of the LST reaction at both the 48 - and 72 -hour readings in the third year. This study demonstrates that in addition to an increase in Leishmania-specific humoral immune response in Ibizian hounds, a parallel increase in cellular immune response was observed...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} HIV prevention programmes {{and knowledge}} of people dying of AIDS, people in Zimbabwe continue to be infected with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This paper presents selected case histories from interviews with 57 men who became HIV positive during follow up of 1678 seronegative male factory workers in Harare, and describes {{the circumstances in which}} they were exposed to infection. Youth was a major risk factor, with 47 % of those who seroconverted aged between 18 and 24 Â yr. STIs were reported by 23 % of the group in the <b>seroconversion</b> <b>period,</b> a marker of unprotected sex. Individuals did not recognise themselves or their partners as candidates for infection because of categorisation of high risk groups as "promiscuous" or clients of sex workers. Many were optimistic that they had changed sufficiently by using condoms more often or by avoiding sex workers. They made inaccurate assessments of who was safe for unprotected sex, based on judgements about their character, background and age. Over 40 % of the seroconvertors had previously been counselled on staying HIV negative. Community approaches which nurture development of supportive group norms, respect for human rights and responsibilities, and safe environments for disclosure of HIV status, are vital for overcoming denial of risk at individual and societal levels. Special efforts targeted at youth are crucial since they have the highest risk of new infections and include use of media, drama, role models, advisory centres, peer education programmes. Health professionals need training and skills to enable people at risk of HIV infection to devise strategies based on more realistic personal risk assessment. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether certain {{sexually transmitted diseases}} are independent risk factors for HIV transmission in a cohort of homosexual men. METHODS [...] Eligible cases were identified as those who had seroconverted between November 1982 and November 1990. Two persistently HIV-seronegative control participants were randomly selected for each case from all participants who remained seronegative in November 1990. For cases, risk factor data were taken from an index visit which {{was defined as the}} first seropositive visit, while for controls these data were obtained from a matched visit which occurred within two months of the index visit for the corresponding case. Mantel-Haenszel methods and logistic regression were used to compare differences in risk factors for seroconversion between cases and controls. RESULTS [...] A total of 125 cases and 250 controls were eligible for this study. Cases {{were significantly more likely to}} have had reported any gonorrhoea (17 % versus 6 %; OR = 2. 94; 95 % CI: 1. 51 - 5. 73) or syphilis (7 % versus 2 %; OR = 3. 78; 95 % CI: 1. 33 - 10. 79) than controls during the <b>seroconversion</b> <b>period.</b> Multivariate logistic regression revealed rectal gonorrhoea to be independently associated with risk of seroconversion (odds ratio = 3. 18; p = 0. 044), whereas urethral gonorrhoea (p = 0. 479) and pharyngeal gonorrhoea (p = 0. 434) were not after inclusion of rectal gonorrhoea. In addition, the following variables were also shown to exert an independent effect on seroconversion: frequency of anal intercourse, use of illicit drugs, number of male sexual partners, and lack of a post-secondary education. CONCLUSIONS [...] In this observational study, rectal gonorrhoea was found to be associated with HIV seroconversion after adjustment for a number of HIV risk factors. We cannot rule out that rectal gonorrhoea was not directly associated with HIV infection but rather with other residual lifestyle factors not fully adjusted for in the analysis. However, the relationship with gonococcal involvement of a specific anatomic site lends support to a biological association between gonorrhoea and HIV infection, rather than to alternative non-biologic explanations. Our findings are consistent with previous studies reporting an association between HIV infection and non-ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases. Such a direct association might be explained by postulating that gonorrhoea results in inflamed rectal mucosa and compromised epithelial integrity, thereby predisposing an individual to subsequent HIV infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} several techniques currently available (commercial kits and in-house assays) for diagnosing human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 in {{two groups of}} patients enrolled at HIV/AIDS specialized care services in São Paulo: Group 1 (G 1), n =  1608, 1237 male/ 371 female, median age 44. 3 years old, majority using {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART); G 2, n =  1383, 930 male/ 453 female, median age of 35. 6 years old, majority HAART naïve. Enzyme immunoassays [(EIA) Murex and Gold ELISA] were employed for human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 screening; Western blotting (WB), INNO-LIA (LIA), real-time PCR pol (qPCR), and nested-PCR-RFLP (tax) were used to confirm infection. Samples were considered human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 positive when there was reactivity using {{at least one of the}} four confirmatory assays. By serological screening, 127 / 2991 samples were positive or borderline, and human T lymphotropic virus infection was confirmed in 108 samples (three EIA-borderline) : 56 human T lymphotropic virus type 1 [G 1 (27)  + G 2 (29) ]; 45 human T lymphotropic virus type 2 [G 1 (21)  + G 2 (24) ]; one human T lymphotropic virus type 1  + human T lymphotropic virus type 2 (G 2); six human T lymphotropic virus [G 1 (2)  + G 2 (4) ]. Although there were differences in group characteristics, human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 prevalence was similar [3. 1 % (G 1) and 4. 2 % (G 2), p =  0. 113]. The overall sensitivities of LIA, WB, qPCR, and PCR-RFLP were 97. 2 %, 82. 4 %, 68. 9 %, and 68. 4 %, respectively, with some differences among groups, likely due to the stage of human T lymphotropic virus infection and/or HAART duration. Indeterminate immunoblotting results were detected in G 2, possibly due to the <b>seroconversion</b> <b>period.</b> Negative results in molecular assays could be explained by the use of HAART, the occurrence of defective provirus and/or the low circulating proviral load. In conclusion, when determining the human T lymphotropic virus infection, the findings highlight that there is a need to consider the blood samples with borderline results in screening assays. Of all the tested assays, LIA was the assay of choice for detecting human T lymphotropic virus type 1 and human T lymphotropic virus type 2 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 -infected patients...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To analyse {{the effect}} of {{educational}} level on the progression from HIV seroconversion to {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) requirement, HAART initiation, AIDS and death from any cause at different periods of the HIV epidemic in Spain. Methods Open, prospective, multicentre cohort of HIV seroconverters set up in 1983. The risk of progression was calculated by the multiple decrements method. Effect of educational level was estimated by Fine and Gray model, adjusting for sex, HIV transmission category, age and method to estimate <b>seroconversion.</b> Calendar <b>period</b> was introduced as a variable that could change over time ( 2003). Results Up to 2009, 989 HIV seroconverters with information on educational level were identified. Some 52 % and 48 % had a low and a high educational level respectively. Persons with higher education had 32 % lower risk of death (HR: 0. 68; 95 % CI 0. 45 to 1. 03). Regarding progression to AIDS, educational level had no effect in the pre-HAART era (HR: 1. 47; 95 % CI 0. 91 to 2. 38), but did show an effect in the period 1997 e 2003 (HR: 0. 58; 95 % CI 0. 34 to 0. 99), which was accentuated after 2004 (HR: 0. 26; 95 % CI 0. 10 to 0. 68). No difference was found in time to HAART requirement or initiation. Conclusions Results suggest that, despite similar access to HAART, persons with low educational level are at increased risk of HIV disease progression, highlighting the impact of social inequities on health. The availability of more effective treatments over time will strengthen the protective effect of higher education on the development of AIDS...|$|R
40|$|The {{landmark}} HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 052 {{trial in}} HIV-discordant couples demonstrated unequivocally that treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) substantially lowers {{the probability of}} HIV transmission to the HIV-uninfected partner. However, it has been vigorously debated whether substantial population-level reductions {{in the rate of}} new HIV infections could be achieved in "real-world" sub-Saharan African settings where stable, cohabiting couples are often not the norm and where considerable operational challenges exist to the successful and sustainable delivery of treatment and care to large numbers of patients. We used data from one of Africa's largest population-based prospective cohort studies (in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) to follow up a total of 16, 667 individuals who were HIV-uninfected at baseline, observing individual HIV <b>seroconversions</b> over the <b>period</b> 2004 to 2011. Holding other key HIV risk factors constant, individual HIV acquisition risk declined significantly with increasing ART coverage in the surrounding local community.

40|$|To {{understand}} the high variability of the asymptomatic interval between primary {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) infection {{and the development of}} AIDS, we studied the evolution of the C 2 -V 5 region of the HIV- 1 env gene and of T-cell subsets in nine men with a moderate or slow rate of disease progression. They were monitored from the time of <b>seroconversion</b> for a <b>period</b> of 6 to 12 years until the development of advanced disease in seven men. Based on the analysis of viral divergence from the founder strain, viral population diversity within sequential time points, and the outgrowth of viruses capable of utilizing the CXCR 4 receptor (X 4 viruses), the existence of three distinct phases within the asymptomatic interval is suggested: an early phase of variable duration during which linear increases (; 1 % per year) in both divergence and diversity were observed; an intermediate phase lasting an average of 1. 8 years, characterized by a continued increase in divergence but with stabilization or decline in diversity; and a late phase characterized by a slowdown or stabilization of divergence and continued stability or decline in diversity. X 4 variants emerged {{around the time of the}} early- to intermediate-phase transition and then achieved peak representation and began a decline around the transition between the intermediate and late phases. The late-phase transition was also associated with failure of T-cell homeostasis (defined by a downward inflection in CD 31 T cells) and decline of CD 41...|$|R

La implementación de dicha determinación en el banco de sangre de la Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (UNC) implicó un costo elevado para el nulo beneficio obtenido. Se evaluó la eficiencia del ensayo combinado Ag/Ac ELISA de 4 ta generación para el {{screening}} de HIV, en comparación a la estrategia actualmente utilizada en el banco de sangre de la UNC (ELISA 3 ra generación + ELISA Ag p 24). Se utilizaron 11 muestras de suero de pacientes infectados con HIV en etapa temprana de seroconversión, 27 muestras de suero de individuos infectados en etapa asintomática de la infección y 39 muestras de suero de individuos no infectados. Se demostró igual sensibilidad (100 %) y una especificidad menor para el equipo de 4 ta generación (95. 1 %) frente al equipo de 3 ra generación (97. 5 %). El ensayo de Ag p 24 falló en la detección de 2 muestras HIV tempranas. La alta sensibilidad y especificidad demostradas por los equipos de 3 ra y 4 ta generación, indica que ambos son adecuados para el tamizaje de HIV en bancos de sangre. Sin embargo, el ELISA de 4 ta generación podría ser implementado en los bancos de sangre regionales como una alternativa de menor costo a la estrategia actualmente utilizada. Esta alternativa resulta viable hasta tanto sea posible incorporar en los bancos de sangre la detección de ARN de HIV por técnicas moleculares.

In the blood bank of the National University of Cordoba (Argentina), the recent implementation of the p 24 Ag screening test has considerably increased {{the cost of the}} battery of screening tests and its use in all blood donations has not produced the benefits expected. A 4 th generation EIA was evaluated for the screening of HIV in comparison with the currently used assays in the blood bank of National University of Cordoba (3 rd generation EIA + p 24 Ag assay). For this comparison, 11 serum samples from subjects with early HIV infection (early <b>seroconversion</b> <b>period)</b> were tested, as well as 27 serum samples from asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects and other 39 from non-HIV infected subjects. The 3 rd generation EIA and the 4 th generation EIA showed the same sensitivity value (100 %) but the specificity of the 3 rd generation EIA was higher (97. 5 %) comparing with 4 th generation (95. 1 %). Besides, the p 24 Ag test failed to detect 2 samples from subjects with early HIV infection. These results indicate a good performance of both 3 rd and 4 th generation assays for screening of HIV. However, due to the lowest cost of 4 th generation EIA kit, it could replace the currently used assays for HIV screening in regional blood banks.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Public Health)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Health Sciences, 2012. Measuring HIV {{incidence}} {{has proved}} challenging over the years. A number of serological HIV assays have been proposed, and among these, the BED Capture Enzyme Immunoassay (CEIA) {{is one of}} the more widely used. Although the assay performs well among known seroconverting panels, it has been shown to classify some long term infected patients as being recently infected. Information on the performance of the BED assay among low CD 4 cell count patients and those on antiretroviral therapy is limited. The risk of onwards transmission of HIV has been reported to be elevated around the <b>seroconversion</b> <b>period</b> compared to the chronic stage of infection. RNA viral load has been reported as the strongest predictor of HIV transmission compared to other HIV markers. Understanding how these markers influence the relationship between the likelihood of being recently infected and the BED assay might help in understanding some of the shortcomings of the BED assay. The main aim of this study was to understand the properties of the BED assay. The performance of the BED assay among advanced HIV disease patients and the influence of ART on BED levels once patients started treatment was investigated. The BED assay and CD 4 cell count were used to quantify the risk of in utero and intrapartum transmission to their infants among women believed to have seroconverted during pregnancy. The influence of viral load, haemoglobin and mid-upper arm circumference was investigated on the relationship between the probability of being recently infected and BED ODn levels. Methods Cryopreserved plasma samples from HIV patients on the national antiretroviral treatment (ART) rollout programme at Tygerberg Hospital HIV clinic, South Africa, iv were used to investigate the effect of ART on BED ODn levels once patients commenced treatment. Mixed effect logistic regression models accounting for multiple readings per patient were used. To investigate the risk associated with seroconversion during pregnancy HIV seropositive women who had just given birth were classified into mutually exclusive groups according to their likelihood of having recently seroconverted using BED and CD 4 cell count levels. Multinomial logistic regression models adjusting for other factors were used to assess the risk of MTCT in utero and intra-partum infection comparing these groups. To investigate the relationship between BED ODn levels and the probability of being recently infected, BED data from known HIV infected women and women who seroconverted over a 2 year period was used. Fractional polynomial regression models that allow for non-linear functions to be fitted were used, and the influence of viral load, haemoglobin and mid-upper arm circumference was assessed through multi-variable models. Data from the Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies (ZVITAMBO) project, a double blinded treatment-placebo trial was used for these last two objectives. Results Patients with very low CD 4 cell counts were more likely to test false recently infected according to the BED assay than other patients. ART changed BED ODn kinetics among HIV patients on treatment. Over half of advanced disease stage patients were likely to be classified as being recently infected according to the BED assay 2 years into ART treatment. v Women who seemed to have seroconverted during pregnancy had elevated risk of transmitting HIV in-utero compared to chronic HIV patients. BED and CD 4 cell count were not predictive of risk of intra-partum infections attributed to seroconversion during pregnancy. The relationship between the probability of being recently infected with HIV and BED ODn levels was described better using Fractional Polynomial regression models than using a linear model in BED ODn or a model in which the BED ODn was categorised. Viral load and haemoglobin were important independent predictors of incident infections. Conclusions If the BED assay is to be used for HIV incidence estimations patients on ART should be accounted for. The BED assay together with other HIV serological markers can be used as prognostic tools to assess the risk of HIV transmission. The risk of in-utero transmission of HIV is higher among women who seroconvert during pregnancy. Repeat HIV testing among pregnant women may help in identifying women who seroconvert during pregnancy, and these women will benefit from Prevention of Mother-to-Child transmission (PMTCT) programmes. It was found that additional markers such as viral load and haemoglobin did not alter the relationship between the probability of having been recently infected and BED ODn...|$|E

We conducted a literature review to assess this assertion. The articles that were included in this review reported antibody levels � 4 months after influenza immunization in persons � 60 years old, interpretable {{in the context of}} annual influenza vaccine–approval criteria (seroprotection/seroconversion) specified by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) for the elderly. The final review included 14 studies; 8 of which reported seroprotection rates. Seroprotection exceeding CPMP criteria was maintained � 4 months after influenza immunization in all 8 of the studies reporting this for the H 3 N 2 component and in 5 of the 7 studies reporting this for the H 1 N 1 and B components. In determining whether CPMP criteria were met at season’s end, primary antibody response appeared to be more relevant than secondary antibody decline. Both studies reporting seroprotection rates that failed CPMP criteria � 4 months after influenza immunization for each of the H 1 N 1 and B components had also reported failed seroprotection at 1 month after immunization. If initially achieved after immunization, seroprotection rates of 70 %– 100 % were maintained not just at 4 months (2 studies) but also at 5 months (2 studies) and even at> 6 months (4 studies), for the H 3 N 2 and H 1 N 1 vaccine components.

40|$|Background: Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a {{neglected}} tropical disease that afflicts {{some of the}} poorest populations in the world including {{people living in the}} Bihar state of India. Due to efforts from local governments, NGOs and international organizations, the number of VL cases has declined in recent years. Despite this progress, the reservoir for transmission remains to be clearly defined since it is unknown what role post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) and asymptomatic infections play in transmission. This information is vital to establish effective surveillance and monitoring to sustainably eliminate VL. Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed a longitudinal study over a 24 -month period to examine VL transmission and seroconversion in households with VL, PKDL and asymptomatic infections in the Saran and Muzaffarpur districts of Bihar. During the initial screening of 5, 144 people in 16 highly endemic villages, 195 cases of recently treated VL, 116 healthy rK 39 positive cases and 31 PKDL cases were identified. Approximately half of the rK 39 -positive healthy cases identified during the initial 6 -month screening period were from households (HHs) where a VL case had been identified. During the 18 -month follow-up <b>period,</b> <b>seroconversion</b> of family members in the HHs with VL cases, PKDL cases, and rK 39 -positive individuals was similar to control HHs. Therefore, seroconversion was highest in HHs closest to the time of VL disease of a household member and {{there was no evidence of}} higher transmission in households with PKDL or healthy rK 39 -positive HHs. Moreover, within the PKDL HHs, (the initial 31 PKDL cases plus an additional 66 PKDL cases), there were no cases of VL identified during the initial screen or the 18 -month follow-up.

40|$|Background & Aims Case {{definitions}} {{for recent}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection vary considerably between studies. The {{aim of this}} systematic review was to characterize case definitions for recent HCV and explore the heterogeneity in studies performed to date. Methods A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and ISI Web of Knowledge was performed covering all studies of recent HCV infection cited between January 2000 and June 2011. The criteria used by each study to define cases of recent HCV infection were extracted, structured, and analyzed. Results Overall, 195 articles were included, with 87 % (n = 169) providing a clear case definition for recent HCV infection. The most frequently used individual criteria for defining a case included HCV antibody seroconversion (77 %), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation (68 %), and HCV RNA detection (63 %). In studies using HCV antibody <b>seroconversion,</b> the window <b>period</b> between the last negative and the first positive antibody test varied widely across studies (4 weeks to 4 years). Considerable diversity was also observed {{with respect to the}} ALT threshold used to characterize ALT elevations, ranging from 2 to 20 times the upper limit of normal. HCV antibody seroconversion was used as a single criterion in 41 % of the studies, while all other studies used at least two criteria (range: 2 – 9). Epidemiology/surveillance studies mostly used a more sensitive case definition, whereas treatment studies, natural history studies, and diagnosis studies used more specific case definitions. Conclusions Marked heterogeneity in case definitions for recent HCV infection was observed. Although a single case definition for recent HCV is not warranted, a degree of standardization within specific study categories would enable improved cross-study comparison and more uniform evaluation of HCV prevention and management strategies...|$|R

The most frequently used individual criteria for defining a case included HCV antibody seroconversion (77 %), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation (68 %), and HCV RNA detection (63 %). In studies using HCV antibody <b>seroconversion,</b> the window <b>period</b> between the last negative and the first positive antibody test varied widely across studies (4 weeks to 4 years). Considerable diversity was also observed {{with respect to the}} ALT threshold used to characterize ALT elevations, ranging from 2 to 20 times the upper limit of normal. HCV antibody seroconversion was used as a single criterion in 41 % of the studies, while all other studies used at least two criteria (range: 2 – 9). Epidemiology/surveillance studies mostly used a more sensitive case definition, whereas treatment studies, natural history studies, and diagnosis studies used more specific case definitions. ConclusionsMarked heterogeneity in case definitions for recent HCV infection was observed. Although a single case definition for recent HCV is not warranted, a degree of standardization within specific study categories would enable improved cross-study comparison and more uniform evaluation of HCV prevention and management strategies...|$|R
40|$|Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a {{neglected}} tropical disease that afflicts {{some of the}} poorest populations in the world including {{people living in the}} Bihar state of India. Due to efforts from local governments, NGOs and international organizations, the number of VL cases has declined in recent years. Despite this progress, the reservoir for transmission remains to be clearly defined since it is unknown what role post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) and asymptomatic infections play in transmission. This information is vital to establish effective surveillance and monitoring to sustainably eliminate VL. We performed a longitudinal study over a 24 -month period to examine VL transmission and seroconversion in households with VL, PKDL and asymptomatic infections in the Saran and Muzaffarpur districts of Bihar. During the initial screening of 5, 144 people in 16 highly endemic villages, 195 cases of recently treated VL, 116 healthy rK 39 positive cases and 31 PKDL cases were identified. Approximately half of the rK 39 -positive healthy cases identified during the initial 6 -month screening period were from households (HHs) where a VL case had been identified. During the 18 -month follow-up <b>period,</b> <b>seroconversion</b> of family members in the HHs with VL cases, PKDL cases, and rK 39 -positive individuals was similar to control HHs. Therefore, seroconversion was highest in HHs closest to the time of VL disease of a household member and {{there was no evidence of}} higher transmission in households with PKDL or healthy rK 39 -positive HHs. Moreover, within the PKDL HHs, (the initial 31 PKDL cases plus an additional 66 PKDL cases), there were no cases of VL identified during the initial screen or the 18 -month follow-up. Notably, 23 % of the PKDL cases had no prior history of VL suggesting that infection resulting directly in PKDL is more common than previously estimated. These observations argue that acute VL cases represent the major reservoir for transmission in these villages and early identification and treatment of VL cases should remain a priority for VL elimination. We were unable to obtain evidence that transmission occurs in HHs with a PKDL case...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Human T Lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) subtype C is {{endemic to}} central Australia where {{each of the}} major {{sequelae}} of HTLV- 1 infection has been documented in the socially disadvantaged Indigenous population. Nevertheless, available epidemiological information relating to HTLV- 1 c infection is very limited, risk factors for transmission are unknown and no coordinated program has been implemented to reduce transmission among Indigenous Australians. Identifying risk factors for HTLV- 1 infection is essential to direct strategies that could control HTLV- 1 transmission. Risk factors for HTLV- 1 infection were retrospectively determined for a cohort of Indigenous Australians who were tested for HTLV- 1 at Alice Springs Hospital (ASH), 1 st January 2000 to 30 th June 2013. Demographic details {{were obtained from the}} ASH patient management database and the results of tests for sexually transmitted infections (STI) were obtained from the ASH pathology database. Among 1889 Indigenous patients whose HTLV- 1 serostatus was known, 635 (33. 6  %) were HTLV- 1 Western blot positive. Only one of 77 (1. 3  %) children tested was HTLV- 1 infected. Thereafter, rates progressively increased with age (15 - 29 years, 17. 3  %; 30 - 49 years, 36. 2  %; 50 - 64 years, 41. 7  %) reaching 48. 5  % among men aged 50 - 64 years. In a multivariable model, increasing age (OR, 1. 04; 95  % CI, 1. 03 - 1. 04), male gender (OR, 1. 41; 95  % CI, 1. 08 - 1. 85), residence in the south (OR, 10. 7; 95  % CI, 7. 4 - 15. 6) or west (OR, 4. 4; 95  % CI, 3. 1 - 6. 3) of central Australia and previous STI (OR, 1. 42; 95  % CI, 1. 04 - 1. 95) were associated with HTLV- 1 infection. Infection was acquired by three of 351 adults who were tested more than once during the study <b>period</b> (<b>seroconversion</b> rate, 0. 24 (95  % CI[*]=[*] 0. 18 - 2. 48) per 100 person-years). This study confirms that HTLV- 1 is highly endemic to central Australia. Although childhood infection was documented, HTLV- 1 infection in adults was closely associated with increasing age, male gender and STI history. Multiple modes of transmission are therefore likely to contribute to high rates of HTLV- 1 infection in the Indigenous Australian population. Future strategies to control HTLV- 1 transmission in this population require careful community engagement, cultural understanding and Indigenous leadership...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{changes in the}} epidemiological status of Coxiella burnetii in dairy cattle herds {{to better understand the}} epidemiology of the infection and to predict its evolution. Bulk-tank milk (BTM) and serum samples were collected from 94 dairy cattle herds and analyzed by ELISA (BTM and sera) and PCR (BTM) in study 1 (S 1). Two years later (study 2; S 2), the same farms were visited with a similar sampling approach. To estimate <b>seroconversion</b> during this <b>period,</b> blood samples were collected from the maximum possible number of animals surveyed in S 1. Environmental samples were collected in S 2 to identify active shedding. Farms were allocated into 3 different categories in each study according to PCR and ELISA results: category A, with BTM ELISA and PCR positive herds and at least 1 seropositive animal; category B, with BTM ELISA or PCR positive herds or individual sera positive; and category C, with all negative results among herds. Changes in herd category between S 1 and S 2 were grouped in 9 classes. Two statistical models, one to search for drives of within-herd changes in C. burnetii infection status and another to look for variables modulating individual changes in C. burnetii antibody level, were built. Several herds in category A in S 1 remained in that category 2 yr later, indicating that C. burnetii can remain within a herd for a long time. Most of the herds with seroconversion and detection of the bacterium in the environment belonged to category A, suggesting active and recent infections. Changes in the epidemiological status of herds were driven by local densities of domestic ruminants, showing the implication of neighbor reservoirs; whereas individual changes in antibody levels were modulated by variation in the epidemiological status of herds. Observed changes in epidemiological status allowed depiction of the hypothesized life cycle of C. burnetii within dairy cattle herds, which should be tested by future long-term series studies on C. burnetii infection to help fitting control measures (e. g., vaccination) to within-herd C. burnetii status.

40|$|Screening of {{antibodies}} to hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{is widely used}} for monitoring the prevalence of HCV infections and to assess HCV infectivity. Among HCV-infected individuals in the general population, the interval between the detection of HCV RNA {{and the development of}} HCV antibodies is usually 5 to 6 weeks, but in rare cases, seroconversion may be prolonged up to 6 to 9 months. In this study, we tested for the presence of HCV RNA during the antibody-undetectable period of 19 drug-injecting HCV seroconverters to gain insight into the antibody-negative carrier status in this population. HCV seroconversion status was determined by testing the first and last serum samples obtained from each subject, using third-generation antibody screening and confirmation assays. Serial samples were tested for HCV-specific {{antibodies to}} establish the moment of seroconversion and HCV RNA by single reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and branched DNA assay (bDNA) in serum. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were independently collected and tested for HCV RNA. HCV RNA-positivity was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization and sequencing of serial samples. The 19 HCV seroconverters had a mean follow-up of 5 years (range, 1 to 8 years). Of the 19, 4 were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected before HCV seroconversion. HCV RNA was detected in serum before seroconversion in 12 (63. 2 %) of the 19 HCV seroconverters, independent of HIV status. In 7 of these 12, the antibody-undetectable period was relatively short (2 to 10 months). The other 5, who were all HIV-negative before HCV seroconversion, had intermittent low levels of HCV RNA before <b>seroconversion</b> for a <b>period</b> of more than 12 months, with a mean of 40. 8 months (range, 13 to 94 months). In all 5 individuals, independent repeats of the experiments confirmed the presence of HCV RNA in serum, and in 3 of these individuals, HCV-positivity was confirmed in independently collected plasma and PBMC samples. Low levels of HCV RNA may be present during prolonged antibody-undetectable <b>periods</b> before <b>seroconversion</b> in a number of injecting drug users. Independent of HIV status, their immune system appears to be unable to respond to these low HCV RNA levels and was sometimes only activated after reinfections with distinct HCV genotypes. These results indicate that primary HCV infection may not always elicit the rapid emergence of HCV antibodies and suggests that persistent low levels of HCV RNA (regardless of the genotype) may not elicit at all or delay antibody responses for prolonged periods of tim...|$|R
