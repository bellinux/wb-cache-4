5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that a footbridge, to be named Immigration Bridge, be built between the National Museum of Australia and Lennox Gardens on the south <b>shore,</b> <b>in</b> recognition of the contributions that immigrants have made to Australia. The proposal has mostly received negative feedback. An inquiry recommended that the bridge be redesigned or moved to accommodate the needs of other lake users.|$|E
50|$|From 1843 until 1911, {{what would}} later become the Village of St. Clair <b>Shores</b> <b>in</b> 1925 {{was a part of}} Erin Township, parts of which make up today's Eastpointe, Roseville, and St. Clair <b>Shores.</b> <b>In</b> 1911, the eastern portion of the {{township}} now occupied by St. Clair Shores was partitioned from Erin Township to become Lake Township. Lake Township existed until 2009, when residents of the village of Grosse Pointe Shores (that portion of Grosse Pointe <b>Shores</b> <b>in</b> Macomb County located within Lake Township) voted to incorporate as a city.|$|R

5|$|Early in 1953, Carson began {{library and}} field {{research}} on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic <b>shore.</b> <b>In</b> 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, The Edge of the Sea, which focuses on life in coastal ecosystems (particularly along the Eastern Seaboard). It appeared in The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; The Edge of the Sea received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for The Sea Around Us.|$|E
5|$|Galveston Bay {{is mostly}} shallow {{with an average}} depth of 7–9feet. It is fed by the Trinity River and the San Jacinto River, {{numerous}} local bayous and incoming tides from the Gulf of Mexico. This unique and complex mixing of waters from different sources supports many types of marine life including crabs, shrimp, oysters, and many varieties of fish thereby supporting a substantial fishing industry. Additionally the system of bayous, rivers, and marshes that ring the Bay support their own ecosystems allowing for diverse wildlife and enabling freshwater farming of crawfish. The areas near the bay <b>shore</b> <b>in</b> fact have a higher diversity of habitats than the nearby Gulf coast.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 13 January 1797 {{was a minor}} naval battle fought {{between a}} French ship {{of the line and}} two British frigates off the coast of Brittany during the French Revolutionary Wars. During the action the frigates outmanoeuvred the much larger French vessel and drove it onto <b>shore</b> <b>in</b> heavy seas, {{resulting}} in the deaths of between 400 and 1,000 of the 1,300persons aboard. One of the British frigates was also lost in the engagement with six sailors drowned after running onto a sandbank while failing to escape a lee shore.|$|E
5|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} bid to become Lord Mayor of Sydney that saw him {{defeated by the}} Labor Party's Pat Hills, Waddy {{was elected to the}} New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Liberal member for the newly created seat of Kirribilli, on Sydney's North <b>Shore,</b> <b>in</b> March 1962. He sold his interest in JohnL. Waddy Pty Ltd the same year. Appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education in 1967, he was an Assistant Minister from February 1969 until March 1971, when he became a Minister of the Crown in charge of Child Welfare and Social Welfare in Premier Robert Askin's cabinet, succeeding Frederick Hewitt. His portfolio included responsibility for Aboriginal affairs; in 1972 he founded the Aboriginal Lands Trust, staffed by a council of nine elected Indigenous Australians, to assume freehold title of former government reserves in New South Wales as a precursor to granting land rights.|$|E
5|$|At dawn, lookouts on Greyhound {{were able}} to {{establish}} that Victoria was a large merchant ship rather than a warship and Elphinstone was encouraged to resume the attack. Aalbers sailed shortly afterwards, his ships tacking away from the <b>shore</b> <b>in</b> line of battle ready for the British advance. In doing so, Pallas drew ahead of the next ship in line, creating a gap through which the British attack could be directed. At 05:00, Elphinstone raised French colours {{in an effort to}} confuse the Dutch officers and indicated that he wished to speak with the Dutch commander. Aalbers was not fooled, and when Elphinstone opened fire on Pallas at close range at 05:30, the Dutch frigate replied immediately. With the frigates engaged, Harrier cut between Pallas and Victoria, Troubridge discharging his carronades into Victoria and ordering his crew to fire muskets at the deck of Pallas. In response, Victoria and Batavier pulled out of the line to engage Harrier, which continued its fire against Pallas, while William, bringing up the rear of the Dutch line, pulled out completely and sailed for the coast.|$|E

5|$|At that intersection, the {{trunkline}} {{meets the}} northern end of M-22, which is running concurrently with M-72 along the parkway. As US31/M-37 turns east to run along the bay north of downtown, the highway merges with M-72 and picks up the LMCT again. Grandview Parkway runs between the Boardman River and the bay. Near the mouth of the river, US31/M-37/M-72 turns to follow Front Street along the remainder of the bay's shoreline. At Garfield Avenue, M-37 turns northward to run up the Old Mission Peninsula, and US31/M-72 continues across the base of the peninsula to the East Arm of the Grand Traverse Bay. The highway runs north of the Cherry Capital Airport near the east arm as it angles southeasterly to Traverse City State Park. East of the park, the trunkline exits suburban Traverse City and rounds the bay to run northward along its eastern <b>shore.</b> <b>In</b> the community of Acme, M-72 turns eastward while US31 continues north past the Grand Traverse Resort.|$|E
5|$|Cain {{started on}} Opening Day for the Giants in 2013. He pitched six shutout innings before being removed {{due to a}} high pitch count; however, Kershaw threw a shutout, and the Dodgers beat the Giants 40. On April 7, Cain threw two no-hit innings before giving up nine runs {{in the third inning}} and getting removed from the game, {{becoming}} the first Giants to allow nine runs in an inning since Ernie <b>Shore</b> <b>in</b> 1912. The Cardinals beat the Giants 14–3. On August 23 against the Pirates, Cain was hit by Gaby Sánchez's line drive in the pitching arm, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list {{for the first time in}} his career. Cain would finish the season with a record of 8-10 in 30 starts. For the first time since 2006, Cain's ERA sat in the 4's, finishing with an exact 4.00 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Hotham and Osborn {{discussed}} {{the situation and}} determined to destroy the wreck to deny it to the French. To this end, three cutters were gathered and a boarding party under Lieutenant Edward Grey sent in to attack Preneuse at 20:00. This party came under fire from the batteries but was able to successfully access the battered French frigate at 21:00, finding that only the officers {{and a handful of}} sailors remained, the others having been given the opportunity to escape to the <b>shore</b> <b>in</b> boats rather than become prisoners of war. Among the captives was Lhermitte, who was permitted to bring his personal baggage with him before he was brought to the British squadron as a prisoner. Grey then set the wrecked ship alight before returning to Adamant, having executed his orders without losing a single man.|$|E

5|$|M-72 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan, running from Lake Huron to Lake Michigan across {{the northern part of}} the Lower Peninsula. The highway connects M-22 in Empire with US Highway 23 (US23) in Harrisville. It is one of only three Michigan state trunklines that cross the Lower Peninsula, shore to <b>shore.</b> <b>In</b> between, M-72 runs across Northern Michigan woodland, agricultural areas of the Leelanau Peninsula near Traverse City, and the Au Sable River watershed. The trunkline also provides access to Camp Grayling, a National Guard training facility near the city of the same name. Traffic levels along the highway vary from approximately 800vehicles a day on the east end to over 32,000vehicles near Traverse City.|$|E
5|$|Quackenbush {{became a}} fan {{favourite}} upon {{his arrival in}} Boston, where his offensive style of play was compared to former Bruin (and fellow Hall of Famer) Eddie <b>Shore.</b> <b>In</b> his first season in Boston, Quackenbush scored 8 goals and 25 points. He continued {{to stay out of}} the penalty box, registering only 4 penalty minutes. However, it marked the first time in three seasons that he was not named to the NHL All-Star Team. The Bruins defence core was depleted by injury in 1950–51, forcing the team to use several first year players. While this resulted in Quackenbush having to play more minutes, including a game where he played 55 minutes, it also gave him the opportunity to play with his brother Max. It was the only time the two played professionally together. He also set a career high in points with 29 and was again named a First Team NHL All-Star. Over the next five seasons Quackenbush hovered around the 20 point mark and was never assessed more than 8 penalty minutes in a year.|$|E
5|$|Retiring {{from the}} {{encounter}} with Blenheim, Linois sailed westwards and arrived in Simon's Bay at the Dutch colony of Cape Town on 13 September. He was hoping there to join up with the Dutch squadron maintained at the Cape, but discovered that the only significant Dutch warship in the port was the ship of the line Bato, which was stripped down and unfit for service at sea. Repairing the damage suffered in the August engagement and replenishing food and naval stores {{over the next two}} months, Linois was joined in October by Atalante. On 5 November a gale swept the bay and Atalante dragged her anchors, Captain Gaudin-Beauchène powerless to prevent his frigate driving ashore and rapidly becoming a total wreck. The crew were able to escape to <b>shore</b> <b>in</b> small boats and were then divided among Marengo and Belle Poule, with 160 men left to augment the garrison at Cape Town. Linois's prize, the Brunswick, too was wrecked near Simon's Bay.|$|E
