OGSA is based on several other Web service technologies, such as the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), but it aims to be largely independent of transport-level handling of data.OGSA {{has been described as}} a refinement of a Web services architecture, specifically designed to <b>support</b> <b>grid</b> requirements. The concept of OGSA is derived from work presented in the 2002 Globus Alliance paper [...] "The Physiology of the Grid" [...] by Ian Foster, Carl Kesselman, Jeffrey M. Nick, and Steven Tuecke.It was developed by GGF working groups which resulted in a document, entitled The Open Grid Services Architecture, Version 1.5 in 2006.

50|$|As {{a variant}} of the RAPID (Refueling by All Pins Integrated Design) fast reactor concept, it can be refueled in a quick and simple manner.Essential for this feature is that the reactor core {{consists}} of an Integrated Fuel Assembly (IFA) instead of conventional fuel subassemblies.This small core has 2700 fuel elements (pins) combined together by the IFA, consisting of a core <b>support</b> <b>grid</b> and several spacer grids, and are assembled into a fuel cartridge.This cartridge can be replaced as a unit. The reactor can be operated without refueling for up to 10 years (80% nominal power). The reactor has no control rods.To achieve fully automated operation the reactor relies on various reactivity control systems: Lithium Expansion Module (LEM), Lithium Injection Module (LIM) and Lithium Release Module (LRM).LEM serves for inherent reactivity feedback, LIM serves for inherent ultimate shutdown, and LRM serves for automated reactor startup. These passive systems help to mitigate the effects of fuel depletion, allowing a long fuel life. The bias factors were used to determine the number of LEM and LIM needed in the core to achieve fully automated operation.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} the energy efficiency of an electron source with a multi-aperture plasma emitter where the generated beam is extracted {{into the atmosphere}} through a thin metal foil. The boundary of the plasma produced {{in this type of}} emitter is stabilized with a fine metal grid. To prevent the loss of electrons at the circle-holed <b>support</b> <b>grid</b> of the extraction foil window, a metal mask with holes of smaller diameter arranged coaxially to the <b>support</b> <b>grid</b> holes is put on the emission grid. Thus, the electron beam is a superposition of beamlets formed by individual electron emitting units with the plasma boundary stabilized by the fine metal grid. The efficiency of current extraction from the acceleration gap into the atmosphere reached 75 % with respect to the gap current, making possible to increase the average power of the extracted electron beam. With a 200 -kV accelerating voltage, a 16 -A current in the acceleration gap, and 40 µs FWHM pulse duration, 4 kW of the average beam power was extracted into the atmosphere from the acceleration gap. With the geometric transparency of the <b>support</b> <b>grid</b> of the extraction foil window equal to 56 %, this made 65 % of the beam power in the gap.

40|$|Faults {{in medium}} and high voltage grids lead to voltage sags {{in the low}} voltage level. Due to the voltage dip, {{distributed}} generators disconnect from the low voltage grid. Depending {{on the amount of}} disconnected generation, system stability could be compromised. With a dynamic <b>grid</b> <b>support,</b> distributed generators remain connected to the grid during faults, also called fault ride-through. Moreover, the feed in of reactive power supports the voltage during the fault. According to the present state of the art, no requirements exist for a dynamic <b>grid</b> <b>support</b> in low voltage grids. However, with a high penetration of distributed generation these requirements might change in the future. This paper investigates the dynamic <b>grid</b> <b>support</b> in low voltage grids. The impact of a dynamic <b>grid</b> <b>support</b> on a distribution grid is studied with IEEE/CIGRE benchmark models for low and medium voltage grids. Models of inverters, directly-coupled synchronous and induction generators are implemented. Furthermore, a present and a future protection system with fault ride-through capability are added to the grid models. The inverters are equipped with a reactive current controller to give a voltage support during faults. To determine the effect of a dynamic <b>grid</b> <b>support,</b> faults in high and medium voltage grids with and without dynamic <b>grid</b> <b>support</b> are simulated and evaluated. The results have shown that the effect of the voltage boost through dynamic <b>grid</b> <b>support</b> in order to recover the voltage is marginal. However, with a high penetration level of distributed generators the voltage boost increases and the impact of faults can be further limited. This investigation has demonstrated the potential of dynamic <b>grid</b> <b>support</b> in low voltage grids to avoid the loss of a large amount of power and to improve the voltage recovery...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{potential}} and possible effects of using building services installations (notably ventilation systems) to <b>support</b> power <b>grids.</b> This is significant taken that the shift towards smart grids comes with adoption of demand side integration {{and the concept of}} active controllable loads.

In this {{paper we propose a}} performance oriented approach to GRID application development, founded on the use of a prototype language (MetaPL) for the description of the applications and the use of a heterogeneous system simulation environment (HeSSE) for performance prediction. We developed GRID simulation components for the existing simulation environment (HeSSE) and validated them. After that we extended the MetaPL language in order to explicitly <b>support</b> <b>GRID</b> application features and simulated a simple case study to show how the approach works. ...|$|E
