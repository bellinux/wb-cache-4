40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} characteristics of a cosmetic product is maintain or improving the condition and characteristics of the skin surface. In dermatological, respectively cosmetic practice, there is very often a problem of an objective assessment of the obtained data, which corresponds to visual changes in <b>skin</b> <b>relief.</b> With technical advancements has it been proposed many approaches of solution: mechanical needle devices, optical interference devices, and microscopic, holographic, laser and photometers ones. Each of them has its advantages and negative qualities. The newest devices allow not only two-dimensional assessment (2 D), but also spatial one (3 D). Scientific literature such as Measuring the Skin recommends for these cases scanning the surface in 3 D, using the contact scanners for made imprints. Here, however, errors that may be caused by mechanical method of scanning <b>skin</b> <b>relief</b> are not taken into consideration and there is also not clearly described the material suitable for the production of custom impression.

40|$|Vitamin C {{is known}} for its {{antioxidant}} potential and activity in the collagen biosynthetic pathway. Photoprotective properties of topically applied vitamin C have also been demonstrated, placing this molecule as a potential candidate for use in the prevention and treatment of skin ageing. A topically applied cream containing 5 % vitamin C and its excipient were tested on healthy female volunteers presenting with photoaged skin on their low-neck and arms in view to evaluate efficacy and safety of such treatment. A double-blind, randomized trial was performed over a 6 -month period, comparing the action of the vitamin C cream vs. excipient on photoaged skin. Clinical assessments included evaluation at the beginning and after 3 and 6 months of daily treatment. They were performed by the investigator and compared with the volunteer self assessment. <b>Skin</b> <b>relief</b> parameters were determined on silicone rubber replicas performed at the same time-points. Cutaneous biopsies were obtained {{at the end of the}} trial and investigated using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Clinical examination by a dermatologist as well as self-assessment by the volunteers disclosed a significant improvement, in terms of the 'global score', on the vitamin C-treated side compared with the control. A highly significant increase in the density of skin microrelief and a decrease of the deep furrows were demonstrated. Ultrastructural evidence of the elastic tissue repair was also obtained and well corroborated the favorable results of the clinical and skin surface examinations. Topical application of 5 % vitamin C cream was an effective and well-tolerated treatment. It led to a clinically apparent improvement of the photodamaged skin and induced modifications of <b>skin</b> <b>relief</b> and ultrastructure, suggesting a positive influence of topical vitamin C on parameters characteristic for sun-induced skin ageing.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate mutual interchangeability of four principally different biometric instrumental techniques designed for objective measurement of changes in the physical, mechanical, and topographical properties of the skin surface treated with commercial antiaging cosmetic products with hyaluronic acid. The following instrumental devices were used: Visioscope PC 35, Corneometer Multiprobe Adapter MPA 6, Reviscometer RVM 600, and 3 D scanner Talysurf CLI 500. The comparison of the individual methods was performed using cluster analysis. The study involved 25 female volunteers aged 40 - 65. Measurements were taken before and after 30 daily in vivo applications of an antiaging preparation to the skin surface in the periorbital area. A slight reduction in skin surface roughness was recorded in 55 % of the volunteers. On the contrary, a worsening from their initial states was detected in 25 % of the subjects, while for 20 %, no significant change was reported. Cluster analysis confirmed that the mentioned methodologies can be divided into two basic clusters, namely, a cluster of methods recording the changes in <b>skin</b> <b>relief</b> by means of optical techniques, and a cluster of methods investigating changes in hydration and anisotropy. In practice, the techniques in different clusters are not interchangeable and should be assessed separately. © 2017 American Vacuum Society. TBU in Zlin [IGA/FT/ 2015 / 009...|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this article}} is to present a new {{methodology}} for assessment of skin topology using a three-dimensional image (3 D). Methods: The measurement of the skin surface roughness is based on 3 D scanning of silicone replicas by chromatic aberration length technique in a contactless manner, i. e. by a polychromatic light beam. Analysis of the skin surface reprints was performed using Talymap, Gold version. Results were analysed by fractal geometry, which allows to evaluate changes of the skin surface before and after application of cosmetics and instrumental cosmetological techniques. The methodology was applied for objective assessment of the effects of diamond microdermabrasion on the skin surface roughness. Measurements were performed on 23 volunteers in the age group of 31 – 67 years. Results: Based on the results of skin surface scanning after the treatment with diamond microdermabrasion it may be concluded that inequalities of the skin surface are reduced immediately after exfoliation. However, this effect mostly diminishes within 14 days after treatment. The entire study ultimately suggests that the instrumental method used only leads to improvement of the skin surface immediately after its application. Thermo vision images of the skin surface temperature were obtained during the application of the abrasive method. The experimental results showed that the skin is rather cooled than heated by the treatment. Conclusion: This study is focused on the development of a methodology for objective measurement of changes in treated <b>skin</b> <b>relief</b> using 3 D scanning. The results are evaluated using fractal dimension. The output may also include also an enlarged model of the skin surface made by 3 D printer, which can serve for illustrative communication with the client. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

40|$|Abstract Background Aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of the regular use of a hand cream after washing hands on skin hydration and skin roughness. Methods Twenty-five subjects washed hands and forearms with a neutral soap four times per day, for 2 minutes each time, for a total of two weeks. One part of them used a hand cream after each hand wash, the others did not (cross over design after a wash out period of two weeks). Skin roughness and skin hydration were determined on the forearms on days 2, 7, 9 and 14. For skin roughness, twelve silicon imprint per subject and time point were taken from the stratum corneum and assessed with a 3 D skin analyzer for depth of the <b>skin</b> <b>relief.</b> For skin hydration, five measurements per subject and time point were taken with a corneometer. Results Washing hands lead to a gradual increase of skin roughness from 100 (baseline) to a maximum of 108. 5 after 9 days. Use of a hand cream after each hand wash entailed a decrease of skin roughness which the lowest means after 2 (94. 5) and 14 days (94. 8). Skin hydration was gradually decreased after washing hands from 79 (baseline) to 65. 5 after 14 days. The hand wash, followed by use of a hand cream, still decreased skin hydration after 2 days (76. 1). Over the next 12 days, however, skin hydration did not change significantly (75. 6 after 14 days). Conclusion Repetitive and frequent hand washing increases skin dryness and roughness. Use of a hand cream immediately after each hand wash can confine both skin dryness and skin roughness. Regular use of skin care preparations should therefore help to prevent both dry and rough skin among healthcare workers in clinical practice. </p...|$|E

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{capacitance}} sensors {{can be used for}} skin hydration imaging, surface analysis and <b>skin</b> micro <b>relief</b> measurements. In this report, development of a hardware measurement instrument and accompanying software that was made is discussed. Work then focussed on stratum corneum (SC) dynamic water concentration measurements using the capacitance sensor. To further validate the measurement results, the capacitance sensors SC surface hydration results are compared with the optoAthermal transient emission radiometry (OTTER) and transA epidermal water loss (TEWL) results measured by using the condenserAchamber TEWL method. To achieve the aim of this project, a handAheld probe, based on the FingerPrint Card area sensor development kit (FPCASMD 5410, FPCAAMD 6410 and then on the FUJITSU MBFA 200), has been developed and used in this research. The development kit contains an array area sensor chip, a processor board and a serial/USB connecting cable for connecting to a PC. Dedicated JAVA, C++ and Mathworks MatLab programs have also been developed, which can capture the images, process the images, perform grayscale value calculation and display the images. A secondary program was developed in MatLab that allows extraction of data from raw image files created by the sensor. These data are then processed to show mathematical calculations and image profiling of the subject skin site. Additionally, the MBFA 200 sensor is able to record live video files of the skin. The precision of the resulting data is analysed and multiple experiments are conducted to test the viability and usage of the capacitance sensor in different areas of research such as skin hydration, occlusion, depilation and scar measurement.

40|$|SynopsisBackgroundCellulite {{refers to}} changes in <b>skin</b> <b>relief</b> on the thighs and {{buttocks}} of women, with a prevalence of 80 - 90 %, causing dissatisfaction and search for treatment. Etiopathogenesis is multifactorial, as follows: herniation of the hypodermis towards the dermis, facilitated by perpendicular fibrous septa, changes in the dermal extracellular matrix, decreased adiponectin, genetic polymorphism, microcirculation alterations and inflammatory process. There are numerous therapeutic approaches, with little evidence of effectiveness. the long-wave infrared (LWIR) radiation interacts with water, improves microcirculation and stimulates metabolic processes. To date, the use of tissues with potential reflection of LWIR radiation has not been systematically investigated as adjuvant treatment for cellulite. ObjectiveTo investigate the efficacy and safety of the treatment of cellulite {{through the use of}} compression stockings made with thread reflecting LWIR radiation. Patients and methodsClinical study of therapeutic intervention, controlled and double-blind, including 30 women, aging from 25 to 40 years, with cellulite of grades II and III on the thighs and buttocks who used compression stockings, pantyhose model, made with reflector thread of LWIR radiation, on only one randomized side. Women under other treatments for cellulite and with venous and/or blood insufficiencies were excluded. Evaluation of efficacy by clinical parameters, photographs, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), cutometry and high frequency ultrasonography and security by observation of adverse events and venous EcoDoppler recordings. ResultsDLQI scores showed significant reduction; the two-dimensional high-frequency ultrasonography showed an insignificant increase in dermal echogenicity as well as other efficacy parameters demonstrated no or slight improvement, with no differences between the sides exposed or not to LWIR; and there were no severe adverse events. ConclusionCompression stockings, with or without thread reflector of LWIR, showed slight effects in the appearance of cellulite, but the treatment determined a positive impact on women quality of life.

Although there are many studies supporting {{the positive effects of}} topical treatment, there are no published studies demonstrating the effects of oral supplementation in the prevention of negative skin changes during winter. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of an oral micronutrient supplement in preventing the negative effects of winter weather on skin quality using noninvasive biometrologic instruments. Methods: This study included 80 healthy female volunteers aged 35 – 55 years with phototype II–IV skin. Randomization was balanced. Two tablets of a micronutrient supplement (Perfectil® Platinum) or placebo were administered once daily for 4 months. The volunteers were examined at baseline, after 4 months, and 6 weeks after termination of treatment (month 5. 5). The evaluation included skin microrelief by Visioscan® as the main outcome, and the secondary outcomes were results on standard macrophotography, skin tension by Reviscometer®, skin high-frequency ultrasound, and self-assessment. Results: For all pseudoroughness and microrelief indicators, there was a significant increase from baseline to month 4 in the placebo group (P< 0. 05) but no change in the active group. Descriptive statistics for the mean minimum, mean maximum, and minimum to maximum ratio on the nonexposed study zone showed a significant and dramatic difference between baseline and month 4 and between baseline and month 5. 5 (P< 0. 05) in the active group, indicating decreasing anisotropy of the skin. High-frequency ultrasound on the exposed study zone revealed that skin thickness was significantly decreased in the placebo group during winter but was stable in the treated group (P< 0. 01). The photography scaling and self-assessment questionnaire revealed no significant changes in either group. Conclusion: These results indicate that the skin is prone to seasonal changes during winter, particularly in exposed areas. The data also indicate that oral supplementation can be a safe treatment, with no serious side effects, and may prevent or even eliminate the negative effects of winter on the skin.
