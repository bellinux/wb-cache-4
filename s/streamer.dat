5|$|The 295th Regiment {{returned}} on February 20, 1946 {{from the}} Panama Canal Zone, and the 296th Regiment on March 6. Both regiments were awarded the American Theatre <b>streamer</b> and the Pacific Theatre <b>streamer.</b> They were inactivated that same year.|$|E
5|$|As {{the brigade}} {{has been in}} a {{training}} and supporting role for the Army since its creation, the 166th Aviation Brigade has never been awarded a campaign <b>streamer</b> for campaign participation. It has also never been awarded a unit decoration.|$|E
5|$|The 7th Infantry Division {{was awarded}} one {{campaign}} <b>streamer</b> in World War I, four campaign streamers and two unit decorations in World War II, and ten campaign streamers and two unit decorations in the Korean War, {{for a total}} of fifteen campaign streamers and four unit decorations in its operational history.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} received six campaign <b>streamers</b> in World War I {{and four}} campaign <b>streamers</b> in World War II, {{for a total}} of 10 campaign <b>streamers</b> in its operational lifetime.|$|R
40|$|Properties of pulsed corona <b>streamers</b> are {{measured}} and simulated in full three spatial dimensions (3 D). Stereo photography {{is used to}} measure branching angles and to investigate whether apparent <b>streamers</b> reconnections are real. 3 D simulations of two parallel <b>streamers</b> show that they can repel each other electrostatically, but that they also can merge due to photoionization. The electrostatic interaction of several <b>streamers</b> becomes evident through theoretical investigations of a periodic array of <b>streamers...</b>|$|R
5|$|The corps {{received}} five campaign <b>streamers</b> in World War I {{and four}} campaign <b>streamers</b> in World War II. It also received two campaign <b>streamers</b> and two unit awards during the War on Terrorism.|$|R
5|$|The IX Corps {{was awarded}} one {{campaign}} <b>streamer</b> for service in World War II, and nine campaign streamers and two unit decorations during its {{service in the}} Korean War {{for a total of}} ten streamers and two unit decorations in its operational history.|$|E
5|$|Florida State University's Reserve Officer Training Corps is the {{official}} officer training and commissioning program at Florida State University. Dating back to Civil War days, the ROTC unit at Florida State University {{is one of four}} collegiate military units with permission to display a battle <b>streamer,</b> in recognition of the military service of student cadets during the Battle of Natural Bridge in 1865.|$|E
5|$|On 24 September, Jasta 10 pilots {{dropped a}} note inquiring about Voss {{attached}} to a black, white, and red <b>streamer</b> over British lines. By 25 September, {{two days after the}} fight, the Niederrheinische Volkszeitung ran a notice of Voss's death. That same day, Jasta 10 lost its second commander in three days, when Weigand was killed in action.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry Division {{was awarded}} five {{campaign}} <b>streamers</b> and one unit decoration in World War II, eight campaign <b>streamers</b> and three unit decorations in the Korean War, two campaign <b>streamers</b> for the Gulf War, and one unit award in peacetime, {{for a total}} of fifteen campaign <b>streamers</b> and five unit decorations in its operational history.|$|R
25|$|Each service {{attaches}} campaign/battle <b>streamers,</b> sometimes {{known as}} battle honours, for actions {{in which the}} service {{as a whole has}} taken part. These can either be war service <b>streamers,</b> which are in the colours of the appropriate campaign medal and have the name of the campaign embroidered; or unit citation <b>streamers,</b> which have the name of the action embroidered and signify that the unit's performance in a specific action has been worthy of special mention. Units are also permitted to wear <b>streamers</b> of overseas awards they may have been presented with. These <b>streamers</b> are in the colours of the appropriate medal ribbon. The <b>streamers</b> are 3ft × 2.75in. The Army, for instance, currently has 178 service <b>streamers,</b> embroidering the name of each battle on each, as does the Air Force. The Marine Corps and Navy instead embroider award devices onto <b>streamers</b> to consolidate them, having 62 and 34, respectively.|$|R
50|$|<b>Streamers</b> are {{transient}} (exist {{only for}} a short time) and filamentary, which makes them different from corona discharges. They are used in applications such as ozone production, air purification or plasma medicine. <b>Streamers</b> {{pave the way for}} arcs and lightning leaders, in which the ionized paths created by <b>streamers</b> are heated by large currents. <b>Streamers</b> can also be observed as sprites in the upper atmosphere. Due to the low pressure, sprites are much larger than <b>streamers</b> at ground pressure, see the similarity laws below.|$|R
5|$|The 10th Mountain Division {{was awarded}} two {{campaign}} streamers in World War II, one campaign <b>streamer</b> for Somalia, and four campaign streamers in the War on Terrorism {{for a total}} of seven campaign streamers and three unit decorations in its operational history. Note that some of the division's brigades received more or fewer decorations depending on their individual deployments.|$|E
5|$|The brigade was {{deployed}} to the North African Campaign in 1942, participating in Operation Torch, where it conducted its first amphibious assault, and earning the brigade its first campaign <b>streamer</b> for the battle around Algeria and French Morocco. It would continue supporting Allied units as they pushed Axis forces out of North Africa during the Tunisia Campaign.|$|E
5|$|In early November, the 13th Brigade began readying {{itself for}} {{an attack on the}} Hindenburg Line with the {{division}}, which was part of the Second Army. The division launched a reconnaissance in force on the Voëvre Plain, but before it could begin a full assault, the Allies signed an Armistice ending hostilities. After 33 days on the front lines, the 7th Division suffered 1,988 casualties. It was awarded one campaign <b>streamer</b> for Lorraine. The brigade performed occupation duties for the next year as it began preparations to return to the continental United States.|$|E
5|$|The I Corps {{was awarded}} seven {{campaign}} <b>streamers</b> for service in World War I, three campaign <b>streamers</b> and two unit decorations in World War II, ten campaign <b>streamers</b> and one unit decoration in the Korean War, one unit award during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and one unit award in peacetime, {{for a total}} of 20 campaign <b>streamers</b> and five unit decorations in its operational history.|$|R
40|$|The {{microbial}} {{composition of}} acid <b>streamers</b> (macroscopic biofilms) in acidic, metal-rich waters in two locations (an abandoned copper mine and a chalybeate spa) in north Wales was studied using cultivation-based and biomolecular techniques. Known chemolithotrophic and heterotrophic acidophiles were readily isolated from disrupted <b>streamers,</b> but they {{accounted for only}} < 1 to 7 % of the total microorganisms present. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that 80 to 90 % of the microbes in both types of <b>streamers</b> were β-Proteobacteria. Terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis of the <b>streamers</b> suggested that a single bacterial species was dominant in the copper mine <b>streamers,</b> while two distinct bacteria (one of which was identical to the bacterium found in the copper mine <b>streamers)</b> accounted for about 90 % of the <b>streamers</b> in the spa water. 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries showed that the β-proteobacterium found in both locations was closely related to a clone detected previously in acid mine drainage in California and that its closest characterized relatives were neutrophilic ammonium oxidizers. Using a modified isolation technique, this bacterium was isolated from the copper mine <b>streamers</b> and shown to be a novel acidophilic autotrophic iron oxidizer. The β-proteobacterium found only in the spa <b>streamers</b> was closely related to the neutrophilic iron oxidizer Gallionella ferruginea. FISH analysis using oligonucleotide probes that targeted the two β-proteobacteria confirmed that the biodiversity of the <b>streamers</b> in both locations was very limited. The microbial compositions of the acid <b>streamers</b> found at the two north Wales sites are very different from the microbial compositions of the previously described acid <b>streamers</b> found at Iron Mountain, California, and the Rio Tinto, Spain...|$|R
50|$|The 45th Infantry Division {{was awarded}} eight {{campaign}} <b>streamers</b> and one unit award in World War II and four campaign <b>streamers</b> and one unit decoration in the Korean War, {{for a total}} of twelve campaign <b>streamers</b> and two unit decorations in its operational history.|$|R
5|$|The 174th Infantry Brigade {{was first}} {{constituted}} on 5 August 1917 in the National Army. It was organized on 25 August 1917 at Camp Dix, New Jersey, and {{assigned to the}} 87th Division. It never saw combat in World War I, like the other units of the 87th Division, the brigade was used for labor duties and a pool of reinforcements. It received a campaign <b>streamer</b> for World War I without an inscription. After the war, it was demobilized on 23 May 1919 at Camp Dix, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Raziel {{discovers the}} Oracle's Cave, where Moebius the Time <b>Streamer</b> once hid the Chronoplast, a magical time machine. Raziel {{traverses}} the caves and finds Kain in the Chronoplast's control room. Raziel is angered {{over what he}} has learned, and Kain says his actions are justified due to his being subject to destiny, before proceeding to inform Raziel that the Sarafan were far from the noble crusaders that Raziel believes them to be when the latter demands to know why he created him, which Raziel refuses to listen to. Raziel attacks Kain while the latter continues to adjust the Chronoplast's controls. Although Raziel eventually gains an advantage, the Chronoplast activates, and Kain escapes through a time portal, beckoning Raziel to follow. Raziel complies, ignoring warnings from The Elder God. As the game ends, Raziel emerges from the timeslip and is greeted by Moebius, leading into the events of Soul Reaver 2.|$|E
5|$|Innocence began {{production}} in 2006 at Alfa System {{as the next}} main entry in the Tales series. Developed parallel to the DS spin-off title Tales of the Tempest, {{the goal was to}} include all the series' main gameplay and narrative elements despite the limited medium. The character designs were done by Mutsumi Inomata, while the music was composed by series newcomer Kazuhiro Nakamura. Extensive voice acting was included using CRI Middleware's Kyuseishu Sound <b>Streamer</b> compression algorithm. After release, it was decided to remake Innocence for the Vita, using platform-specific gameplay functions, redone voice work and music, and new characters. Japanese singer-songwriter Kokia created the opening theme songs for both versions of Innocence. Both versions have been positively received in Japan, and Western opinions on the two versions of Innocence have been mostly positive.|$|E
40|$|The {{co-occurrence of}} warm {{conveyor}} belts (WCBs), strongly ascending moist airstreams in extratropical cyclones, and stratospheric potential vorticity (PV) <b>streamers,</b> indicators for breaking Rossby waves on the tropopause, is investigated for a 21 -yr {{period in the}} Northern Hemisphere using Interim European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data. WCB outflows and PV <b>streamers</b> are respectively identified as two- and three-dimensional objects and tracked during their life cycle. PV <b>streamers</b> are more frequent than WCB outflows and nearly 15 % of all PV <b>streamers</b> co-occur with WCBs during their life cycle, whereas about 60 % of all WCB outflows co-occur with PV <b>streamers.</b> Co-occurrences are most frequent over the North Atlantic and North Pacific in spring and winter. WCB outflows are often located upstream of the PV <b>streamers</b> and form earlier, indicating the importance of diabatic processes for downstream Rossby wave breaking. Less frequently, PV <b>streamers</b> occur first, leading {{to the formation of}} new WCBs...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed {{positive}} corona <b>streamers</b> in air are {{studied by}} images obtained with an intensified CCD camera. Using a switched capacitor power supply, thin <b>streamers</b> are observed that branch. A power supply {{consisting of a}} 4 -stage transmission line transformer gives pulses of much higher current to the same gap. In this case, the number of <b>streamers</b> is less, they are wider and they hardly branch. The current density is roughly 1 A/mm 2 in both type of <b>streamers...</b>|$|R

5|$|Raziel {{returns as}} {{the protagonist of}} Soul Reaver 2. In Soul Reaver, Raziel {{discovered}} that he was once a human and a leading member of the vampire-hunting Sarafan brotherhood, and his epiphanies drive {{the conflict in the}} story. Kain, the antagonist of Soul Reaver, appears as a non-player character in cutscenes, urging Raziel to unearth his destiny. Moebius the Time <b>Streamer,</b> a sorcerer who was a villain in Blood Omen, attempts to manipulate Raziel into destroying Kain—it is revealed that he is an agent of The Elder God, Raziel's ally and guide in Soul Reaver, who is slowly established as a more sinister entity. Ariel, a specter bound to the Pillars who featured in Blood Omen and Soul Reaver, returns, and the vampire Vorador, also from Blood Omen, assists Raziel early in the game. The ancient vampire Janos Audron, a new character who was previously only mentioned in Blood Omen, acts as Raziel's mentor {{towards the end of the}} story.|$|E
25|$|The 295th Regiment {{returned}} on February 20, 1946 {{from the}} Panama Canal Zone, and the 296th Regiment on March 6. Both regiments were awarded the American Theatre <b>streamer</b> and the Pacific Theatre <b>streamer.</b> They were inactivated that same year.|$|E
25|$|The {{cassette}} {{was adapted}} {{into what is}} called a <b>streamer</b> cassette, a version dedicated solely for data storage, and used chiefly for hard disk backups and other types of data. <b>Streamer</b> cassettes look almost exactly the same as a standard cassette, with the exception of having a notch about one quarter-inch wide and deep situated slightly off-center at the top edge of the cassette. <b>Streamer</b> cassettes also have a re-usable write-protect tab on only one side of the top edge of the cassette, with {{the other side of the}} top edge having either only an open rectangular hole, or no hole at all. This is due to the entire one-eighth inch width of the tape loaded inside being used by a <b>streamer</b> cassette drive for the writing and reading of data, hence only one side of the cassette being used. <b>Streamer</b> cassettes can hold anywhere from 50 to 160 megabytes of data.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Photographs show {{distinct}} {{differences between}} positive <b>streamers</b> in air or in a nitrogen-oxygen mixture (0. 2 % O 2). The <b>streamers</b> in the mixture branch more frequently, but the branches also extinguish more easily. Probably related to that, the <b>streamers</b> in the mixture propagate {{more in a}} zigzag manner while they are straighter in air. Furthermore, <b>streamers</b> in the mixture can become longer; they are thinner and more intense. <b>Streamers</b> are narrow rapidly growing ionized channels. They can be created when a high voltage is applied to a nonconducting medium [1]. They are used for example in gas and water cleaning [1, 2]. In nature they are observed as so-called sprite discharges in the atmosphere at 40 to 90 km altitude [3]. <b>Streamers</b> are often investigated in ambient air since {{this is the most}} commonly used gas in applications...|$|R
50|$|The 1st Brigade, 10th Mountain Division earned two {{campaign}} <b>streamers</b> in World War II and two campaign <b>streamers</b> in the War on Terrorism for a {{total of}} four campaign <b>streamers</b> and two unit decorations in its operational history. Note that some of the brigade's battalions received more or fewer decorations depending on their individual deployments.|$|R
40|$|The crew of Apollo 17 saw <b>streamers</b> {{accompanying}} spacecraft sunrise. The time {{variations of}} the brightness of these <b>streamers</b> indicate that they were produced by light scattering in the lunar vicinity rather than brightness variations of material <b>streamers</b> emanating from the sun. The angular extent of the <b>streamers</b> indicate that the light scattering particulates extended from the lunar surface to above the orbital altitude of the spacecraft. Although observed as typical sunrise phenomena by Apollos 10 and 17, and possibly by 8 and 15 as well, <b>streamers</b> were not observed during the flight of Apollo 16. The scattering particles seem to be present sporadically, most likely lunar dust of tenth micron scale, and not a result of spacecraft contamination...|$|R
25|$|The 296th Regiment {{returned}} to Puerto Rico on March 6, 1946 and {{was awarded the}} American Theater <b>streamer</b> and the Pacific Theater <b>streamer.</b> On November 12, 1946, Marxuach was promoted to colonel. In 1947, he retired as regimental executive officer of Headquarters Co. of the 296th, due to a service-related disability. The 296th was deactivated that same year.|$|E
25|$|The Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps unit at Florida State University {{is one of}} {{only four}} ROTC units in the United States with {{permission}} to display a campaign <b>streamer.</b> The <b>streamer</b> reads NATURAL BRIDGE 1865.
