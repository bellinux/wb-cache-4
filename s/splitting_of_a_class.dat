40|$|Recent {{computer}} systems research has proposed using re-dundant requests to reduce latency. The {{idea is to}} run a request on multiple servers {{and wait for the}} first completion (discarding all remaining copies of the request). However there is no exact analysis of systems with redundancy. This paper presents the first exact analysis of systems with redundancy. We allow for any number of classes of redun-dant requests, any number of classes of non-redundant re-quests, any degree of redundancy, and any number of het-erogeneous servers. In all cases we derive the limiting dis-tribution {{on the state of the}} system. In small (two or three server) systems, we derive simple forms for the distribution of response time of both the re-dundant classes and non-redundant classes, and we quantify the “gain ” to redundant classes and “pain ” to non-redundant classes caused by redundancy. We find some surprising re-sults. First, the response time of a fully redundant class follows a simple Exponential distribution and that of the non-redundant class follows a Generalized Hyperexponen-tial. Second, fully redundant classes are “immune ” to any pain caused by other classes becoming redundant. We also compare redundancy with other approaches for reducing latency, such as optimal probabilistic <b>splitting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> among servers (Opt-Split) and Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) routing of a class. We find that, in many cases, re-dundancy outperforms JSQ and Opt-Split with respect to overall response time, making it an attractive solution...|$|E

Our past efforts have investigated user-role based security (URBS) for discretionary access control to provide customizable access to the public interface of object types/classes, allowing different individuals specialized access at different times based on their needs and responsibilities within the application. Remember, once a method {{is placed in the}} public interface, if only for a single user, it is available to all users, regardless of their needs. While the private/public <b>split</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> does offer some level of security, the distinction between different levels of public access is required for a more accurate and fine-grained definition of the security policy...|$|R

40|$|We {{compute the}} quiver of any monoid {{that has a}} basic algebra over an algebraically closed field of {{characteristic}} zero. More generally, we reduce the computation of the quiver over <b>a</b> <b>splitting</b> field <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> monoids that we term rectangular monoids (in the semigroup theory literature the class is known as DO) to representation theoretic computations for group algebras of maximal subgroups. Hence in good characteristic for the maximal subgroups, this gives an essentially complete computation. Since groups are examples of rectangular monoids, we cannot hope {{to do better than}} this. For the subclass of R-trivial monoids, we also provide a semigroup theoretic description of the projective indecomposables and compute the Cartan matrix. Comment: Minor corrections and improvements to exposition were made. Some theorem statements were simplified. Also we made a language change. Several of our results are more naturally expressed using the language of Karoubi envelopes and irreducible morphisms. There are no substantial changes in actual result...|$|R

40|$|The <b>splitting</b> number <b>of</b> <b>a</b> link is {{the minimal}} number of {{crossing}} changes between different components required {{to convert it}} into a split link. We obtain a lower bound on the splitting number {{in terms of the}} (multivariable) signature and nullity. Although very elementary and easy to compute, this bound turns out to be suprisingly efficient. In particular, it makes it a routine check to recover the <b>splitting</b> number <b>of</b> 129 out of the 130 prime links with at most 9 crossings. Also, we easily determine 16 <b>of</b> the 17 <b>splitting</b> numbers that were studied by Batson and Seed using Khovanov homology, and later computed by Cha, Friedl and Powell using <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> techniques.
