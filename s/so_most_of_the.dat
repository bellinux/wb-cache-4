5|$|The {{stainless}} steel cladding is ribbed and riveted {{in the shape of}} sunbeams, with many triangular windows. Due to the curved shape of the dome, the Nirosta sheets had to be measured on site, <b>so</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work was carried out in workshops on the building's 67th and 75th floors.|$|E
5|$|The first {{qualifying}} session began {{under the}} threat of rain, <b>so</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teams tried to set a good lap time before the conditions deteriorated. The Audis and Peugeots swapped the overall pole position several times, {{and at the end}} of the session the No. 1 Audi was fastest overall with a time of 3.28.301. The No. 33 Barazi-Epsilon Zytek led LMP2, after an earlier misfiring problem had been repaired. Oreca's Saleens were the fastest two GT1 cars, while Ferrari and Porsche were close to one another in GT2. The session was red flagged about halfway through because of an accident in which the No. 53 JLOC Lamborghini Murciélago, driven by Marco Apicella, hit the wall at the first Mulsanne chicane. The No. 25 Ray Mallock Ltd. Lola and No. 81 LNT Panoz were the only cars not to set a lap time before the session briefly returned to green as rain began. The ACO extended the session by fifteen minutes to compensate for the earlier red flag.|$|E

25|$|The Second World War {{was from}} 1939 to 1945, <b>so</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{importance}} has dropped. There {{probably would have}} been an increase in wagon sheet production. It is thought that there is also damage again on the water tower {{at the back of the}} site.|$|E
25|$|The Amazon River is {{extremely}} wide {{for most of}} its length, <b>so</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dams are located on its tributaries. The Tucurui dam, located on the Tocantins River in the Northeastern region, has a capacity of 110 BCM and a generating capacity of 8,000MW.|$|E
25|$|The inexistence of {{nationwide}} gendarmerie, {{meant that}} the Army would partially be employed in that role, mainly {{in the rural areas}} of the country. <b>So,</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Army units were frequently requested by the local administrative authorities to maintain public order and to perform other police duties, employing in these services an important part of their personnel.|$|E

25|$|During the First Balkan War the kingdoms of Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria and Montenegro {{aspired to}} {{incorporate}} the entire region into their states (completely denying the Albania's independence), <b>so</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captured territory was occupied by their armies.

25|$|The revolutionary {{government}} {{seized the}} charitable foundations {{that had been}} set up (starting in the 13th century) to provide an annual stream of revenue for hospitals, poor relief, and education.

25|$|Given the {{irregularity}} {{of precipitation}} and geological {{conditions on the}} island, dam construction has been avoided, <b>so</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water (90 percent) comes from wells and from water galleries (Horizontal tunnels bored into the volcano) {{of which there are}} thousands on the island, important systems that serve to extract its hydrological resources. These tunnels are very hazardous, with pockets of volcanic gas or carbon dioxide, causing rapid death.|$|E

25|$|First anglicisisms in {{the written}} sources of Latvian appear {{at the end of}} the 18th century, however up until the middle 1970s they were barely {{researched}} as their number remained low and mostly in the fields of sports and engineering.

25|$|In Centreville and Eastern Loudoun County, SR 620 {{is a major}} {{commuter}} route, as it empties onto SR 28 (Sully Rd.), {{which in}} turn has a nearby interchange with Interstate 66. SR 620 also has major junctions with SR 123, the Fairfax County Parkway, and Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway). It has {{a very large number of}} residential neighborhoods lining the road, <b>so</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remainder is also a major commuter artery. The length and positioning of the highway attract motorists that are traveling from one part of Fairfax County to another.|$|E
25|$|The Imperial German Navy only {{carried out}} 12 bombardments of British coastal targets during World War I, <b>so</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{extensive}} coastal defences were never tested. Many of the trained men in these defences {{were transferred to}} meet the desperate need for heavy and siege gun units overseas, particularly on the Western Front. Kent was, however, {{an exception to the}} inactivity, and the ports of Margate, Broadstairs, Ramsgate and Dover were bombarded in April 1917 (the Second Battle of the Dover Strait), and Dover was shelled again (the last such bombardment of the war) on 16 February 1918. The batteries at Ramsgate and Dover were engaged on these occasions.|$|E
25|$|Most {{scholars}} {{would now}} {{agree that the}} official verdict of the inquest was to some extent untrue, concluding that Marlowe's stabbing was not done in self-defence, as claimed by the witnesses, but was a deliberate murder. Of those books or articles written about—or including an explanation of—Marlowe's death {{over the past twenty}} years or <b>so,</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authors believe that the witnesses were probably lying. Usually they suggest that it was a political murder, citing the fact that the two witnesses, Robert Poley and Nicholas Skeres, were or had been agents in the pay of members of the government. Some commentators have found details of the killing itself unconvincing.|$|E

25|$|Some company {{directors}} {{questioned the}} wisdom of acquiring extensive rail systems in northern New York State. A direct line to Albany, New York existed for many years through the canal and river system, <b>so</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coal markets in the area were already accessible. These concerns were overruled by the majority, who believed there would be great benefit to having an all rail route to Upstate New York that {{was not nearly as}} vulnerable to winter weather as the canal. It was also desirable to avoid situations in which the company would have to rely on other railroads to reach its markets. The effort was helped by a report that estimated necessary upgrades to the canal would cost $300,000, an expenditure that would not be needed if rail routes could be purchased or leased.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, the General Dynamics F-111 {{arrived at}} Upper Heyford. In 1978 {{the first of}} about 120 A-10 Thunderbolt II {{aircraft}} arrived at RAF Bentwaters/Woodbrige. Originally six squadrons {{were assigned to the}} 81st TFW, however later two squadrons were moved to the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Alconbury. Close Air Support missions made the A-10 vulnerable to ground fire, <b>so</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underside of the aircraft is made of armoured titanium. To stay out of reach of hostile radar, many of the A-10's missions were flown at nearly ground level. The A-10s in the UK were painted in a special camouflage scheme designed for European weather conditions, made from a special type of paint that can absorb 60% of the sun's rays. Because different densities of paint were used, its colors tended to change in different light conditions.|$|E
25|$|The French Revolution {{abolished}} many of {{the constraints}} on the economy that had slowed growth during the ancien regime. It abolished tithes owed to local churches as well as feudal dues owed to local landlords. The result hurt the tenants, who paid both higher rents and higher taxes. It nationalised all church lands, as well as lands belonging to royalist enemies who went into exile. It planned to use these seized lands to finance the government by issuing assignats. It abolished the guild system as a worthless remnant of feudalism. It also abolished the highly inefficient system of tax farming, whereby private individuals would collect taxes for a hefty fee. The government seized the foundations {{that had been set}} up (starting in the 13th century) to provide an annual stream of revenue for hospitals, poor relief, and education. The state sold the lands but typically local authorities did not replace the funding and <b>so</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation's charitable and school systems were massively disrupted.|$|E
5000|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this Hungarian {{keyboard}} layout is <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 0 (zero): it’s located to <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1, <b>so</b> that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accented characters can be together on <b>the</b> right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> keyboard.|$|R
