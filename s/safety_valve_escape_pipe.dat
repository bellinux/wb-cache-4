40|$|Writing from {{gender and}} {{organizational}} perspectives, this article reflects consciously with nuances upon varied effort working towards resolving the long existing binary barriers {{in the world}} of work. Working towards this goal, this article raises questions as to which organizational practices, processes, and procedures function to create participatory barriers to women in Ghanaian mine jobs. Adopting a mixed method design, the paper points to the culture of male dominance, gender biases, role models and mentorship constraints, unfriendly family work policies, and the relationship among women in male-dominated settings. These outcomes, according to the study, constitute a considerable concern for organizational development, with practical implications for industry, employment, labor relation practices, and public policy in Ghana. Therefore affirmative action among others is recommended for gender deconstruction, and promotion of gender democracy, an agenda for inclusivity, and a <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> for poverty <b>escapes</b> and a compact for achieving gender equality in multinational Ghanaian mines. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{boiler barrel}} was {{built up in}} three rings, {{arranged}} telescopically, with the smallest diameter at the firebox end.

40|$|Congress {{passed the}} <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> to {{mitigate}} the disparate and often harsh sentences mandatory minimums impose on low-level drug defendants. But judicial interpretation continues to impose disparate sentences. In 2014, in United States v. Acevedo-Fitz, the Seventh Circuit reaffirmed its position in an ongoing circuit split regarding the <b>safety</b> <b>valve.</b> The <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> requires defendants to meet five criteria, the fifth—sometimes called {{the heart of the}} safety valve—requires defendants provide complete truthful disclosure to prosecutors prior to sentencing. Judges interpret this requirement as imposing a burden on defendants to prove they met all five criteria without requiring the government to prove a defendant failed to provide complete truthful disclosure. The circuit split regards whether a defendant may lie before telling the truth and still qualify for the <b>safety</b> <b>valve.</b> The Seventh Circuit holds one lie precludes <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> relief. It imposes an additional restriction, essentially adding a prerequisite that defendants substantially assist prosecutors. However, Congress passed the <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> because the substantial assistance provision failed to assist low-level defendants, and the plain language of the <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> imposes no requirements that the truthful disclosure assist the government. This reading frustrates Congressional intent, as many other circuits recognize. To comport with Congressional intent, the Seventh Circuit should utilize a plain-language reading of the statute, and not superimpose a substantial assistance prerequisite on the fifth element of the <b>safety</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal design of an emissions trading program {{that includes a}} <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> tax that allows pollution sources to escape the emissions cap imposed by the aggregate supply of emissions permits.

While the expected level of emissions under a hybrid policy may {{be more or less}} than under pure emissions trading or a pure emissions tax, under the assumption that uncertainty about aggregate marginal abatement costs is symmetric the most likely outcome is that emissions {{will turn out to be}} less under the hybrid. Finally, a steeper expected marginal damage function calls for higher permit supply and <b>safety</b> <b>valve,</b> which reduces expected aggregate emissions and the probability that the <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> will be employed.
