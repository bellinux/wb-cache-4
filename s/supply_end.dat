50|$|Koberger was {{the godfather}} of Albrecht Dürer, whose family lived on the same street. In the year before Dürer's birth in 1471 he ceased goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher. He quickly became the most {{successful}} publisher in Germany, absorbing his rivals {{over the years to}} become a large capitalist enterprise, with twenty-four presses in operation, printing numerous works simultaneously and employing at its height 100 workers: printers, typesetters, typefounders, illuminators, and the like. Constantly improving his business prospects, he sent out traveling agents and established links with booksellers all over Western Europe, including Venice, Europe's other great centre of printing, Milan, Paris, Lyon, Vienna and Budapest. At the <b>supply</b> <b>end,</b> he obtained two papermills.|$|E
50|$|The astable configuration, {{with two}} resistors, cannot produce a 50% duty cycle. To produce a 50% duty cycle, {{eliminate}} R1, disconnect pin 7 and connect the <b>supply</b> <b>end</b> of R2 to pin 3, the output pin. This circuit {{is similar to}} using an inverter gate as an oscillator, but with fewer components than the astable configuration, and a much higher power output than a TTL or CMOS gate. The duty cycle for either the 555 or inverter-gate timer will not be precisely 50% and will change based off any load that the output is also driving while high (longer duty cycles for greater loads) {{due to the fact}} the timing network is supplied from the devices output pin, which has different internal resistances depending on whether it is in the high or low state (high side drivers tend to be more resistive).|$|E
50|$|A raceway is {{most often}} a {{rectangular}} canal with a water current flowing from a <b>supply</b> <b>end</b> to an exit end. The length to width ratio is important in raceways. To prevent the fish stock from swimming in circular movements, which would cause debris to build up in the centre, a length to width ratio of at least six to one is recommended. If the width is too large this {{could result in a}} feeble current speed which is not desirable (see below). The length of a raceway unit is usually constrained by the water quality or by how much stock a unit can hold for ease of management. The average depth of a raceway for fin fish, such as rainbow trout, is about one metre. This means each section in a raceway should be about 30 m long and 2.5-3 m wide. The landscape should sloped to one or two percent, so the flow through the system can be maintained by gravity. The raceway should not be curved, so the flow will be uniform.|$|E
50|$|The council {{took place}} {{soon after the}} {{conclusion}} of the war between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire, waged by Emperor Julian. Julian, the last Constantinian emperor, attempted a revival of paganism and resumed discrimination against Christians.

Jovian, in a precarious position, far from <b>supplies,</b> <b>ended</b> the war with Persia unfavorably for Rome.

The Nigerian Civil War began as the official Nigerian government side (predominated by soldiers from the North and West) attacked Biafra (Southeastern) on 6 July 1967 at Garkem. The 30-month war, with a long siege of Biafra and its isolation from trade and <b>supplies,</b> <b>ended</b> in January 1970. Estimates of the number of dead in the former Eastern Region are between 1 and 3 million people, from warfare, disease, and starvation, during the 30-month civil war.|$|R
