40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} by means of rigorous simulations with an operational software system that multilateration of the GEOS- 3 satellite is possible. This operation, i. e., the processing of simultaneous range measurements from the satellite to a real world constellation of stations using strictly geometric reduction of the observables, {{will result in the}} determination of the interstation coordinates to accuracies approaching those of the data measurements obtained at the stations. The <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> <b>link</b> between the GEOS- 3 and ATS- 6 can be used to further enhance the station covariance matrix...|$|E
40|$|PSAT is the 6 th U. S. Naval Academy student {{engineering}} Amateur Satellite project since 2001. It remains {{fully operational}} and successful for over 18 months in space since the launch in May 2015. PSAT {{is an example}} of the academy’s student satellite development projects, designed specifically for the Amateur Satellite Service for the student’s education and self-training at the undergraduate level in the radio/satellite technology. PSAT uses passive radiometric torque from a differential black/white color scheme to induce spacecraft spin on-orbit for passive thermal balancing and consistent charging (in parallel) of individual battery cells which are then used in series to provide appropriate spacecraft bus voltage. This paper summarizes the first 18 months of 58, 000 telemetry and 22, 000 user downlink packets collected by the worldwide network of volunteer, internet-linked ground stations that all feed the live downlink web page: [URL] This summary yields statistics on various telemetry and data types, the total number of users and their worldwide distribution, the total number of ground stations, as well as any <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> <b>link</b> data. The telemetry also reveals the success of the passive spin stabilized attitude and thermal control system including the spacecraft response to the mission loads and the space environment...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} the main results {{achieved}} in the framework of COST 271 Action Working Group 4, under the activities of the Work Package 4. 4. The first topic treated deals with the influence of ionospheric space and time gradients in the slant to vertical and vertical to slant ionospheric delay conversion when the thin shell approximation of the ionosphere is assumed and with the effects of geomagnetic activity on the errors that this conversion introduces. The second topic is related to the comparison of ionospheric topside models with experimental electron density profiles to check the ability of the models to reproduce the observed topside shape and characteristics that determine the electron density gradients. The analysis that has been done allows pointing out the changes needed to improve the models. Finally a third topic covers a model simulation study of the total electron content that can be encountered in GPS-to-geostationary satellite ray paths. It takes into account that the propagation paths for such <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> <b>links</b> are very long and they have the potential to intersect regions of the ionised atmosphere where the electron density is high when the geometry is close to eclipse...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the benefits of}} navigating a crewed vehicle between the Earth and the Moon using both ground tracking and <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking. <b>Linked</b> Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAISON) is a new technique that {{has been shown to}} dramatically improve the navigation of lunar satellites, libration orbiters, and Earth orbiting satellites using scalar intersatellite observations. In this paper, LiAISON is applied to the problem of navigating a crewed vehicle to the Moon. It has been found that LiAISON observations improve the navigation accuracy enough {{to reduce the number of}} active ground tracking stations from six to three...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—An {{analytical}} {{model for the}} description of the electromag-netic waves propagation in a layered medium consisting of sectors hav-ing the locally spherical symmetric distributions of refractivity is in-troduced. Model presents analytical expressions for the phase path and refractive attenuation of electromagnetic waves. Influence of the inclined ionospheric layers is a cause of the ionospheric interference in the trans-ionospheric communication <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> or satellite-to-Earth <b>links.</b> It follows from the {{analytical model}} that the identifica-tion of the inclined ionospheric layers contributions and measurements of their location and parameters may be fulfilled by use of compara-tive analysis of the amplitude variations and the eikonal acceleratio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the Rendezvous Radar Set (RRS) for the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle (OMV) for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The RRS was to be used to locate, and then provide vectoring information to, target satellites (or Shuttle or Space Station) to aid the OMV in making a minimum-fuel-consumption approach and rendezvous. The RRS design is that of an X-Band, all solid-state, monopulse tracking, frequency hopping, pulse-Doppler radar system. The development of the radar was terminated when the OMV prime contract to TRW was terminated by NASA. At the time of the termination, the development was in the circuit design stage. The system design was virtually completed, the PDR had been held. The RRS design was based on Motorola's experiences, both in the design and production of radar systems for the US Army and in the design and production of hi-rel communications systems for NASA space programs. Experience in these fields was combined with the latest digital signal processor and micro-processor technology to design a light-weight, low-power, spaceborne radar. The antenna and antenna positioner (gimbals) technology developed for the RRS is now being used in the <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> communication <b>link</b> design for Motorola's Iridium telecommunications system...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the ATS-F/Nimbus-E tracking experiment, {{the first of its}} kind, is presented. Specifically, this experiment has a twofold purpose: first, to gain experience in the practical use of satellite-to-satellite range and range rate data for very accurate orbit determination (this was its original intent); and second, to evaluate the real usefulness of such a technique for geodetic studies {{despite the fact that the}} 1000 -km Nimbus orbit is not ideally suited for such a purpose. The accuracies of the tracking systems of the <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> and satellite-to-ground <b>link</b> (ATS-F to the Rosman, N. C. ground station) will be about 0. 035 cm/sec in range rate and about 1 m in range - utilizing a 10 sec integration time. With these values it is possible to obtain, based upon performed error analyses, orbit height errors of the order of 0. 1 to 0. 3 m for the near earth orbiting Nimbus spacecraft. This experiment will therefore hopefully prove to be a significant first step for future earth applications spacecraft carrying altimeters systems for measuring ocean height variations...|$|R
