5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of an inning during which runs are scored after an error or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate {{the events of the}} inning without the errors or passed balls. If in the official scorer's opinion a run would not have scored without the defensive lapses, then the run is unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would have scored anyway, the run is earned and charged to the pitcher. In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by an error, the second batter hits a home run, and the next three batters <b>strike</b> <b>out,</b> then one of the two runs which were scored are unearned. There are rules and restrictions which govern this general guideline.|$|E

He was the only Twin on the squad and pitched a perfect seventh inning, getting Bobby Abreu to <b>strike</b> <b>out,</b> Mike Lowell to fly out and Miguel Cabrera to <b>strike</b> <b>out.</b> His numbers were impressive through the rest of the season, allowing no runs between June 9 and August 18, and between August 25 and September 16. and finishing 2004 with 44 saves in 47 opportunities and an ERA of 1.62. The Twins won the AL Central division and faced the New York Yankees in the ALDS. Nathan picked up his first postseason save in Game 1, but blew his second opportunity in Game 2 as the Twins went on to lose the ensuing three games.
