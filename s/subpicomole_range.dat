40|$|A liquid {{chromatography}} method with mass spectrometric detection {{has been developed}} for the simultaneous determination of six thiols in the sulfur metabolic pathway, including cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (HCys), glutathione (GSH), cysteinyl-glycine (Cys-Gly), 3 Ì†b 3 -glutamyl-cysteine (Glu-Cys), and S-adenosyl-homocysteine (AdoHcy). Tris(2 -carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) {{was used as the}} reducing reagent and p-(hydroxymercuri) benzoate (PHMB) as the derivatization reagent. Thiols were extracted from 3 mg of yeast using water in an ultrasonic bath. The absolute detection limits for the compounds studied were in the <b>subpicomole</b> <b>range.</b> It was found that AdoHcy, Cys, GSH, Cys-Gly, Glu-Cys, and very little HCys were present in the selenium-enriched yeast sample studied, and GSH, Glu-Cys, very little AdoHcy, Cys, and Cys-Gly were present in three bakery yeasts.
