5|$|Initial {{development}} on WoA took place by porting code from Windows 7; Windows Mobile smartphones {{were used to}} test early builds of WoA {{because of lack of}} readily available ARM-based tablets. Later testing was performed using a custom-designed array of rack-mounted ARM-based systems. Changes to the Windows codebase were made to optimize the OS for the internal hardware of ARM devices, but a number of technical standards traditionally used by x86 systems are also used. WoA devices would use UEFI firmware, and have a software-based Trusted Platform Module to <b>support</b> <b>device</b> encryption and UEFI Secure Boot. ACPI is also used to detect and control plug and play devices and provide power management outside the SoC. To enable wider hardware support, peripherals such as human interface devices, storage and other components that use USB and I²C connections use class drivers and standardized protocols. Windows Update serves as the mechanism for updating all system drivers, software, and firmware.|$|E
25|$|Since late 2001, a {{head and}} neck {{restraint}} has been required for usage of all drivers. Since 2005 the HANS Device (Head and Neck <b>Support</b> <b>Device)</b> {{has been the only}} such approved device. Since 2003, helmets have been required for pit crew members as well. Drivers and pit crew members must also wear firesuits. Drivers are required to use carbon fiber seats and headrests for strength and durability. Cars have also been redesigned since the 2001 death of Dale Earnhardt and after spectacular crashes to reflect new discoveries and developments in safety.|$|E
500|$|In October 1996 FIA {{set about}} researching a driver {{restraint}} system for head-on impacts, {{in conjunction with}} McLaren and Mercedes-Benz. Mercedes contacted the makers of the HANS (Head and Neck <b>Support)</b> <b>device,</b> {{with a view to}} adapting it for Formula One. The HANS device was first released in 1991 and was designed to restrain the head and neck {{in the event of an}} accident to avoid basal skull fracture, the injury which killed Ratzenberger. [...] Initial tests proved successful, and at the 2000 San Marino Grand Prix the final report was released which concluded that the HANS should be recommended for use. Its use was made compulsory from the start of the 2003 season.|$|E

2500|$|The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit {{reversed}} the District Court's judgment. The Appeals Court reasoned that, {{even though the}} law itself applied {{as a general rule}} to all persons, a fact that the District Court noted in determining its constitutionality, it did not treat all competent patients equally when they were near death and wished to end their lives. To this effect, the Appeals Court said that, for example, a patient attached to a life <b>support</b> <b>device</b> was allowed to require its removal, while a person under identical circumstances could not demand that a doctor administer drugs to ensure the patient's death. It agreed with the contention that removing life support devices was identical to requesting physician-assisted euthanasia, and thereby {{reversed the}} lower court's finding.|$|E
2500|$|Wearing a {{specialized}} garment designed to restrain a woman's breasts may {{date back to}} ancient Greece. Wall paintings in Crete, {{the center of the}} Minoan civilization, show a woman performing athletics in what {{has been described as a}} [...] "bikini". Minoan women on the island of Crete 3,000 years ago apparently wore garments that partially supported and also revealed their breasts; the best known example of this style is the Snake Goddess. Their clothing looked somewhat like modern fitted and laced corsets or a corselette. The <b>support</b> <b>device</b> was worn outside other clothing and supported and exposed the breasts, pushing them upwards and making them more visible. The succeeding Mycenae civilization emphasized the breast, which had a special cultural and religious significance, associating the mature figure with fertility and procreation.|$|E
50|$|In general {{there exists}} no {{standard}} for {{what constitutes a}} <b>supported</b> <b>device</b> in a specific product. This {{has led to the}} situation where different vendors define a <b>supported</b> <b>device</b> differently. A situation such as this makes it much harder to compare products based on vendor provided lists of <b>supported</b> <b>devices.</b> For instance a device where logical extraction using one product only produces a list of calls made by the device may be listed as supported by that vendor while another vendor can produce much more information.|$|R

2500|$|Although NASCAR {{frequently}} publicizes {{the safety}} measures it mandates for drivers, these features are often only adopted {{long after they}} were initially developed, and only {{in response to an}} injury or fatality. The impact-absorbing [...] "SAFER Barrier" [...] that is now in use had been proposed by legendary mechanic Smokey Yunick during the 1970s, but his idea had been dismissed as too expensive and unnecessary. Only after the deaths of Adam Petty, Kenny Irwin and Tony Roper in 2000, and Dale Earnhardt in 2001 did NASCAR revisit the idea of decreasing the G-forces a driver sustained during a crash. Other examples of available safety features that were slow to be implemented include the mandating of a throttle [...] "kill switch". The [...] "kill switch" [...] was mandated after the death of Adam Petty, along with the requirements of an anti-spill bladder in fuel cells. Fire-retardant driver suits were required only after the death of Glen [...] "Fireball" [...] Roberts, who died from complications of burns suffered in a crash when flames engulfed his car during a Charlotte race. Dale Earnhardt was killed after he received massive head and neck trauma from a hard crash in the 2001 Daytona 500. Earnhardt's death prompted NASCAR to require all drivers to use the [...] "HANS device" [...] (Head And Neck <b>Support</b> <b>Device),</b> a device that keeps the driver's neck from going forward in a wreck. In the mid-2000s, NASCAR redesigned the racing vehicle with safety improvements, calling it the Car of Tomorrow. The car has a higher roof, wider cockpit, and the driver seat was located more {{toward the center of the}} vehicle.|$|E
