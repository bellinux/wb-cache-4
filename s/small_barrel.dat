5|$|By {{the morning}} of 16 January, the seas were still rough, whilst hunger and panic had taken over on the wreck. When a large raft {{carrying}} the wounded, two women and six children was launched during a lull in the weather, over 120 unwounded men scrambled to board it. This severely overloaded the craft and within minutes a large wave struck the heavy raft and capsized it, drowning all aboard. By the evening, the remaining survivors, without food or fresh water, began to succumb to exposure, {{and at least one}} officer drowned {{in a desperate attempt to}} swim to shore. Throughout the night, the survivors gathered on the less exposed parts of the hull, and, in the hope of staving off death by dehydration, drank sea water, urine, or vinegar from a <b>small</b> <b>barrel</b> that had floated up from the hold. The morning of 17January finally saw a reduction in the storm and the arrival of a small French naval brig, the Arrogante. This ship could not come close without the risk of grounding but sent her boats to the wreck in the hope of rescuing survivors. The brig was joined later in the day by the cutter Aiguille.|$|E
5|$|Before 1897, {{there had}} been a ferry at Grovehill, and a {{shipyard}} on the east bank, owned by Joseph Scarr. To assist his workers to reach the shipyard, Scarr designed and built a ferry bridge, which cost him £300. It consisted of a large rectangular pontoon, above which was fitted a bridge deck with handrails. Two jack screws enabled the deck to be raised or lowered in relation to the pontoon, so that it remained at approximately the same height, whatever the state of the tide. On the eastern bank, Scarr constructed a variable-height landing, but the landing on the west bank was constructed by Beverley Council, and was fixed. Scarr campaigned to have a variable landing here as well, and was prepared to fund it, but his requests were always rejected. The fixed landing made access to the bridge difficult at high tides. When a boat needed to pass, the west end was freed, and the pontoon swung round to lie parallel to the bank, either upstream or downstream, depending {{on the state of the}} tide. It would then be winched back into position by a <b>small</b> <b>barrel</b> winch. At night the bridge was closed and moored beside the bank.|$|E

2500|$|The {{architecture}} at Anacostia is unusual. Due to cost {{considerations and}} the station's shallow depth, the usual arched ceiling was abandoned {{in favor of}} flat concrete walls and a ceiling of <b>small</b> <b>barrel</b> vaults (oriented perpendicular to the tracks) similar to the upper coffers in the six-coffer arch station design. The station is an underground stop because {{the distance between the}} Anacostia River tunnels and the station is too short to have permitted an above-ground stop. The station has entrances on both sides of DC-295/I-295 (Anacostia Freeway), which necessitated the construction of a slightly longer platform than would be necessary to accommodate trains. [...] In addition, there are no pylons at platform-level at Anacostia.|$|E

25|$|St. Bernards {{are often}} portrayed, {{especially}} in old live action comedies such as Swiss Miss, the TV series Topper, and classic cartoons, wearing <b>small</b> <b>barrels</b> of brandy around their necks. Avalanche victims supposedly drank the brandy {{to stay warm}} while awaiting rescue, although this is medically unsound. The monks of the St. Bernard Hospice deny that any St. Bernard has ever carried casks or <b>small</b> <b>barrels</b> around their necks; they attribute the image to an 1820 painting by Edwin Landseer, perhaps Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveler (which became a popular engraving in 1831 by Charles Landseer).

60|$|The work {{upon which}} he was, at present, engaged was the {{transferring}} {{of the provisions}} for the voyage from the quay to the hold. These consisted principally of barrels of salt meat, and bags of biscuits; {{but there were a}} large tin of tea, a keg of sugar, a <b>small</b> <b>barrel</b> of molasses--or treacle--two or three sacks of potatoes, pepper and salt. Then there was a barrel of oil for the lamps, coils of spare rope of different sizes, and a number of articles of whose use William Gale had not the most remote idea.|$|E
60|$|They {{observed}} that the sentries were not changed in any military way. Five minutes before sunset the four men who were to relieve those on guard came sauntering up. The former guard ordered the captives into the hut and bolted the door, and then after a short chat with the others went off, the new sentries having already taken their posts {{at the corners of}} the hut. On the fifth evening after their capture they saw approaching a peasant woman sitting on a mule. A man was walking beside her. Behind the woman was a <b>small</b> <b>barrel,</b> and two packs and two small wine-skins hung on each side.|$|E

40|$|Aims: Traditional Balsamic Vinegar {{has been}} made by the ageing of cooked grape must into wooden barrels {{arranged}} in set of 5 - 7 casks each of varying capacity. Every year a small amount of vinegar is transferred from a bigger to a <b>smaller</b> <b>barrel</b> and new cooked must is added to the first barrel of the set. In this way the sugary concentration is increased from the biggest to the <b>smallest</b> <b>barrel</b> due to water evaporation across the wood. Methods and results: Different molecular techniques were applied to study acetic acid bacteriain Traditional Balsamic Vinegar. In particular 16 S- 23 S- 5 S rDNA PCR/RFLP analysis, DGGE and sequencing techniques were performed on both acetic acid bacteria type strains and isolated strains from vinegars. Conclusion: Gluconacetobacter xylinus is the main species of Traditional Balsamic Vinegar and the greatest hurdle to the growth of acetic acid bacteria is high sugar concentration. Significance and impact of the study: The results suggest new technological approach to vinegar production...|$|R

60|$|May 1. In the morning, {{looking toward}} the sea-side, the tide being low, I saw {{something}} lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, {{and it looked like}} a cask: when I came to it, I found a <b>small</b> <b>barrel,</b> and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by the late hurricane; and looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to do. I examined the barrel that was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder; but it had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone: however, I rolled it farther on the shore for the present, and went on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look for more.|$|E
60|$|Inga {{stood for}} some moments gazing upon the {{handsome}} craft and wondering {{where it could}} have come from. Certainly it was unlike any boat he had ever seen. On the outside it was painted a lustrous black, without any other color to relieve it; but all {{the inside of the}} boat was lined with pure silver, polished so highly that the surface resembled a mirror and glinted brilliantly in the rays of the sun. The seats had white velvet cushions upon them and the cushions were splendidly embroidered with threads of gold. At one end, beneath the broad seat, was a <b>small</b> <b>barrel</b> with silver hoops, which the boy found was filled with fresh, sweet water. A great chest of sandalwood, bound and ornamented with silver, stood in {{the other end of the}} boat. Inga raised the lid and discovered the chest filled with sea-biscuits, cakes, tinned meats and ripe, juicy melons; enough good and wholesome food to last the party a long time.|$|E

60|$|The chamber {{in which}} the Doctor had {{established}} himself was a little octangular room, with walls of great thickness, within which were fabricated various issues, leading in different directions, and communicating with {{different parts of the}} building. Around him were packages with arms, and near him one <b>small</b> <b>barrel,</b> as it seemed, of gunpowder; many papers in different parcels, and several keys for correspondence in cipher; two or three scrolls covered with hieroglyphics were also beside him, which Albert took for plans of nativity; and various models of machinery, in which Dr. Rochecliffe was an adept. There were also tools of various kinds, masks, cloaks, and a dark lantern, {{and a number of other}} indescribable trinkets belonging to the trade of a daring plotter in dangerous times. Last, there was a casket with gold and silver coin of different countries, which was left carelessly open, as if it were the least of Dr. Rochecliffe's concern, although his habits in general announced narrow circumstances, if not actual poverty. Close by the divine's plate lay a Bible and Prayer-book, with some proof sheets, as they are technically called, seemingly fresh from the press. There was also within the reach of his hand a dirk, or Scottish poniard, a powder-horn, and a musketoon, or blunderbuss, with a pair of handsome pocket-pistols. In the midst of this miscellaneous collection, the Doctor sat eating his breakfast with great appetite, as little dismayed by the various implements of danger around him, as a workman is when accustomed to the perils of a gunpowder manufactory.|$|E

This cured me of alchemy, and fain would I have returned to the honest hammer and anvil; but who would bring a horse to be shod by the Devil's post? Meantime, I had won the regard of my honest Flibbertigibbet here, he being then at Farringdon with his master, the sage Erasmus Holiday, by teaching him a few secrets, such as please youth at his age; and after much counsel together, we agreed that, since I could get no practice in the ordinary way, I should try how I could work out business among these ignorant boors, by practising upon their silly fears; and, thanks to Flibbertigibbet, who hath spread my renown, I have not wanted custom. But it is won at too great risk, and I fear I shall be at length taken up for a wizard; so that I seek but an opportunity to leave this vault, when I can have the protection of some worshipful person against the fury of the populace, in case they chance to recognize me." ...|$|E

5000|$|A new {{technique}} being applied to barrel manufacture is electrical machining, {{in the form}} of Electrical discharge machining (EDM) or Electro chemical machining (ECM).

EDM is very costly and primarily used in large bore, long barrel cannon, where traditional methods are very difficult, while ECM is used by some <b>smaller</b> <b>barrel</b> makers.|$|R
