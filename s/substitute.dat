5|$|Since <b>substitute</b> {{checks are}} {{considered}} legal checks, <b>substitute</b> checks {{are subject to}} existing check laws and regulations. Other laws and regulations that govern <b>substitute</b> checks in the United States include the Expedited Funds Availability Act, Article3 (Negotiable Instruments), and Article4 (Bank Deposits and Collections) of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), along {{with a variety of}} state and federal regulatory laws. U.S. federal laws that also affect <b>substitute</b> checks include Federal Reserve regulations that provide for recrediting the amount of the <b>substitute</b> check in the case of fraud and duplicate payments caused by settlement of both the <b>substitute</b> check and the original check used for creating the <b>substitute</b> check. If any state law, federal law, or provision of the UCC conflicts with the Check21Act, the Check21Act takes precedence to the extent of the inconsistencies among those laws and provisions.|$|E

5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a <b>substitute</b> for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a <b>substitute</b> material. The first viable <b>substitute</b> was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E
