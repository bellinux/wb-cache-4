40|$|The {{last half}} of the 20 th century saw the {{emergence}} of a large literature that documents apparently “irrational” behavior in economics and psychology experiments. This has led to criticisms of economic methodology, particularly of structural econometric models that rely on the assumption of rational expectations. However, there has been almost no evidence provided as to whether, as a practical matter, assuming rational expectations generates misleading inference in structural econometric models. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the rational expectations assumption on inference about a single structural parameter using data from a laboratory price search experiment. Our novel experimental design induces preferences up to the subjective rate of time preference, leaving unrestricted only this parameter and the heuristics that subjects use in solving the search task. We analyze the experimental data under both rational expectations and weaker behavioral assumptions. The rational expectations assumption fits the data reasonably well, but the fit provided by <b>simpler</b> <b>reservation</b> price rules is better. Nevertheless, the two specifications provide consistent inferences about the central tendency of the population’s discount rate distribution.

40|$|A large {{variety of}} markets, such as retail markets for {{gasoline}} or mortgage markets, {{are characterized by}} {{a small number of}} firms offering a fairly homogenous product at virtually the same cost, while consumers, being uninformed about this cost, sequentially search for low prices.

We develop a sequential search model with incomplete information and characterize a perfect Bayesian equilibrium in which consumers follow <b>simple</b> <b>reservation</b> price strategies. Firms strategically exploit consumers being uninformed about their production cost, and set on average higher prices compared to the standard complete information model. Thus, consumer welfare is lower.

40|$|Abstract: Executing complex {{applications}} on Grid infrastructures necessitates the guaran-teed {{allocation of}} multiple resources. Such guarantees are often implemented {{by means of}} advance reservations. Reserving resources in advance requires multiple steps – beginning with their description to their actual allocation. In a Grid, a client possesses little knowl-edge about the future status of resources. Thus, manually specifying successful parameters of a co-reservation is a tedious task. Instead, we propose to parametrize certain reservation characteristics (e. g., the start time) and to let a client define criteria for selecting appropri-ate values. Then, a Grid reservation service processes such requests by determining the future status of resources and calculating a co-reservation candidate which satisfies the cri-teria. In this paper, we present the <b>Simple</b> <b>Reservation</b> Language (SRL) for describing the requests, demonstrate the transformation of an example request into an integer program us-ing the Zuse Institute Mathematical Programming Language (ZIMPL) and experimentally evaluate {{the time needed to}} find the optimal co-reservation using CPLEX. ...|$|E

40|$|In a {{real-time}} wireless TDMA environment, every packet (information unit) {{generated by}} the applications has a deadline associated with it. If the system cannot allocate enough resources to serve the packet before the deadline, the packet would experience excess delay {{and it would be}} dropped. Different applications have different delay requirements depending {{on the nature of the}} individual applications. The delay requirements should all be guaranteed by the system so as to maintain some given packet dropping probabilities. Meanwhile, handoff is another important issue in the wireless environment, in which call blocking/dropping probabilities are the main concerns. This thesis is divided into two parts. In the first part, the single-cell system traffic of multiple delay classes is mathematically analyzed, and it is proved to be independent on the scheduling algorithm used, for all work-conserving earliest-due-date (WC-EDD) scheduling algorithm. The dropping requirements of all individual applications are guaranteed using deadline-sensitive ordered-head-of-line (DSO-HoL) priority schemes. In the second part of the thesis, the multiple-cell extension is discussed, in which, a handoff model is suggested to provide an integration between call level and packet level quality-of-service (QoS). <b>Simple</b> bandwidth <b>reservation</b> schemes are used for analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel slotted Dual-Channel Reservation (DCR) MAC {{protocol}} that uses 802. 11 primitives for providing both Quality of Service (QoS) and fairness. RTS/CTS handshaking is transmitted on a separated control channel to prevent successive collisions of RTS and CTS packets with existing data transmission. Furthermore, contention for channel access may be initiated by sender {{as well as}} receiver depending on the channel status for better fairness. A <b>simple</b> slot <b>reservation</b> algorithm in the data channel provides high efficiency. The main conclusion is that reservation access benefits both delay performance, and efficiency as well as fairness—the reason being that not only an exposed terminal can regain the channel more easily because of dramatically reduced contention (RTS-CTS) traffic, but also a hidden terminal receives less collisions in handshaking since any node winning a slot will quit contending on the control channel. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use reservation access even if the prevailing traffic is data, e. g. TCP. To enhance delay performance, we devise a fake packet repeating mechanism that can reserve the slot for a connection even if the user temporarily has no packets to transmit. Simulations based on key metrics—throughput, fairness index and mean delay are performed to validate the new protocol and quantify its advantages. The limitations of the proposed DCR- 802. 11 protocol due to need for global clock synchronization and dual channels are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Wavelength Routing (WR) and Optical Burst Switching (OBS) are two {{optical network}} {{techniques}} that have received enormous attention {{over the last}} decade. However, the two techniques are plagued with many problems. The main concern with WR is the inefficient bandwidth utilization.

In this paper, we propose a new scheme to share network resources using Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) instead of the statistical multiplexing employed in optical burst switching. To avoid contention and improve bandwidth utilization, we resort to a <b>simple</b> <b>reservation</b> scheme that guarantees timeslot deliveries. In addition, we propose the deployment of a new device that we call Sequencer, a simplified form of Optical Time Slot Interchangers (OTSIs), to assist in mapping incoming timeslots to some available outgoing ones. Our goal is to achieve a contention free network, and improve performance. Many classes of traffic can coexist in our network by adjusting the bandwidth allocation parameters. 1...|$|E

40|$|Optical Burst Switching (OBS) is {{considered}} to enable bandwidth {{in the context of}} an Agile All-Photonic Network (AAPN). However, before deploying the OBS technique in the AAPN backbone, one must consider the best way to aggregate the variable length packets into burst of suitable size.

In this work, we developed an analytical model, which models the probability distribution function of aggregation delays for different types of burst aggregation methods. The presented model is numerically evaluated using MATLAB code. The accuracy of the analytical model is verified by OpNet simulation. The impact of different types of burst aggregation methods and associated parameters (e. g. threshold-value and time-out value) on blocking probability and mean delays is also investigated. Another major concern in optical burst switched network is contention, which occurs when more than two bursts are destined to the same output port at the same time.

40|$|For {{some time}} now, {{the design of}} {{architectures}} for providing dependable Quality of Service (QoS) on multimedia networks has been a busy topic in academia and industry. In this work we look at practical aspects of Quality of Service, and in particular at resource reservation for the Internet. Initially, our focus was on ATM, which looked like the most promising QoS technology at the time. We proposed, implemented, and demonstrated Arequipa, a mechanism that uses ATM to provide QoS for TCP/IP, and which only requires end-to-end connectivity, but no changes in the ATM network. While ATM still has its place, the Differentiated Services architecture, which returns to the paradigm of packet-oriented processing in the network, is nowadays a more likely candidate for providing a basis for supporting dependable Quality of Service in the Internet. We therefore concentrated on Differentiated Services when looking for solutions to overcome {{some of the problems}} we found in the reservation models in Arequipa and the underlying ATM. Our work culminates in the development of SRP, the "Scalable resource Reservation Protocol", a highly scalable yet conceptually <b>simple</b> <b>reservation</b> protocol for TCP/IP. SRP achieves scalability by aggregating flows in the network, and by controlling flow admission by making simple per-packet decisions, which are based on estimates of the bandwidth available for reservation. We give {{a detailed description of the}} SRP architecture, including examples of estimation algorithms and an introduction to a novel approach for scalable policing. We describe how we integrated SRP in the ns simulator, and show simulation results. Finally, we have implemented SRP on top of Differentiated Services on Linux, and again we describe the implementation and give measurement results. We also discuss some of the infrastructure-building activities that have resulted from our work, namely the ATM on Linux project, documentation of Linux traffic control, and the Diffserv on Linux project...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{itself with}} optimal learning through experimentation by microeconomic agents. The first part presents {{a model of}} a search process for the best outcome of many multi-stage projects. The branching structure of the search environment is such that the pay-offs to various actions are correlated; nevertheless, it is shown that the optimal strategy is given by a <b>simple</b> <b>reservation</b> price rule. A simple model of R&D is provided as an example. These general results are then applied in a model of job search and occupational choice in which jobs are grouped into occupations in a natural way. Before getting a job, the agent must first become qualified in the chosen occupation, at which point his general aptitude for jobs in this occupation is revealed. The search environment is such that the returns of jobs are correlated within a given occupation, but the optimal strategy is given by the above reservation value rule. One implication of this is that young inexperienced workers prefer to try riskier jobs/occupations first. Issues of job turnover and expected returns are addressed. The second part studies optimal experimentation by a monopolist who faces an unknown demand curve subject to random changes, and who maximises profits over an infinite horizon in continuous time. Two qualitatively very different regimes emerge, determined by the discount rate and the intensities of demand curve switching, and the dependence of the optimal policy on these parameters is discontinuous. One regime is characterised by extreme experimentation and good tracking of the prevailing demand curve, the other by moderate experimentation and poor tracking. Moreover, in the latter regime the agent eventually becomes ‘trapped’ into taking actions in a strict subset of the feasible set. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In our {{previous}} work we defined an approach based on symbolic transition system and data type to specify and verify mixed systems. We applied this to components and architectures with full data types, and synchronous communications. However to fit distributed systems, {{it seems more}} real-istic to consider asynchronous communications. It provides a more primitive communication protocol and maximize the concurrency. To take into account asynchronous communications we distinguish mes-sage receipt from message execution and we add mailboxes in our symbolic systems. When we tried to experiment proofs in such a system a difficulty was the presence of buffers {{and the fact that}} the receipt instant is distinct from the execution instant. This complicates the specifications and also the proofs. The main problem is that the logic instant to receive is not simply linked with the execution instant. We propose to use an algorithm which decides if the system has bounded mailboxes and computes the reachable mailbox contents of the system. This algorithm gives constraints which are used to specialised the dynamic behaviour of the components according to the current system configuration. Then we are able to generate a PVS specification coping with dynamic behaviour and data type which is simpler since it removes the need for some mailboxes. The component model, the algorithms and the proofs are illustrated on a <b>simple</b> flight system <b>reservation...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{dependence}} on past choices of present opportunities, costs, and benefits is pervasive in industrial markets. Each {{of the three}} chapters of this thesis considers a different example of such dependence affecting dynamic behaviour. In the first chapter a single firm's present choices depend on what it has learnt from past experience. The firm is searching for the best outcome of many multi-stage projects and learns as stages are completed. The branching structure of the search environment is such that the payoffs to various actions are correlated; nevertheless, it is shown that the optimal strategy is given by a <b>simple</b> <b>reservation</b> price rule. The chapter provides a simple model of R&D as an example. In the central model of the second chapter firms slowly build up stocks of goodwill through advertising. While many firms start to advertise in a new market, over time a successful set emerges and the others exit. The chapter explores the relative growth of firms and {{the determination of the}} number of successful ones. The chapter compares the results to those of a model in which a firm must complete all of a given number of R&D stages before being able to produce. The final chapter considers one of the effects of urban bus deregulation in the UK: bus arrival times are changed very frequently. It is assumed that passengers do not know the timetable and once at a stop board the first bus to arrive. There can be no equilibrium in which an operator's bus arrival times are never revised: otherwise those of a rival would arrive just before and take all the waiting passengers. The chapter considers the pattern of revisions when they are costly. The chapter also shows that fares can be higher with two competing operators than with a single monopolist...|$|E
