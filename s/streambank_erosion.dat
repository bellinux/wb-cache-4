40|$|The Minnesota River Valley {{was carved}} during catastrophic {{drainage}} of glacial Lake Agassiz {{at the end}} of the late Pleistocene. The ensuing base-level drop on tributaries created knickpoints that excavated deep valleys as they migrated upstream. A sediment budget compiled in one of these tributaries, the Le Sueur River, shows that these deep valleys are now the primary source of sediment to the Minnesota River. To compare modern sediment loads with pre-European settlement erosion rates, we analyzed incision history using fluvial terrace ages to constrain a valley incision model. Results indicate that even though the dominant sediment sources are derived from natural sources (bluffs, ravines, and <b>streambanks),</b> <b>erosion</b> rates have increased substantially, due in part to pervasive changes in watershed hydrology...|$|R

40|$|This NebGuide {{describes}} bioengineering {{techniques for}} hillslope, <b>streambank</b> and lakeshore <b>erosion</b> control. Tips {{for a successful}} bioengineering installation and demonstration project are described. Soil erosion occurs whenever water meets land with enough force to move soil. Often this occurs along streambanks and lakeshores or where excess water flows over hillslopes. While <b>streambank</b> and hillslope <b>erosion</b> can be dramatic, especially after large rainfalls or floods, normal streamflows, excess runoff from urbanized areas and wave action along lakeshores continually erode soil. Erosion can be severe, {{as is the case}} in many man-made lakes, where shorelines are composed of easily erodible soil. Traditional methods of controlling streamflow and wave induced erosion have relied on structural practices like rip rap, retaining walls and sheet piles. In many cases these methods are expensive, ineffective or socially unacceptable. An alternative approach is bioengineering, a method of construction using live plants alone or combined with dead or inorganic materials, to produce living, functioning systems to prevent erosion, control sediment and provide habitat. Bioengineering uses combinations of structural practices and live vegetation to provide erosion protection for hillslopes, streambanks and lakeshores. Bioengineering is a diverse and multi-disciplinary field, requiring the knowledge of engineers, botanists, horticulturalists, hydrologists, soil scientists and construction contractors. It is a rapidly growing field, subject to innovations and changing design specifications. Terms such as biotechnical erosion control, biostabilization or soil-bioengineering are often used synonymously with bioengineering...|$|R

Interpretive Summary Livestock grazing has damaged approximately 80 % of stream and riparian ecosystems in the western United States. Although these areas compose only 0. 5 - 1. 0 % of the overall landscape, a disproportionately large percentage (~ 70 - 80 %) of all desert, shrub, and grassland plants and animals depend on them. The introduction of livestock into these areas 100 - 200 years ago caused a disturbance with many ripple effects. Livestock seek out water, succulent forage, and shade in riparian areas, leading to trampling and overgrazing of <b>streambanks,</b> soil <b>erosion,</b> loss of <b>streambank</b> stability, declining water quality, and drier, hotter conditions. These changes have reduced habitat for riparian plant species, cold-water fish, and wildlife, thereby causing many native species to decline in number or go locally extinct. Such modifications can lead to largescale changes in adjacent and downstream ecosystems. Despite these disturbances, some people support continued grazing. Thes...|$|R

Research is needed in understanding the contribution of concentrated, lateral subsurface flow to streambank failure and the hydraulic properties controlling seepage erosion. Laboratory experiments were conducted with two-dimensional soil lysimeters to observe subsurface flow induced erosion of bank faces under controlled conditions. Experiments were performed with single-layer sediment and also layered profiles to mimic <b>streambanks</b> where seepage <b>erosion</b> has been observed. The lysimeter experiments were compared to in-situ measurements of seepage discharge and erosion at field sites in Northern Mississippi. The soil and hydraulic conditions controlling seepage erosion were investigated. Changes in soil water pressure were monitored and modeled using a two-dimensional variably-saturated flow code to deduce information regarding soil water pressures {{at the time of}} bank failure and tension crack formation.

40|$|The Spring Creek Watershed Partnership (SCWP) {{was created}} due to growing {{concerns}} of long time residents in Miller County about the ever increasing degradation of Spring Creek. Invitations {{to participate in}} the partnership were extended to the other five counties {{that are part of the}} Spring Creek watershed. All six counties, along with federal, state, and local agencies, signed the agreement forming the partnership in October 2003. The purpose of the partnership is to provide leadership and promote wise stewardship through community development, educational outreach, and the active participation of private landowners, for enhancing, restoring, and protecting the Spring Creek Watershed. The partnership is in the process of taking inventory of impacts to Spring Creek such as unpaved road sediment input, agricultural land erosion and run off, <b>streambank</b> failure from <b>erosion,</b> channel instability, live stock access, agricultural irrigation, and pathogens that could or have had negative impacts to aquatic fauna.

Brooks. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 87 pages, appendices A-C. The hydrology of the Blue Earth River Basin has been dramatically altered following European {{settlement in the}} mid-to-late 1800 's. Land use change has resulted in hydrologic instability leading to <b>streambank</b> and bluff <b>erosion</b> and increased sediment transport (Magner et al., 2003). Hydrologic change {{has led to an}} increase in Turbidity, or cloudiness of the river commonly measured as total suspended sediment (TSS). Excessive turbidity in water can be harmful to both humans (if used for drinking water) and aquatic life. In the Greater Blue Earth River Basin, there are 39 stream/river reaches that fail to meet the state's water quality standards for Turbidity, which is 90 parts per million TSS (MPCA, 2005). The {{purpose of this study is}} to create a tool that researchers can use to prioritize stream restoration in the Blue Earth River Basin in a relatively quick, productive and cost-effective way. The tool created will help prioritize stream sites for restoration based on a set of decision support metrics. A field test of the tool was conducted on two tributaries to the Blue Earth; Elm and Center Creek. The tool was tested on a total of 30 sites from these two tributaries.

40|$|This is {{the second}} of a report series about {{designing}} a market based instrument to address water quality issues in the Fitzroy Basin, Central Queensland. There are significant exports of sediment and nutrients from the Fitzroy River each year, with potential impacts on waterways, the estuary, and the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. The bulk of those exports come from non-point sources, principally agricultural land used for grazing, farming and irrigation purposes. Key mechanisms to reduce those exports are to protect riparian areas and to improve ground cover in grazing and farming areas. The focus of this report is the protection of riparian areas and buffer zones as the key strategy to achieve improved water quality outcomes. The key ecological benefits of this strategy would come from three main sources: reduced nutrients directly associated with livestock in riparian areas, reduction in <b>streambank</b> and gully <b>erosion,</b> and increased trapping of sediments and nutrients from overland flows. The extent of ecological benefits from riparian vegetation will vary from site to site, and modelling tools such as Sednet {{may be useful to}} predict such outcomes. The opportunity costs of establishing riparian strips fall into two main categories; capital costs (fencing and water) and recurrent costs (production loss and management effort). There are substantial variations according to industry, enterprise and location. When opportunity costs are assessed for different ecological outcomes, the variations will be cumulative, meaning that there will be large variations in opportunity costs to achieve water quality improvements, even between enterprises in the same industry and catchment. Evidence about the benefits of improved water quality in the Fitzroy Basin has been assessed from a number of choice modelling studies that have been performed. The results of those studies show significant values for attributes such as waterway health and estuary health, where water quality {{is likely to be a}} key contributor to attribute levels. By association, there are high levels of community value for improving water quality in the Fitzroy Basin. Regulation is one possible approach to improving water quality through better provision of riparian strips. The regulatory approach has been increasingly used since the 1990 s to protect remnant vegetation in the catchment. However, it is much more difficult to use regulatory tools to set management actions. Devolved grants and market based instruments offer more flexible means of achieving these outcomes...|$|R

During June 19 th to 20 th, 2012, northeastern Minnesota experienced a high record rainfall event, causing soil saturation and inundation, slope failures, flash flooding, and damage to public infrastructures. Geomorphic {{effects of the}} flood included severe <b>streambank</b> and bluff <b>erosion</b> and landslides. The {{purposes of this study}} are to investigate erosional hotspots and channel reaches in Duluth-area streams that experienced significant geomorphic changes {{as a result of the}} 2012 flood and to determine the roles of human modifications to the stream networks on erosional hotspots at a reach scale. 	Erosion occurred when driving forces, controlled by topography and precipitation, overcame resisting forces, controlled by shear strength of materials at the bed and banks. One-meter resolution lidar data, which were collected before and after the flood, were used to extract driving forces, predict erosional hotspots, and map out locations of significant geomorphic change in a GIS framework. Lidar data were first filtered in GeoNet to remove noise in low-gradient areas and enhance geomorphic features. The lidar-derived DEMs were then used to calculate a stream power-based erosion index (SP) and angle of impingement (AOI), to identify stream reaches with high bend curvature, and to identify stream reaches proximal to high bluffs. Bedrock exposure locations, which could significantly limit erodibility, were obtained from Minnesota Geological Survey maps (Hobbs, 2009 a, b, c). These parameters were used to predict preliminary erosional hotspot locations. Field observations were done to verify the results of predicted erosional hotspots from the GIS-based predictive model and develop a new threshold model. The refined predicted erosional hotspots were classified into different types and were compared with valley types and channel-reach types to determine how susceptible different channel-reach types were to change. 	The preliminary GIS-based predictive model had low accuracy of prediction due to misidentification of many erosional sites along the streams, compared to erosional sites from field observations. The refined threshold model improved the percent of accuracy for all points and for FEI >= 2 to greater than 80 %, with less than 10 % of points over- and under-predicted on three sample streams. The Minnesota Geological Survey (MGS) bedrock exposure maps were verified and improved by field maps, resulting in 90 - 95 % accuracy in new bedrock exposure locations. In terms of types of erosional hotspots, more than 70 % of erosional hotspots in the northern and the southern ends of Duluth are located in pool-riffle reaches within entrenched valleys; these hotspots are primarily classified as topographic erosional hotspots, which likely had significant geomorphic changes due to topography, substrate materials, and planform geometry. In the central area of Duluth, more than 70 % of erosional hotspots are located in pool-riffle reaches within confined valleys; these hotspots are classified as topographic/anthropogenic erosional hotspots due to being located in the areas of significant anthropogenic influences. Pool-riffle reaches are identified as the most susceptible channel-reach type to change from the 2012 flood. The GIS-based predictive model could locate erosional hotspots and susceptible reaches which were strongly affected by the 2012 flood. It also incorporates anthropogenic effects to describe the influences of human construction causing erosion in a particular area. The project offers the City of Duluth useful data on causes of the channel changes in the particular reaches, potentially helping with future stream restoration efforts...|$|R
