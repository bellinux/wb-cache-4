5|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of <b>species</b> <b>in</b> Narcissus have varied widely, from {{anywhere}} between 16 and almost 160, even in the modern era. Linnaeus originally included six <b>species</b> <b>in</b> 1753, by 1784 there were fourteen by 1819 sixteen, and by 1831 Adrian Haworth had described 150 species.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{about the number}} of <b>species</b> <b>in</b> the genus Attalea (broadly defined). In 1965, Dutch taxonomist Jan Gerard Wessels Boer estimated that there may be as many as 100 <b>species</b> <b>in</b> the genus. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas Andrew Henderson and coauthors recognised 29 <b>species</b> <b>in</b> the genus, while Sidney Glassman recognised 65 <b>species</b> <b>in</b> his 1999 treatment of the group. Largely following Glassman's lead, Rafaël Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised 67 <b>species</b> <b>in</b> their 2005 World Checklist of Palms. An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species more narrowly than Henderson. As a result, what Henderson interpreted as variation within species, Glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species. This problem is {{complicated by the fact that}} many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections. The large size of the leaves, inflorescences and fruit of many Attalea species makes them difficult to collect. In addition, many important collections, including type specimen, have been lost or destroyed. Sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species.|$|E

5|$|Nycticebus bengalensis, {{commonly}} known as the Bengal slow loris or northern slow loris, is a strepsirrhine primate in the slow loris genus, Nycticebus.

30|$|The {{frequency}} of occurrence of a particular species was calculated {{as the percentage of}} samples <b>in</b> which the <b>species</b> occurs. <b>In</b> this way, all the recorded species were classified within four distinct groups, according to Foissner et al.
