40|$|The Dual-Axis Radiography for Hydrodynamic Testing (DARHT) {{facility}} at Los Alamos {{was developed for}} flash radiography of large hydrodynamic experiments. Both axes now routinely produce radiographic source spot sizes having full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) less than 1 mm. The beam canonical angular momentum contributes to spot size, and it is minimized by using a <b>shielded</b> <b>source</b> of electrons. An ideal <b>shielded</b> <b>source</b> creates the beam {{in a region where}} the axial magnetic field is zero, thus the canonical momentum is also zero, since the beam is born with no mechanical angular momentum. It then follows from Busch's theorem that the canonical angular momentum is minimized at the target, at least in principal. In the DARHT accelerators, the axial magnetic field at the cathode is minimized by using a solenoid with reverse polarity to cancel out whatever solenoidal beam transport field exists there. This is imperfect in practice, because of radial variation of the total field across the cathode surface, solenoid misalignments, and long-term variability of solenoid fields for given currents. This article quantifies the relative importance of canonical momentum in determining the focal spot, and establishes a systematic methodology for tuning the bucking coils for minimum spot size...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the past}} decade a {{significant}} shortage of ³He has occurred. Since this material is widely used in neutron detection applications, e. g. by first responders, during on-site inspections, and in safeguard applications where nuclear and radioactive material has to be localized and possibly identified, replacement materials need to be considered, selected, implemented in a corresponding detector, and thoroughly tested. One of these promising materials is ⁶Li which is utilized in detector applications such as ⁶LiF/ZnS, CLYC (Cs₂LiYCl₆:Ce), and CLLB (Cs₂LiLaBr₆:Ce). The latter two detector types even offer the possibility of measuring gamma radiation simultaneously with good discrimination capability between neutrons and gammas. Within the detection materials neutrons are captured by ⁶Li, triggering the nuclear reaction ⁶Li(n,t) α. The secondary particles then create light pulses in the scintillation crystal which ultimately serve as detection signals. Due to the large Q-value of the reaction of 4. 78 MeV, the signals are of the same order of magnitude as those of high energetic gamma photons. The discrimination of neutron and gamma radiation can be realized by pulse shape analysis. Measurements with all detector types mentioned above have been performed. We have verified these detectors’ capabilities with measurements of several neutron sources, also compared to a detector filled with ³He. The possibility of detecting such a (hidden and/or <b>shielded)</b> <b>source</b> which creates a radiation field only slightly above the background radiation level is of particular interest.

A unit μCi source activity was equivalent to an exposure to the substrate of 18 β-particles/cm 2 in this case. The presence of cells and medium in a Petri-dish was found to sig- nificantly increase (up to a maximum of 250 %) the measured number of photons in a narrow band of wavelengths of 340 ± 5 nm (i. e. UVA) as compared to the signal from an empty control Petri-dish. When coloured growth medium was added to the cells, it reduced the measured count rate, while the addition of transparent medium in equal volume increased the count rate, compared to cells alone. We attribute this to the fact that emission, scattering and absorption of light by cells and media are all variables in the experiment. Under collimated irradiation conditions, it was observed that increasing cell density in medium of fixed volume resulted in a decrease in the observed light output. This followed a roughly exponential decline. We suggest that {{this may be due to}} increased scattering at the cell boundary and absorption of the UV in the cells. We conclude that we have measured UVA emitted by cells, cell medium and cell substrates as a consequence of their irradiation by low LET β-particle radiation. We suggest that these secondary UV photons could lead to effects in non-targetted cells. Some effects that had previously been attributed to a chemically mediated “bystander effect” may in fact be due to secondary UV emission. Some radiation bystander effect studies may require re-interpretation as this phenomenon of UV emission is further investigated...|$|E

In contrast to the previous publications, in the current paper the mechanism of active shielding solution based on the difference potential theory is analysed.

The correspondence between the finite-difference solution and the continuous solution based on Green's function is shown for the case of a uniform medium. Different possible representations of the active <b>shielding</b> <b>source</b> terms are analysed.
