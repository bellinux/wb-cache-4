40|$|Abstract. A <b>smooth</b> <b>end</b> of a Bryant {{surface is}} a conformally {{immersed}} punctured disc of mean curvature 1 in hyperbolic space that extends smoothly through the ideal boundary. The Bryant {{representation of a}} <b>smooth</b> <b>end</b> is well defined on the punctured disc and has a pole at the puncture. The Willmore energy of compact Bryant surfaces with <b>smooth</b> <b>ends</b> is quantized. It equals 4 π times the total pole order of its Bryant representation. The possible Willmore energies of Bryant spheres with <b>smooth</b> <b>ends</b> are 4 π(N ∗ 2, 3, 5, 7). Bryant spheres with <b>smooth</b> <b>ends</b> are examples of soliton spheres, a class of rational conformal immersions of the sphere which also includes Willmore spheres in the conformal 3 –sphere S 3. We give explicit examples of Bryant spheres with an arbitrary number of <b>smooth</b> <b>ends.</b> We conclude the paper by showing that Bryant’s quartic differential Q vanishes identically for a compact surface in S 3 {{if and only if}} it is the compactification of either a complete finite total curvature Euclidean minimal surface with planar ends or a compact Bryant surface with <b>smooth</b> <b>ends.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanical}} behaviour of cohesive soil at relatively high stresses {{with a particular}} emphasis on the significance of specimen end restraint on the interpretation of triaxial test results. Undrained triaxial shear tests have been performed on specimens K 0 consolidated to stresses ranging from 0. 6 to 10 MPa. Behaviour is examined at three well-defined OCRs of 1, 2 and 4 in compression mode of shear. The tests were performed on Resedimented Boston Blue Clay (RBBC), a low plasticity illitic clay resedimented in the laboratory from natural Boston Blue Clay. The triaxial test results demonstrate a significant and consistent decrease in normalized undrained strength, initial stiffness and friction angle with increasing stress level at each OCR. These trends are observed regardless of specimen end condition and {{are consistent with the}} results of previous studies performed on RBBC as well as on other resedimented clays. Previous investigations which have examined behaviour at high stresses through a program of laboratory triaxial testing have all involved the use of fixed ends in the triaxial device, i. e. the ends of the specimen are restrained from radial deformation by rough porous stones. Problems associated with specimen end restraint can be minimized by using <b>smooth</b> <b>end</b> platens in the triaxial device. The impact of end restraint has been examined by comparing the results of triaxial tests performed using <b>smooth</b> <b>ends</b> with corresponding results obtained using conventional fixed ends. When shearing is carried out at a relatively slow rate, the use of fixed ends has been shown to result in a small but consistent underestimation of undrained strength at each OCR tested. In addition, the use of fixed ends results in the measurement of misleadingly high pore pressures during undrained shearing, even when shearing is performed at a slow rate and pore pressure equalization is allowed to occur throughout a specimen. Slip surfaces were not found to develop during shearing for tests performed with <b>smooth</b> <b>ends,</b> although they do occur if fixed ends are used. The occurrence of a slip surface in resedimented clay is believed to be caused by the boundary conditions of the test. by Brendan Casey. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{excellent}} insulation {{properties of}} compressed Sulphur Hexaflouride are {{adversely affected by}} metallic particle contamination in practical gas insulated systems. The movement of such particles is random and the particles {{play a crucial role}} in determining the insulation behavior of GIS. A Three-phase enclosure-type gas insulated bus (GIB) has widely been applied to minimize the installation space of a substation. To determine the particle trajectories in a three-phase common enclosure Gas Insulated Bus duct (GIB) an outer enclosure of diameter 500 mm and inner conductors of diameters 64 mm spaced equilaterally are considered. Aluminum, copper and silver particles were considered to be present on enclosure surface. In order to determine the random behavior of moving particles, the calculation of movement in axial and radial directions was carried at every time step using rectangular random numbers. Simulation of Particle Movement with Reduced Phase Conductor is also carried out with a view to obtain optimum size of conductor for reliable operation by reducing the original diameter of the conductor from 64 mm to 54 mm in steps of 5 mm. At each reduced diameter the particle movement is calculated at each instant in both radial and axial directions using Monte Carlo Technique. Monte Carlo simulation is also carried out by changing the random solid angle from 1 degree to 0. 5 degrees. The random solid angle is decreased to 0. 5 degrees to take into account more <b>smooth</b> <b>end</b> profile of the particle. It is observed that a lower solid angle random movement yields a lower axial movement. It therefore suggests that a more <b>smooth</b> <b>ended</b> wire wil...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the techno-functional study of a tool with a <b>smooth</b> <b>end,</b> typologically classifiable as spatula, made from a red deer {{metatarsal}} recovered at the early Mesolithic rock-shelter GalgenbÃ¼hel/Dos de la Forca. The site {{is located in the}} middle Adige Valley at Salurn/Salorno (South Tyrol â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Northern Italy) and was dwelled by Sauveterrian hunter-gatherer-fisher-communities from the mid- 9 th to the mid- 8 th millennium cal. BC. Subsistence was based on the exploitation of wetland and valley bottom resources including an intense and at times specialized fishing activity. The identification of a probable harpoon fragment among the few but well preserved bone and antler artefacts detected at the site could in fact be part of fishing equipment. The main goal {{of this study was to}} recognize the specific use of the tool with a <b>smooth</b> <b>end</b> by means of use-wear analysis. It is quite difficult, indeed, to establish a specific function for this kind of tools as their morphological characters make them suitable for various tasks. A dedicated experimental program was developed to this scope, which involved manufacture and use of spatula replicas for different activities: fish scaling, beading fish heads, working tanned skin, net making, sewing reeds and working birch bark. The implementation of the experimental activity was also aimed at testing tool functionality in the course of the various tasks. The comparison between archaeological and experimental use-wear seems to indicate that the bone tool from GalgenbÃ¼hel was used as a needle for working vegetal material. On the other hand our experiments revealed a high functionality of this kind of tool also in beading fish heads, working tanned hide and bending birch bark...|$|R
