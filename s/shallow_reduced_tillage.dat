One {{objective of the}} TILMAN-ORG Project is to improve weed management with <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> ± cover crops without reducing weed community diversity. This paper reports results obtained in 2012 in 13 long-, mid-, and short-term trials scattered across Europe including winter cereals, maize, grain pea, potato, sunflower and grass/clover or legume leys. Long- and mid- term experiments showed higher weed abundance under <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> but usually without reduced crop yield. Short-term trials showed that <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> system may be troublesome to manage right after the conversion from ploughing, due to higher abundance of weeds and volunteer crops and reduced yield. Interestingly, there was no overall consistent relationship between weed diversity, always higher under <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage,</b> and crop yield...|$|R

40|$|<b>Reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> is an {{increasingly}} popular farming method {{in many parts}} of the world. In some countries it is used on 50 % of the total arable area, but in Denmark the area with <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> is only 10 %. The benefit from <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> is less labour use and lower machinery costs per ha, but there are also environmental benefits as e. g. reduced phosphorus losses and CO 2 emissions. The economic results calculated are based on the DOP II farm economic model, covering arable farms on clay soil. The conclusion is that <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> increases profits by 67 € per ha and there is also a reduction in the use of fuel and in the nitrogen surplus. When no increase in use of pesticide is allowed, the increase in profit from <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> is still 65 € per ha as the change towards spring crops in the reduced till system in itself reduces the pesticide use. <b>Reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> is expected to increase in Denmark, however, experience shows that it might not be a successful strategy for all farmers...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the degrees of weed density and the role of weed control methods in the total production costs of two different cotton farming methods, namely conventional and <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage.</b> In each method, four different cotton sowing norms were applied.

40|$|The minimum {{possible}} soil tillage is {{an important}} part of a sustainable crop production system. Research and practice of <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> was originally started mainly to reduce energy and time consumption related to tillage. However, current research and practice of <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> is also aimed at soil and water conservation as well as reduction of nutrient losses from arable land. Research on <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> in Sweden has been conducted for more than two decades. <b>Reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> comprises different tillage systems, which replace the traditional moldboard ploughing. These also include modem plough shares by which depth of ploughing can be reduced to about 10 cm. This report summarizes investigations of soil physical properties in six long-term experiments with <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage.</b> The experiments were 6 to 24 years old at the time of investigation (in 1997 or 1998). In this study, soil physical properties after minimum tillage and conventional ploughing were compared. Soil physical properties investigated include dry bulk density, soil water content during the vegetation period, infiltration, saturated hydraulic conductivity, water holding capacity, air permeability in the field and laboratory, oxygen content of soil air after continuous or heavy rain, and soil temperature. Soil water content during the vegetation period was measured with TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry). The dry bulk density in the lower part of the top soil was greater in plots with <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> than in plots with conventional ploughing. Many of the investigated soil physical properties were improved by <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage.</b> Variation of soil water content was smaller for <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> than for conventional ploughing. This shows that drainage and water holding capacity often were improved, particularly in the heavy soils. crop yield in heavy clays has been improved by <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage.</b> In some cases, A decrease in yield was observed during the initial periods of <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage,</b> but the difference has been minimized with time, which can be attributed to the improvement of soil structure. This improvement, however, may be less pronounced in light soils. A well planned transition from conventional ploughing to <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage,</b> such as loosening of old plough pan and minimizing of infestation by perennial weeds, can minimize yield losses...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{sustainable}} agricultural systems, which for example enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) content, {{has increased the}} interest for management with <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage.</b> In this study we used a Swedish long-term (20 yrs.) systems experiment, including <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> (harrowing 10 cm) and plowing (moldboard plow 0 – 20 cm) combined with three levels of nitrogen (N) fertilization. With this setup we tested if (1) the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) concentration and (2) the fungi to bacteria (F:B) ratio would be higher under <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> than under conventional tillage, and if this {{would be associated with}} higher SOC concentrations. We also tested if (3) the microbial biomass C close to the surface would be higher under <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> than conventional tillage. Furthermore, since disturbance can reduce respiration and microbial growth we tested if (4) this occurred in our <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> system. In addition, we tested if (5) fertilization increased the growth rate of fungi and decreased that of bacteria. We collected soil samples in July and October and found that the microbial biomass C, measured in October only, was higher close to the surface in the <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> treatment and so was the microbial respiration. The fungal and bacterial growth rate, on the other hand, were not affected by tillage treatment. Fertilization did not affect the bacterial growth rate but did {{have a positive effect on}} fungal growth rate. In accordance with our expectations <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> had a stimulating effect on AMF and saprotrophic fungi, and contrary to our expectation, also bacteria were positively affected by <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage.</b> In line with the unchanged F:B ratio, we found no indication that even 20 years of <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> increased SOC concentrations in the long term...|$|R
40|$|<b>Reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> {{and green}} manures may be capable to further improve organic crop {{production}} systems. However, it is presumed that under organic farming conditions a lower intensity of soil <b>tillage</b> may <b>reduce</b> nitrogen (N) availability and increase weed pressure. A combination of <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> with an appropriate green manure species could answer these problems. The results of a repeated one year trial on the research farm of University of Kassel, regarding the effects of three different green manure species (Sinapis alba, Trifolium resupinatum and Vicia sativa) and conventional (plough) vs. <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> (2012 chisel, 2013 disc harrow) on N availability in spring and on the yield of main crop oat are the topic of this paper. In both years, in the <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> systems the V. sativa treatments resulted in N levels as well as oat yields on a similar level like the best plough treatments. Yield differences between the different green manure treatments in the plough system were generally low.

We report the results from a field experiment comparing the <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> with respect to the conventional tillage in the long-term, in terms of crop production and weed flora, with special attention provided to perennials and grasses, which are more difficult to control. The experiment commenced in 2002 in Switzerland and data on yield, cover, richness and composition of the weed flora were collected for wheat (2003 and 2009), sunflower (2004 and 2010) and spelt (2005 and 2011) through two complete rotations. We found that weed abundance was 2. 3 times higher under <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage,</b> but we did not observe an increasing tendency over the years.

Therefore, a major drawback for organic farmers is that the lack of herbicide and soil inversion could increase weed infestation. Here, we compared <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> and conventional tillage in a 2002 – 2011 field experiment under organic management in Switzerland. We analyzed crop production and weed flora, with a focus on perennials and grasses.

40|$|Organic {{farmers are}} {{interested}} in soil conservation by <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage,</b> techniques well known in conventional agriculture to protect soil quality and limit labor time and energy costs. However, organic farming and <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> can modify weeds, soil structure, and thus soil nitrogen (N) mineralization which strongly influences wheat yield and quality. The main objectives {{of this study were}} to analyze how <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> applied to organic wheat influenced (1) grain yield, protein concentration, and weed infestation; (2) deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination on grain; (3) technological quality parameters such as dry gluten, zeleny index, falling number, and gluten index; (4) protein composition (F 1, F 2, F 3, F 4, and F 5 fractions, and UPP, gliadin/glutenin ratio); and (5) baking test. For this purpose, we analyzed five site-years of data from winter wheat crops where mouldboard ploughing and <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> were compared in three experimental trials (two in France and one in Switzerland). Main results concern wheat yields: the effect of <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> on wheat yield was influenced by several factors such as weed competition. No significant increase in mycotoxin content (DON) due to <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> was detected. Contamination with DON was always below the European threshold for human consumption. The technological quality parameters were less affected by the tillage treatments than grain yield: protein content, gluten index, zeleny index, and falling number showed on average no significant difference between treatments although the protein composition was slightly different. The main results of this study are that the effect of <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> on grain yield depends very much on soil type, weather conditions, and time after conversion, whereas there is only minor impact on wheat quality. This is in contrast to the hypothesis that <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> under organic farming will cause problems in baking quality...|$|R
40|$|No-tillage and <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> are {{considered}} sustainable options of conservation tillage. While US organic farming researchers {{have focused on}} no-tillage, European organic farming researchers have concentrated on <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> through the reduction of tillage depth or the application of noninversion tillage practices. Combinations of these two approaches have been implemented {{by the use of}} the two-layer plow or the layer cultivator. These innovations often came from farmers, aiming at reducing off-farm inputs such as fuel, and saving costs and labor, {{while at the same time}} building up soil fertility. Systematic, documented research on <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> systems in Europe started only 1 - 2 decades ago, with experiments in Germany, Switzerland and France. While most experiments mimic stockless farms, other experiments include fodder crops such as grass-clover ley and applications of manure and slurry as is typical for mixed farms with animals and crops. Soil organic carbon, microbial activity and soil structure are often improved in the upper soil layer under <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> compared with plowed soils. However, these positive findings were confounded by lower yields in some cases and enhanced weed pressure, except for the two-layer plow. Often it was not possible to determine whether and to what extent yield reduction was due to weed competition or to nitrogen shortage, because of retarded nitrogen mineralization in spring in <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> systems. In systems with manure use, also higher soil fertility measures concomitant with increased yields were reported under <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage.</b> Indeed, it is difficult to gain an overview on research activities dealing with <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> in organic farming in Europe due to dispersed experimental infrastructures and the scarcity of peer-reviewed published literature.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{promotion of}} conservation agriculture (CA) in regions with weathered soils prone to phosphorus (P) deficiency merits explicit consideration of {{its effect on}} P availability. A long-term CA field trial located on an acid, weathered soil in western Kenya was evaluated for effects of <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> and residue retention on P availability. <b>Reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> and residues were hypothesized to increase soil aggregation, and as a result, reduce P sorption potential, increase labile and organic P (Po), and stimulate phosphatase activities. After 9 years (18 cropping seasons), residue management {{had no effect on}} soil aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD), soil P fractions, or phosphatase potential activities. However, <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> increased soil MWD and labile soil P stocks at 0 – 15 cm depth. Total P was greater at 0 – 15 cm depth under <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage,</b> but not for 0 – 30 cm depth, indicating stratification of P under <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage.</b> Increases in total P at 0 – 15 cm depth were correlated with maximum P sorption (Pmax sorption), whereas labile P increased with MWD and Po stocks. <b>Reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> also decreased pH and increased Pmax sorption, but these properties were not correlated. Despite a positive association of MWD and Po, weak or no changes were observed for Po and phosphatase activities, nor were there management effects on soil C stocks. Low residue retention rates (2 t maize residue yr− 1) and relatively small improvements in soil structure due to <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> were likely insufficient to yield changes in Po. Fertilizer P inputs at recommended rates (60 kg P ha− 1 per season) may have also muted treatment effects on organic P cycling, though phosphatase activities were positively correlated with inorganic P fractions. The <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> component of CA offers some improvements in P availability in weathered soils of western Kenya. However, relatively low soil available P across treatments suggests that CA with P fertilization may not be an optimal P management strategy for weathered soils in this region...|$|R

Increased tillage depth did not affect the penetration resistance in the non-ploughed plots. The ploughed plots generally had lower penetration resistance than the non ploughed plots and the shallow ploughed plot resulted in higher penetration resistance compared to the deep ploughed plots. On Charlottenlund root development was significantly higher in the non-ploughed plots which {{is interesting}} compared to other studies that have found higher root development in ploughed plots. Infiltration in the top soil was generally higher in the ploughed plots. At the depth of the plough pan the infiltration was higher in non-ploughed plots at Väby but no differences were found at Charlottenlund. The dye tracer experiment showed that there were no differences between ploughed and non-ploughed plots. The four different tillage methods did not significantly affect crop yields on Charlottenlund and Väby in 200...|$|R
40|$|Conservation <b>tillage</b> (no-till and <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage)</b> {{brings many}} {{benefits}} {{with respect to}} soil fertility and energy use, {{but it also has}} drawbacks regarding the need for synthetic fertilizers and herbicides. Our objective was to adapt <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> to organic farming by quantifying effects of tillage (plough versus chisel), fertilization (slurry versus manure compost) and biodynamic preparations (with versus without) on soil fertility indicators and crop yield. The experiment was initiated in 2002 on a Stagnic Eutric Cambisol (45 % clay content) near Frick (Switzerland) where the average annual precipitation is 1000 mm. This report focuses on the conversion period and examines changes as <b>tillage</b> intensity was <b>reduced.</b> Soil samples were taken from the 0 - 10 cm and 10 - 20 cm depths and analysed for soil organic carbon (Corg), microbial biomass (Cmic), dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and earthworm density and biomass. Among the components tested, only tillage had any influence on these soil fertility indicators. Corg in the 0 - 10 cm soil layer increased by 7. 4 % (1. 5 g Corg kg- 1 soil, p < 0. 001) with <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> between 2002 and 2005, but remained constant with conventional tillage. Similarly, Cmic was 28 % higher and DHA 27 % (p < 0. 001) higher with reduced than with conventional tillage in the soil layer 0 - 10 cm. In the 10 - 20 cm layer, {{there were no significant differences}} for these soil parameters between the tillage treatments. Tillage had no significant effect on total earthworm density and biomass. The abundance of endogeic, horizontally burrowing adult earthworms was 70 % higher under <b>reduced</b> than conventional <b>tillage</b> but their biomass was 53 % lower with <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage.</b> Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and spelt (Triticum spelta L.) yield decreased by 14 % (p < 0. 001) and 8 % (p < 0. 05), respectively, with <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage,</b> but sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) yield was slightly higher with <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage.</b> Slurry fertilization enhanced wheat yield by 5 % (p < 0. 001) compared to compost fertilization. Overall, Corg, Cmic, and DHA improved and yields showed only a small reduction with <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> under organic management, but long-term effects such as weed competition remain unknown...|$|R

40|$|<b>Reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> systems {{potentially}} {{provide both}} {{environmental and economic}} benefits. However, {{the system is not}} universally applicable and requires a higher standard of overall management than ploughing, the conventional form of tillage, particularly with respect to maintenance of yield and soil structure, straw and stubble treatment, grass weed and slug control. As such <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> systems are non-prescriptive and require new ways of learning compared to more simple conventional techniques. This article examines the technical and social dimensions of such learning through a study of farmers practicing <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> in England. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were carried out with 12 farmers implementing <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> and four promoters associated with an initiative supporting them. The results show that a community of <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> farmers, motivated by different interests, has been emerging in England. Individual farmers are learning at the farm level through experimentation and adaptation, and have used a variety of networking devices to take this learning and validate and reflect on it by interacting with others with the same experiences. The networks were also found to extend to researchers and some agronomists. Thus the individual activity of on-farm learning, the technical dimension, is accompanied and enhanced by a process of social learning, the social dimension. However, there are barriers to this social learning, which themselves are intimately connected with the technical complexities of the system. The results show that not all farmers are willing to share their experiences. The difficult nature of <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage,</b> and the high management standards needed to implement it well, has made some farmers reluctant to engage in networks due to fear of criticism from other farmers, desire to protect their new found knowledge from competitors, or poor regard for the standards of farmers new to the system...|$|R
40|$|A b s t r a c t. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the ef-fects of traditional, reduced and no-tillage systems on the soil physi-cal properties: bulk density, water content, stability in water and soil physical quality. Traditional tillage involved soil inversion whereas <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> and no-tillage were non-inversion systems. Soil phy-sical properties were measured on samples collected from the field throughout the growing season and harvest times. These included: particle size distribution, soil water content and bulk density. Soil sta-bility was measured in terms of the content of readily-dispersible clay (RDC) in the soil samples. From water retention curves, an in-dex of soil physical quality (S index) was calculated. The effect of tillage systems on the values of the physical properties was signi-ficant. The non-inversion plots (<b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> and no-tillage) in-creased water content and bulk density in the top layer in compari-son with traditional <b>tillage.</b> <b>Reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> and no-tillage <b>reduced</b> the amount of RDC and therefore increased soil stability, especial-ly in the top layer in comparison with traditional <b>tillage.</b> <b>Reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> and no-tillage also decreased the S index after the first year in comparison with traditional tillage. However, after 4 years, the non-inversion plots (<b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> and no- tillage) showed some improvementin soil physical quality and soil stability in water.

40|$|Maize (Zea mays) {{cultivation}} for silage has {{negative impacts}} on {{soil and water}} quality: reduced soil organic matter, nitrate leaching, soil-biota decline, etc. These problems can be caused partly by intensive soil tillage, like ploughing. The suitability of less-intensive tillage alternatives for farmers, in terms of effects on yield and soil quality, is unknown. On three field experiments, two on sandy soils and one on marine clay soil, we compared ‘full-field inversion tillage’ with two <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> systems: ‘full-field non-inversion tillage’ and ‘strip-cutter’. <b>Reducing</b> <b>tillage</b> intensity in silage maize cropping influenced both yields and soil quality: at two locations yields tended to be reduced, and at two locations soil organic matter content was lower in inversion <b>tillage</b> compared to <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage.</b> The possible implications of reduced soil organic matter mineralisation for nitrogen dynamics are discusse...|$|R

The number of perennial weeds were monitored in a comparison of two potato cultivation systems: conventional ploughing and hilling versus <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> with dead mulch. In 2014, perennial weeds in the mulch system increased to double the number compared to the ploughed system. The reverse pattern was observed in 2015.
