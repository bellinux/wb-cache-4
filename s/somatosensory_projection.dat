40|$|Somatosensory {{input to}} the {{hypothalamus}} has been thought to ascend via an indirect, multisynaptic pathway. However, we have antidromically identified nociceptive spinal cord neurons that project {{directly to the}} lateral hypothalamus in rats. Retrograde tracers injected into the lateral hypothalamus labeled many spinal neurons bilaterally within the marginal zone, the lateral reticulated area, the lateral spinal nucleus, and the area surrounding the central canal. An anterograde tracer injected into these areas of the spinal cord labeled fibers and terminals in the lateral hypothalamus and, surprisingly, {{in a number of}} telencephalic areas. These findings demonstrate a direct <b>somatosensory</b> <b>projection</b> from the spinal cord to the hypothalamus and several telencephalit regions.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} claustrocortical connections labeled with the fluorescent retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold (FG) was conducted on 90 rabbits subdivided into the following age groups (P 2, P 7, P 14, P 21, P 30, P 60, P 90, P 120, P 180). The equal volumes of retrograde fluorescent tracer FluoroGold (FG) were injected into the selected regions of the motor or somatosensory cortices. The volume of the dorsal part of the claustrum, total number of pro-jecting neurons, numerical density and percentage distribution of projecting neurons were estimated {{by means of the}} unbiased stereological methods. The claustrocortical connections both with the motor and somatosensory areas in a rabbit are established in the postnatal life. The parts of the claustrum occupied by the motor and <b>somatosensory</b> <b>projection</b> zones as well as the morphology of the cortically projecting neurons do not reveal characteristic changes during the studied period. The significant decrease of the total number and numerical den-sity of cortically projecting neurons as well as the increase of the claustral vol-ume may reflect the process of adjustment of the claustrum to its modulatory function upon corresponding cortical areas. The intensity of the claustral con-nections with the motor and somatosensory cortices reveals significant differ-ence during the studied period, being higher for the motor projection. It may be assumed that the claustrocortical connections established before birth undergo significant quantitative changes during postnatal development. key words: claustrum, claustrocortical connections, rabbit, retrograde transport, fluorescent tracers, stereolog...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{electrophysiological}} and anatomical study {{identified the}} sensory inputs to the "flank" of the mouse's superior colliculus, a large, ventrolateral extension of layer IV (stratum griseum intermediate) {{that has no}} overlying visual layers (II and III). Electrophysiological recordings with subsequent histological localization showed that the flank receives predominantly <b>somatosensory</b> <b>projections</b> from the perioral region but not visual input. In its caudal parts, the flank also has limb and trunk somatosensory inputs and auditory inputs. The perioral <b>somatosensory</b> <b>projections</b> to the flank are ordered somatotopically. The flank is {{considered part of the}} superior colliculus since the perioral inputs are adjacent to inputs from mystacial vibrissae in the more medial parts of the superior colliculus, hence forming a single continuous map. The finding that no visual responses occur above the flank (due to the absence of superficial layers) or within it is in accord with the concept of an intermodality "spatial register". Since flank neurons have somatosensory receptive fields in non-visible parts of the body and they lack visual responses, the flank may be involved more in tactile-dependent rather than in vision-dependent orienting behaviors. Thus, the superior colliculus may, in parallel, carry out sensorimotor transformations related to (1) shift of gaze and (2) tactile-dependent behaviors not involving vision...|$|R

40|$|While multisensory {{integration}} {{is thought to}} occur in higher hierarchical cortical areas, recent studies in man and monkey have revealed plurisensory modulations of activity in areas previously thought to be unimodal. To determine the cortical network involved in multisensory interactions, we performed multiple injections of different retrograde tracers in unimodal auditory (core), somatosensory (1 / 3 b) and visual (V 2 and MT) cortical areas of the marmoset. We found three types of heteromodal connections linking unimodal sensory areas. Visuo-somatosensory projections were observed originating from visual areas [probably the ventral and dorsal fundus of the superior temporal area (FSTv and FSTd), and middle temporal crescent (MTc) ] toward areas 1 / 3 b. <b>Somatosensory</b> <b>projections</b> to the auditory cortex were present from S 2 and the anterior bank of the lateral sulcus. Finally, a visuo-auditory projection arises from an area anterior to the superior temporal sulcus (STS) toward the auditory core. Injections in different sensory regions allow us to define the frontal convexity and the temporal opercular caudal cortex as putative polysensory areas. A quantitative analysis of the laminar distribution of projecting neurons showed that heteromodal connections could be either feedback or feedforward.

40|$|Background: Slow-adapting type I (SA-I) afferents deliver sensory {{signals to}} the {{somatosensory}} cortex during low-frequency (or static) mechanical stimulation. It {{has been reported that}} the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>projection</b> from SA-I afferents is effective and reliable for object grasping and manipulation. Despite a large number of neuroimaging studies on cortical activation responding to tactile stimuli mediated by SA-I afferents, how sensory information of such tactile stimuli flows over the somatosensory cortex remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated tactile information processing of pressure stimuli between the primary (SI) and secondary (SII) somatosensory cortices by measuring effective connectivity using dynamic causal modeling (DCM). We applied pressure stimuli for 3 s to the right index fingertip of healthy participants and acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data using a 3 T MRI system. Results: DCM analysis revealed intra-hemispheric effective connectivity between the contralateral SI (cSI) and SII (cSII) characterized by both parallel (signal inputs to both cSI and cSII) and serial (signal transmission from cSI to cSII) pathways during pressure stimulation. DCM analysis also revealed inter-hemispheric effective connectivity among cSI, cSII, and the ipsilateral SII (iSII) characterized by serial (from cSI to cSII) and SII-level (from cSII to iSII) pathways during pressure stimulation. Conclusions: Our results support a hierarchical somatosensory network that underlies processing of low-frequency tactile information. The network consists of parallel inputs to both cSI and cSII (intra-hemispheric), followed by serial pathways from cSI to cSII (intra-hemispheric) and from cSII to iSII (inter-hemispheric). Importantly, our results suggest that both serial and parallel processing take place in tactile information processing of static mechanical stimuli as well as highlighting the contribution of callosal transfer to bilateral neuronal interactions in SII. open 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A {{distinctive}} {{property of}} SII {{is that it}} is the first cortical stage of the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>projection</b> pathway that integrates information arising {{from both sides of the}} body. However, there is very little known about how inputs across the body mid-line are processed within SII. Results Optical intrinsic signal imaging was used to evaluate the response of primary somatosensory cortex (SI and SII in the same hemisphere) to 25 Hz sinusoidal vertical skin displacement stimulation ("skin flutter") applied contralaterally, ipsilaterally, and bilaterally to the central pads of the forepaws. A localized increase in absorbance in both SI and SII was evoked by both contralateral and bilateral flutter stimulation. Ipsilateral flutter stimulation evoked a localized increase in absorbance in SII, but not in SI. The SII region that responded with an increase in absorbance to ipsilateral stimulation was posterior to the region in which absorbance increased maximally in response to stimulation of the contralateral central pad. Additionally, in the posterior SII region that responded maximally to ipsilateral stimulation of the central pad, bilateral central pad stimulation approximated a linear summation of the SII responses to independent stimulation of the contralateral and ipsilateral central pads. Conversely, in anterior SII (the region that responded maximally to contralateral stimulation), bilateral stimulation was consistently less than the response evoked from the contralateral central pad. Conclusions The results indicate that two regions located at neighboring, but distinctly different A-P levels of the anterior ectosylvian gyrus process input from opposite sides of the body midline in very different ways. The results suggest that the SII cortex, in the cat, can be subdivided into at least two functionally distinct regions and that these functionally distinct regions demonstrate a laterality preference within SII. </p...|$|E

Experimental data corroborates the choice of model parameter settings.

40|$|The sensory {{information}} flow at subcortical relay stations {{is controlled by}} the action of topographic connections from the neocortex. To determinate the functional properties of the <b>somatosensory</b> corticofugal <b>projections</b> to the principal (Pr 5) and caudal spinal (Sp 5 C) trigeminal nuclei, we performed unitary recordings in anesthetized rats. To examine the effect of these cortical projections we used tactile stimulation of the whisker and electrical stimulation of somatosensory cortices. Corticofugal anatomical projections to Pr 5 and Sp 5 C nuclei were detected by using retrograde fluorescent tracers. Neurons projecting exclusively to Pr 5 were located in the cingulate cortex while neurons projecting to both Sp 5 C and Pr 5 nuclei were located in the somatosensory and insular cortices (> 75 % of neurons). Physiological results indicated that primary somatosensory cortex produced a short-lasting facilitating or inhibiting effects (< 5 minutes) of tactile responses in Pr 5 nucleus through activation of NMDA glutamatergic or GABAA receptors since effects were blocked by iontophoretically application of APV and bicuculline, respectively. In contrast, stimulation of secondary somatosensory cortex did not affect most of the Pr 5 neurons; however both cortices inhibited the nociceptive responses in the Sp 5 C nucleus through activation of glycinergic or GABAA receptors because effects were blocked by iontophoretically application of strychnine and bicuculline, respectively. These and anatomical results demonstrated that the somatosensory cortices projects to Pr 5 nucleus to modulate tactile responses by excitatory and inhibitory actions, while projections to the Sp 5 C nucleus control nociceptive sensory transmission by only inhibitory effects. Thus, somatosensory cortices may modulate innocuous and noxious inputs simultaneously, contributing to the perception of specifically tactile or painful sensations...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to determine in the rat the topography of the neostriatal projections originating from the motor cortex. For that purpose, anterograde tracers (Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin: PHA-L; wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase: WGA-HRP) were deposited in discrete cortical sites physiologically identified by microstimulation. Five major motor areas were considered in this study: the rostral (RFL) and caudal (CFL) forelimb areas, the hindlimb (HL) area, the vibrissae motor-frontal eye field (V-FEF) region and the jaw, lips and tongue (JLT) area (according to the nomenclature of Neafsey et al.). The results indicate that functionally {{different regions of the}} motor cortex project to different sectors of the caudate putamen (CPU). All 3 distinct limb areas RFL, CFL and HL project to the dorsolateral quarter of the CPU, V-FEF area projects to the dorsomedial quarter, whereas the JLT area projects to the ventrolateral quarter. The pattern of terminal labeling is relatively consistent, whatever the cortical area in which the tracer is deposited. This pattern is characterized by the presence of two or more labeled bands which are obliquely oriented along a ventrolateral-dorsomedial axis. Control experiments were also undertaken in which a retrograde tracer (WGA-HRP) was deposited in various neostriatal loci. The results are congruent with the findings of the anterograde study and further indicate that a given neostriatal sector receives projections from cytoarchitectonically different but functionally related regions of the neocortex. The somatotopic features of both motor and <b>somatosensory</b> corticostriatal <b>projections</b> appear to be in register. In addition, the striatal distribution of motor cortical fibers was compared in 6 experimental cases to the compartmental subdivision of the striatum in patches and matrix, following immunohistochemical localization of calbindin 28 kDa. The calbindin-immunoreactivity is extremely weak in the dorsolateral sector but is higher in the central and ventrolateral parts of the CPU. In these deep striatal regions receiving fibers from V-FEF, JLT and, to a lesser extent, from the limb areas, the cortical fibers are mostly directed to the matrix. The band-like organization of the projection from the motor cortex is correlated to the patch-matrix organization. The patches correspond to the bands of low density of terminal fibers and the matrix to the bands of high terminal density. The present results provide an anatomical basis to both electrophysiological and behavioral observations suggesting that functional distinctions can be established between subregions of the striatum.

40|$|The precerebellar system {{constitutes}} {{an array of}} nuclei located in the mammalian hindbrain and conveys movement and balance information from the cortex, spinal cord and periphery to the cerebellum (Sotelo, 2004). Within this system, the pontine nuclei (PN), including pontine gray and reticulotegmental nuclei, mostly relay cortical information (Schwarz and Thier, 1999). During the processing through the cortex, PN and cerebellum, continuous maps of sensorimotor information are transformed into a complex fractured map (Leergaard et al., 2006). To date, however, there is a paucity of knowledge on the molecular and cellular mechanisms organizing this complex circuitry. Previous work suggests an intrinsic topographic organization, according to rostro-caudal progenitor origin, that is maintained during migration and nucleation of the PN (Di Meglio et al., 2013). As a result, one {{of the hallmarks of}} the PN topography is a well-defined population of Hox paralogous group 5 (PG 5) expressing neurons in the posterior part of the PN. However, the molecular mechanisms governing the spatial expression pattern of Hox PG 5 genes in the PN and their functional impact on circuit formation remain largely unknown. The first part of this thesis focuses on the molecular mechanisms of Hox PG 5 induction in the precerebellar system. We find that the precise spatio-temporal expression pattern of Hox PG 5 genes rely on the integration of environmental signaling and the resulting modifications of the epigenetic landscape. Unlike transcripts of more anterior Hox genes, expression of Hox PG 5 genes is entirely excluded from progenitors in the rhombic lip (RL) and only induced in a subset of postmitotic neurons. Mapping and manipulation of signaling pathways show that the restriction of Hox PG 5 induction to the ventrally located (i. e. posterior RL-derived) postmitotic pontine neuron subsets is due to an interplay between retinoic acid (RA) and Wnt environmental signaling. Assessment of histone profiles at Hox loci indicate that the induction of Hox PG 5 genes through RA is tightly linked to a depletion of the histone mark H 3 K 27 me 3. However, conditional inactivation of Ezh 2, a member of the polycomb repressive complex 2 responsible for setting the H 3 K 27 me 3 mark (Margueron and Reinberg, 2011), does not result in a de-repression of Hox PG 5 genes in the progenitor domain. In contrast, removal of H 3 K 27 me 3 in Ezh 2 depleted PN neurons leads to an ectopic induction of Hox PG 5 in rostral PN neuron subsets of the migratory stream showing an enhanced response to RA (Di Meglio et al., 2013). Moreover, high levels of RA-induced Hox PG 5 expression in postmitotic PN neurons require Jmjd 3, one of the enzymes known to catalyze the removal of methyl groups at H 3 K 27 (Agger et al., 2007; De Santa et al., 2007). We show that Jmjd 3 is physically present at RA responsive elements in proximity to the Hoxa 5 promoter supporting the direct involvement of Jmjd 3 in Hox PG 5 induction. Thus, a central function of H 3 K 27 me 3 regulation during late stages of precerebellar development is the establishment of a threshold for RA mediated activation of Hox PG 5 genes to allow for diversification of PN neurons. Finally, we show how the integration of environmental signaling on the epigenetic level results in distinct changes of the three dimensional (3 D) organization of chromatin at Hox PG 5 loci in vivo. Together, the late specification of PN neurons employs a sophisticated sequence of interactions between signaling pathways such as RA and Wnt, and histone modifying enzymes like Ezh 2 and Jmjd 3. The second part of the thesis addresses the functional significance of Hox PG 5 genes in sub-circuit formation of PN neurons. Using multiple conditional overexpression strategies, we show that the expression of Hoxa 5 is sufficient to shape the input-output relationship of PN neurons. Hoxa 5 expressing neurons migrate into a posterior position in the PN and induce a distinct transcriptional program specific for topographic circuit formation. Together, this indicates a crucial role of Hoxa 5 in the specification of the positional identity of PN subsets. We further describe a genetically identified Hox PG 5 negative PN subset that primarily projects to the paraflocculus, a lobule in the cerebellum heavily concerned with visually related tasks. Conditional overexpression of Hoxa 5 in this PN subset leads to the ectopic targeting of several other lobes in the cerebellum concerned with processing of somatosensory information. This matches with the input connectivity of the PN that {{has been shown to be}} antero-posteriorly patterned, such that visual/medioposterior projections target the anterior, Hox PG 5 negative, and <b>somatosensory</b> <b>projections</b> target the posterior, Hox PG 5 positive part of the PN (Di Meglio et al., 2013; Leergaard and Bjaalie, 2007). Consequently, Hoxa 5 overexpressing PN neurons are largely devoid of input from the visual cortex and primarily engage in a somatosensory hindlimb specific circuitry. One single Hox gene is thus sufficient to position neurons in the posterior aspects of the PN, change their transcriptional program and rearrange both, output connectivity to the cerebellum and input connectivity from the cortex. These findings extend the function of Hox genes to orchestrating topographic circuit formation in the PN. Further, the presented results point towards an involvement of Hox genes in the longstanding problem of fracturing of the somatosensory map that is realized between the cortex and the cerebellum. ...|$|R
