5000|$|As {{part of the}} Mars Direct plan, Mars {{exploration}} advocate Robert Zubrin {{and other}} baselined an [...] "inline" [...] SDV concept developed by engineers at NASA and Martin Marietta. The rocket consisted of a large upper stage and payload <b>shroud</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on top of the}} Space Shuttle external tank, and the Orbiter replaced by a simple engine pod. The rocket would launch crews and vehicles directly to Mars. The term [...] "Mars Direct" [...] reflected the idea of launching crews and habitats directly to Mars, without assembly or significant loiter in low Earth orbit. NASA's planned Ares V vehicle would superficially resemble this vehicle due to its [...] "inline" [...] setup, although the Mars Direct Ares used side-mounted Space Shuttle Main Engines and a core with the Shuttle External Tank's diameter for greater commonality with Space Shuttle infrastructure.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{performed}} at Volvo Cars, some concepts of modelling cooling fans with Computational Fluid Dynamics are evaluated {{by comparison with}} experimental data. Focus is set on the method Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) but the Body Force and Mixing Plane Models are also investigated. All measurements were carried out in Volvo Cars component test rig where pressure jump and air flow rate through a cooling fan and <b>shroud</b> <b>mounted</b> on a heat exchanger were measured. In order to make relevant comparisons, a detailed numerical model of the test rig with fan, shroud and heat exchanger were created. A mesh with high node density, in total 14 million tetrahedral elements, was used and the simulations were carried out with the standard k-å turbulence model. The comparisons were performed for different air flow rates, rotational speeds, cooling packages, and for setups with open and closed speed flaps. The Multiple Reference Frame approach reproduces fan performance with good accuracy for most cases. For these cases measured and computed data differ with less than 3. 5 % air flow rate. Moreover, the MRF approach generates good results for open and closed speed flaps {{as well as for}} idle conditions. It also introduces swirl leading to a realistic prediction of the velocity distribution downstream the fan. The MRF method is well suited when doing flow simulations within the engine room and is therefore recommended to use. Furthermore, improvements concerning the procedure to numerically represent heat exchangers {{and the use of the}} Body Force Model are described. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{prospects of}} using blisks with shrouded blades. Increasing an engine life and efficiency {{as well as}} mass reduction can also be achieved by increasing blade numbers and decreasing disk diameter. But design engineers {{are faced with the}} problem of blade placement because of the disk size and root dimensions. The problem of increasing life and cyclic durability, vibration strength, and lightweight design of the turbine gas turbine wheels, can be solved by an elimination of blade - disk locks. The technology of manufacturing one-piece blisks by connecting the blades with the disc part using hot isostatic pressing was developed. This technology allows us to use blades with shrouds. It is necessary to increase efficiency and to improve high cycle fatigue performance of rotor blades. One of the pressing problems is to ensure the necessary position of shrouds in relation {{to each other in the}} manufacturing process as well as in the service. Numerical studies of the influence of the <b>shroud</b> <b>mounting</b> position on blade strength during operation allowed us to develop a methodology of choosing a <b>shroud</b> <b>mounting</b> position. Based on the two turbine wheels (LPT and HPT) calculations advantages of blisk design with respect to the lock-based design were shown. Application of bimetallic blisks with shrouded blades resulted in a lifespan increase and weight reduction. In addition, other advantages of blisk design are as follows: possible reduction in the number of parts, elimination of leaks and fretting that take place in the blade - disk locks, exception of expensive broaching operations and disk alloy saving. The shortcoming is elimination of damping in root connection. In addition, there are no widely used repair methods. Despite these disadvantages the usage of bimetallic turbine blisks with shrouded blades is very promising. </p...|$|R

40|$|Mistuning of bladed disks in turbo-machinery is {{practically}} unavoidable. Small mistuning {{may result in}} larger vibration amplitudes of single blades than larger mistuning, but sometimes single blade vibration amplitudes may be {{much larger than the}} tuned blade row amplitude, despite the fact that mistuned blade rows average vibration levels are lower. More recently blades with <b>shrouds</b> <b>mounted</b> on the disks with some inter-shroud clearance have become popular, because this arrangement may restrict the maximum blade vibration levels in some cases. This effect, called snubbing mechanism, has been analyzed for perfectly tuned rows. In this paper a first analysis is made with a numerical model of a bladed disk investigating the possible effects of mistuning on snubbing behavior. The model of the bladed disk, in which each blade is represented by a single degree of freedom system with parameters derived from single blade modal analysis, is used for analyzing its dynamical behaviour. Different amounts of randomly distributed mistuning are introduced and their effect on natural frequencies and associated mode shapes are checked. Finally the contact between shrouds is introduced and its effect on the vibrations is calculated for the tuned blade row and for the different mistuned blade rows. The results show to which extent and in which condition snubbing is helpful in reducing stress levels in vibrating blade rows...|$|R
