The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism(s) responsible for laser <b>scabbling.</b> This was achieved in three stages. The first stage was a test series used to establish an experimental procedure for assessing the effects of various parameters that may be critical for the effectiveness of the process, such as material composition and initial moisture content. The second stage was a test series investigating the effect of concrete composition on laser <b>scabbling.</b> The first two test series identified that the driving force of laser <b>scabbling</b> in concretes originates from the mortar, therefore, the third test series concentrated on the factors that influence laser <b>scabbling</b> of mortars. Throughout the study, infra red recordings have been used to quantify laser <b>scabbling</b> behaviour, along with the volume removal due to laser <b>scabbling</b> and characterisation techniques such as XRF, DTA and TGA.

40|$|Laser {{concrete}} <b>scabbling</b> is {{the process}} by which the surface layer of concrete may be removed {{through the use of a}} low power density laser beam. The main aim of this investigation was to establish relationships between laser interaction time and volume removal for a wide range of material compositions, including different w/b ratios, binder compositions (OPC/PFA), aggregate/binder ratios and coarse aggregate sizes. The results show that 25 % replacement of ordinary Portland cement with pulverised fuel ash and/or a reduced water/binder ratio improves the efficiency of <b>scabbling</b> of cement pastes. Mortars and cement pastes were seen to <b>scabble</b> at a constant rate, whereas concretes experienced a peak rate, after which volume removal reduced dramatically. Basalt aggregate concrete was less susceptible to laser <b>scabbling</b> than limestone aggregate concrete. The effects of composition on the mechanisms which drive laser <b>scabbling</b> are discussed.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual (MARSSIM) {{requires}} that Final Status Surveys be performed on materials and surfaces that vary in surface smoothness and/or uniformity. To obtain accurate survey data, {{it may be}} necessary to adjust detector response for these surface variations. NUREG- 1507 refers to such surface efficiency adjustment factors as ε[subscript s], the source efficiency. This parameter is meant to be a detector-independent, yet surface and nuclide-dependent parameter that can be used to adjust observed count rate to provide a true measure of the degree of contamination present. Key measurements in the calculation of (ε[subscript s]) are the energy of the radionuclide contaminant and the average height of the detector above the contaminated surface. During the last year, Oregon State University, Department of Nuclear Engineering and Radiation Health Physics provided technical support for a Final Status Survey of a commercial nuclear plant. OSU NE/RHP has conducted research and experimentation to determine site-specific source efficiency (ε[subscript s]) values for concrete surfaces which had undergone simulated decommissioning activities, such as surface scabbling. Source efficiency (ε[subscript s]) values were determined for seven separate <b>scabbled</b> concrete surfaces which had been prepared using 5 tool types.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} on a reinforced concrete (RC) strengthening technique {{carried out by}} the authors, using surface bonding steel plates (SBSP). To accomplish this investigation, the tension face of one-way spanning RC slabs was <b>scabbled</b> and bonded with one or two sandblasted steel plate(s) of different thicknesses, using epoxy glue. The steel plate thicknesses were varied in order to deter-mine the width-to-thickness ratios that can promote yielding (and not premature debonding) of the RC slabs before failure. A low flexural reinforcement percentage (≈ 0. 314 % bh) was used in order to prevent over-reinforcement and to ensure that failure of the slabs under static loading was due to flexure. Static two-point line loading was adopted to simulate the worse loading condition. Based on the deformation response of the slabs, the most appropriate parameters of the steel plates, for strengthening distressing reinforced concrete slabs were determined. The SBSP strengthening technique was found to possess effective composite proper-ties as all the strengthened RC slabs failed essentially by flexural yielding before steel plate separation, with enhanced load carrying capacity of at least 89 % above that of control slabs...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityThe analysis of the particulate generated by laser material removal processes is important not only from a health aspect but is also useful to understand the underlying process. The mechanisms of particle formation during CO 2 laser cutting of mild steel have been established {{and the influence of}} the laser processing parameters on the particles is discussed. Hydrodynamic instabilities in the melt zone produce airborne particulate during cutting. Larger particulate tend to be formed by shearing of the melt film (50 - 1 OOum) and by pressure gradients (> 1 OOum) within the melt. Additionally the causes of secondary droplet break-up have been addressed. The investigation of these mechanisms enables an enhanced understanding of the cutting process. Investigation of the particle characteristics yields information regarding the health of the laser process. The size distribution of the particulate has been analysed using laser diffraction particle sizing and is shown to relate to the process parameters (cutting velocity, laser power) as well as the product quality parameters (cut surface roughness, kerf width, striation frequency, etc.). Additionally, analysis of the particle morphology using scanning electron microscopy establishes that the particulate generated are often thin-walled hollow spheres. The information provided by the experimental data and the knowledge of the mechanisms of particle formation allows a process control methodology to be applied. In order to implement the system, a particle-sizing instrument has been designed. This instrument is based around a linescan CM OS sensor and is designed to tailor for the needs of an online, real-time control system. The system is entirely optical in nature and works on the principle of laser diffraction. Much of the mathematical processing is done offline enabling it to display size distributions in real-time. Much of the literature, available to date, regarding the solid byproducts of laser cutting use techniques of particle capture and analysis that are not ideal nor informative enough. In order for a realtime particle analysis system to be successfully implemented, the method of capture and the selection of the optimum size band have been thoroughly investigated. Additionally, the particle formation during concrete scabbling was investigated. Concrete was <b>scabbled</b> using a 1 kW C 02 laser and the particles ejected from the surface were investigated for particle size and morphology. Scabbling produces particles which are airborne and hence potential health hazards. The morphology of the airborne particulate showed that the components of the concrete are released from the parent matrix. Some components have particle morphologies that may pose health risks if inhaled (dendritic and needle shaped structures) ...|$|E
40|$|This Closure Report (CR) {{presents}} information {{supporting the}} closure of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 117 : Area 26 Pluto Disassembly Facility, Nevada Test Site, Nevada. This CR complies {{with the requirements of}} the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order that was agreed to by the State of Nevada; U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Management; U. S. Department of Defense; and DOE, Legacy Management. Corrective Action Unit 117 comprises Corrective Action Site (CAS) 26 - 41 - 01, Pluto Disassembly Facility, located in Area 26 of the Nevada Test Site. The purpose of this CR is to provide documentation supporting the completed corrective actions and provide data confirming that the closure objectives for CAU 117 were met. To achieve this, the following actions were performed: • Review the current site conditions, including the concentration and extent of contamination. • Implement any corrective actions necessary to protect human health and the environment. • Properly dispose of corrective action and investigation wastes. • Document Notice of Completion and closure of CAU 117 issued by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. From May 2008 through February 2009, closure activities were performed as set forth in the Streamlined Approach for Environmental Restoration Plan for Corrective Action Unit 117, Area 26 Pluto Disassembly Facility, Nevada Test Site, Nevada. The purpose of the activities as defined during the data quality objectives process were: • Determine whether contaminants of concern (COCs) are present. • If COCs are present, determine their nature and extent, implement appropriate corrective actions, and properly dispose of wastes. Analytes detected during the closure activities were evaluated against final action levels to determine COCs for CAU 117. Assessment of the data generated from closure activities indicated that the final action levels were exceeded for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) reported as total Aroclor and radium- 226. A corrective action was implemented to remove approximately 50 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated soil, approximately 1 cubic foot of radium- 226 contaminated soil (and <b>scabbled</b> asphalt), and a high-efficiency particulate air filter that was determined to meet the criteria of a potential source material (PSM). Electrical and lighting components (i. e., PCB-containing ballasts and capacitors) and other materials (e. g., mercury-containing thermostats and switches, lead plugs and bricks) assumed to be PSM were also removed from Building 2201, as practical, without the need for sampling. Because the COC contamination and PSMs have been removed, clean closure of CAS 26 - 41 - 01 is recommended, and no use restrictions are required to be placed on this CAU. No further action is necessary because no other contaminants of potential concern were found above preliminary action levels. The physical end state for Building 2201 is expected to be eventual demolition to slab. The DOE, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office provides the following recommendations: • Clean closure is the recommended corrective action for CAS 26 - 41 - 01 in CAU 117. • A Notice of Completion to the DOE, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office is requested from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection for closure of CAU 117. • Corrective Action Unit 117 should be moved from Appendix III to Appendix IV of the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order...|$|E

40|$|The Flex {{concrete}} grinder is a lightweight, hand-held {{concrete and}} coating removal system used for decontaminating or stripping concrete surfaces. The US Department of Energy has successfully demonstrated it for decontaminating walls and floors for free release surveys prior to demolition work. The grinder is an electric-powered tool with a vacuum port for dust extraction and a diamond grinding wheel. The grinder {{is suitable for}} flat or slightly curved surfaces and results in a smooth surface, which makes release surveys more reliable. The grinder is lightweight and produces very little vibration, thus reducing worker fatigue. The grinder is more efficient than traditional baseline, tools at removing contamination from concrete surfaces (more than four times faster than hand-held pneumatic <b>scabbling</b> and scaling tools). Grinder consumables (i. e., replacement diamond grinding wheel) are {{more expensive than the}} replacement carbide parts for the scaler and <b>scabbler.</b> However, operating costs are outweighed by the lower purchase price of the grinder (50 % of the price of the baseline scaler and 8 % of the price of the baseline <b>scabbler).</b> Overall, the concrete grinder is an attractive alternative to traditional <b>scabbling</b> and scaling pneumatic tools.

40|$|Abstract: External bonding {{of steel}} plates to {{structural}} concrete members has widely gained popularity in recent years, particularly for repairing and strengthening reinforced concrete beams. The {{success of this}} bonding technique depends {{on the effectiveness of}} the surface preparation of the steel and concrete beams.

In this study, concrete beams with different types of surface preparations were investigated, such as no surface preparation (NSP), wire brushing (WB), <b>scabbling</b> (SC) and hand chipping (HC). The quality of the surface preparation established was measured based on the flexural performance of the externally strengthened steel-concrete beams.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory`s concrete spaller is a hand-held tool {{that can be used for}} decontaminating flat or slightly curved concrete surfaces, obtaining concrete samples, and in-depth removal from cracks in concrete. The concrete spaller includes a 9 -ton hydraulic cylinder and spalling bit. It runs from a hydraulic pump that expands the spaller in pre-drilled holes in the concrete. The result is removal of concrete chunks that fall into the attached metal shroud. The concrete spaller is more efficient than traditional tools such as hand-held pneumatic scabblers and scalers.
