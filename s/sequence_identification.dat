Thus, if an initial stage exists whereby the fragments are differentially present or selected (“enriched”), this approach can be used to quantitatively describe such stage over even a very large number or length of the input sequences, most usually encompassing the entire DNA or RNA of the cell.|$|E

40|$|For DNA barcoding {{to succeed}} as a {{scientific}} endeavor an accurate and expeditious query <b>sequence</b> <b>identification</b> method is needed. Although a global multiple-sequence alignment can be generated for some barcoding markers (e. g. COI, rbcL), not all barcoding markers are as structurally conserved (e. g. matK). Thus, algorithms that depend on global multiple-sequence alignments are not universally applicable. Some <b>sequence</b> <b>identification</b> methods that use local pairwise alignments (e. g. BLAST) are unable to accurately differentiate between highly similar sequences and are not designed to cope with hierarchic phylogenetic relationships or within taxon variability. Here, I present a novel alignment-free <b>sequence</b> <b>identification</b> algorithm [...] BRONX [...] that accounts for observed within taxon variability and hierarchic relationships among taxa. BRONX identifies short variable segments and corresponding invariant flanking regions in reference sequences. These flanking regions are used to score variable regions in the query sequence without {{the production of a}} global multiple-sequence alignment. By incorporating observed within taxon variability into the scoring procedure, misidentifications arising from shared alleles/haplotypes are minimized. An explicit treatment of more inclusive terminals allows for separate identifications to be made for each taxonomic level and/or for user-defined terminals. BRONX performs better than all other methods when there is imperfect overlap between query and reference sequences (e. g. mini-barcode queries against a full-length barcode database). BRONX consistently produced better identifications at the genus-level for all query types...|$|E

Tandem mass {{spectrometry}} {{is a widely}} used method for protein and peptide <b>sequences</b> <b>identification.</b> Since the mass spectra contain up to 80 % of noise and many other inaccuracies, there still exists {{a need for more}} accurate algorithms for mass spectra interpretation. The sizes of protein databases grow rapidly and the methods for indexing these databases in order to interpret mass spectra become very popular. The parametrised Hausdorff distance, suitable for non-metric search, is presented in this paper. It models the similarity among tandem mass spectra very well and it is able to match the spectrum to correct peptide sequence in many cases without any post-processing scoring system...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a package, BioDatabase, a web-based application allowing for genetic <b>sequence</b> <b>identification</b> via {{the creation of}} custom databases. These custom databases contain a relatively small set of genetic data, specific to a species or a subset for a species. Each custom database sequence contains genetic regions with a highly conserved start and end sequence, along with other specific characteristics defined by an administrator. The package addresses issues regarding GenBank, whose information is valuable, yet difficult to properly utilize due to its size and quality. GenBank’s size also prohibits optimal alignment algorithms from being used when identifying sequences against it. BioDatabase integrates this information, allowing optimal alignment algorithms to be run against local data obtained from GenBank or input manually by a researcher. This maximizes application performance with minimal impact on the speed results are returned to researchers. The BioDatabase package allows researchers to formulate <b>sequence</b> <b>identification</b> concepts and test their ideas against a validated database.
