The system is regulated by the department of transport, and many of the foundations Sasakawa later created through grants by The Nippon Foundation were led by previous employees of the department of transport.

[...] Quebec's agricultural sector relies heavily on its fruit and vegetable production. In 1890, a competition began to encourage farmers to improve their farms to achieve the Agricultural Merit Order. County farm improvement contests were begun about 1930 involving over 5,000 farms and their evolution over five years. They have some interests in livestock and mixed farming and dairy as well. From 1947, an artificial insemination and breeding centre has been operating in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec for breeders clubs.|$|E

60|$|Again, Turgot {{removed a}} tax from {{certain forms of}} lease, {{with a view to}} promote the {{substitution}} of a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> for the system of métayers. He abolished an obstructive privilege by which the Hôtel Dieu had the exclusive right of selling meat during Lent. The whole of the old incoherent and vexatious police of the corn-markets was swept away. Finally, he inspired the publication of a short but most important writing, Boncerf's Inconvénients des Droits Féodaux, in which, without criticising the origin of the privileges of the nobles, the author showed how much it would be to the advantage of the lords to accept a commutation of their feudal dues. What was still more exasperating both to nobles and lawyers, was the author's hardy assertion that if the lords refused the offer of their vassals, the king had the power to settle the question for them by his own legislative authority. This was the most important and decisive of the pre-revolutionary tracts.|$|E

Oliver Twist's ninth birthday found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and decidedly small in circumference.

Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate.|$|E

Schwartz and Hans, the two elder brothers, were very ugly men, with {{overhanging}} eyebrows and small, dull eyes which were always half shut, so that you couldn't see into THEM and always fancied they saw very far into YOU. They lived by farming the Treasure Valley, and very good farmers they were. They killed everything that did not pay for its eating. They shot the blackbirds because they pecked the fruit, and killed the hedgehogs lest they should suck the cows; they poisoned the crickets for eating the crumbs in the kitchen, and smothered the cicadas which used to sing all summer in the lime trees. They worked their servants without any wages till they would not work any more, and then quarreled with them and turned them out of doors without paying them. It {{would have been very}} odd if with such a farm and such a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> they hadn't got very rich; and very rich they DID get. They generally contrived to keep their corn by them till it was very dear, and then sell it for twice its value; they had heaps of gold lying about on their floors, yet it was never known that they had given so much as a penny or a crust in charity; they never went to Mass, grumbled perpetually at paying tithes, and were, in a word, of so cruel and grinding a temper as to receive from all those with whom they had any dealings the nickname of the [...] "Black Brothers." ...|$|E

40|$|Soil erosion {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} {{problem in}} western Iowa. While farmers in the area generally {{are aware of the}} erosion problem, relatively few use farm plans which result in the level of conservation needed to stabilize soil loss. Previous studies indicate that economic considerations, particularly, retard adoption <b>of</b> soil-conserving <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming.</b> One problem evidently is that insufficient attention has been devoted to determining erosion-control programs for farmers with different amounts of capital, labor and other resources. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine profitable erosion-control <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> for operators with different amounts of capital and for two different sizes <b>of</b> <b>farms.</b> Emphasis is on profit maximization for the farm as a whole. Since Ida-Monona soils respond readily to fertilization, the plans considered allow an integration of investment in crops, fertilizer and livestock. Specifically, the study is designed to determine the optimum combination of crop rotations, fertilization levels, erosion-control practices and livestock systems. Conservation systems which primarily control erosion either through land cover or mechanical practices are compared by the linear programming technique...|$|R
