40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} a {{geotechnical}} analysis {{of one of the}} settling pits that is used in the Luka Koper seaport, for disposal of dredged material which has accumulated in the course of waterway maintenance and deepening. The <b>settling</b> <b>pit</b> is located on the soft marshy ground of Ankaranska Bonifika next to the Rižana River. It is surrounded by watertight embankments on all sides. In the thesis, there are estimations of the ground properties based on dilatometer and laboratory tests of the underlying soil and in close proximity to the pit. The estimated properties are then used in calculations of the expected ground settlement and overall stability of the structure. The computer program Rocscience Slide is used to calculate the overall stability of the constructed pit. The first calculation evaluates an empty pit while in the second calculation the pit is filled with the consolidated material. The calculations for both stages of the pit reveal that the structure is not safe. An example of an acceptably safe embankment with similar dimensions, built on the same ground is provided. All the calculations estimates in this work are done in accordance with the Eurocode standards...|$|E

Kaseta stoji na mehkih tleh v Ankaranski Bonifiki ob reki Rižani. V nalogi so, na podlagi Evrokod standardov, ocenjene lastnosti tal na podlagi dilatometrskih in laboratorijskih preiskav, izvedenih na območju pod kaseto in v njeni okolici. S pomočjo teh ocen so izračunani pričakovani posedki in globalna stabilnost kasete. Globalna stabilnost je izračunana s programom Rocscience Slide za dve fazi: takoj ko so postavljeni obrobni nasipi in ko je kaseta napolnjena s konsolidiranim materialom. Za obe fazi rezultati kažejo, da objekt globalno ni varen. Na koncu naloge je predlog nasipa podobnih dimenzij, na enakih tleh, ki bi bil sprejemljivo varen. Vsi izračuni v nalogi so narejeni na podlagi Evrokod standardov.

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused to {{characterize}} the ochre precipitates and the mine water effluents of some old mine adits and <b>settling</b> <b>pits</b> after mining of polymetallic ores in Slovakia. It was shown that the mine water effluents from {{two different types of}} deposits (adits; <b>settling</b> <b>pits)</b> have similar composition and represent slightly acidic sulphate water (pH in range 5. 60 - 6. 05, sulphate concentration from 1160 to 1905 g. dm- 3). The ochreous precipitates were characterized by methods of X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and B. E. T. method for measuring the specific surface area and porosity. The dominant phases were ferrihydrite with goethite or goethite with lepidocrocide...|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} {{clay and}} sand mixture forms a white milky liquid called slurry.Slurry {{used to be}} pumped from the pit by a water-wheel and spilled into drags. Water-wheels were used to produce energy and run pumps, although later many in Cornwall were replaced by steam engines. Drags were concrete channels used to settle out Quartz and Mica sands from the clay. Later, clay had to be dried {{for a few days}} in <b>settling</b> <b>pits.</b> When it thickened to the consistency of single cream, the clay was channelled through pipes to settling tanks where it continued to dry for up to 3 months.Lastly, it was spread across the Pan Kiln’s floor made of porous pan tiles that allowed the heat through to finish drying.|$|R

50|$|Meaning: The nibblers {{are being}} herded into a pit {{at the base}} of the volcano, which is spewing some form of {{asphyxiant}} or toxic gas. As the gas (which is denser than air) is blown towards the mice by the currents, it <b>settles</b> into the <b>pit</b> and is breathed in by the nibblers. They start to writhe on the ground in search of clean air, and finally grow still as they are suffocated and die. The mice appear to be napping (according to Boots), which is one of the first clues that leads the quest group to reinterpret this children's song.|$|R
40|$|Infection of non-wounded {{and freshly}} wounded {{detached}} plum fruit by airborne Monilinia laxa conidia on dry, humid and wet plum fruit surfaces, and by conidia and germlings {{that had been}} established on fruits under these wetness regimes, was investigated. Plum fruit (cv. Laetitia) were dusted with dry conidia in a <b>settling</b> tower at <b>pit</b> hardening, 2 weeks before harvest, at harvest and after 28 days cold storage. Non-wounded immature and mature fruit remained mostly asymptomatic, whereas non-wounded cold-stored fruit decayed readily. Wounding drastically increased infection by airborne conidia. Immature fruits were less susceptible to wound infection by airborne conidia than mature fruits. Conidia that were dispersed freshly were more successful in infecting fresh wounds than conidia that were deposited, or germlings that established, on fruits 4 days prior to wounding. This decrease in infectivity was especially pronounced on humid-incubated fruit and on wet-incubated fruit. This study clearly showed {{that in order to}} reduce the incidence of brown rot, inoculum levels on fruit approaching maturity should be reduced by sanitary practices and fungicides. Furthermore, it is essential to protect fruit, especially near-mature fruit, from being wounded. © Australasian Plant Pathology Society 2006. Articl...|$|R
