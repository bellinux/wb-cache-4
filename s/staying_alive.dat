5|$|CGW {{said the}} in-game combat became a {{confusing}} mess once allies became involved, {{in part due}} to poor Artificial Intelligence (AI) that caused them to use powers liberally and become low on blood as a result. The AI was considered to be insufficient for the game; pathfinding failures meant allies would become stuck on environmental objects or each other during combat, use up their costliest abilities on enemies regardless of their threat, and were poor at <b>staying</b> <b>alive</b> in battle. Enemies were similarly dismissed for either not noticing the playable character in obvious circumstances or failing to respond to attacks on themselves.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Rowland officially became {{ambassador}} for MTV's <b>Staying</b> <b>Alive</b> Foundation, {{which aims to}} reduce stigma against people living with HIV and AIDS. She visited projects in Tanzania and Kenya to promote the charity, and underwent an HIV test in Africa {{to raise awareness of}} the disease. In 2009, Rowland connected with Serve.MTV.com, MTV's platform to connect young people with local volunteerism opportunities, for a series of on-air PSAs. From battling homelessness to beautifying impoverished neighborhoods to saving whales, Rowland was joined by the likes of Cameron Diaz, will.i.am, and Sean Kingston as they discuss causes they volunteer to support, and urge young people to join with their friends in making civic service a part of their lifestyle. That same year, she spearheaded a bone marrow drive, and joined fellow singers Alesha Dixon and Pixie Lott to create T-shirts for River Island in aid of the Prince's Trust, profits from which help change young lives.|$|E

25|$|Rincewind was {{the first}} protagonist of Discworld; a wizard with no skill, no wizardly qualifications, and no {{interest}} in heroics. He is the archetypal coward but is constantly thrust into extremely dangerous adventures. In The Last Hero, he flatly states {{that he does not}} wish to join an expedition to explore {{over the edge of the}} Disc—but, being fully geared for the expedition at the time, clarifies by saying that any amount of protesting on his part is futile, as something will eventually occur that will bring him into the expedition anyway. As such, he not only constantly succeeds in <b>staying</b> <b>alive,</b> but also saves Discworld on several occasions, and has an instrumental role in the emergence of life on Roundworld (Science of Discworld).|$|E

25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes <b>staying</b> <b>alive</b> in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E
25|$|In 1996–97, Robson led Boro to both {{domestic}} cup finals but they lost both, losing 1–0 in a replay to Leicester City in the League Cup Final and 2–0 in the FA Cup Final to Chelsea, while they suffered relegation in the Premier League—which {{would have been}} avoided {{if they had not}} been deducted three points in mid-season for cancelling a fixture at late notice. However, at least Boro had the consolation of <b>staying</b> <b>alive</b> in the league up to {{the last day of the}} season. Boro were already bottom of the league at the turn of 1997, but when the points were deducted they found themselves seven points adrift of safety with the 17th placed team having a game in hand. However, results slowly improved over the next few weeks and by the end of March a succession of very good results had seen Boro climb out of the relegation zone. This, coupled with the excellent cup runs, saw Robson voted Premier League Manager of the Month for March 1997. Robson made one playing appearance this season on New Years Day, starting in a 2–0 defeat away to Arsenal. This proved to be his last game as a professional footballer, though it wouldn't be until the following year that he formally announced his retirement.|$|E

500|$|Some {{suggest that}} Meyer is likely a Republican, while others feel {{she is a}} Democrat. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times notes that Meyer's party {{affiliation}} is unknown because the show focuses on bullying and ego rather than ideology. James Poniewozik of Time explains the ambiguity as follows: Veep is [...] "almost all politics and almost no political issues". Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times explains the lack of need for party affiliations, or even political ideology in a similar manner, saying that Veep is [...] "less a show about politics than about politicking." [...] In an interview with The New Yorker Radio Hour, Julia Louis-Dreyfus suggested that Meyer's associated political party is intentionally left unknown to the audience. Louis-Dreyfus later elaborated: [...] " [...] politics are all about her and <b>staying</b> <b>alive</b> ... she will hold any position if it keeps her in office." [...] In the episode Election Night, CNN represents states won by Meyer as blue. In the same episode, she also comments winning the 'blue wall' states of Connecticut and Vermont with [...] "A bowl of hair could win those states".|$|E

Badland explained that Babe [...] "deals with {{things in the}} way that she knows how but it doesn't always work out the way that she wants it to". Badland described Babe's actions as [...] "instinctive", which makes her [...] "often [...] on impulse". She questioned whether Babe could be [...] "an optimist and doesn't fully consider the damage she can cause." [...] Kathy Beale (Taylforth) decides to tip the authorities and after a series of undercover investigations, the police arrest Babe, Mick and Shirley. In her interview, Babe blames Mick and tells the police she was [...] "only acting on instructions". Despite this, they all spend the night in police custody. Badland revealed that Babe [...] "was assuming she could {{find a way out of}} it" [...] when blaming Mick because [...] "it's about <b>staying</b> <b>alive</b> in that moment." [...] She explained that Babe's actions stem from a fear of being arrested and said, [...] "For all she has ever been up to, she has never been in a prison cell so it was about her staying afloat in that precise moment." [...] Badland believed that Babe would be able to [...] "talk her way out of trouble with the Carters" [...] again and explained that [...] "the family have a lot to talk about – and a lot to find out about..." ...|$|E
