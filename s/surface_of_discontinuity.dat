40|$|The {{question}} of electromagnetic surface waves propagating {{along a plane}} of discontinuity between two different media {{was the subject of}} some diversity of opinion. It is related to the equally unsettled question about the merits of the conflicting solutions given by A. Sommerfeld (1) and H. Weyl (2) for the field of an electric dipole oscillating at the surface of a plane earth. A few remarks about this relation will be made in section 5, but its complete discussion will be postponed until a later date, and the present paper will be devoted to the analysis of the independent surface wave. It will be well, therefore, to define what is meant by this term. It is a matter of common knowledge that an ordinary plane wave, falling under an angle on a <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>discontinuity</b> and suffering total reflection in the process, produces in the second medium an inhomogeneous wave with propagation parallel to the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>discontinuity.</b> But this may be called a dependent surface wave because it is only an adjunct of the space waves in the first medium and would not exist without them. On the other hand, an independent surface wave is one which consists of two inhomogeneous waves-one in each medium-running along the dividing surface. Its intensity is appreciable only in a thin layer along the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>discontinuity</b> and decreases exponentially to both sides...|$|E

40|$|A new damage model, {{based on}} {{continuum}} damage mechanics and simulating the opening, closing, and reopening of cracks in concrete using only one <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>discontinuity,</b> is proposed in this article.

Two scalar internal variables have been defined: a tensile damage variable d+d+ and a compressive damage variable d-d-; the threshold of damage is controlled by only one <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>discontinuity</b> and a new parameter controlling the damage variable that should be activated. This new parameter represents the ratio of tensile stress to compressive stress in the damaged material.

However, the discontinuous vector field inherent in the PL models raises some mathematical problems in defining solutions on the <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>discontinuity.</b> To overcome these difficulties we use the approach of Filippov, which extends the vector field to a differential inclusion.

40|$|The {{vanishing}} of the divergence of {{the total}} stress tensor (magnetic plus kinetic) in a neighborhood of an equilibrium plasma containing a toroidal <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>discontinuity</b> gives boundary and jump conditions that strongly constrain allowable continuations of the magnetic field across the surface. The boundary conditions allow the magnetic fields {{on either side of}} the discontinuity surface to be described by surface magnetic potentials, reducing the continuation problem to that of solving a Hamilton [...] Jacobi equation. The characteristics of this equation obey Hamiltonian equations of motion, and a necessary condition for the existence of a continued field across a general toroidal surface is that there exist invariant tori in the phase space of this Hamiltonian system. It is argued from the Birkhoff theorem that existence of such an invariant torus is also, in general, sufficient for continuation to be possible. An important corollary is that the rotational transform of the continued field on a <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>discontinuity</b> must, generically, be irrational.
