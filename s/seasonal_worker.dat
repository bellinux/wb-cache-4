On his return to Japan, Corby {{continued}} to visit him, and they married in June 1998 in Omaezaki, Shizuoka, Japan. While living in Omaezaki, she worked at a Japanese inn.

25|$|Lowe {{was born}} in Black River Falls, Wisconsin on the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin {{reservation}} to Mabel Davis and Martin Lowe. The youngest of six siblings, Truman was thirteen years younger than his sister, Irene. Mabel worked a variety of positions as a cook at the local Mission School and as a laundress. When at home in Black River Falls, Martin was a farmer as well as traveling as a <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker,</b> picking blueberries and cranberries throughout the state. Surrounded often by close family, Winnebago was the language spoken at home. As a child, Lowe attended school at the Black River Indian Mission until grade 6, switching in 1957 to the non-Native school in Black River Falls proper.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand has {{an annual}} quota of 75 Tuvaluans granted work permits under the Pacific Access Category, as {{announced}} in 2001.

Tuvaluans also have access to seasonal employment in the horticulture and viticulture industries in New Zealand under the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Work Policy introduced in 2007 allowing for employment of up to 5,000 workers from Tuvalu and other Pacific islands.

30|$|Overall, <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> in France are, {{under certain}} conditions, {{eligible}} for both unemployment and retirement pensions upon {{the same conditions}} as French nationals.

However, foreign <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> in Germany are often obliged to contribute to the unemployment and retirement scheme without being able to meet the qualifying periods to access these services.

30|$|In France <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> {{are allowed}} to join unions {{as well as to}} change employers. According to the French labour code the {{residence}} permit of <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> was initially dependent on the working contract of the employer (CODETRAS, 2007 : 15).

30|$|Concerning {{unemployment}} benefits Newstart Allowance, the national unemployment scheme for adults, is funded solely by general taxation {{and is available}} to Australian citizens or permanent residents only (Centrelink, 2010). Thus, <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> {{are not eligible for}} {{unemployment benefits}}. However, unemployment benefits are also less relevant for <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> as they are guaranteed a certain number of work hours per week, for a minimum number of months. After the work contract terminates the employer will arrange for the return of the <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> to their home countries. Under these conditions unemployment should consequently not occur during the time period spent in the host country.|$|R

30|$|The four country {{comparison}} {{has thus}} strengthened {{the conclusion of}} this paper that the ‘more rights the better’ does not per se constitute the most suitable approach, as foreign <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> have very specific needs and thus require customised protection. In some cases, as for example in relation to social security, solutions that specifically target the needs of foreign <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> need to be established. However in most other cases the equal treatment doctrine of foreign <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> and nationals of the host country constitutes the most suitable approach in creating appropriate level of social protection rights that best meets the interests of all stakeholders.|$|R

30|$|The {{right to}} {{non-discrimination}} {{relates to the}} fact that <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> are often subject to a different set of rights as they are not nationals of the host country.
