5000|$|The Pentium D brand {{refers to}} two series of desktop dual-core 64-bit x86-64 {{microprocessors}} with the NetBurst microarchitecture, {{which is the}} dual-core variant of Pentium 4 [...] "Prescott" [...] manufactured by Intel. Each CPU comprised two dies, each containing a single core, residing {{next to each other}} on a multi-chip module package. The brand's first processor, codenamed Smithfield, was released by Intel on May 25, 2005. Nine months later, Intel introduced its successor, codenamed Presler, but without offering significant upgrades in design, still resulting in relatively high power consumption. By 2004, the NetBurst processors reached a clock speed barrier at 3.8 GHz due to a thermal (and power) limit exemplified by the Presler's 130 watt thermal design power (a higher TDP requires additional cooling that can be prohibitively noisy or expensive). The future belonged to more energy efficient and slower clocked dual-core CPUs on a single die instead of two. The final <b>shipment</b> <b>date</b> of the dual die Presler chips was August 8, 2008, which marked the end of the Pentium D brand and also the NetBurst microarchitecture.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{a new model}} for <b>shipment</b> <b>date</b> quoting with potential applications in E-commerce. First, a customer sends to the vendor a request for an item advertised at a certain price on the company’s web site. Upon receiving the request, the vendor immediately quotes the customer a no-later-than <b>shipment</b> <b>date</b> for the requested item, {{taking into account the}} amount of time to produce the item and any outstanding order previously placed but not yet fulfilled. If the quoted date is deemed acceptable, the customer subsequently places an order for the item; otherwise, the customer rejects the quote and looks for an alternative vendor (the deal is thus lost). The back-end of the quoting system is a single server production system. We propose heuristics that account for the intricate combinatorics of the server scheduling problem, as well as the uncertainty in customer demand and customer behavior. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This {{research}} aims {{to study}} and improve processes and production lines of erbium doped fibre amplifiers using lean manufacturing systems via an application of computer simulation. It is currently complicated for this process to meet the customers ’ requirement under a present economic climate that products need to be shipped to customers {{as soon as possible}} after purchases ordered. The concepts of lean manufacturing are applied through a computer simulation with three scenarios of lean tooled box systems. Firstly, the production schedule based on <b>shipment</b> <b>date</b> is combined with a first in first out control system. The second scenario focuses on a designed flow process plant layout. Finally, the previous flow process plant layout combined with production schedule based on <b>shipment</b> <b>date</b> including the first in first out control systems. The most preferable scenario from a computer simulation is selected to implement to the real production process of erbium doped fibre amplifiers. A comparison is carried out to determine the actual performance measures via an analysis of variance of the production time per unit achieved via each scenario. The goodness of an adequacy of the linear statistical model via experimental errors or residuals is also performed to check the normality, constant variance and independence of the residuals. The results show that a hybrid scenario of lean manufacturing system with the first in first out control and flow process plant lay out leads to better performance in terms of the mean and variance of production times...|$|E

50|$|Pricing can be {{a manual}} or {{automatic}} process of applying prices to purchase and sales orders, based on factors such as: a fixed amount, quantity break, promotion or sales campaign, specific vendor quote, price prevailing on entry, <b>shipment</b> or invoice <b>date,</b> combination of multiple orders or lines, and many others. Automated systems require more setup and maintenance but may prevent pricing errors. The needs of the consumer can be converted into demand only if the consumer has the willingness and capacity to buy the product. Thus, pricing {{is the most important}} concept in the field of marketing, it is used as a tactical decision in response to comparing market situations.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the sire breed (Corriedale: C; Texel: TX; Hampshire Down: HD; Southdown: SD and Suffolk : SF) on the {{performance}} of 500 C sheep lambing and growth rate, live weight, fat score, hot and cold carcass and tissue thickness in the GR point of heavy lambs was evaluated. Sheep were mated in autumn. From lambing and until <b>shipment</b> <b>date,</b> the animals grazed in a pasture of Trifolium repens, Lotus corniculatus and Festuca arundinacea. Death rate of lambs was low (9 %) and proportion of assisted deliveries was less than 4 %. For both variables the higher values were for the SF mated ewes. The crossbreeding showed comparative advantages over the pure breed concerning born live weight (3, 5; 3, 6; 3, 9; 4, 0 and 3, 4 kg; SD, TX, HD, SF, C, respectively; P<= 0, 01), growth rate (220, 231, 234, 248 and 206 g/day; TX, SD, HD, SF, C, respectively) and finish live weight (33, 4; 34, 7; 35, 2; 37, 3 and 31, 5 kg, TX, SD, HD, SF and C, respectively; P<= 0, 0001), particularly HD and SF rams. SD, HD and SF crossbred animals had a carcass weight superiority varying from 11 to 20 % related to pure Corriedale lambs (16, 4; 16, 9; 17, 8 vs 14, 8 kg, respectively; P<= 0, 0001), TX crossbred animals which was similar to the pure ones (15, 9 vs 14, 8 kg, respectively; P= 0, 16).

40|$|The {{development}} of a multiple supplier tool management system for optimum tool inventory sizing based on reliable delivery forecasting of CBN grinding wheels for nickel base alloy turbine blade fabrication is confronted in this work. The basis for the {{development of}} the system is given by the historical data on tool management consisting of the chronological series of CBN grinding wheel <b>shipment</b> and delivery <b>dates</b> between one manufacturing company (customer) and four external tool manufacturers (suppliers) in a supply network. If historical data are highly variable, stochastic management methods, such as time series analysis, are either inapplicable or responsible for excessive inventory sizing. Alternative approaches are given by special analysis and modelling methodologies, such as those based on fuzzy logic, which deal with deterministic events but are also capable to take into account unpredictable factors for better results in prediction and forecast. In this paper, supplier-dependent dressing cycle time predictions for each external tool manufacturer in the supply network are obtained through a set of multiple-input-single-output adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). The ANFIS predictions can be utilized by the customer to evaluate the supplier reliability in the delivery of CBN grinding wheels, which represents a critical decision parameter in the dressing order allocation procedure and a key reference factor for the implementation of flexible tool management strategies...|$|R
