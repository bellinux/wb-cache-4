40|$|Summary: The formal {{banking system}} plays {{a pivotal role}} in the {{delivery}} of financial services, particularly credit. However, the delivery of credit to poor households in South Africa by the formal banking system is hampered by the existence of irreducible uncertainty. The article analyses a sample of successful practices in different countries to determine the genotype structure in these cases that support specific social technology and the minimalist <b>solidarity</b> group <b>lending</b> method, to transform financial uncertainty that cannot be solved by the market mechanism and even brokerage institutions like banks. Based on the findings, this article recommends that existing social technology can be developed in an environment created and conditioned by a proposed system of constituents or principles, to give the poor access to low-cost credit in South Africa...|$|R

50|$|AMK {{utilizes}} a <b>solidarity</b> group <b>lending</b> methodology {{to administer}} its group loans. This process begins with potential clients self-selecting themselves into solidarity {{groups of four}} to six members. These solidarity groups are then organized into Village Banks that consist of four to twelve groups (or twenty to sixty clients). Being part of a self-selected solidarity group signifies that three to five other villagers trust the loan applicant to let him/her join their group. All loans are guaranteed by the respective group members. Loans are appraised and approved by an AMK Client Officer and the Village Bank President prior to disbursement. Each group nominates a group leader {{who is in charge}} of ensuring member attendance at meetings, troubleshooting, and liaising with the VBP, CO, and other members. AMK also offers several individual loan options to its clients. Generally, these require physical collateral and at least one personal guarantor.|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the social-economic impacts, effectiveness {{and efficiency of}} microcredit given to SGL operators living in Dar- es -Salaam region that are offered loans by the DCB Limited. The study provides empirical primary based information on the social-economic impact of microcredit to the economically active poor (EAP) {{with a range of}} income generating activities and constraints advanced by the clients with a view to alleviating poverty. This evaluation clearly states the problem by which the study is set to address within the community through the DCB microcredit to its clientele base via the SGL methodology. An overview of study findings, reveal that during the three years of operation, the bank recorded efficiency and effectiveness in microcredit provisions and that the clients continue to register their achievement towards the bank services and keep on increasing. Positive impacts of the microcredit benefits have been appreciated through various ways such clients and their families have benefited along with its trickle down effects recorded from time to time. Significant study findings revealed, interalia, the following: - 72 % of the clients are satisfied with the services with majority being the middle aged micro entrepreneurs forming about 61 %. -About 60 % of the clients managed to use part of the credit accruals to fund education for their children. - 87 % have greatly improved and expanded their business opportunities in various dimensions. - 55 % have now, through the bank, coming up and inculcated the culture of saving. -The study further revealed that women empowerment is at the forefront as it records about 66 % of the women who have all the way been encouraged to join and benefit from the scheme. -Apart from the scheme benefiting the targeted population, the bank also created 70 full time bank positions. However, problems observed from the study that the clients do face include: Complaints on high interest rate, high commitment fee, short weekly, repayment and grace periods, small starting loan and lack of proper education on entrepreneurial skills in business management, markets, legal and regulatory framework, licensing and tax issues. This evaluation study suggests ways through which the presented problems could be averted hence provide more microcredit and consequently have greater outreach and sustainability. Some of the problems advanced would need thorough education to clear most of the clients' doubts and simply keep the beneficiaries on the right track. A close observation revealed that the client, group leaders and even bank officers miss important regular training skills in their areas of operation. Proper education is among the suggested ways to mitigate most of the problems gathered from the study. A comprehensive training manual is strongly herewith recommended for implementation, as this is a key and road map towards the workable solution. The set up of this project paper is contained in Five Chapters. -Chapter one is an introduction giving a historical background of the DCB and the S G L clients along with their profiles, the evaluation assignment and its setting. -A detailed literature review and conceptual framework providing theoretical and empirical reviews are given in Chapter Two. -Chapter Three dwells on research methodology detailing sampling techniques, data type, data collection methods, data coding, data management, data analysis and presentation. -Results presentation, observations, findings, discussions, recommendations and conclusions are provided in Chapter Four. -Lastly, Chapter Five is on implementation of the assignment.

50|$|In many {{developing}} countries the legal system offers little, if any support for the property rights of poor people. Laws related to secured transactions - a cornerstone of Western banking - may also be absent or unenforced. Instead, <b>solidarity</b> <b>lending</b> levers various types of social capital like peer pressure, mutual support and a healthy culture of repayment. These characteristics make <b>solidarity</b> <b>lending</b> more useful in rural villages than in urban centres where mobility is greater and social capital is weaker.|$|E

5000|$|Microfinance {{generally}} {{agree that}} women should be {{the primary focus of}} service delivery. Evidence shows that {{they are less likely to}} default on their loans than men. Industry data from 2006 for 704 MFIs reaching 52 million borrowers includes MFIs using the <b>solidarity</b> <b>lending</b> methodology (99.3% female clients) and MFIs using individual lending (51% female clients). The delinquency rate for <b>solidarity</b> <b>lending</b> was 0.9% after 30 days (individual lending—3.1%), while 0.3% of loans were written off (individual lending—0.9%). [...] Because operating margins become tighter the smaller the loans delivered, many MFIs consider the risk of lending to men to be too high. This focus on women is questioned sometimes, however a recent study of microenterpreneurs from Sri Lanka published by the World Bank found that the return on capital for male-owned businesses (half of the sample) averaged 11%, whereas the return for women-owned businesses was 0% or slightly negative.|$|E

The Accion U.S. Network, the US subsidiary of the better-known Accion International, has provided over $450 million in microloans since 1991, with an over 90% repayment rate. One research study of the Grameen model shows that poorer individuals are safer borrowers because they place more value on the relationship with the bank. Even so, efforts to replicate Grameen-style <b>solidarity</b> <b>lending</b> in developed countries have generally not succeeded.

Microcredits have also been introduced in Israel, Russia, Ukraine and other nations where micro-loans help small business entrepreneurs overcome cultural barriers in the mainstream business society. The Israel Free Loan Association (IFLA) has lent more than $100 million {{in the past two decades}} to Israeli citizens of all backgrounds.|$|E

50|$|The Microbanking Bulletin tracks <b>solidarity</b> <b>lending</b> as a {{separate}} microfinance methodology. Of 446 microfinance institutions worldwide that it was tracking {{at the end of}} 2005, 39 lent only through this method, while another 205 used a mix of solidarity and individual lending. The average loan balance outstanding at solidarity lenders was $109 (19% of local gross national income), compared to $1,024 (61% of local gross national income) among individual lenders. This shows not only that solidarity lenders are meeting the needs of a significantly poorer market segment, but also that they are doing it in significantly poorer countries.|$|E
5000|$|NGOs: The Microcredit Summit Campaign counted 3,316 {{of these}} MFIs and NGOs lending to about 133 million clients {{by the end}} of 2006.

They have proven very innovative, pioneering banking techniques like <b>solidarity</b> <b>lending,</b> village banking and mobile banking that have overcome barriers to serving poor populations.

50|$|To {{eliminate}} the need for collateral (the poor man's obstacle to receiving bank loans), village banks rely on a variation of the <b>solidarity</b> <b>lending</b> methodology. It relies on a system of cross-guarantees, where each member of a village bank ensures the loan of every other member. This system gives rise to an atmosphere of social pressure within the village bank, where the cost of social embarrassment motivates bank members to repay their loans in full. The admixture of cross-guarantees and social pressure makes it possible for even the poorest people to receive loans. This method has proven very effective for FINCA, yielding a repayment rate of over 97% in its worldwide network. Village banks are highly democratic, self-managed, grassroots organizations. They elect their own leaders, select their own members, create their own bylaws, do their own bookkeeping, manage all funds, disburse and deposit all funds, resolve loan delinquency problems, and levy their own fines on members who come late, miss meetings, or fall behind in their payments.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Microfinance is the {{provision}} of financial services to low-income clients or <b>solidarity</b> <b>lending</b> groups including consumers and the self-employed, who traditionally lack access to banking and related services. Microfinance helps very poor households meet basic needs and protect against risks. The use of financial services by low-income households is associated with improvements in household economic welfare and enterprise stability or growth. By supporting women's economic participation, microfinance helps to empower women, thus promoting gender-equity and improving household well-being. More than subsidies poor need access to credit. Absence of formal employment make them non `bankable'. This forces them to borrow from local moneylenders at exorbitant interest rates. Many innovative institutional mechanisms have been developed across the world to enhance credit to poor {{even in the absence}} of formal mortgage. Grants can be used to help overcome the social isolation, lack of productive skills, and low self-confidence of the extreme poor, and to prepare them for eventual use of microcredit. Financial sector policies in India have long been driven by the objective of increasing financial inclusion, but the goal of universal inclusion is still a distant dream. For a financial system to be truly inclusive, it should meet the needs of everyone who can fruitfully use financial services, including the poor. For the developing countries like India, microfinance has come as a breakthrough in the philosophy and practices of poverty eradication, economic empowerment and inclusive growth. Yet given the enormity of economic compulsions and complexities in developing countries, microfinance is an unfinishe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{articles}} covers {{performance of}} NABARD and financial inclusive of commercial banking sector. A self-help group (SHG) is a village-based financial intermediary usually composed of 10 – 20 local women or men. A mixed group {{is generally not}} preferred. Most self-help groups are located in India, though SHGs {{can also be found}} in other countries, especially in South Asia and Southeast Asia. Members make small regular savings contributions over a few months until there is enough capital in the group to begin lending. Funds may then be lent back to the members or to others in the village for any purpose. In India, many SHGs are 'linked ' to banks for the delivery of microcredit. Self-Help Group may be registered or unregistered.
