In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Banks revealed that she approached the 30 Rock staff about making an appearance as she is a fan of the show. [...] "I definitely put feelers out, like, 'I would love to be on your show.' And they did it. They made it happen! I'm a huge fan, so this is a dream come true."

500|$|In {{an effort}} to restore {{domestic}} harmony, Cosimo III sent for [...] Madame du Deffand, Marguerite Louise's childhood governess who had tried unsuccessfully to help the Grand Duke before. However, because {{of a string of}} deaths in the Orléans family, the governess arrived with some delay, in December 1672. By then, Marguerite Louise was in the depths of despair, and asked to be allowed visit Villa Poggio a Caiano, a Medici villa, ostensibly for worship at a nearby shrine. Once there, she refused to return, which resulted in a two-year stand off between herself and the Grand Duke, for he would not consent to her return to France, though she begged for this in her parting letter to him. Madame du Deffand's mission having failed, Louis XIV made one final attempt to reconcile the Grand Ducal couple, to no avail. Therefore, all attempts at conciliation having failed, Cosimo capitulated to Marguerite Louise, in a contract signed on 26 December 1674: Marguerite Louise, provided for with a pension of 80,000 livres, was allowed to leave for France, but she had to confine herself to the Abbey of Saint Peter at Montmartre and surrender her rights as a Royal Princess of France. Overjoyed, the Grand Duchess departed for France laden down with the fixtures and furniture of Villa Poggio a Caiano, for, in her own words, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> [...] "of setting forth without her proper wages".|$|E
500|$|It was in {{the video}} of [...] "Material Girl" [...] that Madonna began to accept and utilize herself being {{compared}} to Monroe. However, she established a safe distance from those comparisons and developed inside the same pastiche. Details like the usage of different gloves or different fans in the video brought forth the connections between these women, but Madonna alluded to herself in subtle ways. The fan in Monroe's hand for the original video was an iconography of the Sudarshana Chakra (wheel) held by the Indian idol Vishnu. Scholar Georges-Claude Guilbert, who wrote Madonna as postmodern myth: how one star's self-construction rewrites sex, said that the fan symbolized fiery desire aroused by Monroe as well as ritual sacrifice, eerily foreshadowing her untimely death in 1962. Madonna's fan, which appeared {{at the end of}} the video, signified that Madonna– while paying her tribute to Monroe– was signaling that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of being a victim like her, and that she was on the path of becoming a feminist post-modern myth. Author Nicholas Cook commented that the video promoted Madonna's identity as the song suggested, with the purpose of shifting [...] "Madonna's image from that of a disco-bimbo to authentic star." [...] Lisa A. Lewis, author of Gender, Politics and MTV said that with the video, Madonna achieved the rare distinction of being accepted as a literature medium by the music authors. [...] "Material Girl" [...] was nominated for best female video at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards but lost to Tina Turner's [...] "What's Love Got to Do with It". The video was ranked at position 54 on VH1's 100 Greatest Videos.|$|E

They agreed to it, though, a problem ensued when they could not figure the prompter out, which resulted in Banks [...] "throwing fastballs at [...] and him battling them back as fast as possible and hoping they could cut it together faster than we were doing it." [...] Banks revealed to Ausiello that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> on becoming a series regular, explaining that she has been having [...] "too much fun" [...] making movies to commit to a television show full-time.
