We focused on accurate prediction of the damper bar currents, electromagnetic torque, acceleration time, and bar temperatures during the starting process. We used the time-stepping finite-ele-ment analysis (FEA) for a multiple-pole model including coupled field-circuit formulation and rotor motion. We also developed an analytical model, incorporating the equivalent circuit parameters, to simulate the starting performance of the generator/motor units. The predicted results from both the FEA model and the analytical model agree well with experimental investigations. As a result, we were able to propose a way to improve the motor’s reliability and allow many additional starts.

Under normal operating conditions, the relative position of the rotor axis and the resultant magnetic field axis is fixed. The angle between the two is known as the power angle or torque angle. During any disturbance, the rotor deaccelerates or accelerates with respect to the synchronously rotating air gap mmf, creating relative motion. The equation describing the relative motion is known as the swing equation, which is a non-linear second order differential equation that describes the swing of the rotor of <b>synchronous</b> <b>machine.</b> The power exchange between the mechanical rotor and the electrical grid due to the rotor swing (acceleration and deceleration) is called Inertial response.|$|E

To analyze molecular diversity in its full scope computational models of biological organisms and biochemical pathways are indispensable. Engineering Sciences can be of great help in construction of these models. The central feature of modern engineering has been system level design. The differences between biological systems and engineering systems are notable, particularly at the molecular and device level. However, convergent evolution is thought to yield remarkable similarities at higher levels of organization. Here we compare an electrical engineering system with a biological system. We take the example of <b>synchronous</b> <b>machines</b> and gluconeogenesis. A biochemical system like gluconeogenesis is not just an assembly of enzymes. In addition to the list which catalogs the individual components, it is essential to understand how individual components dynamically interact during such operation.
