The structure then repeats at a lower taxonomic level, with what Cuvier notes is one of Linnaeus's genera, Testudo, the tortoises, with five sub-genera. The first sub-genus comprises the land tortoises; their zoology is summed up in a paragraph, which observes that they have a domed carapace, with a solid bony support (the term being [...] "charpente", commonly used of the structure of wooden beams that support a roof). He records that the legs are thick, with short digits joined for most of their length, five toenails on the forelegs, four on the hind legs.|$|E

If there were no room in the design for the placement and removal of a scaffolding, then the structure might be impossible to build. Few structures of practical interest seem likely to exhibit such a problem, however." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although the Shuowen Jiezi has had incalculable {{value to}} {{scholars}} and was traditionally relied upon {{as the most}} important early source on the structure of Chinese characters, many of its analyses and definitions have been eclipsed as vague or inaccurate since the discovery of oracle bone inscriptions in the late 19th century. It therefore can no longer be relied upon as the single, authoritative source for definitions and graphic derivations. Xu Shen lacked access to oracle bone inscriptions from the Shang dynasty and bronzeware inscriptions from the Shang and Western Zhou dynasty, to which scholars now have access; they are often critical for understanding the structures and origins of logographs. For instance, he put lǜ (慮 [...] "be concerned; consider") under the <b>section</b> <b>heading</b> 思 (sī [...] "think") and noted it had a phonetic of hǔ (虍 [...] "tiger"). However, the early bronze graphs for lǜ (慮) have the xīn (心 [...] "heart") semantic component and a lǚ (呂 [...] "a musical pitch") phonetic, also seen in early forms of lǔ (盧 [...] "vessel; hut") and lǔ (虜 [...] "captive").|$|E
