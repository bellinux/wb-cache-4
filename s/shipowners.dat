5|$|A ship's {{beneficial}} owner is legally and financially {{responsible for the}} ship and its activities. For any {{of a number of}} reasons, some justifiable and some suspicious, <b>shipowners</b> who wish to conceal their ownership may use a number of strategies to achieve that goal.|$|E
5|$|International {{regulations}} for the maritime industry are promulgated by {{agencies of the}} United Nations, particularly the International Maritime Organization and International Labour Organization. Flag states adopt these {{regulations for}} their ships by ratifying individual treaties. One common criticism against flag of convenience countries is that they allow <b>shipowners</b> to avoid these regulations by not ratifying important treaties or by failing to enforce them.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Shipowner’s</b> Lien is a {{possessory lien}} {{which is the}} major {{difference}} between it and other maritime liens. The right to this lien can be applied only on the goods which are delivering by the <b>shipowner</b> when the shipper is the contractual party. It may entitle the <b>shipowner</b> to retain the cargoes as security for the payment of a debt. The contractual <b>shipowner’s</b> lien is currently found in all contracts for carriage of goods by sea nowadays, and may be claimed if the shippers fail to pay the due on time. However, some authorities state {{that there is no}} difference between <b>shipowner’s</b> lien and maritime lien.|$|R
40|$|When a {{maritime}} claim is initiated against a <b>shipowner,</b> the Korean Commercial Code permits the <b>shipowner</b> to limit his liability. However, {{the right to}} limit liability will be denied {{in a case of}} the <b>shipowner's</b> willful misconduct or other reckless act or omission. Proving the facts to support a limitation can be problematic because there are no provisions specified in the Korean Commercial Code. This paper analyzes South Korea's historical position on cases involving the extent of the <b>shipowner's</b> liability and the willful misconduct or other reckless acts or omissions committed by him...|$|R
50|$|A seaman who is {{required}} to sue a <b>shipowner</b> to recover maintenance and cure may also recover his attorneys fees. Vaughan v. Atkinson, 369 U.S. 527 (1962). If a <b>shipowner's</b> breach of its obligation to provide maintenance and cure is willful and wanton, the <b>shipowner</b> {{may be subject to}} punitive damages. See Atlantic Sounding Co. v. Townsend, 557 U.S. 404 (2009)(J. Thomas).|$|R
5|$|The ILO {{successfully}} {{restricted the}} addition of lead to paint, and convinced several countries to adopt an eight-hour work day and forty-eight-hour working week. It also campaigned to end child labour, increase {{the rights of women}} in the workplace, and make <b>shipowners</b> liable for accidents involving seamen. After the demise of the League, the ILO became an agency of the United Nations in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In November 1874, several <b>shipowners</b> were {{contracted}} for {{two years}} from the South Australian government to provide ten round trips between the colonial capital of Adelaide and its furthest outpost, Port Darwin. Port Darwin was feeling {{the effects of a}} gold rush at Pine Creek and growing quickly as a trade post with the Dutch East Indies. However, all the local banks sent their money, together with government paperwork and the Royal Mail, around the east coast to Adelaide. On successful completion of each voyage, the South Australian government would pay the owners £1000 sterling.|$|E
5|$|In the {{north-east}} are two {{homes of}} early wealthy merchants and <b>shipowners</b> connected with Kirkcaldy's harbour. The Merchant’s House or Law’s Close at 339–343 High Street; {{once owned by}} the Law family, {{is one of the}} best surviving examples of a sixteenth-century town house in Scotland. Sailors' Walk, at 443–449 High Street; consists of two seventeenth-century houses, resting on foundations dating back to around 1460. These two houses were once divided into four dwellings; three of which were owned by the Oliphant family and the fourth by James Ferguson of Raith.|$|E
50|$|The {{bill of lading}} {{sometimes}} {{contains a}} clause as to the <b>shipowner's</b> lien. Without any express provision for it, the <b>shipowner</b> has by common law a lien for freight. If it is desired to give the <b>shipowner</b> a lien for demurrage or other charges, it must be expressly provided for. The lien is {{the right of the}} <b>shipowner</b> to retain the goods carried until paid the freight charges, demurrage, or other charge for which a lien has been given. The lien may be waived, and ends with delivery of the goods, or by any dealing with the consignee inconsistent with a right of the <b>shipowner</b> to retain possession of the goods until payment has been made. The <b>shipowner</b> may preserve his lien by landing the goods and retaining them in his own warehouse, or by storing them in a public warehouse, subject to the conditions required by the Merchant Shipping Act (1894).|$|R
50|$|The Article 1 of the 1976 Convention {{increase}} {{coverage of}} entitlement of limitation to <b>shipowner,</b> charterers, managers, operators, slavors, insurer {{of the parties}} and any person for whose act, neglect or default the <b>shipowner</b> or salvor is responsible.|$|R
50|$|Thus, marine cargo is {{generally}} covered twice by insurance standards. The shipper or cargo-owner {{will be covered}} by a marine insurer likely with 'all risks' cover. The carrier or <b>shipowner</b> will {{be covered by the}} P&I club but will typically limit their liability to goods owners to {{a small fraction of the}} retail value of goods. If the cargo is lost or damaged, the cargo-owner needs to first make a claim against the <b>shipowner.</b> However, the <b>shipowner</b> may avoid liability if it did not cause the loss or if the Hague-Visby Rules grant exemption from liability. In that case, the cargo-owner will claim against its own insurance company. If the cargo-owner fails to claim first against the <b>shipowner,</b> but claims instead against its own insurance company, the insurer, having reimbursed its client, will through subrogation pursue the claim in its own right against the <b>shipowner.</b>|$|R
5|$|Long's {{tenure in}} Congress was uneventful, since the Congress was under Democratic Party {{control for the}} six years he served. In {{addition}} to lobbying the administration for patronage appointments, {{he sat on a}} joint committee examining interests of shipbuilding and <b>shipowners,</b> as well as on conference committees dealing with pensions and Navy financing. In 1886 Long married again, to Agnes Pierce, a teacher and daughter of a Universalist minister; they had one son, born in 1887.|$|E
5|$|The {{half century}} {{or so of the}} {{maritime}} fur trade and the North West Coast trade enriched Boston <b>shipowners,</b> creating capital that helped New England's transformation from an agrarian to an industrial society. The trade stimulated the culture of North West Coast natives, made Hawaii famous and nearly overwhelmed the native Hawaiians with foreign influences. It played a role in increased commercial pressure on China at Canton. Fur bearing animals were devastated, especially sea otters. By 1850, sea otters were virtually extinct throughout the North West Coast and found only in the Aleutian Islands and California.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{practice}} of flagging ships {{in foreign countries}} began in the 1920s in the United States when <b>shipowners,</b> frustrated by increased regulations and rising labor costs, began to register their ships to Panama. The use of open registries steadily increased, and in 1968, Liberia grew to surpass the United Kingdom as the world's largest shipping register. , {{more than half of}} the world’s merchant ships were registered with open registries, and the Panama, Liberia, and Marshall Islands flags accounted for almost 40% of the entire world fleet, in terms of deadweight tonnage. In 2006 up to 20% of high-seas fishing vessels were registered in states they were not connected to.|$|E
50|$|In other words, the <b>shipowner</b> has a lien on {{the goods}} carried for the freight payable {{in respect of}} the carriage. On the other hand, the <b>shipowner</b> is obligated to deliver the goods safely, and this {{obligation}} is, by common law, subject to this exception only that the <b>shipowner</b> is not liable for loss or damage caused {{by an act of}} God or the Kings' enemies. The statutes (Merchant Shipping Act 1894, Part Viii.), however, specify that the <b>shipowner</b> is not liable for loss that happens without his actual fault or privity, by fire on board the ship, or by the robbery or embezzlement of—or making away with gold or silver or jewellery of a nature and value not declared in writing at the time of shipment. Further, the <b>shipowner</b> is not liable for damage to or loss of goods or merchandise beyond an aggregate amount that does not exceeding eight pounds per ton for each ton of the ship's tonnage.|$|R

5|$|Flag-of-convenience {{registries}} are criticized, {{mostly by}} trade union organizations based in developed countries, {{especially those of}} Europe. On the other hand, maritime industry practitioners and seafarers from other countries contend {{that this is a}} natural product of globalisation. Seafarers from developed countries must make themselves competitive if they wish to take advantage and practice in a global environment. , thirteen flag states have been found by international shipping organizations to have substandard regulations. A basis for many criticisms is that the flag-of-convenience system allows <b>shipowners</b> to be legally anonymous and difficult to prosecute in civil and criminal actions. Some ships with flags of convenience have been found engaging in crime, offer substandard working conditions, and negatively impact the environment, primarily through illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. , ships of thirteen flags of convenience are targeted for special enforcement by countries that they visit. Supporters of the practice, however, point to economic and regulatory advantages, and increased freedom in choosing employees from an international labor pool.|$|E
5|$|From the start, one of {{the main}} efforts of the Confederate Navy was to counter the {{blockade}} of its ports by the Union Navy. Mallory believed that by attacking the merchant shipping that carried trade to Northern ports he could force his Union counterpart, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, to divert his own small fleet to defend against the raiders. In {{the early days of the}} war, the Confederacy tried to enlist the services of private <b>shipowners</b> in the service by offering letters of marque and reprisal. Issuance of the letters was not in the purview of the Navy Department, but Mallory was aware of them and saw them as part of his plan. For several reasons, the privateers did not have the success that was hoped for. Although they ventured out throughout the war, they had only fleeting success, and that had ceased by the end of the first year.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to being the largest marine–based shipping centre of Greece, Piraeus is also the commercial hub of Greek shipping, with most of Greece's <b>shipowners</b> basing their commercial operations there, largely centred around the street Akti Miaouli. In its capacities as host to Greek shipping, Piraeus has been affected significantly by the various governments of Greece. Following World War II, the Greek government attempted to nationalize the proceeds of the insurance payments given to Greek <b>shipowners</b> who had lost vessels {{as a result of}} those vessels having been commandeered by the Allied Forces; the insurance had been provided by Lloyd's of London and guaranteed by the coalition of the allied forces. Although Greek <b>shipowners</b> ultimately won their case against the Greek government in the British courts, most were uninterested in continuing to base their headquarters in Piraeus, both out of distrust of the Greek government, and because the war had left the greater Athens area in a state of severe poverty. As a result, Greece's <b>shipowners</b> left Piraeus en masse in favour of operations in London, New York, Alexandria and other major shipping cities.|$|E

25|$|In 1970 a {{workgroup}} {{consisting of}} the Finnish Maritime Administration, Wärtsilä Helsinki Shipyard and the association of the Finnish <b>shipowners</b> began working on the new ice class rules in close co-operation with major classification societies. Shortly after the work started the Swedish Maritime Administration joined and the new regulations, published in 1971, {{became known as the}} Finnish-Swedish ice class rules. According to the new rules the requirements for a ship with ice class 1A, deadweight tonnage of 3,500 tons and engine output of 1,500hp were kept largely the same, but the requirements for ships of the lowest ice class, 1C, were increased considerably as in the past such ships had been essentially open-water vessels with a strengthened bow. The minimum requirements for the highest ice class, 1A Super, were lowered to make the ships more attractive to <b>shipowners</b> and the requirements for ships with deadweight tonnage below 3,500 tons were increased in all classes to steer <b>shipowners</b> towards bigger vessels that were deemed better for navigation in ice.|$|E
