50|$|After {{the first}} betting round is complete, another face-up card is dealt to each player (after a burn card, {{starting}} with the player to the dealer's left, as with all subsequent rounds). Betting now begins with the player whose upcards make the best poker hand (since fewer than five cards are face up, this means no straights, flushes, or full houses). On this and subsequent betting rounds, the player to act first may check or bet up to the game's limit. The second betting round {{is followed by a}} third upcard to each player and a third betting round, again {{starting with the}} player with the best poker hand showing (thus, the first player to act on each round may change). A fourth face-up card and fourth betting round is followed by a showdown, if necessary (it usually won't be - most deals of five-card <b>stud</b> <b>end</b> early when a player bets and gets no calls).|$|E
5000|$|With {{respect to}} shape, stud bolts a.k.a studs are {{categorized}} into 3 basic types: [...] "Fully Threaded Stud Bolts", [...] "Tap <b>End</b> <b>Stud</b> Bolts", and [...] "Double <b>End</b> <b>Stud</b> Bolts". Each of these studs have different application. As name suggests, fully threaded studs have full body coverage with threads for full engagement of the matings nuts or similar parts. Tap <b>end</b> <b>studs</b> have threads at extreme {{ends of the}} body with unequal thread engagement length, while double <b>end</b> <b>stud</b> bolts have equal thread length at both ends. Apart from these there are stud bolts for flanges which are fully threaded <b>studs</b> with chamfered <b>ends,</b> and double <b>end</b> <b>studs</b> with reduced shank for special bolting applications.For studs that are not completely threaded, {{there are two types}} of studs: full-bodied studs, and undercut studs. Full-bodied studs have a shank equal to the major diameter of the thread. Undercut studs have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the screw thread. Undercut studs are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied stud the stresses are greater in the threads than in the shank.|$|R
