40|$|Background: <b>Steep</b> {{problems}} {{are common in}} lung cancer survivors, yet {{little is known about}} the prevalence, determinants, and effects on quality of life (QoL) of these <b>steep</b> problems in tong-term Lung cancer survivors. Methods: A case-control study design comparing 76 elderly lung cancer survivors (LCS, > 5 years post diagnosis with mean survival time of 8 years +/- 2. 1 years) and 78 elderly non-cancer controls (NCC). Measurements included a standardized questionnaire for <b>steep</b> (Pittsburgh <b>Steep</b> Quality Index-PSQI), and analogue scales for dyspnea, pain, and other comorbid symptoms, as well as demographic factors and cancer history. Results: Overall, 56. 6 % of LCS had poor <b>steep</b> (PSQI global score > 5) as compared to only 29. 5 % of NCC (p < 0. 001), and 49. 2 % of LCS who did not have <b>steep</b> difficulties prior to their lung cancer diagnosis ultimately developed them. There was also evidence of significant impairments in <b>steep</b> efficiency in LCS (78. 3 %) relative to NCC (89. 6 %, p < 0. 001), predominantly due to increased nocturnal awakenings. A single-item analogue scale for <b>steep</b> quality was not as effective in identifying <b>steep</b> problems as more specific questions about <b>steep</b> duration and <b>steep</b> efficiency. Poor <b>steep</b> quality was significantly correlated with impairments in quality of life, even when controlling for other factors, such as dyspnea. Conclusions: Even 8 years after diagnosis, LCS continue to have significant <b>steep</b> difficulties. By asking specific questions about <b>steep</b> medication use, nocturnal awakenings and <b>steep</b> efficiency, health care providers can identify <b>steep</b> problems that could be treated and potentially improve the quality of life of their patients.

40|$|The {{effective}} hydration {{of barley}} {{is essential for}} the production of malt suitable for use in brewing and distilling. Therefore the focus of this study is on the uptake of water during <b>steeping</b> of barley with a view to shortening <b>steeps</b> and reducing water use. As an additional way of reducing water consumption at malting plants, efforts are being made to find appropriate treatments so that <b>steep</b> water can be recycled. The aim of our research is to minimise the volume of water required for <b>steeping,</b> maximise the potential to recycle <b>steep</b> water and also minimise the length of <b>steeping</b> time. Bryce et al. (2010) showed that when barley was <b>steeped</b> in water continuously for either 8 h or 16 h, hydration of endosperm materials was suboptimal and modification of endosperm materials of barley malt was inadequate. The malt produced under these <b>steeping</b> regimes gave poor friability scores and produced a large number of whole grains. When barley was <b>steeped</b> for 24 h on a continuous basis, or when a regimented standard <b>steeping</b> method was used, the malt produced gave higher friability scores and a much lower number of whole grains. This suggests that a very short <b>steep,</b> essentially a washing of barley, followed by a single <b>steep</b> should be able to produce excellent malt...|$|R
40|$|Previous work having {{shown that}} Bacillus-subtilis-S 499 -based {{biocontrol}} treatments applied without aeration at the <b>steeping</b> stage of red sorghum malting offered good mould reduction but yielded malts with {{low levels of}} key hydrolytic enzymes, we attempted to raise these levels by aerating the <b>steeping</b> liquor, varying the <b>steeping</b> time (from 8 to 40 h) and temperature (from 25 to 35 °C), and combining a biocontrol treatment with prior <b>steeping</b> in 0. 2 % NaOH. Aeration proved particularly important whenever B. subtilis cells were present in the <b>steep</b> liquor. The optimal temperatures for α- and β-amylase were 30 and 25 °C, respectively. By increasing the <b>steeping</b> time it was possible to improve the α-amylase activity, but the -amylase activity peaked sharply between 16 and 20 h, depending on the <b>steeping</b> medium. A good compromise was <b>steeping</b> in biocontrol medium for 14 to 16 h at 30 °C.

5|$|The {{end of the}} Pleistocene ice {{ages and}} the start of the Holocene began to change the area's climate from a cool, wet pluvial one to dryer {{semi-arid}} conditions similar to that of today. With less water to cut, the erosive ability of the Colorado was greatly reduced.

An average of two debris flows per year reach the Colorado River from tributary canyons to form or expand rapids.
