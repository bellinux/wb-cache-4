50|$|Diffusion control {{offers another}} advantage. Changing the {{diffusion}} barrier allows the <b>sensor</b> <b>manufacturer</b> to tailor the sensor {{to a particular}} target gas concentration range. In addition, since the diffusion barrier is primarily mechanical, the calibration of electrochemical sensors {{tends to be more}} stable over time and so electrochemical sensor based instruments require much less maintenance than some other detection technologies. In principle, the sensitivity can be calculated based on the diffusion properties of the gas path into the sensor, though experimental errors in the measurement of the diffusion properties make the calculation less accurate than calibrating with test gas.|$|E

To meet this demand, considerable research into new sensors is underway, including efforts {{to enhance the}} performance of traditional devices, such as resistive metal oxide sensors, through nanoengineering. Metal oxide sensors have been utilized for several decades for low-cost detection of combustible and toxic gases.

Recent advances in nanomaterials provide the opportunity to dramatically increase the response of these materials, as their performance is directly related to exposed surface volume.

40|$|Problem statement: Significant effort {{goes into}} the {{development}} of biomedical software, which is integrated with computers/processors, sensors and electronic instrumentation devoted to a specific application. However, the scientific work on electronic instrumentation controlled by biomedical software has not emphasized software development, instead focusing mainly on electronics engineering. The development team is rarely composed of Software Engineering (SE) experts. Usually, a commercial automated tools environment is not used due to its high cost and complexity for researchers from other areas to understand. Approach: This present study reports how the SE approach was applied to design and develop biomedical software, {{which is part of}} a Computerized Electronic Instrumentation (CEI). This CEI comprises software and an electronic instrumentation based on a force sensor and electrogoniometer to monitor the hand exertion of computer user during typing task. The aim is to serve as a guideline for academic researchers who are not expert in software engineering methodology but usually develop their own software to run with their CEI. The specification of the requirements, presented as use case, includes the context diagram, the data flow diagram, the entity relationship diagram and test procedure. The Unified Modelling Language from the Enterprise Architect tool was used. The developed software and the electronic instrumentation were tested together. Results: A sample of the interface screen shows how the outcomes could be plotted in an integrated manner. By comparing the values with other values obtained by manual calculations and with those provided by <b>sensor</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> the repeatability of test procedure validated the results. Reliable electronic instrumentation when working with unreliable software can become unreliable.

40|$|In {{computer}} world, plug-and-play is a commonplace. In general, {{the sensor}} manufacturers use various standard physical interfaces in their sensors {{but they are}} not compatible in measurement data transfer. IEEE 1451 and ISA- 100 standardization is working on common interfaces for industrial applications. The lack of standards in the field of <b>sensor</b> <b>manufacturer</b> require each sensor to be integrated individually to a wireless sensor node. This thesis presents the design of a sensor integration process for Tampere University of Technology Wireless Sensor Network (TUTWSN). The integration process eases the sensor integration, shortens the required time to integrate a sensor, and minimizes the frequency of errors and the presence of software bugs. The included documentation minimizes the loss of information in multi-partner projects. The integration process consists of five major phases: selecting a sensor, hardware integration testing, integration to a node, integration to a server infrastructure, and testing phases. The focus of this thesis is in the node and its embedded software. The integration process is tested with five sensors which are integrated to TUTWSN. The sensors are: multipurpose standard industrial signal sensor, air velocity sensor, power meter sensor, radon sensor, and piezoelectric motion detector. Two of the sensors are using I 2 C interface, two are using analog-to-digital converter, and one is using interrupts. Multipurpose standard industrial signal sensor required designing and calibrating the whole sensor and new software components on each level. Air velocity sensor needed a fitter sensor board for an existing transmitter and a new software application. Power meter sensor required designed and calibrating the sensor and a new software application. Piezoelectric motion detector required a new sensor and modification to motion detection application. Calibration is in all the cases done with an existing sensor and the designed sensor are calibrated according to it. The sensor integration takes less than two weeks time on average from selecting the sensor to adopted wireless sensor network. /Kir 1...|$|E
40|$|Due to a sharp {{decrease}} in hardware costs and shrinking form factors, networked sensors have become ubiquitous. Today, {{a variety of}} sensors are embedded into smartphones, tablets, and personal wearable devices, and are commonly installed in homes and buildings. Sensors are used to collect data about people in their proximity, referred to as users. The collection of such networked sensors is {{commonly referred to as}} the Internet of Things. Although sensor data enables a wide range of applications from security, to efficiency, to healthcare, this data can be used to reveal unwarranted private information about users. Thus it is imperative to preserve data privacy while providing users {{with a wide variety of}} applications to process their personal data. Unfortunately, most existing systems do not meet these goals. Users are either forced to release their data to third parties, such as application developers, thus giving up data privacy in exchange for using data-driven applications, or are limited to using a fixed set of applications, such as those provided by the <b>sensor</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> To avoid this trade-off, users may chose to host their data and applications on their personal devices, but this requires them to maintain data backups and ensure application performance. What is needed, therefore, is a system that gives users flexibility in their choice of data-driven applications while preserving their data privacy, without burdening users with the need to backup their data and providing computational resources for their applications. We propose a software architecture that leverages a user's personal virtual execution environment (VEE) to host data-driven applications. This dissertation describes key software techniques and mechanisms that are necessary to enable this architecture. First, we provide a proof-of-concept implementation of our proposed architecture and demonstrate a privacy-preserving ecosystem of applications that process users' energy data as a case study. Second, we present a data management system (called Bolt) that provides applications with efficient storage and retrieval of time-series data, and guarantees the confidentiality and integrity of stored data. We then present a methodology to provision large numbers of personal VEEs on a single physical machine, and demonstrate its use with LinuX Containers (LXC).
