Computer Inquiries II established the basic and enhanced service dichotomy, but Computer Inquiries III kept the policy objectives the same while changing how these services were implemented. The Computer Inquiries III {{wanted to make sure}} that the separate <b>subsidiary</b> <b>requirements</b> of Computer Inquiry II did not have additional costs to the public with decreased service and innovation by Bell Operating Companies (BOCS) from using existing regulated operations to benefit from the unregulated enhanced services.The FCC found that the cost of structural separation was more important than not having nonstructural safeguards in place for the Enhanced Service Providers (ESPs) by the BOCs. [...] "These separate structural subsidiaries were not required to be set up by the BOCs if they were moving from a structural safeguard to non-structural safeguard. To set up these safeguards the FCC created two non-structural safeguards called the Comparatively Efficient Interconnection ("CEI") and Open Network Architecture ("ONA").|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} MNC dispersed entrepreneurship based {{on the concept of}} political arena. The model extends previous conceptualizations of MNC dispersed entrepreneurship by explaining how remote employees become stimulated to act as entrepreneurs through resolution of internal political arena within the international management context. We identify variables within this context at corporate, subsidiary, and individual levels as antecedents to political arena in the MNC. These are the corporate immune system, inappropriate control, <b>subsidiary</b> <b>requirements</b> differences and cognitive barriers to knowledge sharing. Different types of internal entrepreneurs (Austrian-like and Schumpeterian-like) emerge {{as a consequence of the}} different ways in which political arena is resolved. We discuss theoretical and managerial implications of the resultant multi-level model. Â© 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Synchronous {{vibration}} in rotor systems having bearings, seals {{or other}} elements with non-linear stiffness characteristics {{is prone to}} amplitude jump when operating close to critical speeds as there may be two or more possible whirl responses for a given unbalance condition. This paper describes research {{on the use of}} active control methods for eliminating this potentially undesirable behavior. A control scheme based on direct feedback of rotor-stator interaction forces is considered. Modelbased conditions for stability of low amplitude whirl, derived using Lyapunov's direct method, are used as a basis for synthesizing controller gains. <b>Subsidiary</b> <b>requirements</b> for existence of a static feedback control law that can achieve stabilization are also explained. An experimental validation is undertaken on a flexible rotor test rig where non-linear rotorstator contact interaction can occur across a small radial clearance in one transverse plane. A single radial active magnetic bearing is used to apply control forces in a separate transverse plane. The experiments confirm the conditions under which static feedback of the measured interaction force can prevent degenerate whirl responses so that the low amplitude contact-free orbit is the only possible steady-state response. The gain synthesis method leads to controllers that are physically realizable and can eliminate amplitude jump over a range of running speeds. Copyright © 2010 by ASME...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a new hierarchical 2 D-guillotine Cutting Stock Problem. In {{contrast to the}} classic cutting stock problem, waste is not an issue. The problem relates to the removal of a defective part and assembly of the remaining parts into homogeneous size blocks. The context is the packing stages of cake manufacturing. The company's primary objective is to minimise total processing time at the subsequent, packing stage. This objective reduces to one of minimising the number of parts produced when cutting the tray load of buns. We offer a closed form optimization approach to this class of problems for certain cases, without recourse to mathematical programming or heuristics. The methodology is demonstrated through {{a case study in}} which the number of parts is reduced by almost a fifth, and the manufacturer's <b>subsidiary</b> <b>requirement</b> to reduce isolated single bun parts and hence customer complaints is also satisfied...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} to develop a comprehensive account of the requirements for voting systems, particularly for public elections. Typically, these approaches identify a number of “high level ” principals which are then refined either into more detailed statements or more formal constructs. Unfortunately, these approaches do not acknowledge the complexity and diversity of the contexts in which voting takes place. This paper takes a different approach by arguing that the only requirement for a voting system {{is that it is}} accurate. More detailed requirements can then be derived from this high level requirement for the particular context in which the system is implemented and deployed. A general, formal high level model for voting systems and their context is proposed. Several related definitions of accuracy for voting systems are then developed, illustrating how the term “accuracy” is in interpreted in different contexts. Finally, a context based requirement for voting system privacy is investigated as an example of deriving a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>requirement</b> from the high level requirement for accuracy. I...|$|R

40|$|Complex, {{end-to-end}} {{network services}} {{are set up}} via the configuration method: each component has {{a finite number of}} configuration parameters each of which is set to a definite value. End-to-end network service requirements can be on connectivity, security, performance and faulttolerance. However, there is a large conceptual gap between end-to-end requirements and detailed component configurations. To bridge this gap, a number of <b>subsidiary</b> <b>requirements</b> are created that constrain, for example, the protocols to be used, and the logical structures and associated policies to be set up at different protocol layers. By performing different types of reasoning with these requirements, different configuration tasks are accomplished. These include configuration synthesis, configuration error diagnosis, configuration error fixing, reconfiguration as requirements or components are added and deleted, and requirement verification. However, such reasoning is currently ad hoc. Network requirements are not even precisely specified hence automation of reasoning is impossible. This is a major reason for the high cost of network management and total cost of ownership. This paper shows how to formalize and automate such reasoning using a new logical system called Alloy. Alloy is based on the concept of model finding. Given a first-order logic formula and a domain of interpretation, Alloy tries to find whether the formula is satisfiable in that domain, i. e., whether it has a model. Alloy is used to build a Requirement Solver that takes as input a set of network components and requirements upon their configurations and determines component configurations satisfying those requirements. This Solver is used in different ways to accomplish the above reasoning tasks. The Solver is illustrated in depth by carrying out a variety of these tasks {{in the context of a}} realistic fault-tolerant virtual private network with remote access. Alloy uses modern satisfiability solvers that solve millions of constraints in millions of variables in seconds. However, poor requirements can easily nullify such speeds. The paper outlines approaches for writing efficient requirements. Finally, it outlines directions for future research...|$|E
40|$|Regulatory {{imputation}} is the {{allotment of}} profits from an unregulated subsidiary to a regulated subsidiary with {{the express purpose}} of reducing the latter's 'revenue requirements'. Here the authors examine the implications of regulatory imputation from the perspective of shareholder risk and return and its effect on the firm's incentives to operate efficiently. Poorly structured imputation rules may fail to provide sufficient incentives for profitable operation of the unregulated subsidiary, resulting in reduced contribution to the regulated <b>subsidiary's</b> revenue <b>requirements.</b> The views expressed herein are solely our own and do not necessarily represent those of the sponsoring organization. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{determine}} how ABB’s treasury department (GTO) should respond to an increasing awareness and interest in the carbon credit markets. Emission caps have been introduced on national levels and also for certain industries in Europe {{as a consequence of}} the Kyoto Protocol. This allows for trading of certain carbon credits as well as for the creation of new credits. ABB is a company which has many solutions for efficient energy use; solutions that aim to reduce electricity cost and in the prolongation also emissions. The awareness of the carbon market is growing within ABB, but no carbon credit generating projects have been completed and the initiatives are scattered. The thesis describes the Kyoto Protocol and its implementation within EU, the markets available for trading by companies as well as what instruments and derivatives exist. With the underlying regulations described an empirical study of ABB’s involvement is conducted. The study shows that ABB has few installations with emissions caps and that the potential for generating new credits as a way to increase profit is quite big. However, there have been no carbon generating projects registered up to this point and there are many barriers to overcome before ABB receives any carbon credits. To ensure a thorough analysis, a model of factors affecting ABB’s carbon credit involvement is formed. The model is based on the available literature on the subjects organizational performance, transfer pricing, project- and financial risk and risk management. GTO’s immediate response should be to set up a pool to which <b>subsidiaries</b> with compliance <b>requirements</b> are to send their carbon credits. The pool will then redistribute the credits so that each subsidiary’s needs are fulfilled and finally settle the net remainder on the open market. A unit independent of GTO, called Group Carbon Operations (GCO) in the thesis, should be formed in the near future with responsibility to actively follow the progress of CDM pilot projects and to facilitate their implementation. Depending on the outcome of these pilot-projects ABB can then either, in case of a negative outcome, quickly end the direct CDM involvement and reach closure or, in case of a positive outcome, further develop the GCO department to profit from ABBs involvement in the CDM market. In case of a positive outcome, the GTO should be further involved regarding risk handling and internal pricing...|$|R
