MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, {{as well as many}} other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{spent nearly}} $380,000,000 million in 2005-06 on research, capping {{a long history}} of productive research. In 1877, botany professor William J. Beal performed the first documented genetic crosses to produce hybrid corn, which led to increased yields. MSU dairy professor G. Malcolm Trout invented the process for the homogenization of milk in the 1930s. In the 1960s, MSU scientists developed cisplatin, a leading cancer fighting drug. Today Michigan State continues its research with facilities such as the U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory and a particle accelerator called the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. In 2004, scientists at the Cyclotron produced and observed a new isotope of the element germanium, called Ge-60. In that same year, Michigan State, in consortium with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the government of Brazil, broke ground on the 4.1-meter Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR) in the Andes Mountains of Chile. The consortium telescope will allow the Physics & Astronomy department to study galaxy formation and origins. Since 1999, MSU has been part of another consortium called the Michigan Life Sciences Corridor, which aims to develop biotechnology research in the State of Michigan. The College of Communication Arts and Sciences' Quello Center researches current issues of information and communication management.

40|$|Part 2 : Large Scale and Complex Information Systems for DevelopmentInternational audienceWhile {{open source}} health {{information}} <b>software</b> <b>platforms</b> provide developing countries a low-cost, quick and less risky {{way to build}} health information systems as compared to in-house solutions, human resource capacity challenges can limit their ability to leverage such platforms. Drawing from a case study focusing on the deployment and operation phases of the DHIS 2 platform in Malawi, we observe open source <b>software</b> <b>platforms</b> require a range of human resource capacities that go beyond capacity to use the platform. To fully leverage open source health information <b>software</b> <b>platforms</b> entails the availability of platform usage capacity, platform deployment capacity, platform customisation capacity and platform module development capacity. Most capacity building initiatives for information systems in developing countries have been short-term efforts focused on initial end user capacity to use such systems. However, to cope with rapid innovations and evolution associated with open source <b>software</b> <b>platforms,</b> capacity building {{ought to be a}} continuous process encompassing a range of human resource capacities not only use of the platform...|$|R

In this paper the challenges for each type of ecosystems are identified from an architectural point of view. Platform leaders can use our analysis to orchestrate their platform by proactively addressing the challenges that we identify and properly evolving the scope and technology design of their platforms...|$|R
