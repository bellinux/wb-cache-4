Electrical conduction of metals is a well-known phenomenon and is attributed to the free conduction electrons, which can be measured as sketched in the figure. The current density j is observed to be proportional to the applied electric field and follows Ohm's law where the prefactor is the specific electrical conductivity.

We present measurements from a high-arctic continuous, maritime permafrost site near Ny Alesund, Svalbard (Norway). The area under investigation features a great diversity of soil types and soil water contents. Sparse vegetation alternating with rock fields and exposed soil characterize the surface. A total of 25 different transects each of 47. 5 m length were investigated using a DC-Resistivity and Electrode Control System (RESECS) with 96 electrodes at a spacing of 0. 5 m in Wenner-alpha configuration. At three transects, fixed electrode arrays were installed and measured on a weekly basis in order to capture temporal changes. The study was conducted from August until mid-September, thus covering the period of maximum active layer thickness and the beginning of freeze-up. The <b>specific</b> <b>resistivities</b> at the surface ranged from less than 50 Ohm m in areas with damp clay to more than 1000 Ohm m in rock fields and on dry hill crests. In most cases, areas with such high resistivities only extended to depths of less than 1 m. From depths between 1 m and 1. 5 m onwards, <b>specific</b> <b>resistivities</b> increased continuously, indicating the position of the freeze-thaw interface. This agrees well with thaw depths that were determined by point measurements along individual transects using a drill.

Afterwards, only insignificant changes were observed at these depths. This is interpreted to be the seasonal thawing of the active layer, which stagnates during in the second half of August.
