25|$|Although today many use calculators and {{computers}} instead of abaci to calculate, abaci still remain in common use in some countries. Merchants, traders and clerks {{in some parts}} of Eastern Europe, Russia, China and Africa use abaci, and they are still used to teach arithmetic to children. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> unable to use a calculator because of visual impairment may use an abacus.|$|E
500|$|Economics is {{no longer}} a fit {{conversation}} piece for ladies and gentlemen. It has become a technical subject. Like any technical subject it attracts <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> more interested in the technique than the subject. That is too bad, but it may be inevitable. In any case, do not kid yourself: the technical core of economics is indispensable infrastructure for the political economy. That is why, if you consult [...] looking for enlightenment about the world today, you will be led to technical economics, or history, or nothing at all.|$|E
500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law called me up saying that I {{needed to talk to}} my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So there are <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It just goes to show that you never know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E

50|$|During 1997, disillusionment {{among some}} {{residents}} on Bradley Park {{led to the}} brief formation of a second association there, {{in opposition to the}} existing resident group.

"Unaffiliated" [...] {{does not}} {{necessarily}} mean [...] "non-religious". <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> unaffiliated with any particular religion express religious beliefs (such as belief in one or more gods or in reincarnation) and engage in religious practices (such as prayer).|$|E
2500|$|HR sees {{chemical}} {{dependency and}} related behaviors {{as a response}} to a lack of a sense of self-efficacy, rather than the result of disease. That is, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are,</b> in HR terms, [...] "unaware" [...] of their own [...] "innate health" [...] and their own role in creating stress via their thoughts turn to alcohol, drugs, or other compulsive behaviors in the attempt to quell their stressful feelings and regain some momentary sense of control. [...] HR aims to offer deeper relief by showing that negative and stressful feelings are self-generated and thus can be self-quieted and it seeks to provide a pathway to well-being that does not depend on external circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|Short sellers must {{be aware}} of the {{potential}} for a short squeeze. [...] When the price of a stock rises significantly, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> shorting the stock cover their positions to limit their losses (this may occur in an automated way if the short sellers had stop-loss orders in place with their brokers); others may be forced to close their position to meet a margin call; others may be forced to cover, subject to the terms under which they borrowed the stock, if the person who lent the stock wishes to sell and take a profit. [...] Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stock's price, which in turn may trigger additional covering. [...] Because of this, most short sellers restrict their activities to heavily traded stocks, and they {{keep an eye on the}} [...] "short interest" [...] levels of their short investments. [...] Short interest is defined as the total number of shares that have been legally sold short, but not covered. A short squeeze can be deliberately induced. [...] This can happen when large investors (such as companies or wealthy individuals) notice significant short positions, and buy many shares, with the intent of selling the position at a profit to the short sellers, who may be panicked by the initial uptick or who are forced to cover their short positions to avoid margin calls.|$|E

2500|$|The Luncheon on the Grass is the {{greatest}} work of Édouard Manet, {{one in which he}} realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape. [...] We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty. [...] There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. [...] This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. [...] My God! [...] What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! [...] That has never been seen. [...] And this belief is a gross error, for in the Louvre there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude. [...] But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. [...] The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging The Luncheon on the Grass like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience. [...] Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. [...] Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of The Luncheon on the Grass is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. [...] That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves. [...] It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.|$|E

60|$|For though I {{would like}} to go into an Indian Brahmin's house, and see the punkahs, and the purdahs and tattys, and the pretty brown maidens with great eyes, and great nose-rings, and painted foreheads, and slim waists cased in Cashmir shawls, Kincob scarfs, curly slippers, gilt trousers, {{precious}} anklets and bangles; and have the mystery of Eastern existence revealed to me (as who would not who has read the Arabian Nights in his youth?), yet I would not choose the moment when the Brahmin of the house was dead, his women howling, his priests doctoring his child of a widow, now frightening her with sermons, now drugging her with bang, so as to push her on his funeral pile at last, and into the arms of that carcase, stupefied, but obedient and decorous. And though I like to walk, even in fancy, in an earl's house, splendid, well ordered, where there are feasts and fine pictures and fair ladies and endless books and good company; yet there are times when the visit is not pleasant; and when the parents in that fine house are getting ready their daughter for sale, and frightening away her tears with threats, and stupefying her grief with narcotics, praying her and imploring her, and dramming her and coaxing her, and blessing her, and cursing her perhaps, till they have brought her into such a state as shall fit the poor young thing for that deadly couch upon which they are about to thrust her. When my lord and lady are so engaged I prefer not to call at their mansion, Number 1000 in Grosvenor Square, but to partake of a dinner of herbs rather than of that stalled ox which their cook is roasting whole. There are <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not so squeamish. The family comes, of course; the Most Reverend the Lord Arch-Brahmin of Benares will attend the ceremony; there will be flowers and lights and white favours; and quite a string of carriages up to the pagoda; and such a breakfast afterwards; and music in the street and little parish boys hurrahing; and no end of speeches within and tears shed (no doubt), and His Grace the Arch-Brahmin will make a highly appropriate speech, just with a faint scent of incense about it as such a speech ought to have; and the young person will slip away unperceived, and take off her veils, wreaths, orange-flowers, bangles and finery, and will put on a plain dress more suited for the occasion, and the house-door will open--and there comes the SUTTEE in company of the body: yonder the pile is waiting on four wheels with four horses, the crowd hurrahs and the deed is done.|$|E
