40|$|A {{method of}} {{preparation}} of specimens of non-electropolishable materials for analysis by atom probes is being developed as a superior alternative to a prior method. In comparison with the prior method, the present method involves less processing time. Also, whereas the prior method yields irregularly shaped and sized specimens, the present developmental method offers the potential to prepare specimens of regular shape and size. The prior method is called the method of sharp shards because it involves crushing the material of interest and selecting microscopic sharp shards of the material for use as specimens. Each selected shard is oriented with its sharp tip facing away {{from the tip of}} a <b>stainless-steel</b> <b>pin</b> and is glued to the tip of the pin by use of silver epoxy. Then the shard is milled by use of a focused ion beam (FIB) to make the shard very thin (relative to its length) and to make its tip sharp enough for atom-probe analysis. The method of sharp shards is extremely time-consuming because the selection of shards must be performed {{with the help of a}} microscope, the shards must be positioned on the pins by use of micromanipulators, and the irregularity of size and shape necessitates many hours of FIB milling to sharpen each shard. In the present method, a flat slab of the material of interest (e. g., a polished sample of rock or a coated semiconductor wafer) is mounted in the sample holder of a dicing saw of the type conventionally used to cut individual integrated circuits out of the wafers on which they are fabricated in batches. A saw blade appropriate to the material of interest is selected. The depth of cut and the distance between successive parallel cuts is made such that what is left after the cuts is a series of thin, parallel ridges on a solid base. Then the workpiece is rotated 90 and the pattern of cuts is repeated, leaving behind a square array of square posts on the solid base. The posts can be made regular, long, and thin, as required for samples for atom-probe analysis. Because of their small volume and regularity, the amount of FIB-milling time can be much less than that of the method of sharp shards. Individual posts can be broken off for mounting in a manner similar to that of the method of sharp shards. Alternatively, the posts can be left intact on the base and the base can be cut to a small square (e. g., 3 by 3 mm) suitable for mounting in an atom probe of a type capable of accepting multiple-tip specimens. The advantage of multiple-tip specimens is the possibility of analyzing many tips without the time-consuming interchange of specimens...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} ceramic {{capillary}} tips generally {{used in the}} microelectronics industry {{for the production of}} DNA microarrays. The ceramic tips improve the morphology of microarray elements, allow higher element density, and increase printing tip life over the customary slotted <b>stainless-steel</b> <b>pins.</b> Ceramic tips are less expensive than steel pins and allow printing from 1536 -well sample source plates. In this work, we describe experiments that establish printing performance of the ceramic tips and hybridization experiments that show that DNA hybridization is unaffected by the choice of tip material...|$|R
40|$|Use of {{biodiesel}} produces {{engine oil}} dilution because of unburned biodiesel impinging on cold {{walls of the}} combustion chamber, being scrapped to the oil pan, and leading to changes of oil friction, wear and lubricity properties. In this paper, mixtures of SAE 15 W- 40 oil, which were contaminated by known percentages of the biodiesels from canola oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, and chicken fat, were tested in a pin-on-disk tribometer. A contact was employed of AISI 1018 steel disk and AISI 316 <b>stainless-steel</b> ball for <b>pin</b> material, and friction force and specific wear were measured. Wear on the disk surfaces showed that any degree of mineral-oil dilution by the tested biodiesels reduces the wear protection of engine oil even at small mixture percentages. However, these reductions were not substantially different than those observed for same percentages of dilution of mineral oil by fossil diesel. The tested mixture of oil contaminated with animal fat feedstock (e. g., chicken fat) biodiesel showed the best wear behavior as compared to those for the other tested mixtures (of mineral oil with vegetable feedstock biodiesel dilutions). Obtained results are discussed as baseline for further studies in a renewable energy multidisciplinary approach on biofuels and biolubes...|$|R
