Frequency and diagnostic utility of cognitive <b>test</b> <b>instrument</b> use by GPs prior to memory clinic referral. Family Practice 2007; 24 : 495 – 497. Background. Previous {{studies have indicated}} not only that cases of dementia are missed in pri-mary care but also that many non-demented patients are referred for evaluation to secondary care. Objectives. To measure frequency of cognitive <b>test</b> <b>instrument</b> use in primary care prior to patient referral to secondary care and to assess the relationship between instrument use and ultimate diagnosis. Methods. This was a prospective study conducted in a Cognitive Function Clinic, Regional Neu-roscience Centre setting. The referral letters for all patients seen in the clinic over a 2 -year period (n = 231) were examined for mention of cognitive <b>test</b> <b>instrument</b> use. Patients were evaluated by standard clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods and diagnoses were made according to widely accepted diagnostic criteria for dementia and dementia subtype. Primary care cognitive test use and final diagnosis were then compared. Results. Evidence of cognitive test use in primary care was found in 20 % of referrals.

30|$|Given the {{limitations}} we describe, the existing body of terrestrial literature regarding thermal decomposition behavior of minerals {{is still a}} useful starting point for additional study. When data are returned from Mars, they {{can be compared to}} terrestrial data that inform the selection of minerals to be run in <b>testbed</b> <b>instruments.</b> To best reproduce results obtained on Mars, these <b>testbed</b> <b>instruments</b> will need to have run the same (or very similar) samples that were run in flight (FM) or engineering qualifying models (EQM) of the instruments on Mars. Since each flight instrument is essentially unique (with perhaps the exception of an EQM) and imitating the exact Mars/spacecraft environment is difficult at best, reproducing the exact instrument conditions in the lab is not feasible. By running the same samples in <b>testbed</b> <b>instruments</b> that were run in FM or EQMs, the differences in decomposition behavior can be measured and explained, allowing for more confident identification of unknown minerals measured in situ. Fortunately, the SAM instrument carries a known mineral standard (calcite) that will be measured on Mars. This measurement will be invaluable in calibrating <b>testbed</b> <b>instruments</b> that will attempt to reproduce the results obtained on Mars to identify unknown minerals.|$|R
