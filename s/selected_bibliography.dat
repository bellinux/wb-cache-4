2500|$|Patrides wrote {{informative}} introductions and annotations {{as part of}} his {{preparation of}} critical editions of literary works. His edition of the English prose of Milton discussed Milton's literary leadership in the English Reformation and Civil War. In this work, Patrides noted appreciations and misappropriations of Milton by later writers, particularly Romantics, who neglected the Christian discipline of Milton's thought and practice. Patrides prepared two Everyman editions of the collected poems of Donne and Herbert, two leading Metaphysical poets. Both prefaces noted his aim “to avoid the impertinence of mere paraphrases” while providing essential contextual information to aid the contemporary reader. Despite his prodigious knowledge of literature and of religious history, Patrides eschewed elaborate annotations that would distract readers from the text itself. Restrained annotation allowed readers to experience the semantic harmonics of Metaphysical poetry and of Milton, the most allusive writer of the English Renaissance. [...] For additional explanation, [...] readers should consult first the Oxford English Dictionary and second his <b>selected</b> <b>bibliography.</b> Patrides's editing and his commentaries were called reverential by Frye. [...] In the judgment of Summers and Pebworth, “Patrides's Olympian style remains distinctive, characterized not only by its mannered elegance of phrasing, but preeminently by a kind of sophisticated wit that incorporates playfulness and amusement even in the most serious of observations and that prevents even the most magisterial pronouncements from ever sounding pompous or self-important.” ...|$|E
