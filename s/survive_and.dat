5|$|Individuals less {{suited to}} the {{environment}} {{are less likely to}} <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> less likely to reproduce; individuals more {{suited to the}} environment are more likely to <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> more likely to reproduce and leave their heritable traits to future generations, which produces the process of natural selection (fact).|$|E

5|$|A {{pathogen}} is only {{successful in}} infecting an organism {{if it can}} get past its defenses. Pathogenic bacteria and protozoa have developed {{a variety of methods}} to resist attacks by phagocytes, and many actually <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> replicate within phagocytic cells.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 13th century, North Buckinghamshire had several {{religious}} houses: Bradwell Abbey (1154) is within modern Milton Keynes and Snelshall Priory (1218) is just outside it. Both were Benedictine priories. Many {{of the medieval}} trackways to these sites still <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> have become cycleways and footpaths of the Redway network.|$|E
5|$|More {{offspring}} {{are produced}} than can possibly <b>survive,</b> <b>and</b> these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that {{give them an}} advantage over their competitors {{are more likely to}} pass on their traits to the next generation than those with traits that do not confer an advantage.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of genetic drift can be illustrated with a simplified example. Consider {{a very large}} colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution. The bacteria are genetically identical except for a single gene with two alleles labeled A and B. A and B are neutral alleles meaning {{that they do not}} affect the bacteria's ability to <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally likely to <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> reproduce. Suppose that half the bacteria have allele A and the other half have allele B. Thus A and B each have allele frequency 1/2.|$|E

5|$|A-line. Founded by Anselmo, born 1926. One of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} lines today, descendants include the second-largest number of stallions at stud. Anselmo was brought back to stud {{at the age of}} 21, when a lack of stallions after World War II led to concerns that the line would not <b>survive,</b> <b>and</b> produced several stallions now represented in all Haflinger breeding populations worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to <b>survive,</b> <b>and</b> instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the tension in late-December, the {{standoff}} remained. The US hoped the generals would relent because they could not <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> be able to repel the communists or rival officers without aid from Washington. On the other hand, Khánh and the Young Turks expected the Americans would become more worried about the communist gains first and acquiesce to their fait accompli against the HNC. The generals were correct.|$|E

5|$|Batesian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Henry W. Bates. When an edible prey animal comes to resemble, even slightly, a distasteful animal, natural selection favours those individuals that even very slightly better resemble the distasteful species. This is because {{even a small}} degree of protection reduces predation and increases the chance that an individual mimic will <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> reproduce. For example, many species of hoverfly are coloured black and yellow like bees, and are in consequence avoided by birds (and people).|$|E
5|$|Cabin in the Cotton (1932) is a Warner Bros. message {{film about}} the evils of capitalism. The film takes place in an {{unspecified}} southern state where workers are given barely enough to <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> taken advantage of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high prices by unscrupulous landowners. The film is decidedly anti-capitalist; however, its preface claims otherwise: In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and agree to a more equitable distribution of capital.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{regarding}} the artwork's commissioning <b>survive</b> <b>and,</b> unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece, the artist, patron, place of installation and {{date of completion}} are all known. It was intended as the centrepiece for the chapel, and Rolin approached van der Weyden around 1443, when the hospital was founded. The altarpiece was ready by 1451, the year the chapel was consecrated. Painted in van der Weyden's Brussels workshop– most likely {{with the aid of}} apprentices – the completed panels were then transported to the hospice. The altarpiece is first mentioned in a 1501 inventory, when it was positioned on the high altar.|$|E

The severed head is able to <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> wave its antennae for several hours, or longer when refrigerated and given nutrients.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} he arrived in Tucson, Kelly sat vigil at his wife's bedside as she {{struggled}} to <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> began to recover. As her condition began to improve, the Kelly-Giffords family researched options for rehabilitation facilities and chose one in Houston. On January 21, Giffords {{was transferred to the}} Memorial Hermann–Texas Medical Center, where she spent five days prior to moving to TIRR Memorial Hermann, where she continued her recovery and rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a mutation {{is a change}} in the base sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> reproduce.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} mouse embryo, cytoplasmic {{polyadenylation}} of maternal RNAs from the egg cell allows the cell to <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> grow even though transcription does not start {{until the middle}} of the 2-cell stage (4-cell stage in human). In the brain, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is active during learning and could play a role in long-term potentiation, which is the strengthening of the signal transmission from a nerve cell to another in response to nerve impulses and is important for learning and memory formation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} range, {{parts of the}} medieval {{buildings}} <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> are incorporated into staircase ten — the straight, steep flight of stairs and timber framed partitions date from a mid-15th century rebuilding of St Mary Hall. The former Chapel, Hall and Buttery of St Mary Hall, built in 1640, form part of the Junior Library and Junior Common Room. Viewed from the third quad, the Chapel, with its Gothic windows, {{can be seen to}} have been built neatly on top of the Hall, a unique example in Oxford of such a plan.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Helen visits Edna and learns what Bob {{has been}} up to. Edna {{activates}} a beacon she built into the suits so Helen can find Bob, inadvertently causing him to be discovered and captured. Helen borrows a private plane to head for Nomanisan, but Violet and Dash have stowed away wearing their own suits, leaving Jack-Jack with a babysitter. Syndrome shoots down Helen's plane, but she and the children <b>survive</b> <b>and</b> reach the island. When Bob is informed that his family is dead, he grabs and threatens to kill Mirage, but relents when Syndrome calls his bluff.|$|E
