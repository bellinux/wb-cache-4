When the frequency of alternating pressure load applied on them is 10  Hz and {{the magnitude of the}} load is 10  kPa, cymbal slotted diaphragm has its maximum Von-Mises stress which is 0.036  kPa, and the <b>slotted</b> <b>flat</b> diaphragm is 0.249  kPa. That is, the cymbal slotted diaphragm is smaller than the <b>slotted</b> <b>flat</b> diaphragm in stress, so the cymbal slotted diaphragm has a high reliability.|$|E
30|$|Valve {{piezoelectric}} pumps {{usually have}} larger flow rate {{than that of}} valveless ones. However, the traditional cantilever valve easily induces stress concentration which impacts the reliability of pumps. Therefore, a cymbal-shaped slotted check valve is proposed to be applied in a piezoelectric pump {{in order to reduce}} the stress concentration of the valve and thus improve the reliability of the piezoelectric pump. The structure and working principle of the piezoelectric pump are analyzed; the stress analysis of the cymbal-shaped slotted valve diaphragm is conducted. In addition, finite element software is employed to analyze the difference of the Von-Mises stress between the cymbal-shaped slotted diaphragm and the <b>slotted</b> <b>flat</b> diaphragm. The simulation results show that, the Von-Mises stress of cymbal-shaped slotted diaphragm is smaller than that of the <b>slotted</b> <b>flat</b> one. Furthermore, the cymbal-shaped slotted valve piezoelectric pump is also fabricated, and flow rate experiment is performed. The experimental results indicate that the flow rate of piezoelectric pump working in low frequencies (0  Hz < f <  50  Hz) is larger than that working in high frequencies (200  Hz < f <  2000  Hz). When driven at voltage of 160  V and frequency of 5  Hz, the pump reaches its maximum flow rate of 6.6  g/min. The experimental results validate the feasibility of the cymbal-shaped slotted check valve. This research can effectively solve the problem of stress concentration of valve piezoelectric pumps and is helpful for improving the reliability of them.|$|E

40|$|The {{inspection}} of wall loss corrosion is difficult at pipe supports due to limited accessibility. The recently developed ultrasonic Multi-Skip screening technique {{is suitable for}} this problem. The method employs ultrasonic transducers in a pitch-catch geometry positioned {{on opposite sides of}} the pipe support. Shear waves are transmitted in the axial direction within the pipe wall, reflecting multiple times between the inner and outer surfaces before reaching the receivers. Along this path, the signals accumulate information on the integral wall thickness (e. g., via variations in travel time). The method is very sensitive in detecting the presence of wall loss, but it is difficult to quantify both the extent and depth of the loss. Multi-skip tomography has been developed to reconstruct the wall thickness profile along the axial direction of the pipe. The method uses model-based full wave field inversion; this consists of a forward model for predicting the measured wave field and an iterative process that compares the predicted and measured wave fields and minimizes the differences with respect to the model parameters (i. e., the wall thickness profile). Experimental results are very encouraging. Various defects (<b>slot</b> and <b>flat</b> bottom hole) are reconstructed using the tomographic inversion. The general shape and width are well recovered.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} wall-bounded {{open cavity}} {{may be considered}} as a simplified geometry found in industrial applications such as leading gear or <b>slotted</b> <b>flats</b> on the airplane. Understanding the three-dimensional complex flow structure that surrounds this particular geometry is therefore of major industrial interest. At the light of the remarkable former investigations in this kind of flows, enough evidences suggest that the lateral walls have a great influence on the flow features and hence on their instability modes. Nevertheless, even though there is a large body of literature on cavity flows, most of them are {{based on the assumption that}} the flow is two-dimensional and spanwise-periodic. The flow over realistic open cavity should be considered. This thesis presents an investigation of three-dimensional wall-bounded open cavity with geometric ratio 6 : 2 : 1. To this aim, three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and global linear instability have been performed. Linear instability analysis reveals that the onset of the first instability in this open cavity is around Recr 1080. The three-dimensional shear layer mode with a complex structure is shown to be the most unstable mode. I t is noteworthy that the flow pattern of this high-frequency shear layer mode is similar to the observed unstable oscillations in supercritical unstable case. DNS of the cavity flow carried out at different Reynolds number from steady state until a nonlinear saturated state is obtained. The comparison of time histories of kinetic energy presents a clearly dominant energetic mode which shifts between low-frequency and highfrequency oscillation. A complete flow patterns from subcritical cases to supercritical case has been put in evidence. The flow structure at the supercritical case Re= 1100 resembles typical wake-shedding instability oscillations with a lateral motion existed in the subcritical cases. Also, This flow pattern is similar to the observations in experiments. In order to validate the linear instability analysis results, the topology of the composite flow fields reconstructed by linear superposition of a three-dimensional base flow and its leading three-dimensional global eigenmodes has been studied. The instantaneous wall streamlines of those composited flows display distinguish influence region of each eigenmode. Attention has been focused on the leading high-frequency shear layer mode; the composite flow fields have been fully recognized with respect to the downstream wave shedding. The three-dimensional shear layer mode is shown to give rise to a typical wake-shedding instability with a lateral motions occurring downstream which is in good agreement with the experiment results. Moreover, the spanwise-periodic, open cavity with the same length to depth ratio has been also studied. The most unstable linear mode is different from the real three-dimensional cavity flow, because of the existence of the side walls. Structure sensitivity of the unstable global mode is analyzed in the flow control context. The adjoint-based sensitivity analysis has been employed to localized the receptivity region, where the flow is more sensible to momentum forcing and mass injection. Because of the non-normality of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations, the direct and adjoint field has a large spatial separation. The strongest sensitivity region is locate in the upstream lip of the three-dimensional cavity. This numerical finding is in agreement with experimental observations. Finally, a prototype of passive flow control strategy is applied...|$|R

Rather than a <b>flat</b> <b>slot</b> structure, we use a hierarchy that contains slots at various levels of abstraction.

Depending on {{the success or failure of}} certain questions, the system can zoom-in to more detailed questions, or zoom-out to higher-level questions. The distribution of initiative in dialogue is closely related to the granularity of the information that is asked for. To determine the right granularity level for system questions we have to take into account the influences on user freedom, predictability and the knowledge of the user. Giving the user initiative is suitable in situations where the user knows what to do. In such cases, the user may give all relevant information in one turn. However, giving the user more initiative tends to make his behaviour less predictable and therefore increases the chance on speech-understanding errors. The system should switch to lower-level questions when higher-level ones fail, and when the user supplies unsolicited information, the system can switch to higher-level question...|$|R
40|$|A {{temperature}} gradient is applied along a fluid filled <b>slot</b> with a <b>flat</b> upper interface, establishing flow via thermocapillarity and/or buoyancy. There is a known parallel flow along the slot, {{in which the}} fluid velocity varies vertically, {{and there is a}} known convected temperature profile. This parallel flow is then subjected to gravitational modulation or “jitter” which is applied at low frequency and in various directions. For gravity modulations in the plane of the basic flow, analytic solutions for velocity and temperature profiles are obtained for jitter of arbitrary amplitude. These solutions involve modifications to the earlier parallel flow solutions. Jitter in the vertical direction generates vorticity due to coupling with the applied horizontal {{temperature gradient}}. This alternately cooperates or competes with the steady basic flow over a cycle of the modulation, but does not qualitatively change the flow or temperature profiles. Jitter applied along the slot produces vorticity only when coupled to vertical convected temperature gradients and so is important when the basic flow is sufficiently strong (large Marangoni and/or Rayleigh number). Various cases are considered for the basic flow, which may be driven by thermocapillarity alone, by vertical gravity alone or by a mixture of thermocapillarity and vertical gravity. When strong streamwise jitter is added to any of these cases, the flow profile alternates during the modulation cycle between boundary layer structures and vertically stacked cells. The type of structure selected depends on the sense of the horizontal thermal stratification with respect to the jitter, and {{in that part of the}} cycle where this stratification is unstable, there are particular amplitudes of jitter which can give strong cellular motions or runaways. These runaways represent a resonant interaction with stationary Rayleigh-Bénard cells...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{considerable}} interest in high power automotive alternators. As part of earlier work, an interior permanent magnet machine had been built as a concept demonstrator for a 6 kW automotive alternator. Test results on this machine had shown good field-weakening performance but that the machine fell 16 % short of the idle power requirement and had high iron losses. This thesis describes the development of a finite-element model for this machine and how it was validated using experimental test results and used to examine the cause of the low idle power and high iron losses. A limited optimisation of the machine design to reduce iron losses was examined and demonstrated experimentally. It was found that the cause of the low idle power was due to cross-saturation effects in the machine, particularly in the stator teeth. Both the finite-element analysis and experimental tests showed a substantial reduction in the q-axis inductance due to the presence of the magnet flux. It was predicted that the machine would have met the idle power requirement if saturation and cross-saturation had not been present. The high iron loss during field-weakening was identified as being due to large amplitude, higher harmonic flux components caused by the interaction of the rotor barriers and the d-axis flux distribution. This was seen in the spatial airgap flux density and the time-varying stator tooth flux waveforms. The analysis also showed that eddy-current loss was dominant in this machine at higher speeds, and that under short-circuit conditions the majority of the iron loss was due to large thirteenth and eleventh harmonic flux density components. This was confirmed experimentally using the stator tooth flux waveforms and the total iron loss measurement. A limited design optimisation was performed by examining three machine design changes to reduce the high stator iron loss under short-circuit conditions. Of these, increasing the stator <b>slot</b> opening using <b>flat</b> stator teeth offered the greatest calculated iron loss reduction (19 %). This was tested experimentally by machining the stator teeth of the prototype machine. The measured iron loss reduction (21 %) at high speed was comparable to the calculated effect, and the output power was shown to improve slightly. The results of the detailed iron loss investigation in this thesis forms a basis for development for more general machine design approaches for reducing stator iron loss under field-weakening conditions in interior permanent magnet machines.
