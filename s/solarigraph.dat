40|$|In {{order to}} obtain a more {{accurate}} evaluation of efficiency {{of the solar system}} the measurements of global irradiation by Moll-Gorczynski <b>solarigraph</b> were analysed with respect to levels of energy instead to arithmetic means of irradiation. The time variation of irradiation levels in daily and yearly course is considered. The structure of global irradiation energy presented on the tilted plane and put in the mathematical model improved the simulation of work of the entire solar installatio...|$|E
