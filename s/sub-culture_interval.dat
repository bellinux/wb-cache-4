40|$|Taro is a {{potential}} source of carbohydratefor anticipation of climate change. In vitro technology havenot been widely implemented for tuber crops conservation. Conservation of the crops is mostly conducted in field. Suchconservation is very susceptible to biotic and abiotic stress. The research consisted of two activities i. e: micropropagationand conservation. The objectives were to obtain taro invitro propagation and conservation method. The trial wasarranged in a factorial design with six replications. Five taroaccessions were used as the first factor for each study. Thesecond factor in propagation study was propagation mediumi. e: MS; MS + 2. 9 μM IAA + 4. 4 μM BA and MS + 2. 9 μM IAA+ 22, 2 μM BA. Shoot tip from taro sucker was used asexplant. The second factor in conservation study was MSmedium containing mannitol (0, 30, 40, and 50 g/l). Twoleavesin vitro shoots from micropropagation study was usedas explants. The addition of BA in MS medium + 2. 9 μM IAAincreased the number of shoot of taro germplasm. The bestmedium for micropropagation of taro germplasm No. 21 andTalas Jahe is MS + 2, 9 μM IAA + 4, 4 μM BA, whereas thebest medium for No. 503, Talas Jahe and Lumbu Banten isMS + 2, 9 μM IAA + 22, 2 μM BA. Based on data of plantheight, percentage of leaf life and shelf life, MS medium +manitol 40 g/l was the best medium for taro germplasmconservation with prolong <b>sub-culture</b> <b>interval...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of cultural conditions upon {{the loss of}} virulence in laboratory cultures of Pas-teurella pestis has been noted in the literature. Devignat and Schoetter (1942) reported that 2 highly virulent strains became avirulent after 30 to 36 days when serially transferred in aerated broth at 37 C. Pollitzer (1954) summarized additional conditions under which loss in viru-lence occurred. These included repeated <b>sub-culture</b> at weekly <b>intervals,</b> action of bacterio-phage, cultivation on bile media, prolonged incubation of the broth cultures at 32 C (Otten's procedure), growth in alcohol-broth at 32 C {{for long periods of}} time, and passage of virulent strains through immune animals. The latter 3 conditions were used by Jawetz and Meyer (1943) in producing avirulent strains for their studies on immunity. Data are presented in this paper which indicate that the virulence of P. pestis strains was main-tained when serially transferred in aerated broth at 26 C, or on agar slants at 26 or 37 C. However, a striking reduction in virulence was observed when P. pestis strains were cultured in aerated broth at 37 C from large inocula and serially transferred, or from small inocula without sub-sequent transfer. This attenuation of plague cultures was due to the selection of avirulent variants present in the inoculum or arising during growth. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three strains of virulent P. pestis originally isolated from human cases were employed: (1...|$|R
