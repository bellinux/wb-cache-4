This Convention was opposed by trade groups representing authors and composers, who were concerned that establishing such [...] "neighbouring rights" [...] would undermine their own control over how their works were used and would result in prohibitively expensive licensing. Pressure from United States-based broadcasters who didn't want to license the records they broadcast, among other factors, kept the United States from signing the Convention; the United States would not recognise a <b>separate</b> <b>sound</b> <b>recording</b> copyright until 1971.|$|E
40|$|An online blind source {{separation}} algorithm {{which is}} a special case of the geometric algorithm by Parra and Fancourt [1] has been implemented {{for the purpose of}} <b>separating</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>recorded</b> at microphones placed at each side of the head. By using the assumption that the position of the two sounds are known, the source separation algorithm has been geometrically constrained. Since the separation takes place in a non free-field, a head-related transfer function (HRTF) is used to simulate the response between microphones placed at the two ears. The use of a HRTF instead of assuming free-field improves the separation with approximately 1 dB compared to when free-field is assumed. This indicates that the permutation ambiguity is solved more accurate compared to when free-field is assumed. 1...|$|R

"Silence," [...] Franklin writes, [...] "possesses {{striking}} similarities [...] {{aspects of}} life and community, such as unpolluted water, air, or soil, that were once taken as normal and given, but have become special and precious in technologically mediated environments." [...] She argues that the technological ability to <b>separate</b> <b>recorded</b> <b>sound</b> from its source makes the sound as permanent as the Muzak that plays endlessly in public places without anyone's consent. For Franklin, such canned music is a manipulative technology programmed to generate predictable emotional responses and to increase private profit. She compares this destruction of silence to the British enclosure laws which fenced off the commons for private farming.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Given a {{time series}} of {{multicomponent}} measurements x(t), the usual objective of nonlinear blind source separation (BSS) {{is to find}} a “source ” time series s(t), comprised of statistically independent combinations of the measured components. In this paper, the source time series is required to have a density function in (s, ˙s) -space that is equal to the product of density functions of individual components. This formulation of the BSS problem has a solution that is unique, up to permutations and component-wise transformations. Separability is shown to impose constraints on certain locally invariant (scalar) functions of x, which are derived from local higher-order correlations of the data’s velocity ˙x. The data are separable if and only if they satisfy these constraints, and, if the constraints are satisfied, the sources can be explicitly constructed from the data. The method is illustrated by using it to <b>separate</b> two speech-like <b>sounds</b> <b>recorded</b> with a single microphone. I...|$|R

40|$|Robot {{capability}} of hearing sounds, in particular, {{a mixture of}} sounds, by its own microphones, that is, robot audition, is important in improving human robot interaction. This paper presents the robot audition open-source software, called “HARK ” (HRI-JP Audition for Robots with Kyoto University), which consists of primitive functions in computational auditory scene analysis; sound source localization, separation, and recognition of <b>separated</b> <b>sounds.</b> Since <b>separated</b> <b>sounds</b> suffer from spectral distortion due to separation, the HARK generates a time-spectral map of reliability, called “missing feature mask”, for features of <b>separated</b> <b>sounds.</b> Then <b>separated</b> <b>sounds</b> are recognized by the Missing-Feature Theory (MFT) based ASR with missing feature masks. The HARK is implemented on the middleware called “FlowDesigner ” to share intermediate audio data, which enables near real-time processing.
