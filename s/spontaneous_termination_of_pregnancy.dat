40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} that during pregnancy a large variety of non-gynaecological abdominal pathologies can be safely managed with surgery. Methods: The medical records of twenty-three patients that were pregnant and underwent open or laparoscopic surgery from 1997 to 2007 were reviewed. Results: Twenty-one of the 23 patients have given birth and all but one of the babies were healthy with normal weights, sizes, and APGAR scores. One patient had <b>spontaneous</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> one week after the surgical procedure and one patient is out of follow-up. Preterm partus was induced in three patients due to life-threatening conditions for the mother. Each laparoscopy was performed safely without peri-operative complications. Conclusion: Open or laparoscopic abdominal surgery poses little or no additional risk for mother or child. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Trophoblast cell (CTB) {{invasion}} {{into the}} maternal endometrium plays {{a crucial role}} during human embryo implantation and placentation. This invasion is facilitated by the activity of matrix metalloproteinases, which are regulated by tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs). Methods This study compares the serum levels of MMP- 9, MMP- 2 /TIMP- 2 complex, TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 2 in 129 patients with ongoing pregnancy (n[*]=[*] 40) or spontaneous early pregnancy failure (n[*]=[*] 89). Results MMP- 9 was markedly (p[*] Conclusions Human placentation is mediated by fetal trophoblastic cells that invade the maternal uterine endometrium. Trophoblast invasion requires a precisely regulated secretion of specific proteolytic enzymes able to degrade the endometrial basement membrane and extracellular matrix.

40|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} {{during pregnancy}} {{is a rare}} metabolic condition {{that is associated with}} high maternal and foetal morbidity. Clinical symptoms may mimic those of normal pregnancy. A diagnosis is best made based on clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging findings as well as a high index of suspicion. Medical management with anti-steroidogenic agents such as metyrapone {{has been shown to be}} effective, but surgery is usually the recommended treatment option. Its main limitation is optimal timing of the procedure in late first trimester or early second trimester to prevent <b>spontaneous</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> We describe our experience and management of a 39 -year-old patient with uncontrolled hypertension at 25 weeks gestation which was later diagnosed as ACTH independent Cushing's syndrome and had a favourable pregnancy outcome. The role of medical therapy and its challenges, as well as its impact on pregnancy outcomes, were explored by a literature search conducted through Pubmed and Medline databases. A total of 12 patients with Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy were reported to have been managed with metyrapone, with ketoconazole being studied to a significant degree in three cases. Of these women, 53 % delivered close to term and 20 % developed pre-eclampsia. Despite two neonatal deaths and one stillborn reported, medical management appeared effective in controlling hypercortisolemia during pregnancy with strict monitoring of blood pressure and foetal surveillance. It remains the only active management in the setting of pregnancy-induced Cushing's syndrome, and has shown to be a viable option in controlling serum cortisol levels especially as an adjunct to surgery as reflected in four cases. A multidisciplinary approach towards an individualised management process is warranted with medical management to ensure a safe maternal and foetal outcome. Wei How Lim, David J. Torpy, William S.

40|$|Abstract Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if an association exists between prior induced and prior spontaneous pregnancy termination (PIPT and PSPT) and preterm birth (PTB) of first live births in Virginia. Methods: Data was collected by linking maternal data from Virginia’s live birth and fetal death registries. All first live, singleton births occurring in Virginia from 2000 - 2007 were analyzed. Logistic regression models that controlled for various demographic, medical and obstetric history factors were used to determine associations among prior pregnancy termination types. Results: Compared with women who had no history of previous pregnancy terminations, women who had 1 (OR = 1. 1, 95 % CI 1. 31, 1. 53), 2 (OR = 1. 2, 95 % CI 1. 12, 1. 24) and 3 or more (OR = 1. 4, 95 % CI 1. 07, 1. 13) total prior pregnancy terminations had an increased odds of experiencing PTB. Increased odds of PTB were found for women who had 2 (OR = 1. 1, 95 % CI 1. 05, 1. 18) and 3 or more (OR = 1. 3, 95 % CI 1. 39, 1. 61) PIPTs. Women who reported 1, 2, 3 or more PSPT had PTB odds-ratios of 1. 4 (95 % CI 1. 37, 1. 50), 1. 7 (95 % CI 1. 48, 1. 98) and 3. 0 (95 % CI 2. 09, 4. 22) times, respectively. Conclusion: Two or more PIPT and one or more PSPT were found to be a significant risk factor for PTB of a first live birth in Virginia, and women having 3 or more PSPT had three times the odds of experiencing this outcome.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Data on {{efavirenz}} {{safety in}} first trimester pregnancy are conflicting. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis {{of the available}} evidence from observational cohorts. METHODS: We ran duplicate searches of databases (up to 02 January, 2010) and searchable websites of major HIV conferences (up to February, 2010) to identify observational cohorts reporting birth outcomes among women exposed to efavirenz during the first trimester <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Our primary endpoint was birth defects of any kind; secondary outcomes were <b>spontaneous</b> abortions, <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> stillbirths, and preterm delivery. RESULTS: Sixteen studies met our inclusion criteria, comprising 11 prospective cohorts and five retrospective reviews. Nine prospective studies reported on rates for birth defects both among women exposed to efavirenz-containing regimens (1132 live births) and non-efavirenz-containing regimens (7163 live births) during first trimester, giving a pooled, nonsignificant relative risk of 0. 87 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 61 - 1. 24 %, P = 0. 45]. Low heterogeneity was observed between studies (I = 0, 95 % CI 0 - 56. 3 %, P = 0. 85). Across all studies (1256 live births), one neural tube defect (meningomyelocele) was observed with first trimester efavirenz exposure, giving a prevalence of 0. 08 % (95 % CI 0. 002 - 0. 44 %). CONCLUSION: We found no increased risk of overall birth defects among women exposed to efavirenz during the first trimester <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> compared with exposure to other antiretroviral drugs. Prevalence of overall birth defects with first trimester efavirenz exposure {{was similar to the}} ranges reported in the general population.

40|$|Objective : To {{study the}} current {{legislation}} and trends in <b>terminations</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> in the European Union (EU). Design : Data {{were collected on}} legislation and statistics for <b>terminations</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Setting : Population-based statistics from the EU member states. Population : Women in reproductive age in the 27 EU member states. Methods : Information on legislation was collected for all 27 EU member states. Statistical information until 2008 was compiled from international (n = 24) and national sources (n = 17). Statistical data were not available for Austria, Cyprus and Luxembourg. Main outcomes measures : <b>Terminations</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> per 1000 women aged 15 - 49 years. Results : Ireland, Malta and Poland have restrictive legislation. Luxembourg permits <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> on {{physical and mental health}} indications; Cyprus, Finland, and the UK further include socio-economic indications. In all other EU member states <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> can be performed in early pregnancy on a women's request. In general, the rates <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> have declined in recent years. In total, 10. 3 terminations were reported per 1000 women aged 15 - 49 years in the EU in 2008. The rate was 12. 3 / 1000 for countries requiring a legal indication for termination, and 11. 0 / 1000 for countries allowing termination on request. Northern Europe (10. 9 / 1000) and Central and Eastern Europe (10. 8 / 1000) had higher rates than Southern Europe (8. 9 / 1000). Northern Europe, however, had substantially higher rates <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> among teenagers. Conclusion : A more consistent and coherent reporting <b>of</b> <b>terminations</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> is needed in the EU. The large variation <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> rates between countries suggests that <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> rates may be reduced in some countries without restricting women's access to termination.
