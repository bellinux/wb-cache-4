40|$|We {{consider}} entanglement <b>swapping,</b> a {{key component}} of quantum network operations and entanglement distribution. Pure entangled states, which are the desired input to the <b>swapping</b> protocol, are typically mixed by environmental interactions causing a reduction in their degree of entanglement. Thus an understanding of entanglement <b>swapping</b> with partially mixed states is of importance. Here we present a general analytical solution for entanglement <b>swapping</b> of arbitrary two-qubit states. Our result provides a comprehensive method for analyzing entanglement <b>swapping</b> in quantum networks. First, we show that the concurrence of a partially mixed state is conserved when this state is <b>swapped</b> with a Bell state. Then, we find upper and lower bounds on the concurrence of the state resulting from entanglement <b>swapping</b> for various classes of input states. Finally, we determine a general relationship between the ranks of the initial states and the rank of the final state after <b>swapping...</b>|$|R

40|$|Federal {{and state}} {{agencies}} continue to balance the need to release usable survey data while protecting the confidentiality of the individuals or institutions included in these surveys. The confidentiality standards of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) require (1) the identification and masking of sensitive variables and records and (2) introducing an additional measure of uncertainty with random <b>swapping</b> {{through the use of}} the IES DataSwap software. DataSwap includes three sets of global utility measures to help evaluate the impact of <b>swapping</b> on the weighted distribution of the <b>swapped</b> variables, selected pairwise associations, and coefficients in regression models. The objective of having these measures built into the software is to help users select the best <b>swapping</b> result from several randomly replicated runs generated by using different <b>swapping</b> targets and parameters. In addition to a description of the <b>swapping</b> methodology, in this paper we present each of the global utility measures, explain their characteristics, and their interpretation. We will further demonstrate how the measures may be used to evaluate various <b>swapping</b> scenarios and display the variability among replicated runs. We address how <b>swapping</b> scenarios may be modified to reduce the <b>swapping</b> impact, and present strategies for determining the best <b>swapped</b> dataset for a study. 1. 0 Software The basic idea of data <b>swapping</b> is to transform a database by interchanging, or “swapping ” values of one or more variables between records. The benefit of using <b>swapping</b> as a statistical perturbation technique is that it maintains the unweighted univariate distribution of each variable while still introducing uncertainty about the identity of records since the data intruder does not know which variables or records contain <b>swapped</b> information. Inasmuch as confidentiality in any data file cannot be absolutely assured, the randomized <b>swapping</b> allows the agency to contend that no one can be certain if an individual unit has been identified...|$|R
