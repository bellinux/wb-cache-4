Because of the presence of high amount of air pollutants in the ambient air, the health of the population and property is getting adversely affected. In Mettur thermal power station (MTPS) primary fuel is coal. The requirement of coal per day 14000 tons. The coal transported through railway wagons has been unloaded in wagon Tripler. From the wagon Tripler During the coal unloading activity, enormous coal has been extracted from the coal transfer chute, which in turn polluted the entire coal handling area. Hence, to tide over the problem, it is necessary to go for effective coal control measures in MTPS. In pulse jet bag filter, the coal that is disc lodged from a row of bags may be picked up by the adjacent row of bags as the latter is under suction. The coal may remain is suspended condition- especially if it is light and / or fine- the reverse upward gas flow not allowing the coal to settle in the hopper.

Comparison of residual water content at high suction points (5000 – 15, 000  cm) showed that the residual water content in the rubber-amended soil was also significant, especially at high levels of CR application. The reasons for the increase of moisture in the treatments containing CR can be attributed to increasing porosity, decreasing density and increasing surface area of rubber-amended soils. In this area, Riggle (1994) expressed that incorporating rubber particles in soil could enhance the water use efficiency by up to 30 %. In general, polymers due to their hydrophilic properties are effective in improving soil properties especially in increasing soil moisture content.|$|E

40|$|Mechanical {{behaviour}} of variably saturated clay fills VLADISLAVA KOSTKANOVÁ Ph. D. Thesis - English Abstract The excavated overburden from open-cast {{coal mines}} is end-dumped in fills. Clay type soil prevails among the filled soils in North-western Bohemia. As {{a consequence of}} the character and state of the soil, together with the mining and dumping technology, a typical lumpy structure of the clay fill is formed. The filled lumps range in size and vary in mechanical properties, but stiff to solid lumps up to 0. 5 m in size are prevalent. Large and open macrovoids between the single lumps are a characteristic feature of the clay fills. Clay fills exhibit a double porosity structure, consisting of intergranular porosity between the lumps and intragranular porosity inside them. The total porosity of the freshly filled soils can reach 70 %. This type of clay fill structure is metastable. This thesis focuses on the problematic behaviour of clay fill soils due to their metastable structure and their partly saturated state. Long-term monitoring of matric suction at depths up to 2 metres in two reclaimed clay fills revealed two different trends. Seasonally-dependent suction oscillations were recorded in the moderate slope of the clay fill in the Bílina mine, while no <b>suction</b> <b>pointing</b> to fully saturated conditions was [...] ...|$|R

A primary cause of failure of these systems is due to an incomplete pressure field extension, which allows radon to continue to enter the building. More {{than half of the}} homes which WPB Enterprises mitigates, do not have a good gravel base under the slab. This Project investigated a techniquewhich extends the pressure field in tight soils from a single <b>suction</b> <b>point</b> by creating sub-floor tunnels using a commonly available 3000 psi pressure washer. This technique is a possible choice for mitigators dealing with non-rocky, tight soil and limited choices for suction hole locations. Tunneling under the slab was found to be able to double the existing strength of the pressure field but not to increase the pressure field extension significantly nor to consistently produce a vacuum where none existed before. The study made a comparison between using the water jet to increase the pressure Held extension versus using a high vacuum fan or adding an additional suction hole. Adding an additional suction hole compared favorable with installing a high vacuum fan and was a less expensive option. Both of these alternative options proved successful in mitigating dmcult tight soil houses while the water jet approach was not successful.

40|$|Due to an {{increased}} demand from operator companies for deep-water drilling solutions, an interest in Dual Gradient technologies has risen. An {{example of such a}} technology is Controlled Mud Level (CML) drilling, where a subsea pump integrated in one of the riser joints actively controls the riser level. Reducing the hydrostatic component of the system helps to control pressures down-hole very accurately and fast. For this type of pressure control, an understanding of down-hole parameters as well as precise pressure estimate is required. This can be done by different numerical schemes. The scheme used in this thesis is AUSMV numerical scheme used mostly for academic purposes. In this work, a coupling between this scheme and CML technology mentioned before has been introduced. This thesis has undertaken a literature survey from which it was concluded that CML is a promising technology, which finds compromises between several drilling aspects and makes operations more simple and less time consuming. A detailed review of the historical, technical and operational aspects of the technology was performed. Already existing commercial field applications confirms the future interest in CML. One of the breaking innovations with CML is early kick detection, which allows determining the reservoir influx in less than a minute. Well Control procedures used for the CML are close to Driller’s method. This is an advantage taking into consideration the time used for the training of the personnel. After the technology has been reviewed in detail, simulations in Matlab have been performed to examine the ability of the AUSMV scheme to handle this type of well operations. Special focus was placed on the numerical boundary treatment on top of the well. Several ways of defining the outlet pressure boundary were investigated. In the end, setting the outlet pressure flux equal to 1 atm was concluded to be the best alternative. The scheme was available in two versions, 1 st order and 2 nd order. The updated 2 nd order scheme differs from the original 1 st order scheme by using slope limiters. This reduces numerical diffusion, which is a common problem with numerical schemes. After a comparison of the two schemes, the 2 nd order showed more realistic and smoother results. The simulations of the 1 st order scheme confirmed the problem of negative velocity fields for static conditions. Moreover, the problem with an outlet pressure representation at the beginning of simulations was discovered, which needs further investigation. Next objective for this thesis was to adapt the scheme for the small-scale experimental flow-loop located at University of Stavanger (UIS). Two methods for achieving stable numerical solutions were found. Since the pressures delivered by the approximated small-scale model were very low, the first method involved pressurizing the system with 10 bars. This was a remedy introduced due to the problems the model had with handling the low pressures encountered in this simulation set-up. This was not optimal since it would not be possible to pressurize the system experimentally. However, an alternative method was found by editing a specific pressure condition in the code, which was there initially to assure stability but in this set-up was causing a problem. Both methods were compared and the alternative method was concluded to be the best out of the two. Nevertheless, it is important to test the experimental set-up with the proposed method first to be able to assess its efficiency. The simulation results found that the model is extremely friction dominated, a very important conclusion in this case. This might cause problems in studying this particular simulation case as it mostly relies on pressure control based on manipulations of the hydrostatic pressure component. Furthermore, the results showed that the effect of these manipulations was almost entirely masked by friction. A possible solution for this problem would be to move the <b>suction</b> <b>point</b> higher up in the well, which would reduce the height of the fluid column above. This fluid column was found to be the main contributor to the negative friction effect...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{recent research}} {{funded by the}} U. S. Department of Defense Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) intended to improve the cost-effectiveness of systems to protect building occupants from subsurface radon gas and volatile organic compound (VOC) vapors. Standard practice for sub-slab depressurization (SSD) uses a fan or blower to create a measurable vacuum below the building and has not changed in a few decades. ASTM E- 2121 - 13 specifies a minimum target vacuum of 6 to 9 Pascals (Pa) everywhere below the building floor slab, but this {{can be difficult to}} measure compared to baseline fluctuations (a signal-to-noise challenge). A key variable that is not usually measured is the permeability of the material below the floor. If granular fill is below the floor (as specified in most building codes), high flow velocities can be generated with small pressure gradients, which can protect occupants via sub-slab ventilation (SSV). Alternatively, if the floor is well sealed, the venting system may be able to capture all of the available mass of VOCs or radon at a modest flow rate, in which case mass flux might be the most important metric. Using vacuum as the only performance metric will often result in an over-designed system that is not energy efficient because it draws an excessive amount of conditioned indoor air across the floor slab for discharge above the roofline and requires excessive electricity to power fans or blowers. Research was conducted at a 64, 000 ft 2 (5, 950 m 2) commercial building with an existing SSD system comprised of 27 <b>suction</b> <b>points</b> connected to 9 fans to demonstrate and validate new methods and criteria for system optimization and monitoring, including transient and steady-state pneumatic testing and mathematical modeling using the Hantush-Jacob model, sub-slab tracer testing, building depressurization testing, trichloroethene (TCE) mass flux monitoring, and confirmatory indoor air sampling and analysis.

In the Northern Guinea Savanna (NGS) ecological zone of Nigeria, agricultural production is mainly constrained by low soil nutrient and water holding capacity, it is therefore, imperative to develop appropriate management practices that will give optimal soil hydro-physical properties for proper plant growth, effective soil and water management and environmental conservation. This study investigated the effect of three tillage practices (no till, reduced till and conventional till) and four cover crops (Centrosema pascuorum, Macrotyloma uniflorum, Cucurbita maxima and Glyine max) and a bare/control (no cover crop) on some soil physical properties of a Typic Haplusult during the rainy seasons of 2011, 2012 and 2013 in Samaru, NGS ecological zone of Nigeria.

Auger and core soil samples were collected {{at the end of each}} cropping season each year in three replicates from each treatment plot at four depths (0 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 15 and 15 - 20 cm). Particle size distribution, bulk density, total pore volume and water retention at various soil matric potentials were determined using standard methods. Data obtained were compared with optimum values and fitted into a RETC computer code for quantifying soil hydraulic behavior and physical quality. Results showed that different tillage practices had varied effect on soil physical properties. No-till had the highest water holding capacity at most <b>suction</b> <b>points</b> evaluated, it had 4. 3 % and 12. 9 % more soil moisture than the reduced till  and conventionally tilled systems across all matric potentials while Centrosema pascuorum (3. 1 %) and Cucurbita maxima (5. 5 %) were best among evaluated cover crops in retaining soil moisture content compared to the bare plots at - 33 kPa matric potential. Generally the Dexter S value used as an index for soil physical quality ranged within the limits of very good to good soil physical quality irrespective of the tillage practice, cover crops grown or depth of soil sampling. However the conventional tillage practice and soil under no cover crop had adverse effect on soil structural stability, placing them at a high risk of soil degradation.

Suction at the wilting point increases the soil matric suction and ground settlement, whereas the saturation permeability decreases the maximum soil matric suction generated.

40|$|Considerable {{efforts have}} been made in recent years to develop a better {{understanding}} of the mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils in terms of elastoplastic critical state constitutive models. These models are defined in terms of four independent stress state variables : mean net stress, deviator stress, suction and specific volume. An important feature of the models is the suggestion of the existence of a yield surface in mean net stress : deviator stress : suction space. Suction-controlled triaxial tests were performed to investigate the shape of the yield surface for unsaturated compacted speswhite kaolin with a particular stress history. The tests were conducted in a Bishop-Wesley triaxial cell with suction applied by the axis translation technique. The soil samples were instrumented with local strain gauges for measuring the sample volume change. Ten samples were tested, and in each test the location of the yield surface was fixed by isotropically consolidating the sample to a mean net stress of 400 kl'a and a suction of 100 kPa. This procedure effectively erased the one-dimensional stress history produced by the compaction process. After unloading to stress states inside the yield surface, samples were re-loaded either isotropically or by drained triaxial shearing. Re-loading stages were conducted at three different values of <b>suction.</b> Yield <b>points</b> in the re-loading stages were most easily identified from plots of specific volume against the logarithm of mean net stress (even for shear tests), whereas it was often difficult to identify a clear yield point from a plot of deviator stress against shear strain. The yield points identified from the re-reloading stages were used to define the shape of the yield surface in a stress space with axes of deviator stress, mean net stress and suction. Constant suction cross-sections of the yield surface were approximately elliptical in shape, with one axis of the ellipse coinciding with the mean net stress axis. As expected, the size of the elliptical constant suction yield curves increased with increasing suction Soil elastic indices obtained from swell-back and suction-change stages showed non-conservative behaviour, indicating that the behaviour of the soil was not truly elastic even for stress states inside the yield surface.

The tree roots provide three stabilising functions: (a) reinforcement of the soil, (b) dissipation of excess pore pressures and (c) establishing sufficient matric suction to increase the shear strength. The main focus {{of this research is}} to investigate the effects of vegetation on soil matric suction, ground settlement and lateral movement (radial consolidation). A mathematical model for the rate of root water uptake has been developed based on the root growth rate and considering ground conditions, type of vegetation and climatic parameters. The three independent features in the root water uptake model considered in detail are soil suction, root distribution, and potential transpiration. In order to establish a rigorous analysis for estimating the actual transpiration or root water uptake, the above mentioned factors have been quantified through relevant equations to develop the proposed root water uptake model. A two dimensional finite element approach based on ABAQUS has been employed to solve the transient coupled flow and deformation equations. The proposed root water uptake model has been implemented in the coupled analysis by introducing a sink term as a subroutine in the finite element analysis. The finite element mesh can be constructed using partially/fully saturated soil elements, representing the salient aspects of unsaturated permeability and the soil water characteristic curve. The model formulation is based on the general effective stress theory of unsaturated soils. Based on this proposed model, the distribution of the matric suction profile adjacent to the tree has been numerically analysed. To validate the model, an array of field measurements conducted at Miram site in Victoria, Australia and the data have been compared with the numerical predictions. The predicted results calculated using the soil, plant, and atmospheric parameters contained in the numerical model, compared favourably with the field and the associated laboratory measurements, justifying the assumptions upon which the model has been developed. The numerical analysis encompassing the developed root water uptake model can reasonably predict the region of maximum matric suction (away from the tree trunk axis), which has been consistent with the field measurements. Moreover, field measurements taken from the previously published literature have been compared with the numerical predictions. It is found that given the approximation of the assumed model parameters, the agreement between the predicted results and field data is still promising. The influence of different parameters on the maximum rate of root water uptake is investigated through parametric and sensitivity analyses. In addition, the rate of selected parameters such as potential transpiration and its distribution, <b>suction</b> at wilting <b>point,</b> the coefficient of permeability and the distribution of root length density have been studied in detail. The findings of this study confirm that four key parameters, including permeability, wilting <b>point</b> <b>suction,</b> density and distribution of the root length, and the rate of potential transpiration should be estimated or measured accurately in order to predict the behaviour of clayey soils near tree roots. The action of a single tree on improving the soil behaviour has been compared to a vertical drain with applied suction (vacuum pressure). It is seen that root water uptake and associated matric suction is analogous to a prefabricated vertical drain with vacuum preloading, and the lateral inward displacements simulate the radial consolidation process of prefabricated vertical drains. If a pattern of trees can be grown systematically along rail corridors, this may offer a cheaper and more environmentally attractive solution to vertical drains in the long-term. The results of this study provide a valuable and a relatively accurate mean to estimate the influences of vegetation on ground. The numerical model developed herein offers practicing geotechnical engineers an effective tool for designing structures on vadose zones containing vegetation. It is desirable to consider the influence zone of tree roots and the improved soil properties in modern geotechnical designs, benefiting from native vegetation...|$|R
40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} thermodynamic operating parameter {{goals for the}} steady state operation of the control dewar/solenoid system. Specifically, how the control dewar pressure control valve, PV- 3062 -H and the magnet flow control valve EVMF are operated to give the lowest possible temperature fluid at the solenoid magnet. The goals are: (1) For PV- 3062 -H - The process variable is the helium reservoir pressure, minimize the reservoir pressure, provide only enough pressure plus a little margin to ensure leads flow; and (2) For EVMF - The process variable is firstly a manual setpoint of flowrate as read by the flow venturi, FE 3253 -H, and secondly the reservoir liquid level, minimize the pressure drop thru the solenoid cooling tubes, provide at least enough flow to maintain reservoir level and stable operation of the magnet. The thermodynamic states for the fluid thru the system are shown on the Pressure versus Temperature graph. Lines of constant enthalpy are also shown. State A is shown as two phase liquid entering the inlet of the subcooler. The subcooler subcools the fluid to State B. State B to State C {{is caused by the}} pressure drop across EVMF. State C to D is the estimated pressure drop from the outlet of EVMF thru the solenoid cooling tubes and back up to the helium reservoir inlet. To give the coolest fluid in the cooling tubes, the two phase fluid in the reservoir should be at the lowest pressure (and thus temperature). This lowest pressure is limited by the required pressure for leads flow and if this does not dominate, the low pressure side pressure drop thru the refrigerator and <b>suction</b> pressure set <b>point.</b> My guess is the lead flow requirement will dominate. I suggest putting the PV- 3062 -H set point such that the lead flow control valves operate at about 80 % open. The second parameter that will give the coolest fluid in the cooling tubes is a minimized pressure drop thru the cooling tubes. This can be accomplished by providing a minimized flowrate, sufficient only to ensure that the reservoir level is full and some liquid fraction leaves the helium outlet tubing. D-Zero Engineering note, EN- 338, 'LHe Flow Regime/Pressure Drop for DO Solenoid at Steady State Conditions' shows that even though the gas fraction increases at lower flowrates, the pressure drop decreases. This goal is ideal, and assumes good cooling at the magnet. Real effects such hot spots or quench experience in the magnet may necessitate a higher flowrate. The current design flow rate from Toshiba is somewhere around 2. 5 gls which is very low. Experience with the accuracy of the venturi flowmeter, coil characteristics etc. and some conservativeness will help determine the optimum flowrate. I would venture a guess {{that it would be a}} minimum of 5 g/s. The philosophy that I have been taking with transfer line and valve sizing is such that our refrigerator system will have the ability to supply up to at least 20 g/s if required and necessary. Preferably we will be around 5 g/s...|$|R
40|$|Active {{and passive}} chest suction is a {{treatment}} method used in surgery. The {{purpose is to}} suck liquid, blood or air from the pleural cavity and the restitution effect, i. e. lung unfolding. This method is very efficient in treatment of pneumothorax, hemothorax and other pathologic states in the pleural cavity. Chest suction {{has been used for}} a long time, today particularly at surgery departments. Nursing care of patients with chest suction is very important and special, in the instance of nurse's poor knowledge complications may occur, but moreover the patient may be hurt. The thesis called "Differences in Nursing Care of Patients with Active and Passive Chest Suction" is divided into two parts, a theoretical one and an empiric one. The theoretical part describes the mechanism of the active and passive suction, the development of this treatment method, and the indications leading to it. The theoretical part also deals with the nursing care about a patient with chest suction systematically from the chest drain introduction to patient's recovery. Goal was to identify the principles and find out the differences in nursing care of patients with active and passive chest sucking. Three research questions were formulated to achieve the goals. Q 1 : What are the principles of nursing care of a patient with active chest suction? Q 2 : What are the principles of nursing care of a patient with passive chest suction? Q 3 : In what spheres do the theoretical knowledge and practical skills in the care of a patient with active and passive chest sucking differ? Qualitative research was applied to elaboration of this bachelor thesis. The technique of semi-structured interview was used for data collection. A categorization was performed based on the interviews. To improve quality of the results the research was accompanied by the method of involved observation, which either confirmed the findings from the interviews or added facts that the nursed had not mentioned in the interviews. The research was performed at departments where patients with the chest sucking occur. The research has shown that the nurses are aware of the principles of the care of patients with active and passive chest suction. The interviews revealed the principles of the nursing care that should be followed throughout hospitalisation of a patient with chest <b>suction.</b> The nurses <b>point</b> out the differences between the active and passive chest suction in the interviews. The specifics of the system of active and passive chest sucking itself were also identified. The research has also shown that the departments where it was performed often use the active chest suction system called Medela, which gives free movement to the patients and easy handling for both the patient and the staff. Another, not as widespread active suction, compact unit has the same advantages as the Medela system. The research has however shown that the nurses were not sufficiently informed on operation of the compact system and the patient care with the compact active suction unit. The bachelor thesis has brought findings of the care of patients with passive chest suction of conventional type. The principles of the care of patients with active sucking have been found not only for the conventional system, but also those of modern active sucking techniques. The basic differences in nursing care of patients with active and passive suction have also been found out. The nurses concentrate on the differences in the care in the system tightness inspection, water column determination and the differences in handling the systems. This bachelor thesis outlines the principles and differences in the care of patients with active and passive chest suction, the adherence to which is among others a condition of timely recovery of the patient and return to normal life. It will also be written a leaflet on the principles of the nursing care of patients with active and passive chest suction...|$|R
