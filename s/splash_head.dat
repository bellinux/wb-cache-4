30|$|Figure  2 a {{shows the}} {{complete}} setup {{used for the}} ammonium removal in which four parts can be distinguished. With a laboratory vacuum pump (4) (KNF Laboport, USA), air is drawn through the stripping and scrubbing part of the setup equipped with Vigreux columns (total length of 0.4  m, 0.032  m diameter), a commonly used laboratory fractionating column (1). The Vigreux columns provide in both parts an exchange surface between the gas and the liquid phase that pass in counter-current through the columns. The vacuum is regulated by a valve (2) and a cold finger (3) is used to protect the vacuum pump against the gas vapours formed. The supernatant (in the stripping part) and the sulphuric acid solution (in the scrubbing part) were introduced into three-necked flasks of 5 and 3 L, respectively. Both Vigreux columns were provided with a <b>splash</b> <b>head</b> to prevent the supernatant and sulphuric acid solution ending up in the scrubbing part and valve/cold finger, respectively, because of the air stream through the entire system.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} the breeze had freshened, and the boat, slanting more sharply, commenced {{to throw the}} spray all over her {{as she left the}} shelter of the woods behind. She met the short, <b>splashing</b> <b>head</b> sea with streaming bow, and the sliding froth crept farther and farther up her lee deck as she smashed through it. Then as the water found its way over the coaming and poured down into her, Stirling glanced at his companion.|$|R

60|$|The very resolve {{seemed to}} lend me {{strength}} and {{to revive the}} hope that lay moribund in my breast. And then, scarce was it taken, when the door again opened, and a man, who was <b>splashed</b> from <b>head</b> to foot with mud, in earnest of how hard he had ridden, was ushered in.|$|R
60|$|The aide-de-camp came in. He was <b>splashed</b> from <b>head</b> to foot in {{witness of}} the fury {{with which he}} had ridden, his hair was caked with dust and his face haggard. But he carried himself with soldierly uprightness, and his speech was brisk. He {{repeated}} what Tremayne had already stated, with some few additional details.|$|R
60|$|He turned, and {{presented}} to Lord Willoughby a formidable front. His head-piece was gone, his breastplate dinted, his right sleeve a rag {{hanging from his}} shoulder about a naked arm. He was <b>splashed</b> from <b>head</b> to foot with blood, and there was blood from a scalp-wound {{that he had taken}} matting his hair and mixing with the grime of powder on his face to render him unrecognizable.|$|R
60|$|<b>Splashed</b> from <b>head</b> to {{foot with}} mud, hatless, {{and with great}} streaks of blood clotted upon his {{forehead}} and cheeks, he presented at first a frightful figure. But his face had lost that dreadful expression of numbed horror which had made {{it for a moment}} so terrible to me, and, as he sank back breathless and exhausted, among the cushions, he even attempted a smile.|$|R
60|$|On {{the third}} day after my {{adventure}} in the park Mr. Ravenor called to see me. He came in <b>splashed</b> from <b>head</b> to foot and had evidently ridden a long distance and fast. I offered him a chair and some refreshment, for he looked pale and tired, but he declined both, and walked slowly {{up and down the}} room, his hands grasping a long riding-whip behind his back.|$|R
60|$|Sir Oliver {{found himself}} {{face to face}} with the white-bearded leader of the corsairs, who was leaning upon his scimitar and {{regarding}} him with eyes at once amused and amazed. Our gentleman's naked body was <b>splashed</b> from <b>head</b> to foot with blood, and in his right hand he still clutched that yard of iron links with which he had wrought such ghastly execution. Yusuf was standing at the corsair leader's elbow speaking rapidly.|$|R

60|$|A {{minute later}} came another yell from Lew Flapp. He and his tent-mates had tried {{in vain to}} hold down their canvas. Now it went up with a rush. One of the peg ropes caught around Flapp's leg and he was dragged over the wet ground, with his <b>head</b> <b>splashing</b> into every pool of water that he passed.|$|R
60|$|He was a {{tall man}} of rather slender stature, but indifferently dressed in {{garments}} that were <b>splashed</b> from <b>head</b> to foot with mud, and from which a steam was beginning to rise as he stood now {{with his back to}} the fire. Charlot eyed him so narrowly that the fellow shifted his position and dropped his glance in some discomfort. His speech, though rough of purport, had not been ungentle of delivery. But his face was dirty--the sure sign of an ardent patriot--his hair hung untidy about his face, and he wore that latest abomination of the ultra-revolutionist, a dense black beard and moustache.|$|R
50|$|On January 21, 2016, Halsey {{revealed}} the single's artwork via Twitter. The art {{had been painted}} {{on the side of}} a building located at the intersection of Franklin Street and Meserole Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The picture features a black human silhouette standing in front of a dark green background. Lilac paint <b>splashes</b> around the <b>head</b> of the figure, which is a reference to the song's bridge. Upon its release, MTV's contributor Madeline Roth compared the reveal to the advertising campaign preceding Justin Bieber's album Purpose.|$|R
60|$|Her {{eyes opened}} very wide at that, and wandered over {{me with a}} look that was passing eloquent. Indeed, I was a sorry {{spectacle}} for any woman's eyes--particularly a pretty one's. <b>Splashed</b> from <b>head</b> to foot with mud, my doublet saturated and my beaver dripping, with the feather hanging limp and broken, whilst there was a rent in my breeches {{that had been made}} by Canaples's sword, I take it that I had not the air of a courtier, and that when I said that I went to the Palais Royal she might have justly held me to be the adventurous lover of some kitchen wench. But unto the Palais Royal go others besides courtiers and lovers--spies of the Cardinal, for instance, and in her sudden coldness and the next question that fell from her beauteous lips I read that she had guessed me one of these.|$|R

Realizing it, the villain begins to plead him not to commit suicide and that he (hero) shouldn't kill himself because he has not done wrong and he shouldn't die.

At that moment the pony gave a sudden swerve; and I take it he must have been a bit too close. I heard a yell and a curse, and at the same instant I was <b>splashed</b> from <b>head</b> to foot with ditch water. Then the brute bolted. A man was coming along, asleep {{on the top of a}} cart-load of windsor chairs. It's disgraceful the way those wagoners go to sleep; I wonder there are not more accidents. I don't think he ever knew what had happened to him. I couldn't look round to see what became of him; I only saw him start. Half-way down the hill a policeman holla'd to me to stop. I heard him shouting out something about furious driving. Half-a-mile this side of Chesham we came upon a girls' school walking two and two--a 'crocodile' they call it, I think. I bet you those girls are still talking about it. It must have taken the old woman a good hour to collect them together again.|$|R
60|$|While {{he cut the}} plug, {{the silence}} was broken. There was a humming in the pine tops and light {{branches}} began to toss. The draught from the door got stronger, but did not bite as keenly, and {{it sounded as if}} the snow was falling from the trees. Then some slipped down the roof, and getting up with tingling nerves, he opened the door. All the trees were rustling and waves of sound came up the valley. The sound swelled, the air felt damp, and a drop of moisture from the roof <b>splashed</b> upon his <b>head.</b> He drew a deep breath of relief, for a warm wind from the Pacific was roaring through the defile. Then Festing dropped the newspaper.|$|R

If we were to gallop all the way we might do it in twelve hours. The roads in many places will be bad, and we must stop for meals at least three times; with the utmost speed we could hardly be in Paris in less than fifteen hours.

2500|$|Near {{the end of}} Sting's {{battles with}} the Dangerous Alliance, the seeds were sown for what became arguably {{one of the most}} famous feuds of Sting's career.

During the match, Vader splashed Sting, {{cracking}} three of Sting's ribs and rupturing his spleen. Sting recovered and defended his title on July 12 against Vader at The Great American Bash, dropping the belt to Big Van Vader after missing a Stinger <b>Splash,</b> hitting his <b>head</b> on the ringpost, and receiving a powerbomb.

60|$|She got on {{very well}} till {{she came to}} the bridge and stopped to look over the railing at the water running by so fast, and the turtles sunning {{themselves}} on the rocks. Lily was fond of throwing stones at them; it was so funny to watch them tumble, heels over <b>head,</b> <b>splash</b> into the water. Now, when she saw three big fellows close by, she stooped for a stone, and just at that minute a gale of wind nearly took the umbrella out of her hand. She clutched it fast; and away she went like a thistle-down, right up in the air, over river and hill, houses and trees, faster and faster, till her head spun round, her breath was all gone, and she had to let go. The dear red umbrella flew away like a leaf; and Lily fell down, down, till she went crash into a tree which grew in such a curious place that she forgot her fright as she sat looking about her, wondering what part of the world it could be.|$|R
60|$|Andrew {{stripped}} to shirt and overall trousers, and hurried toward the spot. He {{saw that the}} men needed help, for the cracked roof was bulging downward ominously and there were several heaps of freshly fallen stones. They were constructing a square frame of logs, crossed at the ends, and filling it in with broken rock {{as fast as they}} could; but there remained a wide gap between its top and the roof it was meant to support. For an hour he worked savagely, wet with falling water and dripping with perspiration, passing up heavy beams and stones to the men who laid them in place. He grew breathless and tore his hand, but the flakes of rock which fell at intervals urged him on. Once or twice there was a crash farther down the tunnel and he saw shadowy figures scatter and others run in with props, {{but for the most part}} he fixed his attention on his task, because it looked as if they had no time to lose. When a gush of water flowing down the <b>heading</b> <b>splashed</b> about his boots, he called Carnally.|$|R

500|$|Elliott was {{admitted}} to the 1st Australian General Hospital in Heliopolis on 7 May 1915, was discharged on 26 May, and rejoined the 7th Battalion at Anzac on 5 June. On 8 July he was in his headquarters behind Steele's Post when he received word that the Turks were in an Australian tunnel near the German Officers' Trench. Characteristically, he went forward in person to ascertain the situation, entering the tunnel with two men. Some [...] from the end there was a flash in his face, and the man behind him was shot. Elliott drew his pistol and barricaded the tunnel with sand bags, refusing help for fear that anyone else coming forward might also be hit. The tunnel was blocked off, and sealed with an explosion. On 8 August 1915, the 7th Battalion moved into positions captured the previous day in the Battle of Lone Pine, and he took over responsibility for the defence of the entire position. He led his men from the front trenches, steadying them in an uncertain situation. They fought off a series of Turkish counterattacks, winning four Victoria Crosses in the process. In the fighting, a man next to him was shot dead, <b>splashing</b> him from <b>head</b> to foot with blood and brains, but he was not decorated for the battle despite inspirational leadership. Apparently his name, originally {{at the top of the}} recommendations for decorations, had been struck off the list. On 28 August, Elliott was evacuated to England towards the end of August with pleurisy, and [...] did not rejoin the 7th Battalion until 7 November. On 18 December, one day before the evacuation of Anzac, he sprained his ankle and was evacuated ahead of his troops. He was mentioned in despatches on 28 January 1916.|$|R

His dress, his gait, [...] his accent, {{the manner in which}} he gazed at the shops, stumbled [...] into gutters, ran against the porters, and stood under the [...] waterspouts, marked him out as an excellent subject for the [...] operations of swindlers and banterers.

Money-droppers, sore from the cart's [...] tail, introduced themselves to him, and appeared to him the [...] most honest friendly gentlemen that he had ever seen. Painted [...] women, the refuse of Lewkner Lane and Whetstone Park, passed [...] themselves on him for countesses and maids of honour. If he [...] asked his way to St. James', his informants sent him to Mile [...] End. If he went into a shop, he was instantly discerned to be [...] a fit purchaser of everything that nobody else would buy, of [...] second-hand embroidery, copper rings, and watches that would [...] not go.

60|$|When the {{shooting}} season commenced, however, a great change came over him, for {{he threw himself}} into the sport with an ardour that astonished his father. At last he really seemed to have found something worth caring for, and in a short time, by his devotion for field sports, he rose many degrees in the estimation of the young squires, who agreed that Gerald Harmer had turned out a capital fellow after all, {{in spite of his}} airs and nonsense. It is probable that he sank in the sisters' estimation as he rose in the brothers', for he now no longer cared for female society, and spent the whole of his time either in shooting over his own or other estates, with parties of their young owners, or sometimes alone, with no other companion than Long William, the keeper--or else in hunting, to which also he took with great ardour. His sporting tastes rapidly developed; dogs, horses, and guns occupied his whole thoughts; and few would have recognized in the figure in shooting-jacket and gaiters, returning <b>splashed</b> to the <b>head,</b> after a hard day's work, the indolent lounger who had considered it almost too great a trouble to think for himself. His father observed this change with pleasure, as he had noticed with pain his son's increasing listlessness, although he was personally a loser by it; for Gerald had been hitherto his constant companion in his walks over his estate, and his visits of kindness at his labourers' cottages, which, under his care, assumed a very different and far more comfortable aspect than that which they had worn under the old régime. Still, he felt that it might do him much good; he thought it natural that the young man should be fond of sport, and should seek the companionship of men of his own age; and though he missed the former familiar intercourse with his son, he assented with a little sigh of regret to the new state of things, and told himself that it was much better so, and was very right and proper. Even of an evening it was seldom now that Gerald accompanied his father to the houses of the neighbouring gentry, always pleading fatigue, or some other excuse, for not doing so. On these occasions, when his father had started alone, he would be sure to find some pretext, some forgotten order, or question which must be asked, as a reason for strolling down {{in the course of the}} evening to smoke a pipe with his inseparable ally, Long William, the keeper.|$|R
