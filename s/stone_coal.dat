In {{addition}} to wharves for general goods, some specifically handled timber, chalk, <b>stone,</b> <b>coal,</b> or wheat. Several of the factories and mills had private wharves. By this date, a dock had been built near Bow Bridge to the south of the High Street. It was about , and was connected to the river by its own channel. It was initially called Stratford Dock, later becoming Meggs Dock and was probably constructed by the Middlesex and Essex Turnpike Trust.

The first mill in the current boundaries of Northumberland County was built {{on or near the}} creek in 1774. A road up the creek's valley was being laid out by 1775. The first coal in Shamokin was discovered in Shamokin Creek at what is now Spurzheim Street and Clay Street. Before the War of 1812, Abraham Cherry constructed a sawmill on Shamokin Creek. Some coal mining was being done at the creek by 1825. A dam was constructed on the creek in Shamokin in 1826 and John C. Byrd opened a <b>stone</b> <b>coal</b> quarry on the creek in the same year. The only canal boat on Shamokin Creek was launched in the early 1830s.|$|E
