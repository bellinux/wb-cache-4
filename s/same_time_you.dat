He began seeing more and more scripts, writing scripts and developed the urge to direct. Hill:Seeing so many of the European films, Japanese films, I was part of this isolated community in east Hollywood. I remembered thinking just a little further west they are making the films I want to see. I'm going to do this. Sink or swim... I wanted to be a writer on my way to being a director. Directors were already my heroes. Kurosawa, number of Italian directors... Movies from England, France, Sweden, Italy. Poland... One wanted a chance to tell stories in an open, loose, not constricted Hollywood kind of way. At the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> wanted to work in Hollywood... I was tremendously interested in genre films. Wanted to work within genre films.|$|E
500|$|David Julyan {{composed}} the film's synthesized score. Julyan acknowledges several synthesized soundtracks that inspired him, such as Vangelis's Blade Runner and Hans Zimmer's The Thin Red Line. While composing the score, Julyan created different, distinct sounds {{to differentiate between}} the color and black-and-white scenes: [...] "brooding and classical" [...] themes in the former, and [...] "oppressive and rumbly noise" [...] in the latter. Since he describes the entire score as [...] "Leonard's theme", Julyan says, [...] "The emotion I was aiming at with my music was yearning and loss. But {{a sense of loss}} you feel but at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> don't know what it is you have lost, a sense of being adrift." [...] Initially, Nolan wanted to use Radiohead's [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] during the end credits, but he was unable to secure the rights. Instead, David Bowie's [...] "Something in the Air" [...] is used, although another of Radiohead's songs, an extended version of [...] "Treefingers", is included on the film's soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|Zaillian {{discussed}} many of {{the themes}} in Larsson's Millennium series with Fincher, taking the pair deeper into the novel's darker subjects, such as the psychological dissimilarities between rapists and murderers. Fincher {{was familiar with the}} concept, from projects such as Seven (1995) and Zodiac (2007). Zaillian commented, [...] "A rapist, or at least our rapist, is about exercising his power over somebody. A serial killer is about destruction; they get off on destroying something. It's not about having power over something, it's about eliminating it. What thrills them is slightly different." [...] The duo wanted to expose the novels' pivotal themes, particularly misogyny. [...] "We were committed to the tack that this is a movie about violence against women about specific kinds of degradation, and you can't shy away from that. But at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> have to walk a razor thin line so that the audience can viscerally feel the need for revenge but also see the power of the ideas being expressed." [...] Instead of the typical three-act structure, they reluctantly chose a five-act structure, which Fincher pointed out is [...] "very similar to a lot of TV cop dramas." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to stylistic touches, the episode established several narrative motifs that stayed with Homicide: Life on the Street throughout {{the duration of}} the series. Among them was the white board where detectives kept the names of their open cases in red and their closed cases in black. The names of NBC employees and friends of the Homicide crew were used on the white board. The episode was noted for its deliberate lack of gunplay and car chases in favor of dialogue and story. Levinson and Fontana also allowed humor to be incorporated into the show, particularly through the interactions between the detectives; Levinson said of the first episode, [...] "We have to inform the audience, but at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> want to do it {{with a sense of humor}} so you don't seem too pretentious, in a way." [...] Several long-standing character traits were established in [...] "Gone for Goode", including Kay Howard's extraordinary streak of solved cases and the antagonism between Felton and Pembleton, which is demonstrated when the two argue loudly after being assigned to a case together. The animosity between Felton and Pembleton is based on the real-life Detective Donald Kincaid, who was the inspiration behind Felton, and the strong dislike Kincaid had for Harry Edgerton, as chronicled in Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. Howard's perfect streak is based on a similar (although shorter) lucky streak experienced by the real-life Detective Rich Garvey, who is also featured in David Simon's book.|$|E
500|$|Lionel {{also has}} a key {{relationship}} with Martha Kent, Clark Kent's adoptive mother. This relationship first develops in season two when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant; it is further developed in season five. Glover felt Lionel's attraction to Martha grows in season five when Jonathan Kent dies because he now sees Martha as a single woman and is now more attainable; Glover believes Lionel was seeking to attain Martha's [...] "goodness" [...] and the attraction {{is not based on}} lust. When Lionel is in Martha's company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior. Writer Holly Harold said his relationship with Martha parallels Lex's relationship with Lana; both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side. Annette O'Toole said Martha's interest in Lionel is like watching a dangerous animal; [...] "It's that attraction you have for a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, but at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] O'Toole also said she believes Martha's motivation is to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When Martha left the show, writer Todd Slavkin said they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on screen. Slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave John Schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in. The writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage. O'Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a small attraction to Lionel and that nothing serious would come from it.|$|E

500|$|O'Toole {{relished the}} {{opportunity}} {{that came with}} Jonathan's passing, {{even though she was}} saddened to see a friend leave the show. Martha taking the senate seat was a chance to explore more adult stories with her character beginning midway through season five, which was important for the actress since Clark was becoming an adult on the show. It also allowed for O'Toole the chance to depict [...] "strong emotions" [...] over Jonathan's death. Al Gough feels that Jonathan's passing allowed for them to explore more of Martha's smart and strong side, as well as her relationship with Lionel. The idea was to show that there was some form of attraction between Martha and Lionel, but that Martha would never have any romantic relationship with the billionaire, especially after all that he had done to her family. O'Toole likens Martha's interest in Lionel with that of watching a dangerous animal: [...] "It's that attraction you have for a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, but at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] The actress believes that Martha's ultimate motivation was to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When it came time for Martha to leave the show, writer Todd Slavkin contends that they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on film. Slavkin explains that they could not do anything equivalent to what they gave John Schneider, as there were already so many storylines going on by the season six finale that they could not fit anything else in. The writers also realized that they could not kill off the character, and so chose to send her to the US Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with SFX producer Phil Collinson stated that after the Doctor regenerates the [...] "initial dynamic changes because [...] has to learn to trust him again". Piper added that as the Doctor is incapacitated Rose consequently feels [...] "unloved", [...] "isolated" [...] and [...] "like she's lost her best friend". In the Doctor's absence Rose relies on her observations of him and tries to mimic his actions. Collinson {{felt it was important}} to resolve any mistrust between the pair {{by the end of the}} Christmas Special, as the public had responded well to Rose and the Doctor's friendship previously. Davies had scripted dialogue in [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] explaining the newly regenerated Doctor's estuary English accent by stating he had imprinted on Rose and adopted her way of speaking. However, due to time constraints this sequence was not filmed. Discussing how Rose had developed by the second series, Piper described her as having [...] "come on in leaps and bounds" [...] and stated she is now [...] "a lot more proactive." [...] She felt that there is a [...] "different kind of energy" [...] between Rose and the Tenth Doctor, whilst Tennant remarked that the audience would get to see the Doctor-companion relationship [...] "developing and becoming something that it maybe hasn't before." [...] Piper stated that with the Tenth Doctor, Rose is [...] "more tetchy and more possessive" [...] over him as [...] "she feels like she's lost him once and doesn't want to lose him again". She cited Rose's [...] "catfight" [...] with former companion Sarah Jane Smith in [...] "School Reunion" [...] as evidence of this. Discussing the possibility of Rose and the Tenth Doctor becoming more romantically involved Piper stated [...] "You want it to happen, but at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> don't want it to happen". Tennant likened the dynamic between the pair to that of Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in The X-Files. Both Tennant and Piper agreed that the expectation of the relationship is more exciting than having it realised. To add to the tragedy of their separation, Davies scripted the series two story arc so that Rose and the Doctor would be indirectly responsible for their separation. [...] "It's deliberate when that happens [...] ", said Davies, [...] "and they do pay the price. In [...] "Tooth and Claw", they set up the very thing— Torchwood— that separates them in the end. It's sort of their own fault." [...] Though Davies left the Doctor's response to Rose's declaration of love in [...] "Doomsday" [...] unstated, Gardner felt strongly that the character reciprocated her feelings. On the commentary for the episode she stated that she would [...] "confirm to the world" [...] that he was going to [...] "say it back." ...|$|E
500|$|Released to {{positive}} reviews, with aggregated scores of 87/100 on Metacritic and 88.7% on GameRankings, some journalists considered Super Monkey Ball {{the highlight of}} the GameCube's launch lineup. The staff of Edge praised the main game as [...] "absorb" [...] due to its high level of difficulty, noting that the trial and error required to complete challenging levels forces one to learn the nuances of its [...] "reductive control system" [...] and eventually enables the player to perform seemingly impossible tasks with increasing ease: [...] "Once a level falls, the mysticism around it vanishes. It's beatable; it's an afterthought on the route to your next impossible hurdle." [...] Writing for GameSpy, Ben Turner commented on the [...] "excellent progression of difficulty" [...] engendered by three distinct difficulty modes and thoughtful stage design, expounding [...] "most levels introduce some new idea or concept to the game" [...] and [...] "every single level played adds to your skill." [...] IGN's Matt Casamassina commended the [...] "great level variation", with [...] "well created mazes and puzzles that must be completed using a combination of physics calculations, careful planning and a huge helping of patience." [...] Turner complimented the frequent introduction of incentives to keep playing such as additional continues and hidden levels, adding that a high [...] "ceiling of mastery" [...] enhanced the game's longevity through a [...] "simple but well conceived" [...] scoring system and the ability to test strategies in practice mode. Edge and Casamassina thought similarly, with the latter stating [...] "there are shortcuts that can be carved out by the crafty player, physics to be considered when navigating and more." [...] N-Sider's Tim Knowles pointed out that [...] "the latter levels in the game get extremely difficult and you will often get frustrated", while Casamassina felt [...] "it may be a little too difficult for the casual gamer." [...] However, N-Sider's Mark Medina called the learning curve [...] "perfectly spot on": [...] "Any falling off the platforms feels entirely your fault and at the <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> always get the sense that you're just that little bit closer to that elusive goal." [...] Edge and N-Sider's Jason Nuyens and Will Stevenson agreed with this sentiment, with the latter emphasizing the addictive quality of the gameplay. On a technical note, GamePros Four-Eyed Dragon faulted the camera system, which [...] "can get out of position, making it hard to maneuver in tight spots." [...] In The Japan Times, Steven L. Kent described the game as [...] "a test of nerve" [...] requiring [...] "advanced eye–hand coordination." [...] Turner reflected on the game's ability to evoke feelings of [...] "nervous excitement", [...] "intensity", and [...] "electrifying, stomach-wrenching fear": [...] "It's a thrilling feeling to be winding down a paper-thin path with ten seconds on the clock, hoping against hope that you can keep your balance for just a few more seconds and make it to the goal before time expires." [...] Edge opined that the game is [...] "defined" [...] by [...] "unrefined and angular" [...] emotions: ...|$|E

2500|$|Fifty {{to sixty}} actresses auditioned {{for the role}} of Anna. Baccarin was {{initially}} rejected following her audition, as Peters did not believe she had the right look for the role.

Baccarin has said of her role: [...] "being, I guess, the face of what people want to see... I think there's an aspect of politicians: You need to embody what everybody wants to see, and at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> have your own agenda." [...] Laura Vandervoort plays the Visitor Lisa. Vandervoort is unaware of Lisa's ultimate agenda, which she believes makes the creative process more exciting.

He believes that his work can have more impact when directed at his own government, and that he holds a responsibility {{as a member of a}} particular country of origin to work to stop that country from committing crimes.

2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so I {{had no choice but to}} submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that I had no choice but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. That was when I decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> can assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. You can bring along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death.
