5|$|Sharia (or Islamic law), {{the primary}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> in modern Saudi Arabia, was {{developed}} gradually by Muslim judges and scholars between {{the seventh and}} tenth centuries. From {{the time of the}} Abbasid caliphate in the 8th century, the developing Sharia was accepted as the basis of law in the towns of the Muslim world, including the Arabian peninsula, and upheld by local rulers, eclipsing urf (or pre-Islamic local customary law). In the rural areas, urf continued to be predominant for some time, and, for instance, was the main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> among the bedouin of Nejd in central Arabia until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, {{judgments}} handed down by the courts are considered a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E
5|$|Royal decrees (nizam) are {{the other}} main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> but are {{referred}} to as regulations rather than laws to indicate that they are subordinate to the Sharia. Royal decrees supplement Sharia in areas such as labor, commercial and corporate law. Additionally, other forms of regulations (lai'hah) include Royal Orders, Council of Ministers Resolutions, Ministerial Resolutions and, Ministerial Circulars, and are similarly subordinate to Sharia.|$|E
40|$|International audienceToday, {{researchers}} {{studying the}} <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> have two challenges facing them. First, they must study the material <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> Indeed, these material <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> are traditionally left out, {{although they are}} very important {{and more and more}} original works can be carried on them. Second, they must rethink the formal <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> As more and more new types of norms and new types <b>of</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> norms born, researchers have to take them seriously. Therefore, this study invites to advance research on the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> so that it does not become archaic and adapts to changes in the world <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> Research on the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> such as research on law in general, must be dynamic and pragmatic...|$|R

5|$|Justification {{for using}} the Sunnah as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> {{can be found in}} the Qur'an. The Qur'an {{commands}} Muslims to follow Muhammad. During his lifetime, Muhammad made it clear that his traditions (along with the Qur'an) should be followed after his death. The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and clarifications of the Qur'an. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Qur'an contains many rules for the behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur'anic rules on many religious and practical matters. Muslims believe that they can look at the way of life, or sunnah, of Muhammad and his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal system}} of Saudi Arabia {{is based on}} Sharia, Islamic law derived from the Qur'an and the Sunnah (the traditions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The sources of Sharia also include Islamic {{scholarly}} consensus developed after Muhammad's death. Its interpretation by judges in Saudi Arabia {{is influenced by the}} medieval (Islamic Golden Age) texts of the literalist Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence. Uniquely in the Muslim world, Sharia has been adopted by Saudi Arabia in an uncodified form. This, and the lack of judicial precedent, has resulted in considerable uncertainty in the scope and content of the country's laws. The government therefore announced its intention to codify Sharia in 2010, but this is yet to be implemented. Sharia has also been supplemented by regulations issued by royal decree covering modern issues such as intellectual property and corporate law. Nevertheless, Sharia remains the primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> especially in areas such as criminal, family, commercial and contract law, and the Qur'an and the Sunnah are declared to be the country's constitution. In the areas of land and energy law the extensive proprietorial rights of the Saudi state (in effect, the Saudi royal family) constitute a significant feature.|$|E
25|$|The primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> in Saudi Arabia {{is based}} on Sharia (Islamic law), with Shari'a courts basing their {{judgments}} largely on a code derived from the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Additionally, traditional tribal law and custom remain significant.|$|E

25|$|The primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> is the Islamic Sharia {{derived from}} {{the teachings of the}} Qur'an and the Sunnah (the traditions of the Prophet).

Saudi judges tend to follow the principles of the Hanbali school of jurisprudence (or fiqh) found in pre-modern texts and noted for its literalist interpretation of the Qur'an and hadith.|$|E

25|$|Most Muslim-majority {{countries}} incorporate sharia at {{some level}} in their legal framework, with many calling it the highest law or the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> {{of the land in}} their constitution. Most use sharia for personal law (marriage, divorce, domestic violence, child support, family law, inheritance and such matters). Elements of sharia are present, to varying extents, {{in the criminal justice system}} of many Muslim-majority countries. Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Brunei, Qatar, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Sudan and Mauritania apply the code predominantly or entirely while it applies in some parts of Indonesia.|$|E

25|$|In {{order for}} custom {{to become a}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> it must be {{approved}} by the competent legislator. Custom in canon law is not simply created by the people through their constant performance of a certain act, but it is the constant performance of a certain act, with the intention of making a custom, which is approved by the competent legislator, thereby acquiring the force of law. This is because of the Catholic ecclesiological teaching on the constitution of the Catholic Church, which states that Christ constituted the Church by divine delegation of power to the hierarchical authorities; the Church was not created by the consent of the governed, but by the direct will of Christ.|$|E
25|$|By the 17th Century, the Medieval teleological view {{came under}} intense {{criticism}} from some quarters. Thomas Hobbes instead founded a contractualist theory of legal positivism on what all men could agree upon: what they sought (happiness) {{was subject to}} contention, but a broad consensus could form around what they feared (violent death {{at the hands of}} another). The natural law was how a rational human being, seeking to survive and prosper, would act. Natural law, therefore, was discovered by considering humankind's natural rights, whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law. In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign. Because the ultimate <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> now comes from the sovereign, and the sovereign's decisions need not be grounded in morality, legal positivism is born. Jeremy Bentham's modifications on legal positivism further developed the theory.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{theory of}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} elaborates how scriptures {{should be interpreted}} {{from the standpoint of}} linguistics and rhetoric. It also comprises methods for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the legal force of a scriptural passage is abrogated by a passage revealed at a later date. In addition to the Quran and sunnah, the classical theory of Sunni fiqh recognizes two other sources of law: juristic consensus (ijmaʿ) and analogical reasoning (qiyas). It therefore studies the application and limits of analogy, as well as the value and limits of consensus, along with other methodological principles, some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools. This interpretive apparatus is brought together under the rubric of ijtihad, which refers to a jurist's exertion in an attempt to arrive at a ruling on a particular question. The theory of Twelver Shia jurisprudence parallels that of Sunni schools with some differences, such as recognition of reason (ʿaql) as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> in place of qiyas and extension of the notion of sunnah to include traditions of the imams.|$|E

25|$|Kant opens section III by {{defining}} the will {{as the cause}} of our actions. According to Kant, having a will is the same thing as being rational, and having a free will means having a will that is not influenced by external forces. This is a negative definition of freedom – it tells us that freedom is freedom from determination by alien forces. But Kant also provides a positive definition of freedom: a free will, Kant argues, gives itself a law- it sets its own ends, and has a special causal power to bring them about. A free will is one that has the power to bring about its own actions {{in a way that is}} distinct from the way that normal laws of nature cause things to happen. According to Kant, we need laws to be able to act. An action not based on some sort of law would be arbitrary and not the sort of thing that we could call the result of willing. Because a free will is not merely pushed around by external forces, external forces do not provide laws for a free will. The only <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> for a free will is that will itself. This is Kant's notion of autonomy. Thus, Kant's notion of freedom of the will requires that we are morally self legislating, that we impose the moral law on ourselves. Kant thinks that the positive understanding of freedom amounts to the same thing as the categorical imperative, and that “a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same”. This is the key notion that later scholars call the reciprocity thesis. The reciprocity thesis states that a will is bound by the moral law if and only if it is free. That means that if you know that someone is free, then you know that the moral law applies to them, and vice versa.|$|E
500|$|In law, {{a custom}} is an {{established}} practice or behaviour {{that is considered}} to be law by the persons engaged in it. Customs do not have the force of law unless recognized in a case.

In Singapore, custom is a minor <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> as not many customs have been given judicial recognition.|$|E
500|$|The primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> in Saudi Arabia is the Islamic Sharia. Sharia {{is derived}} from the Qur'an and the traditions of Muhammad {{contained}} in the Sunnah; [...] ijma, or scholarly consensus on the meaning of the Qur'an and the Sunnah developed after Muhammad's death; and Qiyas, or analogical reasoning applied to the principles of the Qur'an, Sunnah and ijma. The Wahhabi interpretation of Islam used in Saudi Arabia uses qiyas only in cases of [...] "extreme necessity".|$|E
50|$|On the {{question}} <b>of</b> preference between <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> international <b>law,</b> rules established by treaty will take preference if such an instrument exists. It is also argued however that international treaties and international custom are <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> international <b>law</b> <b>of</b> equal validity; {{this is that}} new custom may supersede older treaties and new treaties may override older custom. Also, is cogens (peremptory norm) is a custom, not a treaty.
