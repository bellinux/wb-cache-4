Of national importance are the populations of the slowworm, viviparous lizard, smooth snake and common European viper. The amphibians are represented with 11 species, with highest diversity in the wet deciduous forests and the forest streams. Rila Monastery Forest Reserve is the most important area for amphibians conservation. Three species have a population of national importance: the Alpine newt, yellow-bellied toad and common frog.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spur-thighed</b> <b>tortoises</b> are {{commonly}} traded as pets, despite the illegality of this trade.

50|$|On Sardinia, a {{population}} of <b>spur-thighed</b> <b>tortoises</b> shares the small size, the yellow head spot, and the contrasting markings with the Tunisian population. Their taxonomic status is enigmatic, as is their very existence on the island, separated from North Africa by a considerable stretch of the Mediterranean which tortoises are hardly able to cross. There is a distinct local form of the marginated tortoise on the island, however, {{and that seems to}} have originated from a deliberate introduction by humans, perhaps by Greek or Roman landowners in the classical antiquity. While the local marginated tortoises show evidence of pronounced genetic drift and may thus justifiably regarded as a subspecies despite the absence of lineage sorting, the <b>spur-thighed</b> <b>tortoises</b> of Sardinia are probably best considered an introduced population not yet worthy of taxonomic separation pending further research.|$|R

40|$|Reproduction {{in female}} <b>spur-thighed</b> <b>tortoises</b> (Testudo graeca) in a {{population}} from southwestern Spain was studied by X-radiography of thread-trailed and radio-tagged individuals. Most females reproduce every year, laying one to four clutches from April to June with internesting intervals ranging from 21 to 29 days. Clutch size varied from 1 to 7 eggs and averaged 3. 5 eggs. Carapace length and mass of females were positively correlated with the starting date and duration of the nesting season, while age was not correlated with any reproductive variable. Eggs averaged 33. 87 Ã— 27. 97 mm in dimensions and 14. 4 g in mass. Female mobility increased shortly before or after nesting, which resulted in wide dispersal of the various nests laid by an individual female. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Activity, mobility, growth rates, {{and space}} use of 48 {{hatchling}} <b>spur-thighed</b> <b>tortoises.</b> Testudo graeca, were monitored {{over a period}} of 8 months, from emergence from the nest in September until May. Individuals were followed by means of thread trailing and radio tracking. Overall average distance moved was 4. 42 m/day and average home-range size was 13. 7 m 2. Hatchlings were active from emergence until mid-December, exhibited discontinuous hibernation until mid-February, and reached highest activity and mobility values in April-May. Overall. mobility varied significantly with daily solar radiation values and maximum temperature, and was significantly dependent on body condition in winter. Body size and mass had no influence on individual performance, and a significant proportion of variance among individuals remained unexplained. Little growth occurred in autumn and body condition decreased steadily, increasing only from February onwards. Growth rates increased in March-April. No individual differences in growth rates were detected, initial body size being the main determinant of body size after 8 months. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Reptiles {{have very}} {{flexible}} growth rates, depending on living conditions - in particular dietary resources. Here, I demonstrate {{a difference in}} the growth rates of captive specimens, as compared to literature data for free-ranging ones, in Leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis), African spurred tortoises (G. sulcata), Hermannâ€™s tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and <b>Spur-thighed</b> <b>tortoises</b> (T. graeca). Such high growth rates are traditionally thought to be linked to health problems. In the case of the G. sulcata dataset (spanning 18 years for the captive individuals), it could be shown that fast growth leads to a fast reproductive maturity, as expected from inflexion points of growth curves. In a retrospective evaluation of 539 tortoise patients of the University of Zurich, no evidence for diet- or growth-related disease risk was found in animals that were particularly heavy for their age. However, typical diet- or growth-related disorders were more frequent among younger patients, suggesting that animals with such problems do not often survive to older age. Raising tortoises on intensive feeding regimes in captivity may considerably shorten generation times during the breeding stage of restocking programmes. Whether fast growth presents a health risk needs to be evaluated in controlled studies. The observations also suggest that feeding regimes in captivity â€“ even of appropriate diets - should be restricted if replication of conditions in the wild is a husbandry objective...|$|R

50|$|Treatment as a {{distinct}} subspecies is also not supported by mtDNA 12S rRNA haplotype analysis. However, these results still seem {{to confirm that the}} Tunisian <b>spur-thighed</b> <b>tortoise</b> constitutes a well-marked lineage of spur-thighed tortoises. The T. graeca complex is likely to be split into (at least) three species in the near future; the eastern Maghreb populations would remain in T. graeca in this case. Consequently, the scientific name that agrees best with the collected evidence would presently be T. graeca nabeulensis. As said above, however, apart from the Balkans and Eastern populations of the T. graeca complex, the present taxon seems to be quite distinct, too. As the former two lineages will eventually come to represent good species, the Tunisian <b>spur-thighed</b> <b>tortoise</b> might also be regarded as specifically distinct.|$|E
50|$|The Tunisian <b>spur-thighed</b> <b>tortoise</b> is a {{relatively}} small tortoise. The adult males usually have carapaces that seldom exceed 13 cm (about 4.5 in), whilst the adult females' carapaces {{are no more than}} 16.5 cm (some 6.5 in) long.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the dynamics of}} a population of <b>spur-thighed</b> <b>tortoises,</b> Testudo graeca, placed under long-term protection from human interference. We estimated demographic parameters and constructed vertical life tables based on age structures for two different study periods separated by a 12 -yr interval. Average age at maturity was 6. 9 yr for males and 8. 5 yr for females. Clutch size varied with female size, but tended to be constant among years. Average annual female fecundity over 9 yr was 8. 4 eggs and decreased significantly in years of high rainfall. Females seemed to reproduce yearly, but with a constantly low output, probably maximising both their long-term reproductive potential and the probability of producing offspring during favourable years for hatchling survival. Adult survival was high and constant between periods. Juvenile survivorship from egg to 6 yr and recruitment into the 5 - 8 -yr-old cohorts were significantly higher in the second period. Life tables indicated a predominantly negative demographic trend for the first period, with an average population increase rate of 0. 977, and an overall positive tendency for the second period, with an average increase rate of 1. 091. These figures suggest that the population experienced a variation that was closer to the maximum estimates for the first period, mediated mainly {{by an increase in}} juvenile recruitment. The data indicate that, besides high adult survival rates, occasional high juvenile recruitment bouts may have an important regulatory effect on the population dynamics of Testudo graeca.

40|$|<b>Spur-thighed</b> <b>tortoises,</b> Testudo graeca, in {{south-western}} Spain lay 3 - 4 clutches {{in shallow}} nests from April to June. In {{the present study}} the incubation temperature of nests laid in field enclosures in April, May and June was monitored over four years. Mean daily temperature throughout incubation averaged 27. 9 Â°C, but displayed a wide daily range, with average maximum values around 41 Â°C (also in nests where hatching success was > 0), and an absolute maximum of almost 50 Â°C. Early (April) nests displayed lower mean daily temperatures than intermediate (May) and late (June) nests, although all nests reached similar high temperatures during the hottest month (July). Incubation temperatures were affected by nest vegetation cover. Incubation length varied from 67 - 129 days. Because the length of incubation was negatively correlated with nest temperature, early nests had longer incubation periods than intermediate and late nests. Hatching success averaged 61 % and was mainly affected by variables related to maximum temperatures. Thus unsuccessful nests (i. e. no eggs hatching) were associated with higher temperatures or longer exposure to higher temperatures. Differences in hatching or nest success were {{not related to the}} nesting month, but might have been influenced by the location of the nest. Lethal temperatures for embryo development were frequently reached during July, therefore vegetation cover of the nest is likely {{to play an important role}} in avoiding deleterious nest environments.

40|$|Abstract Background Hyalomma aegyptium is a hard-tick with {{a typical}} three-host life cycle. The main hosts are Palearctic {{tortoises}} of genus Testudo. However, other hosts {{can be used}} by immature ticks for feeding in natural conditions. Given this complex ecology and multiple host use, the circulation of pathogens by H. aegyptium between various hosts can be important from epidemiological point of view. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the role of H. aegyptium as natural carrier of four important zoonotic pathogens. Methods From 2008 to 2011, 448 H. aegyptium ticks were collected from 45 <b>Spur-thighed</b> <b>tortoises,</b> Testudo graeca in Romania. DNA was extracted individually from each tick using a commercial kit. DNA was examined for the presence of specific sequences of Borrelia burgdorferi s. l., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia canis and Coxiella burnetii by PCR, according to previously described protocols. Results PCR analysis of H. aegyptium revealed the presence of A. phagocytophilum (18. 8 %), E. canis (14. 1 %) and C. burnetii (10 %). 32. 4 % of the ticks were infected with at least one pathogen and 9. 8 % had co-infections. The stages most frequently infected were nymphs (50 %) followed by males (33. 9 %) and females (27 %). The number of tortoises which harboured infected ticks was 27 / 45 examined (60 %). From all tested T. graeca, 40 % harboured ticks infected with A. phagocytophilum, 46. 7 % had ticks infected with E. canis and 33. 3 % had ticks with C. burnetii. This study reports for the first time the presence of A. phagocytophilum and E. canis in H. aegyptium. Conclusions The presence and relatively high prevalence of three important zoonotic pathogens in H. aegyptium raises the question of their epidemiologic importance in disease ecology. As tortoises are unlikely to be reservoir hosts for A. phagocytophilum and E. canis and both these pathogens are common in H. aegyptium, this is an important indication for (1) a possible increased host-switching behaviour of these ticks to competent reservoir hosts (i. e. hedgehogs) and (2) transstadial transmission. Furthermore, if we consider also the presence of C. burnetii, we conclude that T. graeca and its ticks should be evaluated more seriously when assessing the eco-epidemiology of zoonotic diseases. </p...|$|R
