5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads.

5|$|Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is {{considered}} superior to phototherapy because {{it produces a}} longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak. When treatment first begins, the main goal is {{to build up the}} patient's tolerance to UVA radiation enough <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be outdoors without suffering an episode of solar urticaria. Therefore, treatments are regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the patient has reached an adequate level of desensitization, treatments are reduced to once or twice per week.|$|E

Azazel had come into Sam's nursery and fed him his blood, with Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) walking in and recognizing the demon.|$|E

Canadians in the United States constitute the greatest single expatriate community at over 1 million in 2009, representing 35.8% of all Canadians abroad.

5|$|Cockatoos {{have a large}} bill, {{which is}} kept sharp by rasping the two mandibles {{together}} when resting. The bill is complemented by a large muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the lower mandible applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in place and the upper mandible acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the mandibles sideways. The bills of male cockatoos are generally slightly larger than those of their female counterparts, but this size difference is quite marked in the palm cockatoo.|$|E
