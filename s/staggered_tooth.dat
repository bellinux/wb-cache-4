5000|$|The {{most common}} tool styles used in arbor milling are: double angle, form relived, plane, and <b>staggered</b> <b>tooth</b> Among many other tool styles. The double {{angle milling cutter}} can make {{a wide variety of}} V shaped cuts with {{straight}} surfaces in the material. A form relieved milling cutter can produce U shaped cuts with curved surfaces, unlike the double angle cutter, into the material. A plane milling cutter can produce surfaces similar to a planer but can make varying contours across the material. A <b>staggered</b> <b>tooth</b> milling cutter can produce a rectangular groove in the material at varying depths and widths. The cutters can be stacked to mill combined profiles. The typical width of cuts made by arbor milling range from [...]25 in. to 6 in, and the typical depths range from [...]02 in. to [...]05 in.|$|E
40|$|Flanged joints with <b>staggered</b> <b>teeth</b> {{corresponding}} to ISO 8667 and 12557 {{proved to be}} especially suited for commerical vehicles with motive powers #>=# 300 kW and load torques up to 42 kN. In this work damage mechanisms under extreme load have been characterized in an experimental and theoretical investigation {{on the effect of}} pure torsion and of torsion superimposed by axial force. It is demonstrated that the durability life of flanged joints with <b>staggered</b> <b>teeth</b> is mainly determined by operational and design-based loads. It is only to a minor degree influenced by the toothing quality. On account of the complex relations governing durability, the VDI 2230 can not be applied and a simple analytical method for life computation could not be derived.

50|$|Actually, the {{earliest}} description of an escapement, in Richard of Wallingford's 1327 manuscript Tractatus Horologii Astronomici {{on the clock}} he built at the Abbey of St. Albans, was not a verge, but a variation called a strob escapement. It consisted {{of a pair of}} escape wheels on the same axle, with alternating radial teeth. The verge rod was suspended between them, with a short crosspiece that rotated first in one direction and then the other as the <b>staggered</b> <b>teeth</b> pushed past. Although no other example is known, it is possible that this was the first clock escapement design.|$|R
50|$|Early {{clinical}} signs include restlessness, excitement, trismus, grinding of <b>teeth,</b> <b>staggering</b> gait and later paddling of hind legs. Rumen hypomotility, gastrointestinal stasis and anorexia develop. Also may develop tachycardia and rapid, labored respiration. If not recovered, cattle die, often after a coma.|$|R
50|$|Where the oppositely angled teeth meet in {{the middle}} of a {{herringbone}} gear, the alignment may be such that tooth tip meets tooth tip, or the alignment may be <b>staggered,</b> so that <b>tooth</b> tip meets tooth trough. The latter alignment is the unique defining characteristic of a Wuest type herringbone gear, named after its inventor.|$|R
25|$|The entire railway is {{fitted with}} the rack rail. On sidings {{and around the}} yard at Llanberis it {{comprises}} a single rack bar, but on the running line, and through all the loops up the mountain, two rack bars are used, mounted {{side by side with}} their <b>teeth</b> <b>staggered</b> by half a pitch. This {{is one of the major}} features of the Abt system, and helps to reduce the shock of the pinions running along the rack. It also ensures the pinion maintains continuous contact with the rack. The joints between rack bars are also staggered and align with the sleepers – each sleeper supports the rack rail as well as the running rails.|$|R
40|$|Linear flux-switching {{permanent}} magnetic (LFSPM) {{machines are}} good choices for long stroke applications. These machines deliver high thrust force density {{in addition to}} the machine structure where permanent magnetics (PMs) and windings are all on the short mover. For LFSPM machines, their performance is always affected by big thrust force ripple. In this paper, for two C-core LFSPM machines of high thrust force capability, including a 6 / 13 C-core LFSPM (6 / 13 LFSPM-C) machine and a sandwiched C-core LFSPM (SLFSPM-C) machine, and a thrust force ripple reduction method is proposed. The proposed method is developed by reducing the slot effect component of the cogging force based on <b>staggered</b> stator <b>tooth,</b> and suppressing the thrust force ripple caused by unbalanced three phase back-electromagnetic forces (EMFs) based on two end PMs. Based on finite element analysis (FEA) results, both C-core LFSPM machines can achieve small thrust force ripples as well as high sinusoidal back-EMFs, and at the same time, maintain high thrust force capability with the proposed method. It was also found that, the improved SLFSPM-C machine exhibited the same thrust force capability as the improved 6 / 13 LFSPM-C machine, but with a much smaller thrust force ripple...|$|R
5000|$|From 1972 to 1976 for his dissertation, Horst Doepcke, a {{scientific}} {{assistant at the}} Institute for Machine Tools and Manufacturing Engineering at the University of Braunschweig, developed a specific carbide cutting geometry for tubes which had every tooth splitting each chip into two.In 1984, Speedcut Inc. of Rockford, Illinois developed another type of carbide tooth geometry by the name of, [...] "Notch Grind". This was used for steel billets and it would split the chip with one <b>staggered</b> groove per <b>tooth.</b> With the incorporation of this “Notch Grind” technology, saws became significantly faster than with the Braunschweig geometry.For several years after, various companies have been developing carbide saw blades with exchangeable carbide tips. These saw blades, so far, have not been proven economical for cutting steel.|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of the flow through the labyrinth seals with the shaft of the rotor can {{have an effect on}} the stability of turbomachines. Thus, the excited forces, so-called cross forces or nonconservative forces, arise, which act perpendicular to the rotor eccentricity. This effect is caused by an unsymmetrical pressure distribution within the labyrinth cavities. Experimental studies were carried out for different types of labyrinth geometries: two <b>staggered</b> labyrinths with <b>teeth</b> on the stator and grooved rotor as well as a full and a convergent stepped labyrinth. These labyrinths can be found on the tip shrouding of bladings in steam or gas turbines. The following parameters were varied in the test facility: geometry of the labyrinth seals (number of cavities, inlet region), shaft rotation, pressure difference on the seal, entry swirl and eccentricity of the rotor. The results are presented for stiffness coefficients of the labyrinth seals, leakage flow and circumferential flow in each cavity which was measured with special probes. Generally, the inlet swirl has the greatest influence on the coefficients of the seals. The experimental results were compared with theoretical results and were in good agreement...|$|R
