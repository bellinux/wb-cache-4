This study compared the words the deep dyslexic patient LW read correctly with those she omitted and those to which she produced <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> {{in terms of their}} concreteness, age-of-acquisition, frequency, and length. <b>Semantic</b> <b>errors</b> were made to less concrete, later-acquired, and shorter words than were read correctly; there was no reliable effect of word frequency.

40|$|AbstractDetecting <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> {{in a text}} {{is still}} a {{challenging}} area of investigation. A lot of {{research has been done}} on lexical and syntactic errors while fewer studies have tackled <b>semantic</b> <b>errors,</b> as they are more difficult to treat. Compared to other languages, Arabic appears to be a special challenge for this problem. Because words are graphically very similar to each other, the risk of getting <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> in Arabic texts is bigger. Moreover, there are special cases and unique complexities for this language. This paper deals with the detection of <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> in Arabic texts but the approach we have adopted can also be applied for texts in other languages. It combines four contextual methods (using statistics and linguistic information) in order to decide about the semantic validity of a word in a sentence. We chose to implement our approach on a distributed architecture, namely, a Multi Agent System (MAS). The implemented system achieved a precision rate of about 90 % and a recall rate of about 83 %...|$|R

Thus, this study aims at not only examining Arab learners’ <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> in English, {{how they can be}} classified but also investigating their possible L 1 and L 2 sources. 30 essays written by Yemeni University third-level students majoring in English were analyzed. We have also employed a comprehensive error taxonomy based on James’s (1998) and Al-Shormani’s (2010). The <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> identified in this study were classified into three broad categories, namely, lexical, collocation and lexicogrammatical. Each of these categories is classified into further categories and subcategories depending on the errors identified. There were 1388 <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> identified in our study. It has been found that omission of letters category scores the highest number of errors, viz. 251, i. e. 18. 08 % while misselection of a prefix category is the lowest where only 12, i. e. (0. 68 %) errors were committed. A hierarchy of difficulty is established where formal misformations category represents the highest extreme and formal misselection the lowest one. It has also been found that L 1 sources include translating concepts, words and phrases literally from L 1, i. e. Arabic into L 2, i. e. English and applying Arabic linguistic rules to English.

In picture naming, semantic errors (horse for goat) generally result from something having gone awry in lexical access such that the right concept was mapped to the wrong word. This study used the new lesion analysis technique known as voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to investigate the locus of lesions {{that give rise to}} semantic naming errors. Semantic errors were obtained from 64 individuals with post-stroke aphasia, who also underwent high-resolution structural brain scans. Whole brain voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping was carried out to determine where lesion status predicted <b>semantic</b> <b>error</b> rate. The strongest associations were found in the left anterior to mid middle temporal gyrus. This area also showed strong and significant effects in further analyses that statistically controlled for deficits in pre-lexical, conceptualization processes that might have contributed to <b>semantic</b> <b>error</b> production. This study is the first to demonstrate a specific and necessary role for the left anterior temporal lobe in mapping concepts to words in production. We hypothesize that this role consists in the conveyance of fine-grained semantic distinctions to the lexical system.

We focus on short-answer reading comprehension questions which have a clearly defined target response but the learner may convey the meaning of the target in multiple ways. As empirical basis of our work, we collected an English as a Second Language (ESL) learner corpus of short-answer reading comprehension questions, for which two graders provided target answers and correctness judgments.

40|$|Epistemic Contextualism is {{the view}} that “knows that” is semantically {{context-sensitive}} and that properly accommodating this fact into our philosophical theory promises to solve various puzzles concerning knowledge. Yet Epistemic Contextualism faces a big—some would say fatal—problem: The <b>Semantic</b> <b>Error</b> Problem. In its prominent form, this runs thus: speakers just don’t seem to recognise that “knows that” is context-sensitive; so, if “knows that” really is context-sensitive then such speakers are systematically in error about what is said by, or how to evaluate, ordinary uses of “S knows that p”; but since it's wildly implausible that ordinary speakers should exhibit such systematic error, the expression “knows that” isn't context-sensitive. We are interested in whether, and in what ways, there is such semantic error; {{if there is such}} error, how it arises and is made manifest; and, again, if there is such error to what extent it is a problem for Epistemic Contextualism. The upshot is that some forms of The <b>Semantic</b> <b>Error</b> Problem turn out to be largely unproblematic.

40|$|This thesis has {{analyzed}} 50 English compositions {{written by}} Japanese {{college students in}} order to determine some of the reasons for <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> which occur in the student themes. Five major categories of <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> were identified: (A) Semantically Wrong Choice of Lexical Items, (B) Omission of Words or Phrases Semantically Necessary, (C) Errors with the Structure of Phrases and Clauses, (D) Words Used in the Wrong Form Class, (E) Errors in Idiomatic Usage. From this analysis, it has been determined that the major cause of error was semantically wrong choice of lexical items, the choice of verbs, determiners, and P-words being particularly troublesome. This analysis also revealed that some of the causes for <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> were native language interference, differences in meaning distinctions and scopes of meaning in one language or the other, incomplete knowledge of grammatical and lexical restrictions of words, interference within English itself, and cultural interference.

40|$|<b>Semantic</b> <b>errors</b> are {{the most}} common type of slip of the tongue for normal speakers; they are also {{considered}} to be the hallmark of progressive diseases that affect semantic memory such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and semantic dementia. In unimpaired speakers, <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> have been shown to be affected by syntactic variables. For example, Marx (1999) has shown that speakers of a gendered language such as German tend to substitute a target with another word that shares the same grammatical gender with the target more often than chance would predict. This finding suggests that errors occur at a level at which lexical information about the target is activated and retrieved. Here, we assess whether such an effect of syntactic variables (gender) also holds in experimental tasks designed to induce errors in unimpaired speakers of Italian (another gendered language) and whether this effect can also be observed in the <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> produced in the same task by AD patients. We found that for the unimpaired speakers, the gender of the target word constrained the error committed, while this was not the case for the AD patients. We take this finding to suggest a different locus for the errors in the two populations: while the <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> by the unimpaired speakers occur because of misselection of a lexical entry due to lexical competition among semantically similar words, the errors by the AD patients occur because of insufficient activation of lexical representations...|$|R

40|$|Deep {{dyslexia}} is {{an acquired}} reading disorder {{in which a}} previously literate adult produces <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> during reading and demonstrates impaired nonword reading. Most models of the syndrome account for the reading errors observed in deep dyslexia in terms of multiple loci of damage. In contrast, Buchanan, McEwen, Westbury, and Libben (2003) proposed that reading errors result from damage in the phonological output lexicon alone. According to this formulation, <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> evolve from impaired explicit assess and production due to failure of inhibition.

40|$|Background: The {{involvement}} of the semantic system in picture naming is undisputed. However, it has been proposed that translation could take place via direct lexical links between L 1 and L 2 word forms in addition to or instead of via semantics (i. e., with translation going from a spoken word in L 1 accessing its meaning and this meaning then leading to the retrieval of the translation equivalent in L 2). There is conflicting evidence in the psycholinguistic literature as {{to the extent of}} semantic mediation in translation vs. picture naming tasks (Potter et al, 1984; Kroll and Stewart, 1994). More recently, Hernandez et al (2010) investigated this question in a case study of JFF, a proficient bilingual Spanish-Catalan speaker with Alzheimer’s disease and naming difficulties due to a semantic deficit. As JFF’s semantic deficit did not only affect picture naming but also translation tasks, the authors concluded against the existence of functional direct lexical links to support translation. The goal of our study was to explore this issue further in a larger sample of proficient bilingual patients with aphasia and word finding difficulties in both languages. More specifically, we compare the rate of <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> produced in naming vs. translation tasks. Hypotheses: If there is equal {{involvement of}} the semantic system in naming and in translation tasks, then there should be no difference in the rate of <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> produced in the two tasks. However, if there are at least partly functional direct lexical links between translation equivalents, then we should observe fewer <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> in translation than in naming. Participants. Nine Welsh-English early proficient bilingual aphasic participants were selected for participation. Each patient scored significantly lower (p <. 05) than age-matched controls (N= 37) on at least one task using the modified t-tests for single cases (Crawford & Howell, 1998), and made <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> on naming tasks in both languages. Although several of the patients demonstrated semantic impairment, the main difficulty was with word retrieval. Methods: Picture naming and translation tasks were administered in each language. Each task included 80 items, matched across languages for frequency, word length and number of cognates; naming and translation probed the same words. Results: Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Tests showed significantly fewer <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> overall in translation tasks compared to naming tasks within each language, English: Z = - 2. 53, p =. 004; Welsh: Z = - 2. 03, p =. 020. At the individual level, this effect was significant for 8 out of the 9 patients when <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> were compared to both overall errors and to overall number of test items (Fisher’s exact test, p <. 01). Discussion: Eight out of 9 patients made significantly more <b>semantic</b> <b>errors</b> in a picture naming task compared to a translation task with the same target items. This is at odds with the findings of Hernandez et al (2010) and is consistent with the hypothesis that translation takes place, at least in part, via direct lexical connections between languages with reduced semantic mediation...|$|R
