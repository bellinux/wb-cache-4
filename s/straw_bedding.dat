50|$|Two {{other schemes}} deserve mention. The first was for Swinefleet Warping Drain, {{to the east}} of the moors, the first part of which opened in 1821.

He died in 1882, just as ideas for using the peat, rather than improving it for agriculture, were developing.

50|$|The Hessian fly or barley midge, Mayetiola destructor, is {{a species}} of fly that is a {{significant}} pest of cereal crops including wheat, barley and rye. Though a native of Asia it was transported into Europe and later into North America, supposedly in the <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> of Hessian troops during the American Revolution (1775-83). There are usually two generations a year but may be up to five. In the spring the dark-coloured female lays about 250 to 300 reddish eggs on plants, usually where the stems are covered by leaves; the larvae feed on the sap and weaken the plants so that they cannot bear grain.The hessian fly was described by Thomas Say in 1817. It is a very harmful insect. It mainly attacks the stem, although if it is really hungry it will eat {{any part of the}} plant it can find.In 1836 a severe infestation of Hessian flies resulted in a crop shortage aggravating the financial problems of farmers prior to the Panic of 1837.|$|E
50|$|Most {{animal manure}} {{consists}} of feces. Common forms of animal manure include farmyard manure (FYM) or farm slurry (liquid manure). FYM also contains plant material (often straw), {{which has been}} used as bedding for animals and has absorbed the feces and urine. Agricultural manure in liquid form, known as slurry, is produced by more intensive livestock rearing systems where concrete or slats are used, instead of <b>straw</b> <b>bedding.</b> Manure from different animals has different qualities and requires different application rates when used as fertilizer. For example horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens, turkeys, rabbits, and guano from seabirds and bats all have different properties. For instance, sheep manure is high in nitrogen and potash, while pig manure is relatively low in both. Horses mainly eat grass and a few weeds so horse manure can contain grass and weed seeds, as horses do not digest seeds the way that cattle do. Chicken litter, coming from a bird, is very concentrated in nitrogen and phosphate and is prized for both properties.|$|E

40|$|Background Domesticated grazing animals {{including}} {{horses and}} donkeys are frequently housed using deep litter bedding systems, {{where it is}} commonly presumed {{that there is no}} risk of infection from the nematodes that are associated with grazing at pasture. We use two different approaches to test whether equids could become infected with cyathostomines from the ingestion of deep litter <b>straw</b> <b>bedding.</b> Methods Two herbage plot studies were performed in horticultural incubators set up to simulate three <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> scenarios and one grass turf positive control. Faeces were placed on 16 plots, and larval recoveries performed on samples of straw/grass substrate over 2 - to 3 -week periods. Within each incubator, a thermostat was set to maintain an environmental temperature of approximately 10 °C to 20 °C. To provide further validation, 24 samples of <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> were collected over an 8 -week period from six barns in which a large number of donkeys were housed in a deep litter <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> system. These samples were collected from the superficial bedding at 16 sites along a “W” route through each barn. Results No infective larvae were recovered from any of the plots containing dry straw. However, infective cyathostomine larvae were first detected on day 8 from plots containing moist straw. In the <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> study, cyathostomine larvae were detected in 18 of the 24 samples. Additionally, in the two barns which were sampled serially, the level of larval infectivity generally increased from week to week, except when the <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> was removed and replaced. Conclusions We have demonstrated that equine cyathostomines can develop to infective larvae on moist <b>straw</b> <b>bedding.</b> It is therefore possible for a horse or donkey bedded in deep litter straw to become infected by ingesting the contaminated straw. This has implications for parasite control in stabled equids and potentially in housed ruminants, and further investigation is required in order to establish the relative infective pressure from pasture versus <b>straw</b> <b>bedding...</b>|$|E
40|$|Both dietary {{fermentable}} {{carbohydrates and}} the availability of <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> potentially affect activity patterns and energy utilisation in pigs. The present study aimed to investigate the combined effects of <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> and fermentable carbohydrates (native potato starch) on energy partitioning in growing pigs. In a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, 16 groups of 12 pigs (approximately 25 kg) were assigned to either barren housing or housing on <b>straw</b> <b>bedding,</b> and to native or pregelatinised potato starch included in the diet. Pigs were fed at approximately 2. 5 times maintenance. Nitrogen and energy balances were measured per group during a 7 -day experimental period, which was preceded by a 30 -day adaptation period. Heat production and physical activity were measured during 9 -min intervals. The availability of <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> increased both metabolisable energy (ME) intake and total heat production (P < 0. 001). Housing conditions did not affect total energy retention, but pigs on <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> retained more energy as protein (P < 0. 01) and less as fat (P < 0. 05) than barren-housed pigs. Average daily gain (P < 0. 001), ME intake (P < 0. 001) and energy retention (P < 0. 01) were lower in pigs on the native potato starch diet compared to those on the pregelatinised potato starch diet. Pigs on the pregelatinised potato starch diet showed larger fluctuations in heat production and respiration quotient over the 24 -h cycle than pigs on the native potato starch diet, and a higher activity-related energy expenditure. The effect of dietary starch type on activity-related heat production depended, however, on housing type (P < 0. 05). In barren housing, activity-related heat production was less affected by starch type (16. 1 % and 13. 7 % of total heat production on the pregelatinised and native potato starch diet, respectively) than in straw-enriched housing (21. 1 % and 15. 0 % of the total heat production on the pregelatinised and native potato starch diet, respectively). In conclusion, the present study shows that the availability both of <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> and of dietary starch type, fermentable or digestible, affects energy utilisation and physical activity of pigs. The effects of housing condition on protein and fat deposition suggest that environmental enrichment with long straw may result in leaner pigs. The lower energy expenditure on the physical activity of pigs on the native potato starch diet, which was the most obvious in straw-housed pigs, likely reflects a decrease in foraging behaviour related to a more gradual supply of energy from fermentation processes...|$|E

40|$|After intensifying pig {{husbandry}} {{in the second}} half of the 20 th century to improve economical development, public concern brought about legislation to secure animal welfare and ecological values. The development of welfare-friendly sow husbandry in recent years focussed mainly on two purposes: to keep sows loose in groups and to provide the sows with <b>straw</b> <b>bedding.</b> The main objective of this research was to establish the effect on ammonia emission of group housing and <b>straw</b> <b>bedding,</b> and eventually to find tools to reduce the emission. With <b>straw</b> <b>bedding,</b> the greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide were also considered, because environmental goals are not served by pollution swapping. The results showed that group housing of sows does not increase ammonia emission compared to individual housing of sows. Given appropriate straw management, providing a straw bed reduces ammonia emission, and emissions of methane and nitrous oxide are not substantial. However more research is needed in order to understand the conditions for low greenhouse-gas emissions. Although the measured effect was modest, shifting feeding time might be a tool to reduce ammonia emission. A model was developed to estimate ammonia emission from a sow house with group housing and <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> as the sum of the emissions from straw, solid floors, slatted floors and pits after urinations. The results of simulations show that measures to reduce ammonia emissions are most effective if aimed at decreasing the emission from the solid floor and stimulating relatively more urinations on the straw bed. The model appeared to be a useful tool for designing straw-bedded sow group-housing with low ammonia emissions...|$|E

The cellulose bedding was characterized by higher temperatures throughout the production cycle except for weeks 10., 12., 13. and 14. The warmer bedding meant that the appearing encrustation did not restrict the diffusion of vapour and gases. It exhibited more beneficial, aerobic conditions for exothermic processes.
