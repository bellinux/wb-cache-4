Both wrote best-selling books about their lives and, in 1990, a full-length biographical film entitled The Krays was released (featuring real-life brothers Martin and Gary Kemp as the Kray twins). Jack McVitie was portrayed by actor Tom Bell in this film before also appearing in the 2004 film Charlie, this time depicted by Marius Swift. In the 2015 film about the Krays, Legend, he is played by Sam Spruell.|$|E
25|$|When football-proper was resumed, in 1919–20, Blackpool had by {{that point}} joined the {{increasing}} number of clubs to appoint a full-time manager, in the form of Bill Norman. Norman had taken over the role twelve months earlier after leaving Huddersfield Town. A fitness fanatic, Norman organised strict training routines in an attempt to make his footballers achieve the highest possible level of fitness. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the trick, as Blackpool finished fourth in Division Two, their highest finish yet, and won the Central League Championship; however, their progress in the FA Cup ended in the second round.|$|E
25|$|Following November 1919 elections, Iorga {{became a}} member of the Senate, {{representing}} the Democratic Nationalists. Although he resented the universal male suffrage and viewed the adoption of electoral symbols as promoting political illiteracy, his PND came to use a logo representing two hands grasping (later replaced with a black-flag-and-sickle). The elections <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> away with the old political system: Iorga's party was third, trailing behind two newcomers, the Transylvanian PNR and the Poporanist Peasants' Party (PȚ), with whom it formed a parliamentary bloc supporting an Alexandru Vaida-Voevod cabinet. This union of former rivals also showed Iorga's growing suspicion of Brătianu, whom he feared intended to absorb the PND into the National Liberal Party, and accused of creating a political machine. He and his disciples were circulating the term politicianism ("politicking"), expressing their disappointment for the new political context.|$|E

Hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians. Even the imperial magistracy was hit, as any and all who had associated with Sejanus or could in some way be tied to his schemes were summarily tried and executed, their properties seized by the state.

500|$|The most {{pressing}} {{concern of the}} Luxembourgish government was that of food supply. [...] The war had made importation of food an impossibility, {{and the needs of}} the German occupiers inevitably came before those of the Luxembourgish people. [...] To slow the food supply's diminishment, Michel Welter, the Director-General for both agriculture and commerce, banned the export of food from Luxembourg. [...] Furthermore, the government introduced rationing and price controls to counteract the soaring demand and to make food more affordable for poorer Luxembourgers. [...] However, the measures did not have the desired effect. [...] Increasing numbers of Luxembourgers turned to the black market, and, to the consternation of the Luxembourgish government, the German army of occupation <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> little to help. [...] Moreover, the government accused Germany of aiding the development of the black market by refusing to enforce regulations, and even of smuggling goods themselves.|$|E
500|$|Clem Hill said, [...] "As {{a captain}} Harry Trott {{was in a}} class by himself—the best I ever played under. [...] Harry was quick to grasp a situation. He saw an opponent's {{weakness}} in a second. [...] Time and time again, he got a champion batsman's wicket by putting on a bowler he knew the batsman did not like." [...] The English batsman K. S. Ranjitsinhji considered Trott as a captain [...] "without a superior anywhere today". Wisden thought him, [...] "with the exception of ... incomparably the best captain the Australians had ever had in this country." [...] The sporting newspaper The Referee wrote, [...] " [...] bowlers felt he understood the gruelling nature of their work and that they had his sympathy in the grimmest of battles." [...] Some English professional cricketers thought less of Trott's captaincy; wicket-keeper William Storer said, [...] "I like a captain to have a settled plan, [...] just <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> whatever he thought of at the moment." ...|$|E

500|$|Corporal Burdett later stated, [...] "When McCudden {{took off}} {{he put the}} machine into a nearly {{vertical}} climb, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a half-roll and then nosed dived into a wood.....it was usual for scout pilots to perform some little stunt.....I {{think that is what}} he was doing." [...] Witness Lieutenant L.M Fenton had a different view, [...] "the aircraft took off into wind and at about 100 feet did a vertical turn and flew back across the aerodrome {{by the side of the}} wood. The engine appeared to be running badly. The pilot rolled the machine, which failed to straighten out, at approximately 200 feet. It crashed nose down into the wood." [...] Lieutenant E.M Greenwood stated he thought the crash was the result of a failed aerobatic manoeuvre: [...] "I was watching an S.E.5 flying over the aerodrome at about 200 feet, when it did one complete roll to the right, then dived steeply to the ground behind the trees." [...] Lieutenant K.V King believed a similar thing: [...] "......very low over the aerodrome, going east towards the wood on the south-east side of the aerodrome. He had apparently been rolling. I saw him nose down and engine off entering the trees and immediately afterwards heard a crash." [...] Lieutenant [...] T.H Barry, though supports the notion that something was amiss with the engine:"I saw an S.E.5 flying from west to east across the aerodrome at 200–300 feet. The engine was firing irregularly. Just after crossing the end of the aerodrome the pilot did a sharp stalling turn. The nose dropped and it dived behind the trees. During this dive the noise of the engine ceased." ...|$|E
500|$|McKinley {{had been}} given nutritive enemas; on September 11, he took some broth by mouth. [...] When it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> him good, the {{following}} morning they allowed him toast, coffee, and chicken broth. [...] His subsequent pain was diagnosed as indigestion; he was given purgatives and most doctors left after their evening consultation. [...] In the early morning of September 13, McKinley suffered a collapse. [...] Urgent word to return to Buffalo was sent to Vice President Roosevelt, [...] from the nearest telegraph or telephone in the Adirondack wilderness; a park ranger was sent to find him. [...] Specialists were summoned; although at first some doctors hoped that McKinley might survive with a weakened heart, by afternoon they knew the case was hopeless. As yet unknown to the doctors, gangrene was growing {{on the walls of}} his stomach and toxins were passing into his blood. [...] McKinley drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} all day; when awake he was the model patient. [...] By evening, McKinley too knew he was dying, [...] "It is useless, gentlemen. I think we ought to have prayer." [...] His friends and family were admitted, and the First Lady sobbed over him, [...] "I want to go, too. [...] I want to go, too." [...] Her husband replied, [...] "We are all going, we are all going. [...] God's will be done, not ours" [...] and with final strength put an arm around her. [...] He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn, [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee", although other accounts have her singing it softly to him. [...] Ida McKinley was led away, her place briefly taken by Senator Hanna. [...] Morgan recounts their final encounter, [...] "Sometime that terrible evening, Mark Hanna had approached the bedside, tears standing in his eyes, his hands and head shaking in disbelief that thirty years of friendship could end thus." [...] When a tentative, formal greeting gained no coherent response, Hanna [...] "cried out over the years of friendship, 'William, William, don't you know me?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{him some}} good, {{as he started}} hitting right after the incident occurred. Valentine hit a pinch hit three run home run to carry the Expos to a 7-5 victory over the San Francisco Giants {{in his first game}} back, and went 12-for-33 with ten RBIs in his first ten games back from his suspension. In the first game of a May 27 doubleheader with the St. Louis Cardinals, he drove in six runs to carry the Expos to an 8-3 victory. In the second game, he drove in a seventh run to establish a club record for RBIs in a doubleheader. The next day, he drove in four runs against the Philadelphia Phillies. The Expos won a franchise best 95 games in 1979 to finish two games back of the Pittsburgh Pirates. For his part, Valentine batted [...]276 with 21 home runs and a career high 82 RBIs.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the first}} day of June, the Yankees set a Major League record with 18 {{consecutive}} errorless games. Late in the month, the Yankees struggled in interleague play, losing two of three to the Nationals and Marlins, falling to five games back in the division. When the Yankees lost the first game of a three-game series against the Atlanta Braves, Yankee GM Brian Cashman flew down to Atlanta to motivate the team in a closed-door meeting. Initially, his words <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> little, as in the next game [...] (6/24), the Yankees were being no-hit through six innings. After Brett Gardner walked and was picked off at first base – a borderline call by umpire Bill Welke – Joe Girardi protested and was ejected from the baseball game by Welke. The next batter, rookie catcher Francisco Cervelli, hit his first big-league home run to tie the game at 1, and the Yankees {{went on to win the}} game 8-4. Many sports analysts viewed this game as a major turning point in the Yankees' season.|$|E
2500|$|Further studies, e.g. Jerome Ravetz 1971 Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems {{referred}} {{to the role of}} the scientific community, as a social construct, in accepting or rejecting (objective) scientific knowledge. The Science wars of the 1990 were about the influence of especially French philosophers, which denied the objectivity of science in general or <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. They described as well differences between the idealized model of a pure science and the actual scientific practice; while scientism, a revival of the positivism approach, saw in precise measurement and rigorous calculation the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies. However, more recently some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their postmodern deconstructions have at times been counter-productive, and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests. Bruno Latour noted that [...] "dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives. [...] Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we meant?" ...|$|E
