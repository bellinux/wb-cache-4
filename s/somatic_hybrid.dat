During breeding programs, species genomes are often put together through either sexual or somatic hybridization. Therefore, the determination of the GA composition of hybrids is very important in that it may affect either human consumption, or resistance to pathogen and pests. Here, we report the results of GA analysis performed on wild Solanum bulbocastanum, haploids of cultivated potato S. tuberosum and their interspecific <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrids.</b> GAs were extracted from tubers and analyzed by HPLC. HPLC Profile of S. tuberosum haploids showed, as expected, the presence of a-solanine and a-chaconine.

40|$|Summary Unlike {{maternal}} inheritance in sexual hybridiza-tion, plant somatic hybridization allows transfer, mixing and recombination of cytoplasmic genomes. In {{addition to the}} use of somatic hybridization in plant breeding programs, applica-tion of this unique tool should lead {{to a better understanding of}} the roles played by the chloroplastic and mitochondrial genomes in determining agronomically important traits. The nucleotide sequences of cytoplasmic genomes are much more conserved than those of nuclear genomes. Cytoplasmic DNA composition in <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrids</b> is commonly elucidated either by length polymorphism analysis of restricted genome regions amplified with universal primers (PCR-RF) or by hybridiza-tion of total DNA using universal cytoplasmic probes. In this study, we demonstrate that single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis is a powerful, quick and easy alternative method for cytoplasmic DNA characterization of <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrids,</b> especially for mitochondrial DNA. The tech-nique allows detection of polymorphisms based on both size and sequence of amplified targets. Twenty-two species of the subfamily Aurantioideae were analyzed with eight universal primers (four from chloroplastic and four from mitochondrial regions). Differences in chloroplastic DNA composition were scored in 98 % of all possible two-parent combinations, and dif-ferent mitochondrial DNA profiles were found in 87 % of them.

Variations in sugar and acid content were studied in fruit pulp during the maturing period, and the chemical composition of peel oils was investigated by capillary gas chromatography (GC), GC/mass spectrometry (MS), and (13) C NMR.

40|$|Artificial {{tetraploid}} somatic hybrids {{have been}} developed for sterile triploid citrus breeding by sexual hybridization between diploid and tetraploid somatic hybrids. The genetic structure of diploid gametes produced by tetraploid genotypes depends on the mode of chromosome association at meiosis. In order to evaluate tetraploid inheritance in a tetraploid interspecific <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrid</b> between mandarin and lemon, we performed segregation studies using cytogenetic and single sequence repeat molecular markers. Cytogenetic analysis of meiosis in the <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrid</b> revealed 11 % tetravalents and 76 % bivalents. Inheritance of the tetraploid hybrid was analyzed by genotyping the triploid progeny derived from a cross between a diploid pummelo and the tetraploid <b>somatic</b> <b>hybrid,</b> in order to derive genotypes of the meiospores produced by the tetraploid. A likelihood-based approach was used to distinguish between disomic, tetrasomic, and intermediate inheritance models and to estimate the double reduction rate. In agreement with expectations based the cytogenetic data, marker segregation was largely compatible with tetrasomic and inheritance intermediate between disomic and tetrasomic, with some evidence for preferential pairing of homoeologous chromosomes. This has important implications for the design of breeding programs that involve tetraploid hybrids, and underscores the need to consider inheritance models that are intermediate between disomic and tetrasomic.
