[...] In 2013, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that Lens.com did not commit trademark infringement when it purchased search advertisements using 1-800 Contacts' federally registered 1800 CONTACTS trademark as a keyword. [...] In August 2016, the Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against 1-800 Contacts alleging, among other things, that its <b>search</b> <b>advertising</b> trademark enforcement practices have unreasonably restrained competition {{in violation of the}} FTC Act. [...] 1-800 Contacts has denied all wrongdoing and is scheduled to appear before an FTC administrative law judge in April 2017.|$|E

40|$|<b>Search</b> engine <b>advertising</b> {{has become}} a multibillion-dollar {{business}} {{and one of the}} dominant forms of advertising on the Internet. This study examines the effectiveness of <b>search</b> engine <b>advertising</b> within a multimedia campaign, with explicit consideration of the interaction effects between <b>search</b> engine <b>advertising</b> and television and banner advertising. An advertising tracking study with about 300 respondents interviewed before and about 4, 700 respondents interviewed after the advertising campaign examines the effects on four consumer metrics: advertising awareness, brand awareness, brand image, and brand consumption. We estimate advertising effectiveness and control for correlations across the four ordinal response metrics using a multivariate ordered probit model. The results show that <b>search</b> engine <b>advertising</b> has significant effects on several consumer metrics, even among consumers who do not click on the sponsored advertisement. Television advertising also affects the consumer metrics. However, a negative interaction effect emerges between <b>search</b> engine <b>advertising</b> and television advertising. Banner advertising exerts a positive impact, but only in combination with television advertising. These substantial interaction effects indicate that firms must consider the investments in various media channels simultaneously when they design multimedia campaigns...|$|R

40|$|Each {{search term}} {{put into a}} search engine {{produces}} a separate set of results. Correspondingly, each of the sets of ads displayed alongside these results is priced using a separate auction. <b>Search</b> engine <b>advertising</b> prices therefore reflect willingness to pay for context, unlike traditional ad prices that reflect willingness to pay for audience demographics. A growing policy debate asks if this marketing strategy merely makes advertising more informative, or whether it also effectively extracts rent from advertisers. To inform this debate and to better understand <b>search</b> engine <b>advertising</b> more generally, we examine advertising prices paid by lawyers for 174 Google search terms in 195 locations and exploit a natural experiment in “ambulance-chaser” regulations across states. Where contingency fee limits exist, the relative price of advertising is $ 2. 27 lower. This suggests that context-based pricing allows prices to reflect heterogeneity in the profitability of customer leads. When lawyers cannot contact a client in writing, the relative price per ad click is $ 0. 93 higher. This suggests that context-based pricing allows prices to reflect heterogeneity in advertisers’ other advertising options, even within a given local market. Thus, our results suggest that <b>search</b> engine <b>advertising</b> does give market power to the media platform; however, this market power is mitigated by substantial competition from offline marketing communications channels. <b>search</b> engines, <b>advertising,</b> market power, advertising prices...|$|R
