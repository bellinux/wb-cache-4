The first <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> secretion is approximately 25 to 50 times more sensitive to somatostatin inhibition than is the <b>second</b> <b>phase.</b> In addition, somatostatin inhibition of insulin secretion during the <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> is "reversed" by supplemental calcium, whereas the somatostatin effect on the first phase is unaffected by additional calcium.

5|$|Ovulation is the <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> the ovarian {{cycle in}} which a mature egg is {{released}} from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct. During the follicular phase, estradiol suppresses release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates {{the production of a}} large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E
