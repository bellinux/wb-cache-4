40|$|Optical micro parts, such as glass fibres, require {{handling}} and alignment accuracies {{down to the}} <b>sub</b> micrometer range. <b>Addressing</b> this task, one aim of the Fraunhofer IPT {{is the development of}} new concepts of active gripper systems. In this context a highly integrated, adaptive, rugged and economical gripper system particularly for accurate {{handling and}} alignment of flexible micro parts down to the sub-micron level has been developed. This gripper system can be used on conventional robot systems for carrying out microassembly operations. The robot system does the pre-positioning, the tolerances necessary for the micro-assembly are subsequently realized directly {{at the tip of the}} gripper with the gripper integrated multi-axes system. Positioning systems that achieve the required positioning increments in the sub micron range are already existent. Such systems are normally highly sensitive against mechanical impact and extremely cost intensive. In this paper the development of a highly robust gripper-integrable axes system and its integration in a novel gripper design with a multi-axis adjustment system is presented. The stage is based on the principle of a hydrostatic transmission, which has not been used in micro-assembly before. The stage was accelerated up to 90 m/s(exp 2) in experiments, without being damaged. By integrating four of these highly precise and robust stages into a gripper, it is now possible to finely align the micro-components with four degrees of freedom...|$|R

Those problems {{based on the results of}} pre-survey showed that brand personality of The Body Shop’s Body Mist product that consists of sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication and ruggedness has not yet been fully received good response from respondents. In addition, although The Body Shop’s Body Mist product received the title of Top Brand of the year 2015 - 2016, Top Brand Index value of The Body Shop’s Body Mist product fell in 2016. This shows that the power of the brand personality The Body Shop’s Body Mist product also decreased, because the brand personality is a form factor the first parameter to measure the value of the percentage of TBI, which is top of mind brand awareness. This study aims to determine the influence of the brand personality which consist of sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication and ruggedness towards purchase intention. The results shows that the brand personality and purchase intention is in good category. The results of multiple regression analysis <b>addressing</b> <b>sub</b> variable competence, sophistication and ruggedness significantly influence the purchase intention, and the coefficient of determination shows that the brand personality variables significantly influence the purchase intention by 54, 5 %, and 45, 5 % are influenced by other variables outside of this research...|$|R
40|$|The PCU 9655 is a UFm I 2 C-bus {{controlled}} 16 -channel LED driver {{optimized for}} voltage switch dimming and blinking 100 mA Red/Green/Blue/Amber (RGBA) LEDs. Each LED output {{has its own}} 8 -bit resolution (256 steps) fixed frequency individual PWM controller that operates at approximately 31. 25 kHz with a duty cycle that is adjustable from 0 % to 99. 6 % to allow the LED to be set to a specific brightness value. An additional 8 -bit resolution (256 steps) group PWM controller has both a fixed frequency of about 122 Hz and an adjustable frequency roughly between 15 Hz to once every 16. 8 seconds with a duty cycle that is adjustable from 0 % to 99. 6 % {{that is used to}} either dim or blink all LEDs with the same value. Each LED output can be off, on (no PWM control), set at its individual PWM controller value or at both individual and group PWM controller values. The PCU 9655 operates with a supply voltage range of 3 V to 5. 5 V and the 100 mA open-drain outputs allow voltages up to 40 V. The PCU 9655 {{is one of the first}} LED controller devices in a new Ultra Fast mode (UFm) family. UFm devices offer higher frequency (up to 5 MHz). Software programmable LED Group and three Sub Call I 2 C-bus addresses allow all or defined groups of PCU 9655 devices to respond to a common I 2 C-bus address, allowing for example, all red LEDs to be turned on or off at the same time, thus minimizing I 2 C-bus commands. On power-up, PCU 9655 will have a unique <b>Sub</b> Call <b>address</b> to identify it as a 16 -channel LED driver. This allows mixing of devices with different channel widths. Five hardware address pins on PCU 9655 allow up to 32 devices on the same bus. The Software Reset (SWRST) function allows the master to perform a reset of the PCU 9655 through the I 2 C-bus, identical to the Power-On Reset (POR) that initializes the registers to their default state causing the output voltage switches to be OFF (LED off). This allows an easy and quick way to reconfigure all device registers to the same condition. Additionally, a thermal shutdown feature protects the device when the internal junction temperature exceeds the overtemperature threshold...|$|R
2500|$|In 1998, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), {{the body}} that {{develops}} Canada's national list of endangered species, assessed Atlantic Cod. COSEWIC's designations in theory are informed by reports it commissions and expert discussion in the panel, and it claims to be scientific and apolitical. Recognising faults in processes is not recreational, but {{an important step in}} their improvement. In this case much was mishandled. One observer opined [...] "this process stinks"; the same observer later joined, and then became Chair of, COSEWIC. COSEWIC listed Atlantic cod as [...] "vulnerable" [...] (this category later renamed [...] "special concern") on a single-unit basis, i.e. assuming a single homogeneous population. The basis (single-unit) of designation and the level (vulnerable) assigned was in contrast to the range of designations including [...] "endangered" [...] for some of the 10 management (<b>sub)</b> units <b>addressed</b> in the report that COSEWIC had commissioned from Dr. K.N.I. Bell. That contradiction between the report and the listing reflected political pressure from the DFO; such bureaucratic pressure had been evident through three years of drafts. The 1998 designation followed on from a deferral in 1997 and bureaucratic tactics including what one COSEWIC insider characterised as [...] "a plan to make it late". Press interest prior to the 1998 meeting had, however, likely deterred a further deferral. COSEWIC's 'single unit' basis of listing was at the behest of DFO, despite that DFO itself had previously in criticism demanded (properly, given the new evidence) that the report address multiple stocks. The author had agreed with that criticism and revised accordingly, but DFO then changed its mind without explanation. By the time of COSEWIC's 1998 cod discussion, the Chair had been ousted for having said [...] "I have seen a lot of status reports ... t is as good as I have ever seen in regards to content", and COSEWIC had already attempted to unilaterally alter the 1998 report. The report remains one of an undeclared number that are illegally suppressed (COSEWIC refuses to officially release it unless it can change it [...] "so that it ... reflects COSEWIC's designation"), in this case despite kudos from eminent reviewers of COSEWIC's own choice. COSEWIC in defense asserted a right to alter the report or that Bell had been asked to provide a report that supported COSEWIC's designation; either defense would involve clear violations of ethics, of COSEWIC's procedures at the time, and of the norms of science. The key tactics used to avert any at-risk listing centered on the issue of stock discreteness, and DFO's single-stock stance within COSEWIC contradicted the multiple-stock hypothesis supported by the most recent science (including DFO's, hence DFO's earlier and proper demand that the report address these). Bell has argued that this contradiction between fact and tactic effectively painted management into a corner from which it could not acknowledge or explain the contrast between areas where conservation measures were clearly needed and areas where opposite observations were gaining press attention. In effect, DFO's opposition to a listing compromised its ability to carry out its conservation mandate.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the last}} decade, {{development}} efforts by academia and industry for automated driving functions have increased significantly. Also, the European research project AdaptIVe {{is looking into}} this topic. Within AdaptIVe, 21 different automated driving functions for different speed ranges and target areas have been developed. They have been developed in three <b>sub</b> projects (SPs), <b>addressing</b> different automation scenarios:Sub project 4 : Automation in close-distance scenarios: Addresses manoeuvres at low speed (below 30 km/h) that are characterised {{by the presence of}} close obstacles, such as in parking manoeuvres. Sub project 5 : Automation in urban scenarios: Deals with driving scenarios in urban environments that are characterised by an average speed range of 0 to 70 km/h. Sub project 6 : Automation in highway scenarios: Addresses motorway scenarios (or motorway similar roads) considering velocities up to 130 km/h. Due to the large operation spaces and various complex situations that are covered by these functions, efforts for evaluation are expected to increase significantly. In order to enable an efficient assessment of automated driving functions, within the subproject 7 a comprehensive evaluation methodology addressing this challenge has been developed. Technical Assessment: Evaluates the performance of the developed automated driving functions with respect to a defined baseline. User-related Assessment: Analyses the interaction between the function and the user, trust, usability as well as acceptance of the developed functions. In-Traffic Assessment: Focuses on the effects of the surrounding traffic on the automated driving function as well as the effects of the automated driving function on the surrounding non-users. Impact Assessment: Determines the potential effects of the function with respect to safety and environmental aspects (e. g. fuel consumption, traffic efficiency). The evaluation methodologies developed in previous research projects dealt mainly with active safety functions, for which the assessment focused mainly on testing of functions’ use cases. For automated driving the assessment approach needs to be extended {{in order to ensure that}} the whole situation space which is addressed by the functions is covered. Therefore, in the developed evaluation approach the test resources are allocated based on the functions’ classification in order to enable a holistic and efficient assessment. Hence, the automated driving functions are classified based on their automation level and their operation time in two different function types: • Functions that operate only for a short period of time (seconds up to few minutes). Typical examples are automated parking functions and the minimum risk manoeuvre function. These functions are called "event based”. • Functions that, once they are active, can operate over a longer period of time (minutes up to hours). A typical example of this type of function is a “highway pilot”. They are called "continuously operating" functions...|$|R
