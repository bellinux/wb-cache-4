Specifically, the difference 1 − 0.999... must be smaller than any positive rational number, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be an infinitesimal; but since the reals do not contain nonzero infinitesimals, the difference is therefore zero, and therefore the two values are the same.|$|E
5|$|There {{a number}} of local Welsh breeds of cow, {{including}} the Welsh Black, a breed which dates back to at least 1874. Cattle farming accounts {{for the majority of}} agricultural output in Wales—in 1998 the production of beef contributed 23% of Welsh agricultural output, whilst in 2002 25% of agricultural output was in the production of dairy products. Welsh beef has a European Union Protected Geographical Indicator, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be wholly reared and slaughtered in Wales.|$|E
5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} a being that cannot be conceived not to exist. He argued that if something can be conceived not to exist, then something greater can be conceived. Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can be conceived cannot be conceived not to exist and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> exist. This can be read as a restatement of the argument in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it to be a different, stronger argument.|$|E

5|$|Fruit is rich {{in sugar}} but {{deficient}} in other nutrients, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be eaten in large quantities. Bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, the fruits are juicier and water {{is less of a}} problem.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman empire's {{hierarchical}} system, a vassal king {{usage of}} the King of Kings title did not indicate {{that he is a}} peer of the emperor or that the vassalage ties were cut. The title was probably a challenge not to the Roman emperor but to Shapur I; Odaenathus was declaring that he, not the Persian monarch, was the legitimate King of Kings in the East. A lead token depicting Hairan I shows him wearing a crown shaped like that of the Parthian monarchs, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been Odaenathus' crown; this combination of title and imagery indicate that Odaenathus considered himself the rival of the Sassanians and the protector of the region against them.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords {{has held}} {{that the nature of}} the {{decision-making}} process that the public authority is required to engage in determines whether a matter falls into the precedent fact category. If the process is complex and much discretion is accorded to the authority by the empowering statute, the court is unlikely to find that a precedent fact is involved. On the other hand, where an administrative decision interferes with an individual's liberty, the matter will be considered within the precedent fact category unless Parliament has explicitly excluded judicial review. If Parliament intends to do <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> make its meaning crystal clear.|$|E

5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would seem very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E

25|$|The body schema, to {{function}} properly, {{must be able}} to maintain coherent organization continuously. To do <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be able to resolve any differences between sensory inputs.

25|$|The TECP {{humidity}} sensor {{is a relative}} {{humidity sensor}}, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be coupled with a temperature sensor {{in order to measure}} absolute humidity.

25|$|For lytic {{replication}} to occur, the {{viral genome}} must be linear. The latent EBV genome is circular, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> linearize {{in the process}} of lytic reactivation. During lytic replication, viral DNA polymerase is responsible for copying the viral genome. This contrasts with latency, in which host cell DNA polymerase copies the viral genome.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 15th/early 16th-century Middle Cornish play Beunans Ke, Arthur's sword is called Calesvol, which is {{etymologically}} an exact Middle Cornish cognate of the Welsh Caledfwlch.

25|$|Due to {{the ability}} of thiols to undergo redox reactions, {{cysteine}} has antioxidant properties. Cysteine's antioxidant properties are typically expressed in the tripeptide glutathione, which occurs in humans as well as other organisms. The systemic availability of oral glutathione (GSH) is negligible; <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be biosynthesized from its constituent amino acids, cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid. Glutamic acid and glycine are readily available in most Western diets, but the availability of cysteine can be the limiting substrate.|$|E
