40|$|Summary: Dental {{and medical}} care are closely {{interlinked}} since certain clinical oral manifestations can provide a useful insight into underlying systemic diseases. With recent research highlighting unique ‘two-way’ relationships between systemic and oral disease processes, it is paramount medical students are aware of these. Medical school curricula scarcely cover oral disease and oral examination; {{the purpose of this}} article is to provide a foundation for further learning. A clear focus has been made on four key aspects: the core dental team, oral lesions, dental disease and oral manifestations of <b>systemic</b> drugs. <b>Relevance</b> to Medical Students: Examination of the oral cavity forms an element of the wider physical exam. Hence, an appreciation for dentistry will place medical students in a more confident position knowing that they have an understanding of oral abnormalities. This will not only encourage improved diagnoses but discourage false referrals, making a positive impact on patient care and management. Take Home Messages: Medicine and dentistry have a firm place in the primary health sector as patients share their health concerns with both their general medical practitioner and their general dental practitioner. Patient care can be greatly enhanced if a closer relationship between the two professions is fostered. This educational piece places a step in that direction by presenting to the reader an insight into the multifaceted speciality of dentistry...|$|R

40|$|The uterine cervix plays a {{vital role}} in {{maintaining}} pregnancy and an equally important role in allowing parturition to occur. Progesterone, either endogenously produced or supplied exogenously, supports the function of the cervix in sustaining intrauterine pregnancy, and the withdrawal of progesterone, either through natural processes or pharmacologic intervention, leads to delivery which underscores the importance of the progesterone's biological activities manifest in normal gestation and pregnancy that ends prematurely. Research crossing many scientific disciplines has demonstrated that progesterone is a pleotropic compound that affects the cervix through cytoplasmic and membrane receptors with profound effects on cellular and molecular functions that influence inflammatory cascades and extracellular matrix, both of which have consequences for parturition. Beyond the local cell and molecular biology of progesterone, it has <b>systemic</b> effects of <b>relevance</b> to pregnancy as well. This paper examines the biology of the cervix from its gross to cellular structure and biological activities of its cell and molecular processes that may be affected by progesterone.

Genetic {{studies in the}} last 5 years have greatly facilitated {{our understanding of how}} the dysregulation of diverse components of the innate immune system contributes to pathophysiology of SLE. A role for macrophages in the pathogenesis of SLE was first proposed as early as the 1980 s following the discovery that SLE macrophages were defective in their ability to clear apoptotic cell debris, thus prolonging exposure of potential autoantigens to the adaptive immune response. More recently, there is an emerging appreciation of the contribution both monocytes and macrophages play in orchestrating immune responses with perturbations in their activation or regulation leading to immune dysregulation. This paper will focus on understanding the relevance of genes identified as being associated with innate immune function of monocytes and macrophages and development of SLE, particularly with respect to their role in (1) immune complex (IC) recognition and clearance, (2) nucleic acid recognition via toll-like receptors (TLRs) and downstream signalling, and (3) interferon signalling. Particular attention will be paid to the functional consequences these genetic associations have for disease susceptibility or pathogenesis. 1.

In recent years, natriuretic peptides (NPs) {{have emerged as}} important tools in the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of heart diseases. Research has shown that serum and plasma levels of N-terminal pro brain NP (NT-proBNP) in dogs and cats are the only biomarkers that afford to diagnose and monitor congestive processes and, indirectly, the myocardial function of small animals. The present review discusses the peer-reviewed specialized literature about NT-proBNP and presents and compares the potential clinical applications of this NP in veterinary medicine of small animals, considering diagnosis, follow-up, and prognosis of myocardial or <b>systemic</b> diseases.

40|$|Abstract The gut {{microbiota}} {{is increasingly}} {{considered as a}} symbiotic partner {{for the maintenance of}} health. The homeostasis of the gut microbiota is dependent on host characteristics (age, gender, genetic background…), environmental conditions (stress, drugs, gastrointestinal surgery, infectious and toxic agents…). Moreover, it is dependent on the day-to-day dietary changes. Experimental data in animals, but also observational studies in obese patients, suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota is a factor characterizing obese versus lean individuals, diabetic versus non diabetic patients, or patients presenting hepatic diseases such as non alcoholic steatohepatitis. Interestingly, the changes in the gut microbes can be reversed by dieting and related weight loss. The qualitative and quantitative changes in the intake of specific food components (fatty acids, carbohydrates, micronutrients, prebiotics, probiotics), have not only consequences on the gut microbiota composition, but may modulate the expression of genes in host tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue, intestine, muscle. This in turn may drive or lessen the development of fat mass and metabolic disturbances associated with the gut barrier function and the <b>systemic</b> immunity. The <b>relevance</b> of the prebiotic or probiotic approaches in the management of obesity in humans is supported by few intervention studies in humans up to now, but the experimental data obtained with those compounds help to elucidate novel potential molecular targets relating diet with gut microbes. The metagenomic and integrative metabolomic approaches could help elucidate which bacteria, among the trillions in human gut, or more specifically which activities/genes, could participate to the control of host energy metabolism, and could be relevant for future therapeutic developments. </p...|$|R

The aim of the present thesis was to gain {{deeper understanding of the}} pathophysiological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia with a particular interest in peripheral and <b>systemic</b> manifestations with <b>relevance</b> for the increased risk of obesity and metabolic complications seen in the disease. Therefore, resting energy expenditure (REE), physical capacity, and relevant body composition variables were measured in patients with schizophrenia and in healthy controls. Also niacin skin flush response and electrodermal activity (EDA) were studied. Patients with schizophrenia exhibited significantly lower REE expressed as kJ/kg, and also lower values compared with predicted levels than the controls. The difference could not be attributed to medication or variations in body composition between the two groups. There was a gender difference with the lowest levels found in male patients. Male patients exhibited significantly lower physical capacity in terms of predicted maximal oxygen uptake capacity and faster increase in respiratory quotient than male controls. The oral niacin test revealed a significantly delayed skin flush reaction in patients compared with controls. The patients also exhibited lower EDA response. There was a significant association in response patterns for the niacin and the EDA tests in the patients, but not in controls. In a test-retest study in patients there was acceptable stability for EDA measures but low test-retest stability for niacin variables. The previously found association in responses for the two tests was, however, replicated. The results gain support for the concept of schizophrenia as a disease with systemic manifestations including metabolic dysregulation.

For this reason, topical antimicrobial agent applied {{directly to the}} mesh is often used procedure. So far, however, this procedure lacks a scientific basis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two different meshes (Parietex™, Covidien; Ultrapro™, Ethicon Johnson & Johnson) were incubated with increasing amounts of three different Staphylococcus aureus strains (ATCC 25923; Mu 50; ST 239) with or without gentamicin and growth ability were determined in vitro. To further {{address the question of}} the systemic impact of topic gentamicin, serum levels were analyzed 6 and 24 h after implantation of gentamicin-impregnated multifilament meshes in 19 patients. RESULTS: None of the gentamicin-impregnated meshes showed any bacterial growth in vitro. This effect was independent of the mesh type for all the tested S. aureus strains. In the clinical setting, serum gentamicin levels 6 h after implantation of the gentamicin-impregnated meshes were below the through-level (range 0. 4 - 2. 9 mg/l, mean 1. 2 ± 0. 7 mg/l). After 24 h the gentamicin serum levels in all patients had declined 90 - 65 % of the 6 h values.

40|$|International audienceThe {{impairment}} of hepatic metabolism due to liver injury has high <b>systemic</b> <b>relevance.</b> However, {{it is difficult}} to calculate the {{impairment of}} metabolic capacity from a specific pattern of liver damage with conventional techniques. We established an integrated metabolic spatial-temporal model (IM) using hepatic ammonia detoxification as a paradigm. First, a metabolic model (MM) based on mass balancing and mouse liver perfusion data was established to describe ammonia detoxification and its zonation. Next, the MM was combined with a spatial-temporal model simulating liver tissue damage and regeneration after CCl 4 intoxication. The resulting IM simulated and visualized whether, where, and to what extent liver damage compromised ammonia detoxification. It allowed us to enter the extent and spatial patterns of liver damage and then calculate the outflow concentrations of ammonia, glutamine, and urea in the hepatic vein. The model was validated through comparisons with (1) published data for isolated, perfused livers with and without CCl 4 intoxication and (2) a set of in vivo experiments. Using the experimentally determined portal concentrations of ammonia, the model adequately predicted metabolite concentrations over time in the hepatic vein during toxin-induced liver damage and regeneration in rodents. Further simulations, especially in combination with a simplified model of blood circulation with three ammonia-detoxifying compartments, indicated a yet unidentified process of ammonia consumption during liver regeneration and revealed unexpected concomitant changes in amino acid metabolism in the liver and at extrahepatic sites. Conclusion: The IM of hepatic ammonia detoxification considerably improves our understanding of the metabolic impact of liver disease and highlights the importance of integrated modeling approaches on the way toward virtual organisms...|$|E

40|$|The lungs are {{considered}} {{as one of the}} fastest portals of entry to the bloodstream and oral inhalation (OI) has long been accepted as the preferred mode of administration of therapeutics to the respiratory tract. However, despite its advantages, the lungs have been largely underutilized to target ailments not only of <b>systemic</b> <b>relevance</b> but also several other grave conditions including lung cancer and tuberculosis. Polymeric nanocarriers (PNCs) have several advantages over other drug delivery vehicles including sustained release of moieties, ease of cellular internalization and improved targeting, and hence hold the promise to greatly augment the potential of OI therapies. The surface chemistry, architecture, and size of PNCs may be potentially altered in order to modulate their interaction with the extra and intracellular barriers present in the lung epithelia, and thus their transport, overcoming challenges observed when delivering free drug molecules. They can be utilized to enhance the residence time of drugs required to exert prolonged therapeutic effect in the airspace (regional therapy), and conversely speed up the transport of drug molecules that would traverse sluggishly to the bloodstream (systemic therapy). In this work, we report the preparation, characterization of a series of PNCs ranging from polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) to surface modified dendrimer nanocarriers (DNCs) and we studied their interaction with in vitro and in vivo models of the lung epithelium. We observed that transport and cellular uptake can be efficiently modulated as the surface characteristics of the PNCs is varied, suggesting that OI strategies incorporating such nanoscopic entities may potentially be employed for targeting regional diseases and also the systemic circulation. Finally, we also discuss the formulation, dispersion stability and aerosol characteristics of the aforementioned PNCs in portable, inexpensive pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the relation between bank regulation and the risk-taking behaviour of banks. Two major instruments of regulatory intervention are considered: bank levy and bank bailouts. The major objective of this thesis is to provide an answer to the following questions: Do bank levies increase the risk-taking of banks in a competitive environment? When do bank bailouts decrease banks` risk-taking? Does the international coordination of bank bailouts affect the relation between bailouts and the risk-taking behaviour of banks? Who should rescue subsidiaries of multinational banks? How could an efficient bailout policy be designed and implemented? The bank levy and cooperation between national regulators {{play an important role in}} the recently adopted Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). This directive is a cornerstone of bank regulation in Europe. Although the conversion of debt into equity (bail-in) in emergencies is the key component of the current regulation, bailouts, or at least the assistance to struggling banks, should not be excluded. As the ordinary resolution tools, for instance, bail-in, have not yet been tested in a real crisis, and due to the fact that it will take time to prepare global institutions for such a tool, it may be useful to have an adequately designed tool of last resort available, such as an adequate bailout policy, in order to avoid the disruption of critical economic functions. We show that a bank levy may decrease banks`risk-taking behaviour. Bank bailouts can also decrease the risk-taking of banks. This depends on the regulator`s ability to condition his bailout policy in accordance with the macroeconomic environment, which has an impact on the banks` probability of success, or on his ability to condition the bailout policy on the banks` <b>systemic</b> <b>relevance.</b> Coordination of bailouts through a multinational regulator can improve welfare. The desirability of internationally coordinated bailouts depends on the dimension of the crisis. If the crisis is severe, it may be more efficient to delegate bank bailouts to a multinational regulator. However, such a delegation is not always feasible. Therefore, a predefined burden sharing of bank bailouts is necessary in order to achieve an efficient resolution of banks in distress...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to the recent Financial Crisis - after it had been widely accepted that “a serious disturbance in the economy of Member States” had occurred, and that several measures were required to remedy this disturbance, various Commission communications were adopted and these include: The Communication on the application of State aid rules to measures taken in relation to financial institutions {{in the context of}} the current global financial crisis (hereinafter "the Banking Communication"), its Communication on the recapitalisation of financial institutions in the current financial crisis: limitation of aid to the minimum necessary and safeguards against undue distortions of competition (hereinafter "the Recapitalisation Communication"), and its Communication on the return to viability and the assessment of restructuring measures in the financial sector in the current crisis under the State aid rules (hereinafter "the Restructuring Communication"). ” The Banking Communication will constitute the focus of this study. Are rescue aids (as distinguished from other forms of State aids) justified even where the possibility exists that rescue attempts are unlikely to succeed? Should rescue aids still be granted at a point when other measures such as winding down measures and the provision of other forms of liquidity assistance could be introduced?At what point should the Government decide upon the nationalisation of ailing institutions? Furthermore, should State aids be provided to all classes of financial institutions which are considered to qualify for such aid – as stated within the Banking Communication? These questions interalia constitute questions which are not only raised in this paper, but which this paper aims to address through a consideration of different State aid rescue and restructuring measures, as well as reference to two rescue aid cases, namely those of Bradford & Bingley (State aid NN 41 / 2008 – United Kingdom Rescue Aid to Bradford & Bingley) and Hypo Real Estate (State aid NN 44 / 2008 – Germany Rescue Aid for Hypo Real Estate). In addition, the impact of the recent crisis on the choice of legislation and legal basis for compatibility assessments, will be highlighted. Whereas State aid to individual undertakings in difficulties is usually assessed under Article 87 (3) (c) of the EC Treaty and the Community Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty, the <b>systemic</b> <b>relevance</b> of a financial institution and the impact of such an institution's failure on the economy, has been reflected by the preference for Article 87 (3) (b) EC Treaty and Article 107 (3) (b) TFEU. ...|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{heart failure}} is {{associated}} with low-grade systemic inflammation and anabolic-catabolic imbalance, {{that may lead to}} prognostically relevant cardiac cachexia in advanced stages of the disease. Aim of this work was to characterize the role of the gastrointestinal tract for the development of systemic inflammation and cachexia in patients with chronic heart failure. We found that patients with chronic heart failure have a reduced intestinal blood flow and an edema of the intestinal wall. These alterations are accompanied by a decreased specific intestinal absorption function, permit bacterial overgrowth in the mucus layer adjacent to the apical surface of the colonic mucosa. Furthermore, our studies show that the concentration of adherent juxtamucosal gut bacteria correlates with blood lipopolysaccharide(LPS) -antibodies indicating a systemic response to bacteria in heart failure. Thus, interaction between gut bacteria and immune system of the host, local Inflammation and an increase in intestinal permeability of the intestinal mucosa are conceivable. The fact that higher blood concentrations of LPS were associated with higher degree of inflammation in edematously decompensated patients and that these inflammatory markers decreased after recompensation suggests a cause/effect relationship between edematous gut wall, epithelial dysfunction and translocating LPS. This points to a vicious circle where increased permeability due to lower blood supply leads to an augmented interaction with gut bacteria and local Inflammation again weakening intestinal barrier. As an indicator of <b>systemic</b> <b>relevance</b> of these alterations, we found a correlation of a greater bowel wall thickness of the sigmoid with higher blood C-reactive Protein (CrP) as a hallmark of systemic Inflammation. Furthermore, a greater bowel wall thickness of the ascending colon suggestive of a bowel wall edema, correlated with a higher concentration of blood leucocytes in these patients with heart failure. Low intestinal blood flow in celiac trunk and upper mesenteric artery, correlated with higher blood CrP, too. These results are consistent with a contribution of intestinal hemodynamics to prognostically relevant systemic inflammation. An implementation of the immunological status of the patients should improve risk stratification in heart failure. We were able to show a risk stratification model including 4 factors (soluble tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1 (sTNF-R 1), uric acid, left ventricular ejection fraction and NYHA class) to be highly prognostic in our cohort and therefore integrated intestinal alterations through markers of systemic Inflammation such as sTNF-R 1. In multivariate Regression analysis with limited statistical power, low intestinal arterial blood flow, right ventricular dysfunction, congestive liver dysfunction and low serum albumin were predictive of the presence of cachexia. Research is needed to determine whether interventions that specially increase mesenteric blood flow inhibit the growth of juxtamucosal bacteria, reduce inflammation and GI symptoms, and ameliorate cardiac cachexia in patients with advanced HF. Our studies of intestinal barrier dysfunction in heart failure pave the way for interventional studies that target gut bacteria as source of systemic Inflammation and cardiovascular pathogenesis...|$|E
