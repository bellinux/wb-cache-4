5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} {{not as good as}} the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland {{to spend the rest of}} her life in a convent; <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.|$|E

His friends, Chicago pianists Sam Distefano and Larry Novak, repeatedly tried lecturing {{him in an}} effort to get him to quit, fearing for Bill's health. His brother Harry's suicide may have also influenced his emotional state after 1979. His sister-in-law Pat Evans has stated that she knew Bill wouldn't last long after Harry's death and <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> that's what prompted her to buy three plots in a Baton Rouge Cemetery, where Harry was interred. It has been documented that he voluntarily quit his treatment for chronic hepatitis. Laurie Verchomin has claimed that Evans was clear in mind that he would die in a short time.|$|E
500|$|When Pretty in Pink co-star Molly Ringwald told Out {{magazine}} in 2012 {{that she believed}} Cryer's character was gay, Cryer defended Duckie and other [...] "slightly effeminate dorks," [...] and said {{he has had to}} live with others' [...] "faulty" [...] gaydar. Also in 2012, Joyner told Jeff Probst that when she and Cryer started dating, <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he might be gay because [...] "he never kissed me." [...] Cryer was asked in 2014 if he was [...] "mistaken for gay"; he again called himself [...] "an effeminate heterosexual dork" [...] and cracked a joke about never being propositioned: [...] "Fellas, you're dropping the ball." ...|$|E

500|$|When Stead {{was only}} halfway done, she hit a wall: <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> she had focused the novel {{too much on}} her own {{personal}} life and problems. By her 40th birthday in January 2008, she had stopped writing. One week after her birthday celebration, Stead went to a writers' conference where the presenter advised attendees to stop thinking and just write. This speech worked {{as an antidote to}} Stead's writer's block; she started working on When You Reach Me again. After she had written two-thirds of the novel, Stead sent the draft to her editor Wendy Lamb at Random House. Perusing the script, Lamb found herself absorbed and wanted to help develop the book. Unlike Stead's debut novel First Light, which Lamb heavily edited, Lamb modified nothing on the first draft of When You Reach Me. Throughout the process, Stead helped Lamb understand the complicated concepts in the book and had drafts read by others to make sure [...] "revision hadn't created any holes or contradictions in the plot".|$|E
500|$|Manga creator Katsura Hoshino {{said that}} she did not know how Allen originated, since she likes her main {{characters}} to be rambunctious, rude idiots. She said that the general idea for his design was an [...] "energetic youth with messy fly-a-way hair and other things like that", but when he was drawn with the uniform of the Black Order (the group Allen joins in the series) she sensed a [...] "lack of coordination". Hoshino felt that a more-mature design would be better; although she believed his final design looked best with the Black Order uniform, <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> it should be more masculine. Because he is an Exorcist, she wanted him to have a [...] "very scary-looking image" [...] and added the scar on his left forehead; the scar changed shape several times before becoming a pentagram. Since Hoshino wanted the Order and its enemies to have visual contrast, she gave Allen and the Exorcists black cloaks to convey a [...] "gloomy" [...] impression. Allen's clothing is drawn from Hoshino's general impression of the late nineteenth century, and his ribbon tie and other accessories are intended to project a [...] "gentlemanly image".|$|E

During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife {{to the base}} of Ishida's penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, and he told her to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure. She had him do it to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her obi sash to cut off Ishida's breathing during orgasm, and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida's face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took 30 tablets of a sedative called Calmotin to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, [...] "You'll put the cord around my neck and squeeze it again while I'm sleeping, won't you... If you start to strangle me, don't stop, because it is so painful afterward." [...] Abe commented that <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he had wanted her to kill him, but on reflection decided he must have been joking.|$|E
