25|$|Front Street – The final {{component}} of Adriaen's Landing, 'Front Street', <b>sits</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> the Convention Center and covers the land between Columbus Boulevard and The Hartford Times Building. The Front Street development combines retail, entertainment and residential components. Publicly funded {{parts of the}} project will include transportation improvements. There have been significant delays in the Front Street project – the first developer {{was removed from the}} project because of lack of progress. The city has chosen a new developer, but work is yet to begin on the retail and residential {{component of}} Front Street. The city and state may soon take action to increase the speed with which the project enters implementation phases. There has been talk of bringing an ESPN Zone to the Front Street (ESPN is headquartered in nearby Bristol). On the back side of Front Street, the historic Beaux-Arts Hartford Times Buildinzg is being converted into a downtown campus of the University of Connecticut.|$|E

25|$|Scott Stadium <b>sits</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> the first-year dorms along Alderman Road and {{is home to}} the University of Virginia's {{football}} program. The {{press box}} at Scott Stadium was a gift from an alumnus in honor of Norton G. Pritchett, the admired athletic director at UVA from 1934 until his death in 1950. Students, fans and alumni began to sport orange clothing for the games, a new tradition the former head coach, Al Groh, had been pushing for since he became head coach in 2000. Many students, however, have continued to wear the traditional sundresses or coats and ties at football games. Several fans have also begun garbing themselves in outlandish costumes in the style of football superfans (such as the Orange Gorilla or The Superhoo). Funding from benefactor Carl Smith created the foundation for the 280-piece Cavalier Marching Band in 2004, replacing the Virginia Pep Band in its official capacity at athletic events. The current head coach is Bronco Mendenhall, former head coach at BYU, who replaced Mike London in December 2015.|$|E

2500|$|Augustus Woodward's {{plan for}} Detroit's streets created oddly-shaped {{triangular}} blocks, including Capitol Park {{on the west}} and Harmonie Park on the east. Starting in the 1830s and 1940s, this area was home to {{a growing number of}} German immigrants to Detroit. In 1849, to preserve their ethnic traditions, a group of Detroit Germans founded a singing group, the Gesang-Verein Harmonie. The club built a [...] frame clubhouse at the corner of Lafayette and Beaubien in 1874. This frame Harmonie Club structure burned in 1893, and the club almost immediately organized a competition, open to German architects, to design a new building. Richard Raseman (the architect of the Grand Army of the Republic Building) won the competition; the resulting building <b>sits</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> Harmonie Park.|$|E

2500|$|The {{area around}} Lenox has grown immensely {{in the past}} few decades {{following}} its opening, with expanding retail developments and over 75 restaurants within a mile radius, which has made the area a highly desirable location to live and work. A two-story Target store <b>sits</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> Lenox at Lenox Marketplace, connected inside via escalators and elevators designed for shopping carts as well as shoppers, and having checkouts on both levels at the exits to a parking deck. Other stores at Lenox Marketplace include Dick's Sporting Goods and Neiman Marcus Last Call (Previously the site of a Filene's Basement). [...] The Sembler Company was the developer. In addition, Phipps Plaza is located to the northeast of Lenox Square across Peachtree Road. Traffic levels around Lenox are high and the streets are confusing for those unfamiliar with the area. Georgia 400 opened in 1993, restricting traffic to and from the west after it cut many existing roads. However, the BUC (Buckhead Uptown Connection), the free shuttle bus service around Buckhead, is available, supported voluntarily by a self-taxing district (Buckhead CID) which includes Lenox, and by GRTA and other agencies. The Peachtree Streetcar initiative would also extend free or low-fare streetcars to Lenox in the north, through midtown and downtown, to a proposed mixed-use redevelopment around historic Fort McPherson, [...] south. MARTA, the city's main mass transit system, provides one station across the street from the J W Marriott, as well as the Buckhead station a quarter mile Northwest on Peachtree Road.|$|E

Every now and then, people on the bus sang 'Oh Freedom' and 'We Shall Overcome,' {{but for the most}} part there wasn't a whole bunch of singing.

Ziva is nonetheless furious and disheartened by this, but agrees to <b>sit</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> her father at the dinner table one last time.|$|R
