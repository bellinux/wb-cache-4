40|$|When {{offered a}} choice (Choice Y) between a <b>small</b> <b>immediate</b> reward (2 -sec {{exposure}} to grain) {{and a large}} reward (4 -sec exposure to grain) delayed by 4 sec, pigeons invariably preferred the <b>small,</b> <b>immediate</b> reward. However, when offered a choice (Choice X) between a delay of T seconds followed by Choice Y and a delay of T seconds followed by restriction to the large delayed reward only, the pigeon's choice depended on T. When T was small, the pigeons chose the alternative leading to Choice Y (and then chose the <b>small,</b> <b>immediate</b> reward). When T was large, the pigeons chose the alternative leading to the large delayed reward only. The reversal of preference as T increases is predicted by several recent models for choice between various amounts and delays of reward.

Drawing on this previous work, we propose that an extant just world threat may induce a desire for <b>smaller,</b> <b>immediate</b> rewards at the expense of larger, delayed rewards. Participants were exposed to the suffering of an innocent or non-innocent victim and then, in a different context, completed a temporal discounting task that assessed, across six time delays, their preferences for <b>smaller,</b> <b>immediate</b> monetary rewards versus a constant, larger, delayed reward. Consistent with our reasoning, participants exposed to the suffering of an innocent versus non-innocent victim more steeply discounted the value of the delayed reward-that is, they were willing to accept <b>smaller</b> <b>immediate</b> rewards in place of the larger, delayed reward.

25|$|Like the {{marshmallow}} test, delay discounting {{is also a}} {{delay of}} gratification paradigm. It is designed around the principle that the subjective value of a reinforcer decreases, or is 'discounted,' as the delay to reinforcement increases. Subjects are given varying choices between <b>smaller,</b> <b>immediate</b> rewards and larger, delayed rewards. By manipulating reward magnitude and/or reward delay over multiple trials, 'indifference' points can be estimated whereby choosing the <b>small,</b> <b>immediate</b> reward, or the large, delayed reward are about equally likely.

40|$|Eight pigeons chose {{between a}} <b>small,</b> <b>immediate</b> {{reinforcer}} and a large, increasingly delayed reinforcer. Responding during the large-reinforcer delays was examined. During large-reinforcer delays, pecks on one key produced the <b>small,</b> <b>immediate</b> reinforcer; pecks {{on the other}} key had no effect. Thus, a pigeon could reverse its initial choice of the large, delayed reinforcer, or it could maintain its original choice. Pigeons that made a relatively high number of initial large-reinforcer choices tended to maintain these choices, and those pigeons that actually received a relatively high number of large reinforcers, tended to respond more frequently on the ineffective key during the delay periods. The findings suggest that some previous studies of self-control training in pigeons may have resulted in increased self-control partially {{due to a lack}} of opportunity for the pigeons to change their choices...|$|R

Methods: Participants were 55 undergraduate psychology students. Tasks included a real and hypothetical version of a temporal discounting (TD) task with choices between a large reward (10 cents) after delays up to 60 seconds, and <b>smaller</b> <b>immediate</b> rewards (2 - 8 cents); two versions of a hypothetical temporal discounting task with choices between a large reward ($ 100) after delays up to 120 months, and <b>smaller</b> <b>immediate</b> rewards ($ 1 -$ 95); a Choice Delay Task with choices between one point now and two points after 30 seconds (one point is worth five cents). Results: Correlation analyses showed that the real and the hypothetical TD tasks with 10 cents were very strongly associated. However, the hypothetical TD tasks with $ 100 did not correlate with either the real or the hypothetical TD task with 10 cents. Principal component analysis extracted two components: one for small amounts and short delays, and a second one for large rewards and long delays. Conclusions: Temporal reward discounting is not a uniform construct.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Organisms often choose smatl but {{immediate}} rewards {{over large}} but delayed rewards, to their long-term detriment. When nations choose to arm for immediate relative advantage over an opponent even though disarming {{could lead to}} large but delayed benefits for both parties, their behavior may be understood in this light. Behavioral research with pigeons and humans suggests that the trap-like effects of <b>small</b> <b>immediate</b> rewards can be avoided by arranging delays before the critical choice, or by providing a commitment response that precludes temptation by the <b>small</b> <b>immediate</b> reward. Other methods that {{have been shown to}} be effective include signaling the availability of the large reward during the delay, and rewarding alternative behavior that is compatible with choices of the large delayed reward. Applications of these experimental findings to the behavior of nations are suggested, and strategies for avoiding armament traps and acting for the long-term common good are proposed...|$|R

Six preschoolers, including one comparison subject, identified by their teachers as impulsive, were preassessed and found consistently to select <b>smaller</b> <b>immediate</b> reinforcers over larger, more delayed ones. The teaching procedure consisted of gradually increasing the durations of the delay interval over many sessions. The follow-up assessments showed that 5 of these children increased the proportion of their choices of the delayed reinforcers. Before training, indifference points ranged from 1. 7 to 51. 7 s; following treatment, points rose to a range of 37. 5 to at least 90 s, with 3 children preferring the larger reinforcer at all delay intervals tested.

40|$|Many changes {{occur in}} the lives of persons {{incurring}} a brain injury including the loss of in-dependence, disruption of a previously existing family structure, and confronting new psychologi-cal and physical disabilities (McGuire & Sylvester, 1990). An important element in a comprehensive rehabilitation program for individuals with brain injury is physical therapy. Unfortunately, many individuals with brain injuries in need of physical therapy do not reach high levels of independence post-injury because of their refusal to participate in these activities. Refusal of participation in phys-ical therapy activities can be conceptualized as impulsive as the individual engages in a behavior that obtains the <b>small</b> <b>immediate</b> reinforcement in the form of escape rather than a behavior that obtains a large delayed reinforcer in the form of greater independence. Strategies for teaching self-control to persons initially displaying impulsive choices have been available within behavior analysis for some time and have their empirically-validated basis in the principles of choice observed in the laboratory with nonhuman animals. For example, Grosch and Neuringer (1981) demonstrated that allowing a pigeon to peck on a disc at the back of a cage during the delay to reinforcement interval would result in increases in preference for that reinforcer over a <b>smaller</b> <b>immediate</b> reinforcer when com-pared to conditions without the availability of the disc.

40|$|Research {{into the}} future-oriented {{behaviour}} of children has largely revolved around delay of gratification. However, {{there is limited}} research exploring children’s capacity to adjust their future-oriented behaviour. This thesis investigated whether four year old children could adjust their delay behaviour in response to certainties of delayed rewards. It was predicted that children would choose to delay gratification when the certainty of receiving a delayed reward was high, and opt for an immediate reward when the chance of receiving the delayed reward was low. Children (N = 42) were presented delay choice tasks where the certainty of receiving <b>smaller,</b> <b>immediate</b> rewards or larger, delayed rewards was represented by game spinners with different chances of winning. In one instance, there was a high chance of receiving both the <b>smaller,</b> <b>immediate</b> reward and the larger, delayed reward. In the other, there was a high chance of receiving the <b>smaller,</b> <b>immediate</b> reward and a low chance of receiving the larger, delayed reward. These tasks were compared with classic delay choice tasks with a guaranteed chance of receiving either immediate or delay rewards. Results did not support that children have a capacity to rationally adjust their future-oriented behaviour. However, children’s preference for larger, delayed rewards was less {{when there was a}} low chance of receiving delay rewards compared to when there was a guaranteed chance of receiving delayed rewards. Results did not support the focal hypothesis, however, there is preliminary evidence to suggest that four year olds might take probabilistic outcomes into account when choosing between immediate and delayed rewards.

40|$|A {{preference}} for <b>smaller</b> <b>immediate</b> rewards over larger delayed rewards (delay discounting, DD) {{is common in}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD), but rarely investigated in depression. Whether this preference is due to sensitivity to reward immediacy or delay aversion remains unclear. To investigate this, we examined whether ADHD and depressive symptoms are associated with preference reversals: a switch from <b>smaller</b> <b>immediate</b> rewards to larger delayed rewards when smaller rewards are also delayed. We also examined whether these symptoms differentially affect DD of losses. In Study 1 undergraduates completed a questionnaire about ADHD symptoms, and performed a hypothetical DD task. In the NOW condition, participants were presented with choices between a small reward available today and a large reward available after one year. In the FUTURE condition both rewards were delayed with + 1 year. In Study 2 undergraduates completed questionnaires about ADHD and depressive symptoms and performed a DD task with gains and losses. Participants showed preference reversals in both studies and tasks. Losses were less steeply discounted than gains. ADHD and depressive symptoms did not influence these effects. Depressive symptoms, but not ADHD symptoms, were associated with less economic choices in general. These findings suggest that impulsive choice in depression is not explained by sensitivity to reward immediacy...|$|R
40|$|Difficulty waiting plays {{a primary}} role in {{symptoms}} of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in particular, impulsivity. Current theories suggest that relatively strong preferences for <b>small</b> <b>immediate</b> rewards as observed in ADHD-Combined type {{are the result}} of delay-related negative feelings. However, the measurement of difficulty waiting is typically limited to objective choices between <b>small</b> <b>immediate</b> and large delayed rewards. This study aimed at extending the measurement of difficulty waiting in ADHD-Combined type with ratings about subjective feelings. Children and adolescents (ages 6 - 17) with ADHD-Combined type (n= 25), ADHD-Inattentive type (n= 20) and matched typically developing participants (n= 37) performed temporal reward discounting tasks, and completed a Visual Analogue Scale of subjectively experienced ease/difficulty waiting. Although those with ADHD-Combined type demonstrated relatively steep temporal reward discounting, as reported elsewhere (Scheres et al., 2010), there were no group differences for subjectively experienced ease/difficulty waiting. Additionally, correlations between subjective and objective measures of difficulty waiting were significantly higher in the ADHD-Combined type group than in the control group. These findings suggest that (a) those with ADHD-Combined type do not choose impulsively because they have more negative feelings about waiting than controls; (b) choices in the ADHD-Combined type group are more in accordance with/driven by their feelings than choices made by participants in the control group...|$|R

Discounting describes how much the value of a reward (or punisher) is decreased when its occurrence is either delayed or uncertain. Twenty-four healthy adult volunteers ingested a moderate dose of ethanol (0. 5 or 0. 8 g/kg ethanol: n = 12 at each dose) or placebo before completing the discounting task.
