25|$|David Goldstein, a Duke University {{geneticist}} {{and director}} of the Duke Center for Human Genome Variation, has said that the work of the Technion and Ramban team served only to confirm that genetic drift {{played a major role in}} shaping Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is inherited in a matrilineal manner. Goldstein argues that the Technion and Ramban mtDNA studies fail to actually establish a statistically significant link between modern Jews and historic Middle Eastern populations. This differs from the patrilineal case, where Goldstein <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> doubt of a Middle Eastern origin.|$|E

25|$|Mail cover {{surveillance}} requests {{are granted}} for about 30 days, {{and can be}} extended for up to 120 days. Images captured under the Mail Isolation Control and Tracking program are retained for a week to 30 days and then destroyed.

Criminal activity requests average 15,000 to 20,000 per year, while the number of requests for national security mail covers has not been made public. Neither the Mail Isolation Control and Tracking program nor the mail cover program require prior approval by a judge. For both programs the information gathered is metadata from the outside of the envelope or package for which courts have <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> expectation of privacy.

25|$|Mariano's first {{experience}} with art was at fours years old with his cousin, teaching him how to draw simple shapes. He and his brother, Jonathan Ching who would also grow up to become an artist, would spend their time to draw instead of playing outside. He was greatly influenced by the anime Mazinger Z and Voltes V which was widely popular during his youth. They would significantly affect his future works. Reaching his high school years, his parents reminded him to think carefully about his life career. They <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> money in art and should consider medicine or engineering as career and to make art as a hobby. But despite his parents' constant reminder, Mariano still pursued the road of becoming an artist. He enrolled {{to a lot of}} art workshops to hone his skills. One of the workshops that he attended became the turn point of his life. At the art workshop which is headed by Elemer Borogan and Gina Morales, the art style of the paintings has touched him and made him to decide to switch from his fourth year engineering major to painting major in University of the Philippines. During his years in University of the Philippines, he co-founded the art group Surrounded by Water. There, he found his future wife, Yasmin Sison which {{is also a member of}} Surrounded by Water. Mariano Ching, at that time, was still new at the art scene and he has not garnered any recognition yet.|$|E

They also commented that the rule is too complicated, unnecessarily prescriptive, and it will cost more than necessary. Some automakers also <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> need for electric-drive vehicles to play sounds while not in motion, [...] "since {{it is not clear that}} it helps pedestrians to hear cars that are stopped in traffic or parked."

500|$|To meet {{long-term}} requirements, Alberta Transportation also {{proposes to}} construct a high capacity directional ramp carrying traffic from eastbound Anthony Henday Dive to northbound Ray Gibbon Drive after the latter is twinned and upgraded to a freeway. [...] Ray Gibbon Drive is proposed as a major corridor that will carry the Highway2 designation in the future. [...] One kilometre {{further down the road}} at 137Avenue, grading was initially completed for a partial cloverleaf interchange but in 2008 Alberta elected not to spend $7million to complete paving of the ramps because development did not yet require it. St.Albert mayor Nolan Crouse was unhappy with the decision, stating that his city would not pay for it either. [...] "It's going to sit there until there's another plan, and right now we don't have a plan... we have taken the position that we think it's the province's responsibility, and they say they won't," [...] Crouse <b>said.</b> , <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> timeline for completion of the interchange.|$|E

She sees the result as a lax attitude to drug use that helps perpetuate drug use. In 2010 she cited the US as an example of strict enforcement, stating [...] "consumption of cocaine has fallen by 75 per cent in the U.S. over the past 20 years—suggesting that the American 'war on drugs' has been rather successful." ...|$|E

2500|$|Phaedrus {{claims that}} to be a good speechmaker, one does not need to know the truth of what he is {{speaking}} on, but rather how to properly persuade, persuasion being the purpose of speechmaking and oration. Socrates first objects that an orator who does not know bad from good will, in Phaedrus's words, harvest [...] "a crop of really poor quality". Yet Socrates does not dismiss the art of speechmaking. Rather, he says, it may be that even one who knew the truth could not produce conviction without knowing the art of persuasion; on the other hand, [...] "As the Spartan <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> genuine art of speaking without a grasp of the truth, and there never will be".|$|E

Tarantino has <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> explanation for its contents— {{it is simply a}} MacGuffin, a pure plot device. Originally, the case was to contain diamonds, but this was seen as too mundane. For filming purposes, it contained a hidden orange light bulb that produced an otherworldly glow. In a 2007 video interview with fellow director and friend Robert Rodriguez, Tarantino purportedly [...] "reveals" [...] the secret contents of the briefcase, but the film cuts out and skips the scene in the style employed in Tarantino and Rodriguez's Grindhouse (2007), with an intertitle that reads [...] "Missing Reel".

Afshin had answers to all the allegations. He claimed that Zoroastrian artefacts and books in his possession were family heirlooms from before he had become Muslim. He explained that when he punished a pair of Muslim fanatics destroying idols in Ushrusanah he was exercising reasonable leadership aimed at maintaining the harmony of his religiously diverse territory. He told his detractors that the formulaic address his people used in writing to him in Persian as [...] "lord of lords", was simply a tradition and did not invalidate his personal belief in one God.|$|E

None of the detailed contemporaneous eyewitness accounts of the first inauguration mentioned that Washington had used that expression, {{and it is not}} part of the text of the inaugural oath prescribed by the Constitution. The first authors to state that Washington added the words were Rufus Wilmot Griswold in 1854 and Washington Irving in 1857. (According to the Library of Congress, the earliest documented use of that phrase during an inauguration was by President Chester Arthur, almost a century after Washington's first inauguration.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Wells {{criticized the}} infrequency of the {{reference}} to Jesus in the Pauline letters and has <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> information in them about Jesus' parents, place of birth, teachings, trial nor crucifixion. Wells also argues that Paul and the other epistle writers—the earliest Christian writers—do not provide any support for the idea that Jesus lived early in the 1st century and that—for Paul—Jesus may have existed many decades, if not centuries, before. According to Wells, the earliest strata of the New Testament literature presented Jesus as [...] "a basically supernatural personage only obscurely on Earth as a man at some unspecified period in the past". In The Jesus Myth, Wells argues that two Jesus narratives fused into one: Paul's mythical Jesus and a minimally historical Jesus whose teachings were preserved in the Q document, a hypothetical common source for the Gospels of Matthew and Luke.|$|E
2500|$|Socrates {{begins his}} legal defence {{by telling the}} jury that their minds were {{poisoned}} by his enemies, when they (the jury) were young and impressionable. That his false reputation as a sophistical philosopher comes from his enemies, {{all of whom are}} malicious and envious of him, yet must remain nameless — except for the playwright Aristophanes, who lampooned him (Socrates) as a charlatan-philosopher in the comedy play The Clouds (423 BC). About corrupting the rich, young men of Athens, Socrates argues that deliberate corruption is an illogical action. That the false accusations of his being a corrupter of youth began {{at the time of his}} obedience to the Oracle at Delphi, and tells how Chaerephon went to the Oracle, to ask her (the priestess) if there was a man wiser than Socrates. That when Chaerephon reported to him that the Oracle <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> wiser man, he (Socrates) interpreted that divine report as a riddle — because he was aware of possessing no wisdom [...] "great or small", and that lying is not in the nature of the gods.|$|E
