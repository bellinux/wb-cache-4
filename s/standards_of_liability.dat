40|$|An {{important}} issue in Taiwan today concerns the rising tension between strict liability and negligence. Article 191 - 3 of the Civil Code of Taiwan imposes a fault-based <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> on persons conducting dangerous activities. On the other hand, {{the majority of}} scholars believe that to afford greater protection, this rule should be changed into a strict liability rule. Traditionally, three arguments make it preferable to impose strict liability under certain circumstances. First, strict liability induces more safety incentives {{on the part of}} the defendant. Second, fairness requires that one who benefits from conducting dangerous activities should bear the risk of loss. Finally, the defendant is better able to spread the loss to the general public. However, based on the analysis of each justification, this Dissertation finds that all of these arguments fail. Accordingly, this Dissertation argues that intermediate liability, a variation under negligence principles, is a proper <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> when high risk of harm is involved;—i. e. Article 191 - 3 is proper in imposing fault-based liability to dangerous activities—for the following three reasons: 1) intermediate liability provides additional safety incentives by shifting the burden of proof to the defendant; 2) it conforms to fairness; and 3) it does not consider tort law as a means of insurance...|$|R

40|$|Public {{enforcement}} of the Clean Water Act (CWA) has been characterized by {{the increased use of}} criminal sanctions over the past decade. This sanctioning trend has developed in direct response to the passage of the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) as part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. New sentencing guidelines were established in 1987 under which courts were required to impose sentences which reflect the seriousness of the offense, provide just punishment for the offense, and afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct. Legal trends are documented for both industrial and agricultural violations as a result of applying the new federal sentencing guidelines to CWA cases.

40|$|The Supreme Court’s 1911 {{decision}} in Standard Oil gave us embryonic versions of two foundational <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> under the Sherman Act: {{the rule of}} reason under Section 1 and the monopoly power/exclusionary conduct test under Section 2. But a case filed later in 1911, United States v. United States Steel Corporation, shaped the understanding of Standard Oil’s <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> for decades. U. S. Steel, eventually decided by the Supreme Court in 1920, upheld the 1901 merger that created 2 ̆ 2 the Corporation, 2 ̆ 2 as U. S. Steel was known. The majority found that {{the efforts of the}} Corporation and its rivals to control prices in the famous Gary dinners had violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act when they occurred, but paradoxically insulated U. S. Steel from liability under Section 2. U. S. Steel was formed to monopolize the industry, but failed; it demonstrated its impotence by fixing prices with rivals instead of crushing them, as Standard Oil had done. U. S. Steel’s interpretation and application of Standard Oil essentially ended governmental enforcement of section 2 until Alcoa. Economic scholars suggest that the case ratified “the most socially damaging of all mergers in U. S. history” and caused lasting harm to the American economy by making the crucial steel industry less competitive. Equally important, I argue in this essay, it harmed antitrust doctrine. In cases like Alcoa, it played a role in confusing in the law of monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Moreover, by rendering Section 1 of the Sherman ineffective against monopolistic mergers, it contributed to the passage of Cellar-Kefauver Act’s amendment of Section 7 of the Clayton Act in 1950 and, indirectly, to the early misguided interpretations of that provision in cases like Brown Shoe and Von’s. In this essay, I will describe errors of U. S. Steel, the mistaken responses to those errors in post-New Deal antitrust, and role of competing ideologies in both. In a final Part, I argue that modern reforms should assure that both U. S. Steel’s errors and the excesses of the post-New Deal antitrust will not recur...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between two concepts found throughout the law <b>of</b> products <b>liability,</b> defect and negligence. Traditional tort doctrine contends that, although they are sometimes used interchangeably, both concepts refer to quite distinct matters: the state of a product, on the one hand, {{and the nature of}} a manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s conduct in supplying its products, on the other. The hallmark distinction between a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> fault and one <b>of</b> strict <b>liability,</b> it is said, is that only the former requires proof of unreasonable care, whereas both require proof of a defect. Relying on developments in the United States and in Canada, the author suggests that such claims are overly sweeping in practice. In both jurisdictions, while a decisionmaker can focus exclusively on an outcome (the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s product) and ignore the reasons given for this result (the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s conduct) in determining whether or not a manufacturing defect is present, negligence concepts such as cost-benefit balancing and foreseeability of risk appear inseparable from inquiries into the defectiveness of a design or warning. Regardless <b>of</b> the <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> adopted in theory, defect and negligence thus converge in two important areas <b>of</b> products <b>liability.</b> The author reviews policy considerations and two recent appellate court decisions supporting a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> strict <b>liability</b> tailored to manufacturing defects. In his view, aprina fade case for manufacturer liability should exist when a plaintiff demonstrates (1) that a product is dangerously different from its intended design, (2) that the defendant is responsible for the defective product 2 ̆ 7 s supply, and (3) that recognized damages were caused by this defect. Pursuant to their power and their duty to ensure the incremental evolution of the common law, it is argued, Canadian courts ought to openly recognize a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> strict tort <b>liability</b> for manufacturing defects...|$|R

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the Great Depression, the federal {{securities}} laws operated to mandate disclosure of material facts to investors and extend broad private remedies to victims of securities fraudfeasors. The revelation of massive securities fraud underlying the Great Depression animated the federal securities laws as investment plunged after 1929 and failed to recover for years. For over sixty years after the enactment of the federal securities laws, no episode of massive securities fraud with significant macroeconomic harm occurred. The federal securities laws thereby operated to facilitate financial stability and prosperity, in addition to a superior allocation of capital. Unfortunately, as memories faded and inequality soared, corporate and financial elites (with the active aid of lawmakers) launched a sustained attack upon private enforcement of the securities laws. Soon thereafter the horrors of the Great Depression returned and massive securities fraud triggered the Great Recession of 2008 as economists predicted. This Article argues for a rollback of the war on private securities litigation to at least the 1980 s based upon history and economic science. This would at least restore sensible pleading standards, impose liability on all participants in securities frauds (including aiders and abettors) and allow the states to impose more demanding <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> on wrongdoers in financial markets...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{addresses}} {{in simple}} analytic terms the strong allegations {{of recent years}} that various features of our modern legal system—an oversupply of lawyers, increased litigiousness, expanded <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability,</b> and growth in governmental regulation—have reduced economic growth and harmed American competitiveness in foreign and domestic trade. Over the past few years, steadily accelerating complaints have been raised about lawyers and about the structure and substance of American law, especially modern tort and environmental law. It is well known that, {{over the past three}} decades, the absolute number of lawyers and the proportion of lawyers per capita have increased substantially in the United States. Over the same period, courts have significantly expanded standards of tort and environmental liability, increasing the liability exposure of virtually everyone in the society, but especially of manufacturers, insurers and governmental entities. Similarly, both state and federal governments have expanded direct regulation of the environment and, in more limited cases, of safety with respect to specific products. These legal developments have increased insurance costs and non-insured liability payouts as well as the costs of regulatory compliance. Not surprisingly, there has been increasing criticism of lawyers and serious opposition to the developing direction of the law. The most outspoken critics claim variously that the expansion of liability and regulation levies a huge tax on American enterprise, reduces economic growth, and, more generally, diminishes U. S. trade competitiveness. Lawyers, obviously, are the instruments through which this damage is inflicted...|$|E
40|$|Economic theory {{provides}} a coherent framework for analysing {{the elements of}} growth and sustainable development. Robust policies and appropriate institutional structures are essential to achieving sustainable development. Environmental problems are rooted in failed markets and their resolution requires government taking some kind of action – to establish property rights, set <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability,</b> apply polluter pays taxes, or regulate. There is ample evidence showing that market based instruments can achieve the same environmental outcome at considerably less cost relative to command and control. Rational policy must seriously consider the use of market-based instruments. A framework for considering the quality of institutional structures vis-à-vis achieving sustainable development is presented. The framework is applied to aspects of the Resource Management Act 1991. Although the Act aims to promote sustainable management it is the primary legal foundation for sustainable development policy. One result of the Act was to devolve {{a great deal of}} environmental management and policy to local government. To a limited extent the Act is permissive and creates opportunities for local and regional government to find effective and efficient ways of achieving environmental outcomes that suit their communities. There is a clear preference for command and control in situations where statute {{provides a}} legal framework for market based instruments. But the options for using market-based instruments are limited. There are instances where attempts by regional administrators to implement market-based instruments are thwarted either by statute or by coordination difficulties at higher levels of government.

Fire is a constant threat to America’s forests and is capable of doing enormous damage to critical ecological systems. Yet the legal ramifications of forest fires are often determined by state law, which leads to doctrinal inconsistency. Recently, the U. S.

Other states, by contrast, limit the types of damages that the government can claim. The <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> for forest fires can be similarly ambiguous.
