5|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the first Sphecomyrma fossils, there were no fossil records of any ants from Cretaceous amber and the oldest social insects at the time extended back to the Eocene epoch; the earliest known ant at the time was described from a forewing found in the Claiborne Formation in Tennessee. The great diversity of ant fossils found in the Baltic amber and Florissant shales of the Oligocene and in the Sicilian amber of the Miocene have prompted entomologists to search for ants of Cretaceous age that may link ants and non-social wasps together. Such a link may shed light on the early origins of ants, but no fossils of any social insect existed before S. freyi was discovered, thus the early evolution of ants remained a mystery. Only a single hymenopterous Upper Cretaceous fossil {{has been the subject of}} possible significance to the evolution of aculeate wasps and ants. A single forewing was discovered in Siberia and described in 1957 as Cretavus sibiricus, with the author noting that the wing ventation closely resembles those of bethylid or scoliid wasps, of which these families of wasps have close connections with the origin of ants. However, there were several problems: as the fossil was only a <b>single</b> <b>wing,</b> scientists could not explain or answer whether or not the insect had key diagnostic body traits that would even place it within the subclade Aculeata.|$|E

In 1969, this dinosaur was described and named Deinonychus by John Ostrom of Yale University. The next year, Ostrom redescribed a specimen of Pterodactylus in the Dutch Teyler Museum as another skeleton of Archaeopteryx. The specimen consisted mainly of a <b>single</b> <b>wing</b> and its description made Ostrom aware of {{the similarities between the}} wrists of Archaeopteryx and Deinonychus.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Continental Air Command assumed {{responsibility}} from ADC {{for managing}} Air National Guard and reserve units. When the regular Air Force implemented the wing base organization system, which placed operational and support units on a base under a <b>single</b> <b>wing</b> that same year, the 307th Wing, {{along with other}} reserve wings {{with more than one}} combat group assigned, was renamed an air division. In the case of the 307th, this also prevented confusion with the regular 307th Bombardment Wing, which was organized at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida in August 1947.|$|E
25|$|To improve survivability, the French Air Force began {{dispersing}} Mirage IVs to pre-prepared rough strips {{during the}} 1960s; while {{the use of}} hardened bunkers had been assessed, it {{was found to be}} financially impractical. By the 1970s, it had become clear that vulnerability of the Mirage IV to air defences, even while flying at low altitudes, had made the delivery of gravity bombs such as the AN-11 or AN-22 impractical. Thus, it was decided to pass a greater share of the deterrent role onto land-based IRBMs and submarine-based missiles alternatives; as a result, a <b>single</b> <b>wing</b> of Mirage IVs was stood down in 1976, partially due to fleet-wide attrition losses.|$|E
25|$|In October 1960, the 379th wing {{began to}} {{transfer}} its aircraft to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base for storage {{in preparation for}} a move on paper to Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan and reassignment to another division. Although the 823d was originally scheculed to inactivate with only a <b>single</b> <b>wing</b> left at Homestead, by the time the 379th's move occurred in January 1961 the division instead began preparations for a new role as the command element for dispersed bombardment wings, which would include four bombardment wings at four locations by the end of 1961. The 306th Bombardment Wing at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida and 321st Bombardment Wing at McCoy Air Force Base, Florida were assigned to the wing in early February and the 2d Bombardment Wing at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia became the division's fourth wing in April.|$|E

25|$|In {{the higher}} groups with two {{functional}} pairs of wings, both pairs are linked together mechanically in various ways, and {{function as a}} <b>single</b> <b>wing,</b> although {{this is not true}} in the more primitive groups. There are also exceptions to be found among the more advanced Neoptera; the ghost moth is able to unlock its pair of wings and move them independently, allowing them to hover like dragonflies. What all Neoptera share, however, is the way the muscles in the thorax work: these muscles, rather than attaching to the wings, attach to the thorax and deform it; since the wings are extensions of the thoracic exoskeleton, the deformations of the thorax cause the wings to move as well. A set of dorsal longitudinal muscles compress the thorax from front to back, causing the dorsal surface of the thorax (notum) to bow upward, making the wings flip down. A set of tergosternal muscles pull the notum downward again, causing the wings to flip upward.|$|E
25|$|In September 1941, the Army Air Forces {{plans for}} war against Germany and Japan {{proposed}} basing the B-29 in Egypt for operations against Germany as British airbases {{were likely to}} be overcrowded. Air Force planning throughout 1942 and early 1943 continued to have the B-29 deployed initially against Germany, only transferring to the Pacific {{after the end of the}} war in Europe. By the end of 1943, however, plans had changed, partly due to production delays, and the B-29 was dedicated to the Pacific Theater. A new plan implemented at the direction of President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a promise to China, called Operation Matterhorn, deployed the B-29 units to attack Japan from four forward bases in southern China, with five main bases in India, and to attack other targets in the region from China and India as needed. The Chengdu region was eventually chosen over the Guilin region to avoid having to raise, equip, and train 50 Chinese divisions to protect the advanced bases from Japanese ground attack. The XX Bomber Command, initially intended to be two combat wings of four groups each, was reduced to a <b>single</b> <b>wing</b> of four groups because of the lack of availability of aircraft, automatically limiting the effectiveness of any attacks from China.|$|E
