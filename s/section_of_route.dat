5|$|Prior {{to turning}} onto Rutgers Street, CR-506 runs along Washington Street {{concurrent}} {{with the northern}} <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 7. Though the northern <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 7 begins a few blocks south, it is not readily recognized (minimal signing). As CR-506 runs concurrently with it here, and then turns down Rutgers for the short distance that bridges {{the gap between the}} two Route 7 sections, Rutgers/506 is often viewed as if it continues Route 7, while the short portion of the northern section that lies south of Rutgers is sometimes seen as a spur, even though {{it is part of the}} main route.|$|E
5|$|The second <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 7, {{designated}} a northsouth road, heads north on Washington Avenue from the Second River crossing on the Newark/Belleville border, {{passing through a}} business district. The route intersects County Route 506 (Belleville Avenue), and that county route then forms a concurrency with Route 7 along the next block of Washington Avenue, to the intersection with Rutgers Street. At that point, County Route 506 heads to the east, ending {{at the intersection of}} Main Street, Rutgers Street, and bridge to Belleville (which is also the other <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 7).|$|E

5|$|The {{intersection}} of Main St and Rutgers Street in Belleville forms {{the end of}} one <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 7 (signed north, directionally west). Rutgers Street is named for Colonel Henry Rutgers, an American Revolutionary War hero and benefactor of what is now Rutgers University.

5|$|The {{southern}} <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 7, {{which runs}} from Jersey City to Belleville, passes through industrial areas, the New Jersey Meadowlands, Arlington Memorial Park, and some residential and business areas. West of the interchange with County Route 508 in Kearny, Route 7 is the Belleville Turnpike, a historic road created in 1759. The northern <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 7 runs north through residential and business areas of Belleville and Nutley into Clifton, where it turns west and crosses back into Nutley, briefly {{turning to the}} north to come to its northern terminus. A portion of the route in Nutley is municipally maintained while the portion within Clifton is maintained by Passaic County. The two separate sections of Route 7 are linked by County Route 506 (Rutgers Street) in Belleville, which is signed as Route 7 despite the fact it is not officially part of the route.|$|E
5|$|Past this intersection, County Route 507 {{turns away}} from Route 7, {{becoming}} concurrent with Route 17. by heading north on River Road, while Route 7 continues along Bellevill Turnpike for another half mile, Route 7 continues another half mile west, crossing the Passaic River on a lift bridge, known as the Belleville Turnpike Bridge or Rutgers Street Bridge, into Belleville, Essex County, where the local street name changes from Belleville Turnpike to Rutgers Street. The first <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 7 ends at an intersection with Main Street underneath Route 21.|$|E

5|$|The last OE {{service to}} this station {{operated}} on June 19, 1931, {{after the company}} requested, and received, permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon that <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> because of declining ridership and worsening traffic congestion. The service was cut back to Front and Jefferson streets the following day, and OE moved its ticket office to that location. The tracks along 10th and Salmon streets were abandoned and soon removed. Just two years later, in May 1933, the Oregon Electric discontinued all its remaining passenger service, becoming exclusively a freight railroad.|$|E

Route 54 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 14,866 vehicles at the Old Stage Road intersection in Delmar to a low of 1,464 vehicles at the Parker Road intersection west of Selbyville. None of Route 54 is part of the National Highway System.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, {{the routes}} were redefined. Route 6 {{would be a}} {{completely}} new alignment from Paterson to the George Washington Bridge, and Route 5 would only run east from Route 1 (Broad Avenue, now U.S. Route 1/9) in Ridgefield. The alignment of Route 10 west of Ridgefield was designated Route 10N until it was eventually {{turned over to the}} county. Route 5 retained its routing in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. By the 2000s, the <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 5 along River Road to the former ferry was removed. In June 2007, construction began on a $24.6 million project to improve the route through Palisades Park. This project, which is to be completed later in 2009, will involve the replacement of the bridge over Delia Avenue, the removal of a bridge over an abandoned rail line, and the widening of the two-lane road to include a shoulder.|$|E

5|$|In the 1927 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways, Route 8 was defined to run along present-day Route 94 from Route 6 (current US 46) at the Delaware Bridge north to Columbia before turning northeast to Route 31 (now U.S. Route 206) in Newton. Past Newton, Route 31 continued northeast to the New York state line (current US 206 {{north of here}} was Route S31). In the original version of the renumbering bill, Route 31 was to reach the border via Sussex, incorporating pre-1927 Route 8 (now Route 284) from Sussex to the state line. However, in the final version, Route 31 ran via Hamburg, using the same alignment as a planned spur of pre-1927 Route 8 from Lafayette to North Church. Route 8 was eventually {{taken over by the}} state. On the other hand, by 1949, only one <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 31 north of the Route S31 split had been taken between North Church to Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|Route 108 was {{designated}} in 1930, connecting {{from the state}} line to Route 25. The road was already paved in gravel. Three years later, Route Y {{was designated}}, and it connected from Route 108 in Arbyth to Caruth. In 1936, Route 108 was repaved in concrete. By 1953, Route 25 was rerouted into Arbyrd, becoming the terminus of Routes 108 and Y there. Route 164 was designated in 1956, replacing a large <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> Y from Route 108 to Route N. Fifteen years later, Route 25 was rerouted to the west, and the old alignment, from Route 246, through Arbyrd, became part of Route 108. Around 1983, US 412 was designated, replacing Route 25 from Kennett to the state line.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 7 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 1-9 Truck and County Route 645 (Charlotte Avenue) in Jersey City, Hudson County, {{heading to the}} west on a four-lane highway that is signed eastwest. The route crosses the Hackensack River on the Wittpenn Bridge into Kearny. Route 7 interchanges with County Route 659 (Fish House Road) and widens to a six-lane divided highway. The route than passes by industrial areas and a railroad yard and then interchanges with County Route 508. Past this interchange, Route 7 becomes the four-lane, divided Belleville Turnpike, with {{the eastern end of}} the Newark Turnpike running in the division between the two sides of Route 7. It then becomes an undivided two-lane road, heading northwest, narrowing to two lanes before it passes through the New Jersey Meadowlands, under the mainline of the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) and then the western spur of the New Jersey Turnpike a short distance later.|$|E

5|$|MD 5 was {{designated}} in 1927 {{to the state}} highway between north of Point Lookout and the Washington, D.C. border, passing through Leonardtown, Hughesville, and Waldorf. MD 5 ran concurrent with MD 3 (now US 301) between Waldorf and TB. In 1928, the route was paved between north of TB and Camp Springs. By 1933, MD 5 was paved between northwest of Leonardtown and north of Morganza and along the MD 3 concurrency between Waldorf and the Charles-Prince George's county border. Also, the route was extended south along an unpaved road into Point Lookout State Park. In 1939, MD 5 was rerouted to follow Naylor Road to the Washington, D.C. border while the portion of Branch Avenue leading to the border {{was designated}} as MD 637. DC 5 continued into Washington, D.C. along Naylor Road, Good Hope Road, and 11th Street SE to DC 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue SE). By this time, the <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> between Hughesville and Waldorf was paved while the section between Point Lookout and Leonardtown was a bituminous road. By 1946, MD 5 was paved between Great Mills and Leonardtown. Also, DC 5 was extended to follow DC 4 along Pennsylvania Avenue to US 1 and US 240 at {{the east side of}} the White House. In 1949, the DC 5 designation was decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|Route 21 heads {{north from}} the Newark Airport Interchange with U.S. Route 1/9 and U.S. Route 22 in Newark near the Newark Liberty International Airport on the six-lane, divided McCarter Highway. This portion of Route 21 serves to connect Newark Liberty with {{downtown}} Newark. The route interchanges with Interstate 78 and then crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor rail line on a viaduct, {{coming to an}} interchange with Broad Street that provides access to Route 27. The route continues north, paralleling the elevated Northeast Corridor tracks that lead up to Newark Penn Station, which serves Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains. At the Emmet Street intersection, Route 21 becomes a four-lane, undivided road and intersects Murray Street, which provides access to the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark. This <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 21 through {{the southern part of}} Newark has a high accident rate due to the heavy concentration of businesses and traffic lights along this portion of road. The road widens to six lanes and the route intersects County Route 510 (Market Street) near Newark Penn Station and continues north into downtown Newark, splitting from the Northeast Corridor rail line. It crosses Raymond Boulevard and the route meets County Route 508 (Center Street), with which it forms a concurrency.|$|E
5|$|Route 3 was {{originally}} established in 1927 {{to run from}} the New York border on the west shore of Greenwood Lake to Secaucus. In 1929, the western terminus was cut back to Paterson when the alignment west of there was planned {{to become part of}} Route S4B. Route 3 originally followed present-day Route 20 through Paterson and ran along local streets to East Rutherford, where it followed present-day Route 120 and the Paterson Plank Road to Secaucus. It was extended east to the Lincoln Tunnel in 1939. The freeway <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 3 between U.S. Route 46 in Clifton and East Rutherford was completed in the 1940s as Route S3 as well as the Secaucus Bypass, which was designated a bypass of Route 3. Route 3 was moved to the Route S3 freeway and the Secaucus Bypass in 1953 and was truncated to U.S. Route 1/9 in North Bergen in 1959 when the Lincoln Tunnel approach was designated as Interstate 495. The Route 3 freeway has seen many improvements over the years such as widening and interchange reconstructions. It underwent a major reconstruction, completed in 2016, to modern highway standards with bridge replacements, including a new Passaic River bridge between Clifton and Route 17 in Rutherford.|$|E
