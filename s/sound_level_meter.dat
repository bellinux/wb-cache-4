25|$|A Weighting {{curve is}} a graph {{of a set}} of factors, that are used to 'weight' {{measured}} values of a variable according to their importance in relation to some outcome. An important example is frequency weighting in sound level measurement where a specific set of weighting curves known as A, B, C and D weighting as defined in IEC 61672 are used. Unweighted measurements of sound pressure do not correspond to perceived loudness because the human ear is less sensitive at low and high frequencies, with the effect more pronounced at lower sound levels. The four curves are applied to the measured sound level, for example by the use of a weighting filter in a <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter,</b> to arrive at readings of loudness in Phons or in decibels (dB) above the threshold of hearing. (see A-weighting).|$|E

This change was needed as each <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> manufacturer could choose their own low and high frequency cut-offs (3dB) points, resulting in different readings, especially when peak sound level was being measured. As well, the C-frequency-weighting, with 3dB points at 31.5Hz and 8kHz did not have a sufficient bandpass to allow the sensibly correct measurement of true peak noise (Lpk) ...|$|E

40|$|Occupational noise {{exposure}} measurements are usually conducted using a measurement methodology based on <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meters</b> or noise dosimeters. Various researchers {{have examined the}} relative accuracies of these instruments in both laboratory and field studies: however, a paucity of data exists as to their absolute accuracies {{in relationship to the}} reference position.

50|$|The {{standard}} <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> can {{be called}} an exponentially averaging <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> as the AC signal from the microphone is converted to DC by a root-mean-square (RMS) circuit and thus it must have a time constant of integration; today {{referred to as the}} time-weighting. Three of these time-weightings have been internationally standardized, 'S' (1 s) originally called Slow, 'F' (125 ms) originally called Fast and 'I' (35 ms) originally called Impulse. Their names were changed in the 1980s to be the same in any language. I-time-weighting is no longer {{in the body of the}} standard because it has little real correlation with the impulsive character of noise events.|$|E

Music is complex, and constantly varying, with brief peaks originating from many sources including the initial impact of sticks on cymbals and drums.

40|$|AbstractMaximum <b>sound</b> {{pressure}} <b>levels</b> {{are commonly}} used for environmental noise and building acoustics measurements. This paper investigates the signal processing errors due to Fast or Slow time-weighting detectors when combined with octave band filters, one-third octave band filters or an A-weighting filter. For 6 th order Butterworth CPB filters the inherent time delay caused by the phase response of filters is quantified using three different approaches to establish the following rules-of-thumb: (1) time-to-gradient/amplitude matching occurs when Bt≈ 1, (2) time-to-peak matching occurs when Bt≈ 2 and (3) time-to-settle matching occurs when Bt≈ 4 for octave band filters, and when Bt≈ 3 for one-third octave band filters. Four different commercially-available <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meters</b> are used to quantify the variation in measured maximum levels using tone bursts, half-sine pulses, ramped noise and recorded transients. Tone bursts indicate that Slow time-weighting is inappropriate for maximum level measurements due to the large bias error. The results also {{show that there is}} more variation between <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meters</b> when considering Fast time-weighted maximum levels in octave bands or one-third octave bands than with A-weighted levels. To reduce the variation between measurements with different <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meters,</b> it is proposed that limits could be prescribed on the phase response for CPB filters and A-weighting filters...|$|R
