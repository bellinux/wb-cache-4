50|$|A characteristic, {{specialised}} insect fauna {{is found}} on glucosinolate-containing plants, including familiar butterflies such as large white, small white, and orange tip, but also certain <b>aphids,</b> <b>moths,</b> saw flies, flea beetles, etc. For instance, the {{large white butterfly}} oviposits its eggs on these glucosinolate-containing plants because they help the larvae survive. The biochemical basis of these specialisations are being unraveled. The whites and orange tips all possess the so-called nitrile specifier protein, which diverts glucosinolate hydrolysis toward nitriles rather than reactive isothiocyanates. In contrast, the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) possesses a completely different protein, glucosinolate sulfatase, which desulfates glucosinolates, thereby making them unfit for degradation to toxic products by myrosinase.|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} defoliating pest of Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis in the U. K. is the green <b>spruce</b> <b>aphid</b> Elatobium abietinum. This aphid species {{is expected to}} respond to a predicted increase in the incidence of spring–summer drought events, with serious implications for growth of infested spruce plants and control of the pest. Growth rate, adult weight and nymph weight of E. abietinum were assessed under controlled laboratory conditions, using five levels of spring–summer drought of differing intensities and frequencies. Trials were time-staggered to investigate changes through season. Growth rate, adult weight and nymph weight were consistently increased under low amplitude intermittent drought stress, suggesting improved host nutritional quality through the year and increased fecundity. A complex response under severe and low amplitude intermittent drought stress was also observed, mediated by season. Although an overall reduction in host quality was typically observed, continuous severe stress improved host quality during the autumn. Despite this, the onset of dormancy was unaffected.

40|$|Climate {{change in}} the UK is {{predicted}} to increase both winter temperatures {{and the frequency of}} summer drought events. Elatobium abietinum, the green <b>spruce</b> <b>aphid,</b> is the most important defoliating pest of Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis, a conifer very widely used in British forest industry. This aphid is expected to respond strongly to altered climate, with changes to population densities leading to more frequent serious outbreaks and defoliation. The impact of simulated spring–summer drought on the reproductive performance of E. abietinum was investigated under laboratory conditions. Rates were assessed under five drought treatments of differing frequencies and intensities to characterize the direction of responses under different drought scenarios, and in time-staggered trials to explore seasonal variation. Variation in the response of reproduction to water deficit was mediated by drought frequency and magnitude. Low-amplitude, moderate intermittent stress improved reproductive rates, while severe stress, both continuous and high-amplitude intermittent, had a detrimental impact when compared with observations made on well-watered controls. Season was also found to modify the response, with improvements to plant nutritional quality under high-amplitude stress reflected by improving reproduction. Despite this, no differences in rates were found during the autumn, suggesting no advancement in spruce dormancy under drought. Drought stress therefore has the potential to alter E. abietinum population densities, structure and phenology in Sitka spruce plantations, with implications for forest management, damage levels and natural control of the aphid under future altered climate...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} between plants and insects are mediated by volatile molecules. Plants respond to stress by biosynthesis of chemical substances which can deter invading insects or pathogens. Some of these substances are volatile and are emitted to the surroundings and may attract or repel insects. Information about the susceptibility of individual plants to infestation, their volatile emissions and chemical defence is of interest, {{for example in}} selecting plants for tree breeding programs. This research was focused on finding volatile chemical markers of resistance in Norway spruce plants that do influence insects associated to conifers. Collection of headspace volatiles by SPME followed by separation and identification with GC-MS is effective in investigating biological systems {{with a minimum of}} disturbance. This method has here been used to investigate Norway spruce plants of different ages and stress conditions as well as trapping semiochemicals like nepetalactone emitted by the <b>spruce</b> shoot <b>aphids.</b> It was even possible to analyse the emission of single needles in vivo and obtain a chemical pattern of the site of the stress reaction. Seedlings of different ages showed differences in chemical composition of emitted volatiles, with the pine weevil repellent (S) -(-) -limonene as one of the main compounds. Wounded phloem of conventional plants emitted high amounts of monoterpenes while the phloem of mini plants emitted (3 Z) -hexenal and (3 Z) -hexen- 1 -ol. Norway spruce plants did respond to different stress elicitors with similar response, regardless of their genetic origin. The emissions from stressed Norway spruce plants mainly consist of (E) -β-farnesene, (E,E) -α-farnesene, (E) -α-bisabolene, (R) -(-) -linalool and methyl salicylate.

40|$|The green <b>spruce</b> <b>aphid,</b> Elatobium abietinum (Walker) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is {{the most}} {{important}} defoliating pest of Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr., in the U. K. Currently, populations of this aphid are limited by freezing periods in the winter, while interactions between climate and other factors regulate population dynamics. Climate change in the U. K. is predicted to result in: (1) warmer winters, improving overwinter survival by aphid populations, and (2) an increase in hot and dry summers, likely to place Sitka spruce under drought stress. These could promote aphid densities and increased damage to the trees, resulting in losses to plant growth and productivity. Few studies have been conducted on the effect of drought stress on arboreal herbivores. This project sought to explore the effects of different intensities of spring-summer drought stress on E. abietinum on Sitka spruce. Populations and their effects on their host plant, in terms of needle retention and impact on tree growth, were observed in a semi-field nursery setting. The performance of individual aphids was also observed under controlled conditions at intervals following bud-burst in spring, and again in autumn. Finally, a study was conducted on the consumption rates of specialist and generalist Coccinellid predators feeding on aphids reared under differing drought intensities. Elatobium abietinum exhibited an overall positive response to moderate intermittent drought stress, while severe stress was typically detrimental. When considered with aphid size, Coccinellid predator consumption rates reflected these findings. Changes to damage levels on Sitka spruce can therefore be expected under drought stress; increases are likely under moderate intermittent stress, though the nature of changes under severe stress levels remain unclear. The results revealed complex interactions between drought stress, E. abietinum and Sitka spruce. Given the potential impact of the aphid, {{it is important to understand}} the possible responses under climate change. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Continuous cover {{forestry}} (CCF), {{an alternative}} forest management approach to clearfelling, is increasingly being {{adopted in the}} UK. It aims at enhancing stand structural diversity and favouring natural regeneration and subsequent seedling growth below the existing canopy of plantation forests. One area of limited knowledge is the critical level of below-canopy light {{for the growth of}} naturally regenerating seedlings. In addition, plant growth beneath canopies is influenced by other factors (e. g. herbivory). Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. (Sitka spruce) seedlings under canopies have been observed to be severely damaged by Elatobium abietinum (Walker) (green <b>spruce</b> <b>aphid)</b> attacks. The combined effects of light availability and insect attack on seedling growth are not well understood, however, this understanding is crucial in order to ensure successful management of regeneration within CCF systems. A controlled experiment, which mimicked different natural understorey light levels along with repeated artificial aphid infestation, was conducted over two years to look at seedling performance through structural and physiological (chlorophyll fluorescence) measurements. Aphid population assessments showed significant increased population density under shaded conditions. Nevertheless, aphid impacts were mainly localised in extent while the impact of light was the major component that described seedling growth. Light was the primary factor affecting the whole-plant biomass, whereas aphids had only localised effects on the total dry weight of older needles and roots, and on leader extension growth. A significant interaction between light levels and presence/absence of aphid infestation was found for main leader extension growth of the seedlings during the second year of the experiment, with lower values at low light levels under infestation. Plant biomass allocation was affected strongly by light, while aphid presence did not result in significant changes. At the leaf physiologylevel, the light environment was found to be the main driving factor affecting photosynthetic response, whilst aphid presence had only a short-term localised effect on photosynthesis. The impact of light levels and aphid presence on seedling growth were also determined at an experimental field site where plots were located across two light regimes typical of CCF conditions in upland UK coniferous forests. The comparison of the photosynthetic response of the seedlings in both the controlled and field experiment highlighted the importance of considering the temporal heterogeneity of the light environment experienced by understorey seedlings in CCF stands, while aphid and aphid x light interaction effects could not be determined due to very low aphid levels during the year. Finally, a pre-existing light model was parameterised to predict the understorey light environment required to promote successful seedling growth in CCF stands. Sensitivity and validation analyses were also performed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensisi {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely planted forest trees in the UK and and its high timber yields make it a commercially {{important}} species. The green <b>spruce</b> <b>aphid</b> Elatobium abietinum is a serious defoliating pest of Sitka spruce, and has been shown to have a significant impact on productivity. Little is known about how future changes in forest management will affect the abundnace, and hence impact, of this pest. This study set out to compare aphid performance and populations on trees of different ages, in stands under varying forms of forest management, and to try to identify the most important factors responsible for variation in aphid abundance. The results of this research highlighted key differences in aphid abundance with respect to variations in tree age and forest stand structure. These patters appeared to be linked with a number of biotic and abiotic factors, including foliage suitability, the level of shade within forest plots, canopy temperature and the abundance of certain natural enemies. Population densities of E. abietinum in the field were significantly higher on young regenerating trees growing in shaded environments compared with light environments. In addition, aphids reared on potted plants achieved a significantly higher growth rate when reared on trees grown under high levels of shade compared with lower levels of shade, a trend which was not explained by differences in the percentage dry weight of nitrogen in needles. Exposure to high temperatures (above 25 °C) was detrimental to the individual performance (in terms of growth rate and survival) of E. abietinum. A significant negative relationship was detected between populations of aphidophagous syrphids and peak populations of E. abietinum implying that these predators may play an important role in suppressing aphid densities. Alternatives to the traditional "clearfell and replant" approach to forest management can influence the abundance, and hence impact, of E. abietinum. Forests managed under the uniform shelterwood system supported large aphid populations, whereas the group selection system of forest management, which gives rise to a highly structurally diverse forest, with a high frequency of canopy gaps (increasing light penetration), and high level of ground flora (enhancing certain natural enemy groups including hoverflies), my offer benefits in terms of reduced aphid populations. The findings of this study will have important applications in the future management of commercial Sitka spruce forests in the UK, and will enable more accurate predications to be made of the threat posed by this damaging pest in the future.

Evidence is accumulating that climate change is having {{a significant effect on}} a wide range of organisms spanning the full range of biodiversity found on this planet. This study investigates the ecological role of climate change, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and habitat change on British insect populations. Despite the NAO having a considerable effect on British weather, the role of the NAO on British insects has not previously been studied in great detail. The World's two best entomological time series datasets were used – the United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) and the Rothamsted Insect Survey of aphids – both surveys with very large sample sizes and high quality data. Summary of main findings: 1. Warm weather associated with a positive NAO index caused the spring migration of the green <b>spruce</b> <b>aphid</b> (Elatobium abietinum), a pest species of spruce trees (Picea) to start earlier, continue for longer and contain more aphids. An upward trend in the NAO index during the period 1966 - 2006 is associated with an increasing population size of E. abietinum. 2. The NAO does not affect the overall UK butterfly population size. However, the abundance of bivoltine butterfly species, which have a longer flight season, were more likely to respond positively to the NAO compared to univoltine species, which show little or a negative response. 3. A positive winter NAO index was associated with warmer weather and earlier butterfly flight dates. For bivoltine (two generations in a year) species, the NAO affects the phenology of the first generation, and then the timing of the second generation is indirectly controlled by the timing of the first generation. The NAO influences the timing of the butterfly flight seasons more strongly than it influences population size. 4. Butterfly data from Monks Wood National Nature Reserve in Cambridgeshire showed that the NAO does not affect the abundance of the whole butterfly community, but it does affect the population size of some species. The NAO does not affect butterfly diversity, but there were decreases in butterfly diversity and number of species with time. 5. The total number of butterflies counted at Monks Wood was constant for most of the time series. However, the population size of the ringlet (Aphantopus hyperantus) increased from very low numbers to more than half the total number of butterflies counted each year. Therefore the total population size of all the other species has decreased considerably. 6. The NAO was more important than climate change in determining the flight phenology of the meadow brown butterfly (Maniola jurtina) at Monks Wood. In conclusion, the NAO affects the abundance of some species of British butterfly, and an aphid species, with a stronger effect on the timing of flight rather than abundance. There was evidence for a long-term decrease in the biodiversity of butterflies at Monks Wood and this decrease is likely to continue. Brunel University...|$|R

Wounded phloem of conventional plants emitted high amounts of monoterpenes while the phloem of mini plants emitted (3 Z) -hexenal and (3 Z) -hexen- 1 -ol.

The highest cabbage marketable yields and net income on sales were obtained under the 0. 9 mm pore diameter agronet maintained permanently covered which gave the highest cost benefit ratio of 1 : 17. 1 in season one and 1 : 26. 2 in season two. These results present permanent use of 0. 9 mm pore diameter agronets as a viable technology in reducing insect pest infestation and cost of cabbage production. This is achieved through reduced pesticide use with a potential of contributing towards environmentally safe and profitable cabbage production by small-scale growers in sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R
40|$|Black pepper (Piper nigrum L) is an {{important}} commodity of Indonesia, which has been cultivated since the 6 th century. The plant plays {{an important}} role in local economies since 95 % of the plantations are cultivated by smallholder farmers. Because of this important economic value, proper plant production is highly valued. One of the central factors to maintain plant production is how to control key pests of the plant such as the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, the stem borer, Lophobaris piperis, the tinged bug, Dasynus piperis, and the bug, Diconocoris hewetti (Chapter 1). Currently, farmers habitually use synthetic pesticides to control these pests. However, this habit poses not only a serious health risk to local workers and the people living near the treated areas, but also threatens non-target species (Chapter 2). Therefore, it has become an important issue to find relatively easy alternative control strategies, which are comparable effective as the synthetic pesticides, but safer to the farmers, consumers, and the environment and available at low price. One of the possible alternatives would be the use of botanical pesticides. Indonesia seems to be in a good position to develop and utilize this pesticide since the country has a rich biodiversity of plant species. Nowadays, the increased consumer request in developed countries for organic products stimulates the interest in the use of botanical pesticides. Chapter 3 describes the nematicidal activity of 17 plant extracts against the root-knot nematode, M. incognita. Results demonstrate that shapes of the dead nematodes in laboratory experiments can clearly be distinguished differed in a characteristic way, and groups of pesticides and plant extracts. This phenomenon may be an indicator for the modes of action of the tested pesticides. The green house experiment indicates that raw material of clove bud is comparable effective as the recommended synthetic pesticide. Chapter 4 describes contact toxicity, oral toxicity and repellency of 17 plant extracts against the model insect species Tribolium castaneum. This study shows that the most promising candidates for consideration as botanical pesticides are extracts of pyrethrum, sweet flag, tobacco, clove, lemongrass, neem, vetiver, graviola, citrosa and black pepper. Formulation of three of 10 most potent extracts was developed and tested in the laboratory followed by field experiments. Laboratory experiments indicate that extracts from pyrethrum, sweet flag and clove show the highest toxicity and/or repellent effect toward L. piperis. Field experiments reveal that the formulation is able to control most pest species of the pepper plants in the meantime being less toxic towards the 11 monitored species of natural enemies for known pest organisms such as caterpillars, <b>aphids,</b> <b>moths,</b> beetles than that of the recommended synthetic pesticide, deltamethrin. Furthermore, the field experiments reveal that within 9 hours after application the treated plants are recolonized again by ants and spiders, indicating a short degradation period of the formulation. Altogether it is concluded that the newly defined botanical formulation provides an effective and environmentally friendly alternative for controlling several pests of black pepper (Chapter 5). The safety of five botanical pesticides i. e. pyrethrum, clove, sweet flag, and derris is evaluated for human oral exposure via consumption of treated products. Based on literature data from human and animal studies safe levels for daily oral exposure to the various botanical preparations and/or their active ingredients were derived and these outcomes were compared to the estimated maximal daily intake of residues of the botanical pesticides expected to be present on pepper berries treated with these preparations as pesticides. Results indicate that use of extracts of sweet flag containing beta-asarone would result in a MoE that would not indicate a high priority for risk management. However, because for beta-asarone restrictions in applications as food additive are indicated and since use as a pesticide implies an avoidable risk, it is concluded that the application of this botanical pesticide should not be encouraged. The use and use levels of the other three botanical pesticides evaluated are not of safety concern (Chapter 6). Finally, in chapter 7, the implications of the presented work are discussed, with emphasis on the potency, suitability and the safety of the botanical pesticides when used against pests associated with pepper plants. Overall, the results obtained confirm the hypothesis that botanical pesticides have the potency to be used to control pests of black pepper, providing a promising alternative for synthetic pesticide use, especially because they pose lower risks for the local environment...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} insecticidal {{formulations}} were examined for their efficacy against {{a range of}} insects under laboratory conditions using a Potter Tower technique. The insecticides Yates Pyrethrum, Eco-oil, Defender, Orchex, Confidor, Agrimec, Encapsulated Pyrethrum, Encapsulated Pyrethrum and Neem, Azatin, NeemAzal, {{as well as a}} combination of the insecticides Azatin plus Eco-oil were tested at both the half as well as the full recommended field rate against a range of insect pests. In addition, the ability to synergise natural pyrethrum by {{some or all of the}} natural compounds including sesame oil, the crystalline extract of a sesame oil crude extract, dillapiole, and the synthetic synergist PBO, in spray emulsions at a variety of rates and ratios was examined in tests against the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, passionvine hopper (Scolypopa australis), greenhouse thrip, and lightbrown apple moth. Confidor and Yates Pyrethrum gave marked control (i. e. mortality > 80 %) of the greatest number of test species including the aphid, thrip and mealybug and two of the moth species for Confidor and all of the <b>moth,</b> <b>aphid</b> and thrip species for Yates Pyrethrum. It is suggested that the use of the synthetic synergist PBO could be replaced by the natural synergists including dillapiole, as well as the crystalline extract of a sesame oil crude extract at the highest ratio that was tested against the pea aphid, passionvine hopper, and lightbrown apple moth. Results with greenhouse thrip and tomato fruit worm were inconclusive. A complete summary of the results is given in abstract form for each of the three parts of this dissertation...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change has}} had {{well-documented}} {{impacts on the}} distribution and phenology of species across many taxa, but impacts on species’ abundance, which relates closely to extinction risk and ecosystem function, have not been assessed across taxa. In the most comprehensive multi-taxa comparison to date, we modelled variation in national population indices of 501 mammal, bird, <b>aphid,</b> butterfly and <b>moth</b> species {{as a function of}} annual variation in weather variables, which through time allowed us to identify a component of species’ population growth that can be associated with post- 1970 s climate trends. We found evidence that these climate trends have significantly affected population trends of 15. 8 % of species, including eight with extreme (> 30 % decline per decade) negative trends consistent with detrimental impacts of climate change. The modelled effect of climate change could explain 48 % of the significant across-species population decline in moths and 63 % of the population increase in winged aphids. The other taxa did not have significant across-species population trends or consistent climate change responses. Population declines in species of conservation concern were linked to both climatic and non-climatic factors respectively accounting for 42 and 58 % of the decline. Evident differential impacts of climate change between trophic levels may signal the potential for future ecosystem disruption. Climate change has therefore already driven large-scale population changes of some species, had significant impacts on the overall abundance of some key invertebrate groups and may already have altered biological communities and ecosystems in Great Britain...|$|R
40|$|Late blight {{caused by}} Phytophthora infestans is an {{important}} disease on potato.  Several potato hybrids have been generated by crossing local varieties (Atlantic and Granola) with Katahdin SP 951 which contains late blight resistance gene RB.  Prior to release, these hybrids need to be evaluated for their environ-mental effects on non-target organisms and natural pests and diseases. The objectives {{of the study were}} to investigate the effect of LBR potato hybrids on beneficial soil microbes, pests and diseases. The trial was conducted in the confined field trial (CFT) in Lembang, West Java. The parental non-transgenic (NT) clones (Granola, Atlantic and Katahdin) and LBR hybrids (four clones of Atlantic x Katahdin SP 951 hybrids; 10 clones of Granola x Katahdin SP 951) were planted at a plant spacing of 30 cm x 70 cm. Fungicide applications were used as treat-ments (no spray, five and twenty times sprays). The experi-ment was arranged in a randomized completely block design with three replications. The parameters determined were popula-tions of N 2 fixing and P solubilizing bacteria, soil C/N ratio as well as natural pests and diseases. The results showed that the transgenic LBR potato hybrids did not have negative effect on N fixing bacteria. The bacterial populations were around 1010 - 11 cells g- 1 soil before planting, 1012 cells at 1. 5 months after planting (MAP) and 108 cells after harvest. For P- solubilizing bacteria, their populations were 1010 cells before planting, 1012 cells at 1. 5 MAP and 1011 cells g- 1  soil after harvest. The soil C/N ratio of the transgenic plot was not statistically different compared to non-transgenic plot, i. e. 12 - 15 before planting, 10 - 11 at 1. 5 MAP, and 10 after harvest in non-spray plot. Pests and diseases such as Alternaria solani, Liriomyza, potato tubber <b>moth,</b> <b>aphid</b> and mites on the transgenic and non-transgenic plots were statistically not different. The resistance score for A. solani was 7. 2 (parental tansgenic) and 7. 6 (parental non-transgenic); for Liriomyza it was 2. 07 (parental transgenic) and 2. 32 insect per plant (parental non-transgenic), the PTM was 0. 63 (parental transgenic) and 0. 73 insect per plant (parental non-transgenic), aphid and mites were 0. 75 (parental transgenic) and 1. 68 insects per plant (parental non-transgenic). The study indicated that LBR potato hybrids did not have any negative impacts on non-target organisms...|$|R
40|$|Growers' surveys {{took place}} in all sixteen potato growing regions of South Africa in 2013 and 2014. The agro-ecological climate of these regions is diverse and potato is {{produced}} in rainy or dry seasons, in winter or summer seasons, or year round. Growers were asked how often in ten years crops suffered more than 25 % yield losses due to extreme weather events related to precipitation events such as hail, floods and droughts, and to temperature-related events such as frost and heat waves. Simultaneously they were asked their opinion about occurrence and severity of diseases caused by potato viruses, fungi and bacteria and pests such as nematodes, tuber <b>moths,</b> <b>aphids</b> and leaf miners. Weather related hazards resulted in losses over 25 % virtually {{each year in the}} Gauteng growing region due to hail, frosts and floods; losses occurred less than once every five years, for example due to extremely high temperatures, in the Sandveld area where growers take a risk by producing potatoes in hot summers. Regarding the biotic factors, every pest or pathogen assessed was reported to occur on at least one farm in each growing region. Countrywide the lowest frequency of 50 % was recorded for powdery scab whereas the insects tuber moths, leaf miners and aphids were reported most frequently, by between 88 % and 98 % of the growers. The complex of silver scurf and black dot resulted in the greatest yield losses in all growing regions, followed closely by tuber moth, early blight and the blackleg/soft rot disease complex. Yield losses due to potato virus Y, potato leaf roll virus and aphids were not reported as being very severe. When the growers' perceptions of severity of biotic factors were accumulated, significant differences between the regions appeared, with the Eastern Cape most prone with an accumulated score of 700 due to an array of pests and diseases, and the North-West with a score of only 50 mainly attributed to root knot nematodes. Growers were also asked how frequently biocides were applied to potato to control soil-borne organisms (nematicide and seed treatment), foliar fungi or insects. There were no significant correlations between frequency of biocide applications and severity of the disease as reflected in yield losses, most likely because growers use biocide applications as insurance against pests and diseases. This is common among crop farmers around the world. Although potato production in South Africa appears to carry more risks than production elsewhere, South African commercial potato growers are economically competitive when compared to growers {{in other areas of the}} globe, with comparable planting conditions and risks. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{study will}} aim to {{demonstrate}} how methods of pest control developed for conventional vegetable production can be adapted for use by organic growers. The study will concentrate on pests of umbelliferous and cruciferous crops and will be composed of 11 specific objectives outlined as follows, together with {{ways in which they}} might be achieved: 1. Adaptation of the existing carrot fly forecast to quantify how the date of crop drilling influences subsequent fly pressure. The carrot fly forecast produced at HRI Wellesbourne will be used to predict the proportion of the first generation of flies that will lay eggs on carrot crops drilled on different dates. The model will also be used to predict the timing of emergence of the subsequent fly generation within the crop. It will then be verified using data from experimental carrot plots located close to the source of the main carrot fly population at HRI; these data will be incorporated into the existing carrot fly forecast model; 2. Production of a model to quantify how crop damage can be reduced by altering the harvest date. A sub-model based on published and field data will be incorporated into the carrot fly forecast model, together with meteorological data; this model will be calibrated with experimental data collected from carrot plots at Wellesbourne; 3. Identification of times at which crops should be covered to reduce carrot fly damage. Output from the carrot fly model will be modified to identify the times at which crops should be covered and the dates after which it is safe to uncover crops for operations such as weeding; 4. Quantification of the contribution possible from host plants with various levels of resistance. Data collected at HRI Wellesbourne will be used in simple mathematical models to quantify how partial plant resistance can contribute to the reduction of carrot fly damage alone or in combination with other damage reduction techniques; 5. Verification of carrot fly control strategies. Information collected in objectives 1 - 4 will be used to produce a strategy for reducing carrot fly damage in organically grown umbelliferous crops; this will be evaluated by HDRA in commercial carrot and parsnip crops where there are high and low levels of infestation. Objectives 6 - 11 will focus on pests of cruciferous crops; 6. Adaptation of the existing pest forecasts to quantify how the judicious choice of planting and harvesting dates can be used to reduce crop damage. Existing forecasting systems for pollen beetle, cabbage root fly, cabbage <b>aphid,</b> diamond-back <b>moth,</b> small white butterfly, cabbage moth and garden pebble moth will be used to identify the periods when cruciferous crops are at risk from each of these pest species. Forecasts will be verified by experimental data obtained from cabbage plots; 7. Identification of crop/pest situations where application of crop covers would be advantageous. A literature review will be conducted to identify crop/pest combinations where it would be advantageous to apply covers to exclude insect pests; results from relevant field experiments will also be included; 8. Evaluation of simple methods for inspecting crops to determine {{the presence or absence of}} any given pest species. A literature review will be conducted, including results from studies involving sampling aphid and caterpillar pests within cruciferous crops; 9. Identification of critical periods during which control measures should be applied. The literature will be reviewed to indicate the best time to apply the various control measures available to organic growers. Output from models of pest activity will be modified to indicate the most appropriate timings for application of each control measure; 10. Verification of the pest control strategy arising from work conducted in objectives 7 - 10. This strategy will be underpinned by the pest forecast models and will be presented as a MORPH decision support system. The strategy will be evaluated in an organic cropping system by growing crops of cauliflower and cabbage in locations with different levels of pest infestation; and 11. Production of a user-friendly format for disseminating the information produced in the study to organic growers. Information will be provided in the form of a decision support system in MORPH, articles in grower publications, through the advisory network and at annual meetings for organic growers...|$|R
