40|$|To {{address the}} {{challenges}} posed by global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision recommended an "additional loss absorbency requirement" for these institutions. Along these lines, I develop a microfounded design of capital surcharges that target the interconnectedness component of systemic risk. These surcharges increase {{the costs of}} establishing interbank connections, {{which leads to a}} non-monotonic welfare effect. While reduced interconnectedness decreases welfare by restricting the ability of banks to insure against liquidity shocks, it also increases it by reducing contagion when an interconnected bank fails. Thus, the regulator faces a trade-off between efficiency and financial stability. Furthermore, I show that capital requirements are more effective than default fund contributions when tail-risk exposure is the private information of banks. I conclude by analyzing how resolution regimes and <b>stable</b> <b>funding</b> <b>requirements</b> interact with these surcharges...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of bank liquidity {{has been one}} of the most contro-versial topics in the recent debate about the reform of financial mar-kets. The new regulatory framework for banks published by the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision onDecember 16, 2010, enters new regulatory territory on several fronts. But arguably the most daring and novel rules concern bank liquidity. The “net <b>stable</b> <b>funding</b> ratio,” a <b>requirement</b> to be introduced until 2018, and the “liquidity cover-age ratio, ” for implementation in 2015, are regulatory attempts to strengthen bank balance sheets against liquidity shocks, introduced under the impression that the sudden collapses of banks in the Great Financial Crisis were avoidable and systemically dangerous. This impression is quite certainly correct, but there has been very little research in finance supporting the implementation of such instruments. The difficulties of formulating a theory of the systemic role of bank balance sheets are indeed considerable, ranging from the question of the transmission of idiosyncratic shocks in interbank markets to the questions of the costs and benefits of maturity trans-formation and the inefficiency of markets with cash-in-the-market pricing. In their paper (in this issue), Perotti and Suarez cut through all this maze and present a simple and powerful analysis of a basic externality underlying the {{regulation of}} bank liquidity. They do this in the simplest possible model of banking regu-lation: a static, partial-equilibrium, one-good model of competing firms with one aggregate externality. This approach makes it pos-sible to exhibit the market failure and the regulatory remedy very clearly. The simplicity of this approach is the strength of the paper and its greatest weakness at the same time, because the model i...|$|R

40|$|The Chinese Banking Regulatory Commission {{started the}} {{implementation}} of global capital- and liquidity standards for commercial banks in China by issuing the first regulatory elements of the Basel III accords in June 2012. This paper analyses a sample of 163 commercial banks operating in China between 2007 and 2014 and studies their Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Net <b>Stable</b> <b>Funding</b> Ratio to see whether commercial banks in China can {{comply with the requirements}} of the regulations. It also compares these capital and liquidity measures with those of large, international banks and provides an overview of the Chinese banking sector and its history. The results show that most of the commercial banks in China fulfil the minimum requirements for the Tier 1 capital ratio and the Net <b>Stable</b> <b>Funding</b> Ratio in 2014 and would have fulfilled these over the past eight years. Compared to the benchmark, commercial banks in China have lower capital ratios than most of the international banks but are within the average when comparing the Net <b>Stable</b> <b>Funding</b> Ratios. The analysis also shows that smaller- and medium-sized banks in China have high capital buffers but lower Net <b>Stable</b> <b>Funding</b> Ratios than large commercial banks. MSc in Financ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{balance sheet}} {{liquidity}} data was analyzed comprising of 157 Class I and 234 Class II banks. Class I banks are categorized {{as those with}} tier 1 capital in excess of $ 4 billion and internationally active while Class II banks are the rest. A Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive (CVAR) approach was used on balance sheet liquidity data to ascertain the behavior of variables in relation to bank failure. The study also demonstrated the nature {{of each of the}} variables containing estimated Basel III and Traditional liquidity measures for Class I and II banks. The estimated Basel III liquidity standards were made up of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net <b>Stable</b> <b>Funding</b> Ratio (NSFR) while the liquidity measures involved Government Securities Ratio (GSR) and Brokered Deposit Ratio (BDR). Results showed that a response of Net <b>Stable</b> <b>Funding</b> Ratio to a shock in Liquidity Coverage Ratio decreased in the first quarter and a steady continuous increase in the next quarters was observed. A shock on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio therefore would cause banks to increase their level of Net <b>Stable</b> <b>Funding</b> Ratio.
