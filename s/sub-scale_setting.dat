40|$|Objective To assess {{convergent}} validity, factorial validity, {{test-retest reliability}} and {{internal consistency of}} a diet quality food behaviour checklist (FBC) for low-literate, low-income Spanish speakers. Design Participants (n 90) completed three dietary recalls, the Spanish-language version of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) and the Spanish-language FBC. Factor structure was examined using principal component analysis. Spearman correlation coefficients between FBC item responses and nutrient intakes from 24 h recalls were used to estimate convergent validity. Correlation coefficients were also calculated between FBC item responses at two time points in another group of participants (n 71) to examine test-retest reliability. Cronbach's α coefficient was determined for items within each <b>sub-scale.</b> <b>Setting</b> Non-profit community agencies serving low-income clients, migrant farm worker camps and low-income housing sites in four California counties. Subjects Spanish-speaking women (n 161) who met income eligibility for the SNAP-Ed (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education). Results Factor analysis resulted in six sub-scales. Responses to nineteen food behaviour items were significantly correlated with hypothesized 24 h recall data (with a maximum correlation of 0 · 44 for drinking milk and calcium) or the USDA HFSSM (0 · 42 with the food security item). Coefficients for test-retest reliability ranged from 0 · 35 to 0 · 79. Cronbach's α ranged from 0 · 49 for the diet quality sub-scale to 0 · 80 for the fruit and vegetable sub-scale. Conclusions The twenty-two-item FBC and instruction guide {{will be used to}} evaluate USDA community nutrition education interventions with low-literate Spanish speakers. This research contributes to the body of knowledge about this at-risk population in California. © 2011 The Authors...|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} {{determined that}} the crew thought that the aircraft was higher than it actually was and that it flew into trees during its approach and crashed. Investigators found that the captain's altimeter (the left-hand altimeter) was adjusted to show a different altitude to the copilot's altimeter. The left altimeter's barometric <b>sub-scale</b> had been <b>set</b> to a pressure that {{would have resulted in}} it reading zero feet on the ground at Sheremetyevo. However the sub-scale on the copilot's altimeter was set to a pressure that would have resulted in it reading the airport's height above mean sea level when on the ground at Sheremetyevo. This was against the airline's operating procedures, but the investigation could not determine the reason for the discrepancy.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{identification}} of variables associated with health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL) in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy related to hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) would improve surgical decision-making and post-operatory follow-up in this group of patients. MethodsWe analyzed the independent association between the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory— 31 (QOLIE- 31) of 81 consecutive patients with refractory MTLE-HS. The clinical, demographic, radiological and electrophysiological variables were analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis. Key findingsApproximately 36 % (adjusted R 2 = 0. 36; R coefficient= 0. 66) of the QOLIE- 31 overall score variance was explained by the history of initial precipitant injury, family history of epilepsy, disease duration, age of epilepsy onset, seizure frequency and presence of psychiatric axis-II diagnosis. The variance of QOLIE‐ 31 sub-scales was: seizure worry= 7 %; overall QOL= 11 %; emotional well‐being= 32 %; energy/fatigue= 38 %; cognitive function= 13 %; medication effects= 7 %; social function= 13 % (R coefficient between 0. 30 and 0. 65). SignificanceThe pre-surgical variables studied had relatively low prediction capacity for the overall QOLIE- 31 score and its <b>sub-scales</b> in this <b>set</b> of Brazilian patients with refractory MTLE‐HS...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{developed}} scales for psychosocial skills {{in physical education}} and life skills (psychosocial skills in daily life) {{that can be used}} to evaluate any enhancements in psychosocial skills in physical education classes and their transfer to life skills. Nine items common to both psychosocial skills in physical education and life skills, which included decision-making and problem-solving skills (3 items), communication and interpersonal skills (4 items), and emotion and stress coping skills (2 items), were selected. For both, a 4 -point Likert scale was used. Then, both scales were administered to 245 elementary school fifth and sixth graders. The result of the exploratory factor analysis indicated that both scales are supposed to be structured by one factor, which suggests that the total score of all the nine items should be utilized as the scale score. Further, the result of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that three <b>sub-scales</b> can be <b>set</b> for scale utilization. In addition, the correlation analysis suggests that psychosocial skills in physical education and life skills may be different; this means that it is necessary to distinguish between the two. Furthermore, some issues pertaining to the further development and utilization of both scales were discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to determine which of the communication apprehension reduction methods currently available was most effective in classroom application. This contextual concern was a critical factor. Communication apprehension reduction methods not readily applicable to classroom environments were eliminated as viable treatment methods. Treatment methods (independent variables) tested in this experiment were: skills training plus cognitive restructuring, skills training only, cognitive restructuring only, and a no systematic treatment (control) group. Each of these treatments was reviewed. Nonapplicable treatment methods for classroom environments were also reviewed. Subjects were randomly chosen and {{assigned to one of}} the four experimental conditions. Three introspective self-report instruments measuring communication apprehension were employed as dependent measures. Level of communication apprehension was the dependent variable. Attempts to control a number of extraneous variables in this quasi-experimental design were made. Composite scores were made for each subject on pre-test and post-test measures, and "Difference" (D) scores were computed from these composite scores. These D scores were submitted to three sets of statistical analyses: a one-way analysis of variance, an analysis of co-variance, and an analysis of co-variance using only those subjects with pre-test composite scores falling above the marginal mean score. In addition, homogeneity of variance tests were run on experimental group variances, and correlation coefficients were computed for each of the six dependent measures (three instruments with one of these instruments having four <b>sub-scales).</b> Also, three <b>sets</b> of Dunnett's tests for comparisons of treatment groups to a control group were made. The results indicated that no significant differences occurred between any of the four experimental conditions tested. Results of the Dunnett's tests indicated that skills training plus cognitive restructuring was the most effective treatment method of those methods tested. Specifically, significant changes in level of communication apprehension occurred from pre-test to post-test trials when only those subjects above the marginal mean score were used. Based on the findings reported, instructors were recommended to use skills training plus cognitive restructuring as a communication apprehension reduction technique in classroom environments. The author also recommended that skills training plus cognitive restructuring be employed only with those students experiencing a moderate or high level of communication apprehension...|$|R
