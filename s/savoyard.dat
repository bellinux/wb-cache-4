5|$|Early 21st-century research, however, {{suggested}} that Master James' role, and <b>Savoyard</b> influence more generally, {{may have been}} overstated. The stonework of the sites in North Wales is of much higher quality than that in North Italy, and key features – such as the gatehouses – are not seen in <b>Savoyard.</b> Research indicates that Master James also appears {{to have had a}} stronger project management function, rather than an architectural design role, {{in the development of the}} sites. Furthermore, in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built only after James had left the region, and would never have been seen by the architect. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the projects, rather than that of a single individual.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} Bulgarians and Byzantines had clashed again in 1364. In 1366, when Emperor John V Palaiologos was returning from {{his trip to}} the west, the Bulgarians refused to let him pass through Bulgaria. This stance backfired, as another Byzantine ally, Count Amadeus VI of Savoy, leading the <b>Savoyard</b> crusade, captured several Bulgarian maritime cities in retaliation, including Ankhialos (Pomorie) and Mesembria (Nesebǎr), though he failed to take Varna. Outmanoeuvred, Ivan Alexander was forced to make peace.|$|E
5|$|After Eleanor's marriage, {{many of her}} <b>Savoyard</b> {{relatives}} {{joined her}} in England. At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236, coming from Savoy, Burgundy and Flanders, including Eleanor's uncles: Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and William became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages {{for many of them}} into the English nobility, a practice that initially caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing into the hands of foreigners. The Savoyards were careful not to exacerbate the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important power base for Eleanor in England.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{employed}} trusted {{architects and}} engineers {{to run the}} projects, most prominently the <b>Savoyard</b> Master James of St George, but also Edward's close friend Otto de Grandson, the soldier Sir John de Bonvillars and the master mason John Francis. The English had built castles {{in the wake of}} the 1272 conflict, usually larger and more expensive than those of the local Welsh rulers, but the new fortifications were on a still grander scale. Carpenters, ditch diggers and stonemasons were gathered by local sheriffs from across England and mustered at Chester and Bristol, before being sent on to North Wales in the spring, returning home each winter. The number of workers involved was so great that it placed a significant strain on England's national labour force. The costs were huge: Caernarfon's castle and walls cost £15,500, Conwy's castle and walls came to around £15,000 and Harlech Castle cost £8,190 to construct.|$|E
5|$|The Edwardian {{sites have}} strong {{architectural}} links to castles and town walls {{built in the}} kingdom of Savoy in North Italy during the same period. The resemblance between the two sets of buildings was first noted by historian Arnold Taylor in the 1950s. Similarities include the semi-circular door arches, window styles, corbelled towers, the positioning of putlog holes, tall circular towers and crenellations with pinnacles found in Edward's works in North Wales; in Savoy these can be seen in constructions such as the defences of Saillon, La Bâtiaz and Chillon Castles. Many of these similarities have been considered {{to be the result of}} the influence of the Savoy architect Master James of St George, employed by Edward I, and who brought other <b>Savoyard</b> architects with him to North Wales.|$|E
5|$|The discontent finally {{erupted in}} April, when {{seven of the}} major English and <b>Savoyard</b> barons – Simon de Montfort, Roger and Hugh Bigod, John Fitzgeoffrey, Peter de Montfort, Peter de Savoy and Richard de Clare – {{secretly}} formed an alliance to expel the Lusignans from court, a move probably quietly supported by the Queen. On 30 April, Roger Bigod marched into Westminster {{in the middle of}} the King's parliament, backed by his co-conspirators, and carried out a coup d'état. Henry, fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned, agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen, half chosen by the King and half by the barons. His own nominees to the council drew heavily on the hated Lusignans.|$|E

50|$|Les deux petits <b>savoyards</b> (The Two Little <b>Savoyards)</b> is a {{comic opera}} in one act by the French {{composer}} Nicolas Dalayrac. It was first {{performed by the}} Comédie-Italienne at the first Salle Favart in Paris on January 14, 1789. The libretto is by Benoît-Joseph Marsollier des Vivetières. The opera was a great success; according to {{the records of the}} Comédie-Italienne, 104,000 spectators had seen it by 1793. The theme of reconciliation between the social classes appealed to audiences {{at the beginning of the}} French Revolution. Les deux petits <b>savoyards</b> received its British premiere at Sadler's Wells in June, 1789 and it first appeared in the United States in Philadelphia in 1797.|$|R
5|$|The {{pressure}} for reform {{continued to grow}} unabated and a fresh parliament met in June, passing a set of measures known as the Provisions of Oxford, which Henry swore to uphold. These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons, which then {{had the power to}} appoint England's justiciar, chancellor, and treasurer, and which would be monitored through triannual parliaments. Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform, intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King's officials and the major barons. The elected council included representatives of the <b>Savoyard</b> faction but no Poitevins, and the new government immediately took steps to exile the leading Lusignans and to seize key castles across the country.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{court was}} formed round Henry's trusted friends, such as Richard de Clare, the {{brothers}} Hugh and Roger Bigod and Humphrey de Bohun and Henry's brother, Richard. Henry {{wanted to use}} his court to unite his English and continental subjects, and it included Simon de Montfort, originally a French knight who had married Henry's sister Eleanor and become the Earl of Leicester, {{in addition to the}} later influxes of Henry's <b>Savoyard</b> and Lusignan relatives. The court followed European styles and traditions, and was heavily influenced by Henry's Angevin family traditions: French was the spoken language, it had close links to the royal courts of France, Castile, the Holy Roman Empire and Sicily, and Henry sponsored the same writers as the other European rulers.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{government}} relied {{primarily on}} Eleanor and her <b>Savoyard</b> supporters, and it proved short-lived. He attempted {{to settle the}} crisis permanently by forcing the barons {{to agree to the}} Treaty of Kingston. This treaty introduced a system of arbitration to settle outstanding disputes between the King and the barons, using Richard as an initial adjudicator, backed up by Louis of France should Richard fail to generate a compromise. Henry softened some of his policies in response to the concerns of the barons, but he soon began to target his political enemies and recommence his unpopular Sicilian policy. Henry's government was weakened by the death of de Clare, as his heir, Gilbert, sided with the radicals; the King's position was further undermined by major Welsh incursions along the Marches and the Pope's decision to reverse his judgement on the Provisions, this time confirming them as legitimate. By early 1263, Henry's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war.|$|E

5|$|The {{walls of}} Conwy were built at {{around the same}} time as the castle itself, under the overall {{supervision}} of Master James of Saint George, Edward's chief architect in North Wales. Each summer huge numbers of labourers were mobilised from across England, massed at Chester, and then brought into Wales for the building season. The first phase of work on the walls in 1283 involved digging ditches and erecting a palisade around the future town to secure the area in order to allow further work to commence. The stone walls and towers were then constructed in three phases. Between 1284 and 1285, Richard the Engineer, Master James' second in command in North Wales, built the western side of the walls; this was the most vulnerable side of the town and was deliberately given priority. In 1286, John Francis, a <b>Savoyard</b> mason, finished the south wall and in 1287 the remainder of the walls along the eastern quayside were completed under the supervision of Philip of Darley. Edward's accountants did not separate the costs of the town walls from that of the castle, and the total cost of the two projects came to around £15,000, a huge sum for the period.|$|E
25|$|Catinat {{left his}} camp at Cavour and marched south with the {{intention}} of taking Saluzzo; when Amadeus moved to stop him, the result was the engagement at the abbey of Staffarda on 18 August. Marshes and hedges impeded movement on the battlefield and sheltered the <b>Savoyard</b> line, but French troops eventually broke Amadeus's army. Only Eugene's command of the <b>Savoyard</b> cavalry and his conduct in retreat saved the Allied army from disaster. Amadeus suffered 2,800 casualties and 1,200 prisoners; he also lost 11 of his 12 cannon. Catinat's casualties amount to some 2,000 troops.|$|E

In the spring of 1283, Rudolf, King of Germany and emperor-elect, was trying to enforce his authority in Helvetia, and encroaching on the <b>Savoyard</b> sphere of influence. After his initial assault on Payerne in the Vaud was repulsed in June, Louis came to the city with a body of troops to relieve it.

25|$|French {{demands from}} the Duke were {{nothing less than}} an attack on <b>Savoyard</b> independence, and the {{intimidation}} ultimately proved counter-productive. In the early summer of 1690 Amadeus realised he had {{to stand up to}} France and he began to look towards the Grand Alliance. But he had conditions. Amadeus reiterated his family claim to the Duchy of Montferrat, over which the House of Savoy was in perennial dispute with the Duke of Mantua, stipulating the razing of Casale as the minimum he would accept in this region; he also demanded the reacquisition of Pinerolo as {{the sine qua non of}} <b>Savoyard</b> entry into the war on the Allied side, and sought to take over at least one French place in Dauphiné. Amadeus's hectic preparations for war and his negotiations for financial assistance from England and Spain, were followed by a declaration of war against France on 4 June.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} ruler in northern Italy was Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy, {{who had a}} claim to the Spanish thrones through his great-grandmother, daughter of Philip II of Spain. Like the Emperor, the Duke had designs on the neighbouring Duchy of Milan, and he flirted with both Louis XIV and Leopold I to secure his own ambitions. However, the Duke of Anjou's accession to the Spanish thrones and the subsequent dominance of the Bourbons had initially proved to be most persuasive argument, and on 6 April 1701 Victor Amadeus reluctantly renewed his alliance with France. French troops bound for Milan were now permitted to march through <b>Savoyard</b> territory. In return, the Duke was to receive subsidies and the title of supreme commander of the <b>Savoyard</b> and Bourbon armies in Italy (in practice {{it was only a}} nominal title), though he was offered no territorial promises. The alliance was sealed with Philip V's marriage to Amadeus' 13-year-old daughter, Maria Luisa.|$|E
