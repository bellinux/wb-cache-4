5|$|Officials in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Wyoming, Arizona, Oklahoma and Missouri opposed those {{elements}} of ACA over {{which they had}} discretion. For example, Missouri declined to expand Medicaid or establish a health insurance marketplace engaging in active non-cooperation, enacting a statute forbidding any <b>state</b> <b>or</b> <b>local</b> official to render any aid not specifically required by federal law. Other Republican politicians discouraged efforts to advertise {{the benefits of the}} law. Some conservative political groups launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment.|$|E
5|$|The United States Numbered Highway System (often called U.S. Routes or U.S. Highways) is an {{integrated}} network of roads and highways numbered within a nationwide grid in the contiguous United States. As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, {{they are sometimes}} called Federal Highways, but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by <b>state</b> <b>or</b> <b>local</b> governments since their initial designation in 1926.|$|E

5|$|After the 1982 Tylenol murders, new FDA {{regulations}} {{went into}} effect which made it a federal - rather than just a <b>state</b> <b>or</b> <b>local</b> - crime to tamper with consumer products. Local and state authorities are not, however, prevented from also filing charges in such cases. Under this law, Nickell's crime was prosecutable as a federal product tampering case {{as well as a}} state murder case, and she was convicted not of murder, but of product tampering that caused death. The possibility of state charges for the actual murders of Susan Snow and Bruce Nickell continues to exist.|$|E
5|$|Several {{changes were}} made during the renovation. The {{vertical}} marquee which had marked the theatre's presence from 1926 to 1980, was removed, the orchestra pit and auditorium seating were rebuilt, the dressing rooms moved, and the technical systems updated. However, the furniture, fixtures and interior signage were retained. Even the paint was carefully restored to its original luster. The renovation made it suitable again for live performances and filled Seattle's need for a touring Broadway musical venue. Renovation work was completed without federal, <b>state,</b> <b>or</b> <b>local</b> funds.|$|E
5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any <b>state</b> <b>or</b> <b>local</b> jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978) {{that affirmative action}} {{in the form of}} racial quotas in public {{university}} admissions was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; however, race could be used as one of several factors without violating of the Equal Protection Clause or Title VI. In Gratz v. Bollinger (2003) and Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), the Court considered two race-conscious admissions systems at the University of Michigan. The university claimed that its goal in its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity. In Gratz, the Court struck down a points-based undergraduate admissions system that added points for minority status, finding that its rigidity violated the Equal Protection Clause; in Grutter, the Court upheld a race-conscious admissions process for the university's law school that used race as one of many factors to determine admission. In Fisher v. University of Texas (2013), the Court ruled that before race {{can be used in a}} public university's admission policy, there must be no workable race-neutral alternative. In Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2014), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on the <b>state</b> <b>or</b> <b>local</b> use of affirmative action.|$|E

25|$|Because of this, {{zero coupon}} bonds subject to U.S. {{taxation}} should generally {{be held in}} tax-deferred retirement accounts, to avoid paying taxes on future income. Alternatively, when purchasing a zero coupon bond issued by a U.S. <b>state</b> <b>or</b> <b>local</b> government entity, the imputed interest is free of U.S. federal taxes, and in most cases, state and local taxes, too.|$|E
