50|$|In the oil industry, {{following}} {{the definition of}} the American Petroleum Institute, a standard barrel of oil is often taken to mean the amount of oil that at a standard pressure (14.696 psi) and temperature (60 F) would occupy a volume of exactly 1 bbl. This standard barrel of oil will occupy a different volume at different pressures and temperatures. A standard barrel in this context is thus not simply a measure of volume, but of volume under specific conditions. The task of converting this standard barrel of oil to a <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metre</b> of oil is {{complicated by the fact that}} the <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metre</b> is defined by the American Petroleum Institute to mean the amount of oil that at 101.325 kPa and 15 C occupies 1 cubic metre. The fact that the conditions are not exactly the same means that an exact conversion is impossible unless the exact expansion coefficient of the crude is known, and this will vary from one crude oil to another.|$|E
40|$|Under certain {{operating}} conditions, polychlorinated {{dioxins and furans}} {{occur in}} the flue gases of thermal processing plants. Current EU Directives limit the concentration of these emissions to less than 0. 1 ng toxicity equivalents (TEQ) per <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metre</b> of dry gas at 11 vol% O- 2. These Directives {{have been included in}} the emission regulations of most of the EU countries. Dioxins and furans are not particular to incinerators; they can also originate from metallurgical and other thermal processes when these are operated under unfavourable conditions. Adsorption methods employing non-flammable carbonaceous adsorbents (activated carbon, lignite) are particularly well suited for removing PCDD/Fs. For adsorption, which requires the sorbent to be brought in contact with the gas to be cleaned, various processes are currently available, ie classical adsorption in moving/fixed bed filters or the technique of adsorption in an entrained dust cloud with a downstream fabric filter or electrostatic precipitator to remove the spent sorbent from the waste gas (entrained process). The paper will firstly assess both adsorption concepts; it will then use results obtained from operational tests in incineration plants for municipal and industrial waste to describe the efficiency of the dioxin-sorption in an entrained bed (pneumatic transport of pulverized adsorbent) and a fixed/moving bed (granular adsorbent). Variations in the dosing rate and the use of different adsorbents, as well as the operating temperature, identify the selection criteria for determining the process-engineering optimum for flue gas cleaning. The paper will demonstrate that the PCDDIF emissions can be reduced to below 0. 1 ng TEQ Nm(- 3) and will identify the operating conditions required to achieve this standard.

40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} is a major contributor to Norway’s economy and the country as a whole. In the last 50 years, 6. 6 billion <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> of oil equivalents have been extracted from the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). There are an estimated 7. 7 billion <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> of oil equivalents left in the ground. This includes both oil and gas. To be able to extract the remaining resources, there is a significant need for further investments. This thesis will try to answer the following question: What is the estimated future requirement for investment in the NCS in order to extract the remaining oil and gas resources? The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) has a database that contains information of all the resources. The resources are divided into four: undiscovered resources, discovered resources, resources in production and sold resources. This information has been used to find the remaining resources for each class in barrels per oil equivalent. Rystad Energy has a database containing costs per field at fields in the NCS. Using this database they have estimated the future unit costs to be 8 for exploration, 14 for development and 9 for production. All costs are in USD per barrel of oil equivalents. The conclusion of this paper estimate future requirement for investment in the NCS to extract the remaining oil and gas resources to be USD 1058. 6 billion. The need for investment to explore, develop and produce the undiscovered resources is USD 569. 4 billion. Discovered resources have a need for investment of USD 368. 8 billion to be developed and produced. Resources in production have a need for investment of USD 120. 4 billion to be produced. NCS is divided in three regions, The North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea. The estimated need for investment for each region is USD 475. 3 billion for the North Sea, USD 261. 2 billion for the Norwegian Sea and USD 321. 8 billion for the Barents Sea. In the work of this thesis there have been used different unit cost scenarios to show how this affects the overall need for investment in the NCS and for each region. Results regarding an overall unit cost increase, investment needed at different sizes of undiscovered resources and resource life are also presented in this paper. The results are uncertain for many reasons. The undiscovered resources are only estimated values based on geological methods and the exact size of the remaining resources can only be taken for granted when the resources eventually are produced and sold. The unit cost per barrel of oil equivalents is an estimation of future costs which is by nature uncertain...|$|R

40|$|The energy {{potential}} of geothermal {{waters in the}} geopressured reservoirs of the Gulf Coast ultimately depends on the yield of wells tapping these reservoirs. An analysis is made to determine possible well yields in a geopressured reservoir in Hidalgo County, Texas. The reservoir lies beneath an area 16 kilometres (10 miles) wide and 48 kilometres (30 miles) long, with the long axis extending northeast-southwest parallel to and east of the McAllen fault. The average pressure-to-depth ratio in the reservoir is 17 kilonewtons per square metre per metre (0. 75 {{pound per square inch}} per foot). The average temperature of the water is 135 °C (275 "F), and the average salinity is about 25, 000 milligrams per litre. On the basis of solubility data, the average methane content is estimated to be 4. 8 <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> per <b>cubic</b> <b>metre</b> (<b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> feet per cubic foot). Based on an idealized model of the reservoir, the results of the analysis indicate that a single 0. 23 -metre (0. 75 -foot) diameter well {{at the center of the}} reservoir could sustain a flow rate of 0. 31 <b>cubic</b> <b>metre</b> per second (11 cubic feet per second) for 20 years. The total production rate from the reservoir could be increased to 2. 7 <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> per second (95 cubic feet per second) for the 20 -year period by assuming that a minimum flow rate of 0. 15 <b>cubic</b> <b>metre</b> per second (5. 3 cubic feet per second) per well is satisfactory and by developing the reservoir with 18 wells at optimum spacing. Estimates of subsidence under the 18 -well production scheme indicate that the average subsidence over the reservoir area would be about 1 metre (3 feet) at the end of the 20 -year production period. In the immediate vicinity of a centrally located well, subsidence would be about 2 metres (6 feet). The thermal, mechanical, and methane energy contained in the waters produced with the 18 -well development scheme is equivalent to 11. 32 X 10 {sup 17 } joules (10. 73 X 10 {sup 14 } British thermal units). The thermal and mechanical energy components of this total could be converted to 94 megawatts (estimated) of electrical power over the 20 -year production period. In addition to this analysis of a geopressured reservoir, the sensitivity of well yields to hydrogeologic factors is examined. It is concluded that the most important hydrogeologic factor in the development of geopressured reservoirs is the transmissivity. The results of calculations made for this sensitivity determination are presented graphically and can be used to make quick estimates of the yield of wells tapping geopressured reservoirs.

The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations in these conditions were [*]∼[*]  150 – 280  cm − 3 at 0. 1  % and 400 – 500  cm − 3 at 0. 9  % supersaturation (SST), which are in good agreement with previous Atlantic measurements, and the cloud drop concentrations at cloud base ranged from 100 to 500  cm − 3. The concentration of CCN at 0. 1  % SST was well correlated with non-sea-salt sulfate, meaning marine sulfate formation was likely the main source of CCN. Marine organic aerosol (OA) had a similar mass spectrum to previous measurements of sea spray OA and was poorly correlated with CCN. In one case study that was significantly different to the rest, polluted anthropogenic emissions from the southern and central UK advected to the peninsula, with significant enhancements of OA, ammonium nitrate and sulfate, and black carbon. The CCN concentrations here were around 6 times higher than in the clean cases, and the cloud drop number concentrations were 3 – 4  times higher. Sources of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) were assessed by comparing different parameterisations used to predict INP concentrations, using measured aerosol concentrations as input. The parameterisations based on total aerosol produced INP concentrations that agreed within an order of magnitude with measured first ice concentrations at cloud temperatures as low as − 12  °C. Composition-specific parameterisations for mineral dust, fluorescent particles, and sea spray OA were 3 – 4  orders of magnitude lower than the measured first ice concentrations, meaning a source of INPs was present that was not characterised by our measurements and/or {{one or more of the}} composition-specific parameterisations greatly underestimated INPs in this environment...|$|R
