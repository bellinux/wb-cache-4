500|$|Barbara Cloud of the Pittsburgh Press gave {{attribution}} to Hershey {{for starting}} a trend {{when she had}} collagen injected into her lips {{for her role in}} Beaches (1988). Humorist Erma Bombeck said of the movie, which also starred Bette Midler, [...] "I have no idea what Beaches was all about. All I could focus on was Barbara Hershey's lips. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> stopped off at a gas station and someone said, 'Your lips are down 30 pounds. Better let me hit 'em with some air.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|About {{four hours}} later at 1:30am, she was found naked, gagged, tied up, and covered in mud and blood. [...] Meili was {{discovered}} in a shallow ravine in a wooded area of the park about [...] north of the 102nd Street Transverse. The first policeman who saw her said: [...] "She was beaten as badly as anybody I've ever seen beaten. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> was tortured." ...|$|E

50|$|Gaby models the old dress, {{which now}} fits perfectly. When her seamstress, Jean, tells her <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> hasn't changed at all, Gaby thanks her {{for all her}} help over the years.|$|R
50|$|Chartette Langley (Teto Kasane): A lady's maid {{who serves}} the princess. She is a {{childhood}} friend of Allen and is a chimera. Though <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she's</b> fifteen, her real age is closer to thirty. She's known to have superhuman strength, and is very clumsy.|$|R
60|$|IT warn't very cheerful at breakfast. Aunt Sally {{she looked}} old and tired {{and let the}} {{children}} snarl and fuss at one another and didn't seem to notice it was going on, which wasn't her usual style; me and Tom had a plenty to think about without talking; Benny <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> hadn't had much sleep, and whenever she'd lift her head a little and steal a look towards her father you could see there was tears in her eyes; {{and as for the}} old man, his things stayed on his plate and got cold without him knowing they was there, I reckon, for he was thinking and thinking all the time, and never said a word and never et a bite.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, on my {{way down}} to Lake Winnipeg, I fell in with a brigade o' boats goin' to the Saskatchewan district, and we camped {{together}} that night. One o' the guides of the Saskatchewan brigade had his daughter with him. The guide was a French-Canadian, {{and his wife had}} been a Scotch half-caste, so what the daughter was is more than I can tell; but I know what <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> <b>She</b> just looked like an angel. It wasn't so much that she was pretty, but she was so sweet, and so quiet lookin', and so innocent! Well, to cut the matter short, I fell in love at once. D'ye know what it is, Heywood, to fall in love at first sight?" ...|$|E

5000|$|At the end, Deb is {{seen on a}} {{computer}} conversing in a chatroom. She is asked what <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> <b>She</b> types [...] "the truth or a lie?" [...] to which she is asked to lie. Now, wearing glasses again, she just turns off the computer.|$|R
50|$|Alane Shriver: Alane is {{suffering}} from a diseased called progeria, which ages her very quickly. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> is in her seventies when she {{is only in the}} sixth grade. She is very brave, outgoing, and mature for her age. <b>She</b> is also <b>looking</b> for a friend that she can’t find.|$|R
5000|$|In France, {{calling a}} young woman [...] "Mademoiselle" [...] is usually {{considered}} more polite, and calling a middle-aged woman [...] "Mademoiselle" [...] can {{be a way to}} tell her that <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> is in her twenties and may therefore be considered flattering. In Quebec, on the other hand, this usage may be considered offensive.|$|R
5000|$|About {{four hours}} later at 1:30 am, she was found naked, gagged, tied up, and covered in mud and blood. Meili was {{discovered}} in a shallow ravine in a wooded area of the park about 300 ft north of the 102nd Street Transverse.

5000|$|Jessica Riehl, {{the retired}} RCMP constable {{who was the}} last person known to have seen Yoshikubo, {{recalled}} how she had considered asking her if she needed any help. As I drove past her, I thought it might not be the best idea for her being alone." [...] She had considered turning around and going back to offer help, but decided against it. [...] "I thought, it was only 11:30 a.m., she'll be OK ... <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> was sightseeing and it was close to zero, it wasn't freezing cold, and her pink coat was knee-length and she had on mitts and a hat—she was dressed for that temperature.|$|E
5000|$|The {{keeper of}} the Sidhe's records, the Ban of Hours is very {{powerful}} but is also fond of humans and of Earth. No one who sees her can remember what <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> <b>She</b> is Tonn's daughter, sister of Elme, and she [...] "stayed by Tonn when Elme defied him", although now she covertly opposes Tarax and the Maln.|$|R
5000|$|Detective Lieutenant Maxwell Hoover and his {{partners}} Coolidge, Hall, and Relyea are called to investigate a suspicious death {{of a young woman}} found at a construction site. The evidence shows that every bone in her body is broken. A coroner deduces that <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> [...] "jumped off a cliff," [...] although there are no cliffs nearby. The woman turns out to be someone Hoover knew very well, Allison Pond.|$|R
5000|$|Elisa Allen - A thirty-five-year-old {{women who}} lives on a ranch just across the Salinas River with her husband, Henry. Elisa is {{described}} as having a [...] "lean and strong" [...] face and eyes as [...] "clear as water" [...] and when wearing her gardening costume, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> has a blocked and heavy figure. Elisa usually spends her time in the garden, tending to her chrysanthemums.|$|R
5000|$|Rosamond is {{featured}} in the third episode, Nate the Great and the Lost List (1978). She has long black hair and a short black dress, white mary jane shoes, five black cats of different sizes, and she is frequently described as [...] "strange". In particular, she is introduced thus in the first book: [...] "Rosamond did not look hungry or sleepy. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> always looks. Strange." [...] That text and Simont's illustration allegedly inspired the creation of Emily the Strange. The 2002 volume (number 22) Nate the Great, San Francisco Detective establishes that Nate the Great and the girl detective Olivia Sharp are cousins. She is the heroine of a 1989-1991 series of four books sometimes called Olivia Sharp, Agent for Secrets, written by Marjorie and Mitchell Sharmat and illustrated by Denise Brunkus.|$|E
50|$|When the {{combined}} American and Philippine Commonwealth troops re-entered the Philippines, Utinsky was taken through the Japanese lines {{by the local}} people to the American lines. She had lost 45 pounds, 35 percent of her pre-war weight, and an inch in height. Her auburn hair had turned white and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> had aged 25 years. Yet, within a few days, she wrote from memory a 30-page report listing the names of soldiers she knew had been tortured, {{the names of their}} torturers, and the names of collaborators and spies. She was attached to the U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps, and later was flown to meet the 511 POWs who were rescued from the Cabanatuan POW camp. Most of the original 9,000 American POWs in the Philippines had died or been transported to work camps in Japan or China.|$|E
5000|$|TVGuide.com {{described}} {{the show as}} [...] "Southern Exposure" [...] and, in a later review, stated that the actors are better than the [...] "cutesy" [...] material, although Bilson is not convincing as a heart surgeon. Both TVGuide.com and Robert Bianco of USA Today stated that the show is potentially offensive to the South. Bianco also wrote that the show is shallow and far-fetched, with Bilson giving an unconvincing performance, such as acting surprised when calling herself a doctor. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter stated that the series is predictable and superficial, but [...] "surprisingly touching". Goodman and Brian Lowry of Variety stated that Bilson does {{not look like a}} doctor, with Goodman writing that she looked too much [...] "like a high-priced call girl" [...] and Lowry writing that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> belonged in [...] "Barbie's medical dream house." ...|$|E

40|$|In his 1931 novella Dancers and Drawers (Dansii to zurosu), Tada Michio {{describes}} an enchanting figure, a dancehall {{girl on the}} streets of Tokyo: 2 ̆ 2 With a cheeky bob and slim legs. With stockings of a color that matches her skin so well <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> 2 ̆ 7 s not wearing any. Her shoes are patent leather with high heels.

5000|$|Ward didn't win the competition, but her fragile, unique look, got the {{attention}} of a spotter from Vivien's Model Agency who saw her potential and made a show reel. The show reel then landed on the desk of ace model scout David Cunningham from the New York City agency IMG. [...] "Look how confident she is. I mean, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she's</b> been doing this for years, and she's a 15-year-old kid walking in an alleyway in Perth ... She's a supermodel, for sure," [...] Cunningham said.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the judging}} panel, Jodilly, Josephine and Nicole were {{acclaimed}} by the judges, securing {{the top three}} spots, giving Josephine her fourth non-consecutive top three appearance, a feat held by Sheena as well. Marie and Sneha showed improvement and received mixed reactions from the panel. Jodilly and Josephine both gave romantic shots, with Josephine slightly off the concept as {{she seemed to have}} paid more attention to the male models on her photo than to the car, which should have been the major point of the shoot. Tia and Janice were critiqued for appearing lost and consistently delivering nothing through their shots. Tia delivered too much [...] "ego", while Janice's 'pull-my-hair' poses were awkward, despite her swagger. Last week's best photo winner Natalie, who was slowly improving, seemed to have taken a step back as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> was staggering in pain on her photo. Generally, all the girls showed some improvement.|$|E
50|$|Back at the house, Courtenay {{shared her}} sorrow and {{frustration}} to Michaela about her miserable {{performance at the}} Go-Sees. The girls receive Sara Mail the next day for the photoshoot. The girls arrive at a new Glassons clothing store in downtown Auckland where they are greeted by Chris and their photographer, Craig Owen. The girls are told {{that they are going}} to pose for new advertisements for the clothing store while portraying over dramatic feminine alter ego's. Elza is up first, who instantly impresses the photographer. She is quoted as having 'a lovely angelic face'. Elza's wig for the shoot was inspired by Lady Gaga's hair bow. Courtenay comes on set and is expected to do well, but the photographer cannot connect with her and Chris thinks that she is trying too hard because of her poor performance in the Go-Sees challenge. Michaela has an unexpected breakdown while in hair and make-up, but she still impresses the photographer and manages to get one of the best shots, even though Chris had complained that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> was going to burst into tears of misery. Once back from the shoot, the girls received Sara Mail informing them of the elimination the next day. Michaela tells the girls that she feels so close but yet so far and doesn't want to be eliminated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Snow!" [...] {{repeated}} good Mr. Lindsey, {{drawing the}} reluctant guest over his hospitable threshold. [...] "No wonder <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> snow. <b>She</b> is half frozen, poor little thing! But a good fire will put everything to rights!" ...|$|R
5000|$|A Nue {{appears as}} the boss for the Extra Stage of the twelfth Touhou Project game, Undefined Fantastic Object, and is named Nue Houjuu. This Nue {{has the ability}} to conceal her true form, so all {{descriptions}} of her are different. The form <b>she's</b> fought in <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a human that has three red metallic wings and three blue wings similar to tails. This is her true form, {{and the fact that it}} is her true form is the reason she attacked the main characters, so they couldn't go out and tell everyone what <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> <b>She's</b> also enveloped in a black cloud during a few of her attacks.|$|R
50|$|As both {{author and}} artist, Martin had {{control over the}} total {{expression}} of his fiction. Like most Oz authors, he supplied a human protagonist for young readers to identify with; unusually, he made his protagonist a teenager, a fifteen-year-old boy. In his illustrations, Martin made Dorothy Gale appear somewhat older than she is generally portrayed; <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> is at least twelve years old. A {{decade and a half}} later, Dave Hardenbrook would also offer a teenage protagonist in his 2000 novel The Unknown Witches of Oz; Martin does not go as far as Hardenbrook later would in making his teen hero a romantic interest.|$|R
5000|$|Her Tamil debut was Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam {{opposite}} Siva Karthikeyan, {{which was}} directed by Ponram. Sri Divya received very positive reviews from critics for her performance. Baradwaj Rangan wrote, [...] "the actress is good. She knows the language, knows how to work a reaction shot, and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> belongs in this milieu. It {{will be interesting to}} see what Tamil cinema makes of her". The Times of India wrote, [...] "But the real surprise is debutant Sri Divya, who, is expressive, and can lip-sync very well, which isn't the case with most of our heroines today". The New Indian Express wrote, [...] "As Latha, debutant Sridivya emotes well, infusing the character with innocence, charm and naughtiness".|$|R
500|$|Anna Pickard of The Guardian took a {{different}} opinion choosing to focus on how Cole appeared to be [...] "making up {{for the lack of}} having Girls Aloud around her by pretending to be all of them at once" [...] and anguish of her own marriage issues. She noted that Cole's various outfits appear to distract people from the lyrics of the song which [...] "seem to be, a thinly veiled reflection on her own marriage compounded by the sad mooning face she keeps pulling. [...] singing a solo song about one's troubled (though reconciled and apparently happy) marriage. Although sometimes <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> cross instead. And quite a lot of the time, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she's</b> her own evil sexy twin." ...|$|R

5000|$|On February 23, 2010, various news sources {{reported}} that Kornheiser had been suspended from ESPN {{for two weeks}} for comments he made on his radio show about fellow high-profile ESPN personality Hannah Storm's wardrobe that day. [...] Hannah Storm in a horrifying, horrifying outfit today. She's got on red go-go boots and a Catholic school plaid skirt. Way too short for somebody in her 40s or maybe early 50s by now. And she's got on her typically very, very tight shirt. So <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she's</b> got sausage casing wrapping around her upper body. I mean, I know she's very good, and I'm {{not supposed to be}} critical of ESPN people, so I won't ... But, Hannah Storm, come on now! Stop! What are you doing? ... She's what I would call a Holden Caulfieldfantasy at this point. Tony Kornheiser ...|$|R
