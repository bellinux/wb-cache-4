Because of the conjugation between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized, enabling the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds.|$|E

25|$|Arginine (abbreviated as Arg or R) is an α-amino acid {{that is used}} in the {{biosynthesis}} of proteins. It is encoded by the codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG. It {{contains an}} α-amino group, an α-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain consisting of a 3-carbon aliphatic <b>straight</b> <b>chain</b> ending in a guanidino group. At physiological pH, the carboxylic acid is deprotonated (−COO−), the amino group is protonated (−NH3+), and the guanidino group is also protonated to give the guanidinium form (-C-(NH2)2+), making arginine a charged, aliphatic amino acid. It is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nitric oxide.|$|E
25|$|The suffix -ol {{appears in}} the IUPAC {{chemical}} name of all substances where the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority; in substances where a higher priority group is present the prefix hydroxy- {{will appear in the}} International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name. The suffix -ol in non-systematic names (such as paracetamol or cholesterol) also typically indicates that the substance includes a hydroxyl functional group and, so, can be termed an alcohol. But many substances, particularly sugars (examples glucose and sucrose) contain hydroxyl functional groups without using the suffix. An important class of alcohols, of which methanol and ethanol are the simplest members is the saturated <b>straight</b> <b>chain</b> alcohols, the general formula for which is CnH2n+1OH.|$|E
25|$|Internal gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} gears {{involved}} are hidden within a wheel hub. Hub gears work using internal planetary, or epicyclic, gearing which alters {{the speed of the}} hub casing and wheel relative to the speed of the drive sprocket. They have just a single chainring and a single rear sprocket, almost always with a <b>straight</b> <b>chain</b> path between the two. Hub gears are available with between 2 and 14 speeds; weight and price tend to increase with the number of gears. All the advertised speeds are available as distinct gear ratios controlled by a single shifter (except for some early 5-speed models which used two shifters). Hub gearing is often used for bicycles intended for city-riding and commuting.|$|E

50|$|Whether or not {{polymers}} can crystallize {{depends on}} their molecular structure - presence of <b>straight</b> <b>chains</b> with regularly spaced side groups facilitates crystallization. For example, crystallization occurs much easier in isotactic than in the atactic polypropylene form. Atactic polymers crystallize when the side groups are very small, as in polyvinyl and don't crystallize in case of large substituents like in rubber or silicones.|$|R

Although these organisms grow in a wide pH range (from 5 to 11), they show a growth optimum at pH 9. They produce grey spore masses and grey-yellow reverse pigments when they grow as colonies. The spores have smooth surfaces and are arranged as <b>straight</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|R

[...] The use of two derailleurs generally results in some duplicate or near duplicate gear ratios, so that the number of distinct gear ratios is typically around two-thirds of the number of advertised gear ratios. The more common configurations have specific names [...] which are usually related to the relative step sizes between the front chainrings and the rear cogset.|$|E

The target product, F(CF2)7COF (not represented) is produced as only 10–15% {{of the total}} product, while the main products are perfluorinated cyclic ether isomers, including FC-75. To yield PFOA, the perfluorinated acid fluoride is hydrolyzed. The PFOA formed by this method {{is a mixture of}} <b>straight</b> <b>chain</b> (78%), terminally branched (13%), and internally branched (9%) molecules, as ECF rearranges the carbon [...] "tail" [...] of the acid chloride. ECF also results in production wastes. 3M synthesized ECF PFOA at their Cottage Grove, MN facility from 1947 to 2002 and was the world's largest producer. ECF production continues on a smaller scale in Europe and Asia.|$|E

The wettability of a surface is determined by the outermost chemical groups of the solid.Differences in wettability between surfaces that are similar in structure are due to differences in packing of the atoms.

2500|$|Reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) has a {{non-polar}} {{stationary phase}} and an aqueous, moderately polar mobile phase. One common stationary phase is a silica which has been surface-modified with RMe2SiCl, where R is a <b>straight</b> <b>chain</b> alkyl group such as C18H37 or C8H17. With such stationary phases, retention time is longer for molecules which are less polar, while polar molecules elute more readily (early in the analysis). An investigator can increase retention times by adding more water to the mobile phase; thereby making the affinity of the hydrophobic analyte for the hydrophobic stationary phase stronger relative to the now more hydrophilic mobile phase. Similarly, an investigator can decrease retention time by adding more organic solvent to the eluent. RP-HPLC is so commonly used that it is often incorrectly referred to as [...] "HPLC" [...] without further specification. The pharmaceutical industry regularly employs RP-HPLC to qualify drugs before their release.|$|E

The ground-state structures are <b>straight</b> carbon <b>chains</b> with a P 2 C ring connected at one end and a phosphorus atom at the other. The bond length features of the <b>straight</b> <b>chains</b> suggest a polyacetylene-like structure for even n and cumulenic-like structure for odd n. The CnP 3 + (n = 1 - 8) with even number of carbon atoms are more stable than those with odd number. The odd/even alternation trend can be explained according to the variation of bonding characters, ionization potentials, and incremental binding energies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
