60|$|To give {{a single}} <b>signatory</b> <b>Power</b> {{the right of}} forbidding a change desired by all the others, imposes a kind of {{perpetuity}} on treaty stipulations, that in practice neither could nor ought to be insisted upon. For instance it would have tied fast the hands of Cavour and Victor Emmanuel in the Italian transactions which Mr. Gladstone had followed and assisted with so much enthusiasm, for Austria would never have assented. It is, moreover, true that in the ever recurring eras when force, truculent and unabashed, sweeps aside the moral judgments of the world, the mere inscription of a pious opinion in a protocol may seem worth little trouble. Yet it is the influence of good opinion, tardy, halting, stumbling, and broken, as it must ever be, that upholds and quickens the growth of right. The good rules laid down in conferences and state-papers may look tame {{in the glare of}} the real world of history as it is. Still, if we may change the figure, they help to dilute the poisons in the air.|$|E
60|$|The courses {{open to the}} British Government in {{the face}} of the {{circular}} were these. They might silently or with a protest acquiesce. Or they might declare an offensive war (much deprecated by Turkey herself) against a nation that had peculiar advantages for defence, and for an object that every other <b>signatory</b> <b>power</b> thought in itself a bad object. Third, they might, in accordance with a wonderfully grand scheme suggested to ministers, demand from Germany, all flushed as she was with military pride, to tell us plainly whether she was on our side or Russia’s; and if the German answer did not please us, then we should make an offensive alliance with France, Austria, Italy, and Turkey checking Russia in the east and Germany in the west. A fourth plan was mutely to wait, on the plea that whatever Russia might have said, nothing had been done. The fifth plan was a conference. This was hardly heroic enough to please everybody in the cabinet. At least it saved us from the insanity of a war that would have intensified European confusion, merely to maintain restraints considered valuable by nobody. The expedient of a conference was effectively set in motion by Bismarck, then pre-occupied in his critical Bavarian treaty and the siege of Paris. On November 12, Mr. Odo Russell left London for Versailles on a special mission to the Prussian king. The intrepidity of our emissary soon secured a remarkable success, and the episode of Bismarck’s intervention in the business was important.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} the Anti-Comintern Pact {{go back to the}} autumn of 1935 shortly after the Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, when various German {{officials}} both within and outside the Foreign Ministry were attempting to balance the competing demands upon the Reichs foreign policy by its traditional alliance with China versus Hitlers desire for friendship with Chinas archenemy, Japan. In October 1935, the idea was mooted that an anti-Communist alliance might be able to tie in the Kuomintang regime, Japan and Germany. In particular, this idea appealed to Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Special Ambassador at Large and head of the Dienststelle Ribbentrop and the Japanese Military Attaché in Berlin, General Hiroshi Ōshima, who hoped that such an alliance might lead to Chinas subordination to Japan. Lack of Chinese interest doomed the projects original intention, but October-November 1935, Ribbentrop and Oshima worked out a treaty directed against the Comintern. The Pact was to be originally introduced in late November 1935 with invitations for Britain, Italy, China and Poland to join. However, concerns by the German Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath and War Minister Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg that the pact might damage Chinese-German relations plus political disarray in Tokyo following the failed military coup of February 26, 1936 led to the Pacts being shelved for a year. By the summer of 1936, the increased influence of the military in the Japanese government, concerns in Berlin and Tokyo about the Franco-Soviet alliance, and Hitlers desire for a dramatic anti-Communist foreign policy gesture that he believed might bring about an Anglo-German alliance led to the idea of the Anti-Comintern Pact being revived. The Pact was initialed on October 23, 1936, and signed on November 25, 1936. In order to avoid damaging relations with the Soviet Union, the Pact was supposedly directed only against the Comintern, but in fact contained a secret agreement that in the event of either <b>signatory</b> <b>power</b> becoming involved with a war with the Soviet Union, the other <b>signatory</b> <b>power</b> would maintain a benevolent neutrality.|$|E

25|$|Under the treaty, the European powers {{recognized}} and guaranteed the independence and neutrality of Belgium and established the full {{independence of the}} German-speaking part of Luxembourg.

50|$|Even so, {{there were}} {{internal}} conflicts within the league. Because Bautzen {{served as the}} administrative center and capital of the league, it had the first voice in the local council, {{as well as several}} other rights and privileges. Bautzen reserved <b>signatory</b> <b>power</b> for the league concerning legal documents, and reserved the right to open all of the league's official mail. Bautzen's other special privilege as administrative center was that it was the seat of the king's representative to the league, combining military, administrative, and royal power within the town. This caused conflicts with Görlitz, especially as Görlitz had quickly and unequivocally established itself as the economic center of the league. Görlitz achieved this position of economic superiority by being more easily reached by local traffic, and expolited the advantages it gained. As time went on, Görlitz exercised more and more power within the league, even as Bautzen remained the league's administrative center.|$|E

50|$|On 12 August 1898, in a {{circular}} letter addressed to the representatives of different nations, the Emperor of Russia proposed to all governments, which had duly accredited representatives at the imperial court, the holding of a conference to consider {{the problem of the}} preservation of peace among nations. During the summer of 1900 the conference assembled at The Hague and on 4 September the formal notification of the ratification of the convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes was given by the United States, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Persia, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Siam, Spain, Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands, and subsequently by Japan. A Permanent Court of Arbitration was established at The Hague, composed representatives of each of the <b>signatory</b> <b>powers</b> appointed for a term of six years. Arbitrators called upon to form a competent tribunal may be chosen from a general list {{of the members of the}} court when any of the <b>signatory</b> <b>powers</b> desire to have recourse to the court for a settlement of any difference between them.|$|R

50|$|The Washington Treaty limits were {{extended}} and modified by the London Naval Treaty of 1930 and the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936. During the 1930s, however, {{the effectiveness of}} these agreements broke down, as some <b>signatory</b> <b>powers</b> (in particular Japan) withdrew from the treaty arrangements and others only paid lip service to them. By 1938, Britain and the USA had both invoked an 'escalator clause' in the Second London Treaty which allowed battleships of up to 45,000 tons displacement, and the Treaty was effectively defunct.|$|R
50|$|The Treaty also {{introduced}} a 'building holiday'. In general, a new ship {{could only be}} begun {{if one of the}} ships allowed by the Treaty had been in service for 20 years.

An exception was made for Britain; the Royal Navy had no existing ships with 16-inch guns, while both the U.S. Navy and Japan had 16-inch ships already in commission which would be allowed to continue {{under the terms of the}} Treaty.|$|R

25|$|The courts exacted the Oath More Judaico in {{its most}} {{offensive}} form - it was only abolished in 1904, following criticism in the French press.

50|$|Two {{days after}} signing the treaty, all four parties signed an {{addendum}} specifically acknowledging {{that the failure}} to use the languages {{of all of the}} <b>signatory</b> <b>powers</b> (the treaty was only published in English and French) was not prejudicial and should not be viewed as setting a precedent.

25|$|The Casement Report {{comprises}} {{a multitude}} of individual statements gathered by the British Consul, Roger Casement, including several detailing the grim tales of killings, mutilation, kidnapping, and cruel beatings of the native population by soldiers of the Congo administration of King Leopold. The British Parliament demanded a second meeting of the 14 <b>signatory</b> <b>powers</b> of the 1885 Berlin Conference, at which time the Belgian Parliament forced a reluctant Leopold {{to set up an}} independent commission of enquiry. This led to the arrest and punishment of several officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903. The reforms that followed the Casement Report, including those that concerned ABIR at Basankusu, set the foundation for the colonial Belgian state of Congo.|$|R
25|$|When {{the report}} was made public, opponents of Congolese {{conditions}} formed interest groups, such as the Congo Reform Association, founded by E. D.

The declaration asserted the complete legal extinction of the Third Reich following death of Adolf Hitler on 30 April 1945, but the continued subsequent existence of a German national territory; although subject to the four <b>signatory</b> <b>powers</b> also asserting their authority to determine the future boundaries of Germany.|$|R

50|$|The Casement Report {{comprises}} forty {{pages of}} the Parliamentary Papers, to which is appended another twenty pages of individual statements gathered by Casement as Consul, including several detailing grim tales of killings, mutilations, kidnappings and cruel beatings of the native population by soldiers of the Congo Administration of King Leopold. Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government {{as well as to}} nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1885, under which much of Africa had been partitioned. The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the fourteen <b>signatory</b> <b>powers</b> to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by socialist leader Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the King's Congolese policy, forced a reluctant Leopold to set up an independent commission of enquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report in every detail. This led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national who was given a five-year sentence for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives).|$|R

The conference authorized the Governments of the United States and Mexico to negotiate with the other <b>signatory</b> <b>powers</b> for the adherence of other American nations. At this conference the project of a treaty for the arbitration of pecuniary claims was adopted, and the signatories agreed for a term of five years to submit to arbitration (preferably to the permanent court at The Hague) all claims for pecuniary loss or damage presented by their respective citizens and not capable of settlement through diplomatic channels, where they were of sufficient importance to warrant the expense of a court of arbitration.|$|R
2500|$|At the Congress of Vienna, Castlereagh {{designed}} and proposed {{a form of}} collective and collaborative security for Europe, then called a Congress system.

This system was used {{in an attempt to}} address the Polish-Saxon crisis at Vienna and the question of Greek independence at Laibach. The following ten years saw five European Congresses where disputes were resolved with a diminishing degree of effectiveness. Finally, by 1822, the whole system had collapsed because of the irreconcilable differences of opinion among Britain, Austria, and Russia, and {{because of the lack of}} support for the Congress system in British public opinion. [...] The Holy Alliance, which Castlereagh opposed, lingered a little longer. [...] The order created by the Congress of Vienna was a mood that lasted much longer and worked to prevent major European wars until the First World War in 1914.

Annual elections are held in November with people coming forward to stand for the various positions. Each individual college's JCRC is slightly different in composition, however all are elected by the undergraduate population following a hustings. The successful candidates are then elected for a whole year, bar any extenuating circumstances e.g. a Vote of No Confidence. The JCRC's primary functions are to be representative of the specific needs of their undergraduate populations, and to provide welfare help to students in the form of welfare reps who can offer advice or give contact details of other groups to students through informal drop-in sessions. With York's collegiate system though, JCRCs are increasingly involved in fostering college spirit through organising the many major social events a college has, such as Christmas and Summer formal Balls.|$|R
