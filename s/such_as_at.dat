The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) announced the closure of seven liquor stores in the downtown core during the summit as a precaution to looting. The PATH, CN Tower, University of Toronto, Art Gallery of Ontario, and the Ontario Legislative Building were also closed to public during the summit dates.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to working dress, {{the army has}} a number of parade uniforms for ceremonial and non-ceremonial occasions. The most-commonly-seen uniforms are No.1 Dress (full ceremonial, seen at formal occasions <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>at</b> the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace) and No.2 Dress (Service Dress), a brown uniform worn for non-ceremonial parades.|$|E
5|$|Many hillsides, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>at</b> Cadbury Castle, Ham Hill and Maes Knoll, and {{sheltered}} valleys provided defensible {{locations for}} early human settlements. Trade was established early. The large tidal variation provided access inland, {{a key factor}} in distributing goods and produce, using rivers such as the Parrett and Avon. The tidal range of , is second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.|$|E

5|$|North of Bloor Street, {{the wide}} valley floor became {{dominated}} by industrial {{concerns of the}} Taylor family, including the Don Valley Brick Works. The area from the Forks of the Don and north along the river valleys had been lumbered and farmed, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>at</b> Milne Hollow, but several natural areas remained by the 1950s. The forests of the Don valley had been where Canadian naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton {{spent much of his}} youth in the 1870s studying animal life.|$|E
5|$|Singaporeans are {{especially}} encouraged {{to sing the}} national anthem on occasions of national celebration or national significance, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>at</b> the National Day Parade, at National Day observance ceremonies conducted by educational institutions and government departments and at sporting events at which Singapore teams are participating. In November 2004, Olivia Ong, an 18-year-old Singaporean based in Tokyo, sang Majulah Singapura at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Asian qualifying rounds at Saitama Stadium in Saitama, Japan.|$|E
5|$|Some {{international}} airports require {{construction of}} additional infrastructure {{outside of the}} airport, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>at</b> the Hong Kong International Airport, which included {{the construction of a}} high-speed railway and automobile expressway to connect the airport to the urban areas of Hong Kong. Construction of the expressway included the construction of two bridges (the Tsing Ma suspension bridge and Kap Shui Mun cable bridge) and the Ma Wan viaduct on Ma Wan island to connect the bridges. Each bridge carries rail and automobile traffic.|$|E

5|$|The Cruachan station {{temporarily}} stores {{energy at}} times of low demand, and releases it {{at times of}} high demand, when electricity prices are higher, reducing the maximum power that must be provided by power stations. It {{is also used to}} cope with sudden surges in the demand for electricity, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>at</b> the end of television programmes. Despite the use of some rainwater, Cruachan is not a net generator of electricity: it uses more energy for pumping water and spinning its turbines than it generates.|$|E
5|$|The anthem must be {{performed}} {{in accordance with the}} lyrics and sheet music established by law. Every day, state-owned Belarusian television and radio stations are required to play the national anthem upon signing on at 6 a.m. and again upon signing off (usually around midnight). The anthem can also {{be performed}} on certain occasions, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>at</b> government meetings, before sporting events and presidential inaugurations. While the anthem is being performed, citizens are required to stand at attention and those in military or police uniform must salute.|$|E

5|$|The {{links between}} castles and the {{surrounding}} lands and estates was particularly important during this period. Many castles, both royal and baronial, had deer parks or chases attached to them {{for the purposes of}} hunting. These usually stretched away from the village or borough associated with the castle, but occasionally a castle was placed in the centre of a park, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>at</b> Sandal.|$|E
5|$|When Æthelred made a {{grant to}} Berkeley Abbey in 883, {{he did it with}} the {{approval}} of King Alfred, thus acknowledging Alfred's lordship. Thereafter he usually acted with Alfred's permission, but issued some charters in his own name without reference to Alfred, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>at</b> a meeting in Risborough in Buckinghamshire in 884, showing that English Mercia extended quite far south-east towards London.|$|E
5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward was {{a single}} large room {{furnished}} {{with some kind of}} bedding and perhaps a bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. The bedding on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>at</b> Guisborough, where men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum, two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were required to be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission.|$|E

5|$|A {{wind energy}} {{penetration}} figure {{can be specified}} for different duration of time, but is often quoted annually. To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which may already have substantial storage. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored or exported. Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>at</b> night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or of natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy. Homes can also be programmed to accept extra electric power on demand, for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{the construction of}} a castle led to the destruction of a village, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>at</b> Eaton Socon in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown {{as a result of the}} presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle. The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe. When the 13th-century Safad Castle was founded in Galilee in the Holy Land, the 260villages benefitted from the inhabitants' newfound ability to move freely. When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local landscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord. Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importance– perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration– the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement depopulated.|$|E
5|$|An {{automatic}} {{traffic monitoring}} and guidance {{system is in}} place along the motorway. It consists of measuring, control and signalling devices located in zones where driving conditions may vary, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>at</b> interchanges, viaducts, bridges, tunnels and zones where fog and strong wind are known to occur. The system uses variable traffic signs to communicate changing driving conditions, possible restrictions and other information to motorway users. The A2 motorway mainly runs through the plains and rolling hills of Hrvatsko Zagorje region, although the northernmost sections of the route traverse rugged terrain, requiring a number of viaducts and long tunnels along the route.|$|E
