5|$|In many respects, the YF-22s were {{different}} from production F-22s. Contrary to the F-117 Nighthawk, which was initially difficult to control because of small vertical stabilizers, Lockheed over-specified the fin area on its YF-22. Therefore, the company reduced the size of those on F-22s by 20–30 percent. Lockheed recontoured {{the shape of the}} wing and <b>stabilator</b> trailing edges to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics; the wing and stabilitor sweep was reduced by 6° from 48°. Finally, to improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward 7inches (178mm), and the engine intakes were moved rearward 14inches (356mm).|$|E
25|$|The {{empennage}} of the MiG-21 {{consists of}} a vertical stabilizer, a <b>stabilator</b> and a small fin {{on the bottom of}} the tail to improve yaw control. The vertical stabilizer has a sweep angle of 60° and an area of 5.32m² (on earlier version 3.8m²) and a rudder. The <b>stabilator</b> has a sweep angle of 57°, an area of 3.94m² and a span of 2.6m.|$|E
25|$|The {{new model}} {{incorporated}} {{changes to the}} aircraft's control surfaces, including enlarged and balanced ailerons, {{the addition of a}} rudder anti-servo tab, and a <b>stabilator</b> bobweight.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stabilators</b> were {{developed}} to achieve adequate pitch control in supersonic flight, and are almost universal on modern military combat aircraft. All non-delta-winged supersonic aircraft use <b>stabilators</b> because with conventional control surfaces, shock waves can form past the elevator hinge, causing severe mach tuck.|$|R

50|$|The Skylark is all metal, with a {{steel tube}} {{internal}} structure. It incorporates shrouds, flaps, spoilerons, turbulator control, <b>stabilators,</b> elevances, and spinner duct cooling.|$|R
25|$|Over {{time the}} {{aircraft}} was modified to include IFR avionics, an automatic fuel tank selection and cycling system, airbrakes, a <b>stabilator</b> T-tail, a turbocharged engine and built-in oxygen.|$|E
25|$|The tail {{features}} a rudder mounted with a piano hinge {{on the right}} side only. The elevator is a full flying <b>stabilator</b> and incorporates anti-servo tabs inboard on both sides to increase pitch stick forces. The controls are actuated by dual control sticks and conventional rudder pedals.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve the {{aerodynamics}} of the air-cooled piston engines, the fourth production P-36A (serial 38-004), designated the XP-42, was equipped with a long streamlined cowling resembling that of a liquid-cooled engine. Twelve different designs were tried with little success; although the aircraft was faster than a standard P-36A, engine cooling problems were never resolved. Since the new P-40 was faster, the project was canceled. Late in its service life, the sole XP-42 was fitted with a <b>stabilator</b> and used to study that control configuration.|$|E
5000|$|... an anti-servo tab used to trim some {{elevators}} and <b>stabilators</b> as well {{as increased}} control force feel. Usually controlled by a cockpit wheel or crank.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} control near and above the speed of sound, it is often necessary to use either power operated all-flying tailplanes (<b>stabilators),</b> or delta wings fitted with power operated elevons. Power operation prevents aerodynamic forces overriding the pilots' control inputs.|$|R
50|$|Some aircraft, the Panavia Tornado for example, {{retain a}} very basic hydro-mechanical backup system for limited flight control {{capability}} on losing electrical power; {{in the case of}} the Tornado this allows rudimentary control of the <b>stabilators</b> only for pitch and roll axis movements.|$|R
25|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a swept-wing version of the earlier F9F Panther, in February–March 1948, the design was reconfigured with a T-tail and ultimately a variable-geometry wing. It featured a T-tail, with the horizontal <b>stabilator,</b> a small pivoting center body with a delta servo control at the nose and a larger rear delta main wing, mounted atop the vertical fin. The single turbojet engine was fed by cheek intakes. The high, shoulder-mounted wing could be moved to two positions: a 13.5° sweep for takeoff and landing and a 42.5° sweep for high-speed flight.|$|E
25|$|Another {{critical}} addition {{was the use}} of a power-operated <b>stabilator,</b> {{also known}} as the all-moving tail or flying tail, a key to supersonic flight control which contrasted with traditional hinged tailplanes (horizontal stabilizers) connected mechanically to the pilot's control column. Conventional control surfaces became ineffective at the high subsonic speeds then being achieved by fighters in dives, due to the aerodynamic forces caused by the formation of shockwaves at the hinge and the rearward movement of the centre of pressure, which together could override the control forces that could be applied mechanically by the pilot, hindering recovery from the dive. A major impediment to early transonic flight was control reversal, the phenomenon which caused flight inputs (stick, rudder) to switch direction at high speed; it was the cause of many accidents and near-accidents. An all-flying tail {{is considered to be a}} minimum condition of enabling aircraft to break the transonic barrier safely without a loss of pilot control. The M.52 was the first instance of this solution, which has since gone on to be universally applied upon high-speed aircraft.|$|E

25|$|F-8E(FN) – {{air superiority}} fighter version for the French Navy, {{significantly}} increased wing lift due to greater slat and flap deflection {{and the addition}} of a boundary layer control system, enlarged <b>stabilators,</b> incorporated AN/APQ-104 radar, an upgraded version of AN/APQ-94. A total of 42 built.|$|R
25|$|Canted {{vertical}} stabilizers {{are another}} distinguishing design element, one among several other such elements that enable the Hornet's excellent high {{angle of attack}} ability, including oversized horizontal <b>stabilators,</b> oversized trailing edge flaps that operate as flaperons, large full-length leading-edge flaps and flight control computer programming that multiplies the movement of each control surface at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right. The Hornet's normally high angle of attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV). NASA used the F-18 HARV to demonstrate flight handling characteristics at high angle-of-attack (alpha) of 65–70 degrees using thrust vectoring vanes. F/A-18 <b>stabilators</b> were also used as canards on NASA's F-15S/MTD.|$|R
25|$|A {{proposal}} naval {{version of}} the Su-57 for the Project 23000E or Shtorm supercarrier. Models of the aircraft carrier project are showing Su-57 on board, with folding wings and <b>stabilators.</b> The Su-57 {{should be able to}} use the takeoff ramp as well as the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System.|$|R
500|$|A Spitfire was {{modified}} by the RAE for high-speed {{testing of the}} <b>stabilator</b> (then known as the [...] "flying tail") of the Miles M.52 supersonic research aircraft. RAE test pilot Eric Brown stated that he tested this successfully during October and November 1944, attaining Mach 0.86 in a dive.|$|E
500|$|The F-22 {{had several}} design changes from the YF-22. The swept-back {{angle of the}} leading edge was {{decreased}} from 48° to 42°, while the vertical stabilizers were shifted rearward and decreased in area by 20%. To improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward , and the engine intakes moved rearward [...] The shapes of the wing and <b>stabilator</b> trailing edges were refined to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics. Increasing weight during development caused slight reductions in range and aerodynamic performance.|$|E
500|$|After {{extensive}} {{wind tunnel}} testing, the <b>stabilator</b> was mounted {{at the top}} of the fin for optimum stability and control about the pitch axis. Because the vertical tail fin was only slightly shorter than the length of each wing and nearly as aerodynamically effective, it could act as a wing on rudder application (a phenomenon known as [...] "Dutch roll"). To offset this effect, the wings were angled downward to give 10° anhedral. The rudder was manually operated and supplemented by a small yaw damper surface mounted at the bottom of the fin.|$|E
50|$|A canard is an {{elevator}} control surface placed {{forward of the}} wings. Sometimes, as with the B-1B, they are simply used to stabilize flexible portions of the fuselage or provide very minute attitude changes, but they are used often {{as a supplement to}} or full replacement of tail-mounted <b>stabilators.</b>|$|R
5|$|Another {{idea that}} McDonnell {{proposed}} was {{a variation of}} a carrier-based Phantom, {{with the goal of}} improving catapult performance and lowering approach speeds. The F-4(HL) would have had a longer fuselage and wingspan, with less sweep, <b>stabilators</b> with increased area and air intakes with auxiliary blow-in doors to increase airflow at low speeds. This proposal was not taken forward.|$|R
5000|$|Several modern fighter {{aircraft}} {{may have}} no ailerons on their wings but provide roll control with an all moving horizontal tailplane. When horizontal tailplane <b>stabilators</b> can move differentially to perform the roll control function of ailerons, as they do on some modern fighter aircraft, they are termed 'tailerons' or 'rolling tails'. Tailerons additionally permit wider flaps on the aircraft's wings.|$|R
500|$|The chassis {{was based}} on a pressed steel ladder frame with channel-section side members and {{fabricated}} and tubular cross members. Suspension was by semi-elliptic leaf springs and Watson <b>Stabilator</b> dampers front and rear, with a tubular beam axle at the front and a live axle and radius rods at the rear. The standard wheelbase was , [...] with a wheelbase of [...] available for seven-passenger bodies. The front and rear tracks were both [...] wide. Center-locking wire wheels with 5" [...] x 33" [...] tires were used front and rear.|$|E
500|$|The YF-16 was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} General Dynamics engineers led by Robert H. Widmer. [...] The first YF-16 was rolled out on 13 December 1973, and its 90-minute maiden flight was made at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at Edwards AFB, California, on 2 February 1974. Its actual first flight occurred accidentally during a high-speed taxi test on 20 January 1974. While gathering speed, a roll-control oscillation caused a fin of the port-side wingtip-mounted missile and then the starboard <b>stabilator</b> to scrape the ground, and the aircraft then began to veer off the runway. The test pilot, Phil Oestricher, decided to lift off to avoid a potential crash, safely landing six minutes later. The slight damage was quickly repaired and the official first flight occurred on time. The YF-16's first supersonic flight was accomplished on 5 February 1974, and the second YF-16 prototype first flew on 9 May 1974. This was followed by the first flights of Northrop's YF-17 prototypes on 9 June and 21 August 1974, respectively. During the flyoff, the YF-16s completed 330 sorties for a total of 417 flight hours; the YF-17s flew 288 sorties, covering 345 hours.|$|E
2500|$|The Cherry is a {{low wing}} monoplane. [...] It has a wood-framed {{fuselage}} and wings with wooden spars, styrofoam cores and glass fibre covering. The inner sections of the wings have constant chord and carry flaps; the outer sections are straight tapered with ailerons. [...] The wings can be removed rapidly for transport. The tail surfaces are straight tapered and the <b>stabilator</b> is fitted with a full-span anti-servo tab.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance of the Phantoms was {{undertaken}} by No.482 Squadron and No.3 Aircraft Depot, {{both of which}} were located at Amberley. In addition to routine servicing, these units modified the Phantoms' AN/APQ-120 radars during early 1971. In response to problems detected during maintenance, RAAF technical personnel checked all the aircraft for defects to their emergency flap system in September 1971 and used X-ray testing to detect any cracks in their <b>stabilators</b> during early 1972.|$|R
50|$|The F-15 STOL/MTD tested ways to {{land and}} take off from wet, bomb-damaged runways. The {{aircraft}} used a combination of reversible engine thrust, jet nozzles that could be deflected by 20 degrees, and canard foreplanes. Pitch vectoring/reversing nozzles and canard foreplanes were fitted to the F-15 in 1988. NASA acquired the plane in 1993 and replaced the engines with Pratt & Whitney F100-229 engines with Pitch/Yaw vectoring nozzles. The canard foreplanes were derived from the F/A-18's <b>stabilators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On many {{low-speed}} aircraft, a {{trim tab}} is {{present at the}} rear of the elevator, which the pilot can adjust to eliminate forces on the control column at the desired attitude and airspeed. Supersonic aircraft have all-moving tailplanes (<b>stabilators),</b> because shock waves generated on the horizontal stabilizer greatly reduced the effectiveness of hinged elevators. Delta winged aircraft combine ailerons and elevators [...] - and their respective control inputs - [...] into one control surface called elevon.|$|R
2500|$|The DH.77 {{was a small}} low-winged {{lightweight}} monoplane, {{of mixed}} metal-and-wood construction, powered by a 300hp (224kW) Napier Rapier air-cooled H-engine, which offered very low frontal area to minimise drag. [...] The wing was braced with distinctive bracing struts above the wing, while the aircraft had a wide-track fixed tailwheel undercarriage. It was fitted with large span ailerons and a <b>stabilator</b> to give good control characteristics and spin recovery. Armament was the normal pair of synchronised Vickers machine guns, mounted {{on each side of}} the cockpit.|$|E
2500|$|The F-18, {{initially}} {{known as}} McDonnell Douglas Model 267, was drastically modified from the YF-17. For carrier operations, the airframe, undercarriage, and tailhook were strengthened, folding wings and catapult attachments were added, and {{the landing gear}} widened. To meet Navy range and reserves requirements, McDonnell increased fuel capacity by , by enlarging the dorsal spine and adding a 96-gallon fuel tank to each wing. A [...] "snag" [...] {{was added to the}} wing's leading edge and stabilators to prevent an Aeroelastic flutter discovered in the F-15 <b>stabilator.</b> The wings and stabilators were enlarged, the aft fuselage widened by , and the engines canted outward at the front. These changes added [...] to the gross weight, bringing it to [...] The YF-17's control system was replaced with a fully digital fly-by-wire system with quadruple-redundancy, the first to be installed in a production fighter.|$|E
5000|$|For the Cherokee family, Piper {{used their}} {{traditional}} flight control configuration. The horizontal tail is a <b>stabilator</b> with an antiservo tab (sometimes termed an antibalance tab). The antiservo tab {{moves in the}} same direction of the <b>stabilator</b> movement, making pitch control [...] "heavier" [...] as the <b>stabilator</b> moves out of the trimmed position. Flaps can extend up to 40°, and 25° flaps are normally used for a short- or soft-field takeoff. The ailerons, flaps, <b>stabilator,</b> and <b>stabilator</b> trim are all controlled using cables and pulleys.|$|E
500|$|The {{first of}} two known {{versions}} of the Su-33, the twin-seat Su-33UB, made its first flight in April 1999. The aircraft, piloted by Viktor Pugachyov and Sergey Melnikov, flew for 40 minutes near Ramenskoye Airport. The Su-33UB (Initially named as Su-27KUB, [...] "Korabelny Uchebno-Boevo", or [...] "carrier combat trainer") was planned to be a trainer, but {{with the potential to}} fill other roles. Notable improvements over the Su-33 included a revised forward fuselage and leading edge slats, bigger wings and <b>stabilators</b> ...|$|R
5|$|The Sukhoi Su-33 (-33; NATO {{reporting}} name: Flanker-D) is an all-weather carrier-based twin-engine {{air superiority}} fighter designed by Sukhoi and manufactured by Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association, {{derived from the}} Su-27 and initially known as the Su-27K. Compared with the Su-27, the Su-33 has a strengthened undercarriage and structure, folding wings and <b>stabilators,</b> all for carrier operations. The Su-33 has canards and its wings are larger than the Su-27 for increased lift. The Su-33 has upgraded engines and a twin nose wheel, and is air refuelable.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Kulbit" [...] (also {{known as}} the [...] "Frolov chakra") is an aerial {{maneuver}} developed by Russian pilots in which the aircraft performs an extremely tight loop, often not much wider than {{the length of the}} aircraft itself. It differs from the traditional inside loop as it uses post-stall maneuvering capabilities,a type of supermaneuverability. Like most post-stall maneuvers, it demonstrates pitch control outside the normal flight envelope wherein pitch control is made possible by having aerodynamic flow over the aircraft's elevators or <b>stabilators.</b>|$|R
