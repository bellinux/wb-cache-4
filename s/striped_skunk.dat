About thirty live in the park year round, including the barred owl, Carolina chickadee, red-tailed hawk, and wild turkey. The peregrine falcon was reintroduced into the park in the mid-1990s and by the end of the 20th century there were numerous nesting pairs in the park. Thirty-{{two species of}} fish have been documented in the park, including brook trout, longnose and eastern blacknose dace, and the bluehead chub.|$|E
25|$|In the Great Plains, {{the prairie}} dog is a {{keystone}} species. Studies comparing species abundances {{in areas of}} colonization against areas with no prairie dog colonization show clear evidence that the prairie dog does {{have a significant impact}} on its surroundings by altering vegetation and therefore affecting habitat and food availability for other species. There is a great mosaic of vegetative diversity within the Great Plains due to the prairie dog’s extensive grazing on long grasses. This mosaic supports a variety of small mammals. In addition to altering vegetation, the prairie dog also creates habitat for many other organisms by creating extensive tunnel systems that other small mammals such as the desert cottontail, <b>striped</b> <b>skunk</b> and deer mouse use for shelter. A strong characteristic of keystone species is their ability to create and modify other organism’s habitats and it is evident that the prairie dog does this. In conclusion, the prairie dog is an iconic animal species North America. Its close link to the ecology and structure of the Great Plains make it the defining keystone species of the ecoregion.|$|E
25|$|The Aspen Parkland is {{agricultural}} land. The {{most prominent}} wildlife species {{which may be}} found are coyote (Canis latrans), hare, <b>striped</b> <b>skunk</b> (Mephitis mephitis), North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), Richardson's ground squirrel (Spermophilus richardsonii), snowshoe hare, cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), northern pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides), Franklin's ground squirrel (Spermophilus franklinii) and red fox. The Aspen Parkland is the environment of choice for the white-tailed deer. The Moist Mixed Grassland ecoregion is characterized by white-tailed deer, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), coyote, rabbit, American badger (Taxidea taxus), red bat (Lasiurus borealis) and ground squirrel such as black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus). Animal populations of the Mixed Grassland enumerate pronghorn, white-tailed and mule deer, long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis), small-footed myotis (Myotis subulatus), jack rabbit, coyote, Richardson's ground squirrel. The only Canadian site of black-tailed prairie dog is in the Mixed Grassland prairie ecoregion. The raised elevation of the Cypress Upland results in white spruce and aspen forests and an ecoregion more resembling the boreal forested areas than the prairielands. Moose, pronghorn, mule and white-tailed deer, elk, rabbit, and ground squirrel coyote are common in this ecoregion.|$|E
40|$|In North America, {{expansion}} of agriculture {{has resulted in}} the fragmentation of grasslands. Consequently, waterfowl populations have declined due to predation on nests. Predation on nests is an old evolutionary force affecting waterfowl, but the recent fragmentation of grasslands may have yielded a situation to which waterfowl are not yet adapted. In southcentral Saskatchewan, <b>striped</b> <b>skunks</b> are a major predator, and the interactions between fragmentation, <b>striped</b> <b>skunks,</b> and waterfowl are unknown, and were the major goal of my thesis. First, I examined the patterns of den site selection in <b>striped</b> <b>skunks.</b> Farmsteads are the most preferred habitat for den sites, and that within farmsteads, <b>striped</b> <b>skunks</b> denned under buildings. Alternatively, resting sites were preferably located in farmsteads and wetlands, whereas managed nesting areas, woodland, and cropland were avoided. When foraging within their home ranges, <b>striped</b> <b>skunks</b> preferred habitats such as wetland and woodland where their main food items, insects and small mammals, are most abundant. Cropland contained little food, and was strongly avoided. Use of specific habitats decreased with distance from the habitat edge, suggesting that large patches of nesting habitat may provide a refuge for ground nesting birds. Lastly, I performed a field experiment to assess the effects of nest density and nearest neighbours on nest predation. Density effects did not occur during the early breeding seasons of waterfowl (May 15 -June 13), even across a 10 -fold difference in nest density (2. 5 - 25 nests/ha). However, density effects were significant in the late breeding season (June 15 -July 14). Nearest neighbour effects were present at intermediate and high densities, but rarely observed at low density. Also, nearest neighbour effects occurred faster during the late breeding season, suggesting that <b>striped</b> <b>skunks</b> recognized and keyed on high-density nesting patches. This confirms that at current nest density (typically...|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} related species, western spotted skunks possess {{a pair of}} large musk glands that open just inside the anus, and which can spray their {{contents}} through muscular action. The musk {{is similar to that}} of <b>striped</b> <b>skunks,</b> but contains 2-phenylethanethiol as an additional component, and lacks some of the compounds produced by the other species. These differences are said to give western spotted skunk musk a more pungent odor, but not to spread as widely as that of <b>striped</b> <b>skunks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.) and garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) prey on black-tailed jackrabbit young. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) and <b>striped</b> <b>skunks</b> (Mephitis mephitis) {{may also}} capture young.|$|R
500|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} may behave aggressively when on the defensive, with mammalogist Vernon Orlando Bailey {{describing}} the species as [...] "morose and savage."

40|$|Cardiac {{disease is}} a common finding in small mammals but it is rarely {{reported}} in <b>striped</b> <b>skunks</b> (Mephitis mephitis). The aim of this survey was to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac disease in <b>striped</b> <b>skunks</b> and to characterize the types of cardiac disease that might be present. In April 2010, a questionnaire was sent to veterinarians in zoologic collections with membership in the International Species Inventory System.

2500|$|Meadow voles are an {{important}} prey for many hawks, owls, and mammalian carnivores, and they are also taken by some snakes. [...] Almost all species of raptors take microtine (Microtus spp.) rodents as prey. Birds not usually considered predators of mice do take voles; examples include gulls (Larus spp.), northern shrike (Larius borealis), black-billed magpie (Pica pica), common raven (Corvus corax), American crow (C. brachyrhynchos), great blue heron (Ardea herodias), and American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus). In Ohio, meadow voles comprised 90% of the individual prey remains in long-eared owl (Asio otus) pellets on a relict wet prairie, and in Wisconsin, meadow voles comprised 95% of short-eared owl (A. flammeus) prey. [...] Most mammalian predators take microtine prey. The American short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) is major predator; meadow voles avoid areas frequented by short-tailed shrews.

40|$|Background: <b>Striped</b> <b>skunks</b> (Mephitis mephitis) are {{susceptible}} to infection with some influenza A viruses. However, the viral shedding capability of this peri-domestic mammal and its potential role in influenza A virus ecology are largely undetermined. Methodology/Principal Findings: <b>Striped</b> <b>skunks</b> were experimentally infected with a low pathogenic (LP) H 4 N 6 avian influenza virus (AIV) and monitored for 20 days post infection (DPI). All of the skunks exposed to H 4 N 6 AIV shed large quantities of viral RNA, as detected by real-time RT-PCR and confirmed for live virus with virus isolation, from nasal washes and oral swabs (maximum # 106. 02 PCR EID 50 equivalent/mL and # 10 5. 19 PCR EID 50 equivalent/mL, respectively). Some evidence of potential fecal shedding was also noted. Following necropsy on 20 DPI, viral RNA was detected in the nasal turbinates of one individual. All treatment animals yielded evidence of a serological response by 20 DPI. Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that <b>striped</b> <b>skunks</b> {{have the potential to}} shed large quantities of viral RNA through the oral and nasal routes following exposure to a LP AIV. Considering the peri-domestic nature of these animals, along with the duration of shedding observed in this species, their presence on poultry and waterfowl operations could influence influenza A virus epidemiology.
