40|$|Gammarus lawrencianus is classed as {{a genuine}} brackish-water {{species on the}} basis of the {{survival}} of juveniles, developing eggs and of reproducing adult females. This is consistent with its estuarine distribution in the NW Atlantic.

40|$|The {{distribution}} {{and function of}} the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in the crab Pachygrapsus crassipes was investigated. Carbonic anhydrase was found in gill epithelial tissue {{but not in the}} haemolymph, muscle, heart, hepatopancreas or gonads of male crabs. Enzyme activity was completely inhibited in vitro by 2 x IO ~ 4 M sodium acetazolamide (Diamox). Radiolabelled Diamox (2 x IO ~ 4 M) in sea water was found to equilibrate with the intact crab's haemolymph within one hour. Haemolymph CO 2 content, pH and chloride ion concentration were measured in crabs acclimated to different <b>salinities</b> and exposed to 2 x IO ~ 4 M Diamox. Haemolymph CO 2 content increased at all <b>salinities,</b> especially low <b>salinities,</b> while pH remained unchanged, except at low <b>salinities</b> where it increased. Diamox impaired the regulation of haemolymph chloride at low <b>salinities,</b> but had no effect on chloride regulation at high <b>salinities.</b> Measurement of O 2 uptake (estimating CO 2 production) in crabs before and after Diamox exposure confirmed that elevated haemolymph CO 2 was not due to increases in tissue CO 2 production...|$|R
40|$|<b>Salinities</b> in some normally-closed {{estuaries}} in {{the central}} south coast of Western Australia are now frequently becoming highly elevated. This is due to: (1) high evaporation rates in water volumes that, by summer, are already low {{as a result of}} atypically dry winters; and (2) increased salt run-off following vegetation clearing in the catchments. A few black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) died in the basin and lower reaches of the main tributary of Culham inlet when <b>salinities</b> reached [similar] 77 and 67, respectively, and an estimated 1. 3 million black bream died in the tributary during the next two months when <b>salinities</b> continued to increase. All black bream in the basin and the lower reaches of the tributary of another estuary were apparently killed when <b>salinities</b> reached [similar] 83 1385. It is proposed that A. butcheri becomes stressed at <b>salinities</b> of 60 and typically die before they reach [similar] 85. In both estuaries, a rock bar in the tributary prevented black bream from moving to refugia in upstream areas where <b>salinities</b> were lower...|$|R
5|$|Leggetts Creek has {{relatively}} {{high levels of}} total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity of the creek ranged from 538.00 to 979.50 micro-siemens per centimeter, {{with an average of}} 677.54 micro-siemens per centimeter. The concentration of dissolved solids ranged from 50.00 to 680.00 milligrams per liter, with an average of 411.96 milligrams per liter. The creek is fairly alkaline, with a pH ranging from 7.64 to 9.23 and averaging 8.20. The concentration of <b>salinity</b> in the creek averages 345 parts per million, but reaches levels as high as 435 parts per million and as low as 280 parts per million.

5|$|Reef {{environments in}} Biscayne National Park have seen declines in species {{richness}} and diversity across all fish species from 1977 to 1981 to 2006–2007. A sampling program showed declines at all sampling sites. A correlation has been posited between the observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout the Florida Reef tract {{and the decline}} in fish species. Declines in populations were noted in both gamefish and in fish species not exposed to fishing pressure. Algal cover has increased as coral has declined, so that coral-dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased. Increased overall <b>salinity</b> and changing <b>salinity</b> gradients in Biscayne Bay may also play a role, while polychlorinated biphenyl and mercury contamination have been noted in fish samples.|$|E

40|$|Aquatic {{animals can}} often undergo {{substantial}} physiological responses to salinity; however, associated lipid/fatty acid alterations to their various tissues have received little attention. To investigate this, we measured {{the growth of}} mud crab, Scylla serrata, juveniles over two moults (duration of 23 - 60 days) at <b>salinities</b> of 4, 12, 20, 28, 36 and 44 ‰ (30 replicates/ treatment). After the second moult, 6 -day post moult crabs were sampled for hepatosomatic index (HSI), haemolymph 15 osmolality, Na⁺, K⁺ and Ca²⁺ levels, anterior/posterior gill Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity {{as well as the}} lipid/fatty acid composition of the anterior and posterior gills, hepatopancreas and muscle. High <b>salinities</b> of 36 and 44 ‰ significantly lowered crab growth and HSI (p< 0. 01). S. serrata strongly hyper-regulated haemolymph osmolality and ions likely due to significantly enhanced posterior gill Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity. At decreasing <b>salinities,</b> eicosapentaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, n- 3 and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) significantly increased (p< 0. 05), likely to maintain Na⁺/K⁺- 20 ATPase activity via increased membrane fluidity. Muscle and hepatopancreas n- 3 /n- 6 PUFA ratios significantly decreased (p< 0. 05) at increasing <b>salinities</b> indicating possible fatty acid metabolic modifications. Results indicate that S. serrata juveniles are well adapted to low <b>salinities,</b> with higher <b>salinities</b> likely reducing their metabolism, reflected by lower growth, HSI and higher posterior gill and hepatopancreatic triacylglycerol...|$|R
5|$|Sea snakes do {{not occur}} in the Atlantic Ocean. It is thought that Pelamis would be found there {{were it not for}} the cold {{currents}} off Namibia and western South Africa that keep it from crossing into the eastern South Atlantic, or south of 5° latitude along the South American west coast. Sea snakes {{do not occur}} in the Red Sea, believed to be due to its increased <b>salinity,</b> so no danger exists of them crossing through the Suez Canal. A lack of <b>salinity</b> is also thought to be the reason why Pelamis has not crossed into the Caribbean via the Panama Canal.|$|E
5|$|Seawater is {{invariably}} salty and, {{although its}} degree of saltiness (<b>salinity)</b> can vary, about 90% {{of the water}} in the ocean has 34– (1.2 oz.) of dissolved solids per liter, producing a <b>salinity</b> between 3.4 and 3.5%. To easily describe small differences, however, oceanographers usually express <b>salinity</b> as a millage (‰) or part per thousand (ppt) instead of using percents. The surface <b>salinity</b> of waters in the Northern Hemisphere are generally closer to the 34‰ mark, while those in the South are closer to 35‰. The solutes in ocean water come both from inflowing river water and from the ocean floor. The relative composition of the solutes is stable throughout the world's oceans: sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) make up about 85%. Other solutes include metal ions such as magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) and negative ions such as sulfate (SO₄), carbonate (CO₃), and bromides. In the absence of other pollution, seawater would not be harmful to drink except that it is much too saline; similarly, it cannot be used for irrigating most plants without being desalinated. For scientific and technical purposes, a standardized form of artificial seawater is often used.|$|E
5|$|The Nueces estuary {{provides}} an ecosystem {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. However, since the construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985, freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River, increasing the bay's <b>salinity,</b> and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat. In response, the City of Corpus Christi, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay. The Odem Bay extension is low in <b>salinity</b> and serves as a nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. Oyster beds are common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout, black drum, flounder and redfish. Such finfish must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival.|$|E

50|$|Phosphorus is {{generally}} a limiting nutrient in the ocean. In Pacific Northwest estuaries, {{an important source}} of phosphorus comes from ocean upwelling in the summer (see below).

5|$|The {{northern}} arm of {{the lake}} has a much higher <b>salinity,</b> {{to the point that}} the native brine shrimp cannot survive in its waters. In the southern portion, where the vast majority of the fresh water inlets are found, the salt level can dip below what is necessary for the brine shrimp to survive, while water in the northern bay is too salty. The <b>salinity</b> of northern {{arm of the}} lake will likely drop as lower <b>salinity</b> from the southern arm of the lake flows into the northern arm. The brine shrimp harvesting industry could benefit from the causeway allowing a freer flow of water. There were concerns from the brine shrimp harvesting industry that the lake conditions in the southern arm of the lake were becoming too saline for the brine shrimp due to several years of lower precipitation in the lake's watershed. The precipitation in the watershed has been above normal for the current water year that begins its tracking October 1, 2016. This additional precipitation has allowed the levels of both arms of the lake to rise, and at least for the near future the conditions for a healthy brine shrimp population seem good.|$|E

5|$|Owing to {{the present}} state of {{continental}} drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). <b>Salinity</b> in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in <b>salinity</b> and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun.

5|$|South Florida is a {{transitional}} zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical ecozones, {{resulting in a}} wide variety of plant and animal life. The intersection of ecozones brings opportunities for visitors to see species, particularly birds, that are not seen elsewhere in North America. The park includes four distinct ecosystems, each supporting its own flora and fauna. Mangrove swamp, lagoon, island key and offshore reef habitats provide diversity for many species. In this semi-tropical environment, the seasons are differentiated mainly by rainfall. Warm to hot and wet summers bring occasional tropical storms. Though only marginally cooler, the winters tend to be relatively drier. Bay <b>salinity</b> varies accordingly, with lower <b>salinity</b> levels in the wet summer, trending to more fresh water on the west side where new fresh water flows in.|$|E

5|$|The Pacific blue-eye {{is found}} in loose schools of tens to {{thousands}} of fish. They are generally found in the mid- to upper water column within 1 metre (3 ft) of the riverbank and often close to underwater cover. The Pacific blue-eye is euryhaline—it can survive {{in a wide range}} of water salinities from fresh-water to marine environments. It responds to changes in <b>salinity</b> (and resulting change in buoyancy) by changing the volume of its swim bladder, which takes up to 6 hours and 40 minutes when <b>salinity</b> is reduced and around 5 hours when it is increased. In the meantime, the fish can swim with a head-up or head-down posture, which either increases or decreases buoyancy respectively. This adaptation helps the fish in the range of salinities it encounters in its estuarine environment.|$|E
