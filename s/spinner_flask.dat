MSCs harvested from male Sprague-Dawley rats were culture expanded, seeded on three-dimensional porous 75 : 25 poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) biodegradable scaffolds, and cultured for 21 days under static conditions or in two model bioreactors (a <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> and a rotating wall vessel) that enhance mixing of the media and provide better nutrient transport to the seeded cells. The <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> culture demonstrated a 60 % enhanced proliferation at the end of the first week when compared to static culture. On day 14, all cell/polymer constructs exhibited their maximum alkaline phosphatase activity (AP). Cell/polymer constructs cultured in the <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> had 2. 4 times higher AP activity than constructs cultured under static conditions on day 14. The total osteocalcin (OC) secretion in the <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> culture was 3. 5 times higher than the static culture, with a peak OC secretion occurring on day 18. No considerable AP activity and OC secretion were detected in the rotating wall vessel culture throughout the 21 -day culture period. The <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> culture had the highest calcium content at day 14. On day 21, the calcium deposition in the <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> culture was 6. 6 times higher than the static cultured constructs and over 30 times higher than the rotating wall vessel culture. Histological sections showed concentration of cells and mineralization at the exterior of the foams at day 21. This phenomenon may arise from the potential existence of nutrient concentration gradients at the interior of the scaffolds. The better mixing provided in the <b>spinner</b> <b>flask,</b> external to the outer surface of the scaffolds, may explain the accelerated proliferation and differentiation of marrow stromal osteoblasts, and the localization of the enhanced mineralization on the external surface of the scaffolds.

40|$|The {{successful}} engraftment of pluripotent {{stem cells}} has revolutionised regenerative medicine {{in the treatment of}} many degenerative diseases and injuries. For many years, bioreactors have been widely used to improve cell culturing efficiency. Although the importance of mechanical stresses on cell culture has been often reported in the literature, little attention has been given to understanding the fluid dynamics aspect of the bioreactor. This thesis demonstrates the use of experimental fluid dynamics in uncovering the underlying physics of the flow mechanics in bioreactors. The first section of the study comprised the flow visualisation in a rotating-top disk cylindrical bioreactor, with the height-radius ratio of 2. Qualitative analysis determined the effect on the flow when the density of the dye injection was varied. The injection of a relatively denser fluid created a buoyancy force downward, which counteracted the meridional recirculation in the cylinder and thus enhanced the formation of a vortex breakdown bubble. On the other hand, the injection of a lighter fluid did not destroy the vortex breakdown. However, for large enough density differences (larger than 0. 03 %), the lighter fluid was able to pierce through the bubble and led to a new structure of the vortex breakdown. Translating this knowledge to the use of microcarriers in a rotating lid bioreactor, it is expected the microcarriers will accumulate and thicken at the centre of the container. Then, the behaviour is followed by destabilisation of the flow with an oscillatory effect creating a phenomenon similar to dense dye experiments. The flow field within a <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> at varying speeds (10 RPM to 80 RPM) and impeller positions was characterised experimentally. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was employed to visualise the fluid flow and calculate the stresses and vorticities associated with the flow within the flask. The highest shear stress region was observed {{at the base of the}} <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> due to fluid-wall interaction. The study provides an overview of the fluid structure within the <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> in the meridional and azimuthal planes. Furthermore, the quantitative results of this study gave an accurate numerical stress margin for the given impeller speeds. The optimum flow condition for culturing mouse induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) was investigated. It was found that the mouse iPSCs achieved the optimum number of cells over 7 days in a 25 RPM suspension culture. This condition translated to a 0. 0984 Pa maximum shear stress caused by the interaction of the fluid flow with the bottom surface. However, negative cell growth was obtained in the 28 RPM culture condition. Such a narrow margin demonstrated that mouse iPSCs cultured on microcarriers are very sensitive to mechanical forces. This study provides insight to biomechanical parameters, specifically the shear stress distribution, for a commonly-used <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> over a wide range of Reynolds number. Additionally, these results provide estimates of the biomechanical properties within the type of <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> used in many published cell studies. In an effort to measure three-dimensional (3 D) velocity fields in biological flows, a correlation-based approach, termed Holographic Correlation Velocimetry (HCV), was developed. The direct flow reconstruction approach developed here allows for measurements at high seeding densities. Moreover, because the system is based on in-line holography, it is very efficient with regards to the use of light, as it does not rely on side scattering. This efficiency makes the system appropriate for high-speed flows and low exposure times, which is essential for imaging dynamic systems. The method was rigorously tested, validated and applied to measure flows in a cuvette and a <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> bioreactor. This thesis provides invaluable information and deep insight into flow behaviour within bioreactors. Furthermore, the wide range of variables covered in the study will allow the estimation of the magnitude of mechanical forces to be made, thus improving the understanding of the relations between mechanical forces and the culture outcome. The proposed imaging technique will allow thorough characterisation of the biomechanical parameters and define the design criteria for future bioreactor development...|$|E

For the murine hybridoma cell line S 3 H 5 /γ 2 bA 2, critical inoculum density (cID) and serum requirement for growth were inversely related for cultivation in both T <b>flasks</b> and <b>spinner</b> <b>flasks.</b> In <b>spinner</b> <b>flasks,</b> an inoculum density of 10 6 cells/ml was necessary for the cells to grow in RPMI 1640 medium without serum supplement, and an inoculum density of 10 3 cell/ml was necessary in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % serum. In T flasks, where the local cell density is higher than in <b>spinner</b> <b>flasks,</b> an inoculum density of 10 6 cells/ml was necessary for the cells to grow in RPMI 1640 medium without serum supplement, and an inoculum density of 1 cell/ml was also necessary in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % serum. Further, immobilized cells at high local cell density could grow under conditions where cells in T flasks at corresponding overall cell density could not grow. The cells at high inoculum density were less sensitive to shear induced by mechanical agitation than the cells at low inoculum density. Taken together these observations support the existence of secreted aGF(s) by the hybridoma cell line used.

30|$|There {{are many}} types of 3 D stem cell culture systems, which can include plate or culture dish, <b>spinner</b> <b>flask,</b> {{rotating}} wall vessel (RWV), and perfusion bioreactor system among others. The plate or culture dish is {{the most widely used}} system because it is low-cost and easy to use.

When compared with the culture dish system, the <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> and rotating wall vessel offer improvements with respect to the quality and efficiency of cell culture, as they promote the convection of the culture medium by stirring. The RWV is composed of two horizontal concentric cylinders, and the gas inside the column can be freely exchanged through a semi-permeable membrane. The perfusion bioreactor system has become more popular in stem cell engineering projects. The perfusion bioreactor system maintains a balanced environment by constantly refreshing the culture solution thus reducing the likelihood of contamination. Despite the advances in stem cell 3 D culture systems, investigators continue to identify new methods to culture cells more efficiently.|$|E

40|$|Natural bone {{consists}} of cortical and trabecular morphologies, the latter having variable pore sizes. This study aims at engineering different bone-like structures using scaffolds with small pores (112 - 224 µm) in diameter {{on one side}} and large pores (400 - 500 µm) on the other, while keeping scaffold porosities constant among groups. We hypothesized that tissue engineered bone-like structure resulting from silk fibroin (SF) implants is pre-determined by the scaffolds' geometry. To test this hypothesis, SF scaffolds with different pore diameters were prepared and seeded with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). As compared to static seeding, dynamic cell seeding in <b>spinner</b> <b>flasks</b> resulted in equal cell viability and proliferation, and better cell distribution throughout the scaffold as visualized by histology and confocal microscopy, and was, therefore, selected for subsequent differentiation studies. Differentiation of hMSC in osteogenic cell culture medium in <b>spinner</b> <b>flasks</b> for 3 and 5 weeks resulted in increased alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition when compared to control medium.

Here we have demonstrated and explained in detail, for the first time, the amenability of the automated ambr 15 cell culture microbioreactor system for the development of scalable adherent human mesenchymal multipotent stromal/stem cell (hMSC) microcarrier culture processes. This was achieved by first improving suspension and mixing of the microcarriers and then improving cell attachment thereby reducing the initial growth lag phase. The latter was achieved by using only 50 % of the final working volume of medium for the first 24 h and using an intermittent agitation strategy. These changes resulted in > 150 % increase in viable cell density after 24 h compared to the original process (no agitation for 24 h and 100 % working volume). Using the same methodology as in the ambr 15, similar improvements were obtained with larger scale <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> studies. Finally, this improved bioprocess methodology based on a serum-based medium was applied to a serum-free process in the ambr 15, resulting in > 250 % increase in yield compared to the serum-based process. At both scales, the agitation used during culture was the minimum required for microcarrier suspension, NJS. The use of the ambr 15, with its improved control compared to the <b>spinner</b> <b>flask,</b> reduced the coefficient of variation on viable cell density in the serum containing medium from 7. 65 % to 4. 08 %, and the switch to serum free further reduced these to 1. 06 % and 0. 54 % respectively.

This was achieved by first improving suspension and mixing of the microcarriers and then improving cell attachment thereby reducing the initial growth lag phase. The latter was achieved by using only 50 % of the final working volume of medium for the first 24 [*]h and using an intermittent agitation strategy. These changes resulted in[*]>[*] 150 % increase in viable cell density after 24 [*]h compared to the original process (no agitation for 24 [*]h and 100 % working volume). Using the same methodology as in the ambr 15, similar improvements were obtained with larger scale <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> studies. Finally, this improved bioprocess methodology based on a serum-based medium was applied to a serum-free process in the ambr 15, resulting in[*]>[*] 250 % increase in yield compared to the serum-based process. At both scales, the agitation used during culture was the minimum required for microcarrier suspension, NJS. The use of the ambr 15, with its improved control compared to the <b>spinner</b> <b>flask,</b> reduced the coefficient of variation on viable cell density in the serum containing medium from 7. 65 % to 4. 08 %, and the switch to serum free further reduced these to 1. 06 % and 0. 54 % respectively. The combination of both serum-free and automated processing improved the reproducibility more than 10 -fold compared to the serum-based, manual <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> process. The findings of this study demonstrate that the ambr 15 microbioreactor is an effective tool for bioprocess development of hMSC microcarrier cultures and that a combination of serum-free medium, control and automation improves both process yield and consistency...|$|E
40|$|The use of mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) in tissue repair and {{regeneration}} despite their multipotentiality {{has been limited}} by their cell source quantity and decelerating proliferative yield efficiency. A study was thus undertaken to determine the feasibility of using microcarrier beads in <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> cultures for MSCs expansion and {{compared to that of}} conventional monolayer cultures and static microcarrier cultures. Isolation and characterization of bone marrow derived MSCs were conducted from six adult New Zealand white rabbits. Analysis of cell morphology on microcarriers and culture plates at different time points (D 0, D 3, D 10, D 14) during cell culture were performed using scanning electron microscopy and bright field microscopy. Cell proliferation rates and cell number were measured over a period of 14 days, respectively followed by post-expansion characterization. MTT proliferation assay demonstrated a 3. 20 fold increase in cell proliferation rates in MSCs cultured on microcarriers in <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> as compared to monolayer cultures (p < 0. 05). Cell counts at day 14 were higher in those seeded on stirred microcarrier cultures (6. 24 +/- 0. 0420 cells/ml) x 10 (5) as compared to monolayer cultures (0. 22 +/- 0. 004 cells/ml) x 10 (5) and static microcarrier cultures (0. 20 +/- 0. 002 cells/ml) x 10 (5). Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated an increase in cell colonization of the cells on the microcarriers in stirred cultures. Bead-expanded MSCs were successfully differentiated into osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages. This system offers an improved and efficient alternative for culturing MSCs with preservation to their phenotype and multipotentiality...|$|E

In the present study, the reduced fluid shear, high-axial mixing environment provided by a wavy-walled bioreactor was exploited in the cultivation of cartilage constructs using polyglycolic acid scaffolds seeded with bovine articular chondrocytes. Increased growth as defined by weight, cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition was observed in cartilage constructs from wavy-walled bioreactors in comparison with those from spinner flasks cultured under the same conditions. The wet weight composition of 4 -week constructs from the wavy-walled bioreactor was similar to that of <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> constructs, but the former were 60 % heavier due to equally higher incorporation of extracellular matrix and 30 % higher cell population. It is most likely that increased construct matrix incorporation was a result of increased mitotic activity of chondrocytes cultured in the environment of the wavy-walled bioreactor. A layer of elongated cells embedded in type I collagen formed at the periphery of wavy-walled bioreactor and <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> constructs, possibly as a response to local shear forces. On the basis of the robustness and reproducibility of the extracellular matrix composition of cartilage constructs, the wavy-walled bioreactor demonstrated promise as an experimental cartilage tissue-engineering vessel.

40|$|Bioprocess {{information}} generated at the Process Scouting Devices (PSDs) -scale (< 100 mL) {{constitutes the}} initial building block upon which an industrial bioprocess is developed. Despite the key role that {{they play in}} bioprocess development, PSDs often lack the capability of monitoring the critical cell culture process parameters (e. g. dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, substrate consumption, product formation, etc.), and measuring certain engineering physical characteristics (e. g.,, mixing time). As a result there is a process information gap between un-instrumented PSDs and fully instrumented lab cell culture devices that makes the process transfer from research to manufacturing scale more of an art than a science. In this project we have equipped T-flasks, small-scale <b>spinner</b> <b>flasks</b> and novel PSDs such as SuperSpinner D 1000 ® with low cost disposable dissolved oxygen and pH sensors which can convert these un-instrumented PSDs to cell culture devices that can provide greater quantitative process information. By taking this approach, {{we have been able}} to 1) 	Convert T-flasks into novel upstream bioprocessing tools for scale-up/down applications such as cell clone stability testing. We observed from DO and pH profiles that after cell vial thaw significant biochemical pathway changes can occur during extended cell passaging in static T-flasks. Our on-line monitoring of pH and DO profiles picked the metabolic shifts ten passages earlier that the off-line sampling methods. 2) 	Develop empirical mass transfer correlations for rocking and shaken T-flasks and compare the oxygen transfer capabilities of these sensor enabled T-flasks with other PSDs such as <b>spinner</b> <b>flasks.</b> We observed that rocking/shaken T-flasks have superior mass transfer coefficient (kLa) than novel and traditional PSDs such as CultiFlask 50, SuperSpinner D 1000 ® and standard <b>spinner</b> <b>flasks.</b> 3) 	Provide a novel vial thaw and inoculum expansion train (rocking) with on-line monitoring capabilities for critical cell culture parameters such as DO and pH. We have observed that a design space based on kLa or DO can be developed at the PSDs-scale and integrated with bench-scale devices (and beyond). As a first step, this project shows how patch-based disposable optical technology can aid integrating research and manufacturing scales by using chemical engineering principles (mass transfer). We hypothesize that a robust and predictable bioprocess can be obtained by providing the cells with similar DO levels (or mass transfer coefficients) at every step of the bioprocess development cycle and thereby enabling implementation of Process Analytical Technology (PAT) ...|$|R

40|$|The most {{efficient}} and widely used system for generating helper-dependent adenoviral vectors (HDAds) is the Cre/loxP system developed by Graham and co-workers (Parks, R. J., Chen, L., Anton, M., Sankar, U., Rudnicki, M. A., and Graham, F. L. [1996]. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 13565 – 13570). Alternative {{systems have been}} developed for HDAd production, but all are limited by the technical complexity of a three-component vector production system for reproducibly generating large quantities of adenovirus with high infectivity and low helper virus (HV) contamination. Recently, these problems were addressed by Ng and co-workers (Palmer, D., and Ng, P. [2003]. Mol Ther. 8, 846 – 852), who developed an improved system that combines the use of a suspension-adapted producer cell line expressing high levels of Cre recombinase, a HV resistant to mutation, and a refined purification protocol. With this system, > 1 [*]×[*] 1013 highly infectious vector particles are easily produced without vector genome rearrangements and having very low HV contamination levels. However, the Ng system incorporates a <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> culture system that involves considerable time, effort, and tissue culture medium to produce HDAds. We have an alternative system to obtain comparable quantities with equivalent quality to the <b>spinner</b> <b>flask</b> approach but requiring reduced labor and lower volumes of medium. This method utilizes a 10 -chamber cell factory with adherent cells to produce high infectivity of HDAds with minimal HV contamination while improving yield and reducing technical complexity, effort, and medium requirements.

The bioreactor, within which engineered bone tissue is cultured, {{plays a key role in}} the development of engineered bone graphs. In this work, the potentials of the rotating wall vessel bioreactor (RWVB) and the human bio-derived bone scaffolds (BDBS) for 3 D bone culture are evaluated. The osteoblasts isolated from the cranium of neonatal Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat of 3 days old were expanded firstly with microcarrier suspension culture in a RWVB. After the assessment of the biological functions of the expanded cells by histomorphometry, the cells were seeded at 2 x 10 (6) and 1 x 10 (6) cells/mL, respectively, onto the 3 D human BDBS and cultured for 3 weeks in the RWVB. The cells metabolism and nutrient concentration were monitored in the whole culture processes. The structure of the harvested bone tissues was observed with optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The biological properties of the engineered bone were detected by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression and alizarin red staining to visualize the newly formed bone. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) double fluorescence staining was used to analyze the cell activity. For a comparative study, cell seeded constructs were also cultured in static conditions. The results indicate that the bone grafts cultured in RWVB with two different seeded cell densities grew well, and the cell number expanded in RWVB was five times as that in T-flask and <b>spinner</b> <b>flask.</b> There were significantly more collagen fibers mineralized nodules and new osteoid tissue formed than those in T-flask and <b>spinner</b> <b>flask.</b> It also demonstrated that with the stress stimulation inside the fluid in the RWVB, the ALP expression could be increased; the formation of mineralized nodules can be accelerated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Glucose and lactate {{metabolic}} {{rates were}} evaluated for cultures of cord blood (CB) mononuclear cell (MNC), peripheral blood (PB) MNC, and PB CD 34 + cell cultures {{carried out in}} <b>spinner</b> <b>flasks</b> and in T-flasks in both serum-containing and serum-free media. Specific glucose uptake rates (qgluc, in micromoles per cell per hour) and lactate generation rates (qlac) correlated with the percentage of colony-forming cells (CFC) present in the culture for {{a broad range of}} culture conditions. Spe-cifically, the time of maximum CFC percentage in each culture coincided with the time of maximum qgluc and qlac in cultures with different seeding densities and cyto-kine combinations. A two-population model (Qlac = a[CFC] + b([TC] − [CFC]), where [TC] is total cell concen-tration; Qlac is volumetric lactate production rate in mi-cromoles per milliliter per hour; a is qlac for an average CFC; and b is qlac for an average non-CFC) was devel-oped to describe lactate production. The model de-scribed lactate production well for cultures carried out in both T-flasks and <b>spinner</b> <b>flasks</b> and inoculated with ei-ther PB or CB MNC or PB CD 34 + cells. The values for a and b that were derived from the model varied with both the inoculum density and the cytokine combination. However, preliminary results indicate that cultures car-ried out under the same conditions from different samples with similar initial CD 34 + cell content have simi-lar values for a and b. These findings suggest that {{it should be possible to}} use lactate production data to pre-dict the harvest time that corresponds to the maximum number of CFC in culture. The ability to harvest ex vivo hematopoietic cultures for transplantation when CFC are at a maximum has the potential to speed the rate at which immunocompromised patients recover. © 199...|$|R
