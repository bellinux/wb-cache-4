This thesis examines the emergence of Olympic sport aid policy in the early phase of its establishment in 1961 with {{the founding of the}} Commission For International Olympic Aid (CIOA) and the Olympic Solidarity (OS) in the early 1970 s. The study aims to explore the global process of cultural flows of Olympism and modern sport, and the international relations involved in constructing, modifying or resisting the Olympic 'message'. A tentative conceptualisation of 'aid donors' (core and semi-periphery) and the 'aid recipients' (peripheral states) is outlined in relation to the global sport interaction between nation states. At the macro level, {{it is clear that the}} bi-political order of the Cold War, the decolonisation process, and the development aid projects provided to the newly independent countries in Africa and Asia influenced agents' approaches in forming the sport aid policy and the promotion of Olympic institutions. At the meso level, the IOC relations with UNESCO, IFs, regional games and National Olympic Committees and the emergence of hyper nationalism, commercialism and professionalism impinge on the creation of the global <b>sport</b> <b>aid</b> <b>programme</b> that emphasises the hegemony of the Olympic movement. The research subscribes to critical realism as its ontological and epistemological base and the principal method employed to investigate is a form of qualitative content analysis using a protocol drawn from ethnographic content analysis. Inductive and deductive techniques were utilised to analyse 355 official documents and agents' correspondence in English, French and German gathered from Olympic Museum archives and facilitated by the application of QSR NUD*IST software for qualitative data analysis. A socio-economic and political account of the postcolonial era is provided as viewed through 'prism' of modernisation, cultural imperialism, dependency and figuration theories. The thesis provides an approach to the evaluation of the global diffusion of sport and Olympism through the aid programmes revealing complex responses and engagement with global processes, contextualised by (in some ways) homogenous and (in others) heterogeneous nature of the global sport...|$|E

The main research question is: How can the Norwegian Confederation of Sports’ involvement in SDP from the early 1980 s to 2000 be understood? Through two different cases, Tanzania and Zimbabwe respectively, I show how NIF has argued for its SDP engagement, through analysing the formal discourses of the projects.

However, its {{multilateral}} <b>aid</b> <b>programme,</b> while well-placed to set a new standard in development assistance, suffers from problems of democratic accountability confronting all transnational actors in an increasingly global community. Examination of the rules governing the European Commission's <b>aid</b> <b>programme</b> to Asian and Latin American countries reveals a pattern of perverse incentives facing private consultants and a lack of access to information that makes the programme virtually unaccountable to both European taxpayers and citizens in recipient countries. Case material from the Philippines illustrates the problems in the Commission's <b>aid</b> <b>programme.</b> Proposals for reform are presented that are both politically feasible and capable of making the programme significantly more transparent and accountable. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{examination}} of recent changes in the organisation and activity of Canada's foreign <b>aid</b> <b>programme.</b> Three conceptually distinct categories form the theoretical framework of the study: (a) contending approaches {{to the study of}} international relations; (b) contending conceptions of economic growth and development; and (c) contending approaches to the aid policy-making process. The study examines the multiple objectives underlying Canada's <b>aid</b> <b>programme,</b> develops and interprets a series of "aid quality" indices, and undertakes a detailed examination of the aid policy process. Emphasis is placed on tracing the specific combination of domestic "push" and international "pull" factors which have pressured Ottawa into initiatives promoting a closer linkage of the aid and trade facets of government activity. Attention is also drawn to the impact of these initiatives on the developmental objectives of the programme. The principal finding of the study is that while Canada's <b>aid</b> <b>programme</b> has until recently been able to maintain a precarious balance between the opposing forces of philanthropy and self-interest, there are now unmistakable signs of a deliberate effort to tilt the programme in a more commercial direction. In this trend, the single case of Canada mirrors a more general pattern towards an increasingly commercial orientation in most donor <b>aid</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R

These authors also caution that <b>aid</b> <b>programmes</b> can reinforce the structures that support war. I think that this danger can extend to landmine programmes as well. This possibility, and its prevention, will be further explored. The final part of this section will explore of the dynamics of peacebuilding and how it can be incorporated into landmine work...|$|R
