5000|$|Hot bulb engines were {{produced}} {{until the late}} 1920s, often being called [...] "semi-diesels", {{even though they were}} not as efficient as compression ignition engines. They had the advantage of comparative simplicity, since they did not require the air compressor used by early Diesel engines; fuel was injected mechanically (<b>solid</b> <b>injection)</b> near the start of the compression stroke, at a much lower pressure than that of Diesel engines.|$|E
50|$|Diesel {{engines in}} service today raise the fuel to extreme {{pressures}} by mechanical pumps and deliver {{it to the}} combustion chamber by pressure-activated injectors without compressed air. With direct injected diesels, injectors spray fuel through 4 to 12 small orifices in its nozzle. The early air injection diesels always had a superior combustion without the sharp increase in pressure during combustion. Research is now being performed and patents are being taken out to again use some form of air injection to reduce the nitrogen oxides and pollution, reverting to Diesel's original implementation with its superior combustion and possibly quieter operation. In all major aspects, the modern diesel engine holds true to Rudolf Diesel's original design, that of igniting fuel by compression at an extremely high pressure within the cylinder. With much higher pressures and high technology injectors, present-day diesel engines use the so-called <b>solid</b> <b>injection</b> system applied by Herbert Akroyd Stuart for his hot bulb engine. The indirect injection engine {{could be considered the}} latest development of these low speed hot bulb ignition engines.|$|E

In this mechanism, weights on the end of long cables are deployed away from the body of the spinning satellite. When the cables are cut, much or all of the angular momentum of the spin is transferred to the discarded weights.

40|$|The term biosolids {{refers to}} the nutrient-rich organic {{materials}} resulting from the treatment of domestic sewage at a wastewater treatment facility. It is a widely acceptable term for sewage sludge that has been treated at a wastewater treatment plant and is beneficially recycled. Biosolids inherently come from sewage sludge, so {{they have the same}} origin and biological nature, but a different applicability. The quantity of municipal biosolids produced increases annually in the United States. The production of biosolids has increased because of both the advance of sanitation and wastewater treatment and the growth of population. Sludge or biosolids are contaminated by varying amounts of heavy metals or hazardous organic compounds from industrial and commercial wastewater. Therefore, society has to face the potential for increased negative impacts on the environment from the increasing volume of biosolids being produced. Public concerns about applied biosolids treatment or reuse methods are potential health, environmental, or aesthetic impacts (such things as disease, odors), because of the pollutants in the biosolids. The most commonly used methods for biosolids treatment and recycling are briefly reviewed in the first two chapters of this thesis. However, the current biosolids treatment or recycling options have their own defects. A new and innovative technology, deep biosolids injection, is proposed for the treatment of biosolids and is to be implemented by Los Angeles where the City has been granted underground <b>solids</b> <b>injection</b> control permits under Class V wells by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Deep biosolids injection is a process referred to as one type of several deep underground injection techniques. It shares many similarities with slurried <b>solids</b> <b>injection</b> above the fracture pressure, which has been successfully used for the treatment of slurried non-hazardous solid materials produced in the oil industry such as drill cuttings, viscous emulsions with clay, oily sand, NORMs (naturally occurring radioactive materials), pipe scale, tank bottoms, soil from spill clean-up, and so on. The distinctive biosolids properties result in injection mechanisms different from other slurry injection processes. Filtration and consolidation processes occur simultaneously along with injection of biosolids, and these must be understood in order to properly design and manage a biosolids injection operation. Hydraulic fracture mechanisms, filtration theory and consolidation principles provide the basis for the interpretation of biosolids injection process. A semi-analytical hydraulic fracture model for injection of a compressible substance (biosolids) is developed as a modification of the Perkins-Kern-Nordgren (PKN) hydraulic fracture model. The PKN model is modified with a pseudo-dynamic leak-off function that describes the deposition of biosolids (filtration) and plugging effect of biosolids on the fracture wall in a porous medium. The pseudo-dynamic leak-off function is given in terms of the net pressure and the resistance of the filter cake to flow. The hydraulic fracture model is employed to compute the volume of biosolids slurry remaining in an open induced fracture. The consolidation process in the closure phase of deep biosolids injection is described using the biosolids properties under different stress conditions. A Terzaghi-type relationship is used to compute the volume change in the closure phase using compressibility data available from published literature. In contrast to the conventional PKN leak-off model, simulation results using the new model show that the induced fracture volume is much larger because of the impaired leak-off and because of the volumetric effects and consolidation of the biosolids in the fracture. Solids contents and biosolids compaction behavior have significant impacts on the geometry of fracture (width, length, volume) over time. The model was developed to help guide large-scale injection of municipal and animal biosolids as an environmentally more secure method of treatment than surface approaches...|$|R

40|$|Abandoned mine {{drainage}} (AMD) solids {{were evaluated}} {{for their ability}} to capture mercury from the flue gas of coal fired power plants. A fixed bed system was used to test Hg adsorption and oxidation by this material in a typical simulated flue gas. Fixed-bed tests showed that abandoned mine drainage from three mines displayed considerable capability for absorbing and oxidizing Hg 0. Among all the flue gas components, HCl showed the greatest impact on Hg capture in the fixed-bed test, while O 2 was shown to be not as important. A decrease in mercury capture and oxidation was observed when SO 2 and NO 2 were added to the flue gas. The addition of SO 2 and NO prohibited mercury uptake but showed no impact on Hg oxidation. An entrained flow system was utilized to test mercury removal efficiency when abandoned mine drainage solids were injected into the flue gas. Four different AMD solids were tested using both eastern coal and PRB coal flue gas. Results showed that one AMD sample achieved about 80 % Hg removal at the <b>solids</b> <b>injection</b> rate of 0. 39 g/m 3 injection rate. Mercury removal efficiency with other AMD samples under the identical conditions ranged from 25 %~ 50 %. Thus, this material shows great potential as a novel sorbent on Hg emission control technology. Moreover, Hg removal efficiency was found to be positively related to the iron content of AMD solids. Therefore, AMD solids with high iron content would be more desirable as mercury removal sorbent. The foam index test was also performed using this material to study the possible effect of AMD solids on the application of fly ash in concrete making, which is the main disadvantage of activated carbon injection technology. The test results indicated that all AMD samples used in this study would not have any adverse effect on the fly ash with regards to its application for concrete making...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this report is to present the results of tests {{performed}} by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics {{to determine the effect}} on engine performance of directing the flow of the inlet air to a 5 -inch by 7 -inch cylinder, <b>solid</b> <b>injection,</b> compression ignition engine, After a few preliminary tests, comparative runs were made at a speed of 1500 r. p. m. with and without directed air flow.

The results indicate the possibility of improving the performance of a given type of combustion chamber without changing its shape and with no change in valve timing.

40|$|Due to {{the rising}} demand of {{light-weight}} constructions {{as well as the}} conservation of resources, the density and weight of thermoplastic parts could be influenced significantly by using the thermoplastic foam injection molding process. The structure of the foam injection molded part, which typically means solid surface layers and a cellular core, usually results in a weight saving. Furthermore the materials structure leads to an increasing of the specific bending stiffness with a simultaneous low tendency to warp.

However, given the low densities (~ 5 larvae per ft. 2) and patchiness of the natural grub populations, only single- and double-passes of hollow-tine equipment were able to reduce populations when compared to untreated controls.

The recommendations and assessments of the resulting plasma and tokamak operations impacts of a massive-gasinjection disruption mitigation system have been developed in concert with the ITER Fusion Science and Technology Department. Several recommendations are made for the system: high reliability, large flexibility in the choice, mixture and quantity of gases, and its installation in at least two toroidal locations to provide redundancy. The large quantity of deuterium or helium neutral gas, ~ 500 kPa-m 3 estimated to provide unequivocal collisional mitigation of runaway electron conversion is found to have significant after-injection impacts on the ITER torus vacuum pumping and exhaust processing systems.

In particular, the development of fine ceramic powders with unusual and superior properties will be of great interest. Thermal plasmas with their unique processing capabilities will {{play an important role in}} these developments. High temperature gas-phase chemistry within thermal plasma environments provides an attractive and chemically unspecific route for powder synthesis. Furthermore, the supersaturation of vapor species which provides the driving force for particle condensation can be very large, leading to the production of ultrafine particles by homogeneous nucleation. Ceramic powders such as carbides, nitrides, oxides and solid solutions have been successfully synthesized in thermal plasma reactors based on high intensity arcs, plasma jets and rf inductively coupled discharges. Starting materials are either in the form of gases, liquids or solids. However, the availability of gas phase precursors for metals is severely limited. Therefore, the most commonly used reactants for plasma synthesis are solids.

However, most of two-interconnected {{fluidized bed}}s systems require riser and/or pneumatic transport line for solid conveying and loopseals or seal-pots for gas sealing, recirculation of solids to the riser, and maintaining of pressure balance. The riser (transport bed) is operated at the high velocity fluidization condition and residence times of gas and solid in the riser are very short. If the reaction rate of catalyst or sorbent is slow, the riser can not ensure sufficient contact time between gas and solid {{and we have to}} use two bubbling beds for each reaction to ensure sufficient contact time. In this case, additional riser must be installed for solid circulation. Consequently, conventional two-interconnected fluidized bed systems are very complex, large, and difficult to operate. To solve these problems, a novel two-interconnected fluidized bed system has been developed. This system has two bubbling beds, <b>solid</b> <b>injection</b> nozzles, solid conveying lines, and downcomers.
