5|$|After {{watching}} an advertisement on television for Duff Gardens, Homer, Bart and Lisa decide to go. As they prepare to leave, Marge tells them that spinster Great Aunt Gladys died {{and they will}} be going to her funeral instead.

Angry because of Cartman's outrageous sexual lies about Wendy in his book, Stan tries to convince Cartman to stop selling the books to no avail. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey again confront Cartman, and force him to stop selling his books on school grounds. This upsets Cartman, who accuses them of turning the school into a [...] "socialist horrorland", and insists he is leaving the school. The next day, however, he appears on his show and spins a portrayal of himself in blue face-paint and suspenders, having somehow found Smurfland, becoming part of Smurf culture and eventually {{falling in love with}} Smurfette. Cartman then claims that Wendy bulldozed Smurfland and slaughtered the Smurfs to get their valuable Smurfberries, the complete story of which he has chronicled in his DVD, [...] "Dances with Smurfs".

500|$|The {{pictures}} were taken almost entirely in Super 8 format, {{and most of}} the photo shoots took place in New York City and Miami. Locations in New York City included the Hotel Chelsea and Times Square's all-male burlesque Gaiety Theatre (dancers from theatre participated in one of the book's photo sessions), whereas in Miami the majority of the sessions were shot at a house Madonna had purchased just before starting the project, and in several beaches and streets. One morning during the four-day Florida shoot Madonna was prancing around her 14-bedroom house in Miami completely naked, when someone jokingly suggested <b>she</b> <b>go</b> out on the street, then, according to Baron [...] "the next thing we're in the street" [...] where allegedly [...] "cars screeched to a halt, motorists whistled, and one entranced cyclist fell off his bike." [...] This {{was just one of the}} many crazy episodes that took place during the shooting of the book. According to Baron, during the photo shoots [...] "'d do something crazy and then we'd come up with something even crazier". One of the most shocking photographs made for the book, which featured two women in post-punk attire flanking Madonna with one of them holding a knife to Madonna's crotch, was dismissed as it was considered too violent. At some point, while the book was being produced, some of the photographs were stolen, but were quickly recovered by the FBI. According to New York magazine, there were approximately 80,000photographs taken for the book, but only a handful made the final cut. The printing of the book was extended for 15days making the total production process last about eight months.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 17, O'Hara {{was offered}} her first major role at the Abbey Theatre, but was distracted by the attentions of actor-singer Harry Richman. Richman {{arranged}} with {{the manager of the}} Gresham Hotel in Dublin to meet her at the hotel while she was dining with her family. He proposed that <b>she</b> <b>go</b> to Elstree Studios for a screen test and become a film actress. O'Hara arrived in London shortly afterwards with her mother. During the screen test, the studio adorned her in a [...] "gold lamé dress with flapping sleeves like wings" [...] and heavy makeup with an ornate hair style, which was deemed to be far from satisfactory. O'Hara detested the audition, during which she had to walk in and pick up a telephone. She recalled thinking to herself, [...] "My God, get me back to the Abbey". Charles Laughton later saw the test and, despite the overdone makeup and costume, was intrigued, paying particular notice to her large and expressive eyes. After seeking the approval of his business partner Erich Pommer, they arranged to meet O'Hara through a talent agency run by Connie Chapman and Vere Barker. Laughton was impressed with O'Hara, particularly by her lack of nerves and refusal to read an extract upon his request unprepared, during which she said: [...] "I am very sorry but absolutely no". She was offered an initial seven-year contract with their new company, Mayflower Pictures. Though her family were shocked at her being given a contract so young, they accepted, and O'Hara traveled across Ireland in celebration before arriving back in London to commence her film career.

He enabled Saint-Cyr to set up her millinery salon within his London fashion house. The Australian Women's Weekly described Saint-Cyr's association with the royal family and Hartnell in 1960: [...] "She drives to the Palace or Clarence House in Norman Hartnell's Rolls-Royce and etiquette demands that <b>she</b> <b>go</b> hatless".

During her second year, she and Bwa Bwa helped to secretly organize a support group for other Karen students, collecting money to give a prize to a student in one of the refugee camps. In her third year, Zoya entered a three-month internship in the consumer department of Telecoms Asia, and was offered a position after she completed her degree. After three years, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in business administration. [...] Upon returning to the refugee camps, she and several other Karen students from their organization illegally crossed the Burmese border to Papun so they could personally deliver their prize to the winner and to document what was happening to Karen people still in Burma. Soon after they returned, Zoya considered accepting Telecoms Asia's offer, but ultimately accepted a scholarship to study in the United Kingdom with her sister, while her younger brother Slone went to study in Canada. Before she left, her father took in two Burmese child soldiers who were sent to kill both him and Zoya; although they failed, {{it was the first time}} the Burmese government had specifically targeted her. Her mother died a few weeks later, and Zoya considered staying to help her father; however, he insisted that <b>she</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E
