The <b>synthetic</b> <b>pyrethroid</b> insecticide Phenothrin {{in combination with}} the hormone analogue methoprene was a popular topical flea and tick therapy for felines.

25|$|These can {{contribute}} to control of blowflies and tsetse-flies for example. The blowfly traps contain a liquid that smells like the rotting flesh of a carcass {{and the structure of}} the trap is designed to prevent the flies from escaping once attracted in. Horse-flies can be controlled by traps that attract the flies to a suspended black ball that mimics a potential host; flies attracted become trapped in a cone above. For area wide control of tsetse-flies targets (these do not trap the flies) that combine a rectangle of dark blue or black cloth and often an attractant chemical act as simple mimics of the fly's host. When the flies land on the cloth they contact the <b>synthetic</b> <b>pyrethroid</b> that is impregnated into the cloth.|$|E
25|$|These usually {{consist of}} netting made of {{synthetic}} fibers or fine metal mesh that is fitted to the ventilation slats / windows of housing for livestock animals. The fiber netting can be impregnated with insecticides {{such as the}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>pyrethroid</b> deltamethrin that acts rapidly when flies such as Stomoxys or Glossina species land on it. Valuable horses in areas infested with Culicoides midges or Simulium black-flies can be protected with commercially available shields made of cloth that fit over head, neck and back. Flies such as the Musca, Stomoxys and Haematobia species have larval habitats amongst livestock dung and soiled bedding found around livestock farms. There is scope for reducing fly infestation by clearing these wastes to composting containers or areas. However, for many types of dipteran fly the larvae inhabit areas such as bogs (Culicoides), swamps (mosquitoes), or rivers (Simulium) that are impractical to treat under typical commercial constraints within agriculture.|$|E
50|$|Some {{differences}} in the chemistry between pyrethrins and <b>synthetic</b> <b>pyrethroids</b> have the result that <b>synthetic</b> <b>pyrethroids</b> have relatively longer environmental persistence than do pyrethrins. Pyrethrins have shorter environmental persistence than <b>synthetic</b> <b>pyrethroids</b> because their chemical structure is more susceptible {{to the presence of}} UV light and changes in pH.|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Synthetic</b> <b>pyrethroids</b> are {{pesticides}} {{derived from}} naturally occurring pyrethrins, taken from pyrethrum of dried Chrysanthemum flowers. They are chemically {{designed to be}} more toxic with lower break down times and are formulated with synergists increasing potency and compromising the body’s ability to detoxify the pesticide. Though claimed to be selectively toxic to insects, <b>synthetic</b> <b>pyrethroids</b> are extremely toxic to aquatic organisms, including fish in concentrations {{similar to those used}} for controlling mosquito, black fly and tsetse fly larvae, which are the actual targets of pyrethroids. Many pyrethroids have been linked to the disruption of the endocrine system, reproduction and sexual development, interference with the immune system and the induction of breast cancer. The widespread use of pyrethroids is a major problem as they pollute the agricultural lands and water resources and affect non-target organisms and humans. Recent studies show that some microbes are able to degrade <b>synthetic</b> <b>pyrethroids</b> by esterase production and this application is proposed as an inexpensive and simple method. In the present work, the aspects related to the toxicity and biodegradation of <b>synthetic</b> <b>pyrethroids</b> are discussed...|$|R
