The doors of the school {{actually}} opened on 2 February 1939 under the banner of Saint Michael's School. Under the leadership of Mother Engelbert, the Sisters of the institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary came to establish this first convent school in Gaya. The school was originally Hindi medium, though it slowly evolved into two sections - Hindi and English - and ultimately it became English medium with Hindi as a subject.By 1953 ground was broken for school building with five new classrooms. In 1955, the former Mazumdar property next door was purchased. 1964 saw the third storey put on the building of 1953 plus a further wing of nine more classrooms The School hall and library room were additions of' 1969, followed in 1974-76 by the high school building of twelve more class rooms. The Administration block was built in 1990 and Primary <b>Section</b> <b>block</b> was built in 1993.The newest construction in the campus situated in front of the auditorium consists of two state-of-the-art computer labs, mathematics and language labs was inaugurated on 22 October 2009.The first location of the school was in a house on Katari Hill Road.

In 1887, it was recognized as a middle school; it was recognized as ‘European High School’ affiliated to Cambridge University.

It was handed over to the Irish Christian brothers of Nainital in 1908 & they looked after till 1916 when Bishop Gamigna took it over. With a boarding of 26 students, the total went up to 63 in 1920.

Illumination of miniSOG generates sufficient singlet oxygen to locally catalyze the polymerization of diaminobenzidine into an osmiophilic reaction product resolvable by EM. MiniSOG fusions to many well-characterized proteins localize correctly in mammalian cells, intact nematodes, and rodents, enabling correlated fluorescence and EM from large volumes of tissue after strong aldehyde fixation, without the need for exogenous ligands, probes, or destructive permeabilizing detergents. MiniSOG permits high quality ultrastructural preservation and 3 -dimensional protein localization via electron tomography or serial <b>section</b> <b>block</b> face scanning electron microscopy. EM shows that miniSOG-tagged SynCAM 1 is presynaptic in cultured cortical neurons, whereas miniSOG-tagged SynCAM 2 is postsynaptic in culture and in intact mice. Thus SynCAM 1 and SynCAM 2 could be heterophilic partners. MiniSOG may do for EM what Green Fluorescent Protein did for fluorescence microscopy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a {{fuzzy logic}} control (FLC) is Proposed {{to control the}} maximum power point {{tracking}} (MPPT) for a photovoltaic (PV) system and to control the maximum power point for a wind turbine (WT) system. Hybrid integrated topology, fed by photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT) sources and suitable for distributed generation applications, is proposed. It works as an uninterruptible power source that is able to feed a certain minimum amount of power into the grid under all conditions. PV is used as the primary source of power operating near maximum power point (MPP), with the WT <b>section</b> (<b>block),</b> acting as a current source, feeding only the deficit power. The unique “integrated ” approach obviates the need for dedicated communication between the two sources for coordination and eliminates the use of a separate, conventional dc/dc boost converter stage required for PV power processing. The conventional boost converter decreases the efficiency because of hard switching, which generates losses when the switches are turned on/off. During this interval, all switches in the adopted circuit perform zero-current switching by the resonant inductor at turn-on, and zero-voltage switching by the resonant capacitor at turn-off. This switching pattern can reduce the switching losses, voltage and current stress of the switching device. The Hybrid systems have been simulated in MATLAB Simulink software and their Control Schemes have been analyzed and validated...|$|E

An original frequency model, strictly {{equivalent to a}} time linear convolution, is used for speech signals under highly reverberant conditions. If the responses are virtually <b>sectioned</b> in K <b>blocks</b> of N samples, the time linear convolutions are strictly transformed in fre-quency domain at frequency ν, into FIR filtering of K taps where the K taps are the complex gains of the K <b>sectioned</b> <b>blocks</b> at the same frequency ν. Short values of the DFT, N, can be employed, although {{the length of the}} responses re-mains long enough (K. N samples) to suit with acoustic re-sponses. Finally, the separation is achieved with a natural gradient algorithm based on a maximum-entropy cost func-tion. The proposed method is then tested on speech signals. 1...|$|R
