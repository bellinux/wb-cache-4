25|$|Discounting {{began in}} the 1970s and was {{dramatically}} expanded in the 1990s, according to one report. Discrepancy between sticker and average net prices can vary substantially. Estimates vary, but show a consistent pattern of sticker prices being much greater than real costs, sometimes more than double, sometimes only {{one and a half}} times as high. Estimates are that 88% or 67% get some form of discount. One estimate in 2015 was that at private nonprofit four-year colleges, the average first-year student pays 48% less than the <b>sticker</b> <b>price.</b> Generally, the sticker-to-net price discrepancy is greater at private colleges than public universities. For example, in 2011–2012, the average <b>sticker</b> <b>price</b> for tuition, fees and living expenses at private colleges, was $38,590 while the average actual cost was $23,060; at public colleges, the average <b>sticker</b> <b>price</b> was $17,130 and the average actual cost was $11,380. Another estimate was that the average full-time undergraduate gets $6,500 in grant aid along with $1,000 in tax-based aid to offset tuition and fees. There is widespread consensus that the most cost-effective college option is community colleges, which charge on average only $3,000 for full-time tuition.|$|E

Due to what many American consumers have perceived as a declining quality among the automobiles manufactured by the [...] "Big Three" [...] and large fixed labor and capital costs, discounts tend to be larger on domestic vehicles. In 2003 the average discount on a domestic vehicle was 20.6% below MSRP. For Japanese and Korean vehicles the average discount was 10% and 12.8%.

40|$|Ontario’s University {{system has}} an {{institutional}} structure that {{differs from that}} in some other jurisdictions, especially the United States, and from a competitive framework implicit in economic models of higher education. In particular, the Province is the seller of an accredited University education, and it has an elaborate pricing and allocation mechanism including regulated tuition fees, provincial operating grants and a student loan program. Importantly, unlike a competitive market, observed enrolment rates are not a simple function of price (tuition). Possible implications of this structure are briefly explored and some simple theoretical implications are discussed. In the empirical portion of the paper we use multiple regression analysis to estimate the impact of rising tuition fees, living and accommodation costs, public support, scholarships and bursaries, and cyclical changes in the economy upon application behaviour and enrolment rates for 16 provincially assisted universities in Ontario.

2500|$|Colleges use high sticker prices {{because it}} allows them wide {{latitude}} in how to use funds to attract the best students, as well as entice students with special skills or increase its overall racial or ethnic diversity. The most sought-after students can be enticed by high discounts while marginal students can be charged full freight. Further, the high <b>sticker</b> <b>price</b> is a marketing tool to suggest the overall worth of a college education, {{along the lines of}} encouraging people to think that [...] "schools that cost more must provide a better education." [...] A report by the Pew Research Center found that while there was growing concern about escalating college prices, most Americans believed that their personal investment in higher education was sound. But discounting adds complexity to decision-making, deterring some students from applying in some instances based on a false sense of unaffordability. In recent years, there has been attention to the problem of bright students from low-income backgrounds not applying to top colleges, and attending less challenging colleges instead or skipping college entirely; this phenomenon has been called undermatching in the sense that these students are not properly paired or [...] "matched" [...] with academically challenging colleges; there have been efforts at some colleges such as Williams to actively seek out bright low-income students. According to NBC reporter Nona Willis-Aronowitz, the financial makeup of the student body at elite colleges tends to be mostly affluent students, with some low-income students if the college actively seeks out bright low-income applicants, but few students from middle-class backgrounds. As a result, middle-class applicants are increasingly faced with a tough choice: to either attend an elite school, paying close to the <b>sticker</b> <b>price,</b> and graduate with substantial debt, or to attend a publicly supported state school with less debt; Aronowitz described this as the [...] "middle class squeeze".

We also find an increase in the share of the student body from the top income quintile receiving financial aid (from about 14. 5 % to 18 % of the student body). The share of all students, aided and non-aided, from the top 20 % of the income distribution has remained approximately constant during this period, suggesting that the increase in the share of aided students in this quintile has come from formerly unaided high income students. ...|$|R
2500|$|Due to {{the success}} of the 1969 Grand Prix, other GM {{divisions}} followed suit and introduced similar cars for 1970. The Chevrolet Monte Carlo used the same basic G-body as the GP but with a two-inch shorter wheelbase (116 vs. the GP's 118) and a long hood, though still shorter than the Grand Prix's, but still considered an upscale vehicle for GM's lowest-priced division. Oldsmobile, whose larger and more expensive front-drive Toronado was a direct competitor to the Thunderbird, decided to further capitalize on strong sales of its intermediate Cutlass line by introducing a new Cutlass Supreme coupe with a formal roofline similar to the GPs but on the standard [...] wheelbase used for two-door A-body intermediates and the same lower sheetmetal used on other Cutlass models.
