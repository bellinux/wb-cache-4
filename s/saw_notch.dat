40|$|Residual {{stresses}} in {{rigid pavements}} diminish a pavement's ability to sustain its designed load. When capacity {{is reduced by}} residual stress, a pavement is vulnerable to premature failure necessitating costly repairs or replacement. A test method for measuring residual stresses has already been developed for steel wherein a small hole is drilled adjacent to an affixed surface strain gage (ASTM E 837 2008). Based on the geometry of the test procedure, the change in strain reading is correlated to a residual stress in the steel material. While rigid pavements are as detrimentally affected by the formation of residual stresses as steel, no similar testing method exists for concrete. Recent research conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA???s) National Airport Pavement Test Facility (NAPTF) investigated the strain relaxation of cantilevered concrete beams when a blind-depth hole using core drilling {{is made in the}} vicinity of an affixed strain gage. Initial findings indicated that the testing procedure partially quantified the residual stresses. Research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) improved the testing procedure using cantilevered concrete beams by instead <b>sawing</b> a linear <b>notch</b> near one end of the strain gage and <b>sawing</b> two linear <b>notches</b> near both ends of the strain gage. Results for the doubly notched concrete beam proved to be a much improved method for measuring residual stresses when compared to the core-drilled test procedure. The current project further improved test procedures and completed additional lab and field testing on in-situ plain concrete pavements. The test procedure was altered in order to observe the strain relaxation in three directions while four saw cuts are made surrounding the strain rosette. When this area of concrete had been appropriately isolated from load-induced stresses, simple calculations determine the residual stress of the material. Three dimensional Finite Element Model (FEM) analyses of these tests further corroborates the findings suggesting that the residual stresses in plain concrete pavements can be reliably measured...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of {{residual}} stresses {{is important in}} understanding and predicting a concrete pavement???s performance. However, {{there is not a}} standard test for residual stresses in pavements. Prior pavement research was inspired by the hole-drilling straingage method used in metals. This method involves drilling a small hole into the specimen and measuring the resulting stress relaxation near the hole with strain gages. The strain change is then used to calculate the residual stresses in the metal. The pavement research at the Federal Aviation Administration???s National Airport Pavement Test Facility showed the promise of using core rings to create a similar stress relaxation in cantilevered concrete beams. The cantilevered beams were used to create a known and moderately-uniform stress state in the specimens. Testing at the University of Illinois continued the use of core rings and cantilevered beams and also introduced a method using notches. Strain gages on each beam measured the strain relaxation due to a core ring, one notch, or many notches. Strain relaxation was clearly seen in the core ring and notch beam tests, and this relaxation was most pronounced with the <b>notch</b> tests. <b>Sawing</b> a <b>notch</b> on both sides of a strain gage was able to relax all of the strain induced by the cantilever loading, making the residual stress calculation quite simple.

In the games in which the Twins scored at least three runs, Chance posted a 13-4 record. Despite his strong season, owner Calvin Griffith, well known for being [...] "thrifty", tried to cut Chance's salary by $9,000.

40|$|Abstract: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the ability of phased-array ultrasonic techniques to detect and accurately determine the size of flaws from the far-side of wrought austenitic piping welds. The work was sponsored by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission under Contract DE-AC 06 - 76 RLO 1830; NRC JCN Y 6604; Ms. Deborah Jackson, Program Monitor. Far-side inspections of these welds are currently performed on a “best effort ” basis and do not conform to ASME Code Section XI Appendix VIII performance demonstration requirements. For this study, four circumferential welds in 610 mm diameter, 36 mm thick ASTM A- 358, Grade 304 vintage austenitic stainless steel pipe were examined. The welds were fabricated with varied welding parameters; both horizontal and vertical pipe orientations were used, with air and water backing, to simulate field welding conditions. A series of saw cuts, electro-discharge machined (EDM) notches, and implanted fatigue cracks were placed into the heat affected zones of the welds. The <b>saw</b> cuts and <b>notches</b> range in depth from 7. 5 % to 28. 4 % through-wall. The implanted cracks ranged in depth from 5 % through wall to 64 % through wall.

40|$|International audienceThe {{excavation}} {{of the site}} of Cassagna 2 (Blagnac, Haute-Garonne), carried out by AFAN (French National Archaeological Association) from August to November 2001 (Tchérémissinoff et al., 2002), {{was due to the}} development of the « Aeroconstellation » ZAC (Commercial Business Area) on the outskirts of Toulouse. This excavation was surrounded by other occupation sites: to the east, by the Chalcolithic sites of Cassagna 1 (directed by Sébastien Lacombe) and to the west, by an Early Bronze Age site, Cassagna 3 (directed by Fabrice Pons). They had been preserved by the loamy cover of the land rising above the second bottom of the Garonne, approximately 3 km to the west of its present bed. The site was revealed thanks to the discovery of two sheets of artefacts trapped in vast palaeo-depressions. The sheet corresponding to Sector 1, preserved over 1400 m 2 (fig. 2), has been dated to the Late Bronze Age IIIb. To the north-west, the «Chalcolithic sheet» (sector 2), the object of this article, extends over approximately 340 m 2. The discovery of the three « Cassagna » sites, covering the entire sequence of the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, represents an extraordinary opportunity to gain clearer knowledge of these periods in the Toulouse region. The alluvial terraces of the Garonne do not provide the best fossilisation and prior information concerning this period was mainly provided by certain sites in the Aude region known as the Véraza group (Guilaine ed., 1980). Closer to home, some finds including closed units had revealed a clearer regional characterisation (Vaquer, 1990, p. 345). However, such new references to these «impersonal» facies from the boundary of the western extension of the Véraza group and its transition manifestations towards the Bronze Age were very welcome. In terms of the Bell Beaker phenomenon, the region had already provided a major excavation, the site of Lapeyrière, Muret (Jolibert, 1988), which revealed a fine series of ceramics composed of decorated elements which can be attributed to the Pyrenean facies (Guilaine, 1984) as well as numerous elements belonging to the Bell Beaker «common ware» type (Besse, 2003, p. 18). In this series, only 6 of the elements seem to belong to the regional Chalcolithic, which motivated its specifically Bell Beaker attribution. This is often the case in Western Languedoc where «exclusively» domestic occupations seemed to have predominated over «mixed» occupations (Guilaine et al., 2001, p. 254). The importance of the Chalcolithic basis for the formation of the Early Bronze Age is moreover frequently observed and this aspect undeniably constituted a supplementary difficulty in recognising Bell Beaker dwellings. Nevertheless, even on sites defined as «exclusively Bell Beaker», decorated ceramics are never in the majority: there is no reason therefore for them to be indispensable for this definition. And if the non-decorated «series» from the regional Chalcolithic and from specific types of common ware ceramics both marked the formation of the Early Bronze Age, they are also likely to have produced original variations: an authentic mix. This recognition obviously raises problems but will probably help identify the domestic manifestations of the Bell Beaker style. With this aim in mind, we consider that the site of Cassagna 2 constitutes a satisfactory example. The good state of conservation of the surface of sector 2 and the homogeneity of the ceramic series make it possible to suggest their attribution to a stage of regional evolution of the Bell Beaker productions. This would be accomplished without the help of the decorated ceramics, thanks to the presence of characteristics specific to the pottery known as «common ware» within a series not exhibiting, on the contrary, any exclusively Véraza elements. The presence of <b>notched</b> <b>saws,</b> considered as an indication of the Languedoc Chalcolithic, does not go against this proposition. When added to the absence of cordons with digital impressions, it is quite coherent, in this context which is obviously prior to the first expressions of the Early Bronze Age. Moreover, the nature of the surface also evokes a stable establishment for this site which we think has preserved the fleeting imprint of at least one light building of around 16 m 2 (fig. 5). La fouille de sauvetage urgent du site de « Cassagna 2 » menée par l’AFAN en automne 2001 a été motivée par l’aménagement de la ZAC « Aéroconstellation » dans la banlieue toulousaine. Le site archéologique a été reconnu à travers la présence de petites structures fossoyées de type « trou de poteau » et des nappes de mobilier réparties sur près de 5000 m 2. Nous proposons d’attribuer cette occupation à un stade régional de l’évolution du complexe campaniforme, ceci malgré l’absence d’éléments décorés et grâce à une série homogène de vaisselle associant types principaux de la céramique commune et formes hybrides, à l’exclusion de tout élément exclusivement vérazien...|$|R
40|$|Recent field {{investigations}} {{on several}} new Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavements (CRCP) in Belgium indicate that its crack pattern {{is characterized by}} low mean crack spacing along with {{a high percentage of}} clusters of closely spaced cracks. Field surveys also indicate {{that it is difficult to}} significantly reduce the probability of a non-uniform crack pattern - such as closely spaced cracks, meandering, and Y-cracks - by only slightly adjusting the amount of longitudinal steel. Non-uniform crack patterns are inevitable and common in conventional CRCPs. Extensive distress data analyses of many CRCP sections in the United States have shown that the majority of punchouts develop at short spaced transverse cracks. Moreover, a non-uniform crack pattern and a high variability in transverse crack spacing were found to have a higher probability of punchout development. It is generally understood that the long-term performance of a CRCP is largely determined by it early age behaviour. Previous experiences have shown that the early entry method can eliminate the clusters of closely spaced cracks and a more regular crack pattern is achieved. In the present study a new early entry method, partial surface notch, is proposed to improve the crack pattern of CRCP. The primary objective of this study is to optimize the crack spacing pattern of CRCP through an active crack control method. To realize the research objective, predicting the pavement temperature at early age is a good starting point to understand the early age behaviour of CRCP. This study thus firstly provides a procedure to predict the early age temperature development of a concrete pavement based on concrete mixture composition, the thermal characteristics of the concrete and the underneath pavement layers, the environmental conditions, and the construction time and curing methods. Available heat flux models for the pavement surface are initially reviewed and adjustments to improve the accuracy of the predicted early age concrete pavement temperature are suggested. The proposed model enables to simulate the use of blended slag cement and the plastic sheet curing for the Belgium CRCP practice. This temperature model is verified with field measured data of two projects in Belgium, and the result is quite satisfactory. Lastly, an approach is proposed to generate reliable and real-time climatic inputs by using limited weather forecasting climate data for the temperature prediction model during the construction phase. This allows the contractor to optimize construction operations, especially the time of <b>saw</b> cutting. Because <b>notches</b> are made at early age to induce transverse cracks at the designated locations, in addition to the mechanical properties of tensile strength and elastic modulus, the evolution of the fracture energy has to be known to evaluate the cracking tendency of the notched concrete pavement. A deformation-controlled uniaxial tensile test on unnotched specimens is performed for the typical CRCP concrete mixture used in Belgium. Experimental results show that the applied unnotched parabolic shape concrete specimens, the used tension set-up with three hinges, and the applied test procedures succeed in obtaining the complete softening curves for the Belgium CRCP concrete mixtures ranging from 24 hours to 90 days. In order to correlate the concrete properties in field and laboratory conditions for accurately predicting the cracking in a concrete pavement, degree of hydration based descriptions of the early age concrete properties are given based on the experimental results of the tension tests. Using the proposed temperature prediction model and measured early age concrete properties, the concrete stress history at early age is calculated by the superposition principle (through a step-by step numerical method). The time dependent relaxation of the early age concrete, which was described as a function of the degree of hydration is considered as well. The zero stress temperature, peak pavement temperature, built-in temperature gradient, and the cracking time are determined by the estimated early age temperature and stress development. Extensive parametric simulations have shown that the early age concrete temperature and stress development are closely related with various environmental and construction conditions, such as time on the day of concrete placement, construction season, plastic sheet curing, concrete placement temperature etc. A fracture mechanics based procedure is developed to calculate the saw cut depth and saw cut timing for the active crack control method. The estimated final set time gives the lower limit for the saw cutting operation to avoid ravelling while the predicted cracking time indicates the upper limit of the saw cutting window before initiation of randomly occurring natural cracks. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that the applied saw cut depth and saw cut length is appropriate for the current CRCP conditions in Belgium. Extensive field investigations were conducted on two recently constructed CRCP sections in Belgium to evaluate the effect of longitudinal reinforcement percentage and active crack control methods on the crack pattern of CRCP. The crack pattern development, crack width, and crack width movement due to daily temperature variation, were regularly investigated. Field evidences have shown that the proposed active crack control method is very effective in inducing cracks. Moreover, the transverse cracks in the active crack control sections are much straighter and more regular spaced. The active crack control method significantly reduces the percentage of short spaced cracks and cluster cracks and thus reduces the risk of punchout development in the long-term of CRCP.
