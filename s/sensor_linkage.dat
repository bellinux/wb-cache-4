40|$|AbstractFor Bottom Of Basket (BOB) Loss-preventing for Modern Trade Retails camera {{indicates}} the items of shoplifting front end theft accounts of total in-store shrink. BOB shrink is particularly {{hard on a}} store's margins since a single BOB item can often run for example, a 12 -pack of paper towels, a large pack of diapers or a large box of laundry detergent. Just a single loss per lane per day can drive many profit loss for a large grocery chain. Numerous {{attempts have been made}} over the years to combat this problem, the camera and detect <b>sensor</b> <b>linkage</b> at cashier land can integrate with the POS and can recognize what the BOB items is and link it to the item's UPC. That means they can ring up items before lost and can deter collusion, and can stop cashiers from ignoring that an item is {{on the bottom of the}} cart. Lastly, this research vision outlook on next future work activity that will use GUI and orientation product-safety protection sensor to synchronization the 3 D visualization with mobile explorer as a real time product protection on Modern Trade retails location...|$|E
40|$|A Piezoelectric thick-film sensor {{is a good}} {{candidate}} for the extraction of information from object slip in hand prosthesis. Five slip sensors were fabricated on different linkages of an artificial hand. The signals from each sensor were compared to the output from the sensor mounted on the fingertip. An analysis of the output signals from all the sensors indicates that the <b>linkage</b> <b>sensors</b> also produce similar output signals to the fingertip sensor. In the next phase of the research, velocity and acceleration of the slipped object will be considered in the analysis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a direct torque control is applied for salient-pole double star synchronous machine without mechanical speed and stator flux <b>linkage</b> <b>sensors.</b> The estimation {{is performed using}} the extended Kalman filter known by it is ability to process noisy discrete measurements. Two control approaches using fuzzy logic DTC, and neural network DTC are proposed and compared. The validity of the proposed controls scheme is verified by simulation tests of a double star synchronous machine. The stator flux, torque, and speed are determined and compared in the above techniques. Simulation results {{presented in this paper}} highlight the improvements produced by the proposed control method based on the extended Kalman filter under various operation conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – An {{integrated}} neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) {{modeling tool}} {{has been developed}} to facilitate {{the study of the}} control of movement in humans and animals. Blocks representing the skeletal <b>linkage,</b> <b>sensors,</b> muscles, and neural controllers are developed using separate software tools and integrated in the powerful simulation environment of Simulink (Mathworks Inc., USA). Musculoskeletal Modeling in Simulink (MMS) converts anatomically accurate musculoskeletal models generated by SIMM (Musculographics Inc., USA) into Simulink blocks. It also removes runtime constraints in SIMM, and allows the development of complex musculoskeletal models without writing a line of code. Virtual Muscle builds realistic Simulink models of muscle force production under physiologic and pathologic conditions. A generic muscle spindle model has also been developed to simulate the sensory output of the primary and secondary afferents. Neural control models developed by various Matlab (Mathworks Inc., USA) toolboxes can be integrated easily with these model components to build complete NMS models in an integrated environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Sensor {{networks}} are often redundant by design {{in order to}} achieve reliability in information processing. In many cases, the relationships between the different sensors are known a-priori, and can be represented as virtual linkages among the different <b>sensors.</b> These virtual <b>linkages</b> correspond to an information network of sensors, which provides useful external input to the problem of sensor selection. In this paper, we propose the unique approach of using external linkage information in order to improve the efficiency of very large scale sensor selection. We design efficient theoretical models, including a greedy approximation algorithm and an integer programming formulation for sensor selection. Our greedy selection algorithm provides an approximation bound of (e − 1) /(2 · e − 1), wheree is the base of the natural logarithm. We show that our approach is much more effective than baseline sampling strategies. We present experimental results that illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the introduction of}} a new Human Robot Interaction (HRI) sensor for guide robots. Guide robots for geriatric patients or the visually impaired should follow user’s control command, keeping a certain desired distance allowing the user to work freely. Therefore, it is necessary to acquire control commands and a user’s position on a real-time basis. We suggest a new sensor fusion system to achieve this objective and we will call this sensor the “intelligent lead”. The objective of the intelligent lead is to acquire a stable distance from the user to the robot, speed-control volume and turn-control volume, even when the robot platform with the intelligent lead is shaken on uneven ground. In this paper we explain a precise Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) procedure for this. The intelligent lead physically consists of a Kinect <b>sensor,</b> the serial <b>linkage</b> attached with eight rotary encoders, and an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and their measurements are fused by the EKF. A mobile robot was designed to test the performance of the proposed sensor system. After installing the intelligent lead in the mobile robot, several tests are conducted to verify that the mobile robot with the intelligent lead is capable of achieving its goal points while maintaining the appropriate distance between the robot and the user. The results show that we can use the intelligent lead proposed in this paper as a new HRI sensor joined a joystick and a distance measure in the mobile environments such as the robot and the user are moving at the same time...|$|R
40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} use {{of mobile}} devices, <b>sensors,</b> and the <b>linkage</b> between them open up opportunities for new applications using near real-time data processing and analytics. Demands on information systems are high: {{huge amounts of}} data have to be processed and results have to be delivered in near real-time. These needs are tackled by the field of Data Stream Management. Processing data streams differs in many ways from static data set processing {{as much of the}} data cannot be stored persistently. Likewise, development methods for data stream-based applications have to be specifically adapted. Process modeling has proved to increase the quality of information systems, but there exists no model specifically for data stream applications. Furthermore, the production of high quality applications requires means for a structured, iterative evaluation of the application and its outcomes. Particularly, applications fed by unreliable data sources, such as sensors, are prone to quality losses and errors. Hence, measurement, monitoring, and optionally the correction of data quality problems must take a crucial part in the development and evaluation of data stream applications. Data quality management needs to be domain and application independent and smoothly integrated into a data stream management system. These requirements have not been met satisfactorily so far. We counter the aforementioned issues by three main contributions. First, we propose a process model specifically tailored to the design, implementation, and, in particular, for the evaluation of data stream applications. To this end, we contribute a thorough analysis of data stream management principles and technologies. We also analyze existing process models in information management and discuss their suitability to data stream applications. Second, we propose evaluation methodologies embedded into the process model. Along these methodologies we design and implement a flexible evaluation framework for data stream applications. Finally, we propose a methodology and framework for data quality management for data stream applications. We first analyze quality dimensions and metrics relevant to data stream applications. We elicitate existing data quality management methodologies and present a methodology for data stream-based applications. As a major contribution we implement a flexible, domain and application independent data quality management framework for relational data stream management systems based on the proposed methodology. The process model and frameworks have been developed and empirically validated and evaluated in the context of two domains, namely Connected Intelligent Transportation Systems and Mobile Health. Algorithmic solutions for particular problems in the target domains have been devised and applied. Iterative evaluations using the proposed frameworks led to crucial optimizations of the application results...|$|R
