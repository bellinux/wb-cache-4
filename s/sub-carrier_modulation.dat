40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for high speed wireless connectivity at low cost proposes new challenges for communication systems designers to implement solutions {{that increase the}} data rate by utilizing the limited radio resources more efficiently at a low additional complexity. <b>Sub-carrier</b> Adaptive <b>Modulation</b> and Coding (AMC) exploits the high frequency diversity in wideband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channels to obtain higher data rates. While prior work has discussed the value of sub-carrier AMC from a theoretical perspective, this work presents the design and performance of a real-time sub-carrier AMC system. We describe our OFDM transceiver prototype, which implements real-time subcarrier AMC for a wideband wireless channel. We discuss how our design achieves accurate and consistent Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) estimates, which are critical {{for the success of}} AMC. We compare the performance of sub-carrier AMC with a non-adaptive scheme that assigns the same modulation and channel coding to all sub-carriers that can support that modulation and coding for the target Bit Error Rate (BER). For a conservative comparison, we compare against the uniform modulation/coding assignment that achieves the highest data rate. Our experiments over the wireless channel show that for a target coded BER of 10 - 5, our system achieves average data rates of 308. 3 and 237. 1 Mbps across a variety of Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non Line-of-Sight (NLOS) locations respectively, which result in 34 % and 40 % gain over the best non-adaptive scheme.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThe next {{generation}} mobile networks {{are expected to}} provide multimedia applications with a high quality of service. On the other hand, interference among multiple base stations (BS) that co-exist in the same location limits the capacity of wireless networks. In conventional wireless networks, the base stations do not cooperate with each other. The BSs transmit individually to their respective mobile stations (MS) and treat the transmission from other BSs as interference. An alternative to this structure is a network cooperation structure. Here, BSs cooperate with other BSs to simultaneously transmit to their respective MSs using the same frequency band {{at a given time}} slot. By doing this, we significantly increase the capacity of the networks. This thesis presents novel research results on a noncooperative transmission scheme and a cooperative transmission scheme for multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM). We first consider the performance limit of a noncooperative transmission scheme. Here, we propose a method to reduce the interference and increase the throughput of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in co-working wireless local area networks (WLANs) by using joint adaptive multiple antennas(AMA) and adaptive modulation (AM) with acknowledgement (ACK) Eigen-steering. The calculation of AMA and AM are performed at the receiver. The AMA is used to suppress interference and to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The AM scheme is used to allocate OFDM <b>sub-carriers,</b> power, and <b>modulation</b> mode subject to the constraints of power, discrete modulation, and the bit error rate (BER). The transmit weights, the allocation of power, and the allocation of sub-carriers are obtained at the transmitter using ACK Eigen-steering. The derivations of AMA, AM, and ACK Eigen-steering are shown. The performance of joint AMA and AM for various AMA configurations is evaluated through the simulations of BER and spectral efficiency (SE) against SIR. To improve the performance of the system further, we propose a practical cooperative transmission scheme to mitigate against the interference in co-working WLANs. Here, we consider a network coordination among BSs. We employ Tomlinson Harashima precoding (THP), joint transmit-receive beamforming based on SINR (signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio) maximization, and an adaptive precoding order to eliminate co-working interference and achieve bit error rate (BER) fairness among different users. We also consider the design of the system when partial channel state information (CSI) (where each user only knows its own CSI) and full CSI (where each user knows CSI of all users) are available at the receiver respectively. We prove analytically and by simulation that the performance of our proposed scheme will not be degraded under partial CSI. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme considerably outperforms both the existing noncooperative and cooperative transmission schemes. A method to design a spectrally efficient cooperative downlink transmission scheme employing precoding and beamforming is also proposed. The algorithm eliminates the interference and achieves symbol error rate (SER) fairness among different users. To eliminate the interference, Tomlinson Harashima precoding (THP) is used to cancel part of the interference while the transmit-receive antenna weights cancel the remaining one. A new novel iterative method is applied to generate the transmit-receive antenna weights. To achieve SER fairness among different users and further improve the performance of MIMO systems, we develop algorithms that provide equal SINR across all users and order the users so that the minimum SINR for each user is maximized. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme considerably outperforms existing cooperative transmission schemes in terms of the SER performance and complexity and approaches an interference free performance under the same configuration. We could improve the performance of the proposed interference cancellation further. This is because the proposed interference cancellation does not consider receiver noise when calculating the transmit-receive weight antennas. In addition, the proposed scheme mentioned above is designed specifically for a single-stream multi-user transmission. Here, we employ THP precoding and an iterative method based on the uplink-downlink duality principle to generate the transmit-receive antenna weights. The algorithm provides an equal SINR across all users. A simpler method is then proposed by trading off the complexity with a slight performance degradation. The proposed methods are extended to also work when the receiver does not have complete Channel State Informations (CSIs). A new method of setting the user precoding order, which has a much lower complexity than the VBLAST type ordering scheme but with almost the same performance, is also proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes considerably outperform existing cooperative transmission schemes in terms of SER performance and approach an interference free performance. In all the cooperative transmission schemes proposed above, we use THP to cancel part of the interference. In this thesis, we also consider an alternative approach that bypasses the use of THP. The task of cancelling the interference from other users now lies solely within the transmit-receive antenna weights. We consider multiuser Gaussian broadcast channels with multiple antennas at both transmitter and receivers. An iterative multiple beamforming (IMB) algorithm is proposed, which is flexible in the antenna configuration and performs well in low to moderate data rates. Its capacity and bit error rate performance are compared with the ones achieved by the traditional zero-forcing method...|$|R
