5000|$|<b>Printer</b> <b>Spooling</b> - Later {{versions}} of the Econet printer server software used <b>printer</b> <b>spooling</b> to locally cache print jobs before sending to the remote printer. This ensured whole print jobs {{were sent to the}} printer in one go.|$|R
50|$|Win32 APIs {{also allow}} {{applications}} to send data {{directly to the}} <b>spooler,</b> bypassing the <b>printer</b> driver; however, few applications actually use this option.|$|R
50|$|LPRng is a {{printing}} system {{compatible with the}} Berkeley printing system. It provides <b>printer</b> <b>spooling</b> and network print server functionality using the Line Printer Daemon protocol.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes the {{operator}} requires a dedicated, live printer - for example, when printing receipts for customers in real time, don't use <b>spooling.</b> Use the <b>PRINTER</b> OCL statement {{to declare the}} symbolic print job to be unspooled (SPOOL-NO.) ...|$|R
50|$|Symptoms {{also include}} {{spontaneous}} disconnection of workstations from networks {{and creation of}} large <b>printer</b> <b>spooling</b> files. Disconnections occur since Jerusalem uses the 'interrupt 21h' low-level DOS functions that Novell Netware and other networking implementations required to hook into the file system.|$|R
5000|$|Amiga {{internal}} function [...] "PWrite" [...] of printer.device writes 'length' bytes {{directly to}} the printer. This function is generally called on by printer drivers to send their buffer(s) to the printer. Number of buffers are decided by the persons who created the driver. Amiga lacked a standard <b>Printer</b> <b>Spooler.</b>|$|R
50|$|Others were novel, {{including}} protocols for <b>printer</b> <b>spooling,</b> copying disk packs, page-level {{remote access}} to file servers, name lookup, remote management, etc. (although some of these capabilities had been seen before, e.g. the ARPANET already made heavy use of remote management for controlling the Interface Message Processors which made it up).|$|R
50|$|This fact led Amiga {{users to}} prefer third party Printer Systems {{with their own}} drivers, like TurboPrint and PrintStudio, which {{introduced}} not only recent drivers, but also featured a functioning <b>Printer</b> <b>Spooler</b> into Amiga, and featured 16 millions colors printing. MorphOS uses a special version of TurboPrint to pilot recent printers.|$|R
50|$|Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 {{introduce}} print driver isolation, which {{improves the}} reliability of the print <b>spooler</b> by running <b>printer</b> drivers in a separate process to the spooler service. If a third party print driver fails while isolated, it does not impact other drivers or the print spooler service.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the B5500 Master Control Program (MCP) {{operating}} system included virtual printers, called [...] "Printer Backups" [...] {{in the form}} of Printer Backup Tapes (PBT) and Printer Backup Disks (PBD). IBM's VM/370 operating system allows users to <b>spool</b> a virtual <b>printer</b> (or punch) file to another user, who can read it as input. This provides a basic means of file transfer.|$|R
50|$|Notably, in Windows NT 3.x, several I/O driver {{subsystems}}, such as {{video and}} printing, were user-mode subsystems. In Windows NT 4, the video, server, and <b>printer</b> <b>spooler</b> subsystems were moved into kernel mode. Windows NT's first GUI was {{strongly influenced by}} (and programmatically compatible with) that from Windows 3.1; Windows NT 4's interface was redesigned to match that of the brand new Windows 95, moving from the Program Manager to the Windows shell design.|$|R
50|$|Garriott {{began writing}} {{computer}} games in 1974. His first games were created on and for teletype terminals. The code was stored on paper tape spools {{and the game}} was displayed as an ongoing print-out on the <b>spools</b> of <b>printer</b> paper produced by teletype machines. In summer 1979, Garriott worked at a ComputerLand store where he had his first encounter with Apple computers. Inspired by their video monitors with color graphics, he began to add perspective view to his own games. After he created Akalabeth for fun, {{the owner of the}} store convinced Garriott it might sell. Garriott spent US$200 printing copies of a manual and cover sheet that his mother had drawn, then he put copies of the game in Ziploc bags to sell at the store. Although Garriott sold fewer than a dozen copies of Akalabeth at the store, one copy made it to California Pacific, who signed a deal with him. The game sold over 30,000 copies, and Garriott received $5 for each copy sold. Akalabeth is considered the first published Computer Role Playing Game. In the fall, Garriott entered the University of Texas at Austin, joined the school's fencing team and later joined the Society for Creative Anachronism. He created Ultima I while at the university. It was published by California Pacific Computers and sold in Ziploc plastic bags, as was common in those days.|$|R
40|$|Printers and PDF {{are part}} of our day to day life; {{enhanced}} performance of a printer will benefit the users by great deal. Type conversion method proposed to improve performance by overcoming limitation of applications that render characters as shape rather than text which slows down the printer as a PDF file is composed of thousands of character. Rendering of character as shape will increase spool size of the printer since instruction related to every single character construction has to be stored such as number of, path construction commands(moveto, curveto and so on) along with their co-ordinate points. Proposed paper deals with the method to convert subset embedded font in to complete font file say TTF, by adding essential missing data and then rendering them using language framework fonts which results in rendering as text instead of shape,. ultimately reducing the <b>printer</b> <b>spool</b> size and enhances the performance of application.

5000|$|In computing, {{spooling}} is {{a specialized}} form of multi-programming {{for the purpose}} of copying data between different devices. In contemporary systems it is usually used for mediating between a computer application and a slow peripheral, such as a <b>printer.</b> <b>Spooling</b> allows programs to [...] "hand off" [...] work to be done by the peripheral and then proceed to other tasks, or do not begin until input has been transcribed. A dedicated program, the spooler, maintains an orderly sequence of jobs for the peripheral and feeds it data at its own rate. Conversely, for slow input peripherals, such as a card reader, a spooler can maintain a sequence of computational jobs waiting for data, starting each job when all of the relevant input is available; see batch processing. The spool itself refers to the sequence of jobs, or the storage area where they are held. In many cases the spooler is able to drive devices at their full rated speed with minimal impact on other processing.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} science, a {{data buffer}} (or just buffer) is {{a region of}} a physical memory storage used to temporarily store data while it is being moved {{from one place to}} another. Typically, the data is stored in a buffer as it is retrieved from an input device (such as a microphone) or just before it is sent to an output device (such as speakers). However, a buffer may be used when moving data between processes within a computer. This is comparable to buffers in telecommunication. Buffers can be implemented in a fixed memory location in hardwareâ€”or by using a virtual data buffer in software, pointing at a location in the physical memory. In all cases, the data stored in a data buffer are stored on a physical storage medium. A majority of buffers are implemented in software, which typically use the faster RAM to store temporary data, due to the much faster access time compared with hard disk drives. Buffers are typically used when {{there is a difference between}} the rate at which data is received and the rate at which it can be processed, or in the case that these rates are variable, for example in a <b>printer</b> <b>spooler</b> or in online video streaming.|$|R
50|$|Also {{available}} for the Commodore 64 was the Creative Micro Designs CMD HD-Series. Much like the Commodore 1541 floppy drive, the CMD HD could connect to the Commodore 64's serial bus, and could operate independently of the computer {{with the help of}} its on-board hardware. A CMD HD series drive included its own SCSI controller to operate its hard drive mechanism, in addition to hosting a battery powered real-time clock module for the time-stamping of files. The stock operating speeds of the CMD HD-Series units were not very much faster than the stock speeds of a 1541 floppy drive, but the units were fully JiffyDOS compatible. Faster parallel transfers were possible with the addition of another CMD product, the CMD RAMLink and a special parallel transfer cable. With this arrangement, the performance of the system doubled that of the Lt. Kernal. One advantage the CMD products had was software compatibility, especially with GEOS, that prior solutions lacked. CMD ultimately missed opportunities to develop any features for the drive's auxiliary port (such as a <b>printer</b> <b>spooler</b> feature promised in the CMD HD user manual). Support for external SCSI devices (such as CD-ROM and Zip drives) was also noticeably missing. SCSI devices could be connected and chained to the external SCSI port, but could not be used from the HD without workarounds or special software.|$|R
