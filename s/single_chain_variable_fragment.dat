40|$|Abstract Background The {{display of}} binding ligands, such as {{recombinant}} antibody fragments, {{on the surface}} of filamentous phage makes it possible to specifically attach these phage particles to target cells. After uptake of the phage, their internal single-stranded DNA is processed by the host cell, which allows transient expression of an encoded eukaryotic gene cassette. This opens the possibility to use bacteriophage as vectors for targeted gene therapy, although the transduction efficiency is very low. Results Here we demonstrate the display of an anti-CD 30 <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> <b>variable</b> <b>fragment</b> fused to the major coat protein pVIII {{on the surface of}} bacteriophage. These phage particles showed an improved binding and transduction efficiency of CD 30 positive Hodgkin-lymphoma cells, compared to bacteriophage with the anti-CD 30 <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> <b>variable</b> <b>fragment</b> fused to the minor coat protein pIII. Conclusion We can conclude from the results that the postulated multivalency of the anti-CD 30 -pVIII displaying bacteriophage combined with disseminated display of the anti-CD 30 scFv on the whole particle surface is responsible for the improved gene transfer rate. These results mark an important step towards the use of phage particles as a cheap and safe gene transfer vehicle for the gene delivery of the desired target cells via their specific surface receptors. </p...|$|E

The optimization of processes and environmental conditions is necessary to increase the production yields and enhance the productivity.

Methods: In this research, physical and chemical factors influencing the batch fermentation was investigated in 50 mL batch tubes using minimum media to find the optimum conditions for production of a <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> <b>variable</b> <b>fragment</b> antibody in the Escherichia coli HB 2151. Experimental designs were used to screen the effective parameters and to optimize the main factors. Results: Arabinose was used instead of IPTG as a cheaper and nontoxic inducer and its optimum concentration was determined 0. 1 % (w/w). Induction duration time and filling volume fraction were set on the relatively better states 24 hours and 1 / 10 respectively. Regarding our previous study, stationary phase of the cell growth was selected as induction start time that showed higher specific scFv production yields (YP/X) in the minimum media. Finally, a statistical experimental design was extended to a central composite design (CCD) and analysis was performed based on sucrose and sorbitol concentrations producing osmotic condition for induction. The optimum region in the contour plot for the periplasmic scFv production was an osmotic circle area with total sugar molarity 0. 8 to 0. 9. Conclusion: Sugars such as sucrose and sorbitol producing osmotic conditions could lead to periplasmic scFv concentrations up to 2. 85 mg/L of culture media improving scFv concentration near to five times of the average of the screening step (0. 59 mg/L) ...|$|E
