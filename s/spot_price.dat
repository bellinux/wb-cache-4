In efficient markets, futures prices are an unbiased estimator of <b>spot</b> <b>prices</b> when the future contract matures (Gardner 1976; Liang et al. 2011). When no futures prices are available (for example, {{in countries where}} commodity exchanges are missing), <b>spot</b> <b>prices</b> also convey relevant information about expected future prices due to inter-temporal arbitrage of grain storage. If stocks are non-zero, current <b>spot</b> <b>prices</b> are in equilibrium with future prices and a change of expected future prices therefore leads to a change of <b>spot</b> <b>prices</b> (Fama and French 1987; Hernandez and Torero 2010).|$|R
40|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{nature of}} electricity distinguishes its <b>spot</b> <b>prices</b> from <b>spot</b> <b>prices</b> for equities and other commodities. Up to now electricity cannot be stored economically and therefore demand for electricity has an untempered effect on electricity prices. In particular, hourly electricity <b>spot</b> <b>prices</b> show a vast range of dynamics which can change rapidly. In this paper we introduce a robust version of functional {{principal component analysis}} for sparse data. The functional perspective interprets <b>spot</b> <b>prices</b> as functions of demand for electricity and allows to estimate a single price curve for each day. Variations in market fundamentals such as commodity prices are absorbed by the first principal components. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{holder of}} an American style call option can sell his option holding {{at any time}} until the {{expiration}} date, and would consider doing so when the stock's <b>spot</b> <b>price</b> is above the exercise price, especially if he expects {{the price of the}} option to drop. By selling the option early in that situation, the trader can realise an immediate profit. Alternatively, he can exercise the option — for example, if there is no secondary market for the options — and then sell the stock, realising a profit. A trader would make a profit if the <b>spot</b> <b>price</b> of the shares rises by more than the premium. For example, if the exercise price is 100 and premium paid is 10, then if the <b>spot</b> <b>price</b> of 100 rises to only 110 the transaction is break-even; an increase in stock price above 110 produces a profit.|$|E

25|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{decrease}} {{can buy a}} put option to sell the stock at a fixed price ("strike price") at a later date. The trader will be {{under no obligation to}} sell the stock, but only has the right to do so at or before the expiration date. If the stock price at expiration is below the exercise price by more than the premium paid, he will make a profit. If the stock price at expiration is above the exercise price, he will let the put contract expire and only lose the premium paid. In the transaction, the premium also plays a major role as it enhances the break-even point. For example, if exercise price is 100, premium paid is 10, then a <b>spot</b> <b>price</b> of 100 to 90 is not profitable. He would make a profit if the <b>spot</b> <b>price</b> is below 90.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} different periodic extensions of regression models with autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average disturbances {{for the analysis}} of daily <b>spot</b> <b>prices</b> of electricity. We show that day-of-the-week periodicity and long memory are important determinants for the dynamic modelling of the conditional mean of electricity <b>spot</b> <b>prices.</b> Once an effective description of the conditional mean of <b>spot</b> <b>prices</b> is empirically identified, focus can be directed towards volatility features of the time series. For the older electricity market of Nord Pool in Norway, it is found that a long memory model with periodic coefficients is required to model daily <b>spot</b> <b>prices</b> effectively. Further, strong evidence of conditional heteroskedasticity is found in the mean corrected Nord Pool series. For daily prices at three emerging electricity markets that we consider (APX in The Netherlands, EEX in Germany and Powernext in France) periodicity in the autoregressive coefficients is also stablished, but evidence of long memory is not found and existence of dynamic behaviour in the variance of the <b>spot</b> <b>prices</b> is less pronounced.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>spot</b> and futures <b>prices</b> for {{a broad range of}} commodities, including energy, precious and base metals, and agricultural commodities. In particular, we examine whether futures prices are (1) an unbiased and/or (2) accurate predictor of subsequent <b>spot</b> <b>prices.</b> While energy futures prices are generally unbiased predictors of future <b>spot</b> <b>prices,</b> there is much stronger evidence against the null for other commodity markets. This difference appears to be driven in part by the depth of each market. We find that over the last five years, it is much harder to reject the null of futures prices being unbiased predictors of future <b>spot</b> <b>prices</b> than in earlier periods for almost all commodities. In addition, futures prices do approximately as well as a random walk in forecasting future <b>spot</b> <b>prices,</b> and vastly outperform a reduced form empirical model. ...|$|R

Furthermore, using cointegration techniques the unbiasedness hypothesis for future prices as predictors of realized <b>spot</b> <b>prices</b> could not be rejected. When the sample is divided into sub-periods, the absence of bias in futures prices is rejected. ...|$|R

25|$|In {{different}} deregulation processes {{the institutions}} and market designs were often very different {{but many of the}} underlying concepts were the same.

25|$|As of July 2014, {{the price}} of uranium {{concentrate}} remained near a five-year low, the uranium price having fallen more than 50% from the peak <b>spot</b> <b>price</b> in January 2011, reflecting the loss of Japanese demand following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. As a result of continued low prices, in February 2014 mining company Cameco deferred plans to expand production from existing Canadian mines, although it continued work {{to open a new}} mine at Cigar Lake.

25|$|Future {{contracts}} are another way our farmer can hedge his risk without {{a few of}} the risks that forward contracts have. Future {{contracts are}} similar to forward contracts except they are more standardized (i.e. each contract is the same quantity and date for everyone). These contracts trade on exchanges and are guaranteed through clearinghouses. Clearinghouses ensure that every contract is honored and they take the opposite side of every contract. Future contracts typically are more liquid than forward contracts and move with the market. Because of this, the farmer can minimize the risk he faces in the future through the selling of future contracts. Future contracts also differ from forward contracts in that delivery never happens. The exchanges and clearinghouses allow the buyer or seller to leave the contract early and cash out. So tying back into the farmer selling his wheat at a future date, he will sell short futures contracts for the amount that he predicts to harvest to protect against a price decrease. The current (<b>spot)</b> <b>price</b> of wheat and the price of the futures contracts for wheat converge as time gets closer to the delivery date, so in order to make money on the hedge, the farmer must close out his position earlier than then. On the chance that prices decrease in the future, the farmer will make a profit on his short position in the futures market which offsets any decrease in revenues from the spot market for wheat. On the other hand, if prices increase, the farmer will generate a loss on the futures market which is offset by an increase in revenues on the spot market for wheat. Instead of agreeing to sell his wheat to one person on a set date, the farmer will just buy and sell futures on an exchange and then sell his wheat wherever he wants once he harvests it.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Spot</b> <b>pricing</b> is {{considered}} as a significant supplement for building a full-fledged market economy for the Cloud ecosystem. However, it seems that both providers and consumers are still hesitating to enter the Cloud spot market. The relevant academic community also has conflicting opinions about Cloud <b>spot</b> <b>pricing</b> in terms of revenue generation. Aim: This work aims to systematically identify, assess, synthesize and report the published evidence in favor of or against spot-price scheme compared with fixed-price scheme of Cloud computing, so as to help relieve the aforementioned conflict. Method: We employed the systematic literature review (SLR) method to collect and investigate the empirical studies of Cloud <b>spot</b> <b>pricing</b> indexed by major electronic libraries. Results: This SLR identified 61 primary studies that either delivered discussions or conducted experiments to perform comparison between <b>spot</b> <b>pricing</b> and fixed pricing in the Cloud domain. The reported benefits and limitations were summarized to facilitate cost-benefit analysis of being a Cloud <b>spot</b> <b>pricing</b> player, while four types of theories were distinguished to help both researchers and practitioners better understand the Cloud spot market. Conclusions: This SLR shows that the academic community strongly advocates the emerging Cloud spot market. Although {{there is still a}} lack of practical and easily deployable market-driven mechanisms, the overall findings of our work indicate that <b>spot</b> <b>pricing</b> plays a promising role in the sustainability of Cloud resource exploitation...|$|R
