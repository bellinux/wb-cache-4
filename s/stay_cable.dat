Although a falling <b>stay</b> <b>cable</b> cut through a local church and across the transmitter site buildings, no one was injured. It completely disabled the BBC2 UHF transmitter and the ITV VHF transmitter, leaving several million people without service. BBC1 VHF television transmissions continued from Holme Moss. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) owned a collapsible emergency mast, 61 m tall, which was moved to Emley from the Lichfield transmitting station so that some service could be restored. ITV signals were restored to 2.5 million viewers within four days. The BBC provided a mobile mast on an outside broadcast van to restore a restricted BBC2 colour service within two days. The ITA bought a larger temporary mast from a Swedish company. A crew of Polish riggers were hired, and a 204 m mast was erected in under 28 days {{at a cost of}} Â£100,000. This mast could hold only one set of antennas, so many viewers in outlying areas still could not receive colour programmes. The taller mast was brought into service on 16 April. Some weeks later, the BBC erected a 91 m mast, improving coverage.|$|E

Nonlinear dynamic model of the stayed-cable and beam coupling system is dispersed in temporal dimension by using the finite difference method. The discrete nonlinear vibration equations of any cable element are worked out.

So the particle filter algorithm can use the accurate state equations. Finally, the particle filter algorithm is used to filter the vibration signal of bridge <b>stayed</b> <b>cable.</b> According to the particle filter, the de-noised vibration signal can be tracked and be predicted for a short time accurately. Many experiments are done at some actual bridges.

40|$|Wind-rain-induced {{vibration}} of {{stay cables}} in cable-stayed bridges has been increasingly concerned by engineering professions. This paper presents {{a framework for}} estimating occurrence probability of wind-rain-induced <b>stay</b> <b>cable</b> vibration to facilitate the engineering decision on the implementation of anti-vibration system. The proposed framework is founded on the statistical analysis of wind speed, wind direction and rainfall intensity and the theoretical analysis of occurrence range of wind-rain-induced <b>stay</b> <b>cable</b> vibration. The {{joint probability density function}} of wind speed and wind direction, and the probability density function of rainfall intensity are first obtained for the site of a bridge through the statistical analysis. The occurrence range of wind speed and wind direction for wind-rain-induced vibration of a <b>stay</b> <b>cable</b> greater than a vibration amplitude threshold value is then found based on a theoretical model recently developed. The occurrence probability and risk of wind-rain-induced <b>stay</b> <b>cable</b> vibration are finally calculated according to the probability theory.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical model for investigating wind-rain-induced vibration {{and control of}} stay cables in a cable-stayed bridge. The single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) wind-rain excitation model developed from a sectional cable model is applied to a taut <b>stay</b> <b>cable,</b> taking into consideration the variation of mean wind speed along the <b>stay</b> <b>cable</b> {{and the effect of}} mode shapes of cable vibration. The computed results from the analytical model are then compared with the available field measurement results. After comparison, the parameter studies are performed to explore the mechanism of windrain-induced vibration of stay cables. The analytical model developed in this study can also consider cable vibration control, in which a linear viscous damper is attached to the <b>stay</b> <b>cable</b> near its anchorage. Clamped and undamped mode shapes of the <b>stay</b> <b>cable</b> and the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method are used to find the numerical solutions. The numerical results show that there is an optimum damping coefficient of the viscous damper to achieve the best mitigation of wind-rain-induced cable vibration.
