Because some of the fission products, in their fluoride form, are highly water-soluble, fluorides are less suited to long-term storage.

50|$|In a {{toroidal}} {{fusion power}} device, a plasma is confined within a donut-shaped cylinder. If the gas {{pressure of the}} plasma varies across the radius of the cylinder, a self-generated current will spontaneously arise within the plasma, due to collisions between trapped particles and passing particles. The latter current is called the bootstrap current, and is commonly found in tokamak fusion devices. The tokamak uses a combination of external magnets and a current driven in the plasma to create a <b>stable</b> <b>confinement</b> system. One goal of advanced tokamak designs is to maximize the bootstrap current, and thereby reduce or {{eliminate the need for}} an external current driver. This could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of the device.|$|E

Debates about the welfare and abuse of horses are recent. In the nineteenth century, when the sight of a horse dying while working was commonplace, the first wave of awareness was born with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the publication of the novel Black Beauty in England. France followed suit with the creation of the French League for the Protection of the Horse and the passage of the Grammont Law in 1850. Similar concerns over animal welfare developed in the United States. The debate intensified and extended throughout North America and Europe over the next century, particularly regarding the use of the horse during war, the use of horses as working animals on city streets, sports training, horse slaughter, and conditions of horse breeding and keeping. In the United States, the practice of soring resulted in the passage of the Horse Protection Act of 1970 and various organizations protested against abuses in horse racing and rodeo. In the early twenty-first century, these issues remained in the public eye and new controversies arose, especially about training methods such as Rollkur, problems in the field of endurance riding, <b>stable</b> <b>confinement,</b> and the presence of carriage horses in modern cities such as New York.|$|E

30|$|For <b>stable</b> <b>confinement</b> {{of a gas}} plasma, it is {{important}} to keep electrical neutrality of a gas. Therefore, such a supplemental magnetic mirror as in Fig.  7 must have the same value of loss angle both for electrons and for ions. However, from the examination in Section 3, confining D+ ions will be the more difficult challenge. As a more realistic approach than producing an extremely powerful high-frequency electric field, we consider the following: (1) We first suppress the escaping number of D+ ions as much as possible. (2) For the loss of still uncontrolled D+ ions, we replenish D+ ions from an external plasma source into the space between planes (d) and (e). In magnetic mirror experiments, a general method for plasma production is to create a weakly ionized plasma in advance and inject high energy charged particles from outside. The DCX device at Oak Ridge National Laboratory [10] created a gas plasma by injecting a 600 -keV beam of H_ 2 ^+ ions. We could apply that technical method as a means for replenishing escaping D+ ions.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from a recent multidecade study of the spot {{activity}} of young solar-like stars, based on photometry gathered at the Fairborn observatory since 1987. Our period analysis of this photometry reveals systematic tendencies in the stellar rotation and activity behaviour with respect to stellar mass. Period variations seen in the light curves point to a flat rotation dependence of the absolute equator to pole differential rotation. Activity cycles are commonly seen in the light curve mean levels and amplitudes and their lengths fall on distinct branches {{when compared to the}} Rossby number and chromospheric activity levels. Our results indicate that there are systematic simultaneously excitable cycle modes present in the active stars {{in the form of a}} previously undescribed split into two parallel cycle branches. Several of the studied stars have superimposed cycles belonging to both of the parallel branches. Active longitudes are also frequently seen on the more active stars and range from short lived structures lasting for a few years into highly <b>stable</b> longitudinal <b>confinement</b> of the observed activity over decades. We find, however, that there is a sharp transition between weakly and strongly active stars so that only stars with a sufficiently high activity level have clearly developed active longitudes. When active longitudes do appear, they commonly have a markedly shorter rotation period than the photospheric mean rotation period, recovered from direct light curve period analysis. This may be a signature of radial differential rotation or that the active longitudes follow an azimuthal dynamo wave...|$|R

In this work, we report de-agglomeration of nanodiamond (ND) by using a facile technique namely, salt-assisted ultrasonic de-agglomeration (SAUD). Utilizing ultrasound energy and ionic salts (sodium chloride and sodium acetate), SAUD is expected to break apart thermally treated nanodiamond aggregates (~ 50 – 100 nm) and produce an aqueous slurry of de-aggregated stable colloidal nanodiamond dispersions by virtue of ionic interactions and electrostatic stabilization. Moreover, the SAUD technique neither has toxic chemicals nor is it difficult to remove impurities and therefore the isolated nanodiamonds produced are exceptionally suited for engineered nanocarbon for mechanical (composites, lubricants) and biomedical (bio-labeling, biosensing, bioimaging, theranostic) applications. We characterized the microscopic structure using complementary techniques including transmission electron microscopy combined with selected-area electron diffraction, optical and vibrational spectroscopy.

Numerical modeling of charged particle orbits that pass through the regions of these local field minima has been carried out using different seasonal Earth tilt and different magnetospheric disturbance level. These orbit tracings show when and where these off-equatorial trapped radiation zones would be situated. The existence and extent of these confinement zones depend on the tilt angle. Indeed, the northern cusp confinement zone appears only at the northern summer solstice, while the southern cusp particle capture zone appears around winter solstice. The particle orbits that pass through opposite off-equatorial field minimum during solstices reveal a bound of the geomagnetic equatorial plane on the day sector.

Time-resolved stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements have been performed in a cross-flow plane located 0. 3 D downstream of the model base. An increasing displacement of the backflow region from the body centerline with increasing pitch angles is observed in the long-time average of the velocity field, {{with the emergence of}} a preferred orientation of the wake. The time history of the backflow centroid position shows a progressive reduction of both amplitude and time scales of the fluctuations, reflecting the transition from large-scale azimuthal meandering to a more <b>stable</b> <b>confinement</b> at an off-center position. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of the velocity fluctuations reveals a reduction by approximately 80 % in the contribution of the first two modes for angles increasing up to 1 °, accompanied by a distortion of the dipolar distribution typically associated with backflow meandering, for misalignments from 0. 3 ° and higher. The frequency spectra of the POD time-coefficients display a very-lowfrequency peak near StD ~ 10 - 3 only within 0. 1 ° deviations from axisymmetric inflow conditions, thus endorsing the hypothesis that the long-term backflow instability only survives within small deviations from axisymmetric inflow conditions.

Lactate concentration in the blood was measured by spectrophotometry on days 1 (Lac 01), 14 (Lac 14), 27 (Lac 27) and 69 (Lac 69) of the feedlot period and immediately after slaughter (Lac 96). Fresh meat samples were collected from the Longissimus thoracis muscle for determination of luminosity (L *), red (a *) and yellow (b *) intensity, shear force and pH of unaged meat and aged for seven days. Lactate concentrations were analyzed by the PROC MIXED of the SAS program, considering in the model the effects of pen and day of blood samples collection. Simple correlations between the studied variables were estimated using the procedure CORR of the program SAS. The lactate was <b>stable</b> during the <b>confinement</b> period, with mean values equal to 4. 83 ± 0. 30 mMol/L; 5. 68 ± 0. 29 mMol/L; 5. 03 ± 0. 29 mMol/L and 4. 15 ± 0. 31 mMol/L for Lac 01, Lac 14, Lac 21 and Lac 69, respectively.

40|$|In this work, {{different}} paths to confined crystallisation of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) havebeen explored. Innate confinement effects {{due to the}} presence of bulky end groups wereshown to affect crystalline characteristics for strictly monodisperse ε-caprolactone oligomers. The interaction between end groups and end groups, as well as that between end groups andε-caprolactone repeating units, created an obstacle for unfolding the crystal structures that hadinitially formed even at the high-temperature limit of crystallisation where crystallisationoccurred over hundreds of hours. Very rapid X-ray imaging of the in situ crystallisationprocess showed that rapid shifts in the unit cell occurred during the first minute ofcrystallisation due to the difficulty of fitting the bulky end groups in a <b>stable</b> unit cell. <b>Confinement</b> effects also arose when polymer chains were crystallised in systems with smallpore sizes. For linear poly-ε-caprolactone, chains confinement depended mainly on thedimensionalities of the pores. Linear polymers with Mn = 10 000 and 42 500 were stronglyinhibited from forming crystal structures in 10 nm pore systems, but not hindered in 23 nmpore systems. Linear polymers with Mn = 80 000 also experienced limited confinement in the 23 nm pores. A star-shaped oligomer with four arms of approximately Mn = 1 000 each evenexperienced confinement in 290 nm pores, although having smaller molecular size and radiusof gyration compared to the linear chains. The innate confinement created by the challenge ofpacking four arms amplified the effect of physical confinement. Another limitation wascreated on the crystallisation process by solving PCL in supercritical CO 2 and depositingduring extremely fast phase transfer to gas-like state. The formed structures were limited bythe very low temperature that resulted from the phase change and by the rapid evaporation ofthe solvent. These limitations resulted in entrapment of crystal structures in metastablephases. As a consequence, crystals of hitherto unreported rectangular form were observed aswell as the common six-sided form. The former crystals had considerably lower melting pointcompared to the latter. X-ray analysis showed that two sets of lattice constants existed,supporting the notion of entrapment in metastable phases. Another way of achievingconfinement was precise deposition of droplets in the pikolitre volume range of highly dilutesolutions. The microcrystals which formed were confined by both the low polymer content ineach droplet and by the time constraint on crystal formation that arose by the rapidevaporation of the small droplets. Confinement led to entrapment into metastable phases,evident by the presence of unusual eight-sided and rectangular crystals. QC 20130109 </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of the interface instability that develops at the boundary between a shell of elastic–plastic material and a cylindrical core of confined gas during the inbound implosive motion generated by a shock-wave. The main instability in this configuration is the so-called Richtmyer–Meshkov instability that arises when the shock wave crosses the material interface. Secondary instabilities, such as Rayleigh–Taylor, due to the acceleration of the interface, and Kelvin–Helmholtz, due to slip between solid and fluid, arise as the motion progresses. The reflection of the shock wave at the axis and its second interaction with the material interface as the shock moves outbound, commonly known as re-shock, results in a second Richtmyer–Meshkov instability that potentially increases {{the growth rate of}} interface perturbations, resulting in the formation of a mixing zone typical of fluid–fluid configurations and the loss of the initial perturbation length scales. The study of this problem is of interest for achieving <b>stable</b> inertial <b>confinement</b> fusion reactions but its complexity and the material conditions produced by the implosion close to the axis prove to be challenging for both experimental and numerical approaches. In this paper, we attempt to circumvent some of the difficulties associated with a classical numerical treatment of this problem, such as element inversion in Lagrangian methods or failure to maintain the relationship between the determinant of the deformation tensor and the density in Eulerian approaches, and to provide a description of the different events that occur during the motion of the interface. For this purpose, a multi-material numerical solver for evolving in time the equations of motion for solid and fluid media in an Eulerian formalism has been implemented in a Cartesian grid. Equations of state are derived using thermodynamically consistent hyperelastic relations between internal energy and stresses. The resolution required for capturing the state of solid and fluid materials close to the origin is achieved by making use of adaptive mesh refinement techniques. Rigid-body rotations contained in the deformation tensor have been shown to {{have a negative effect on}} the accuracy of the method in extreme compression conditions and are removed by transforming the deformation tensor into a stretch tensor at each time step. With this methodology, the evolution of the interface can be tracked up to a point at which numerical convergence cannot be achieved due to the inception of numerical Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities caused by slip between materials. From that point, only qualitative conclusions can be extracted from this analysis. The influence of different geometrical parameters, initial conditions, and material properties on the motion of the interface are investigated. Some major differences are found with respect to the better understood fluid–fluid case. For example, increasing the wave number of the interface perturbations leads to a second phase reversal of the interface (i. e., the first phase reversal of the interface naturally occurs due to the initial negative growth-rate of the instability as the shock wave transitions from the high-density material to the low-density one). This phenomenon is caused by the compressive effect of the converging geometry and the low density of the gas with respect to the solid, which allows for the formation of an incipient spike in the center of an already existing bubble. Multiple solid–gas density ratios are also considered. Results show that the motion of the interface asymptotically converges to the solid–vacuum case. When a higher initial density for the gas is considered, the growth rate of interface perturbations decreases and, in some situations, its sign may reverse, as the fluid becomes more dense than the solid due to having higher compressibility. Finally, the influence of the Mach number of the driving shock and the yield stress on the mixing-zone is examined. We find that the width of the mixing zone produced after the re-shock increases in proportion to the strength of the incident shock. An increased yield stress in the solid material makes the interface less unstable due to vorticity being carried away from the interface by shear waves and limits the generation of smaller length scales after the re-shock...|$|R

It is shown that the existence of the adiabatic confinement zones strongly depends on the seasonal inclination of the Earth’s rotation axis. As a result the northern cusp confinement zone appears only in a summer solstice and similarly the southern cusp capture zone appears only in a winter solstice.
