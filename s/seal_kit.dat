5000|$|The {{parts of}} the {{hydraulic}} cylinder that are distorted ( [...] piston rod, rod seal, piston seal and/ or head of rod), need to be either repaired or completely replaced with new parts. The seals can be repacked {{with the help of}} a hydraulic cylinder <b>seal</b> <b>kit.</b> These kits will have seals and suitable o-rings. Remember the size and type of old seal while removing them and fix the new ones accordingly. Make sure that you handle the new seals with utmost care so that they do not get damaged in any way.|$|E
40|$|Air Liquide has {{developed}} a novel inerted UV technology for the curing of coatings using UV irradiations under oxygen-free atmosphere. This technology consists in adapting a Gas <b>Seal</b> <b>Kit</b> to a standard UV-dryer allowing to cure under any desired stable residual oxygen concentration down to 30 ppm using a very moderate flow of nitrogen even at web speed up to 300 m/min. It can be easily implemented to existing printing or laminating lines and allows curing speed increase, UV specific power reduction, coating quality improvement and use of coatings in compliance with indirect food contact regulation...|$|E
50|$|These airguns were {{manufactured}} from 1970 to 1978. They {{are single}} shot pistols, requiring manual reloading after each shot. Velocity is adjustable and some early models allow for trigger travel adjustment. The {{value of these}} guns has held remarkably well, with pristine models (with original box, S&W pellets and S&W CO2 cartridges) selling for multiples of the original price. <b>Seal</b> <b>kits</b> are still widely available so they remain serviceable shooters even today.|$|R
5000|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, Marzocchi were {{original}} equipment manufacturers ('OEM') {{for a number}} of Italian motorcycle marques including Moto Morini and Ducati, their oil shock absorbers also being OEM for Triumph Motorcycles in the latter stages of their production at the Meriden plant. Their later 'Strada' model introduced a degree of air suspension to motorcycling and, like the oil shocks, were available as aftermarket fittings for a large number of models. Strada units were OEM for Triumph's T140LE Royal Wedding and TSS models. A big advantage of the Marzocchi shock was its ability to be rebuilt, <b>seal</b> <b>kits</b> and service manuals being readily available. Meriden also experimented with using Marzocchi front forks which were also used on some Italian models. Meriden however closed down before any such forks reached production models.|$|R

40|$|Background: In 2000, Ringertz et al {{described}} {{the first case}} of systemic anthrax caused by injecting heroin contaminated with anthrax. In 2008, there were 574 drug related deaths in Scotland, of which 336 were associated with heroin and or morphine. We report a rare case of septicaemic anthrax caused by injecting heroin contaminated with anthrax in Scotland. Case Presentation: A 32 year old intravenous drug user (IVDU), presented with a 12 hour history of increasing purulent discharge from a chronic sinus in his left groin. He had a tachycardia, pyrexia, leukocytosis and an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). He was treated with Vancomycin, Clindamycin, Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin and Metronidazole. Blood cultures grew Bacillus anthracis within 24 hours of presentation. He had a computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) of his abdomen, pelvis and thighs performed. These showed inflammatory change relating to the iliopsoas and an area of necrosis in the adductor magnus. He underwent an exploration of his left thigh. This revealed chronically indurated subcutaneous tissues with {{no evidence of a}} collection or necrotic muscle. Treatment with Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin and Clindamycin continued for 14 days. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) device was applied utilising the Venturi ™ wound <b>sealing</b> <b>kit.</b> Following 4 weeks of treatment, the wound dimensions had reduced by 77 %...|$|R

Conclusions Although systemic anthrax infection is rare, it should be considered when faced with severe cutaneous infection in IVDU patients. This case shows that patients with significant bacteraemia may present with no signs of haemodynamic compromise. Prompt recognition and treatment with high dose IV antimicrobial therapy increases the likelihood of survival. The use of simple wound therapy adjuncts such as NPWT can give excellent wound healing results. </p...|$|R
