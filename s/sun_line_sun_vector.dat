50|$|Bremerhaven was {{launched}} on April 2, 1960 for Bremen-Helgoland ferry route under {{the ownership of}} Argo Reederei. In 1965 Bremerhaven partially sank in shallow waters, subsequently being raised and made seaworthy. However, her original owners placed her on the market, selling her to the <b>Sun</b> <b>Lines</b> in 1965. <b>Sun</b> <b>Lines</b> had the newly renamed Stella Maris II heavily rebuilt, changing her superstructure practically entirely and replacing her tall, slim funnel that was placed amidships with a wider, shorter funnel placed aft. Throughout her long career with <b>Sun</b> <b>Lines</b> Stella Maris II served in the Mediterranean, Caribbean and Amazon. In 1996 <b>Sun</b> <b>Lines</b> merged with the Epirotiki. After more than 30 years of service with <b>Sun</b> <b>Lines</b> Stella Maris II was sold to Viking Cruises in 1998. Under this new ownership she became the Viking Bordeaux. She operated under this name until 2004 when she was laid up. During her lay up in the Netherlands the ship was renamed Bordeaux. Shortly thereafter the ship was purchased by Indian Ocean Cruises, who expensively refitted and renamed her the Madagascar. After a very short amount of cruises from Durban this new venture failed as she was not fit for the rough waters of the area. Madagascar was docked in Durban uneventfully for three years. She was then purchased to become the Razzmatazz of Razzmatazz Ocean Cruises. This venture fell through, and the ship was towed to scrapyards at Alang in India and broken up in August 2008.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the digital sun sensor under {{development at the}} University of Naples. The sensor optical head exploits a CMOS photodetector and a mask with multiple holes. This original design allows forming multiple simultaneous images of the sun on the focal plane, which, once processed, produce multiple measurements of the <b>sun</b> <b>line</b> orientation. These are then averaged to improve sensor precision. To achieve high accuracy in <b>sun</b> <b>line</b> determination a calibration function based on neural networks is developed. The sensor can be operated either with a fixed number or with a variable number of sun spots, depending on the required field of view and sun-line measurement precision. This improves sensor flexibility and operation range but, at the same time, increases the computational load when multiple spots are used. Specific techniques are developed to minimize the computational load needed to process multiple acquisitions and to extract the <b>sun</b> <b>line</b> orientation with high accuracy and precision, and adequate updating frequency. These techniques have been tested by extensive test campaigns, carried out by using a laboratory test facility reproducing sun spectrum, apparent size and distance, and variable illumination directions. Specifically, tests reproducing the in-orbit planned experiment profile {{in terms of a}} sequence of <b>sun</b> <b>line</b> orientations are performed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} current {{developments of}} the attitude determination algorithm for Del¦-n 3 Xt, TU Delft next nanosatellite. Several novel quaternion ¦lters using <b>Sun</b> <b>vector</b> and Earth magnetic ¦eld measure-ments and rate gyro outputs are presented. The quaternion measure-ment matrix associated with each line-of-sight measurement is shown to be rank de¦cient. This property is exploited in order to design re-duced order measurement update stages in the ¦lters. The measurement model reduction is designed such as to preserve the statistical informa-tion. The ¦lter covariance propagation can cope rigorously with the multiplicative process noises. The paper also describes {{the development of the}} <b>Sun</b> <b>vector</b> determination algorithm, which merges the outputs of 6 body-mounted four-quadrant Sun sensors. For each sensor, a sim-ple algorithm allows <b>Sun</b> <b>vector</b> determination while avoiding the use of uncertain physical parameters. This algorithm takes into account geometrical imperfections linked to manufacturing limitations. A thor-ough error analysis of the photodiodes measurement outputs is carried out. A spacecraft <b>Sun</b> <b>vector</b> determination algorithm is proposed and illustrated, in the absence of Earth albedo e¨ect, via Monte-Carlo simu-lations and experimental validation. In addition, extensive Monte-Carlo simulations illustrate the good performances of the quaternion ¦lters us-ing spacecraft <b>Sun</b> <b>vector</b> and Earth magnetic ¦eld measurements. The novel reduced ¦lter shows good performances in a challenging tumbling dynamics environment, where a standard additive Kalman ¦lter fails to converge. ...|$|R

2500|$|Many {{researchers}} believe that the Electra ran out of fuel while searching for Howland Island and that Earhart and Noonan ditched at sea. The plane would have carried enough fuel to reach Howland with some extra to spare. The extra fuel would cover some contingencies such as headwinds and searching for Howland. The plane could fly a compass course toward Howland through the night. In the morning, the time of apparent sunrise would allow the plane to determine its <b>line</b> of position (a <b>sun</b> <b>line</b> that ran 157–337). From that line, the plane could determine how much further it must travel before reaching a parallel <b>sun</b> <b>line</b> that ran through Howland. At 6:14 AM Itasca time, Earhart estimated they were 200 miles away from Howland. As the plane closed with Howland, it {{expected to be in}} radio contact with Itasca. With the radio contact, the plane should be able to use radio direction finding (RDF) to head directly for the Itasca and Howland. Unfortunately, the plane was not receiving a radio signal from Itasca, so it would be unable to determine an RDF bearing to the ship. Although Itasca was receiving HF radio signals from the plane, it did not have HF RDF equipment, so it could not determine a bearing to the plane. The communications going to the plane were almost non-existent. Consequently, the plane was not directed to Howland; it was left on its own with little fuel. Presumably, the plane reached the parallel <b>sun</b> <b>line</b> and started searching for Howland on that line of position. At 7:42 AM, Earhart reported, [...] "We must be on you, but cannot see you – but gas is running low. Have been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet." [...] At 8:43 AM, Earhart reported, [...] "We are on the line 157 337. We will repeat this message. We will repeat this on 6210 kilocycles. Wait." ...|$|R

This paper describes the effort to develop a backup control mode, known as Observing II, {{that will allow the}} MAP science mission to continue {{in the event of a}} failure of one of its three reaction wheel assemblies.

In this system, existing thruster-based control modes are used to establish a momentum bias about the <b>sun</b> <b>line</b> sufficient to spin the spacecraft up to the desired scan rate. Natural spacecraft dynamics exhibits spin and nutation similar to the nominal MAP science mode with different relative rotation rates, so the two reaction wheels are used to establish and maintain the desired nutation angle from the <b>sun</b> <b>line.</b> Detailed descriptions of the ObservingII control algorithm and simulation results will be presented, along with the operational considerations of performing the rest of MAP's necessary functions with only two wheels...|$|R

40|$|An angular {{momentum}} desaturation method for momentum exchange devices of orbiting spacecraft is described. The specific {{application of the}} method is to the Skylab which contains three double-gimbaled control moment gyros for precise attitude control and maneuvering. It is assumed that the attitude reference is inertially fixed and {{that two of the}} vehicle principal moments of inertia are much larger than the third. Gravity gradient torques and resultant {{angular momentum}} accumulation are developed for small deviations from the reference. The assumed moment-of-inertia distribution allows desaturation about all axes with only two attitude angles each for the two axes with large moments of inertia. The necessary desaturation maneuvers can be decoupled for a special set of orbital coordinates. All maneuvers are made during the night portion of the orbit, and the percentage utilized for desaturation is selectable. Expressions for the attitude angle commands are developed assuming infinite vehicle rates. The effect of finite rates introduces an efficiency into the desaturation. Expressions for this efficiency are developed and means for compensation are treated. Arbitrary misalignments between geometric vehicle axes and principal moment-of-inertia axes are permissible. An angle bias about the <b>sun</b> <b>line</b> minimizes the angular momentum accumulation about the <b>sun</b> <b>line</b> projection into the orbital plane.
