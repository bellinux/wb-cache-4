5|$|American singer Madonna has {{released}} thirteen studio albums, three soundtrack albums, five live albums, six compilation albums, and thirty-four other limited releases. In 1982, Madonna signed a recording contract with Sire Records, a label owned by Warner Bros. Records. The first release under the label was her self-titled debut album, Madonna (1983). It peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200 and was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). <b>She</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> debut album with the sophomore release, Like a Virgin (1984).

In 1987, she released two albums that reached platinum status in the United States: the Who's That Girl soundtrack and her first remix compilation, You Can Dance. Madonna's fourth studio album, Like a Prayer (1989), became her third number-one album on the Billboard 200, achieving quadruple platinum in US.|$|E
5|$|Charles' illness {{created a}} power vacuum that {{eventually}} led to the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War between supporters of his brother, Louis of Orléans and the royal dukes of Burgundy. Isabeau shifted allegiances as she chose the most favorable paths for the heir to the throne. When <b>she</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> Armagnacs, the Burgundians accused her of adultery with Louis of Orléans; when she sided with the Burgundians the Armagnacs removed her from Paris and she was imprisoned. In 1407 John the Fearless assassinated Orléans, sparking hostilities between the factions. The war ended soon after Isabeau's eldest son, Charles, had John the Fearless assassinated in 1419—an act that saw him disinherited. Isabeau attended the 1420 signing of the Treaty of Troyes, which decided that the English king should inherit the French crown after the death of her husband, Charles VI. She lived in English-occupied Paris until her death in 1435.|$|E

500|$|Tripoli was {{the first}} modern torpedo cruiser built by the Regia Marina; <b>she</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> earlier cruiser , which had been a failed design that did not see much use.

500|$|On 14 October, {{the ship}} went to Philadelphia for an {{overhaul}} that lasted until 20 February 1915. She thereafter steamed to Cuba for the routine peacetime training maneuvers.

500|$|After her {{suspension}} with Warner Bros. was lifted, Baker {{appeared in}} William Wyler's Western epic The Big Country (1958). The film was well received by critics, though the shoot {{was described as}} [...] "problematic": Baker was four months pregnant {{at the time and}} had to wear restraining garments, and director Wyler reportedly had her {{on the verge of tears}} after forcing her to repeat the same take over 60 times, only to use the first one. <b>She</b> <b>followed</b> <b>The</b> Big Country with lead roles in two romances, portraying a nun in The Miracle (1959) co-starring Roger Moore, and in But Not for Me (1959), a comedy with Clark Gable. The New York Times praised Baker's performance in But Not for Me, saying: [...] "Miss Baker, being a young lady who not only has looks but also can act, makes you understand why Mr. Gable would like to cheat a little bit on Father Time." [...] She disliked The Miracle so much that she bought out her contract with Warner Bros., putting her in considerable debt. But Not for Me was made at Paramount.|$|E

500|$|According to African-American {{literature}} scholar Pierre A. Walker, {{the challenge}} {{for much of the}} history of African-American literature was that its authors have had to confirm its status as literature before they could accomplish their political goals, which was why Angelou's editor Robert Loomis was able to dare her into writing Caged Bird by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered [...] "high art". [...] Angelou acknowledged that <b>she</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> slave narrative tradition of [...] "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'". [...] Scholar John McWhorter calls Angelou's books [...] "tracts" [...] that defend African-American culture and fight negative stereotypes. [...] According to McWhorter, Angelou structured her books, which to him seem to be written more for children than for adults, to support her defense of black culture. [...] McWhorter sees Angelou as she depicts herself in her autobiographies [...] "as a kind of stand-in figure for the black American in Troubled Times". [...] McWhorter views Angelou's works as dated, but recognizes that [...] "she has helped {{to pave the way for}} contemporary black writers who are able to enjoy the luxury of being merely individuals, no longer representatives of the race, only themselves". [...] Scholar Lynn Z. Bloom compares Angelou's works to the writings of Frederick Douglass, stating that both fulfilled the same purpose: to describe black culture and to interpret it for their wider, white audiences.|$|E
