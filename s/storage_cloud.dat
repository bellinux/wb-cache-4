40|$|ABSTRACT: Cloud {{computing}} {{is the use}} of Internet for {{the tasks}} performed on the local computer, with the hardware and software demands maintained elsewhere. It represents a different way to architect and remotely manage various computing resources. Cloud is widely used everywhere owing to its convenience, be it in simple data analytic program or composite web or mobile applications. Cloud computing is being driven by many which includes Amazon, Google and Yahoo as well as traditional vendors including IBM, Microsoft and Intel. The data should be available in the cloud for it to be accessed by many users. There are four main types of cloud storage- Multi <b>Cloud</b> <b>Storage</b> or distributed <b>cloud</b> <b>storage,</b> Public <b>Cloud</b> <b>Storage,</b> Private <b>Cloud</b> <b>Storage,</b> Mobile <b>Cloud</b> <b>Storage.</b> Distributed <b>cloud</b> is a combination of public and private <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> where some critical data resides in the enterprise's private cloud while other data is stored and accessible from a public <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> provider. Provable data possession (PDP) is a technique for ensuring the integrity of data stored in storage outsourcing. In this paper, we propose a method called cooperative PDP (CPDP) scheme based on homomorphic verifiable response and hash index hierarchy. INDEX TERMS: Cloud, Hash index, Integrity, PDP. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- A <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> gateway is {{a network}} {{appliance}} or server which resides at the customer premises. It can integrate and translate different <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> APIs and increase data security. A variety of designs of <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> gateway have been proposed. However, existing designs cannot help users to access data stored on the <b>cloud</b> when <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> cannot be reached due to maintenance, interruptions or other failures. In this paper, {{we present a}} design of <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> gateway based on data dispersal. In the <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> gateway of our design, data is divided into redundant data blocks and parity blocks, and these blocks are stored into different <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> respectively. When a portion of <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> cannot be accessed, the new designed <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> gateway still able to access the required data by restoring data from other available <b>cloud</b> <b>storage.</b> Further, if an acceptable number of data blocks are lost or erroneous, the <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> gateway of our design can also restore the original data. And the gateway utilizes an improved LRU to improve the efficiency of cache. Experimental {{results show that the}} <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> gateway of our design can restore the original data when some <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> fail and improves the access efficiency by 20 %.

50|$|A {{cooperative}} <b>storage</b> <b>cloud</b> is a decentralized {{model of}} networked online storage where data is stored on multiple computers (nodes), {{hosted by the}} participants cooperating in the cloud. For the cooperative scheme to be viable, the total storage contributed in aggregate {{must be at least}} equal to the amount of storage needed by end users. However, some nodes may contribute less storage and some may contribute more. There may be reward models to compensate the nodes contributing more.|$|E
50|$|Cloud Dataproc is a Platform as {{a service}} (PaaS) product {{designed}} to combine the Spark and Hadoop frameworks with many common cloud computing patterns. Cloud Dataproc separate compute and storage, which is a relatively common design for many cloud Hadoop offerings. Cloud Dataproc utilizes Google Compute Engine virtual machines for compute and Google Cloud Storage for file <b>storage.</b> <b>Cloud</b> Dataproc has a set of control and integration mechanisms that coordinate the lifecycle, management, and coordination of clusters.

50|$|Unlike a {{traditional}} <b>storage</b> <b>cloud,</b> a cooperative {{does not directly}} employ dedicated servers for the actual storage of the data, thereby {{eliminating the need for}} a significant dedicated hardware investment. Each node in the cooperative runs specialized software which communicates with a centralized control and orchestration server, thereby allowing the node to both consume and contribute storage space to the cloud. The centralized control and orchestration server requires several orders of magnitude less resources (storage, computing power, and bandwidth) to operate, relative to the overall capacity of the cooperative.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{traditional}} service {{model of}} <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> {{is that the}} service providers supply both the storage capacities and data storage services through the Internet to the clients. The obvious disadvantage of this model is that the data of the same customer stored in multiple <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> providers can not interact with each other. This paper adds a new layer to this model. The new model consists of StaS (Storage as a Service) User, StaS Provider and <b>Cloud</b> <b>Storage</b> Provider, which can solve the above problem. It also possesses some other advantages, such as <b>Cloud</b> <b>Storage</b> Providers need not care about the market and how customers use their services, different customers can use the <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> services in different security levels as they need.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Cloud</b> <b>storage</b> {{services}} {{have become increasingly}} popular. Because {{of the importance of}} privacy, many <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> encryption schemes have been proposed to protect data from those who do not have access. All such schemes assumed that <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> providers are safe and cannot be hacked; however, in practice, some authorities (i. e., coercers) may force <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> providers to reveal user secrets or confidential data on the cloud, thus altogether circumventing storage encryption schemes. In this paper, we present our design for a new <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> encryption scheme that enables <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> providers to create convincing fake user secrets to protect user privacy. Since coercers cannot tell if obtained secrets are true or not, the <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> provider ensure that user privacy is still securely protected...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Cloud {{computing}} is {{a general}} term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the Internet. Instead of running programs and data on an individual desktop computer, everything is hosted in the “cloud”. It offers {{a major change in}} how to store information and run applications. One of the primary uses of cloud computing is for data <b>storage.</b> With <b>cloud</b> <b>storage,</b> data is stored on multiple third-party servers, rather than on the dedicated servers used in traditional distributed data <b>storage.</b> In <b>cloud</b> <b>storage,</b> the user sees a virtual server; it appears as if the data is stored in a particular place with a specific name. But that place doesn’t exist in reality. It’s just to reference a virtual space in the cloud.
