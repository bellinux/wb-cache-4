5|$|As a prisoner, he battled starvation, {{receiving}} {{only a small}} meal of mush {{served in}} a tin cup—a utensil he kept {{for the rest of}} his life. With a weight below , Buckles developed beriberi, and led fellow captives in calisthenics to counter the effects of imprisonment. Their captors showed little mercy, but Buckles was allowed to grow a <b>small</b> <b>garden,</b> which he often used to help feed children who were imprisoned there.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{on the site of}} the prison houses Southwark Council's John Harvard Library and Local Studies Library, at 211 Borough High Street, just north of the junction with Tabard Street. All that remains of the Marshalsea is the brick wall that marked the southern boundary of the prison, separating it from St George's churchyard, now a <b>small</b> <b>garden.</b> It can be reached by underground on the Northern line to Borough tube station, or by train to London Bridge station.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} {{surrounded}} by a deer park which was landscaped by Capability Brown from 1775. He established a winding path, known as Capability Brown path, through the park and planted deciduous trees in key places to frame the house and castle. The deer park contains notable herds of rare White Park cattle and fallow deer. A <b>small</b> <b>garden</b> behind the house, overlooking the deer park, Moorish in style with a central fountain, has been restored to its former glory. Brown's beech clumps survive in the present day.|$|E

5|$|Their {{first house}} burned, {{and the family}} lost its possessions. They {{moved to a new}} house {{on the other side of}} town on Rose Street, which Williams' mother soon turned into a {{boarding}} house. The house had a <b>small</b> <b>garden,</b> on which they grew diverse crops that Williams and his sister Irene sold around Georgiana. At a chance meeting in Georgiana, Hank Williams met U.S. Representative J. Lister Hill while he was campaigning across Alabama. Williams told Hill that his mother was interested to talk with him about his problems and her need to collect Elonzo Williams' disability pension. With Hill's help, the family began collecting the money. Despite his medical condition, the family managed fairly well financially throughout the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} of the church there are the {{remnants}} of a stone preaching cross. The cross was originally situated on Poulton's boundary and marked a resting place for mourners travelling long distances to bury corpses at St Chad's. Only the two circular steps into which the original structure was set remain; the cross shaft has been replaced by an octagonal pillar. The pillar was used as a sundial until the early 20th century when the gnomon was stolen. The steps function as a memorial for present-day mourners at St Chad's, in a <b>small</b> <b>garden</b> of remembrance. The churchyard is noted locally for its display of crocuses and other flowering bulbs in early springtime.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August, the Half Flight was {{augmented}} by four Martinsyde S1s and redesignated No.30 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps (RFC). The squadron moved into Kut following the city's capture by the Allies during the Battle of Es Sinn in September; {{for his part}} in the operation, Petre was again mentioned in despatches. Over the following two months, however, both Treloar and White were captured and became prisoners of war, leaving Petre as the only pilot remaining from the original Half Flight. Around the time of the Battle of Ctesiphon in November, he devised an implement shaped like a <b>small</b> <b>garden</b> rake that allowed him to accurately measure ground distances from the air in order to better map the desert terrain. During the Siege of Kut between December 1915 and April 1916, he flew a series of missions using crude parachutes to airdrop grain supplies (and a millstone for grinding), medical supplies and equipment to the town's entrapped garrison, which included nine of his AFC mechanics.|$|E

25|$|Its <b>small</b> <b>garden</b> was tended by Marie Antoinette {{when she}} spent her summers in the city. Napoleon {{used it as a}} holiday home during his period in power. The château has been {{designated}} as a French historical monument and holds a collection of tapestries.|$|E
25|$|Hal's {{interest}} in agriculture began early. He started raising truck in a <b>small</b> <b>garden</b> in Arden, {{and sold it}} around the countryside. His keen sense of beauty showed {{in the way he}} fixed up his boxes of vegetables to sell, arranging them artistically in green boxes.|$|E

25|$|Minor changes however {{were done}} {{as early as}} from 1740 onwards: besides various changes in the interior, a large garden was added in the {{northern}} part of the site and Emperor Francis I (Maria Theresa's husband, who was interested in botany) created a <b>small</b> <b>garden</b> to the east of the castle building. The chief designer until 1757 was J. B. Martinelli.|$|E
25|$|At {{the bend}} in Willowbrook, the {{driveway}} continues straight, curving around slightly downhill behind some large mature deciduous shade trees. The house is to its west, {{built into the}} gentle slope. The basement is thus exposed on the west (rear) elevation. On the southwest a <b>small</b> <b>garden</b> has been added by the current owners; it is considered a non-contributing resource to the National Register listing.|$|E
25|$|B.xylothemelia {{is rarely}} cultivated. It prefers {{lateritic}} and other heavy soils, and tolerates dry conditions and moderate frosts once established. Tony Cavanagh and Margaret Pieroni {{suggest that it}} would be best suited to a <b>small</b> <b>garden</b> in a warm sunny area. Seed takes six to seven weeks to germinate; germination rates appear to be quite low, with most reports suggesting success rates of less than 30%.|$|E

5000|$|Small tilling equipment, used in <b>small</b> <b>gardens</b> such as {{household}} <b>gardens</b> and <b>small</b> commercial <b>gardens,</b> {{can provide}} both {{primary and secondary}} tillage. For example, a rotary tiller does both the [...] "plowing" [...] and the [...] "harrowing", preparing a smooth, loose seedbed. It does not provide the row-wise weed control that cultivator teeth would. For that task, there are single-person-pushable toothed cultivators.|$|R

25|$|On August 24, 2009, {{the iconic}} Largo Clock Tower, which was {{constructed}} shortly {{after completion of}} Largo Central Park, was demolished. City officials made the change because of the tower's decay and because a deteriorating landmark at a busy intersection is not an uplifting and memorable sight. The area surrounding the clock tower was replaced with a <b>small</b> <b>garden</b> area, in order to incorporate the area into Largo Central Park.|$|E
25|$|Another story, {{often told}} to tourists, {{tells of a}} wealthy {{merchant}} who, {{during a visit to}} the city with his family, had his beloved young son go missing. The merchant hastily formed a search party, which scoured all corners of the city, until the boy was found happily urinating in a <b>small</b> <b>garden.</b> The merchant, as a gift of gratitude to the locals who helped out during the search, had the fountain built.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} little known in cultivation. It germinates well, but is {{difficult}} to establish and slow to grow. It has been grown successfully in loamy soil in northern Victoria, but attempts to grow it in the sandy soils of Perth have failed. Tony Cavanagh and Margaret Pieroni suggest that as a compact shrub with attractive foliage {{it would be best}} suited to a <b>small</b> <b>garden.</b> It requires warm, dry weather with near full sun, and heavy well drained soils. It is hardy to drought and frost.|$|E
