5|$|Helmets made {{entirely of}} bronze were also used, {{while some of}} them had large cheek guards, {{probably}} stitched or riveted to the helmet, as well as an upper pierced knot to hold a crest. <b>Small</b> <b>holes</b> all around the cheek guards and the helmet's lower edge were used for the attachment of internal padding. Other types of bronze helmets were also used. During the late Mycenaean period, additional types were also used such as horned helmets made of strips of leather.|$|E
5|$|Since a {{partially}} filled ballonet would cause longitudinal instability, {{due to the}} mass of air rolling fore or aft {{in the direction of}} pitch, two cloth partitions were used to divide the ballonet into three separate compartments; <b>small</b> <b>holes</b> in the partitions allowed the air to permeate gradually throughout the ballonet without affecting the stability of the airship.|$|E

Instead, the modules were arranged in groups surrounding the target chamber in a compact arrangement. In baseline designs, the modules were stacked in 2-wide by 8-high groups in two rings {{above and below the}} target chamber, shining their light through <b>small</b> <b>holes</b> drilled into the chamber to protect them from the neutron flux coming back out.|$|E

40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>hole</b> {{accelerator}} grid ion optical {{systems have been}} tested as a possible means of improving 30 -cm ion thruster performance. The effects of <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> grids on the critical aspects of thruster operation including discharge chamber performance, doubly-charged ion concentration, effluent beam characteristics, and plasma properties have been evaluated. In general, <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> {{accelerator grid}}s are beneficial in improving thruster performance while maintaining low double ion ratios. However, extremely small accelerator aperture diameters tend to degrade beam divergence characteristics. A quantitative discussion of these {{advantages and disadvantages of}} <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> accelerator grids, as well as resulting variations in thruster operation characteristics, is presented...|$|R

5|$|Plastromancy: The {{earliest}} use of turtle shells {{comes from}} the archaeological site in Jiahu site. The shells, containing small pebbles of various size, colour and quantity, were drilled with <b>small</b> <b>holes,</b> suggesting that each pair of them was tied together originally. Similar finds have also {{been found in the}} Dawenkou burial sites of about 4000–3000 BC, as well as in Henan, Sichuan, Jiangsu and Shaanxi. The turtle-shell shakers for the most part are made of the shell of land turtles, identified as Cuora flavomarginata. Archaeologists believe that these shells were used either as rattles in ceremonial dances, shamantic healing tools or ritual paraphernalia for divinational purposes.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous <b>small</b> <b>holes</b> present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E

5|$|Primarily nocturnal, nursehounds {{spend the}} day inside <b>small</b> <b>holes</b> in rocks and swim into deeper water at night to hunt. Sometimes two sharks will squeeze into the same hole, and several {{individuals}} will seek out refuges within the same local area. In one tracking study, a single immature nursehound was observed to use five different refuges in succession {{over a period of}} 168 days, consistently returning to each one over a number of days before moving on. Nursehounds may occupy refuges to hide from predators, avoid harassment by mature conspecifics, and/or to facilitate thermoregulation. In captivity, these sharks are gregarious and tend to rest in groups, though the individuals comprising any particular group changes frequently. This species is less common than the small-spotted catshark.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{nutrient}} deficiencies {{can cause}} a variety of plant problems that range from malformed plants {{to a lack of}} head growth. Many insects are attracted to lettuce, including cutworms, which cut seedlings off at the soil line; wireworms and nematodes, which cause yellow, stunted plants; tarnished plant bugs and aphids, which cause yellow, distorted leaves; leafhoppers, which cause stunted growth and pale leaves; thrips, which turn leaves gray-green or silver; leafminers, which create tunnels within the leaves; flea beetles, which cut <b>small</b> <b>holes</b> in leaves and caterpillars, slugs and snails, which cut large holes in leaves. Mammals, including rabbits and groundhogs, also eat the plants. Lettuce contains several defensive compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones, and other natural phenolics such as flavonol and glycosides, which help to protect it against pests. Certain varieties contain more than others, and some selective breeding and genetic modification studies have focused on using this trait to identify and produce commercial varieties with increased pest resistance.|$|E
5|$|The holotype of S. angustirostris is a {{skull and}} postcrania, so the cranium {{of the species}} is well-described. Bell et al. re-evaluated the entire species in a 2011 {{publication}} with Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. Their description found the skull to be generalized among hadrosaurines, and are much larger than any skulls of S. osborni. The most unusual feature for a hadrosaurine is the long, protruding, solid crest that extends upwards diagonally {{from the back of}} the skull roof. Unlike lambeosaurines, the crests are made up completely of the nasal bone. The premaxilla bones make up almost 50% of the entire skull length, and both sides are filled with <b>small</b> <b>holes.</b> Only in adult individuals has the front of the premaxillary contact been fused. Longer than the premaxilla, the nasal bones are the longest in the skull. They make up the entire length of the crest, and are never preserved as fused.|$|E

5|$|Although accurate, shadow clocks {{relied on}} the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather. The Egyptians {{therefore}} developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor. There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with <b>small</b> <b>holes</b> in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings {{on the side of}} the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt. Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using plumb-lines called merkhets. In use since at least 600, two of these instruments were aligned with Polaris, the north pole star, to create a north–south meridian. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets.|$|E
5|$|Course {{officials}} resumed work by drilling shafts {{into the}} surface to form a well and installed a cap on it {{in an attempt to}} reduce the drainage problem before the start of Friday's scheduled sessions. It was mooted by some British press publications that the race would be moved to the track's infield road course but this could not be achieved because the circuit did not hold a licence from motorsport's world governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, to hold an event on this section, and the teams did not bring a suitable aerodynamic package. Drainage problems continued to affect the track leading to the cancellation of the qualifying session, and the starting order was determined by the drivers order in the points' standings. The pole position was awarded to Bräck, his sixth of the season. He was joined on the grid's front row by de Ferran. Andretti was third, Castroneves fourth and Dixon fifth. Dario Franchitti, Patrick Carpentier, Cristiano da Matta, Roberto Moreno and Tony Kanaan rounded out the top ten. Drying efforts continued overnight with additional equipment and extra workers from across England brought in to help improve the track's drainage. Five jet dryers were taken onto the track with additional fuel transported from Sywell Aerodrome to help the vehicles carry out their operation. Additionally, thousands of <b>small</b> <b>holes</b> were created in the track's surface to release moisture.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A new EDM {{method of}} <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> is {{presented}} in which critical size of EDM drilling can be reduced {{less than that of}} limit of primitive EDM system by current dividing. The drilling characters of <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> EDM by means of current dividing based on a principle of discharging-area equalization were studied and discussed. The experimental results show that drilling speed and discharging gap decrease a little, and electrodes wear increases slightly. There is a drilling consistency in EDM ability between single and double electrodes under discharging-area equalization, and new method helps to improve the drilling precision. The research outcomes provide a deeper understanding for a <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> EDM...|$|R
