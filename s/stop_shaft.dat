40|$|A {{new type}} of {{hydrostatic}} and hydrodynamic non-contacting face seals {{has been designed to}} meet the requirements of lower leakage, longer life and more repeatedly start and <b>stop</b> on <b>shaft</b> seals raised by liquid rocket engine turbopumps. And an experimental study on the performance of the face seal in the actual liquid oxygen turbopump was completed where low-viscosity water was selected as the seal fluid for the sake of safety. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Different performances of face seals under preset conditions were obtained by repeatedly running tests, and the main performance parameters encompass leakage, fluid film pressure between the faces, operating power, face temperature, and so on. The results indicate that the designed face seal has a smaller amount of leakage, with a minimum value of 3 ?ml/s. Furthermore, the designed face seal has been proved to demand lower operating power. Since its operating power changes slightly with different sealed fluid pressures, the new seal can be deployed in the harsh working condition with high pressure or with high speed (greater than 20, 000 ?rpm). However, one proviso is that when liquid is employed as the seal fluid, the groove depth should be relatively deeper (greater than 10 ?µm). In response to future engineering requirements, study on the controllable spiral-groove face seals to improve the current design is being conducted. The advancement of such non-contacting face seals proffers important insights to the design of turbo-pump shaft seal in a new generation of liquid rocket engine with regard to the requirement of frequent start and stop as well as long life on it...|$|R

5000|$|It may {{be noted}} from the diagram above {{that no matter}} how [...] "tight" [...] the heel bend, {{reversing}} the stick head over the ball, with a [...] "traditional" [...] style hockey stick head, always requires both a vertical and horizontal adjustment of the stick head position. This is not anywhere near as difficult as it was with the very long head stick and this sort of adjustment will be almost sub-conscious in an experienced player. Note too, that when the shaft is held vertically, the ball is more securely stopped, when on the ground, to the toe side of the shaft rather than {{in the middle of the}} shaft. Novice players frequently assume that the centre of the ball will align with the centre of the <b>shaft</b> when <b>stopping</b> the ball in this way and as a result, the ball deflects off to the heel side and usually into their feet. Because of the heel slope on the stick head the vertical <b>shaft</b> <b>stop</b> is actually much easier to carry out securely (when the ball is on the ground) if the handle is held at least 10° off the vertical, with the top of the handle sloped to the player's left. When the ball in the air, a little off the ground, below knee height for example, is often easier to catch the ball correctly if the handle is vertical.|$|R

40|$|Successful hair {{follicle}} organ {{culture has been}} established for some time, but hair growth in vitro is limited and generally terminates prematurely in comparison with in vivo.

In this investigation, adult rat vibrissa follicles for which growth in culture is limited to about 10 d, were maintained in vitro {{for a minimum of}} 20 d after the hair <b>shaft</b> <b>stopped</b> growing. The pattern of fiber growth and long-term follicle pathology reflected the initial hair cycle stage at the time of isolation. Furthermore, there was evidence that a group of follicles put into culture when in late anagen were attempting to cycle in vitro.

Their viability was confirmed when primary cell cultures were established from isolated dermal tissue. These cells labeled positively for -smooth muscle actin, an established marker of {{hair follicle}} dermal cell phenotype in vitro. Moreover, isolated dermal tissue induced hair growth when implanted into inactivated hair follicles in vivo.

5000|$|After Larry {{is killed}} by his brother, {{who has been}} turned into a Roboman, Ian hides in the mine, {{eventually}} finding Wells again, also seeing Barbara from a distance. Before he can get to her, however, he ends up hiding and being trapped in a capsule filled with explosives. Barbara uses Dortmun's notebook to bluff the Daleks into believing she has information about an imminent uprsing and demands to speak with the Black Dalek. When she and Jenny are brought before it, they discover that the Daleks are drilling through the Earth's crust so that they can blow out its core with a penetrative explosive capsule and then use a guidance system to pilot the planet around space. As the Daleks set the capsule in position and start the countdown, Ian scrambles the wiring inside the capsule, disarming it. When the shaft opens beneath the capsule he escapes, but a Dalek cuts the rope he uses and he tumbles halfway down the <b>shaft,</b> <b>stopping</b> at a small access node. Leaving by the node he jams a cord of wood across the shaft opening, preventing a re-armed explosive capsule from moving further down the shaft. While Barbara creates a diversion spinning a wild story about an uprising involving [...] "the Boston Tea Party," [...] "General Lee's forces" [...] and [...] "Hannibal attacking from the Alps," [...] Jenny tries to corrupt the machine which contols the Robomen and send them new orders. The Daleks catch them and, after rearming the capsule and launching it, trap the two in the control room to be killed in the explosion. The Doctor and Tyler, hiding outside the control room, enter when the Daleks leave and free Barbara and Jenny. Using the Daleks' scanners they find David and Susan, who destroy the radio beacon, leaving the Robomen adrift and causing a temporary overload within the Daleks, who short circuit. Barbara and the Doctor give new orders to the Robomen to destroy the Daleks, and with the help of the Robomen, Wells and Tyler lead the human slaves in rebellion, destroying the inert Daleks and escaping the mine. Ian reunites with his friends, and before the capsule explodes they all escape back up the cliffs to rejoin Susan and David. The bomb destroys the Dalek fleet and causes an entirely new phenomenon — a volcanic eruption in England.|$|R
5000|$|Statistically speaking, cable-borne {{elevators}} {{are extremely}} safe. Their safety record is unsurpassed {{by any other}} vehicle system. In 1998, {{it was estimated that}} approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, {{and the vast majority of}} these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related — for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts, and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors. In fact, prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant — the elevator operator. However, there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children's hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged. This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it is possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happens, the device causes copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the <b>shaft,</b> <b>stopping</b> the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by Elisha Graves Otis. In addition, an oil/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the travel height and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) to somewhat cushion any impact. However, In Thailand, in November 2012, a woman was killed in free falling elevator, in what was reported as the [...] "first legally recognised death caused by a falling lift".|$|R
