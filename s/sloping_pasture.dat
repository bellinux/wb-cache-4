Regression analyses were used to identify site factors and characteristics of the herbaceous vegetation associated with totara regeneration.|$|E

50|$|The {{species is}} endemic to Sicily and the Aegadian Islands, {{though it is}} absent from the northeastern part of Sicily. It frequents areas with lush {{vegetation}} {{on the edges of}} woodland, bushy <b>slopes,</b> <b>pasture</b> and cultivated land. It is often present in gardens, especially irrigated ones. In contrast to the Italian wall lizard it does not climb much and occupies more densely vegetated areas.

40|$|Background and Aims: An {{increase}} {{in a form}} of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, termed fine endophyte or fine root endophyte (Glomus tenue (Greenall) I. R. Hall), is often observed under extreme environmental conditions. We investigated the influence of host plant species, waterlogging and landscape zone (soil type) on colonisation by fine root endophyte. Methods: Colonisation by AM fungi and fine root endophyte was measured in Lolium rigidum Gaudin (ryegrass) and Lotus subbiflorus Lag. (lotus) sampled from the upper, middle and lower/riparian zones of a <b>sloping</b> <b>pasture.</b> Ryegrass and lotus were then grown in a glasshouse in soil from these three zones: waterlogging was initiated for half the pots from day 43 and colonisation determined 35 days later. Results: In the field, AM fungal colonisation was lowest in the lower zone for ryegrass only. In the glasshouse, waterlogging greatly decreased AM fungal colonisation, {{with the exception of}} lotus in lower zone soil where colonisation by fine root endophyte was prolific. Waterlogging impacts on plant growth were small. Conclusions: Fine root endophyte better withstands the stressful conditions induced by waterlogging than other forms of AM fungi, but this response differs with host plant. Further study of the environmental niche of fine root endophyte is necessary to understand its function under extreme conditions...|$|E

40|$|Zerasca is an {{indigenous}} sheep breed in endangered status. That breed carries out a primary {{position in the}} safeguard of Tuscany biodiversity, typical production improvement and agricultural district protection. It {{is characterized by a}} quite big size and a white medium open fleece. The study took on natural rangelands around Zeri in Massa Carrara region, placed in the north part of Tuscany at an altitude of 600 - 1200 m above sea level. Rough countries with self-shown <b>sloping</b> <b>pastures</b> typify that area. The Zerasca positive resistance to adverse climate conditions underlines a fine adaptation to the whole environment. However, common shepherds’ habit is to treat animals twice a year with antiparasitarian drugs, mainly in consequence of the presumed loss of productions. Starting from these observations, we analyzed worm challenge in three Zerasca breeding under natural pasture, through faecal egg count, packed cell volume and classification of parasite species. The identification of animals resistant to gastrointestinal parasitosis and the recognition of relationships between sheeps pointed out the possibilities of evaluating genetic resistance. The purpose is to reduce antihelmintics, drugs’ residual in the soil and pharmacological resistance, so that the treatments limitated to the non-resistance subjects move significant economical and ecological implications in breeding management...|$|R
