5|$|William Booth {{began his}} 'Christian Revival Society' in 1865, preaching the gospel {{in a tent}} erected in the 'Friends Burial Ground', Thomas Street, Whitechapel. Others joined his 'Christian Mission', and on 7 August 1878 the Salvation Army was formed at a meeting held at 272 Whitechapel Road. A statue commemorates both his mission and his work in helping the poor. Dubliner Thomas John Barnardo came to the London Hospital, Whitechapel to train for medical missionary work in China. Soon after his arrival in 1866 a cholera {{epidemic}} swept the East End killing 3,000 people. Many families were left destitute, with thousands of children orphaned and forced to beg or find work in the factories. In 1867, Barnardo set up a Ragged School to provide a basic education but was shown the many children <b>sleeping</b> <b>rough.</b> His first home for boys was established at 18 Stepney Causeway in 1870. When a boy died after being turned away (the home was full), the policy was instituted that 'No Destitute Child Ever Refused Admission'.|$|E

Due to a delay in acceptance, they were then taken to a Mr Grainger and sold for eight guineas.|$|E

After his playing days finished, Fleetwood-Smith succumbed to alcoholism and spent many years homeless {{on the streets of}} Melbourne, sometimes <b>sleeping</b> <b>rough</b> a few hundred metres from the stadium where he played many of his best matches, the Melbourne Cricket Ground. His arrest in 1969 brought attention to his plight and a number of influential people rallied to his cause.|$|E
40|$|<b>Rough</b> <b>sleeping</b> {{in rural}} England {{is a social}} problem denied. This neglect {{reflects}} the more general non-coupling of homelessness and rurality, with idyll-ised notions of rural England informing interpretations of social problems in rural spaces. This article contends that this non-coupling also stems from the inappropriate application of traditional methods for estimating <b>rough</b> <b>sleeping</b> in rural locations. The particular geography of problem recognition that has driven the policy response to <b>rough</b> <b>sleeping</b> is revealed and the insights provided by and challenges raised {{through the application of}} an alternative method of counting <b>rough</b> <b>sleeping</b> sensitive to the rural context are exposed. </p...|$|R

50|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made in reducing <b>rough</b> <b>sleeping</b> in England with the voluntary sector playing a lead role. Some parts of the voluntary sector have chosen to remain outside the collaborative framework that has been created to achieve the reduction. London continues to have the biggest <b>rough</b> <b>sleeping</b> problem with between 250 and 300 individuals sleeping out on any night and almost 3,000 over a year. Nonetheless, this figure compares favourably with <b>rough</b> <b>sleeping</b> figures for other European capitals and is considerably lower than, for example, New York which has a comparable population to London.|$|R
25|$|In 2016, Government figures {{analysed}} by {{the charity}} Shelter revealed that Brighton and Hove {{had the worst}} rate for homelessness outside London and is worse than some boroughs in the capital. Based on the Freedom of Information data there are 4,095 people <b>sleeping</b> <b>rough</b> or in emergency or temporary accommodation in the city, suggesting that one in 69 people in Brighton and Hove was homeless. In a charity report issued in November 2016, three areas in Brighton & Hove, East Brighton, Queen’s Park, and Moulsecoomb & Bevendean {{ranked in the top}} ten per cent nationally for deprivation.|$|E
25|$|The annual {{number of}} {{homeless}} households in England peaked in 2003–04 at 135,420 before falling {{to a low}} of 40,020 in 2009–10. In 2014–15, there were 54,430 homeless households, which was 60 per cent below the 2003–04 peak. The UK has more than 80,000 children in temporary accommodation, a number which increases every year. The official figures for England are that an average of 498 people sleeps rough each night, with 248 of those in London. It {{is important to note that}} many individuals may spend only a few days or weeks <b>sleeping</b> <b>rough,</b> and so this number hides the total number of people actually affected in any one year.|$|E
25|$|When {{each of the}} West {{children}} {{reached the}} age of seven, they were assigned numerous daily chores to perform within their household; all were very seldom allowed to socialise outside the household perimeters unless either Fred or Rose were present, and all had to follow strict guidelines imposed by their parents, with severe punishment—almost always physical—being the penalty for not conforming to the household rules. Each lived in fear of being the recipients of violence from their parents, and although this violence was occasionally inflicted by Fred, the vast majority of this violence was inflicted by Rose for any real or imagined breach of conformity. Occasionally, the violence was irrational, indiscreet or even inflicted for Rose's simple gratification (although Rose would always take great care not to mark the children's faces or hands in these assaults). Both Heather, then her younger brother Stephen (b. 1973), are known to have run away from home, although both children returned to Cromwell Street after several weeks of alternately <b>sleeping</b> <b>rough</b> or staying with friends. Both were beaten when they returned home. Between 1972 and 1992, the West children were admitted to the Accident and Emergency department of local hospitals 31 times; the injuries were explained as accidents and never reported to social services.|$|E

25|$|Kathy and Phil {{eventually}} {{sort out}} their differences, marry, {{and have a}} son, Ben (Matthew Silver), making Phil feel neglected and depressed so he turns to alcohol and develops an addiction. This makes him abusive and neglectful towards Kathy and Ben, so Kathy takes Ben and moves out. Realising what he has lost, Phil gives up alcohol and attends Alcoholics Anonymous, which helps reveal {{the basis of his}} problem – the physical abuse he received from his father and his fear that he may abuse Ben. He and Kathy reconcile when he attends counselling until he begins an affair with fellow alcoholic Lorna Cartwright (Janet Dibley), who starts stalking him. With his marriage in jeopardy, Phil takes Kathy to Paris and admits his affair with Lorna so Kathy throws her wedding ring into the river. Phil begins <b>sleeping</b> <b>rough,</b> gambling, and blaming Kathy for his decline so she decides to leave Walford for South Africa, letting it be known that an offer of reconciliation from Phil would make her reconsider. Phil is undecided until Lorna stops him going after Kathy by locking herself in his bathroom and attempts suicide. He later follows Kathy to the airport but is stopped by Kathy's son, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), who persuades him that Kathy and Ben are better off without him. Phil agonises over the loss of his son.|$|E
500|$|Hannah {{entered a}} period of {{remission}} but, in May 1903, became ill again. Chaplin, then 14, had the task of taking his mother to the infirmary, from where she {{was sent back to}} Cane Hill. He lived alone for several days, searching for food and occasionally <b>sleeping</b> <b>rough,</b> until Sydney – who had enrolled in the Navy two years earlier – returned. Hannah was released from the asylum eight months later, but in March 1905, her illness returned, this time permanently. [...] "There was nothing we could do but accept poor mother's fate", Chaplin later wrote, and she remained in care until her death in 1928.|$|E
500|$|The Historic Royal Palaces curator Lucy Worsley {{presented}} a BBC film, Food in England', The Lost World of Dorothy Hartley, on 6 November 2015. Worsley, writing in The Telegraph, calls Food in England [...] "the definitive {{history of the}} way the English eat." [...] She describes the book as [...] "laden with odd facts and folklore ... a curious mixture of cookery, history, anthropology and even magic, ... with her own strong and lively illustrations." [...] She admits it is not a conventional history, since Hartley breaks [...] "the first rule of the historian: to cite her evidence. She wasn't fond of footnotes." [...] In a year of filming Hartley's places and people she knew, Worsley discovered that [...] "my frustration with her technique as historian was misplaced." [...] Hartley had travelled continually to gather materials for her weekly Daily Sketch column, sometimes <b>sleeping</b> <b>rough</b> [...] "in a hedge." [...] The work is thus effectively, Worsley argues, an oral history, as Hartley interviewed [...] "the last generation to have had countryside lives sharing something in common with the Tudors." [...] The emphasis on local, seasonal food chimes well, Worsley suggests, with the modern trend for just those things.|$|E
