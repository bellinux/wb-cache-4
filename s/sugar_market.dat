25|$|The sugar-based {{economy of}} the islands faced stiff {{competition}} from Spain's American colonies. Low prices in the <b>sugar</b> <b>market</b> in the 19th century caused severe recessions on the islands. A new cash crop, cochineal (cochinilla), came into cultivation during this time, saving the islands' economy. During this time the Canarian-American trade was developed, in which Canarian products such as cochineal, sugarcane and rum are sold in American ports, such as Veracruz, Campeche, La Guaira and Havana among others.|$|E

In response to this and to other rulings of the WTO, and owing to internal pressures on the EU sugar-régime, the European Commission proposed on 22 June 2005 a radical reform of the EU sugar-régime, cutting prices by 39% and eliminating all EU sugar exports.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially, these reforms included the introduction of set-aside in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels. One of these reforms entailed the modification of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the <b>sugar</b> <b>market</b> between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.|$|E

40|$|Sugar {{is one of}} {{the most}} highly {{protected}} agricultural commodities worldwide. This protection depresses trade opportunities and the prices received by exporters without preferential market access. For this reason, dialogues about sugar policy are often polarized and short sound bites caustic. Yet today’s <b>sugar</b> <b>markets</b> are being driven by a complex array of dynamic and emerging supply, demand, and policy forces that need to be understood. A number of these forces have the potential to reshape the global <b>market</b> scene. Recent <b>sugar</b> policy reforms in the European Union (EU) have received little attention in North America but may turn the EU into a net importer, with substantial compensation paid to its farmers and displaced processing facilities. High oil prices and the related ethanol boom place Brazil at the fulcrum of new market developments. In the United States, corn sweetener and <b>sugar</b> <b>markets</b> are being integrated with Mexican markets under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), raising the question of whether the EU reforms provide a template for new policies. And among developing countries in Africa and elsewhere there are low-cost producers that would benefit from more open trade but others who would be disadvantaged by the loss of preferential markets. This discussion paper presents the proceedings of a one-day conference that served as a forum for the discussion of these and other critical issues affecting global <b>sugar</b> <b>markets,</b> policies, and reform options. The conference was attended by 60 representatives of governments, research institutions, producers and processors from the sugar sector, and other groups interested in <b>sugar</b> <b>markets</b> and policies. The four papers were presented by internationally recognized experts from the EU, Brazil, the United States, and South Africa. Discussion openers and general discussion at the conference added further policy insights, and the papers were edited and revised after the conference to reflect the dialogue that had occurred.

2500|$|Sugar {{plantations}} {{suffered from}} many of the same afflictions that manufacturing market segments in the United States continue to feel. [...] Labor costs increased significantly when Hawaii became a state and workers were no longer effectively indentured servants. [...] The hierarchical caste system plantation managers had worked hard to maintain began to break down, with greater racial integrations as a result, ironically, of the sugarcane plantations. [...] Workers began to discover they had rights, and in 1920 waged the first multi-cultural strike. Additionally global politics played a large role in the downfall of Hawaiian sugar. [...] Shifting political alliances between 1902 and 1930 permitted Cuba to have a larger share of the United States <b>sugar</b> <b>market,</b> holding 45% of the domestic quota while Hawaii, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico shared 25%.|$|E

Contemporary news reports in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal both told of the collision's impact on the <b>sugar</b> <b>market.</b> Claus A.

Further affecting the situation was World War I, then ongoing in Europe, which had reduced the tonnage of shipping available to transport commodities like sugar. With all of these factors, the asking price for sugar futures contracts for February 1915 delivery was 2.90 cents per pound (6.39 cents per kg) a week before Washingtonians sinking, but had risen to 3.16 cents per pound (6.96 cents per kg) the day after the sinking.|$|E

40|$|The ongoing trade negotiations, {{unilateral}} trade {{concessions and}} {{obligations under the}} WTO are pushing the EU sugar regime to undertake reforms. These reforms will alter the positions of developing countries in the global <b>sugar</b> <b>markets.</b> Gradual changes within the tariff rate quotas in the EU sugar regime would have a very marginal impact on the flow of sugar exports to the EU and world <b>sugar</b> <b>markets</b> as well. The simulation {{results showed that the}} scheduled changes in tariff rate quotas and transition period are stalling the impacts of tariff liberalisation granted by the EBA concession. Small concessions will not threaten the EU internal market, but total liberalisation of sugar imports from the LDCs will be a major threat to the EU sugar regime. Conversely, the EU would gain from the liberalisation scenarios in welfare terms due to cheaper imports of sugar. The current regime limits sugar imports from all developing countries or some efficient producers, if the cost data is a right estimate of the potential supply response from developing countries.
