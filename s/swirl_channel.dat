As {{electronic devices}} become further more integrated and powerful, more effective cooling {{is required to}} remove increasing heat fluxes generated by smaller devices. Microchannel heat sink has been recognized as a very promising cooling technology since it was brought up by Tuckerman and Pease. The {{purpose of the present}} work is to numerically study the cooling performance of microchannel heat sinks under non-uniform heating conditions and to compare to that under uniform heating conditions. Water with temperature-dependent properties is used. The temperature distribution, pressure drop, and total thermal resistance of the heat sink are selected as criteria of their cooling performance. The heat sinks are tested under various inlet velocities and heat fluxes. Firstly, cross-linked microchannel heat sink is used for cooling of heat source with hotspots. Three widths of cross-linked channel which are 0. 5 mm, 1 mm, 2 mm are compared to straight channel with different positions and amount of hotspots on the bottom surface of the heat sink. Secondly, straight channel micro heat sinks are studied and optimized IV under continuously varying heat flux conditions. Two layouts of the heat sink are proposed on which heat fluxes change perpendicular and along flow direction, respectively. Then, the layout with better cooling performance is optimized with Taguchi method. Finally, a novel <b>swirl</b> <b>channel</b> heat sink is employed for cooling of continuously varying heat flux conditions on a circular plate and is compared to uniform heating. Erenow, four cross sectional geometries of the channel (rectangular, trapezoidal, inverse-trapezoidal, and isosceles triangular) are compared for the heat sink...|$|E

The flow analysis {{focuses on the}} axial and tangential velocity components and their modification with changes in the intensity of <b>swirl</b> along the <b>channel.</b> Particular prominence is given to an anomalous flow, the ‘dead water core’, occurring at the greatest swirl intensities.

I was no longer helplessly in the dark. I got out my Bradshaw, and sat with the map spread out over the breakfast things studying the routes to Mayo.

40|$|The high heat-flux {{divertor}} of the Wendelstein 7 -X large stellarator experiment {{consists of}} 10 divertor units which {{are designed to}} carry a steady-state heat flux of 10 MW/m 2. However, the edge elements of this divertor are limited to only 5 MW/m 2, and may be overloaded in certain plasma scenarios. It is proposed to reduce this heat by placing an additional “scraper element ” {{in each of the}} ten divertor locations. It will be constructed using carbon fiber composite (CFC) monoblock technology. The design of the monoblocks and the path of the cooling tubes must be optimized in order to survive the significant steady-state heat loads, provide adequate coverage for the existing divertor, be located within sub-millimeter accuracy, and take into account the boundaries to other in vessel components, all at a minimum cost. Computational fluid dynamics modeling has been performed to examine the thermal transfer through the monoblock <b>swirl</b> tube <b>channels</b> for the design of the monoblock orientation. An iterative physics modeling and computer aided design process is being performed to optimize the placement of the scraper element within the severe spatial restrictions...|$|R
40|$|A {{conclusive}} {{safety assessment}} of a fusion reactor requires that the thermal response of the divertor assembly is known {{with a high degree}} of accuracy. Such accuracy is mandated because the divertor assembly is subjected to the highest levels of incident heat flux within the reactor. In order to accurately predict the thermal response of the divertor’s cooling channels, it is necessary to have a complete model of the Nukiyama boiling curve for the water conditions of interest. Currently published models of the Nukiyama curve for fusion divertor channels have only included the regimes of forced convection, partially and fully developed nucleate boiling, and the local CHF. This paper presents a model that includes these pre-CHF regimes and the post-CHF regime of transition boiling. The model is unique because (1) it tightly integrates the respective heat transfer correlations and makes heat transfer predictions for the water conditions and incident heat fluxes that are fusion-specific, (2) predicts post-CHF heat transfer properties for a <b>swirl</b> tape divertor <b>channel,</b> and (3) validates its predictions via comparison with experimental data. Based on these three points, this model is considered as one of the best available methods for predicting the Nukiyama curve for a water-cooled fusion device. I...|$|R
60|$|Hewet and Rachel {{had long}} ago reached the {{particular}} place {{on the edge of}} the cliff where, looking down into the sea, you might chance on jelly-fish and dolphins. Looking the other way, the vast expanse of land gave them a sensation which is given by no view, however extended, in England; the villages and the hills there having names, and the farthest horizon of hills as often as not dipping and showing a line of mist which is the sea; here the view was one of infinite sun-dried earth, earth pointed in pinnacles, heaped in vast barriers, earth widening and spreading away and away like the immense floor of the sea, earth chequered by day and by night, and partitioned into different lands, where famous cities were founded, and the races of men changed from dark savages to white civilised men, and back to dark savages again. Perhaps their English blood made this prospect uncomfortably impersonal and hostile to them, for having once turned their faces that way they next turned them to the sea, and for the rest of the time sat looking at the sea. The sea, though it was a thin and sparkling water here, which seemed incapable of surge or anger, eventually narrowed itself, clouded its pure tint with grey, and <b>swirled</b> through narrow <b>channels</b> and dashed in a shiver of broken waters against massive granite rocks. It was this sea that flowed up to the mouth of the Thames; and the Thames washed the roots of the city of London.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCollective {{migration}} of mechanically coupled cell layers is a notable feature of wound healing, embryonic development, and cancer progression. In confluent epithelial sheets, the dynamics {{have been found}} to be highly heterogeneous, exhibiting spontaneous formation of swirls, long-range correlations, and glass-like dynamic arrest as a function of cell density. In contrast, the flow-like properties of one-sided cell-sheet expansion in confining geometries are not well understood. Here, we studied the short- and long-term flow of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells as they moved through microchannels. Using single-cell tracking and particle image velocimetry (PIV), we found that a defined averaged stationary cell current emerged that exhibited a velocity gradient in the direction of migration and a plug-flow-like profile across the advancing sheet. The observed flow velocity can be decomposed into a constant term of directed cell migration and a diffusion-like contribution that increases with density gradient. The diffusive component is consistent with the cell-density profile and front propagation speed predicted by the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation. To connect diffusion-mediated transport to underlying cellular motility, we studied single-cell trajectories and occurrence of vorticity. We discovered that the directed large-scale cell flow altered fluctuations in cellular motion at short length scales: vorticity maps showed a reduced frequency of <b>swirl</b> formation in <b>channel</b> flow compared with resting sheets of equal cell density. Furthermore, under flow, single-cell trajectories showed persistent long-range, random-walk behavior superimposed on drift, whereas cells in resting tissue did not show significant displacements with respect to neighboring cells. Our work thus suggests that active cell migration manifests itself in an underlying, spatially uniform drift as well as in randomized bursts of short-range correlated motion that lead to a diffusion-mediated transport...|$|R
40|$|An {{aggressive}} low {{aspect ratio}} scoping fusion reactor design {{indicated that a}} 2 GW(e) reactor can have a major radius as small as 2. 9 m resulting in a device with competitive cost of electricity at 49 mill/kWh. One of the technology requirements of this design is a high performance high power density first wall and blanket system. A 15 MPa helium-cooled, V-alloy and stagnant LiPb breeder first wall and blanket design was utilized. Due to the low solubility of tritium in LiPb, there is the concern of tritium migration {{and the formation of}} V-hydride. To address these issues, a lithium breeder system with high solubility of tritium has been evaluated. Due to the reduction of blanket energy multiplication to 1. 2, to maintain a plant Q of > 4, the major radius of the reactor has to be increased to 3. 05 m. The inlet helium coolant temperature is raised to 436 C {{in order to meet the}} minimum V-alloy temperature limit everywhere in the first wall and blanket system. To enhance the first wall heat transfer, a <b>swirl</b> tape coolant <b>channel</b> design is used. The corresponding increase in friction factor is also taken into consideration. To reduce the coolant system pressure drop, the helium pressure is increased from 15 to 18 MPa. Thermal structural analysis is performed for a simple tube design. With an inside tube diameter of 1 cm and a wall thickness of 1. 5 mm, the lithium breeder can remove an average heat flux and neutron wall loading of 2 and 8 MW/m(2), respectively. This reference design can meet all the temperature and material structural design limits, as well as the coolant velocity limits. Maintaining an outlet coolant temperature of 650 C, one can expect a gross closed cycle gas turbine thermal efficiency of 45 %. This study further supports the use of helium coolant for high power density reactor design. When used with the low aspect ratio reactor concept a competitive fusion reactor can be projected at 51. 9 mill/kWh...|$|R
40|$|The main {{research}} {{area of the}} PhD thesis refers to the actual and global problem of ecology, related to the gradually increasing pollution of the Earth's atmosphere by the greenhouse emissions. These emissions form during the combustion of the fossil fuels (CO_ 2, CH_ 4, NO_x) and lead to the global warming of the Earth's surface and surrounding atmosphere, thus initiating the climate changes. With the aim to solve this problem, this thesis investigates the ways to restrict {{the formation of the}} greenhouse emissions during the fuel combustion. As an effective tool to reduce the carbon emissions, the method of thermal decarbonization of the fossil fuel is applied, using the electric control of fuel decarbonization. The theoretical analysis of the mechanism of the electric field and flame interaction allows to conclude that the electrical force drives the ion (C_ 2 H_ 4 "+, C_ 3 H_ 3 "+, CHO"+, O"-_ 2, etc.) drift motion in the field direction by initiating the interrelated processes of heat and mass transfer, which could vary the flame temperature and composition fields. The results of experimental studies show that the electric field effect on the fuel combustion, fuel decarbonization, soot formation, carbon capture and sequestration can be used to reduce the levels of greenhouse emissions from the flame. For example, reduces the levels of CO_ 2 emissions in the pollutants are 10 - 15 %, but NO_x#approx# 25 %. The electrical processing of the soot formation and carbon sequestration from propane combustion are studied too for the conditions of the incomplete mixing of the axial fuel flow with the swirling airflow at the burner outlet, providing the stage combustion along the <b>swirling</b> flame <b>channel</b> flow. The <b>swirling</b> flame flow has a relative cold central core with a hot reaction zone forming an envelope between the fuel rich flame core and the surrounding swirling air co-flow. Experimentally it is observed that the air swirl motion under certain conditions promotes the stable stratification of the flame temperature and composition fields with an intensive and lasting propane pyrolysis along the fuel-rich flame core, thus enhancing the nucleation of the primary soot precursors and the formation of soot nanoparticles. The measurements of the flame temperature profiles show that the processes of propane decomposition, nucleation of soot precursors and soot growth along the flame channel flow are developing at the presence of the relatively high radial temperature gradients in the flame core. The radial temperature gradients along the flame core initiate the thermodiffusion of soot precursors and thermophoretic transport of soot nanoparticles to the steel rod surface that is arranged along the centerline of the swirl flame core, thus reducing the levels of greenhouse emissions (CO_ 2) in the products. The more effective soot formation and carbon sequestration from the swirling flame is achieved using the radial electric field control of the swirling flame. These soot nanoparticles produced by the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons could be further used in chemical industry as reaction catalysts or coloring in the production of the paints for laser printers and copying machines. Besides, the chemically-active carbon nanoparticles could be used for high-efficient energy production in electrochemical fuel cells.
