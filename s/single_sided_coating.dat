25|$|<b>Single</b> <b>sided</b> disks were <b>coated</b> on both <b>sides,</b> {{despite the}} {{availability}} of more expensive double sided disks. The reason usually given for the higher cost was that double sided disks were certified error-free {{on both sides of}} the media. Double-sided disks could be used in some drives for single-sided disks, as long as an index signal was not needed. This was done one side at a time, by turning them over (flippy disks); more expensive dual-head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced, and eventually became used universally.|$|R

40|$|A {{wideband}} {{and high}} gain dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) operating in hybrid HEM 11 δ mode is proposed. The investigated geometry employs one cylindrical dielectric resonator partially {{covered with a}} transparent dielectric superstrate and backed up by a <b>single</b> <b>side</b> metal <b>coated</b> dielectric reflector plane. The reflector is dedicated for gain enhancement while the superstrate is employed for merging of two resonant bands resulting in a single wide band. The dielectric resonator is excited by simple microstrip feed slot coupling technique and operates over X-band, ranging from 7. 12 [*]GHz to 8. 29 [*]GHz, that is, of 15. 18 % impedance matching bandwidth with 11. 34 [*]dBi peak gain. The different development stages like standalone DRA, DRA with superstrate, DRA with reflector, and DRA with both superstrate and reflector plane with respect to bandwidth and gain performances are analyzed properly. To the best of authors’ knowledge, {{this is the first}} time this type of combination of both superstrate and reflector plane is demonstrated in DRA engineering. An antenna prototype was fabricated and characterized and a very good agreement is achieved between the simulated and measured results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel method for {{fabrication}} of dou-ble <b>side</b> <b>coated</b> wafers by back-to-back Direct Wafer Bond-ing (DWB). Two 3 inch sapphire wafers (R-cut) were coated each with YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 −δ by laser ablation on one side. The wafers were then directly bonded with their uncoated sides {{together in a}} microcleanroom. Subsequent heating increased the bond energy up to energies sufficient for fabrication of hybrid devices working at cryogenic temperatures. TEM cross sections reveal direct contact of the two sapphire lat-tices. PACS: 68. 35. -p; 68. 55. -a; 74. 72. -h Conventional design of double <b>side</b> <b>coated</b> films on large sapphire or LaAlO 3 substrate wafers are currently fabricated by means of standard epitaxial procedures, e. g. pulsed laser deposition, off-axis sputtering and thermal co-evaporation u...|$|R
