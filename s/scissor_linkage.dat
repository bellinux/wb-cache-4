40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel deployable mechanism. Unlike most deployable structures, which have one degree of freedom, the proposed device can be deployed and compacted independently in two directions. This widens {{the range of}} its potential applications, including flexible industrial fixtures and deployable tents. The mechanismâ€™s basic deployable unit is assembled by combining a <b>scissor</b> <b>linkage</b> and a Sarrus linkage. The kinematic properties of the two component linkages and the combined unit are analyzed. The new deployable mechanism is obtained by linking the deployable units. The Mobility and kinematics are analyzed. The relationship between the degree of overconstraint {{and the number of}} deployable units is derived. The magnification ratio is calculated {{as a function of the}} geometry of the link and the number of deployable units.

40|$|A novel {{family of}} {{deployable}} mechanisms (DMs) is presented. Unlike most such devices, which have one degree-of-freedom (DOF), the proposed DM can be deployed and compacted independently {{in two or}} three directions. This widens the range of its potential applications, including flexible industrial fixtures and deployable tents. The mechanism's basic deployable unit (DU) is assembled by combining a <b>scissor</b> <b>linkage</b> and a Sarrus linkage. The kinematic properties of these two components and of the combined unit are analyzed. The conditions under which the unit can be maximally compacted and deployed are determined through singularity analysis. New 2 DOF DMs are obtained by linking the DUs: each mechanism's shape can be modified in two directions. The relationship between the degree of overconstraint and the number of DUs is derived. The magnification ratio is calculated as a function of link thickness and the number of DUs. The idea of deployment in independent directions is then extended to three dimensions with a family of 3 DOF mechanisms. Finally, kinematic simulations are performed to validate the proposed designs and analyses...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} multi-unit mechanism, {{which can be}} used to approximate, with two {{independent}} degrees of freedom, the shape of the geometric outline of an arbitrarily large area. The new device is a variant of a recently introduced planar deployable mechanism with two uncoupled degrees of freedom, built from identical units, each combining Sarrus and <b>scissor</b> <b>linkages.</b> Similar units, but with varying sizes, are used in the new device, which is able to change its elliptical physical boundary by varying independently the two parameters in the standard ellipse equation. The size and placement of the deployable units and their links are analyzed and selected for getting the expected geometric shape. The relationships between the number of dividing lines and the approximating accuracy and the degree of overconstraint, respectively, are calculated. A similar deployable mechanism controlling a hyperbola is also outlined. Kinematic analysis and simulated models show that the mechanisms can be used to approximate geometric curves, as desired...|$|R
40|$|The chapter {{presents}} {{a family of}} new deployable mechanisms obtained by conjoining an indefinite number of copies and variants of the same basic spatial linkage. The unit mechanism is an assembly of <b>scissor</b> and Sarrus <b>linkages</b> able to move {{in two or three}} independent directions. Unlike most deployable structures, which have one degree of freedom, the proposed devices can be deployed and compacted independently in two or three directions. Moreover, the physical boundary of the mechanism can be used to approximate and control the shape of some geometric curves. Kinematic simulations are performed to validate the proposed designs...|$|R
