50|$|Binding of MgATP {{is one of}} {{the central}} events to occur in the {{mechanism}} employed by nitrogenase. Hydrolysis of the terminal phosphate group of MgATP provides the energy needed to transfer electrons from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein. The binding interactions between the MgATP phosphate groups and the amino acid residues of the Fe protein are well understood by comparing to similar enzymes, while the interactions {{with the rest of the}} molecule are more elusive due to the lack of a Fe protein crystal structure with MgATP bound (as of 1996). Three protein residues have been shown to have significant interactions with the phosphates, shown in Figure 6. In the absence of MgATP, a salt bridge exists between residue 15, lysine, and residue 125, aspartic acid. Upon binding, this salt bridge is interrupted. <b>Site-specific</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> has demonstrated that when the lysine is substituted for a glutamine, the protein’s affinity for MgATP is greatly reduced and when the lysine is substituted for an arginine, MgATP cannot bind due to the salt bridge being too strong. The necessity of specifically aspartic acid at site 125 has been shown through noting altered reactivity upon mutation of this residue to glutamic acid. The third residue that has been shown to be key for MgATP binding is residue 16, serine. <b>Site-specific</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> was used to demonstrate this fact. This has led to a model in which the serine remains coordinated to the Mg2+ ion after phosphate hydrolysis in order to facilitate its association with a different phosphate of the now ADP molecule. MgATP binding also induces significant conformational changes within the Fe protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to create mutants in which MgATP binds but does not induce a conformational change. Comparing X-ray scattering data in the mutants versus in the wild-type protein led to the conclusion that the entire protein contracts upon MgATP binding, with a decrease in radius of approximately 2.0 Å.|$|E

Some of the mutants lacked the ability to infect S. exigua larvae per os. The gene(s) responsible for this phenotype in SeMNPV was mapped within a contiguous sequence encoding ORFs 29 - 35. In this paper we have shown that SeMNPV ORFs 15 - 35 (including genes encoding cathepsin, chitinase, GP 37, PTPT- 2, EGT, PKIP- 1 and ARIF- 1) are not essential for virus replication in cell culture or by in vivo intrahaemocoelic injection.

Double strand breaks are important for <b>site-specific</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> in that they stimulate the cell’s natural DNA-repair processes, namely homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. When the cell uses the non-homologous end joining pathway to repair the double-strand break, the inherent inaccuracy of the repair often generates precisely targeted mutations. This results in embryos with targeted gene knockout. Standard microinjection techniques allow this technology to make knockout rats in 4-6 months. A major advantage of ZFN- and TALEN-mediated gene knockout relative {{to the use of}} mobile DNA is that a particular gene can be uniquely and specifically targeted for knockout.

Here we used a new technique of <b>site-specific</b> chromosomal <b>mutagenesis</b> to introduce a selected set of mostly destabilizing mutations into folA - an essential chromosomal gene of E. coli encoding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) - to determine how changes in protein stability, activity and abundance affect fitness.

We found no significant correlation between protein stability and its catalytic activity nor between catalytic activity and fitness in a limited range of variation of catalytic activity observed in mutants. The stability of these mutants is strongly correlated with their intracellular abundance; suggesting that protein homeostatic machinery plays an active role in maintaining intracellular concentrations of proteins. Fitness also shows a significant correlation with intracellular abundance of soluble DHFR in cells growing at 30 oC. At 42 oC, on the other hand, the picture was mixed, yet remarkable: a few strains carrying mutant DHFR proteins aggregated rendering them nonviable, but, intriguingly, the majority exhibited fitness higher than wild type.

Point mutations were separately introduced into A 296 and V 344 positions using degenerate primer sets containing 32 codons to generate two libraries of variants. LIP 4 variants were heterologously expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. A specific plate assay was used to identify lipase-producing P. pastoris clones in a medium containing tributyrin.

Datta (2005) Biochem. J. 387, 591 – 600], the mechanisms that determine binding of substrate and cause product inhibition of adenosine kinase from Leishmania donovani remained unclear. In the present study, employing homology-model-guided <b>site-specific</b> protein <b>mutagenesis,</b> we showthat Asp 16 is indispensable, since its replacement with either valine or arginine resulted in a > 200 -fold increase in Km (Ado) with a 1000 -fold decrease in kcat/Km, implying its critical importance in Ado binding. Even glutamate replacement was not tolerated, indicating the essentiality of Asp 16 in the maintenance of steric complementarity of the binding pocket. Use of 2 �or 3 �- eoxygenated Ado as substrates indicated that, although both the hydroxy groups play important roles {{in the formation of}} the enzyme–Ado complex, the binding energy (��GB) contribution of the formerwas greater than the latter, suggesting possible formation of a bidentate hydrogen bond between Asp 16 and the adenosyl ribose. Interestingly, AMP-inhibition and AMP-binding studies revealed that, unlike the R 131 A mutant, which showed abrogated AMP-binding and insensitivity towards AMP inhibition despite its unaltered Km (Ado), all the Asp 16 mutants bound AMP efficiently and displayed AMP-sensitive catalytic activity, suggesting disparate mechanisms of binding of Ado and AMP. Molecular docking revealed that, although both Ado and AMP apparently occupied the same binding pocket, Ado binds in a manner that is subtly different from AMP binding, which relies heavily on hydrogen-bonding with Arg 131 and thus creates an appropriate environment for competition with Ado.

To examine the structural requirements for cleavage of the HA, the HA gene from a virulent H 5 influenza virus was expressed in mammalian cells (CV- 1), and the cleavage {{site of the}} HA was explored by using <b>site-specific</b> <b>mutagenesis.</b> The expressed HA protein exhibited normal cleavage, transport to the cell membrane, and ability to adsorb and to fuse erythrocytes at pH 5. <b>Site-specific</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> of the HA directly established that (i) most of the basic amino acids at this site are critical for cleavage activation; (ii) besides the connecting peptide sequence, {{at least one other}} structural feature of the HA is required for enzyme recognition; and (iii) the length of the connecting peptide can abrogate the structural feature(s) ...|$|E

40|$|Genomic segment S 12 of rice dwarf {{virus and}} segment S 9 of wound tumor virus, both {{members of the}} genus Phytoreovirus, have small {{out-of-phase}} overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed that rice dwarf virus S 12 mRNA specified translation products from the large ORF and two overlapping small ORFs both in rice plant hosts and in Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells. These results provide the first example of a tricistronic mRNA for a segmented double-stranded RNA virus. Similarly, wound tumor virus S 9 mRNA was found to direct the synthesis of protein products from both the large ORF and small out-of-frame ORF in S. frugiperda cells. Results of <b>site-specific</b> and deletion <b>mutagenesis</b> studies were consis-tent with a leaky scanning translation mechanism for the synthesis of the small ORFs. Rice dwarf virus (RDV) and wound tumor virus (WTV) {{are members of the}} genus Phytoreovirus (2), one of nine genera of the family Reoviridae. The properties shared by members of this genus include a double-stranded RNA genome composed of 12 independent segments and replication in both a plant host and a leafhopper insect vector.

40|$|The {{temperate}} mycobacteriophage Bxb 1 infects {{and forms}} lysogens of Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast-growing relative of and model for M. tuberculosis. In Bxb 1, {{as in other}} bacteriophages, switching between the lysogenic cycle and lytic cycle depends on a site-specific DNA recombinase called an integrase. In Bxb 1 the directionality of the DNA recombination process depends on the phage-encoded gp 47 protein, which acts as the Recombination Directionality Factor (RDF). A number of lines of evidence suggest that Bxb 1 gp 47 has some additional biological role as well, however. First, very close homologues are found in 15 other mycobacteriophages, including phage L 5, whose system for phage DNA integration / excision {{does not include the}} Bxb 1 gp 47 homologue. Second, Bxb 1 gp 47 and homologues are found clustered with genes for phage DNA replication. Here we present our investigation into the putative multi-functionality of Bxb 1 gp 47. To begin, we performed a bioinformatic analysis which predicts Bxb 1 gp 47 and its homologues to contain a calcineurin-like phosphoesterase domain; this domain is predicted to confer a metal-dependent phosphatase activity on these proteins. Further, we analyzed the phenotypic repercussions of altering the Bxb 1 gp 47 gene by <b>site-specific</b> phage <b>mutagenesis,</b> performed using Bacteriophage Recombineering by Electroporation of DNA (BRED). Results from this work were consistent with the hypothesis that Bxb 1 gp 47 has an essential function in the lytic-cycle replication of Bxb 1, and also showed that gp 47 RDF activity is separable from the lytic-cycle function inferred for gp 47. Finally, a number of variants of Bxb 1 gp 47 protein were overexpressed and purified for studies of RDF and phosphatase activity. RDF activity assays suggested that Motif I of the calcineurin-like phosphoesterase domain has no role in RDF activity, but that Motif V may be involved in both RDF and phosphatase activities. The phosphatase activity assays we have performed provide support for the hypothesis that Bxb 1 gp 47 is a manganese-dependent phosphatase enzyme. If this result is confirmed, Bxb 1 gp 47 will be revealed as a highly novel RDF with a secondary phosphatase activity...|$|R
40|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} phosphate oxidases (NOX) are {{a family}} of enzymes that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). The first NOX enzyme was discovered in leukocytes and associated with host defense in the immune system. Subsequent findings of ROS production in non-immune cells led to the identification of six additional NOX isoforms, and opened new avenues for research into NOX-mediated cellular functions. Since then, NOX-derived ROS {{have been found to}} be involved in a tremendous number of cell signaling pathways. Of particular interest is the well-established function of NOX-derived ROS in signaling pathways that drive cytoskeletal rearrangements and motility in several cell types. Our lab is interested in the highly motile neuronal growth cone that guides axonal growth during neurodevelopment and regeneration. Others have reported that inhibition of NOX enzymes during development causes a decrease in the size of some brain areas, and NOX deficiencies in humans are correlated with diminished cognitive function. Despite the fact that NOX activity is necessary for some cell motility in non-neuronal cells and a loss of NOX function during development has impacts on brain structure, it is still unclear what role NOX plays in axonal growth and guidance or the establishment of connections in the central nervous system. ^ In this series of studies, I investigated the function of NOX enzymes in neurite outgrowth and neurodevelopment using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. I report that NOX activity is necessary for the extension of neurites in culture. Inhibition NOX activity leads to a disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, a decrease in retrograde flow and a loss of neurite outgrowth. Using embryonic zebrafish, I showed that four separate nox genes are expressed broadly throughout the central nervous system during the first two days of development. Functional studies in zebrafish revealed that NOX inhibition leads to expansion of the ganglion cell layer in the retina and decrease in the size of the optic nerve. Subsequent studies using a <b>site-specific,</b> RNA-guided <b>mutagenesis</b> approach (CRISPR/Cas 9) showed that optic nerve thinning resulted from developmental delays while ganglion cell expansion was a permanent defect caused by the mutation of a specific NOX isoform, NOX 2 /CYBB. The targeting of optic nerve axons to the optic tectum of the midbrain was also disrupted in NOX 2 /CYBB mutants. These results show that NOX activity is critical for neurite outgrowth in cultured cells in addition to retinal development and axon targeting in vivo. ...|$|R
