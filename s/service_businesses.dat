In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore <b>service.</b> <b>Businesses,</b> schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to bandwidth limitations and the site's potential for distraction.|$|E
5|$|Caldas da Rainha {{has about}} 600 {{commercial}} establishments and calls itself Capital do Comércio Tradicional (capital of traditional commerce). The city's downtown/city centre (centro) shopping area contains shops specializing in clothing, jewellry, beauty supplies, decoration, housewares, and other goods. The main shopping streets include Rua dos Heróis da Grande Guerra, Rua Almirante Cândido dos Reis ({{popularly known as}} Rua das Montras, Street of Storefronts), Rua Doutor Miguel Bombarda, Rua da Liberdade, and surrounding streets. Praça da Republica (Republic Square), popularly known as Praça da Fruta (Fruit Square), hosts an outdoor farmers' market every morning. A weekly market selling cheap clothing and domestic items is held on Mondays uphill from the square. Several small indoor shopping centres, most {{with only a few}} shops, exist throughout the city. The Associação Comercial dos Concelhos das Caldas da Rainha e Óbidos (ACCCRO, Commercial Association of the Municipalities of Caldas da Rainha and Óbidos), founded in 1902, promotes and supports commercial and <b>service</b> <b>businesses</b> in Caldas da Rainha and neighboring Óbidos.|$|E

" Where {{there is such a}} paradox, substantial investment in extending the <b>service</b> <b>business</b> leads to increased service offerings and higher costs, but does not generate the expected correspondingly higher returns. We have worked with more than 30 equipment manufacturing companies to gain an understanding as to why manufacturing companies often fail to exploit the financial benefit of extending their <b>service</b> <b>business.</b> Based on this broad research, we attempt to provide guidance for managers in manufacturing companies seeking to successfully extend their <b>service</b> <b>business.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>business</b> Cognitive phenomena Organizational structuring...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>business</b> <b>service</b> innovation taxonomy where we link <b>business</b> <b>service</b> types to sources/drivers of innovation. <b>Business</b> <b>service</b> innovation {{can occur in}} the service concept, in the client interface, in the service delivery system and the underlying service technology. The major source of innovation and renewal in <b>business</b> <b>services</b> is regarded to be knowledge/competencies/intangible assets. We identify four competencies in <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms that potentially can drive innovation; customer competence, organizational competence, market and network competence and ICT competence. In order to align these competencies to <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> we develop a <b>business</b> <b>service</b> typology by arguing that degree of standardization and degree of client interaction in the service delivery process are the major categories for distinguishing <b>business</b> <b>services.</b> Based {{on a combination of}} these categories, four generic types of <b>business</b> <b>services</b> are identified: expert <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> client <b>business</b> <b>service,</b> special <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> and standard <b>business</b> <b>services.</b> Informed by the service innovation research and case examples from <b>business</b> <b>service</b> firms, we link the four <b>business</b> <b>service</b> types to innovation drivers (competencies types) and suggest a busines...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{first and}} second {{articles}} in the trilogy introduced shared <b>services</b> as a <b>business</b> model and the various models through which a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> can and must evolve to create value. The purpose of this third and final article in the trilogy of articles is to identify the key success factors required to successfully manage a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit. Methodology: A comprehensive literature {{study was conducted in}} order to identify the key success factors required to successfully manage a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit. This was followed up with an empirical study to determine if organisations that have implemented shared <b>services</b> as a <b>business</b> model are using any of these identified factors to successfully manage their respective shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> units. Findings: In the article, a framework is generated to help organisations understand the key success factors required to successfully manage a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit. This work has further potential in that the key factors required can also be used not only in the normal brick and mortar organisations, but also in virtual organisations. Implications: This article presents a comprehensive approach to understand the key success factors required to manage a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit. These findings are important as they can be applied to a conventional organisation as well as a virtual organisation. Value: This article provides an understanding of the key success factors required to manage a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> model. When these key success factors are used as a basis for the management of a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit, it will continuously create value for the organisation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Now that an {{organisation}} {{understands the}} concept of shared services (Article 1), it needs to implement shared <b>services</b> as a <b>business</b> model. The purpose of this second article in the trilogy is to describe the phases during the implementation process, {{as well as the}} various models through which a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit will evolve to continuously add value to the organisation. Methodology: A comprehensive literature study was conducted in order to: - Determine the steps in implementing a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> model, - Determine the various models associated with a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit, - Determine how the continuous evolution of shared services results in moving from one shared services model to the next shared services model. Findings: In this article, a framework is generated to help organisations understand the various phases and steps it needs to go through to successfully implement a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit. This work has further potential: when applied correctly, organisations will provide a business environment where effectiveness and efficiency is a given. Implications: This article presents the context for organisations to implement a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> model and to continuously evolve from one shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> model to the other to create value for the organisation. The findings are important for organisations that {{are in the process of}} implementing or have implemented shared services, as they can easily stagnate and fall into the trap of centralisation. Value: This article provides an understanding of what is required for the successful implementation of shared services. This value is further enhanced through continuous evolution from a basic shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> model to the virtual shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> model and beyond. </p...|$|R

25|$|In 1940, non-Hispanic whites {{constituted}} 86.8% of the city's population. The population {{peaked at}} {{more than two million}} residents in 1950, then began to decline with the restructuring of industry, which led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs. In addition, suburbanization had been drawing off many of the wealthier residents to outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. The economic impact of these changes would reduce Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government. Philadelphia struggled through a long period of adjustment to these economic changes. The city in fact approached bankruptcy in the late 1980s. Revitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century, with much of the development in the Center City and University City areas of the city. After many of the old manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting <b>service</b> <b>businesses</b> and began to more aggressively market itself as a tourist destination. Glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City. Historic areas such as Independence National Historical Park located in Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s. They are now among the most desirable living areas of Center City. This has slowed the city's 40-year population decline after it lost nearly one-quarter of its population.|$|E
