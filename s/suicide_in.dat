40|$|The {{number of}} <b>suicides</b> <b>in</b> English and Welsh prisons is increasing, but the excess {{compared}} with the general population has not been reliably quantified.

The overall standardised mortality ratio for suicide was 5. 1 (95 % CI, 4. 8 - 5. 3), suggesting a five-fold excess of <b>suicides</b> <b>in</b> male prisoners, with a particularly striking excess in boys aged 15 - 17 years (standardised mortality ratio 18 [13 - 26]).
