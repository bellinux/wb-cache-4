30|$|The {{development}} of irrigation is accompanied, {{in the majority}} of the cases, by the appearance of process of salinization, alkalization of soils to varying degrees or <b>sodization.</b> It also allows the {{development of}} arable soil areas in arid and semi-arid. These situations are in close relationship with the natural features of the environment (soil and climate) and procedures for water management for irrigation whose quality is decisive.|$|E
30|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} {{is accompanied}} by, no doubt, {{an abuse of}} agrochemical inputs and a reckless pumping of groundwater, which are becoming less and less abundant and of poor quality. This leads to a problem of overfertilizing. A number of field observations clearly show an excessive enrichment. Overexploitation of these resources, coupled with the phenomenon of drought, inevitably leads to degradation of soils and waters, which result in problems of salinization, <b>sodization</b> and deterioration of soil structure. The salinization of Sebkha Oran basin, as for most soils of the Maghreb, is initially of primary origin. The soils are in fact made of alluvial materials, more or less salty, resulting from {{the erosion of the}} reliefs and the alteration of the rocks. Soil salinization in these regions is related not only to climatic conditions but also to the often poorly controlled use of irrigation, which results in an accumulation of dissolved salts on the surface (Rahmoune et al. 2001).|$|E
40|$|In some soils of the Niger valley, alkalinization and <b>sodization</b> {{are related}} to the {{concentration}} of alteration products of calco-alkaline gneiss to biotite, which releases significant amounts of cations and alkalinity. The results is an oversaturation of the soil solution with respect to calcite, which precipitates with a positive calcite residual alkalinity. Ca 2 + molality decreases, while alkalinity and pH increases : Ca 2 + desorption is accompanied by adsorption of Na+ on the exchange complex. K+, Mg 2 +, and Na+ concentrations in the soil solution are successively controlled by the formation of illites and smectite-type silicates, while kaolinite dissolves. These processes were successfully simulated according to the analytical data. They agreed with the significant increase of the alkaline reserve in the soils according to chemical, physical, and mineralogical alterations. These geochemical mechanisms were found {{to be involved in the}} formation of alkali soils at three sites of the region. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the {{comments}} "Some observations {{with respect to}} sodicity hazard of irrigation waters", Dr. Van Hoorn opened a constructive discussion about the assessment of sodicity hazard of soils subjected to irrigation in arid or semi arid areas. The following are three concepts usually used for the afore mentioned assessment, which are reminded in his comment on our article: · The Sodium Adsorption Ratio, SAR = Na/((Ca+Mg) / 2) 1 / 2 in eq. L- 1, (Richards, 1954). · The adjusted SAR, SARadj = SAR (1 + (8. 4 – pHc)), (Suarez, 1981; Ayers and Westcot, 1985) · The Residual Sodium Carbonate, RSC = Alk. – Ca – Mg in eq. L- 1 (Eaton, 1950; Richards, 1954) We identified two major points in Dr's Van Hoorn comments. The first one deals with {{the assessment of the}} chemical quality of the water used in Niger with respect to soil <b>sodization</b> hazard (Barbiéro et al., 2001). Indeed, the sodicity hazard is low, low-moderate, or very high according to the SAR, the SARadj, or the RSC respectively. Therefore, the donors face with a difficult choice in developing new irrigation schemes in Niger valley. Dr. Van Hoorn concludes that the RSC is the most suitable indicator for the assessment of sodicity hazard of Niger irrigation water. With the second point Dr. Van Hoorn is considering if the process of magnesium precipitation should be taken into account for the assessment of sodicity hazard. Both questions will be answered successively...|$|E
