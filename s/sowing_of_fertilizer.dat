40|$|Based on a {{literature}} review {{for the period}} of 1982 – 2011, an analysis was performed of studies by various researchers concerning the exposure of private farmers to noise and vibration of the whole body with particular consideration of the annual exposure to these factors. The main sources of noise occurring in agriculture are: agricultural tractors mounted with a set of farm machinery, self-propelled machines, machinery for the production of fodder and workshop equipment. The review of literature showed that the highest values of equivalent exposure to noise (EA, T) or noise doses (d) were noted during the summer-autumn season and in spring. Mean noise levels for the entire year (of over 90 dB-A), considerably exceeded permissible values. The primary sources of the whole body vibration are agricultural vehicles including agricultural tractors of various types and self-propelled agricultural vehicles. In these vehicles vibration transmitted from the seat to the whole body is of basic importance. The measurements of vibration acceleration indicated that mechanical vibration on seats was produced while performing following activities: hay tedding and raking, <b>sowing</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertilizers,</b> aggregation <b>of</b> soil, grass mowing and cultivation. All of them may create a considerable health risk. These work activities are performed at elevated working speeds of tractors, most often along with hardened or uneven surfaces. In relation to the standard values (A(8) 40. 8 m/s 2), the mean daily vibration acceleration values remain below the permissible levels during all months of the year. However, considering the occurrence of mechanical shocks of high values (above the Maximum Acceptable Intensity) on agricultural vehicles there is a high risk for the spine problems among operators of agricultural vehicles...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{estimate}} wheat productivity in Bangladesh and forecast the future expected population and food requirements in the country by 2010. Design/methodology/approach – This paper reaches the objectives using total factors productivity approach, Box Jenkins approach, and sensitivity analysis for wheat farms in the country. The study used data on wheat during 1972 - 2002. Findings – In the existing situation, the national average level wheat yield was 1. 9 ?MT/ha that was lower than any other stations. The reasons are late sowing, coupled with lack of seed quality, excess moisture at <b>sowing,</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer</b> at reasonable price and timeliness at the farmers' level, and lack of capital. The total productivity grew at an average annual rate of 1. 35 percent. Practical implications – The {{results show that the}} Bangladeshi government could increase the domestic wheat supply by 56. 84, 115. 79, 247. 37, and 321. 58 percent depending, respectively, on the applied model I-IV, that is much higher than the existing level of production.

40|$|Forage sorghum {{is one of}} {{the most}} heat and drought {{resistant}} cereal forage having the potential to yield nutritious forage even during the months of extreme heat for dairy animals. It yields considerably higher biomass production with less use <b>of</b> <b>fertilizers</b> and irrigations. It can be grown in almost all types of soils and has the potential to tolerate soil toxicities without considerable reduction in green forage yield. But in Pakistan, per hectare green forage yield of sorghum is much less (about 13 tons per hectare in irrigated tracts) than the potential. Rainfed areas are producing even less green forage yield than irrigated tracts. A variety of factors reduce forage sorghum yield including selection of unsuitable forage sorghum cultivars, poor seed bed preparation, weeds and fewer use <b>of</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> Appropriate agronomic management strategies hold the key in bridging the gap between forage sorghum yield and potential. Appropriate variety selection, pre-sowing seed priming and seed treatment with fungicide, fine seed bed preparation, line <b>sowing,</b> balanced use <b>of</b> <b>fertilizers</b> at optimum time, irrigation management, insect-pest management and harvesting at 50 % flowering stage are few of the strategies which can increase the forage sorghum yield to a great extent. Appropriate agronomic management strategies are bound to increase the forage sorghum yield as well as its quality attributes particularly protein contents. In this way, sustainable supply of green forage during summer reduces the drastic effects of forage shortage and ultimately milk production on sustainable basis can be ensured to cater the needs of rising population...|$|R

40|$|Non-chemical {{methods for}} weed control play an {{important}} role for the management of weeds in organic cropping systems in Europe. With the expansion of the organic area in recent years, more research has been conducted to develop new methods and improve management strategies. Currently, weed harrows, rotary cultivators and inter-row cultivators are the principal methods used for full-width treatments in large agricultural crops, such as cereals, oil seed rape, maize and pulses. The mechanical methods are often combined with cultural measures, e. g. stale seedbeds, delayed <b>sowing,</b> placement <b>of</b> <b>fertilizers</b> etc., to benefit from the additive and sometimes even synergistic effects of combining direct and cultural methods. In row crops, such as sugar beets and horticultural crops, thermal and mechanical methods are mostly combined to remove as many weeds in the rows as possible in order to minimize the need for manual weeding. Weeds growing between the rows are easily controlled by inter-row cultivation. Robotic weeding for intra-row weed control is now possible for transplanted crops, and inter-row hoes have been equipped with GPS-systems and cameras for optimizing precision and steering. Works on new GPS technology is currently focusing on seeding systems with the ability to create parallel or diamond crop establishment patterns, which enable inter-row hoeing to be conducted in different directions. So far, non-chemical methods have had little uptake in conventional farming but national and EU-based legislative initiatives may change the situation radically in the near future. Several European countries have launched pesticide action plans and the EU a new directive for the implementation of integrated pest management (IPM); all aiming for minimizing the reliance on herbicides. This is expected to accentuate the need for non-chemical methods...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{increased}} CO 2, temperature and nitrogen on leaf photosynthesis of wheat were investigated in two field experiments under temperature gradient tunnels in a Mediterranean environment. Ambient and 700 μmol mol- 1 CO 2, ambient and 4 ºC warmer temperatures, and 80 and 120 kg nitrogen ha- 1 were compared. Although rising CO 2 concentrations increased photosynthesis, measurements {{at the same}} CO 2 concentration showed decreased photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in plants grown at elevated CO 2. Elevated growth CO 2 decreased photosynthesis for any given value of intercellular CO 2 concentration. Downward acclimation of photosynthesis was decreased at temperatures 4 ºC above ambient and high nitrogen supply, under both photorespiratory and non-photorespiratory measurement conditions. Growth in elevated CO 2 decreased the quantum yield of Photosystem II (PSII) electron transport and the efficiency of energy capture by open PSII centres. At later stages of leaf growth, warm temperatures decreased maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) at low, but not at high nitrogen supply. Fv/Fm increased with nitrogen application, although the quantum yield of electron transport in the light remained unchanged. The technical cooperation of Angel Verdejo is acknowledged.

40|$|A crop {{physiological}} study upon yield in wheat {{was undertaken}} at Wagga, {{located in the}} wheat belt of southern New South Wales, in 1961 and 1962. The effects <b>of</b> time <b>of</b> <b>sowing,</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>sowing</b> and <b>fertilizer</b> application were investigated. The variety, Heron, was used throughout. Comprehensive measurements during the growth cycle of the crops were made upon total dry weight and its components, photosynthetic area, evapotranspiration, soil moisture stress and plant moisture stress (using the leaf relative turgidity technique). Time <b>of</b> <b>sowing</b> {{had little effect on}} the soil moisture available to the crop at flowering. However post flowering climatic conditions were hotter and drier for the later sown crops, and consequently plant moisture stress occurred sooner after flowering. Yields fell in both years with later sowings,at an average rate of 2 bushels/acre for each week' s delay in sowing. Increased fertilizer application and increased rate <b>of</b> <b>sowing</b> increased the vegetative growth, and the potential yield at flowering, but this was associated with small reductions in the soil moisture at flowering and an earlier onset of plant moisture stress. The increased vegetative growth usually resulted in increased grain yields, but under drier conditions grain yields were reduced. Nitrogenous fertilizer appeared to have additional effects on the crop which may under some conditions be detrimental to grain yield. Certain interrelationships within the soil/crop system were evident from these trials. Evapotranspiration increased as photosynthetic area index increased when soil moisture was adequate. Leaf relative turgidity at sunrise was closely related to soil moisture stress. Grain yield variation was highly correlated with variation in photosynthetic area duration after flowering. Photosynthetic area duration was related to photosynthetic area index at flowering and to the level of plant moisture stress after flowering, which governed the rate of senescence of this photosynthetic tissue. These results and the value of this type of crop physiological study of yield in wheat are discussed. The application of some aspects of the results to wheat agronomy and breeding is apparent.

The total grain yield, wheat yield proportion at harvest, yield components, N efficiency, grain protein concentration, residual soil mineral N aft er harvest, and land equivalent ratios (LER) were compared. The fertilized 50 : 50 intercrop was a good compromise between production (yields and wheat protein concentration), N efficiency, and limited residual soil N. The unfertilized 50 : 50 intercrop had the lowest grain yields and wheat protein concentration. An early overfertilization increased the proportion of wheat yield at harvest, whereas a late overfertilization increased the wheat grain protein concentration. Increasing the proportion <b>of</b> pea at <b>sowing</b> was a good way to produce more pea yield.

Presently, the Romanian agriculture faces a crisis <b>of</b> chemical <b>fertilizers.</b> For nearly five decades Romania has developed a significant industry based on production <b>of</b> chemical <b>fertilizers.</b> Currently, this industry {{is in a state}} of collapse; the EU rejected the Romania’s request to obtain grants for chemical fertilizers because it considers this form of support as aid grants from the state.

The hypothesis was estimated be found the effect of significant interaction between the dosage <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and kind <b>of</b> adenium. The assumption of the dosage <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer</b> or kind <b>of</b> adenium. The research was conducted in Mulyoagung Dau Malang between Agustus until Novenber 2007. The elevated place about 560 m dpl. The equipment used in this research included plastic pot, analytical weighs, ruler, jangka sorong, beaker glass, sprayer, palstic, book and balpoint. The materials used were seedling of adenium, sand, sekam charcoal, deskastar plus, mipchin 5 WP, dithane M- 45. This research used the factorial randomized blok design (RBD) with tree replication. The first faktor is kind of adenium consisted of two levels: V 1 (la on thong of Adenium) V 2 (harry potter of Adenium), and the second factor was dosage <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer</b> with five levels: D 0 : no fertilizer (control), D 1 : 1 g/plant dosage <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> D 2 : 2 g/plant dosage <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> D 3 : 3 g/plant dosage <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer</b> dekastar plus, D 4 : 3 g/plant dosage <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> D 5 : 5 g/plant dosage <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer</b> dekastar plus. Result of the research showed that there were significant interaction between the treatment variable at the plant height and the diameters bonggol. The combination this good treatment was V 1 D 4 (la on thong with dosage 4 g/plant of ferlitizer), and V 1 D 5 (la on thong with dosage 5 g/plant of ferlitizer), V 2 D 4 (harry potter with dosage 4 g/plant of ferlitizer), V 2 D 5 (harry potter at dosage 5 g/plant of ferlitizer). The kind of harry potter show result of which {{is better to be}} compared the la on thong. The dosage 4 g/plant <b>of</b> <b>fertilizer</b> is better on the height of plant and diameter of bonggol, and 5 g/plant on the number and leaf area...|$|R

This study was therefore planned to evaluate the effect of soil applied phosphorus (DAP) and foliar applica-tion <b>of</b> nitrogenous <b>fertilizer</b> (urea) on growth, yield {{and quality of}} potato. Experiment was com-prised of four different treatments of phosphorus (DAP, 46 % P) and nitrogen (urea, 46 % N) in-cluding a control. Treatments were T 0 (DAP 160 + Urea 300 kg/acre), T 1 (DAP 160 + Urea 5 kg/acre), T 2 (DAP 100 + Urea 6 kg/acre) and T 3 (DAP 120 + Urea 8 kg/acre). DAP fertilizer was given as basal dressing at the time <b>of</b> <b>sowing.</b> Foliar applications <b>of</b> nitrogenous <b>fertilizer</b> (urea) were given after 30 <b>of</b> <b>sowing</b> with one week interval in five split doses. Results indicated that T 3 remained better regarding productivity and quality of potato. The overall fertilizer efficacy re...|$|R
