30|$|Masonry {{walls and}} {{concrete}} blocks {{have long been}} used in construction, and much {{research has been conducted}} on them in other countries. Recently, Jonaitis and Zavalis (2013) conducted a test to determine the compression behavior of an empty concrete block and of another block filled with grouted concrete. A fracture was found on the mortar joint of the empty concrete block, and as such, an increase in compression stress caused lateral deformation. Furthermore, it was discovered that the concrete block filled with grouted concrete showed a compression behavior similar to that of cast-in-place concrete. Shing et al. (1989) evaluated the fracture mechanism, ductility, and energy dissipation capacity of <b>shear</b> <b>block</b> walls through the cyclic loading test to determine their nonlinear behavior. Based on the test results, he reported that through seismic retrofit by using <b>shear</b> <b>block</b> walls, a resistance capacity to shear and ductility could be acquired to some degree. Zhai and Stewart (2010) presented a new theoretical equation with the material strength, types of live load, the ratio of dead load to live load, and the combination of the eccentricity and concentric load as parameters to establish the safety guideline for reinforced block walls in China, and verified the appropriateness of the equation through tests. In Japan, form blocks are widely used in new construction projects where only grouted concrete used to fill the hollow zones inside the blocks would be considered to provide sufficient strength, and blocks would be considered to function only as a form (Architecture Institute of Japan 2006).|$|E

40|$|The <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> {{strength}} of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) glulam joints was tested under low temperature. Glulam samples were glued {{with the three}} of the most common outdoor structural adhesives. The cold temperatures tested were 20, − 20, − 30, − 40, - 50 and − 60 °C. Within the temperature test range, the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> {{strength of}} the glulam joints was resistant to the effect of temperature. As the temperature decreased, the joints’ <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> strength did not show any significant change.

40|$|The {{penetration}} {{and performance}} of polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (pMDI) wood binder was investigated according to three factors: substrate species (aspen, yellow-poplar, or southern yellow pine); anatomical bonding plane (radial or tangential); and moisture content (0 %, 5 %, or 12 %). Compression <b>shear</b> <b>block</b> tests and fluorescence microscopy were used to examine bond performance and resin penetration. Statistically, each of the aforementioned factors impacted results. As moisture content increased, observed bond strengths and wood failure increased. Bond formation did not occur when the substrates were equilibrated to 0 % moisture content, except for the radial bonding surfaces of pine, which did adhere. At 5 and 12 % moisture contents, tangential bonding surfaces out-performed radial bonding surfaces. In terms of resin penetration, moisture content was clearly the most important variable. Little penetration was observed at 0 % moisture content, while extensive resin penetration was observed at elevated moisture contents.

These included four phenol–formaldehyde (PF) resins with high pH, one phenol–resorcinol–formaldehyde (PRF) resin with intermediate pH, two melamine–urea–formalde- hyde (MUF) resins, and two melamine–formaldehyde (MF) resins with low pH. The four curing methods {{used in the study}} were: (1) curing at 102 – 105 C for 1 h (based on CSA O 112. 6 - 1977), (2) four-hour curing at 66 C fol- lowed by 1 -hour curing at 150 C (based on ASTM D 1583 - 01), (3) curing at room temperature overnight (based on ASTM D 1583 - 01), and (4) cured adhesive squeezed out from glue lines of bonded <b>shear</b> <b>block</b> samples. The effect of the different methods on pH and alkalinity/acidity of the cured adhesive depended strongly on the individual adhesives. For the PF, the alkalinity was different for the different formulations in the liquid form, while in the cured form, the difference in the alkalinity depended on the curing method used. The MF and the MUF were the adhesives most affected by the method used.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{torsion test}} was {{evaluated}} {{as a method}} for determining the shear strength of full-size structural lumber. The evaluation involved an experimental length study, an experimental depth study, and a finite element study. The length study consisted of fifty nominal 2 x 4 specimens, ten specimens for each length, and ten American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) shear blocks. One 14 foot long board yielded one specimen for each length: (a) 21. 0 ", (b) 28. 5 ", (c) 32. 0 ", (d) 35. 5 ", (e) 39. 0 ", and (f) an ASTM D 143 - 94 <b>shear</b> <b>block.</b> The statistical analysis revealed {{no evidence that the}} length affected the shear strength. The depth study consisted of fifty specimens, ten specimens for each depth: (a) 2 x 4, (b) 2 x 6, (c) 2 x 8, (d) 2 x 10, and (e) 2 x 12. In addition, fifty ASTM shear blocks, one block for each specimen, were tested. The statistical study did not reveal convincing evidence of a depth effect on shear strength, even after accounting for specific gravity and shear span as covariates. Failure modes for the torsion samples involved a longitudinal shear crack at the mid-point of the longest side, which propagated toward the ends of the specimen and through the cross section perpendicular to the growth rings. The finite element model revealed that uniform shear stress occurs within the shear span, which begins and ends a distance of approximately two times the depth plus the grip distance away from each end of the member. In addition, torsion theory verified that the experimental shear failure plane that occurs within the shear span is parallel to the grain and the shear slippage is also parallel to the grain, similar to the known shear failure in specimens subjected to bending loads.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to adapt and evaluate a weak-post, W-beam guardrail system for use within mow strips and other pavements. The weak-post guardrail system was originally designed as the MGS bridge rail and has also been adapted for use on culverts. It was envisioned that the weak-post design would absorb the impact forces and prevent damage to the mow strips, thereby minimizing maintenance and repair costs. Evaluation of the weak posts in mow strips began with three rounds of dynamic bogie testing. Round 1 of bogie testing showed that 4 -in. (102 -mm) thick concrete would sustain only minor spalling from impacts to the posts. However, the posts would push through 4 -in. and 6 -in. (102 -mm and 152 -mm) thick asphalt mow strips. During Round 2, 24 -in. (610 -mm) long, 4 -in. x 4 -in. (102 -mm x 102 -mm) sockets with 10 -in. x 9 -in (254 -mm x 229 -mm) shear plates were utilized to better distribute the impact load to the asphalt pavement and prevent damage. However, Round 3 of bogie testing consisted of dual-post impacts, and the asphalt suffered from <b>shear</b> <b>block</b> fracture between the two 24 -in. (610 -mm) sockets and the back edge of the mow strip. A dual-post test within a 4 -in. (102 -mm) thick concrete pad showed only minor spalling. A full-scale MASH 3 - 11 test was conducted on the weak-post guardrail system installed within an asphalt mow strip. Due to the Round 3 testing results, the asphalt thickness was increased to 6 in.

Unfortunately, the asphalt fractured, and a 2 ó-in. (64 -mm) wide crack ran from socket to socket throughout the impact region of the system. Therefore, the weak-post guardrail system was crashworthy, but would require repairs in its current configuration.

40|$|Under loading {{conditions}} {{found in many}} geotechnical structures, {{it is common to}} observe failure in zones of high localized strain called shear bands. Existing models predict these localizations, but provide little insight into the micromechanics within the shear bands. This research captures the variation in microstructure inside and outside of shear bands that were formed in laboratory plane strain and two-dimensional discrete element method (DEM) biaxial compression experiments. 	Plane strain compression tests were conducted on dry specimens of Ottawa 20 - 30 sand to calibrate the device, assess global response repeatability, and develop a procedure to quantitatively define the onset of localization. A new methodology was employed to quantify and correct for the additional stresses imparted by the confining membrane {{in the vicinity of the}} shear band. Unsheared and sheared specimens of varying dilatancy were solidified using a two-stage resin impregnation procedure. DEM tests were performed using an innovative servo-controlled flexible lateral confinement algorithm to provide additional insights into laboratory results. 	The solidified specimens were sectioned and the resulting surfaces prepared for microstructure observation using bright field microscopy and morphological analysis. Local void ratio distributions and their statistical properties were determined and compared. Microstructural parameters for subregions in a grid pattern and along predefined inclined zones were also calculated. Virtual surfaces parallel to the shear band were identified and their roughnesses assessed. Similar calculations were performed on the DEM simulations at varying strain levels to characterize the evolution of microstructure with increasing strain. 	The various observations showed that the mean, standard deviation, and entropy of the local void ratio distributions all increased with increasing strain levels, particularly within regions of high local strains. These results indicate that disorder increases within a shear band and that the soil within the shear band does not adhere to the classical concept of critical state, but reaches a terminal void ratio that is largely a function of initial void ratio. Furthermore, there appears to be a transition zone between the far field and the fully formed <b>shear</b> <b>block,</b> as opposed to an abrupt delineation as traditionally inferred. Ph. D.

40|$|Canadian {{hard rock}} mine {{extraction}} practices have commonly created shallow stopes, 12 % {{of which have}} caved to surface, from instabilities originating from stope hangingwalls, crowns or footwalls. To date, however, mine operators have applied few of the available data gathering and design tools {{to strike a balance}} between maximum economic excavation dimension and stope viability. The preference has been to use personal mining experience. Several common rock mass environments are surveyed as well as the various ways in which shallow stopes have failed. It has been found that these rock masses develop gravity-induced movement in the form of plug failures, ravelling of rock blocks, strata failures, chimneying disintegration, and rock mass block caving. New failure-specific analytical equations are developed here for these common failure mechanisms. They address the mechanics of the failure process and incorporate the capability to arrive at the ultimate failure outline, for comparison to the location of the bedrock surface. This research has shown that: plug failures occur along steep, uninterrupted discontinuities bounding large blocks. Plug failure potential reduces substantially with confining compressive stress, discontinuity inclination, the absence of low friction surfaces and shearing of intact rock interrupting the discontinuity. Ravelling requires little peripheral confining stress for stabilization and prevention of block falls or slides. However, inherent conditions such as shallow dipping or vertically dipping joints can cause block falls to develop to surface. Low confining stresses, resulting from multiple stope extraction in orthogonal horizontal directions, would offer conditions suitable for plug and ravelling failures. Strata failures are caused by excessive stope spans, but the limited loading received from above strata is such, that the failure cavity created is of limited vertical extent, some 25 % of the stope width. Chimneying disintegration occurs in weak rock masses with low cohesion, over narrow openings that can be as deep as 275 m. The onset of chimneying disintegration can be created by compressive stresses, but develops as a result of mobilization of the rock mass by gravity in active <b>shear.</b> <b>Block</b> caving requires large spans to develop, and stabilizing could be overcome from arching stresses overcoming bulk arching strength. Controlling instability elements are tabulated for these failure mechanisms. A limit equilibrium correlation between span and cohesion for chimneying disintegration is presented, and the controlling limits between the occurrence of chimneying disintegration and block caving is discussed. Ravelling and chimneying disintegration are the most expected failure mechanisms for shallow stopes of hard rock mines. Although failure of the shallow stope may start around its periphery, stope failure to surface would likely occur in or close to the surface crown pillar. Although the analytical equations developed require input of in situ stresses defined by numerical modelling in order to yield a precise answer, conventional numerical modelling or empirical methods are shown to be unable to predict stope failures as the analytical equations have. A step-by-step stability analysis procedure is presented, incorporating rockmass environment, expected failure mechanism(s), and applicable data gathering and anlytical methods.

A load was applied at a speed of 1  mm/min using the universal testing machine, and the maximum load and wood failure percentage were recorded. The test for durability of the bonded interface was conducted using the delamination test. The 3 -ply assembly was cross-sectionally cut to a length of 75  mm for the delamination test. The delamination test {{took the form of}} two types of test, which were a cyclic-boiling and a cyclic-dipping test. A total of eight specimens were prepared from the assembly made from each group of lamina for both cyclic-boiling and cyclic-dipping test. The method used for the cyclic-boiling test has two cycles. In each cycle, the specimen was immersed in boiling water for 5  h and then cooled in water at a temperature of 25  °C for 1  h. After that the specimen was dried at a temperature of 70  °C until its weight reached 100 – 110  % of its initial weight. The ratio of delamination to bonded interface length was then calculated. Like the cyclic-boiling test, the cyclic-dipping test also has two cycles. In each cycle, the specimen was immersed in water at a temperature of 25  °C for 24  h. After that the specimen was dried at a temperature of 70  °C until the weight of the specimen reached 100 – 110  % of its initial weight. The ratio of delamination to bonded interface length was then calculated.|$|E
40|$|Percutaneous {{epidural}} neuroplasty {{with various}} catheters, {{such as the}} Racz catheter, navigation catheter, and so on, has been used widely. These procedures are intended to reduce scar formation, fibrous adhesion and inflammation in patients with neck and low back pain. Racz neuroplasty is a specifically de-signed procedure for lysis of adhesion with hypertonic saline. A wire-embedded catheter with a fine sheath coated around the wires is specially designed for this procedure. Many complications are reportedly related to these catheters. Some immediate complications include hypotension, bleeding in the epidural space, bending of the needle tip, penetration of the dura, subdural insertion, catheter <b>shearing,</b> <b>blocking</b> of the catheter and problems during withdrawal of the catheter. Late complications are penetration of the dura, numbness, temporary and permanent paresthesia, bowel and bladder dysfunction...|$|R

The influence of wood species, lay-ups, and clamping pressure for curing adhesives on RS strength was also investigated. Zhou et al.

[15] conducted torque loading tests on CLT <b>shear</b> <b>blocks</b> in which the cross layers were processed to have an annular cross section to facilitate RS failure mechanism. Li and Lam [16] studied RS damage accumulation and duration of load effect on CLT using low cycle fatigue bending tests and a stress-based damage accumulation model.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{research}} previously {{conducted at the}} University of Wollongong on <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> failure of bolted connections in cold-reduced steel sheets with low ductility to hot-rolled steel plates. It examines {{the applicability of the}} basic approach employed for cold-reduced sheet steel bolted connections, which makes use of the so-called active shear planes, to hot-rolled steel plate connections. The active shear planes lie midway between the gross and the net shear planes defined in the steel structures specifications. The paper shows that shear yielding leading to the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> failure of a bolted connection in a hot-rolled steel gusset plate is typically accompanied by full strain hardening. The paper proposes a design equation that provides more accurate and consistent results compared to the American, Australian, Canadian and European code equations in determining the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacities of bolted connections in hot-rolled steel gusset plates. A resistance factor of 0. 85 is recommended in order to achieve a target reliability index of 4. 0 or greater...|$|R
40|$|The {{ends of a}} coped beam are {{commonly}} connected to the web of a girder by double clip angles. The clip angles may either be bolted or welded to the web of the beam. One of the potential modes {{for the failure of}} the clip angle connection is the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> of the beam web material. To investigate the strength and the behavior of the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> of coped beams with welded end connections, ten full-scale coped beam tests were conducted. The test parameters included the aspect ratio of the clip angles, the web shear and tension area around the clip angles, the web thickness, beam section depth, cope length, and connection position. The test results indicated that the specimens failed, developing either tension fractures of the web {{near the bottom of the}} clip angles or local web buckling near the end of the cope. Although the final failure mode of the six specimens was local web buckling, it was observed during the tests that these specimens exhibited a significant deformation of the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> type prior to reaching their final failure mode. No shear fracture was observed in all of the tests. A comparison between the ultimate loads in the test and the predictions using the current design equations indicates that the current design standards such as the AISC-LRFD, CSA-S 16 - 01, Eurocode 3, BS 5950 - 1 : 2000, AIJ and GB 50017, are inconsistent in predicting the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> strength of coped beams with welded end connections. The analytical study of the strength of the test specimens using the finite element method, a parametric study, and a proposed design model for designing <b>block</b> <b>shears</b> for coped beams with welded clip angles are included in a companion paper.

40|$|Finite Element {{simulations}} of rubbers and biological soft tissue usually {{assume that the}} material being deformed is slightly compress-ible. It is shown here that in shearing deformations the corresponding normal stress distribution can exhibit extreme sensitivity to changes in Poisson’s ratio. These changes can even lead to {{a reversal of the}} usual Poynting effect. Therefore the usual practice of arbitrarily choosing a value of Poisson’s ratio when numerically modelling rubbers and soft tissue will, almost certainly, lead to {{a significant difference between the}} simulated and actual normal stresses in a <b>sheared</b> <b>block</b> because of the difference between the assumed and actual value of Poisson’s ratio. The worrying conclusion is that simulations based on arbitrar-ily specifying Poisson’s ratio close to 1 / 2 cannot accurately predict the normal stress distribution even for the simplest of shearing defor-mations. It is shown analytically that this sensitivity is due to the small volume changes which inevitably accompany all deformations of rubber-like materials. To minimise these effects, great care should be exercised to accurately determine Poisson’s ratio before simulations begin. 1 a...|$|R
50|$|On 23 March 2011, BOEMRE and the Coast Guard {{published}} the forensic examination report prepared by U.S. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) Columbus, the contractor that performed the examination. The report {{concluded that the}} primary cause of failure was that the blind shear rams failed to fully close and seal due to a portion of drill pipe trapped between the <b>shearing</b> <b>blocks.</b> This happened because the drill pipe elastically buckled within the wellbore due to forces induced on the drill pipe during loss of well control, consequently, drill pipe in process of shearing was deformed outside the shearing blade surfaces, and, consequently, the blind shearing rams were not able to move the entire pipe cross section into the shearing surfaces of the blades. Therefore, oil continued to flow through the drill pipe trapped between the ram block faces and subsequently through the gaps between the ram blocks. Since the pipe buckled when well control was lost, the blind shear rams would have failed to function as planned no matter when they were made active.|$|R
40|$|<b>Block</b> <b>shear</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} failure modes for coped steel I-beams. While focus of {{previous}} studies on the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of coped steel I-beam was mainly given to the connections with double clip angles, single-sided connections, which induce out-of-plane loading eccentricity, have not been adequately considered. Ten full-scale coped steel I-beam tests were conducted to examine the effects of two main test parameters, namely, out-of-plane loading eccentricity and web block aspect ratio (ratio of shear area to tension area). It was found that nine test specimens failed with tension fracture along the bottom bolt row of the web, and the remaining one failed in a whole block tear-out manner. Twisting of the web near the cope was observed for specimens with single-sided connection. More importantly, the test results showed that the out-of-plane loading eccentricity due to the single-sided connection did not have a detrimental effect on the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of the specimens. Moreover, increasing the connection rotational stiffness could increase the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity. These effects are further discussed via a finite element analysis and a preliminary parametric study. Finally, the test results are compared with four major design standards. It is found that the Canadian Standards CAN/CSA-S 16 - 09, which gives a test-to-predicted ratio ranged from 0. 93 to 1. 17, provided relatively good predictions for the specimens with single bolt line layout, while the predictions by other codes are too conservative. For those specimens with double bolt line layout, the capacities are underestimated by all the considered standards. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> of coped beams with a welded clip angle connection is presented in this paper. Twelve full-scale coped steel I-beam tests were conducted. The test parameters included the web block aspect ratio (height to width ratio of the web block connected to the clip angle) and the connection rotational stiffness. Out of the 12 test specimens, eight test specimens failed in <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> of the connection, namely, tensile fracture of the block width (the web underneath the clip angle) and shear yielding of the block height (the web along the vertical side of the clip angle). Two test specimens failed by local web buckling at the cope, one test specimen failed in the welds and the remaining one did not fail due to the limited capacity of the loading jack. The test results showed that in general the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of the test specimens increased with increasing web block aspect ratio and increasing connection rotational stiffness. The current design specifications (AISC-LRFD, CAN/CSA-S 16 - 09, CAN/CSA-S 16 - 01, BS EN 1993 - 1 - 8 - 2005, BS 5950 - 1 : 2000, and AIJ- 1990) provide conservative estimates of the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of the test specimens except for the specimen that had the smallest connection rotational stiffness. It {{should be noted that}} none of the design equations evaluated in this programme consider the influence of the web block aspect ratio and the connection rotational stiffness.
