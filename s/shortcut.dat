5|$|The {{only time}} the Red Line shared tracks with another line was from January 27, 1997 to September 17, 1999, when the Green Line Commuter <b>Shortcut</b> used Red Line tracks from Brookland–CUA to Farragut North. A short {{time after the}} Green Line branch north of Fort Totten opened in the early 1990s, the Green Line Commuter <b>Shortcut</b> began as a six-month experiment. Passengers could board the Green Line between Greenbelt and West Hyattsville and travel as far as Farragut North without having to transfer; the trains {{bypassed}} Fort Totten via a single-track spur between the West Hyattsville and Brookland–CUA stations. Due to its success, the <b>shortcut</b> continued until the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed in 1999.|$|E
5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, the Green Line Commuter <b>Shortcut</b> {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers {{to get on a}} train on the Green Line segment during rush hours and travel as far as Farragut North on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection) between the Green and Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This <b>shortcut</b> was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed.|$|E
5|$|The Mitsukue {{neighborhood}} prospered as a port town {{during the}} feudal period, {{as it was}} used as a port of rest for daimyōs on their way to and from the capital as part of the sankin-kōtai system.

5|$|A new State Route 231 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1988, {{connecting}} I-5 northwest of Irvine with SR 91, and in 1991 the south end was shifted southeast to the north end of SR 133, with the old route becoming SR 261. To prevent the route from changing numbers as it crossed I-5, the southern portion was renumbered SR 133 in 1996, with the remainder becoming an extended SR 241. The Eastern Transportation Corridor, which includes SR 133 north of I-5, was completed on October 15, 1998, opening a new <b>shortcut</b> from Orange County to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|All {{functions}} can {{be invoked}} by the mouse. Keys can also invoke the game setup, {{some of the}} menu options and some gameplay functions including scrolling and pausing the game. Players can select single units by clicking, and groups of up to four by shift-clicking or bandboxing. To move units, players can shift the mouse to select units on the main map, move to the unit menu to select an action, {{and then back to}} the main map or minimap to specify the target area; but <b>shortcut</b> keys can eliminate the middle mouse action in this cycle.|$|E

50|$|When <b>shortcuts</b> are {{referred}} to as key bindings it carries the connotation that the <b>shortcuts</b> are customizable to a user's preference and that program functions may be 'bound' to a different set of keystrokes instead of or in addition to the default. This highlights a difference in philosophy regarding <b>shortcuts.</b> Some systems, typically end-user-oriented systems such as Mac OS or Windows, consider standardized <b>shortcuts</b> essential to the environment's ease of use. These systems usually limit a user's ability to change <b>shortcuts,</b> possibly even requiring a separate or third-party utility to perform the task. Other systems, typically Unix and related, consider <b>shortcuts</b> to be a user's prerogative, and that they should be changeable to suit individual preference. In most real-world environments, both philosophies co-exist; a core set of sacred <b>shortcuts</b> remain fixed while others, typically involving an otherwise unused modifier key or keys, are under the user's control.|$|R
50|$|Most {{keyboard}} <b>shortcuts</b> {{require the}} user to press a single key or a sequence of keys one after the other. Other keyboard <b>shortcuts</b> require pressing and holding several keys simultaneously (indicated in the tables below by this sign: +). Keyboard <b>shortcuts</b> may depend on the keyboard layout (localization).|$|R
5|$|As {{part of the}} U.S. Highway system {{laid out}} in 1925 and {{finalized}} in late 1926, U.S. Route 410 connected Aberdeen with Clarkston, following the Olympic Highway (State Road 9) to Olympia, the Pacific Highway (State Road 1)—concurrent with US 99—to Tacoma, the National Park Highway System (State Road 5) to Yakima, and the Inland Empire Highway (State Road 3) to Clarkston. This differed from present US 12 between Elma and Naches in that it followed the route through Olympia and Tacoma rather than along the Cowlitz River. However, despite {{being part of the}} state highway system since 1897, US 410's crossing of the Cascades, the first between the Columbia River Gorge and Snoqualmie Pass, was not opened to traffic until 1931. A <b>shortcut</b> from near Packwood east across White Pass to Naches, very close to the original plan for the east half of State Road 5, was added to the state highway system in 1931 as another branch of the highway. The roadway between Packwood and Cayuse Pass, added to the state highway system on a different alignment in 1905, was finally completed in 1940, and the White Pass Highway was dedicated on August 12, 1951, opening a <b>shortcut</b> between southwest Washington and Yakima.|$|E
5|$|Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was {{significantly}} altered by {{the opening of}} the Gulf of California. Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5mya. The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional downwarping by taking a <b>shortcut</b> to the sea by flowing into the new gulf. This significantly decreased the distance from the river's headwaters and its delta at the sea. Water in the Colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper, creating the canyonland topography.|$|E

40|$|Keyboard <b>shortcuts</b> are {{generally}} accepted {{as the most}} efficient method for issuing commands, but previous {{research has suggested that}} many people do not use them. In this study we investigate the use of keyboard <b>shortcuts</b> further and explore reasons why they are underutilized by users. In Experiment 1, we establish two baseline findings: (1) people infrequently use keyboard <b>shortcuts</b> and (2) lack of knowledge of keyboard <b>shortcuts</b> cannot fully account for the low frequency of use. In Experiments 2 and 3, we furthermore establish that (3) even when put under time pressure users often fail to select those methods they themselves believe to be fastest and (4) the frequency of use of keyboard <b>shortcuts</b> can be increased by a tool that assists users learning keyboard <b>shortcuts.</b> We discuss how the theoretical notion of ‘satisficing’, adopted from economic and cognitive theory, can explain our results...|$|R
5|$|The Microsoft Malware Protection Center {{identified}} a trend away from WSF files {{in favor of}} LNK files and PowerShell scripting. These LNK <b>shortcut</b> files install Locky ransomware by automating infection operations {{rather than relying on}} traditional user downloads of WSF files—all of which is made possible by the universal PowerShell Windows application. Unfortunately, cyber criminals have been able to leverage PowerShell for their attacks for years. In a recent report, the application was found to be involved in nearly 40% of endpoint security incidents. While attackers have been finding weaknesses in the Windows operating system for years, it’s clear that there’s something problematic with PowerShell scripting.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} version of M-179 {{was established in}} 1935 as a <b>shortcut</b> near Le Roy between US131 and what was M-63. That route was turned back to local control in late 1958 or 1959, and the designation disappeared from the system. (The original M-63 itself was decommissioned {{a few years later}} in 1961.) On October 1, 1998, as part of the Rationalization process, a jurisdictional transfer turned county road A-42 between US131 and M-43 over to the state, which the state later designated as M-179 for the following year.|$|E

5|$|While NY32 officially remains {{concurrent}} with NY299 {{all the way}} to {{the traffic}} light at the northern terminus of NY208, a sign at the Elting Memorial Library, just before the center of downtown, directs northbound traffic on the highway down North Front Street. This <b>shortcut</b> allows that traffic to skip an often busy intersection and head out of the village on North Chestnut Street. Once past the village, the Ulster Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) building comes up on the west and the town hall along the east. NY32 then becomes mostly rural again.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} Native American groups {{inhabited}} {{the area from}} as early as 7000BC, most recently the Timbisha around 1000AD who migrated between winter camps in the valleys and summer grounds in the mountains. A group of European-Americans that became stuck in the valley in 1849 while looking for a <b>shortcut</b> to the gold fields of California gave the valley its name, even though only one of their group died there. Several short-lived boom towns sprang up during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to mine gold and silver. The only long-term profitable ore to be mined was borax, which was transported out of the valley with twenty-mule teams. The valley later {{became the subject of}} books, radio programs, television series, and movies. Tourism blossomed in the 1920s, when resorts were built around Stovepipe Wells and Furnace Creek. Death Valley National Monument was declared in 1933 and the park was substantially expanded and became a national park in 1994.|$|E

40|$|As the {{popularity}} of sending messages electronically increases, so does the necessity of conveying messages more efficiently. One way of increasing efficiency is to abbreviate words and expressions by combining letters with numbers such as gr 8 for “great,” using acronyms, such as lol for “laughing out loud,” or clippings such as msg for “message. ” The present study compares the processing of <b>shortcuts</b> to the processing of closely matched pseudo-shortcuts. ERPs were recorded while participants were performing a lexical decision task. Response times showed that <b>shortcuts</b> were categorized more slowly as nonwords than pseudo-shortcuts. The ERP results showed no differences between <b>shortcuts</b> and pseudo-shortcuts at time windows 50 – 150 ms and 150 – 270 ms, but {{there were significant differences}} between 270 and 500 ms. These results suggest that at early stages of word recognition, the orthographic and phonological processing is similar for <b>shortcuts</b> and pseudo-shortcuts.

40|$|Graphical {{interfaces}} allow {{users to}} issue commands using pull-down menus, icon toolbars, and keyboard <b>shortcuts.</b> Menus and icon toolbars {{are easier to}} learn, whereas keyboard <b>shortcuts</b> are more efficient. It would seem natural for users to migrate {{from the use of}} easy-to-learn menu and icon methods to the more efficient method of key-board <b>shortcuts</b> as they gain experience. To investigate the extent to which this transi-tion takes place, 251 experienced users of Microsoft Word were given a questionnaire assessing their choice of methods for the most frequently occurring commands. Con-trary to our expectations, most experienced users rarely used the efficient keyboard <b>shortcuts,</b> favoring the use of icon toolbars instead. A second study was done to verify that keyboard <b>shortcuts</b> are, indeed, the most efficient method. Six participants per-formed common commands using menu selection, icon toolbars, and keyboard short-cuts. The keyboard <b>shortcuts</b> were, as expected, the most efficient. We conclude that even experienced users are inefficient in their use of graphical interfaces. One possible way to improve user efficiency is for training programs to provide a roadmap for users to make the transition from using pull-down menus and clicking icon toolbars to issu-ing keyboard <b>shortcuts.</b> 1...|$|R
