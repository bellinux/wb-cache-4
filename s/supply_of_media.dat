40|$|Nowadays it {{has become}} quite natural for the doctors and {{scientists}} of the Charité to use the services of the Medical Library at their desktops. Therefore the library as a physical location can be adopted to better suit {{the needs of the}} students. This means, first of all, more space for the textbook and reference collections as well as more seats for reading and learning. However, learning media will also develop towards digital forms in the coming years.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{explores the}} library collaboration "HelGe-libraries" goals, guidelines {{and strategies for}} their resource sharing of library books and digital resources. The questions asked were: What does the resource sharing look like {{when it comes to}} media and services? What goals and guidelines do they have for the resource sharing? What common strategies do they have for the resource sharing? What challenges have they encountered with resource sharing and how have they dealt with them? The theoretical framework consists of Jennifer Rowleys theory of innovation strategies for libraries and Rosabeth Moss Kanters theory on the art of alliances. The method used to collect material was interviews and document analysis. Four informants were interviewed. My study concludes that the "HelGe-libraries" has formulated goals for their resource sharing and that the resource sharing is connected to their goals. The end result show that the main goal is to offer users a library service of high quality by offering a broad <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>media</b> and information. The study also showed that the collaboration is working along various guidelines and that common strategies, formal and informal, has been developed to achieve their goals and to improve service...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Peer-assisted Video-on-Demand (VoD) {{systems have}} not only {{received}} substantial recent research attention, but also been implemented and deployed with success in large-scale realworld streaming systems, such as PPLive [1]. Peer-assisted Videoon-Demand systems are designed {{to take full advantage}} of peer upload bandwidth contributions with a cache on each peer. Since the size of such a cache on each peer is limited, it is imperative that an appropriate cache replacement algorithm is designed. There exists a tremendous level of flexibility in the design space of such cache replacement algorithms, including the simplest alternatives such as Least Recently Used (LRU). Which algorithm is the best to minimize server bandwidth costs, so that when peers need a media segment, it is most likely available from caches of other peers? Such a question, however, is arguably non-trivial to answer, as both the demand and <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>media</b> segments are stochastic in nature. In this paper, we seek to construct an analytical framework based on optimal control theory and dynamic programming, to help us form an in-depth understanding of optimal strategies to design cache replacement algorithms. With such analytical insights, we have shown with extensive simulations that, the performance margin enjoyed by optimal strategies over the simplest algorithms is not substantial, when it comes to reducing server bandwidth costs. In most cases, the simplest choices are good enough as cache replacement algorithms in peer-assisted VoD systems. I...|$|E

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{fundamental}} question in monetary economics pertains {{to the role of}} the government in providing money. A widely held view among economists is that the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>media</b> of exchange is an activity that should not be left to the private sector. Indeed, even Milton Friedman, who in most respects has viewed the economic role of the government quite narrowly, argues in Friedman (1960) that the provision of money is fraught with peculiar market failures and that the government should have a monopoly in the supply and control of the stock of circulating currency. Monetary systems that include the private provision of circulating media of exchange were not uncommon in the past. In the United States, most of the stock of currency in circulation prior to the Civil War consisted of notes issued by state-chartered banks. The U. S. pre–Civil War monetary system has been judged by some, but not all, as chaotic (Rolnick et al. 1997; Rolnick and Weber 1983, 1984), since it included thousands of note-issuing banks and the quality of these notes was difficult to distinguish. Counterfeiting was a problem, and there was sometimes poor information on a particular bank’s chances of defaulting. However, the Suffolk Banking System in pre–Civil War New England is thought to have functioned quite efficiently (see Smith and Weber [1998]). In addition, the monetary system in place in Canada prior to 1935 featured private note issue by a small number of chartered banks, and this system also appears to have worked quite well (see Williamson [1999] and Champ, Smith, and Williamson [1996]). Private money systems are not just of historical interest. In the United States, the government monopoly on the issue of circulating media of exchang...|$|E

40|$|Establishment {{of fetal}} bovine serum (FBS) -free cell culture {{conditions}} is essential for transplantation therapies. Blood-derived endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) are potential candidates for regenerative medicine applications. ECFCs were isolated from term umbilical cord blood units and characterized by flow cytometry, capillary formation and responsiveness to cytokines. ECFCs were expanded under standard, FBS-containing endothelial medium, or transferred to chemically defined endothelial media without FBS. Microarray expression profiling was applied to compare the transcriptome profiles in FBS-containing versus FBS-free culture. ECFC outgrowth in standard medium was successful in 92 % of cord blood units. The karyotype of expanded ECFCs remained normal. Without FBS, ECFC initiation and expansion failed. Modest proliferation, changes in cell morphology and organization and cell death have been observed after passaging. Gene ontology analysis revealed a broad down-regulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression and up-regulation of genes involved in stress response and apoptosis. Interestingly, genes participating in lipid biosynthesis were markedly up-regulated. Detection of several endothelial cell-specific marker genes showed {{the maintenance of the}} endothelial cell characteristics during serum-free culture. Although ECFCs maintain their endothelial characteristics during serum-free culturing, they could not be expanded.

A {{cryostat}} vacuum tank, shaped like a torus, hosts 70 superconducting magnetic coils to produce a toroidal magnetic field that will confine a fusion relevant plasma. The cryostat tank has a volume of about 420 m 3 and is equipped with several hundreds of vacuum ports, feed-throughs and service openings. Nested inside the cryostat is the plasma vessel with a volume of about 80 m 3, also shaped like a torus. This plasma vessel is connected to the outside by 254 ports that traverse the cryostat.

The near endless <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> digital <b>media</b> outlets and information sources has created a new landscape at the interface of the student-professor relationship; incorporating these emergent platforms into hybrid educational environments can enhance student engagement with course material while improving communication between and amongst classmates, including the instructor. This new hyper-connected reality, however, presents both challenges and opportunities in educating tomorrow’s natural resource leaders and professors must “meet students where they are” by communicating and teaching in relatable ways (i. e. through emergent digital platforms). Students are increasingly being called upon to provide the “digital voice” for employers as new professionals, acquiring these requisite skills is now an essential component to a satisfactory education in the field of natural resources that must be met through adapting traditional classroom approaches. This presentation outlines the creation and use of a hybrid digital learning environment and provides a road map to start integrating various platforms into the classroom. Integrating digital media into traditional classroom dynamics can be difficult, confusing, and scary but also rewarding and beneficial. As such, the discussion answers two pertinent questions: how can natural resource educators utilize digital outlets to enhance the learning process? And, how can natural resource educators modify course requirements and expectations to better develop contemporary skill requirements? Considerations of privacy, content, digital lifespan, and communication are explicitly touched upon along with a review of current trends in the use <b>of</b> social <b>media</b> and other digital outlets amongst students and, increasingly, a wide variety of natural resource stakeholders (i. e. managers, environmental organizations, locals) ...|$|R

40|$|Current {{method of}} design and {{evaluation}} of interior lighting in buildings is pulverized to the solution of individual spaces. Separately is evaluated energy consumption for lighting in the building. In this situation {{is very difficult to}} optimize the lighting systems. The relationship between the needs for lighting and overall energy consumption for lighting is not obvious. Clearer connection {{can be found in the}} simplified view of the whole issue. The required lighting levels and thus energy consumption in buildings are affected by three basic aspects. The first aspect is the usage of the building, i. e. what types of visual tasks in a building are exercised. The basic parameter for quantitative evaluation of visual requirements in today's practice is the illuminance E (Ix). The second aspect is the size of the building, thus the dimensions of spaces in which the visual tasks are performed. In this case the basic parameter is the illuminated area A (m 2). The last aspect is the time during which the visual tasks are performed, expressed by operating time T (h). In this view the issue of the interior lighting in buildings can be converted to the delivery of luminous flux Φ (lm) or quantity of light QV (lm. h / year). Such expression is conceptually close to requirements for the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> other <b>media</b> to the buildings, such as heat, air, water etc. The above considerations set the desired amount of luminous flux, respectively quantity of light. The next step is to set lighting quality parameters such as a minimum proportion of daylight, uniformity, limitation of the glare, the colour properties of light. In the last step, the optimal technical solution is found by selecting the type of lighting systems, light sources and luminaires, which meets both quantitative and qualitative requirements of lighting. Such approaches allow the creation of ideas about lighting needs in the initial stages of project and convert them to specific technical solutions...|$|R

Each of these techniques is available to construct a simple microfluidic 3 D environment, however, {{it is difficult to}} obtain multiple criteria such as complex geometry, mechanical property, biocompatibility, usability and durability, which are crucial to the cell culture environment in a microfluidic system. Although the trapped cells can be easily applied for the facile <b>supply</b> and retrieval <b>of</b> <b>media,</b> reagents, and other chemicals, the lack of extracellular matrix that is indispensable for binding, interaction, and proliferation of cells causes a different behavior of the cultured cell compared with in vivo state. Meanwhile, complex multi-step fabrication processes are generally required to construct 3 D structures based on scaffold made of natural/synthetic hydrogel. In addition, structures and functions of hydrogel scaffolds are limited due to intrinsic characteristics of hydrogel materials. To obtain better mechanical properties, there is a certain loss of biocompatibility, and vice versa. Thus, a new method is needed to develop a new model {{for the construction of a}} 3 D environment to overcome these limitations.|$|R

This paper investigates the wellness phenomenon {{in the specific context}} <b>of</b> <b>media</b> consumption. While motives <b>of</b> <b>media</b> consumption in general have been widely studied in communication research, wellness themed media content has not yet received much academic attention. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the motives that drive the consumption <b>of</b> wellness themed <b>media</b> content, and to identify distinct consumer groups based on these motives. Further, this study seeks to examine the relation between the different motives <b>of</b> wellness <b>media</b> consumption and consumers' wellness orientation. The theoretical background of the research subject is drawn from the extant literature on the uses & gratifications <b>of</b> <b>media</b> consumption, the relation between media consumption and health in general, and wellness orientation. Data was collected using a web-based survey, during fall 2014. Invitation to the questionnaire was sent to the target group, which was active Finnish speaking consumers <b>of</b> wellness <b>media,</b> and altogether 224 completed responses were received. The data was then analyzed using two primary multivariate data analysis techniques: factor analysis and cluster analysis. Factor analysis was first applied to identify underlying structures within the motives <b>of</b> wellness <b>media</b> consumption, and to prepare the data for cluster analysis. Next, cluster analysis was used to identify consumer groups based on their wellness media consumption motives. To further examine the differences in wellness orientation between the clusters, analysis of variance was applied. Three main motives <b>of</b> wellness <b>media</b> consumption are proposed by the results: Information & Learning, Social Integration & Interaction, and Entertainment. Further, four consumer groups <b>of</b> wellness <b>media</b> are identified: Socially motivated consumers, Entertainment-seekers, Indifferent consumers and Information oriented consumers. As for the relation between the motives and wellness orientation, the findings indicate that social and information motives would be more strongly associated with higher wellness orientation than entertainment motives. The main contribution of this paper is in adding to the understanding of consumer behavior in the context <b>of</b> wellness <b>media</b> consumption. While offering valuable insight to the research subject, the findings also indicate that further research is needed in order to fully understand the motives <b>of</b> wellness <b>media</b> consumption and their relation to wellness orientation...|$|R

This research describes the development and functional testing of novel 3 -dimensional bioengineered smooth muscle tissues in vitro {{and the development of a}} micro-perfusion system to support culture and enhance functionality of bioengineered tissues. All bioengineered tissue models described here were developed utilizing a fibrin biomaterial, which is well-suited for bioengineering contractile tissues. We developed ring-shaped models of rat sphincter and colonic smooth muscle tissue as well as a strip model of human aortic vascular smooth muscle tissue. Functional testing of the contractile properties of bioengineered muscle tissues was accomplished using a custom build force transducer. Bioengineered tissues exhibited striking tissue-specific functionality, which was similar to smooth muscle in vivo, including the generation of spontaneous basal tone and agonist-induced contraction and relaxation, which was calcium-dependent and calcium-independent (respectively). Finally, in order to support the increased metabolic demands of bioengineered tissues, we designed and fabricated a novel micro-perfusion system to promote delivery <b>of</b> a constant <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> oxygenated <b>media</b> to bioengineered tissues. We tested the compatibility of our micro-perfusion system with Bioengineered Heart Muscle (BEHM) and found that the system is capable of supporting viability (mitochondrial activity, total protein, total RNA) and maintaining contractile properties (twitch force, specific force, electrical pacing, and expression of contractile proteins) of bioengineered tissues. In addition, short-term exposure of BEHMs to micro-perfusion resulted in some functional improvement. This research specifically adds to the knowledge base of two critical areas in tissue engineering research: 1) the development of functional bioengineered models, and 2) ancillary technology to support these models. Collectively, this research bridges several scientific and technological gaps in the field of functional tissue engineering...|$|R
