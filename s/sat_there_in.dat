25|$|The Royal Navy {{took her}} into service as HMS Arrogante. She arrived at Plymouth in April 1798 and she <b>sat</b> <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> August, the Navy renamed her HMS Insolent, {{but did not}} refit her until February to April 1801. On 24 April Lieutenant Burians, a veteran officer, {{commissioned}} her.|$|E
2500|$|... "She [...] called Bouzes {{suddenly}} {{into the}} woman's apartment {{as if to}} communicate to him something very important. Now there was a suite of rooms in the Palace, below the ground level, secure and a veritable labyrinth, so {{that it seemed to}} resemble Tartarus, where she usually kept in confinement those who had given offence. So Bouzes was hurled into this pit, and in that place he, a man sprung from a line of consuls, remained, forever unaware of time. For as he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the darkness, he could [...] distinguish whether it was day or night, nor could he communicate with any other person. For the man who threw him his food for each day met him in silence, one as dumb as the other, as one beast meets another. And straightway it was supposed by all that he had died, but no one dared mention or recall him. But two years and four months later she was moved to pity and released the man, and he was seen by all as one who had returned from the dead. But thereafter he always suffered from weak sight and his whole body was sickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1918, Redbird Smith {{died at the}} age of 68. On the day of Redbird Smith's funeral, a {{large white}} crane flew from the east at sun rise and lit in a tree next to the stomp ground. According to John Smith, the most {{influential}} Nighthawk leader among Redbird Smith's sons, [...] "We were up in the stomp ground fixing to have services for my father when this crane was sitting in the tree near the stomp ground. C.P. Cornelius said, 'You watch and see if that crane isn't down by the graveyard when we bury your father.' [...] Pretty soon the crane flew off and lit in a tree just west of the graveyard. When we carried my father's coffin down to the graveyard, the crane <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> that tree and hollered. After we buried my father, the crane sat there until sundown and then flew off to the west." [...] This event was reported by the Cherokee as an omen, for a crane is very wild and hardly ever can one approach within fifty yards of it without flying away.|$|E
60|$|To {{look at them}} as they <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> spoon <b>in</b> hand, over a pan of burgout, {{one would}} not readily have guessed the drift of their conversation.|$|R
60|$|It did {{begin to}} rain, {{the only one}} of my suppositions which came true. I hoisted an {{umbrella}} and <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> grimly, <b>in</b> that horseless wagon in the mud-hole.|$|R
60|$|As he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> Herman came <b>in,</b> his keen eyes {{seeking out}} every stain and {{evidence}} of vandalism.|$|R
60|$|All who <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> Twilight Land laughed, {{and even}} Patient Grizzle smiled.|$|E
60|$|She nodded, {{and they}} <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> silence for several moments. Bellamy was {{thinking}} deeply.|$|E
60|$|As he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> gloomy thought, Barret chanced {{to raise}} his eyes, and {{observed}} the bird high above him--far out of gunshot.|$|E
6000|$|His {{hands in}} his pockets and his legs much apart, Mitchy <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> as <b>in</b> a posture adapted to her simplicity. [...] "You're adorable. YOU don't. But it IS rather horrid, isn't it?" [...] he {{presently}} went on.|$|R
60|$|Vivid in {{my memory}} is {{the picture of the}} last night as we <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> talking <b>in</b> low tones of the strange romance which had woven our lives {{together}} and of this wonder which was coming to augment our happiness and fulfill our hopes.|$|R
60|$|What Nicholas Snyders, recalling {{all things}} afterwards, could never {{understand}} was why he <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> listening <b>in</b> patience to the stranger's talk; for, at the time, {{it seemed to him}} the jesting of a wandering fool. But something about the stranger had impressed him.|$|R
60|$|There was no response. He flushed to {{the temples}} but {{forced himself to}} {{maintain}} silence. He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> this uncomfortable stillness some time, then {{got up and went}} out.|$|E
60|$|For {{some time}} {{the two friends}} <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> silence, meditating {{as to what they}} should do in the circumstances, for each felt that action of some sort was {{absolutely}} necessary.|$|E
6000|$|... "But he did. He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{that very}} chair, {{and talked to}} me in a manner that nobody ever did before, certainly. What a fine old man he is, and how handsome!" ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> till {{darkness}} {{came into}} his room. He did not replenish the coal in the stove that leered {{at him from the}} two broken doors in front, and seemed to face him with a crazy, drunken reel on its mis-matched legs. He was hungry, but he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> enjoying <b>in</b> a morbid way the pang of hunger. It helped him someway to bear the sting of his defeat.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{will you}} do now, Kea?" [...] I asked the poor girl, as she <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> trembling, <b>in</b> a small cabin chair, while the red flames still illumined for miles and miles the summit and flanks of Mauna Loa. [...] "Do you wish to stop here in your own island?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{turned to}} the drawer in which I had espied the rough monks' habits, and pulling one out I held it for her to don. She <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> now, <b>in</b> that garment of coarse black cloth, the cowl flung back upon her shoulder, the fairest {{postulate}} that ever entered upon a novitiate.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the dark, the moon through the {{skylight}} above laying a pale smear which lengthened slowly towards him down the stairway. He tried to be philosophical.|$|E
60|$|The youth went pale. He hated these words. But he {{was like}} a gleaming, bright pebble, {{something}} bright and inalterable. He did not think. He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> his hard brightness, and did not speak.|$|E
60|$|So they <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{great joy}} and {{friendliness}} of spirit, and, for the while, Sir Tristram forgot the mission he was upon and was happy in heart and glad of that terrible storm that had driven him thitherward.|$|E
60|$|At first Bremner {{watched the}} rising tide, {{and as he}} <b>sat</b> up <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the dark he felt himself dreadfully forsaken and desolate, and began to comment on things in general to his dog, by way of {{inducing}} a more sociable and cheery state of mind.|$|R
60|$|BLADES. A {{few years}} ago, ma'am, <b>there</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> this room a scrubby, inky little boy--I was that boy.|$|R
6000|$|As he <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> solitary <b>in</b> his bedroom, {{his hands}} dropped down by his side, his pipe hung {{from his mouth}} on to his breast, and his eyes, turned up to the ceiling, were lighted almost with inspiration. Men there at the congress, Mr. Chaffanbrass, young Staveley, Felix Graham, and others, had {{regarded}} him as an impersonation of dullness; but through his mind and brain, as he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> wrapped <b>in</b> his old dressing-gown, there ran thoughts which seemed to lift him lightly from the earth into an elysium of justice and mercy. And {{at the end of}} this elysium, which was not wild in its beauty, but trim and orderly in its gracefulness,--as might be a beer-garden at Munich,--there stood among flowers and vases a pedestal, grand above all other pedestals in that garden; and on this there was a bust with an inscription:--"To Von Bauhr, who reformed the laws of nations." ...|$|R
60|$|They <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{silence for}} a few moments. A promenading couple put their heads behind the screen, and withdrew {{with the sound of}} {{feminine}} giggling. Outside, the piano was being thumped to the tune of a popular polka.|$|E
6000|$|Vile hall {{the other}} {{passengers}} vent upon their vays, [...] The Capting and the Doctor <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> a maze; [...] Some vent in a Homminibus, some vent in a Cabby, [...] The Capting and the Doctor vaited vith the babby.|$|E
60|$|But Asad did not respond. He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{a gloomy}} abstraction, staring {{straight}} before him. At last he sighed wearily. He was just, {{and he had}} a conscience, as odd a thing as it was awkward in a corsair Basha.|$|E
50|$|Hansen, Schou & Weller was a {{photographic}} studio in Copenhagen. Many celebrities <b>sat</b> for portraits <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{the last decades}} of the 19th century.|$|R
6000|$|... [Sidenote: Sir Tristram sings before King Arthur] Sir Tristram {{took the}} harp {{in his hands}} and tuned it and struck upon it. And he played upon the harp, and he sang to the music thereof so wonderfully that they who <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> listened <b>in</b> silence as though they were without breath. For not one of them had ever heard such singing as that music which Sir Tristram sang; for it was as though some angel were singing to those who <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> harkening to his chanting.|$|R
60|$|I {{reached the}} museum and found it brilliantly lit, but empty except for the cheerful company of the two mummies who also {{appeared}} to regard me with gleaming but doubtful eyes. So I <b>sat</b> down <b>there</b> <b>in</b> front of the fire, not even daring to smoke lest tobacco should complicate Taduki.|$|R
60|$|A short {{month ago}} {{we would have}} repudiated Bones; today we <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{slightly}} supercilious attitudes, as if to indicate that any affront offered to Bones would be an insult to ourselves, and followed by our instantaneous withdrawal in a body.|$|E
60|$|He took a cigar {{from the}} box and {{lighting}} it carefully quitted the room. His cousin waited until the door had closed behind him, and then turning to the window <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> a fit of fury as silent as it was terrible.|$|E
60|$|In his inflamed, overwrought exasperation, {{he stopped}} the car, and they <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of the}} country lane, to have it out. It was a crisis of war between them, so they did not see the ridiculousness of their situation.|$|E
6000|$|But {{it did not}} please HIM at all. The {{moment of}} disgrace seemed at hand, for {{he had no idea}} how to make this pasty. He went to his rooms very sad. As he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> lost <b>in</b> thought the goose Mimi, who was left free to walk about, came up to him and asked what was the matter? When she heard she said: ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> long <b>in</b> my misery, {{thinking}} {{it over to}} myself. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't go and confide to Aunt Emma's ear this new and horrible doubt,--which was no doubt after all, for I KNEW it was impossible. I hated Jane for suggesting it; I hated her for telling me. Yet I couldn't be left alone. I was far too terrified.|$|R
60|$|The airs {{the skipper}} gave 'imself was sickening. He <b>sat</b> down <b>there</b> <b>in</b> 'is miserable little rat-'ole of a cabin and {{acted as if}} 'e was a judge and I was a prisoner. Most of the 'ands 'ad {{squeezed}} <b>in</b> <b>there</b> too, and the things they advised George to do to me was remarkable.|$|R
