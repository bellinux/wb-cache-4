A large number of advanced batteries with higher power and energy densities are connected in series or parallels to provide required power and energy for EVs.

40|$|Frequency Containment {{reserves}} (FCR), previously called primary reserves, are {{an important}} feature insuring <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>operations</b> of the Continental Europe grid. Due to their strong technical requirements, gas and hydro power plants are the almost exclusive provider of FCR. Since gas power plants are becoming less profitable in Europe, a lot of efforts are deployed into FCR diversification. This paper assesses the potential for battery energy storage systems (BESS) to deliver FCR combined with a slow-moving thermal power plant and other emergency solutions such as load shedding and dissipating resistances. A proportional-integral energy management control loop is used whose parameters are tuned by an economic evaluation. We show that economic opportunity already exists today. Some limitations are discussed due to simplifying assumptions. The best solution consists of a 1 MW/ 1. 4 MWh battery and a 0. 09 MW power plant per MW of provided FCR reducing by 90 % the reservation on power plants.
