40|$|A {{formalism}} {{is introduced}} {{to describe the}} dependence of the EXAFS amplitude and phase on thermally excited vibrations. The EXAFS expression for a general three‐atom system of C_s symmetry is discussed in detail. To lowest order, thermal vibrations induce a change only in the <b>scattering</b> <b>path</b> length and give rise to the standard EXAFS expression for each <b>scattering</b> <b>path</b> damped by the appropriate Debye‐Waller factor. A change in scattering angle, however, is a higher order effect and gives rise to additional EXAFS terms called modification factors. There is a modification factor associated with each multiple <b>scattering</b> <b>path.</b> Within this formalism, the correlation which exists between a change in <b>scattering</b> <b>path</b> length and a change in scattering angle is explicitly calculated. The normal modes which contribute to the modification factors are discussed, and shown {{to be dependent on}} the symmetry of the system. The nature and temperature dependence of the Debye–Waller and modification factors for the three‐atom system Br_ 2 O are discussed as a function of bridging angle. The modification factors are shown to make a small contribution to the total EXAFS of the system. The magnitude of this contribution is dependent on the degree of correlation that exists between changes in <b>scattering</b> <b>path</b> length and scattering angle...|$|E
40|$|Morlet wavelet {{transformation}} {{was used}} to analyze the Co K -edge extended x-ray absorption spectrum of La 0. 5 Ca 0. 5 CoO 3 −δ. Due to recent success in wavelet analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data we hoped that the Co–La <b>scattering</b> <b>path</b> could be separated from the Co–Ca <b>scattering</b> <b>path</b> in the EXAFS spectrum of La 0. 5 Ca 0. 5 CoO 3 −δ. The result showed a certain resolution of the wavelet transformed spectrum in the k space. Using theoretical scattering functions of the individual scattering paths calculated with ab initio multiple scattering codes (FEFF), it was possible to assign some maxima in the wavelet transformation EXAFS spectrum. The Co–La <b>scattering</b> <b>path</b> could be identified, but no additional information about the Co–Ca scattering function was obtained. A detailed analysis of the theoretical Co–La and Co–Ca scattering functions revealed that the two scattering functions overlap considerably in k space and have almost the same frequency. Morlet wavelet transformation of the sum of the two theoretical scattering functions did not allow a satisfactory separation of the two scattering functions. This separation is probably only possible with wavelets, which mimic the fundamental properties of the real scattering function more accurately...|$|E
40|$|The {{form of the}} Debye–Waller {{factor in}} EXAFS is {{discussed}} in detail, and an expression is obtained for this factor in a general three‐atom system of C_s symmetry.

A series of model three‐atom systems with C_(2 v) symmetry are studied and the Debye–Waller factors {{as a function of}} the bridging angle are discussed for each of these systems. The temperature dependence of the Debye‐Waller factor for each <b>scattering</b> <b>path</b> is also studied. In a system of C_(2 v) symmetry, approximating the double and triple scattering Debye–Waller factors by the second shell single scattering factor is shown to be strictly valid only for a system close to linearity. The error due to this approximation is dependent upon the amplitude of the individual scattering paths and is shown to increase with temperature. When the single scattering contribution is unimportant, there is shown to exist a temperature where the above approximation is exact...|$|E

30|$|The {{usefulness}} of the effective CFR obtained by (16) may be noted as follows. Thus far, we have assumed that the direct path exists and all paths also have distinctive delays. However, paths can actually have indistinguishable delays. Then, a problem could arise when some <b>scattered</b> <b>paths</b> of considerable amplitudes have delays close to the delay of the direct path, while they also have AOAs considerably {{different from that of}} the direct path. In this case, the effective CFR will possibly contain also the AOA information of the <b>scattered</b> <b>paths</b> that can degrade the location estimation of the proposed algorithm. Therefore, the proposed algorithm requires significant <b>scattered</b> <b>paths</b> with delays close to the delay of the direct path to also have AOAs close to the AOA of the direct path. This could be realistic if the placement of the AP antenna array is not close to any significant reflective materials. Such placement also seems to be a good practice for other AOA-based localization systems.|$|R

A complete description of the EXAFS signal up to the third shell of nearest neighbours for both c-Ge and Ge NCs is only achieved by including at least two double scattering and one triple <b>scattering</b> <b>path.</b> Unlike reports for bulk semiconductors and Ge-Si quantum dots, our results show that including only the most prominent double <b>scattering</b> <b>path</b> is insufficient for accurately ascertaining the structural parameters of the second and third shells, leading to unphysically small coordination numbers for the NCs. The same is observed when no multiple scattering paths are taken into account.

40|$|Raman {{heterodyne}} detection of {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} is a sensitive technique for optical detection of an NMR transition, which is driven by a resonant radio-frequency field. The observed signal is linear in the transition matrix elements of the magnetic resonance transition and two optical transitions. This linearity {{is the reason that}} signal contributions from different sites or different rf transitions can interfere, in many cases destructively. In this article, we discuss such an interference effect, which appears to have been overlooked in the past. It occurs between signal contributions that originate from the same magnetic resonance transition of atoms with different positions within the inhomogeneously broadened optical resonance line. These atoms contribute to the coherent Raman scattering through different <b>scattering</b> <b>paths,</b> which involve optical transitions to different nuclear spin states of the same electronic state. We show that the interference between all possible <b>scattering</b> <b>paths</b> leads to complete signal cancellation, if the atoms that are involved in the different <b>scattering</b> <b>paths</b> are equally polarized. To study the effect and to eliminate the interference, we used a pump-and-probe technique with two laser beams. With two independent laser frequencies, it becomes possible to separate the individual <b>scattering</b> <b>paths.</b> We calculate the dependence of the signal on the frequency of both laser beams {{as well as on the}} radio frequency and compare the results to experimental data from Pr 3 +:YAlO 3.

30|$|A new {{localization}} method {{based on}} an asynchronous network of MIMO-OFDM access points was proposed. This method can be implemented on WLANs of a current standard without affecting their protocol structures.

The proposed method does not require a training process for adaptation to ever-changing environments. The availability of direct paths is sufficient for triangulation, as in the ultrawideband-based localization regime. Further, significant <b>scattered</b> <b>paths</b> with delays close to the delay of the direct path are required to have AOAs close to the AOA of the direct path.|$|R

40|$|An {{appraisal}} of the optical properties of the AVHRR is made for a proposed orbital trajectory which results in an unexpected solar stray-light path; i. e., bypassing the external scan mirror and Cassegrain telescope and proceeding directly to the inner conical baffle. This stray-light path is directed onto an internal beamsplitter which, in turn, is directly observed by the detectors. Stray-light analysis, as a goal, seeks to remove or minimize the influence of such critical scattering paths. The AVHRR path is evaluated using a standard optical ray-tracing program, ACCOS V.

40|$|We {{consider}} Dirac quasi-particles, as {{realized with}} cold atoms loaded in a honeycomb lattice or in a π-flux square lattice, {{in the presence}} of a weak correlated disorder such that the disorder fluctuations do not couple the two Dirac points of the lattices. We numerically and theoretically investigate the time evolution of the momentum distribution of such quasi-particles when they are initially prepared in a quasi-monochromatic wave packet with a given mean momentum. The parallel transport of the pseudo-spin degree of freedom along <b>scattering</b> <b>paths</b> in momentum space generates a geometrical phase which alters the interference associated with reciprocal <b>scattering</b> <b>paths.</b> In the massless case, a well-known dip in the momentum distribution develops at backscattering (respective to the Dirac point considered) around the transport mean free time. This dip later vanishes in the honeycomb case because of trigonal warping. In the massive case, the dynamical phase of the <b>scattering</b> <b>paths</b> becomes crucial. Its interplay with the geometrical phase induces an additional transient broken reflection symmetry in the momentum distribution. The direction of this asymmetry is a property of the Dirac point considered, independent of the energy of the wave packet. These Berry phase effects could be observed in current cold atom lattice experiments. Comment: Additional data and explanations compared to version 1.

Atmospheric conditions also affect the multiple scattering contributions. A tenuous atmosphere generally leads to higher path loss at a small range than a thick or extra thick atmosphere where rich multiple scattering enhances received signal strength. As a by-product, when contributions from only single scattering are retained, the corresponding single <b>scattering</b> <b>path</b> loss shows a good match with that predicted by Reilly's analytical single scattering model [1]. A disadvantage of the proposed model is that it cannot provide pulse spreading information, while the Monte Carlo model can [2].|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} was to find some {{approach}} to the calculation of electrical transport properties for concentrated binary alloys from first principles in order to study the influence of short-range order on the electrical resistivity. The theoretical treatment relies on an one-electron picture, {{within the framework of}} density functional theory, using the multiple scattering theory to solve the electronic structure problem. For transport calculations the Kubo-Greenwood formula of linear response theory was used. The multiple scattering theory shows that the <b>scattering</b> <b>path</b> operators, that result from the decomposition of the Green function, are the most important quantities involved in the calculation of observables. It was shown how <b>scattering</b> <b>path</b> operators could be calculated by means of cluster methods in order to allow the take into account of information about the local arrangement of atoms in a cluster. The embedded cluster method (ECM), was already used in many calculations of electronic properties and was shown to give reliable results. Its applications to resistivity calculations was, however, only sporadic. The isolated cluster method (ICM) was for the first time applied to calculations of properties. The results showed that both ECM and ICM are well suited for modelling short-range order in alloys with high resistivity giving the right tendency of the change in the resistivity due to ordering processes. It was argued that the widespread procedure of including only up to d-states (l= 2) in calculations of electronic properties is not appropriate when one aims to calculate electrical resistivities. For comparison of such calculations with experiment the inclusion of at least f-states (l= 3) is absolutely necessary.
