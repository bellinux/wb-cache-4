50|$|The <b>straight-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> (Dendroplex picus) is {{a species}} of bird in the woodcreeper {{subfamily}} (Dendrocolaptinae). Its genus, Dendroplex, was recently confirmed to be distinct from Xiphorhynchus. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical mangrove forests, and heavily degraded former forest.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipality}} of Dabajuro {{lies in the}} Catatumbo Moist Forests ecoregion, and the major natural habitat type is tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests. The area of the municipality has seen a historical transformation from remote woodlands (predominant in 81.5% of the area) to populated rangelands (predominant in 63.0% of the area) between 1700 and 2000. Common birds include Black-crested Antshrike (Sakesphorus canadensis), Rufous-browed Peppershrike (Cyclarhis gujanensis), <b>Straight-billed</b> <b>Woodcreeper</b> (Xiphorhynchus picus), White-whiskered Spinetail (Synallaxis candei), Trinidad Euphonia (Euphonia trinitatis), Scrub Greenlet (Hylophilus flavipes).|$|E

50|$|The <b>straight-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper's</b> {{range is}} {{in central and}} north South America, east of the Andes cordillera, and {{encompasses}} the entire Amazon Basin and the Caatinga. The species is found in Panama of Central America, and only the four countries, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, of southernmost South America are excluded from the South American range.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, the species-level {{taxonomy}} of several groups requires further study. Examples of [...] "species" [...] where vocal and morphological variations suggests {{that more than}} one species-level taxon could be involved are the curve-billed scythebill and the white-chinned, olivaceous, strong-billed and <b>straight-billed</b> <b>woodcreepers.</b> The genus Xiphorhynchus also requires much more research in this regard. Hylexetastes may contain anything from one to four species.|$|R
