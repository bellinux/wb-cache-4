2500|$|The precessing nuclei {{can also}} {{fall out of}} {{alignment}} with each other (returning the net magnetization vector to a non-precessing field) and stop producing a signal. This is called T2 or transverse relaxation. Because {{of the difference in}} the actual relaxation mechanisms involved (for example, intermolecular versus intramolecular magnetic dipole-dipole interactions [...] ), T1 is usually (except in rare cases) longer than T2 (that is, slower <b>spin-lattice</b> <b>relaxation,</b> for example because of smaller dipole-dipole interaction effects). In practice, the value of T2* which is the actually observed decay time of the observed NMR signal, or free induction decay (to [...] of the initial amplitude immediately after the resonant RF pulse), also depends on the static magnetic field inhomogeneity, which is quite significant. (There is also a smaller but significant contribution to the observed FID shortening from the RF inhomogeneity of the resonant pulse). In the corresponding FT-NMR spectrum—meaning the Fourier transform of the free induction decay—the T2* time is inversely related to the width of the NMR signal in frequency units. Thus, a nucleus with a long T2 relaxation time gives rise to a very sharp NMR peak in the FT-NMR spectrum for a very homogeneous ("well-shimmed") static magnetic field, whereas nuclei with shorter T2 values give rise to broad FT-NMR peaks even when the magnet is shimmed well. Both T1 and T2 depend on the rate of molecular motions as well as the gyromagnetic ratios of both the resonating and their strongly interacting, next-neighbor nuclei that are not at resonance.|$|E

40|$|Carbon nanofibers were {{fluorinated}} in two manners, in pure fluorine gas (direct fluorination) {{and with}} a fluorinating agent (TbF 4 during the so-called controlled fluorination). The resulting fluorinated nanofibers have been investigated by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). This underlines that the fluorination mechanisms differ since a (CF) n structural type is obtained, whatever the temperature, with the controlled reaction, whereas, during the direct process, a (C 2 F) n type is formed over a wide temperature range.

50|$|So far the {{magnetization}} was tipped {{into the}} xy-plane and it remained {{there with the}} same magnitude. However, in reality the electron spins interact with their surroundings and the magnetization in the xy-plane will decay and eventually return to alignment with the z-axis. This relaxation process is described by the <b>spin-lattice</b> <b>relaxation</b> time T1, which is a characteristic time needed by the magnetization {{to return to the}} z-axis, and by the spin-spin relaxation time T2, which describes the vanishing time of the magnetization in the xy-plane. The <b>spin-lattice</b> <b>relaxation</b> results from the urge of the system to return to thermal equilibrium after it has been perturbed by the B1 pulse. Return of the magnetization parallel to B0 is achieved through interactions with the surroundings, that is <b>spin-lattice</b> <b>relaxation.</b> The corresponding relaxation time needs to be considered when extracting a signal from noise, where the experiment needs to be repeated several times, as quickly as possible. In order to repeat the experiment, one needs to wait until the magnetization along the z-axis has recovered, because if there is no magnetization in z direction, then there is nothing to tip into the xy-plane to create a significant signal.|$|E
