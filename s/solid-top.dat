5000|$|The Model 336 is {{a direct}} {{development}} of the Marlin Model 1893 rifle which was produced from 1893 to 1936. [...] Based on the patents of L.L. Hepburn, the Model 1893 incorporated a new locking bolt system and a two-piece firing pin. [...] In 1936, with only {{minor changes to the}} stock, forearm, and sights, the Model 1893 was redesignated the Model 1936 (soon renamed the Model 36). [...] All of these firearms featured a <b>solid-top</b> receiver made of forged steel and incorporated side ejection of fired cartridges. [...] Compared to the Winchester 94, then the predominant lever-action hunting rifle, the Model 36 was somewhat heavier with a simpler internal mechanism and a full pistol grip-type buttstock in contrast to the Winchester 94's straight grip stock.|$|E
5000|$|The Model Golden 39A {{is built}} of forged steel parts and American grown black walnut. It {{is one of}} the very few {{remaining}} [...]22 rifles with easy takedown ability (it can be taken apart using a coin). The screw that allows the easy takedown, however, is frequently criticized as it disrupts the otherwise clean lines of the rifle. Further, in the event of a malfunction which prevents the breech from closing, takedown becomes impossible until the action can be cleared as the breech must be closed before takedown. The Model Golden 39A has a <b>solid-top</b> receiver and side ejection, which makes mounting a scope easy. One source claims that the signature gold trigger was discontinued in favor of a blued trigger between 1982 and 1985, but at least one [...] "Original Golden 39A" [...] from 1982 (SN 18260086) was made with the gold trigger, perhaps as a special order.|$|E
