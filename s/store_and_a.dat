In {{a letter to the}} editor of The Tennessean, former Sounds owner Larry Schmittou expressed his interest in Greer becoming an amateur baseball park, citing its amenities and several Metro high schools that lack baseball diamonds of their own. Two public meetings were held in September 2016 to discuss these and other proposals and ideas for the space.|$|E

After moving back to Pennsylvania, Pollard was a color commentator on broadcasts of Eagles games for WIP radio and worked with Charlie Swift, the play-by-play man, from 1969 to 1976. The former anchored a postgame Eagles program for WCAU-TV and occasionally commented for CBS television. His voice and knowledge of sports was praised by Eagles publicist Jim Gallagher.|$|E

5|$|According to Home Office statistics, an {{estimated}} 400businesses within {{half a mile}} (0.8km) of the blast were affected, 40% of which did not recover. The heaviest damage was sustained by the three buildings nearest the bomb: Michael House, comprising a Marks & Spencer <b>store</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> six-storey office block; Longridge House, offices for Royal and Sun Alliance, an insurance company; and the Arndale Centre, a shopping mall. Michael House was deemed beyond economic repair and demolished. Marks & Spencer {{took the opportunity to}} acquire and demolish the adjacent Longridge House, using the enlarged site for the world's biggest branch of the store. The company's fortunes changed during construction, and Selfridges subsequently co-occupied the building; Marks & Spencer leased part of the Lewis's store in the interim. The frontage of the Arndale was badly damaged and was removed in a remodelling of that part of the city centre.|$|E
5|$|After {{talks of}} closure for years, Wayzata Bay Center closed its doors on August 15, 2011. Demolition began shortly after in April 2012, when all {{stores in the}} mall had either {{relocated}} or closed. The Original Pancake House, a restaurant, was the final tenant to close in the mall. The restaurant, a tenant of the center since 1994, relocated to neighboring Plymouth, while Adele's Frozen Custard, a tenant in the mall since 2009, closed their Wayzata location entirely. Among the mall's other final tenants were a True Value hardware store, a jewelry store, a health food <b>store,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> furniture store.|$|E
5|$|As {{a market}} town, Wellingborough has major high street chains mainly {{located in the}} town centre. The only {{shopping}} centre, Swansgate, previously known as the Arndale Centre, {{was built in the}} 1970s. Since 2009 the Borough Council has been looking at rebuilding the centre and major stores want bigger floor-spaces. The Britannica Fund, which owns Swansgate shopping centre is currently in administration, and decision {{on the future of the}} centre is expected in early 2013. Supplementing the town centre shops are several out-of-town retail parks and supermarkets including a Sainsbury's, four Tesco stores, an Aldi <b>store</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Morrisons store in the town centre. The town has a market three times a week and a weekly privately organised market.|$|E

5|$|In Miami, {{sustained}} winds reached , shattering plate-glass {{windows and}} interrupting electrical and telegraph services. The Florida East Coast Railway Station in Hallandale Beach was nearly destroyed. Windows and roofs were damaged in Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale, but damage was minor overall. At the latter, the storm also downed power lines, telephone wires, and trees, and destroyed car garages. The hurricane caused two fatalities in the city. In Pompano Beach, the recently constructed Pompano Theater was severely damaged. The Kester Building, a drug <b>store,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> grocery store also suffered impact. Nearly all small frame houses were destroyed in Deerfield Beach, while several citizens estimated {{that at least}} 50% of homes were demolished. The town's post office, depot, and an entire business block were also destroyed. A freight train was blown off its tracks. An eight year old boy drowned in a ditch near where his family sought refugee, while 51 additional people were injured throughout Broward County.|$|E
5|$|The cellar of the {{building}} contained a barber's shop, a grocery <b>store</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> butcher shop. The remaining premises were used as apartments for rent. When Dimitri Orlov died in 1911 while building a railroad in the Russian Far East, his widow, left with five children, had to sell off the house to pay her family's debts. In 1983, renovation works were started on {{the building}} to convert it into a hotel. Since {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union in 1991, various reconstruction works have been largely unsuccessful. As of 2009, the Castle of Richard the Lionheart still stands empty and fenced off in renovation.|$|E
5|$|Business {{and family}} {{commitments}} kept Rush busy {{for the next}} few years. He moved his home up-river from Maclean to Grafton, the effective 'capital' of the Clarence River district. Rush purchased a hotel and an adjacent <b>store,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> riverside villa which he named 'Clarence House'. Rush took an active part in a great many community and sporting organisations. He was a founder of the Grafton Rowing Club and was several times an office-holder of the Clarence River Jockey Club. He continued to promote and take part in local regattas. One of these was the Clarence River Aquatic Carnival, held on 10 March 1883. The Carnival attracted thousands of spectators. The main event was Rush vs Laycock for a stake of £1000 and the Championship of Australia, which Laycock won convincingly. At a banquet later that week, Rush announced his retirement from professional sculling, but in December of that year, he rowed Trickett on the Parramatta River for a stake of £400, and lost convincingly. The newspapers praised Rush for his valour, but hinted that it was high time he retired.|$|E

5|$|He {{relocated}} {{to the town}} of Edmonton in 1892, becoming the town's first architect. He also operated a brickyard upon settling. In 1892, Edmiston, working independently at the time, was contracted by the Edmonton Town Council to draft a map of the town. In that same year, he was also a member of a committee tasked with a project to establish a brewery in Edmonton. In 1893, he established a partnership with local architect Nathaniel G. Flater, and operated under the name Edmiston & Flater, headquartered at the Edmonton Imperial Bank Building. The firm designed many notable buildings for the town, including the first post office, the city's first brick school (for the Edmonton Public School District), the All Saints' Anglican Cathedral, a home for Herbert Charles Wilson, the McDougall & Secord retail <b>store,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> fire hall. In 1899, he would end his partnership with Flater and enter into a new one, with Henry D. Johnson of Calgary, under the firm name Edmiston & Johnson Architects, Draughtsmen, Valuators and Insurance Agents. This firm was responsible for constructing, amongst many, a hospital building, a new Presbyterian church and making alterations to the Robertson Hall Theatre.|$|E
5|$|The Half Day area {{experienced}} an economic boom {{with the arrival}} of new settlers during the two decades after Wright's arrival. Among these pioneers were Seth Washburn, the first postmaster of the Vernon Township, who settled at the site of what later became the Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103's Half Day Intermediate School, and Laura Sprague, the first teacher to reside in the area. By 1855, 21years after the settling of the Half Day area by Wright, the town was a thriving community with a blacksmith's shop, sawmill, country <b>store,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> church. At this time, the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad connected Milwaukee to the county seat of Waukegan, and it expanded throughout the Lake County area over the next few decades; this also contributed to the town's prosperity. Henry Ford's invention of the automobile in the early 20thcentury made Half Day a more accessible destination to other communities within the Chicago metropolitan area, and the village became a popular recreation area. This prompted the opening of many businesses, including an amusement park, a race track, a bowling alley, a dance hall, and taverns, that catered to visitors.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS (NDS) {{features}} a touch screen and built-in microphone, and supports wireless IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards. Additionally, the {{revised version of}} the NDS, the Nintendo DSi, features two built in cameras, the ability to download games from the DSi <b>store,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> web browser. The PlayStation Portable (PSP) released later the same year on December 12, 2004, followed a different pattern. It became the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format, Universal Media Disc (UMD), as its primary storage media. Sony also gave the PSP robust multi-media capability, connectivity with the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2 (only on some games), other PSPs, as well as Internet connectivity. The Nintendo DS likewise had connectivity to the internet through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and Nintendo DS Browser, as well as wireless connectivity to other DS systems and Wii consoles. Despite high sales numbers for both consoles, PlayStation Portable sales have consistently lagged behind those of the Nintendo DS; nevertheless, the PlayStation Portable has {{the distinction of being}} the best-selling non-Nintendo handheld gaming system.|$|E
