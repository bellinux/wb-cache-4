The same problem exists for the slide <b>lock</b> <b>button.</b> These problems were mainly found in the early models exported to the United States of America. The company then focused its attention on these issues and were solved by reducing the resistance of the safety lever and over-ride slide <b>lock</b> <b>button.</b> The user can now operate both levers effectively and easily without taking the left hand off the pump.
