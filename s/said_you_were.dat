5|$|The Buccaneers, {{making their}} NFL debut against the Houston Oilers, {{averaged}} {{less than two}} yards per offensive play. They were unable to score despite being given good field position by two Oiler fumbles. Steve Spurrier completed 8 of 21 passes for 36 yards, and starting running backs Jimmy DuBose and Louis Carter rushed for 12 yards on 15 carries. Despite being outgained 169 to 8 by the second quarter, they were only behind 7–0 and missed a chance to tie the score when Lee McGriff dropped a Spurrier pass in the end zone. A later drive ended when Spurrier overthrew John McKay, Jr., instead hitting defender C.L. Whittington. A third chance to tie the score was lost when Mark Cotney dropped an interception of a Dan Pastorini pass with a clear path to the end zone. Whittington gave the Buccaneers {{the ball on the}} Oiler 11-yard line by fumbling a punt, but then killed the Buccaneers’ scoring chances by intercepting another Spurrier pass. Ronnie Coleman ran 25 times for 142 yards for the Oilers. McKay expressed concern over the team’s offense after the defeat, and responded to a reporter’s taunt of “I thought you <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going to win some games?” by saying, “Houston has been in the league 6,000 years and still hasn’t won a championship. The Bucs will be heard from”. It was a day with a bad beginning, middle, and ending for the Buccaneers. The day began with the Buccaneers getting lost in the maze-like Astrodome interior, and ended with the team’s charter plane bouncing and rolling before righting itself on landing. In addition, starting tackle Dave Reavis was injured during pregame warmups and was lost for the season.|$|E
500|$|While Millett was {{speaking}} about sexual liberation at Columbia University, {{a woman in}} the audience asked her, [...] "Why don't you say you're a lesbian, here, openly. You've <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a lesbian in the past." [...] Millett hesitantly responded, [...] "Yes, I am a lesbian". A couple of weeks later, Time December 8, 1970 article [...] "Women's Lib: A Second Look" [...] reported that Millett admitted she was bisexual, which it said would likely discredit her as a spokesperson for the feminist movement because it [...] "reinforce the views of those skeptics who routinely dismiss all liberationists as lesbians." [...] In response, two days later a press conference was organized by feminists Ivy Bottini and Barbara Love in Greenwich Village in which they spoke of their [...] "solidarity with the struggle of homosexuals to attain their liberation in a sexist society" [...] to Kate Millett and other attendees.|$|E
500|$|Both Kanye West and Carlos Mencia responded {{within one}} day of the episode's {{original}} broadcast and said they enjoyed the parodies of themselves, although Kanye West said on his blog that his feelings were hurt. [...] After the episode was broadcast, Mencia wrote on his Twitter feed, [...] "They just made fun of me on South Park. I thought it was hysterical. Catch the rerun." [...] Dave Itzkoff, arts reporter for The New York Times, complimented Mencia for his response. West wrote on his blog, [...] "South Park murdered me last night and it's pretty damn funny. It hurts my feelings but what can you expect from South Park!" [...] West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged {{he has a problem}} with his ego, but said he was trying to change. Parker and Stone said they were extremely surprised by West's reaction, and felt Mencia was treated far more harshly in the episode than West. Parker said, [...] "It was like, dude, we just <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a gay fish. What are you talking about? It was so dumb." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{fight was}} a {{punishing}} display {{on both sides}} under oppressively hot conditions. During the fight, Ali said to Frazier, [...] "They <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> through, Joe." [...] Frazier said, [...] "They lied." [...] After 14 grueling rounds, Futch stopped the fight with Frazier having a closed left eye, an almost-closed right eye and a cut. Ali later {{said that it was}} the [...] "closest thing to dying that I know of." [...] In 1977, Ali told interviewer Reg Gutteridge that he felt this third Frazier fight was his best performance. When Gutteridge suggested his win over Cleveland Williams, Ali said, [...] "No, Frazier's much tougher and rougher than Cleveland Williams".|$|E
