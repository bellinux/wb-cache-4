5|$|Only four known {{systems were}} {{observed}} during the 1953 season. This was below the average at that time, which was six. Furthermore, {{the season was}} well below the 1949-2006average of 13named storms and had the fewest number of storms in the hurricane database. Only two tropical cyclones reached hurricane status, compared to the modern-day average of seven. Furthermore, 1953 {{is also one of}} the few seasons without a major hurricane. This season was part of a decade-long absence of major hurricanes; from 1950–56, no major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind <b>Scale)</b> <b>were</b> reported in the Eastern Pacific basin. However, it is possible that some storms were missed due to the lack of satellite coverage in the region in addition to the lack of Hurricane Hunter data, which did not become available until the following year.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1930s, {{more than}} a dozen {{different}} climbing routes had been established on Grand Teton including the northeast ridge in 1931 by Glenn Exum. Glenn Exum teamed up with another noted climber named Paul Petzoldt to found the Exum Mountain Guides in 1931. Of the other major peaks on the Teton Range, all were climbed by the late 1930s including Mount Moran in 1922 and Mount Owen in 1930 by Fritiof Fryxell and others after numerous previous attempts had failed. Both Middle and South Teton were first climbed on the same day, August 29, 1923, by a group of climbers led by Albert R. Ellingwood. New routes on the peaks were explored as safety equipment and skills improved and eventually climbs rated at above 5.9 on the Yosemite Decimal System difficulty <b>scale</b> <b>were</b> established on Grand Teton. The classic climb following the route first pioneered by Owen, known as the Owen-Spalding route, is rated at 5.4 due a combination of concerns beyond the gradient alone. Rock climbing and bouldering had become popular in the park by the mid 20th century. In the late 1950s, gymnast John Gill came to the park and started climbing large boulders near Jenny Lake. Gill approached climbing from a gymnastics perspective and while in the Tetons became the first known climber in history to use gymnastic chalk to improve handholds and to keep hands dry while climbing. During the latter decades of the 20th century, extremely difficult cliffs were explored including some in Death Canyon, and by the mid-1990s, 800 different climbing routes had been documented for the various peaks and canyon cliffs.|$|E
5|$|The {{aristocracy}} {{shared their}} power {{only with the}} Roman Catholic Church. The Church ruled by fear of damnation in the next life and of the Inquisition in the present, and consequently both upper and lower classes gave as generously as they could on all major saints' days. Many priests and bishops {{were members of the}} aristocracy. The wealth of the Church in Sicily was further enhanced by the tradition of pressing younger children of the aristocracy to enter monasteries and convents, in order to preserve the family estates from division; a large fee, or dowry, was usually paid to the Church to facilitate this, in the form of property, jewels, or money. Thus the wealth of certain religious orders grew out of all proportion to the economic growth of any other group at this time. This {{is one of the reasons}} that so many of the Sicilian Baroque churches and monasteries, such as San Martino delle <b>Scale,</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt after 1693 on such a lavish scale.|$|E
50|$|The {{scales of}} the rainbow fish were red, blue, green, and yellow. The green <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> made of grass, {{representing}} the element Earth. The blue <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> ice, which represented water: the second element. The yellow <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> lightning, representing air. The red <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> made of fire, representing the fourth element. The four elements that made up The Rainbow Fish's <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> also known as Prithvi, Jal, Vayu, and Agni.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{developing}} a <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> proposed to measure career decision making self-efficacy for primary school 8 th year students. <b>Scale</b> <b>was</b> developed according to social cognitive career and self-efficacy theory. <b>Scale</b> <b>is</b> composed of 27 items. It is a Likert type scale and has three sub <b>scales.</b> The <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> applied on 480 primary school 8 th year students for {{validity and reliability}} analysis. Construct validity of the <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> determined by factor analysis. Item-total correlation, Alfa correlation and the <b>scale</b> score stability <b>were</b> computed for reliability analysis. Findings about {{reliability and validity of}} the scale indicated that careerdecision making self efficacy <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> a valid and reliable instrument...|$|R
50|$|A letter <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> a {{weighing}} <b>scale</b> {{used for}} weighing letters {{in order to}} determine the correct amount of postage. Until the 1990s most letter <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> mechanical, but today electronic <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> the most common.|$|R

25|$|The British Isles {{continue}} {{to be subject to}} several very minor earthquakes each month, and occasional light to moderate ones. During the 20th century 25 earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 to 6.1 on the Richter <b>scale</b> <b>were</b> felt, many of them originating within England itself. Notable was the Colchester earthquake in 1884 and the 2002 Dudley earthquake.|$|E

50|$|<b>Scales</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} listed {{from low}} to high pitch. Most <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> octave-repeating, meaning their pattern of notes {{is the same}} in every octave (the Bohlen-Pierce <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> one exception). An octave-repeating <b>scale</b> can <b>be</b> represented as a circular arrangement of pitch classes, ordered by increasing (or decreasing) pitch class. For instance, the increasing C major <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C, with the bracket indicating that the last note is an octave higher than the first note, and the decreasing C major <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> C-B-A-G-F-E-D-C, with the bracket indicating an octave lower than the first note in the scale.|$|R
50|$|A {{programmable}} <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> a {{new generation}} of scale indicator. Programmable <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> offered by all the major scale manufacturers. The easiest way to describe a programmable <b>scale</b> would <b>be</b> to call it a PLC 'light'. Programmable <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> used in many s such as batching, labeling, filling, truck scales and more.|$|R
25|$|People {{with high}} scores on a psychopathy rating scale {{are more likely to}} engage in bullying, crime and drug use than other people. Hare and Babiak noted that about 29 per cent of {{corporate}} psychopaths are also bullies. Other research has also shown that people with {{high scores on}} a psychopathy rating <b>scale</b> <b>were</b> {{more likely to engage in}} bullying, again indicating that psychopaths tend to be bullies in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of the Philippine Revolution, the Filipino society was {{subdivided}} into social classifications that were based on the economic status of a person. There were two main classes in this system. The highest people on the social <b>scale</b> <b>were</b> members of the principalia, and the other class was the masses. The principalia included landlords, teachers, local officials and ex-officials. The members of this class constituted the social aristocracy of a town.|$|E
25|$|The New Zealand {{team was}} in a state of transition, with older players such as John Reid and Bert Sutcliffe, who had both first come to England with the 1949 New Zealand side, nearing retirement. At the other end of the <b>scale</b> <b>were</b> several {{promising}} batsmen, including Bev Congdon and Barry Sinclair, and young seam bowlers in Richard Collinge and Bruce Taylor. These last two, and Vic Pollard, the Lancashire-born off-spinner, were only 19 at the time of the tour.|$|E
2500|$|An {{advantage}} of N <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> {{that it allows}} hobbyists to build layouts that take up less space than HO scale, or put longer track runs into {{the same amount of}} space, because the models are smaller (by nearly a half) than they <b>are</b> in HO <b>scale</b> (1:87). While N <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> quite small, it is not the smallest commercially available scale, as [...] Z <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> smaller yet at 1:220 and T <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> 1:450 or 1:480.

25|$|The {{fact that}} the Essen statue is {{free-standing}} and its enamel eyes point {{to the influence of}} Byzantine art and its spreading to the Holy Roman Empire after the marriage of Emperor Otto II with the Byzantine princess Theophanu in 972, although statues on this large <b>scale</b> <b>were</b> completely outside Byzantine traditions after the Byzantine iconoclasm. The overall form of the Madonna indicates that the sculptor was not experienced in carving free-standing sculptures, since profile, front and rear view do not match up to a harmonic whole.|$|E
25|$|Three-quarters {{of white}} Zimbabweans are of British or British diasporan origin; {{at various times}} many emigrated from South Africa and elsewhere. After World War II, Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia) {{received}} a substantial influx of emigrants from the United Kingdom—a handful previously resided in other colonies such as Pakistan and Kenya. Also represented on a much smaller <b>scale</b> <b>were</b> individuals of Afrikaner, Greek, and Portuguese origin. After Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, Ian Smith's administration removed technical obstacles to immigration from southern Europe.|$|E

25|$|At {{the bottom}} of the <b>scale</b> <b>were</b> the {{ubiquitous}} discentes ("those learning") or medical apprentices. Roman doctors of any stature combed the population for persons in any social setting who had an interest in and ability for practicing medicine. On the one hand the doctor used their services unremittingly. On the other they were treated like members of the family; i.e., they came to stay with the doctor and when they left they were themselves doctors. The best doctors were the former apprentices of the Aesculapia, who, in effect, served residencies there.|$|E
25|$|Torpedoes and mines {{were located}} at Swan Island and {{were to be}} laid across the {{shipping}} channels in times of war. Swan Island was permanently manned by Engineers of the Victorian Military Forces. Plans for a fixed gun battery adjacent to the signal station at Point Lonsdale did not proceed, but defences {{on the western side}} of the Bay were supplemented by mobile artillery being stationed there during both world wars. Fort Nepean, Fort Cheviot and Fort Pearce on {{the eastern side of the}} Bay were also developed and, although on a lesser <b>scale,</b> <b>were</b> similar to those at Fort Queenscliff.|$|E
25|$|The German Meteorological Service {{had advised}} {{people to stay}} indoors and avoid {{unnecessary}} trips on 18 January, and wind strengths of up to 12 on the Beaufort <b>scale</b> <b>were</b> seen across the Netherlands and Germany as the storm made landfall. The storm moved across the German states of Lower Saxony, Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia first, then spread across the whole country in the evening hours of 18 January. Wind gusts as high as 202km/h (125mph) on the Wendelstein and 198km/h (123mph) on the Brocken in the Harz mountains were recorded. The storm then moved eastwards, its center crossing Lower Saxony between 18:00 and 19:00 CET, moving toward the Baltic sea, its cold front spawning several tornadoes in Germany, three {{of which have been}} confirmed as of 22 February. In the Czech Republic the highest wind speed was measured on Sněžka in the Krkonoše mountains, where wind gusts reached 212km/h (132mph). In the Czech Republic winds as high as 200km/h disrupted both rail and air traffic; record high temperatures reached 14°C (57°F) in Prague.|$|E
50|$|The Twaddell <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> a {{hydrometer}} <b>scale</b> {{for reporting}} the measured specific gravity of a liquid relative to water.
