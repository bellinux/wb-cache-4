40|$|Dynamic load {{balancing}} {{is a popular}} recent technique that protects ISP networks from sudden congestion caused by load spikes or link failures. Dynamic {{load balancing}} protocols, however, require schemes for <b>splitting</b> <b>traffic</b> across multiple paths at a fine granularity. Current splitting schemes present a tussle between slicing granularity and packet reordering. <b>Splitting</b> <b>traffic</b> at the granularity of packets quickly and accurately assigns the desired traffic share to each path, but can reorder packets within a TCP flow, confusing TCP congestion control. <b>Splitting</b> <b>traffic</b> at the granularity of a flow avoids packet reordering but may overshoot the desired shares by up to 60 % in dynamic environments, resulting in low end-to-end network goodput. Contrary to popular belief, we show that one can systematically split a single flow across multiple paths without causing packet reordering. We propose FLARE, a new <b>traffic</b> <b>splitting</b> algorithm that operates on bursts of packets, carefully chosen to avoid reordering. Using a combination of analysis and trace-driven simulations, we show that FLARE attains accuracy and responsiveness comparable to packet switching without reordering packets.

40|$|This paper settles {{a long-standing}} {{question}} {{with a positive}} answer: optimal traffic engineering can be realized using just link-state routing protocols. In conventional link-state protocols like OSPF and IS-IS, routers compute shortest paths based on link weights, <b>splitting</b> <b>traffic</b> evenly when multiple shortest paths exist. Unfortunately, in these particular cases of link-state protocols, computing the optimal link weights for a given traffic matrix is an NP-hard problem. Even the best setting of the weights can lead to traffic loads that deviate significantly from the ideal distribution of the traffic. In this work, we show that <b>splitting</b> <b>traffic</b> over multiple paths as an exponential function of path length can achieve optimal traffic engineering. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the optimal link weights, which in practice is also much more efficient than the local-search heuristics used today. In addition, we show how to apply the algorithm to robust traffic engineering, where one set of link weights must perform well for multiple traffic matrices or failure scenarios. These results are based on our new Network Entropy Maximization framework for routingprotocol design, which parallels the role of Network Utility Maximization for congestion control. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Network {{operators}} {{control the}} flow of traffic through their networks by adapting {{the configuration of the}} underlying routing protocols. For example, they tune the integer link weights that interior gateway protocols like OSPF and IS-IS use to compute shortest paths. The resulting optimization problem—to find the best link weights for a given topology and traffic matrix—is computationally intractable even for the simplest objective functions, forcing the use of local-search techniques. The optimization problem is difficult in part because these protocols <b>split</b> <b>traffic</b> evenly along shortest paths, with no ability to adjust the splitting percentages or direct traffic on other paths. In this paper, we propose an extension to these protocols, called Distributed Exponentially-weighted Flow SpliTting (DEFT), where the routers can direct traffic on nonshortest paths, with an exponential penalty on longer paths. DEFT leads not only to an easier-to-solve optimization problem, but also to weight settings that provably perform no worse than OSPF and IS-IS. Furthermore, in our optimization problem, both link weights and flows of traffic are integrated as optimization variables into the formulation and jointly solved by a twostage iterative method. Our novel formulation leads to a much more efficient way to identify good link weights than the local-search heuristics used for OSPF and IS-IS today. DEFT retains the simplicity of having routers compute paths based on configurable link weights, while approaching the performance of more complex routing protocols that can <b>split</b> <b>traffic</b> arbitrarily over any paths...|$|E

For example, they tune the integer link weights that routing protocols like OSPF use to do distributed forwarding of packets. The resulting optimization problem by the operator—to find the best link weights for a given topology and traffic matrix—is well-known to be computationally intractable even for the simplest objective functions, forcing the use of local-search techniques. This is a difficult optimization in part because these protocols <b>split</b> <b>traffic</b> evenly along shortest paths and {{in part because of the}} specific representation of the optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a readily implementable routing protocol called Distributed Exponentially-weighted Flow SpliTting (DEFT), where the routers can direct traffic on non-shortest paths, with an exponential penalty on longer paths. It leads to a cost function for the operator that is provably not worse than OSPF, and verified to be almost optimal in experiments based on various network topologies. One of the innovations in solving link weight optimization for DEFT is on problem representation: both link weights and traffic flows are integrated as optimization variables, and another is the computational method of two-stage iterative relaxation, which is much more efficient than state-of-the-art local search heuristics. DEFT retains the simplicity of having routers compute paths based on configurable link weights, while approaching the performance of more complex routing protocols that can <b>split</b> <b>traffic</b> arbitrarily over any paths...|$|E
40|$|The {{contemporary}} high-speed networks, e. g. the Internet and asynchronous {{transfer mode}} (ATM) networks provide a convenient and cost-effective communication platform to carry the emerging multimedia applications. However, problems, such as network congestion caused by overloaded traffic get worse day by day. Thus, how to properly control the system while maintaining the quality of service (QoS) for users becomes an important and challenging issue. To reach the goal of QoS guarantee, load sharing or traffic balancing is one of important techniques to improve the whole network performance. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} probabilistic routing policy and analyze <b>split</b> <b>traffic</b> models under such a probabilistic routing policy with input traffic models of the batch Markovian arrival process (BMAP) and discrete-time BMAP (D-BMAP) which can be employed to characterize the multimedia traffic in current and future networks.
