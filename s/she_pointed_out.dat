5|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{that when}} the {{discussion}} was reported to Washington, the leading US generals in the U.S. military lobbied Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible to work within the parameters laid out by Saigon and that the U.S. should simply take control of anti-communist military policy, thereby necessitating a coup. The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|Nanako Kato, a {{spokesperson}} from Sony Computer Entertainment, addressed the matter from Tokyo. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that historical buildings {{are often used}} in entertainment, such as in iconic movie scenes involving Godzilla and the Tokyo Tower and King Kong in Manhattan. She acknowledged {{the church in the}} game holds a resemblance to Manchester Cathedral, but that the point was to depict a backdrop of an old church, not to illustrate a specific church. She added that Sony understands why the Church of England was offended especially because of its efforts to reduce the serious problem of gun violence in Manchester. She did not answer on whether Sony would donate money to the Cathedral's anti-gun program as the Church has demanded. At the time, over 2million copies of the game had been sold.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{that her}} {{employment}} opportunities were being blocked, that same year, on 19 January 1959, Johnson asked {{to address the}} members of the Bahamian House of the Assembly, but was told she could only speak after the session adjourned, to which she agreed. In her speech, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that a petition had been submitted to the House in 1958 for suffrage, which Members had claimed showed only 13 petitioners and 529 signatories. She provided mimeographed copies showing the actual number was 2,829 people and included people from Abaco, Andros, Cat Island, Eleuthera, Exuma, Grand Bahama, Long Island, and New Providence. She went on to complain that women were being taxed without representation and reasoned that should the vote not be extended to them, they should no longer have to pay taxes. She insisted that women were working members of society and were ready, willing, and able to participate as full citizens. Though the Members of Parliament were impressed with the speech, they did nothing.|$|E

5|$|By 1939, the Bells {{had moved}} to Brisbane, where John was Queensland manager for Airlines of Australia Ltd, having left the RAAF in 1929. Mary became leader of forty or so members of the Women's National Emergency Legion Air Wing who had volunteered to assist with {{aircraft}} maintenance during times of war. Determining that their objectives would not be met in their existing organisation, on 17July they formed a new paramilitary group, the Women's Air Training Corps (WATC), and elected Bell its commander. She soon expanded the WATC into a national organisation, with Commandants leading each state's chapter, and herself as Australian Commandant. Bell wrote to Air Vice Marshal Richard Williams, with whom she was acquainted via her husband and through aviation circles, advocating {{the establishment of a}} women's branch of the RAAF similar to the RAF's Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). Among other things, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that female volunteers such as hers were already supporting the Air Force in driving, nursing and clerical duties. The WATC was one of several women's voluntary organisations whose members were keen to support the military, arguing that their personnel provided a ready-made pool of skilled staff for auxiliary services, saving the government time and money training unskilled labour.|$|E
5|$|Charles Onyett of IGN {{found the}} {{gameplay}} enjoyable and {{enough to be}} appreciated by any genre fan. Yet he stated that if players were not Dragon Ball fans, then they will not {{want to play the}} game. Robert Thompson of Nintendojo felt that the game would satisfy fans of both the series and the genre, but he would complain about the ki and Sparking Combo attacks being repetitive, and the story shifting control of the characters, stating it could make unfamiliar gamers disoriented. Ryan Olsen of Kombo.com praised the battle system, calling it more engaging than the ones found in the average RPG. Still he would call the game a cut and dry RPG, calling the Active Guard system the only exotic aspect of the game. Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report called the game vanilla with an interesting twists, stating that the fans should be the ones playing the game. He also drew comparisons of the Active Guard system to the Timed Hit system from Super Mario RPG, and Rage Gage to the Limit Break from Final Fantasy. Brittany Vincent of RPGFan would call side quests like Krillin's return home an added treat to the long story. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> the game's difficulty being frustrating, stating that the game will cause players to revert to the start screen many times, yet is still beatable.|$|E
25|$|Germain {{published}} her prize-winning essay at her {{own expense}} in 1821, mostly {{because she wanted to}} present her work in opposition to that of Poisson. In the essay <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> some of the errors in her method.|$|E

25|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that {{polygamy}} {{was illegal}} in Malaysia for non-Muslims {{but not for}} Muslims, and that child custody arrangements for Muslims were biased towards fathers {{as opposed to the}} shared-custody arrangements of non-Muslim parents. Women's groups in Malaysia began campaigning in the 1990s to have female sharia judges appointed to the sharia legal system in the country, and in 2010 two female judges were appointed.|$|E
25|$|Of great {{importance}} to the model building effort of Watson and Crick was Rosalind Franklin's understanding of basic chemistry, which indicated that the hydrophilic phosphate-containing backbones of the nucleotide chains of DNA should be positioned so as to interact with water molecules {{on the outside of}} the molecule while the hydrophobic bases should be packed into the core. Franklin shared this chemical knowledge with Watson and Crick when <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to them that their first model (from 1951, with the phosphates inside) was obviously wrong.|$|E
25|$|Besides the government, the Jan Lokpal {{movement}} was also criticised by some citizens as 'undemocratic' {{on the grounds}} that the ombudsman had powers over elected representatives. Arundhati Roy claimed that the {{movement was}} not a people's movement; instead, it was funded by foreigners to influence policy making in India. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the Ford Foundation had funded the Emergent Leadership category of the Ramon Magsaysay Award, and also donated $397,000 to Kejriwal's NGO Kabir. Both Kejriwal and Ford Foundation termed the allegations as baseless, stating that the donations were made to support the RTI campaigns. Besides, several other Indian organisations had also received grants from the Ford Foundation. Kejriwal also denied the allegations that the movement was a plot against the ruling Congress by the RSS, or that it was an upper-caste conspiracy against the Dalits.|$|E
50|$|Every child, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out,</b> is {{born into}} a {{pre-existing}} parental discourse; and in certain circumstances the alienating burden of parental expectation can block a child's sense of entitlement to its own speech—its own life.|$|R

25|$|Shurley {{found no}} signs of brain damage but {{observed}} a few persistent abnormalities in Genie's sleep, including a significantly reduced amount (and much larger than average variance in duration) of REM sleep and an unusually high number of sleep spindles. He eventually concluded Genie had been mentally disabled from birth, specifically citing her significantly elevated number of sleep spindles. The other scientists following the case remained divided on this issue. Much later, for example, Susan Curtiss emphatically argued that, though Genie clearly had serious emotional difficulties, {{she could not have}} been disabled. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that Genie made a year's developmental progress for every calendar year after her rescue, which would not be expected if her condition was congenital, and that some aspects of language Genie acquired were uncharacteristic of mentally disabled people. She instead believed that Genie was born with at least average intelligence, and that the abuse and isolation of her childhood had left her functionally disabled.|$|E

[...] <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> the lyrics [...] "Explosions on TV and all the girls with heads inside a dream" [...] against M.I.A.'s pop-reggae musical style.

500|$|In mid-1973, Pang {{was working}} on the {{recording}} of Lennon's [...] Mind Games album. Lennon and Ono were having marital problems and decided to separate, and Ono suggested to Pang that she become Lennon's companion. Ono explained that she and Lennon were not getting along, had been arguing and were growing apart, and said that Lennon would start seeing other women. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that Lennon had said he found Pang sexually attractive. Pang replied that she could never start a relationship with Lennon as he was her employer and married. Ono ignored Pang's protests and said that she would arrange everything. Ono later confirmed this conversation in an interview.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} pitched to ABC Entertainment, {{who gave the}} green light, and the show was picked up as a mid-season {{replacement}} for Boston Legal in the 2005 television season. Francie Calfo, {{executive vice president of}} development at ABC Entertainment, commented that ABC was looking for a medical show that was unlike the others airing at the time. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that [...] "edical shows are hard, and it was hard {{trying to figure out where}} ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, [...] found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Kapoor {{has gone}} on record to add, [...] "I would be {{surprised}} if I don't get unbelievable critical acclaim for The Dirty Picture and a national award for my actress, Vidya Balan.

[...] <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the purpose of the film was neither to justify nor criticise Smitha's life but for the audience to live her life.

5000|$|Artist and Activist Kirsty Robertson {{feels that}} the subversive efforts of craftivists against {{capitalism}} are limited by their dependency {{on the internet and}} new communication. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that for this reason, global justice knitters are not completely removed from the economy themselves ...|$|R
500|$|Louise McCudden of Inthenews.co.uk, however, {{argued that}} {{although}} [...] "her voice sounds pleasant [...] the song itself {{is too long}} and becomes tedious fairly fast." [...] Vicki Lutas had a mostly negative review for the song saying [...] "at {{the end of the}} day it does sound like something you could have made up when you were at school", though she did praise the backing track for being [...] "dark, eerie and cold in a chilling way; in an infectious way". However <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that [...] "the vocal arrangement and the actual vocals themselves do nothing more for the song", and respected that [...] "it's a brave song choice, but it's hap-hazard vocal line seems to scream... C-R-I-N-G-E.".|$|E
500|$|She {{became a}} {{professional}} climber in 1988 {{and the subsequent}} interviews, photoshoots and media appearances led to her becoming a spokesperson for climbing. As Hill explained, competition climbing is [...] "such a different activity than going out and climbing on rock... You're {{in front of all}} these people... You're there to perform." [...] From the beginning of her sport climbing career, Hill was aware that the sport was evolving and growing. For example, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> in an interview that some competition organizers would chop down trees and alter rocks {{just for the sake of}} a competition; she could foresee that competitions would all eventually take place on artificial walls for environmental reasons.|$|E
500|$|This {{movie was}} also the subject of comment from feminist critics. Mimi Nguyen says the film [...] "pokes fun at the {{ultimately}} repressive gender roles that seek to make Mulan a domesticated creature". Nadya Labi agreed, saying [...] "there is a lyric in the film that gives the lie to the bravado of the entire girl-power movement." [...] <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that Mulan needed to become a boy {{in order to accomplish}} what she did. Kathleen Karlyn, an assistant professor of English at the University of Oregon, also criticized the film's portrayal of gender roles: [...] "In order to even imagine female heroism, we're placing it in the realm of fantasy". Pam Coats, the producer of Mulan, said that the film aims to present a character who exhibits both masculine and feminine influences, being both physically and mentally strong.|$|E
