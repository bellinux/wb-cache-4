Several cranes were also added while interior improvements were made making the confining environment more livable. A large blower that operated with its own engine was installed which drew fresh air down through the pilothouse. During this time the two Dahlgren guns were each engraved with large letters, MONITOR & MERRIMAC – WORDEN and MONITOR & MERRIMAC – ERICSSON, respectively. Additional iron plates were installed covering where dents were made during the previous battles.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{full-scale}} experiments {{had been}} designed and implemented in wind tunnel to simulate the corridor fire. A combination model with smoke buffer and other smoke-control modes was established {{on the base of}} experiment, and Fire Dynamic Simulation (FDS) was applied to simulate fire in the same conditions. The results reflected that the model is reasonable and viable by compared the simulation results and the experiment dates and the error of the average temperature is about 4. 08 %. Experimental studies also show that in those modes one <b>smoke</b> <b>outlet</b> is needed every 30 m and it is better to set near the ignition source. Its exhaust efficiency is 72. 1 %, better than others; additionally it needs to put up smoke screen to strengthen the smoke exhaust effect. Thus the best combination with smoke-control is perfect in corridor...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: There is {{a paucity}} of {{information}} available on acute respiratory infection (ARI) among school children in India. This study was aimed to assess the prevalence and certain risk factors associated with ARI among school children. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 397 school children age group of 5 - 14 years in the seven schools of rural Puducherry, India. Data on socio-demographic characteristics and associated risk factors of ARI were collected by interview using pre-tested structured questionnaire. Data was analyzed by univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: Overall, 51. 1 % (203) of the subjects {{had at least one}} symptom of ARI in the preceding 2 weeks. The manifestations of ARI included allergic rhinitis (183, 46. 1 %), dry cough (75, 18. 9 %), throat pain and fever (54, 13. 6 %), wheezing (39, 9. 8 %) and ear discharge (28, 7. 1 %). About half of the subjects with ARI (52. 2 %) belonged to 5 - 9 year age group and females (52. 3 %). Mother′s education, family history of allergic disorder and asthma, absence of <b>smoke</b> <b>outlet</b> in kitchen and windows in sleeping room were found to be significantly associated with ARI in univariate analysis (P < 0. 05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that 5 - 9 years age group (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 7), family history of allergic disorder (OR = 9. 6) and asthma (OR = 5. 2), presence of <b>smoke</b> <b>outlet</b> in kitchen (OR = 0. 5), absence of windows in sleeping room (OR = 3. 0) were found to have an independent association with the ARI. About 29. 6 % (60) of the subjects with ARI had accessed health care facility for treatment. Conclusion: ARI among school children is an important health problem. Interventions like provision of smoke outlets and windows in sleeping room may help in reduction of burden of ARI...|$|E

40|$|Detecting and {{extinguishing}} fires, {{along with}} post-fire atmospheric cleaning and monitoring, are vital {{components of a}} spacecraft fire response system. Preliminary efforts focused on the technology evaluation of these systems under realistic conditions are described in this paper. While the primary objective of testing is to determine a smoke mitigation filter s performance, supplemental evaluations measuring the smoke-filled chamber handheld commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) atmospheric monitoring devices (combustion product monitors) are also conducted. The test chamber consists of a 1. 4 cubic meter (50 cu. ft.) volume containing a smoke generator. The fuel used to generate the smoke {{is a mixture of}} polymers in quantities representative of materials involved in a circuit board fire as a typical spacecraft fire. Two fire conditions were examined: no flame and flame. No flame events are produced by pyrolyzing the fuel mixture in a quartz tube furnace with forced ventilation to produce a white, lingering-type smoke. Flame events ignite the <b>smoke</b> at the <b>outlet</b> of the tube furnace producing combustion characterized by a less opaque smoke with black soot. Electrochemical sensor measurements showed carbon monoxide is a major indicator of each fire. Acid gas measurements were recorded, but cross interferents are currently uncharacterized. Electrochemical sensor measurements and sample acquisition techniques from photoacoustic sensors are being improved. Overall, this research shows fire characterization using traditional analytical chemistry techniques is required to verify measurements recorded using COTS atmospheric monitoring devices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The smoke {{characteristics}} of tunnel fire are preliminarily {{concerned with the}} heat release, the tunnel geometry, <b>smoke</b> <b>outlet</b> geometry, etc. However, the study on smoke {{characteristics of}} tunnel fire with different cross passage interval is relatively less at present. Base on the physical model of a large scale cross-section road tunnel, this paper carried out simulation and analysis on the smoke flow of several fire scenarios under different cross passage interval through FDS 5. 4. 3. The results demonstrated that in a certain extent while the cross passage interval was less than 400 m, the longer the cross passage interval was, the longer {{the time when the}} smoke began to counter flow in the tunnel and the longer the length of counter-flow smoke. If the cross passage interval was beyond this scope, the time that the smoke began to counter flow and the length of counter-flow smoke tended respectively to be the same...|$|E
40|$|Background: Asthma in {{childhood}} {{is a major}} public health issue. Objective: To estimate prevalence and associated housing environment factors of asthma among school children. Material & Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study among school children aged six to fifteen years. Standard ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children) Core Questionnaire for Asthma was used for determining the prevalence of wheezing and asthma. Demographic, housing and indoor pollution factors were collected. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 15. Results: Prevalence of ‘wheeze ever’ and ‘current wheezers’ was 10 % and 9 % respectively.   Physician diagnosed asthma was seen in 6. 3 %. Severe asthma was noted in 28. 6 % of current wheezerswith 84. 6 % and 8. 8 % having one to two and four to 12 wheezing attacks per year respectively. Wheezing was present post exercise in 5. 4 %, nocturnal cough in 6. 1 %, sleep disturbance less than one night/week (40. 7 %), one or more nights/week (3. 3 %) and wheezing limiting speech to few words between breaths (20. 9 %). Prevalence was greater among boys (9. 8 %) than girls (7. 5 %) and maximal in age group eight to nine years. On multiple logistic regression presence of overcrowding and absence of <b>smoke</b> <b>outlet</b> {{were significantly associated with}} current wheeze. Socio-economic status, beedi rolling practices and absence of separate kitchen was statistically significant with severe asthma. Conclusions: Current wheezer prevalence was 9 % and more in boys. Adoption of improved housing conditions and avoiding environmental tobacco exposure may aid in reducing childhood asthma attacks in this developing city...|$|E
40|$|Fast growing fires inside {{compartments}} {{with limited}} paths for expanded gases to escape {{leads to a}} rapid pressure rise. High pressure can cause smoke to flow through supply vents into the adjacent rooms and can also cause structural damage. In Finland, apartments are fitted with a distinctive double door system and the inner door opens inwards into the apartment. The opening of this door could be difficult under high pressure conditions {{and the effect of}} pressure on egress possibilities of occupants was an issue of discussion in Finland. Extensive studies have not been made to better understand the influence of ventilation networks on pressure and smoke spread possibilities. The main objective of this thesis work is to investigate the development of pressure during fires in residential buildings and the influence of ventilation networks on pressure and smoke spread through buildings. It also aims to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the CFD code, Fire Dynamics Simulator for modelling HVAC networks and provide fire safety designers with guidelines to model and simulate pressure development and ventilation system response. The first phase of studies deals with the validation of the HVAC module in FDS. The Swedish-FOA experimental studies of pressure rise in compartments and smoke spread via ventilation ducts are used as validation cases. The FOA experiments were conducted in a sealed test chamber of size 4. 0 m x 5. 5 m x 2. 6 m with different opening diameters to model leakage and different ventilation configurations. In {{the second phase of the}} thesis work, fire tests were carried out in a 1970 s apartment building. Different types of fire situations were created by altering the ventilation duct configurations. The pressure, gas temperatures in the room, gas concentrations and <b>outlet</b> <b>smoke</b> temperatures were measured and the effects of fire pressure in the ventilation networks were studied. The leakage rates of the test apartment were determined using a multi-point blower door test. A numerical simulation of these tests were performed using FDS. The studies show that the pressures developed during a compartment fire can be high enough to pose risk to the safety of its inhabitants and also cause significant damage to property. It was also found that the ventilation systems play an important role in relieving the fire pressure. The possibility of egress of occupants is compromised as opening the inner door became difficult. The FDS validation model predictions of temperatures and pressure rise in compartment fires are within the range of acceptable uncertainty...|$|R
