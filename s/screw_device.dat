40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{resistance}} of intramedullary single <b>screw</b> <b>device</b> (Gamma nail) and double <b>screw</b> <b>device</b> proximal femoral nail (PFN) in unstable trochanteric fractures in terms of the number of cycles sustained, subsidence and implant failure in an axial loading test in cadaveric femora. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 18 dry cadaveric femoral specimens, 9 of these were implanted with a Gamma nail and 9 with PFN. There was no significant difference found in average dual energy X-ray absorptiometry value between both groups. The construct was made unstable (AO type 31 A 3. 3) by removing a standard sized posteromedial wedge. These were tested on a cyclic physiological loading machine at 1 cycle/s with a load of 200 kg. The test was observed for 50, 000 loading cycles or until implant failure, whichever occurred earlier. Peak displacements were measured and analysis was done to determine construct stiffness and gap micromotion in axial loading. Result: It was observed that there was statistically significant difference in terms of displacement at the fracture gap and overall construct stiffness of specimens of both groups. PFN construct group showed a mean subsidence of 1. 02 mm and Gamma nail construct group showed mean subsidence of 2. 36 mm after cycling. The average stiffness of Gamma nail group was 62. 8 ΁ 8. 4 N/mm which was significantly lower than average stiffness of the PFN group (80. 4 ΁ 5. 9 N/mm) (P = 0. 03). In fatigue testing, 1 out of 9 PFN bone construct failed, while 5 of 9 Gamma nail bone construct failed. Conclusion: When considering micromotion (subsidence) and incidence of implant/screw failure, double <b>screw</b> <b>device</b> (PFN) had statistically significant lower micromotion across the fracture gap with axial compression and lower incidence of implant failure. Hence, double <b>screw</b> <b>device</b> (PFN) construct had higher stability compared to single <b>screw</b> <b>device</b> (GN) in an unstable trochanteric fracture femur model...|$|E
30|$|Pertrochanteric {{fractures}} {{are common}} problems in elderly patients. Operative stabilization permits early mobilization and minimizes complications of prolonged recumbency [1]. Stable pertrochanteric fractures are preferably fixed by sliding hip screws [2, 3, 4]. In general, {{for the treatment}} of unstable pertrochanteric fractures, two options exist: extramedullary or intramedullary stabilization [5]. Each device has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of extramedullary fixation, such as dynamic hip screw (DHS), is the relatively simple, safe and forgiving surgical technique [5]. The DHS remains the implant of choice because of its favourable results and low rates of non-union or hardware failure [2, 3, 4], but the complication rates of the DHS are higher in unstable pertrochanteric fractures; despite the widespread use of the DHS, cut-out rates of 5 – 17  % {{have been reported in the}} literature [3, 6, 7, 8]. The most common mode of failure of a DHS is cut-out of the lag screw from the femoral head [9, 10] followed by lift-off of the plate from the femur [3, 4, 11]. Wolfgang et al. [12] reported a 19  % mechanical and technical complication rate with unstable pertrochanteric fractures treated with sliding hip <b>screw</b> <b>device.</b> Moreover, osteoporosis, associated with pertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients, also presents a problem for stable osteosynthesis of the fracture [13].|$|E

Hypothesis: Use of a central four-quadrant sleeve and screw provides superior fixation when compared with standard interference screw fixation. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: In eight pairs of cadaveric knees each anterior cruciate ligament was reconstructed using either an interference screw or a central sleeve and screw on the tibial side. The specimens were then subjected to cyclic loading followed by a load-to-failure test. Results: The load required to cause 1 and 2 mm of graft laxity, defined as {{the separation of the}} femur and the tibia at the points of graft fixation, was significantly greater with the sleeve and screw than with the interference screw (at 2 mm: sleeve and screw, 216. 1 30. 1 N; interference screw, 167. 0 33. 2 N). The force at initial slippage for each of the graft strands was significantly higher with use of the central sleeve and screw. Conclusions: The four-quadrant sleeve and <b>screw</b> <b>device</b> may provide greater surface area for healing of hamstring tendon grafts and allow equal tensioning of graft strands before fixation.

Materials and Methods: A 3 -dimensional {{model of the}} maxillary dentition was designed for the study. A retraction force of 410 and 200 g was applied to simulate the forces generated by the hycon device and an active tie back respectively. The stresses generated by these forces were evaluated on the periodontium at cervix, mid root and apical region. Results: In the present study, maximum amount of tensile stresses {{were found on the}} labio-cervical (0. 4919 and 0. 2945 MPa) aspects of canine, compressive stresses on the linguo-cervical (− 0. 1758 and − 0. 0679 MPa) aspect of the 2 nd premolar and the apical region of all teeth showed low magnitude compressive stresses, with both the loads. The displacement produced by the retraction screw was of the magnitude 0. 172 - 0. 183 mm (0. 177 mm) in the anterior segment and 0. 0065 - 0. 007822 mm (0. 0071 mm) in the posteriors (anchor loss). Active tie backs produce a displacement of 0. 162 - 0. 172 mm in the anterior segment and a negligible amount of displacement in the posteriors. Conclusions: Even though the stress level in the periodontium produced by hycon device was almost 2 - 3 times that of active tie backs, the displacement produced per activation was within the physiological limits and less than the width of the periodontium (0. 20 - 0. 25 mm), which in turn induces bone remodeling...|$|E
30|$|The {{treatment}} of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in elderly osteopenic patients, {{especially those who}} cannot follow limited weight bearing instructions, is controversial. Recent publications indicate concern with excessive sliding of telescoping nail or sliding <b>screw</b> <b>devices</b> when used in these unstable intertrochanteric fractures. In our experience {{with the use of}} intramedullary hip screw (IMHS) in these fracture patterns, we have observed excessive sliding and collapse of the fracture in some patients. We modified the keyed centering sleeve by threading its internal distal third and substituted the compression screw with a custom bolt to obtain restricted sliding or rigid fixation depending on the gap between the lag screw and custom bolt. We used this modified system in static configuration to treat five patients who had an unstable intertrochanteric fracture of the femur. The length of the involved limb measured at the time of consolidation showed no shortening. In view of these results, intertrochanteric hip fractures that are unstable in patients with poor bone-stock can be fixed using the modified IMHS in a static or controlled sliding configuration.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the influence of fracture stability on early patient mortality and complications requiring reoperation after trochanteric hip fracture. Design: Prospective consecutive cohort study. Setting: The orthopaedic unit of a public teaching hospital. Participants: Seven hundred twenty-eight patients with 743 consecutive stable (n = 446) pertrochanteric and unstable (n = 297) pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric fractures (median age: 84 years, 71 % females) resulting from a low-impact injury and surgically managed. Mean follow-up of surviving patients was 4 years (range: 2 - 6 years). Intervention: Fracture fixation by dynamic hip screw extramedullary device or intramedullary nail (Austofix or Gamma 3) based on surgeon preference. Main Outcome Measures: Mortality within 6 and 12 months and surgical complications requiring device reoperation within 12 months of surgery (multivariate logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses). Results: Patients with unstable fractures were at 1. 61 times (95 % confidence interval: 1. 18 - 2. 21, P = 0. 003) and 1. 37 times (95 % confidence interval: 1. 02 - 1. 83, P = 0. 037) greater odds of dying within 6 and 12 months, respectively, than those with stable fractures. Older age, male gender, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, in residential care, and inpatient-reported medical complications were also independent risk factors for early mortality. Increasing fracture instability and fixation using the Austofix nail were associated with early device reoperation. Comparable results were reported for the dynamic hip screw and Gamma 3 nail, although the Gamma 3 nail may offer advantages for more complex unstable fractures. Conclusions: Fracture instability influences early mortality after surgical fixation of trochanteric hip fracture. The Austofix double lag <b>screw</b> <b>device</b> had suboptimal results.

40|$|Surgical {{treatment}} of hip fractures is frequently associated with secondary fracture displacement, {{in part due}} to weak osteoporotic bone. So far, improvements have focused on new metal implants although an alternative could be to augment the bone that surrounds the implant. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the use of calcium phosphate cement (Norian SRS) for augmentation of internally fixed hip fractures. Norian SRS is an injectable, biocompatible cement that hardens in situ without exothermic reaction. Over time it is remodeled and replaced by host bone. In a biomechanical study the holding characteristics for different implants was measured when inserted with or without augmentation. The study showed that conventional bone cement (PMMA) improved maximum torque and pull-out for almost all modalities while Norian SRS increased the holding power mainly in low-density bone. In a prospective and randomized study, patients with displaced femoral neck fractures were operated with internal fixation using screws alone or combined with Norian SRS for augmentation. The result showed improved stability when measured with radiostereometry (RSA) for the augmented fractures during the early rehabilitation period. The clinical evaluation of 118 patients included pain, walking aid, activities of daily living (ADLs), abductor muscle strength, mobility and range of motion. During the early course the augmented patients did better in some variables although over the total two-year study period there was no major difference between groups. Scintigraphic evaluation indicated that augmentation might compromise the circulation to the femoral head. The final part included unstable trochanteric fractures fixed with a sliding <b>screw</b> <b>device</b> alone or the same device combined with Norian SRS for augmentation. Using RSA it was shown that augmentation significantly improved the fracture stability until healing. In a randomized multicenter study including 112 patients, augmentation with Norian SRS reduced pain during early rehabilitation and improved quality of life until healing. In conclusion, augmentation with Norian SRS improved the early fracture stability in displaced femoral neck fractures while there was no major difference in clinical outcome. In unstable trochanteric fractures augmentation provided improved fracture stability and improved clinical course until healing...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{energy in}} the UK is {{currently}} undergoing a period of exponential growth in terms of development and implementation. The current installed tidal energy capacity of around 4 MW {{is expected to rise}} to provide up to 20 % of the UK’s electricity demand by 2050 [5]. With this in mind, there is a huge range of energy devices, all seemingly promoted by their developers as the best method of extracting power from the ocean. Embodied energy is an important aspect of any power producing device or process, and is used to describe the amount of energy required to begin and maintain the process of energy generation. Until a device or process has generated this amount of energy it cannot be said to be a net contributor of energy. This work used Life Cycle Assessment to study four tidal energy devices, representing a cross section of the existing designs, and compares their embodied energy and carbon dioxide emissions. In order to ensure a fair comparison, a hypothetical installation site is used, with conditions typical of those found at potential array installation sites in the UK. The designs studied include a multi-blade turbine, two three blade horizontal axis turbine machines, and an Archimedes’ <b>screw</b> <b>device.</b> These machines were chosen to represent a cross section of device, foundation, installation and operation designs. They have all been developed to prototype stage, meaning that actual manufacturing data is available. Embodied energy is considered over the entire lifetime of each device, beginning with extraction of raw materials. Energy use from fabrication, transport, installation, lifetime maintenance, end-of-life decommissioning and recycling are all calculated, and compared to the energy generation from each device at the test site. Finally, the embodied energy; CO 2 intensity; and energy payback periods are compared to those of conventional power generating systems as well as other renewable energy sources. A range of data sources are used. Embodied energy of steel has been provided by the World Steel Association. Of the four devices studied, all were found to achieve CO 2 and energy payback within the first 12 years of their lifetime, and exhibited CO 2 intensity of between 18 and 35 gCO 2 /kWh. This compares favourably to many current energy sources, and is likely to fall as technology improves, array size increases and industry experience progresses...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to research, design and build a shoe press for a local company called Soft Star Shoes. Soft Star Shoes were looking for {{different}} ways to replace their barging process, which {{is the process of}} attaching the rubber sole of the shoe to the upper leather. To perform this process, Soft Star Shoes used hammering, which was physically straining, caused operators to get frustrated, as well as, slowed the production process. After receiving the problem description and customer requirements, a decision to go with an automated press was made. The team researched existing shoe presses to use as benchmarks in the design process. The team then performed ergonomic analysis to understand the severity of the problem, and stress-strain and reliability analyses to find maximum loads, and fracturing points. In addition, the team interviewed Soft Star Shoes barge employees to determine the requirements that needed to be met for the press to be considered a good replacement for the hammering process. Using this information, the team designed and built a shoe press that meets the customer’s needs. The new device is a 17 ” by 17 ” by 12 ” press that is held by five vertical columns. These columns are attached to two 0. 5 ” thick steel plates (one on the top and one on the bottom). The press is powered using a 115 V ball <b>screw</b> <b>device,</b> which is inserted {{through a hole in the}} top steel plate, and carries a 14 ” x 14 ” x 0. 5 ” pressing plate. The device travels a vertical distance of 10 ” to perform the pressing process. Tests were started upon finishing the design process. The tests were conducted based on the engineering requirements generated. The press passed all these tests, which meant that the team has achieved the sponsor’s needs. However, the project was not done at that point. The press was dirty and the steel was rusted. So cosmetic operations were performed. Cleaning, Painting and adding lights to the press were a critical factor in delivering a good-looking press. After completing the cosmetics, the press was delivered to the sponsoring company. Furthermore, the press had a big impact on Soft Star Shoes’ production floor. It allowed the company to replace the existing barging process, which improved their ergonomic rating, as well as, their shoe output. Operators did not need to apply any physical force to barge the shoes, which reduced the chances of musculoskeletal disorders within the company’s walls.

30|$|The {{treatment}} of proximal femoral fractures using fixed angled implants was succeeded by sliding <b>screw</b> <b>devices</b> which produced {{an improvement in}} union rates and fewer fixation and implant failures [12, 15]. A meta-analysis of 14 studies with 3, 069 patients showed {{an increased risk of}} cut-out (13 % vs. 4 %), non-union (2 vs. 0.5 %), implant breakage (14 vs. 0.7 %) and re-operation (10 vs. 4 %) for fixed nail plates in comparison with the sliding implants [8]. In addition patients treated with fixed nail plates had a higher mortality rate and survivors more likely to have residual hip pain and impaired mobility. For the past 3 decades the use of sliding screw implants for the fixation of proximal femoral fractures has been almost universal. Two main designs are popular; an extramedullary device (e.g., the Dynamic Hip Screw, DHS) and an intramedullary device (the Gamma nail and equivalent cephalo-medullary constructs). Both types achieve fixation in the femoral head with one or two sliding screws. Extensive clinical investigation has failed to show that either type of device is superior although there is the suggestion that intramedullary devices may be biomechanically more stable [2, 3, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28].|$|R

40|$|Dynamic Screw Systems {{are useful}} in {{proximal}} and distal femoral fractures, and convey advantages over fixed angle devices. Improved proximal fragment fixation, controlled fracture impaction and a “forgiveness” with respect to axial alignment of the side plate to bone are improvements over fixed angle devices. Image intensifiers are often required to aid lag screw alignment when these devices are used. The equipments are expensive and often not available in some regions of the developing world. There is also the risk of radiation exposure to the surgical team. The burden of musculoskeletal trauma is enormous {{in the developing world}} and treatment outcomes are influenced by a host of factors.
