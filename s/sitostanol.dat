40|$|BACKGROUND: In vitro {{and animal}} studies have {{suggested}} that plant sterols and stanols increase cytokine production by T-helper- 1 cells. This may be beneficial for patient groups characterized by a T-helper- 2 dominant immune response, e. g. asthma patients. (1) to evaluate whether <b>sitostanol</b> induces a T-helper- 1 shift in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from asthma patients, and (2) to unravel the role of regulatory T-cells in this respect. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PBMCs from 10 asthma patients and 10 healthy subjects were isolated and incubated with 1. 2 µM <b>sitostanol,</b> while stimulated with 5 µg/ml PHA. Similar amounts of cholesterol were used to determine whether effects were specific for plant stanols or for sterols in general. Changes in cytokine production were measured using antibody arrays and ELISAs. Changes in regulatory T-cell population size were measured by flow cytometry, using intracellular Foxp 3 staining. <b>Sitostanol</b> increased production of IFNγ by 6. 5 % and IL- 2 by 6. 0 % compared to cholesterol (p< 0. 01). No changes in IL- 4 and IL- 13 were found. Interestingly, this effect was only present in PBMCs from asthma patients. The number of Foxp 3 + cells tended to increase and their activity, measured by IL- 10 production, increased after <b>sitostanol</b> treatment in PBMCs from asthma patients compared to controls by 32. 3 % (p = 0. 077) and 13. 3 % (p< 0. 05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, the sitostanol-induced Thelper- 1 shift in PBMCs from asthma patients and the stimulating effects of <b>sitostanol</b> on Treg cell numbers and activity indicate a possible novel approach for plant stanol ester enriched functional foods in the amelioration of asthmatic symptoms. Functional effects, however, require further evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The dietary {{impact of}} {{specific}} phytosterols incorporated into phytosterol fatty acid esters {{has not been}} elucidated. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that phytosterol esters containing different sterol moieties (sitosterol, <b>sitostanol,</b> or stigmasterol) but the same fatty acid moiety (stearic acid) produce different effects on cholesterol metabolism. Male Syrian hamsters were fed sitosterol, <b>sitostanol,</b> and stigmasterol stearate esters (25 g/kg diet) in an atherogenic diet containing cholesterol (1. 2 g/kg) and coconut oil (80 g/kg). The phytosterol stearates produced no decrease in cholesterol absorption or plasma non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol despite a reduction in liver free cholesterol in hamsters fed both sitosterol and <b>sitostanol</b> stearate diets. In addition, sitosterol stearate significantly increased fecal esterified and total neutral sterol excretion. Stigmasterol stearate {{did not differ from}} control in neutral sterol excretion, plasma lipids, or hepatic lipid concentration. Sitosterol stearate demonstrated the highest level of net intestinal hydrolysis, whereas <b>sitostanol</b> and stigmasterol stearate equivalently demonstrated the lowest. The cholesterol-lowering effect in liver—but not plasma—and the limited presence of fecal free sterols indicate that intact (unhydrolyzed) phytosterol stearates may impact cholesterol metabolism by mechanisms unrelated to the role of free phytosterols. The consumption of phytosterol esters at 2. 5 % of the diet elicited only modest impacts on cholesterol metabolism, although sitosterol stearate had a slightly greater therapeutic impact by lowering liver free cholesterol and increasing esterified and total neutral sterol fecal excretion, possibly due to a greater level of intestinal hydrolysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{cholesterol-lowering}} {{effect of}} corn fiber oil, {{obtained from the}} seed coats of corn kernels, has been reported previously. Corn fiber oil contains phytosteryl fatty acyl esters, ferulate phytostanyl esters, and free phytosterols. To date, however, no {{studies have examined the}} cholesterol-lowering efficacy of ferulate phytostanyl esters. Moreover, although plant stanols and sterols have been established as cholesterol-lowering agents over the past five decades, their exact mechanisms of action are not clearly understood. One of the possible mechanism is that plant sterols/stanols disrupts the normal sub-cellular cholesterol absorption by down-regulation of the influx sterol transporters such as the Niemann pick C 1 like 1 (NPC 1 L 1) protein and/or up-regulation of efflux sterol transporters such as the ATP binding cassette (ABC) G 5 and ABCG 8 protein. Hence, the objectives of this thesis were to assess the efficacy of corn fiber oil, ferulate phytostanyl esters and their parent compounds including <b>sitostanol</b> and ferulic acid, on plasma cholesterol levels. Further, objectives were to investigate their impact on parameters of cholesterol kinetics and gene expression of sterol transporters to obtain insight into their role in genetic control of regulation of cholesterol flux. Results of this experiment demonstrate that the hypocholesterolemic effect of corn fiber oil is mostly due to <b>sitostanol,</b> while esterification of ferulic acid and <b>sitostanol</b> yields no apparent synergistic cholesterol lowering effect. Present data exhibited a cholesterol absorption lowering effect of corn fiber oil and <b>sitostanol</b> and suggest that this effect may be due to up-regulation of intestinal enterocyte efflux sterol transporters such as ABCG 5 and ABCG 8...|$|E
40|$|Phytosterols occur {{naturally}} in the non-saponifiable material of plant oils. <b>Sitostanol,</b> the saturated derivative of beta-sitosterol, {{is found in}} negligible concentrations in plant sources and, hence, is almost absent from typical Western diets. Tall oil extracts, on the other hand, contain about 20 % (w/w) <b>sitostanol.</b> Phytosterols {{have been shown to}} lower plasma total cholesterol levels in animals and humans while <b>sitostanol</b> exhibited stronger reducing effects. Several studies have suggested that phytosterols lower plasma total cholesterol levels by either inhibiting cholesterol absorption or altering the activities of enzymes critical in cholesterol metabolism and excretion. However, results obtained demonstrate inconsistency regarding the effects of phytosterols on cholesterol absorption rates and cholesterogenesis. In addition, few studies have determined quantitatively the changes in the rate of cholesterol absorption and biosynthesis. Hence, the objective of this thesis was to investigate further the impact of different sources of phytosterols on plasma lipid profiles and to develop a new methodology for simultaneous measurement of percent cholesterol absorption and cholesterol synthesis rates in animals and humans. The stable isotopes, 13 C-, 18 O-cholesterol, and deuterium oxide were utilized for the dual isotope plasma ratio and deuterium uptake methodologies. Results from the series of animal experiments conducted demonstrate (i) a gender effect of phytosterols in modulating plasma lipid profile in hamsters, (ii) that <b>sitostanol</b> was more potent in lowering plasma and hepatic lipid concentrations than beta-sitosterol in hamsters and rabbits and (iii) that this lowering effect was due to a reduction in fractional cholesterol absorption and an increase in cholesterol excretion rates. Concomitantly, an up-regulation in cholesterogenesis was observed in hamsters. Furthermore, in humans tall oil phytosterols lowered total cholesterol levels in hypercholesterol...|$|E
40|$|Plant sterols {{may induce}} a Th 1 shift in humans. However, whether plant stanols have similar effects {{as well as}} the {{underlying}} mechanism are unknown. We have now shown that (like sitosterol) <b>sitostanol,</b> both 4 -desmethylsterols, induces a Th 1 shift when added in vitro at physiological concentrations to human PBMCs. This conclusion was based on a higher IFNγ production, with no change in the production of IL- 4 and IL- 10. α-Amyrin, a 4. 4 -dimethylsterol, had comparable effects. Because 4. 4 -dimethylsterols cannot activate transcription factor LXR, this finding indicates that LXR activation was not involved. Sitosterol and <b>sitostanol</b> did not alter the production of IL- 12 and IL- 18 in PBMCs as well as in monocyte-derived U 937 cells, suggesting that plant sterols directly affect T-helper cells, without activating APCs. However, in PBMCs treated with a TLR 2 blocker (T 2. 5), IFNγ production was completely inhibited, whereas blocking TLR 4 with HTA 125 had no such effect. To confirm these findings, PBMCs from TLR 2 −/− mice were cultured in the presence of sitosterol and <b>sitostanol.</b> In these cells, no Th 1 shift was observed. Our results, therefore, indicate that TLR 2 activation is essential to induce a Th 1 shift in human PBMCs by plant stanols and plant sterols...|$|E
40|$|Phytosterols are lipid {{components}} of all food items of plant origin. They {{are effective in}} decreasing plasma cholesterol concentrations, but have also been suggested to protect against colorectal cancer. The overall aims of the thesis were to describe and compare the physiological response after ingestion of two esterified sources of phytosterols, soy sterols and <b>sitostanol</b> from wood oil, and to describe the dietary intake of phytosterols with special emphasis on its relation to colorectal cancer risk. Seven ileostomy subjects consumed a controlled diet during three randomized periods of 3 days each. A controlled basal diet was served in all periods, and {{in two of the}} periods, 2. 5 g of soy sterol esters or <b>sitostanol</b> ester were added. Effluent bags were gathered during the second and third day, pooled together from each 24 h-period, and analyzed for neutral and acidic sterols. Cholesterol absorption was measured by the classical double label method. The results showed that soy sterol esters and <b>sitostanol</b> ester decreased cholesterol absorption from 58 % in the control period, to 39 and 38 %, respectively. The esterification of the unsaturated and saturated phytosterols gave them similar inhibiting properties on cholesterol absorption. The study showed no significant decrease in sterol excretion, which might be due to low power of the study. A database on the phytosterol content of different foods was developed for use in epidemiological studies. It was applied {{within the framework of the}} Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer among 120, 852 subjects who completed a baseline questionnaire in 1986. After 6. 3 years of follow-up, 620 colon and 344 rectal cancer cases were detected. A case-cohort approach was used to calculate confounder adjusted rate ratios (RR) and the 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for quintiles of phytosterol intake. The major sources were bread (38 %), vegetable fats (26 %), and fruits and vegetables (21 %). For men and women, there was no clear association between intake of any of the phytosterols and colon cancer risk when adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol, family history of colorectal cancer, education, and cholecystectomy. Energy adjustment did not alter the results. For rectal cancer in men, energy adjustment gave positive associations for campesterol and stigmasterol. For women, no association was observed between the dietary intake of any of the phytosterols and rectal cancer risk...|$|E
40|$|Phytosterols play an {{important}} role in nature and as synthetic supplements for the modification of cholesterol metabolism in humans. The consensus is that the primary mechanism by which phytosterols modify lipid profiles is through altering the absorption of cholesterol. This thesis examined the effects of phytosterol mixtures on (i) de novo cholesterol synthesis rates and appearance of de novo cholesterol into the cholesterol ester pool through the use of deuterium incorporation, as well as, (ii) plasma lipid and sterol concentrations in normolipidemic humans. The initial investigation of this thesis compared the effects of diets based on either corn oil, olive oil, or olive oil plus phytosterol mixture on cholesterol metabolism. Each treatment was administered for 10 days in a cross-over design to 16 normolipidemic humans. In addition to confirming prior conclusions that corn oil was more effective than olive oil at decreasing plasma total and LDL-cholesterol concentration, this study was one of the first to determine that the differential effects on cholesterol metabolism observed in humans consuming corn versus olive oil is due, in part, to the higher concentrations of plant sterols naturally found in corn oil. The second study presented in this thesis investigated the differential effects on sterol metabolism of phytosterol mixtures either enriched with <b>sitostanol</b> or sitostanol-free administered for 10 days in 11 normolipidemic humans. The results of this study demonstrated that only the phytosterol mixture containing low doses of <b>sitostanol</b> decreased plasma total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations and increased the circulating HDL/LDL ratios; thus, the sitostanol-enriched phytosterol mixture was a more effective cholesterol-lowering agent...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this study, the {{capacity}} of oysters to bioaccumulate fecal stanols and to record a source-specificfingerprint was investigated by the short-term contamination of seawater microcosms containing oysterswith a human effluent.

Although stanol fingerprints of contaminated waterallowed the identification of the human specific fingerprint, this was not the case for oysters. This discrepancyis attributed to (i) high concentrations of endogenous cholestanol and <b>sitostanol,</b> responsiblefor ‘‘unbalanced’’ stanol fingerprints, (ii) different accumulation/depuration kinetics of fecal coprostanoland 24 -ethylcoprostanol and (iii) the limits of the analytical pathway used.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} {{to examine the effects of}} sitosterol and <b>sitostanol</b> supplementation on plasma cholesterol levels and cholesterol metabolism in hypercholesterolemic subjects consuming a fixed foods diet in a four-phase crossover design. It was hypothesized that addition of either phytosterols, phytostenols, or a 50 : 50 mixture of sterols and stanols to butter would reduce circulating cholesterol levels, despite butter's hypercholesterolemic effect, through actions involving cholesterol absorption, synthesis, and turnover rates. The data obtained indicate that in their free, unesterified form, plant sterols and stanols lower plasma LDL cholesterol equivalently in hypercholesterolemic subjects. Results of this study provide new data that phytosterols and stanols function by suppressing cholesterol absorption while increasing cholesterol synthesis, however, the de-suppression in synthesis cannot fully compensate for the decrease in absorption making the treatment effective, thus may assist in the development of a food which offers health-promoting advantages related to the prevention of cardiovascular disease...|$|E

Therefore there is an urgent need to identify novel interventions to combat hepatic inflammation. In mice, omitting cholesterol from the diet reduced hepatic inflammation. Considering the effects of plant sterol/stanol esters on cholesterol metabolism, we hypothesized that plant sterol/stanol esters reduces hepatic inflammation. Indeed, adding plant sterol/stanol esters to a high-fat-diet reduced hepatic inflammation as indicated by immunohistochemical stainings and gene expression for inflammatory markers. Finally, adding sterol/stanol esters lowered hepatic concentrations of cholesterol precursors lathosterol and desmosterol in mice, which were highly elevated in the HFD group similarly as observed in severely obese patients with NASH. In vitro, in isolated LPS stimulated bone marrow derived macrophages desmosterol activated cholesterol efflux whereas <b>sitostanol</b> reduced inflammation.

40|$|Sterols are {{important}} lipids {{related to the}} quality of olive oil and broadly used for checking its genuineness. Recent analyses have identified that some Australian olive oils would not meet international standards for total content of sterols or for certain individual components.

In this work the horticultural and processing practices that may {{have an impact on the}} sterol content and profile of the most important Australian varieties were analysed. The information generated with this study aims to solve a legislation problem as well as maximising the nutritional and health benefits of Australian olive oils. The evaluation was undertaken using three different varieties and the processing practices evaluated were: irrigation, fruit size, maturity, malaxing time, malaxing temperature and delays between harvest and process. The total content of sterols and their composition in olive oil is strongly influenced by genetic factors and year.

This is one of the goals of the present chapter, which aims to revise the most recent scientific literature to look for updates regarding the food sources of phytosterols, as a complement to the information more generally available. Both stanols and sterols are essential components of plant cell membranes and structurally resemble cholesterol. In fact, cholesterol is also a sterol, but, unlike plant sterols, it is predominantly of animal origin, being synthesized in the human liver. Because the bioactive effects of phytosterols are much associated to their chemical structure, also this aspect is addressed in the present chapter, by presenting the chemistry of the different molecules of the phytosterols...|$|E

The histopathological analysis showed that the treatment with the ethanolic extract prior to CCl 4 administration prevented significantly the architectural disorder of seminiferous epithelium and germ cell exfoliation. The phytochemical study allowed the identification of known phenolic and aliphatic compounds [ethyl linolenoate (1), <b>sitostanol</b> (2), octadecyl (3) and eicosanyl (4) (E) -ferulates, ethyl (E) - 2 -hydroxycinnamate (5), scopoletin (6), a triacylglycerol of tetracosanoic acid (7) ], and three new compounds: saliramoester, a long chain triester (8), saliramophenone, a propiophenone derivative (9) and saliramopyrrole a pyrrole- 3 -carbaldehyde derivative (10).

Other minor triacylglycerols were 2, 3 -dioleyl- 1 -stearoylglycerol (SOO), 2 -oleyl- 3 -palmitoyl- 1 -stearoylglycerol (SOP), 1 -linolenoyl- 2 -oleyl- 3 -palmitoylglycerol (LnOP), 1, 2 -dilinoleyl- 3 -palmitoylglycerol (LLP), 1, 3 -dioleyl- 2 -linolenoylglycerol (OLnO), 1 -linolenoyl- 2 -linoleyl- 3 -oleylglycerol (LnLO) and 1, 2, 3 -trilinoleylglycerol (LLL). The sterol profile of Tunisian virgin olive oils produced from Oueslati cultivar was established by gas chromatography using a flame ionisation detector (GC-MS). More than 10 compounds were identified and characterised.

At {{the age of}} 8 weeks, they received an oral gavage consisting of 0. 25 mg cholesterol + 50 mg plant stanol esters dissolved in olive oil. Animals were euthanized at different time points. In a second comparable set-up, mesenteric lymph-cannulated versus sham-operated mice received the same oral gavage, which was now deuterium labeled. Intestinal and hepatic <b>sitostanol</b> concentrations increased within 15 min post-gavage. This rapid hepatic appearance was absent in lymph-cannulated mice, suggesting a very fast lymph-mediated uptake. Hepatic mRNA expression of SREBP 2 and its target genes rapidly decreased, whereas expression of LXR target genes increased. The intestinal SREBP 2 pathway was increased, whereas the expression of LXR target genes hardly changed. The fivefold and sixfold increased expression of intestinal LDLr and PCSK 9 is suggestive of TICE activation.

The fact that the application of brassinolide restored the growth of the mutant indicated that the dwarf mutant lk is brassinosteroid deficient. Gas chromatography-selected ion monitoring analysis of the endogenous sterols in lk shoots revealed that the levels of campestanol and <b>sitostanol</b> were reduced 160 - and 10 -fold, respectively, {{compared with those of}} wild-type plants.

40|$|Phytosterols (plant sterols and stanols) are {{naturally}} occurring compounds which {{are found in}} all foods of plant origin. The term phytosterols refers to more than 200 different compounds. The most abundant ones in the human diet are sitosterol and campesterol. Their saturated counterparts, <b>sitostanol</b> and campestanol, are found in much lower amounts. Good food sources of phytosterols include vegetable oils, cereal grains, nuts, legumes, and fruits and vegetables. Phytosterols are structurally similar to cholesterol. Despite this structural similarity, they are not absorbed in significant quantities. Absorption is less than 2 % for phytosterols, while it is 30 - 60 % for cholesterol. Phytosterols {{are known to have}} various bioactive properties, which may have an impact on human health, and as such boosted interest in phytosterols in the past decade. The most important benefit is their blood cholesterol-lowering effect via partial inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption.

Plasma HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels were not affected. Consumption of phytosterol-enriched chocolates significantly increased plasma lathosterol concentration (+ 20. 7 %), reflecting an increased endogenous cholesterol synthesis in response to phytosterol-induced decreased intestinal cholesterol absorption. Furthermore, the chocolates enriched with phytosterols significantly increased both plasma sitosterol (+ 95. 8 %) and campesterol (+ 64. 1 %) levels, compared with the placebo chocolate group. However, the absolute values of plasma sitosterol and campesterol remained within the normal range, that is, below 10 mg/l. The chocolates with phytosterols were palatable and induced no clinical or biochemical side effects.

Methods In phase 1, 30 men received a single dose of 100, 200, 400, 800, 1, 600, or 2, 000 mg FM-VP 4 or placebo. In phase 2, 100 men were treated with 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg/day of FM-VP 4 or placebo for 4 weeks. Results The drug was well tolerated at each single or multiple dose level. After 4 weeks of treatment, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels changed by 2. 7 % {{in the placebo group}} and by 2. 9 %, - 4. 2 %, and - 4. 6 % in the 100, 200, and 800 mg/day groups, respectively, which was not statistically significant. However, 400 mg/day of FM-VP 4 significantly decreased LDL-C by 6. 5 % (p= 0. 02). Phase 1 showed that DACP and DASP were absorbed into plasma with a median t(max) of 12 h for both components, and clearance was slow with a mean t(1 / 2 lambda) of 57 h. During 4 weeks of treatment, steady state was reached by approximately 8 days. Conclusion This study demonstrated that up to 800 mg/day of FM-VP 4 is safe and well tolerated for at least 4 weeks. Furthermore, the higher doses significantly reduced LDL-C by 7 % compared with baseline or by 10 % compared with placebo, with the maximum effect reached at 400 mg/day...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this work was to {{study the effects of}} washing and purification steps on qualitative and quantitative analysis of fecal stanols in the oyster Crassostrea gigas using either single or a combination of lipid purification steps on silica gel or aminopropyl bonded silica gel (NH 2) or a washing step. Among the three analytical pathways compared, the two including water extraction or NH 2 purification did not lead to higher recoveries and decreased repeatabilities of extractions compared to the single purification on silica gel. This latter led to similar recoveries (ca. 80 %) and repeatabilities (ca. 10 %) for both spiked standards (coprostanol and <b>sitostanol).</b> This analytical pathway has been applied to oysters collected in a harvesting area in Brittany (France) where fecal contaminations are important and allowed to quantify eight stanols in oysters. The relative proportions of fecal stanols of these oysters were combined with principal component analysis in order to investigate the usefulness of their stanol fingerprints to record a fecal contamination and to distinguish its source between human, porcine and bovine contaminations. Oysters non-fecally contaminated by Escherichia coli did not present specific stanol fingerprints while oysters fecally contaminated had a bovine fingerprint, suggesting a contamination of these samples by bovine sources. As a consequence, the method developed here allows the use of stanol fingerprints of oysters as a microbial source tracking tool that can be applied to shellfish harvesting areas subjected to fecal contaminations in order to identify the different sources of contamination and improve watershed management...|$|E

The concentrations of Lactobacillus amylovorus, the Bacteroidales Pig- 2 -Bac 16 S rRNA genetic marker, five stanols and the evolution of two ratios of stanols, R 1 (coprostanol to the sum of coprostanol and 24 -ethylcoprostanol) and R 2 (<b>sitostanol</b> to coprostanol) were analyzed during two months along with the concentration of Faecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB). Pig manure was inoculated to unfiltered water microcosms incubated aerobically at 18 C in the dark. The faecal contamination load represented by the concentrations of culturable Escherichia coli and/or enterococci remained for two months in the freshwater and seawater microcosms water column. These concentrations followed a biphasic decay pattern with a 97 % reduction of the initial amount during a first rapid phase (< 6 days) and a remaining proportion undergoing a slower or null second decline. The L. amylovorus marker and five stanols persisted as long as the indicators in both treatments. The Pig- 2 -Bac marker persisted 20 and 27 days in seawater and freshwater, respectively. The ratios R 1 and R 2 were in the range specific to pig manure until day 6 in both types of water. These results indicate that Pig- 2 -Bac, L. amylovorus and stanol ratios might be used in combination to complement FIB testing to determine the pig source of fecal pollution.

Recently, a principal component analysis (PCA) method based on six stanol compounds (i. e. 5 bcholestan- 3 b-ol (coprostanol), 5 b-cholestan- 3 a-ol (epicoprostanol), 24 -methyl- 5 a-cholestan- 3 b-ol (campestanol), 24 -ethyl- 5 a-cholestan- 3 b-ol (<b>sitostanol),</b> 24 -ethyl- 5 b-cholestan- 3 b-ol (24 -ethylcoprostanol) and 24 -ethyl- 5 b-cholestan- 3 a-ol (24 -ethylepicoprostanol)) was shown to be suitable for distinguishing between porcine and bovine feces. In this study, we tested if this PCA method, using the above six stanols, {{could be used as a}} tool in "Microbial Source Tracking (MST) "methods in water fromareas of intensive agriculture where diffuse fecal contamination is often marked by the co-existence of human and animal sources. In particular, well-defined and stable clusters were found in PCA score plots clustering samples of "pure" human, bovine and porcine feces alongwith runoff and diluted waters in which the source of contamination is known. A good consistency was also observed between the source assignments made by the 6 -stanol-based PCA method and the microbial markers for river waters contaminated by fecal matter of unknown origin. More generally, the tests conducted in this study argue for the addition of the PCAmethod based on six stanols in the MST toolbox to help identify fecal contamination sources.

40|$|Both authors contributed {{equally to}} this review Abstract: Phytosterols (plant sterols and stanols) are {{naturally}} occurring compounds which {{are found in}} all foods of plant origin. The term phytosterols refers to more than 200 different compounds. The most abundant ones in the human diet are sitosterol and campesterol. Their saturated counterparts, <b>sitostanol</b> and campestanol, are found in much lower amounts. Good food sources of phytosterols include vegetable oils, cereal grains, nuts, legumes, and fruits and vegetables. Phytosterols are structurally similar to cholesterol. Despite this structural similarity, they are not absorbed in significant quantities. Absorption is less than 2 % for phytosterols, while it is 30 - 60 % for cholesterol. Phytosterols {{are known to have}} various bioactive properties, which may have an impact on human health, and as such boosted interest in phytosterols in the past decade. The most important benefit is their blood cholesterol-lowering effect via partial inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption. The recommended daily intake of 2 g of phytosterols reduces cholesterol absorption by 30 - 40 % and LDL-cholesterol by 10 % on average. Other claimed benefits of phytosterols are possible anti-atherogenic effects as well as, particularly for beta-sitosterol, immune stimulating and anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence suggesting that particularly plant sterols may have beneficial effects against the development of different types of cancers, like colorectal, breast and prostate cancers. It is not clear whether mechanisms other than the established cholesterol-lowering action of phytosterols as such also contribute to these potential health benefits...|$|E
40|$|Archaeological leather samples {{recovered}} from the ice field at the Schnidejoch Pass (altitude 2756 m amsl) in the western Swiss Alps were studied using optical, chemical molecular and isotopic (delta(13) C and delta(15) N of the bulk leather, and compound-specific delta(13) C analyses of the organic-solvent extracted fatty acids) methods to obtain insight into {{the origin of the}} leather and ancient tanning procedures. For comparison, leathers from modern native animals in alpine environment (red deer, goat, sheep, chamois, and calf/cow) were analyzed using the same approach. Optical and electron microscopically comparisons of Schnidejoch and modern leathers showed that the gross structure (pattern of collagen fibrils and intra-fibrils material) of archaeological leather had survived essentially intact for five millennia. The SEM studies of the hairs from the most important archaeological find, a Neolithic leather legging, show a wave structure of the hair cuticle, which is a diagnostic feature for goatskins. The variations of the bulk delta(13) C and delta(15) N values, and delta(13) C values of the main fatty acids are within the range expected for pre-industrial temperate C(3) environment. The archaeological leather samples contain a mixture of indigenous (from the animal) and exogenous plant/animal lipids. An important amount of waxy n-alkanes, n-alkan- 1 -ols and phytosterols (beta-sitosterol, <b>sitostanol)</b> in all samples, and abundant biomarker of conifers (nonacosan- 10 - 01) in the legging leathers clearly indicate that the Neolithic people were active in a subalpine coniferous forest, and that they used an aqueous extract of diverse plant material for tanning leather.

40|$|The {{unsaponifiable}} lipid {{fraction of}} plant-based foods {{is a potential}} source of bioactive components such as phytosterols, triterpenoids, carotenoids, tocopherols and various hydrocarbons. The free and esterified sterol concentrations in four Romanian edible oils (corn germ, wheat germ, sweet almond and grape seed oil) were determined, including individual values for β-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, Δ 5 -avenasterol, <b>sitostanol,</b> campestanol, and cholesterol. Free and esterified sterols were separated by solid-phase extraction (SPE), saponified, and analyzed as trimethylsilyl ether derivatives using gas-chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detector (FID). Differences in total sterol content {{and the proportion of}} esterified (ES) and free sterols (FS) were evident for studied oil samples. In general, β-sitosterol was the most prevalent phytosterol, ranging in concentration from 158. 3 mg/ 100 g in grape seed oil to 478. 5 mg/ 100 g in corn germ oil. Only in these two vegetable oil, we identified trace amount of cholesterol (< 3 mg/ 100 g). The total sterol concentrations ranged from 199. 9 mg/ 100 g (sweet almond oil) to 745. 2 mg/ 100 g (corn germ oil). In corn germ and wheat germ oil, the dominant form of sterols was the esterified one (60. 7 % ES and 55. 6 % ES, respectively, of total sterols). This study consolidates the view that vegetable oils are good natural sources of phytosterols. The analyses of these components provide rich information about the identity and quality of vegetable oils. The corn germ and wheat germ oils proved to be the richest sources in phytosterols, being recommended as functional oils. <br /...|$|E

A set of 10 artifacts, covering distinct osteological and typological features, was selected for study. The lipids were extracted separately from the surfaces of the tapered thinner working part and the wider handling area of each tool. The lipid distribution was characterized by a significant amount of animal sterols (cholesterol, cholestanol, coprostanol and epicholestanol), wax n-alkanes, n-alkan- 1 -ols and phytosterols (b-sitosterol, <b>sitostanol)</b> and abundant saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) in the C 14 –C 26 range.

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{compounds and}} lifestyle modifications as combination and mono-therapy are increasingly used for dyslipidemia. Specficially, phytosterols and fatty acids have demonstrated {{an ability to}} modulate cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism in different fashions. In two separate studies, the lipid-lowering effects of black raspberry seed oil and three different phytosterol stearates were examined in order to elucidate {{the effects of these}} dietary components and the factors influencing their therapeutic actions. The first study examined high cholesterol diets supplemented with crude and refined black raspberry seed oils, coconut oil or soybean oil. The crude and refined raspberry seed oil (RSO) treatments significantly altered lipid metabolism, lowering plasma and liver triglycerides while increasing cholesterol ester liver accumulation. Despite the typical reduction of phytosterol content in oils upon processing, both the composition and metabolic effects of the oils did not differ with the exception of increase bile acid excretion in the refined oil. The second study investigated three phytosterol stearates varying in their phytosterol composition: sitosterol, stigmasterol, or <b>sitostanol.</b> All diets were high in cholesterol and fat to induce dyslipidemia. The phytosterol stearate treatments did not significantly lower plasma cholesterol levels; however, free cholesterol concentrations in the liver were beneficially reduced by both the stanol stearate and sitosterol stearate dietary treatments. Fecal neutral sterol excretion was elevated in the stanol stearate and sitosterol stearate groups versus the cornstarch control, an effect absent in the stigmasterol stearate treatment, indicating that sitosterol stearate may be more effective than stigmasterol stearate at inducing neutral sterol loss via fecal excretion during this study at a 2. 5 % (g/g) dose. In summary, both studies demonstrated beneficial but conservative impacts upon cholesterol metabolism by the specified treatments, indicating that RSOs may be a beneficial therapy and that phytosterol stearates do not dramatically differ in their effects upon cholesterol metabolism at a 2. 5 % dose...|$|E
40|$|Although many {{putative}} sterol transporters influencing cholesterol absorption and physical-chemical {{factors affecting}} dietary cholesterol absorption have been extensively investigated, {{it is still}} unclear how biliary cholesterol contributes to the regulation of intestinal cholesterol absorption. We studied whether the gallbladder can modulate the microaggregates of cholesterol carriers, which may in turn influence the intestinal absorption of biliary cholesterol. Supersaturated, crystallized, or micellar model biles were delivered via a duodenal catheter to conscious, freely moving C 57 L mice daily for 2 days. Intestinal uptake and absorption of biliary cholesterol and its fecal excretion, as well as expression levels of intestinal sterol transporters, were analyzed. Cholesterol uptake and absorption by the enterocyte were dramatically reduced in mice treated with crystallized biles compared with supersaturated biles. This correlated with the higher cumulative radioactivity of cholesterol recovered in the feces at 24 hours. Such findings were absent with the added reference compound <b>sitostanol.</b> After removing cholesterol crystals from crystallized biles, micellar biles showed essentially identical effects on intestinal absorption but with lower fecal cholesterol excretion compared with the original samples containing crystals. Expression levels of the jejunal Abcg 5 (ATP-binding cassette transporter G 5) and Abcg 8, but not Npc 1 l 1 (Niemann-Pick C 1 like 1), were significantly increased by supersaturated biles compared with crystallized biles. Conclusion: Different physical forms of biliary cholesterol dramatically determine intestinal uptake and absorption of cholesterol. Solid plate-like cholesterol monohydrate crystals in bile are probably not absorbed and are totally excreted in feces from the body. The gallbladder may {{have a role in}} regulating cholesterol homeostasis by modulating the physical forms of biliary cholesterol.

40|$|Elevated {{levels of}} plasma {{cholesterol}} constitute a {{major risk factor}} for coronary heart disease (CHD). A dietary approach is the corner-stone for any lipid lowering regimen. However, non-traditional foods or nutraceuticals are emerging as dietary adjuncts to lower plasma cholesterol levels. ^ The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the cholesterol-lowering properties of corn fiber oil (CFO) in guinea pigs and to identify potential mechanisms involved in its hypocholesterolemic effect. Guinea pigs were chosen as the animal model because of their similarities to humans with respect to cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism. ^ Male Hartley guinea pigs were fed diets containing increasing doses of CFO: 0 (control), 5, 10 or 15 g/ 100 g diet. Total fat was adjusted to 15 g/ 100 g in all diets with regular corn oil. Diets contained 0. 25 g/ 100 g cholesterol. A positive control group (LC) with low dietary cholesterol (0. 04 g/ 100 g) was also included. In additional experiments, guinea pigs were fed increasing doses of <b>sitostanol</b> (SI) (0. 75, 1. 5 and 2. 25 g/ 100 g SI) to determine if SI is the active ingredient in CFO. Plasma total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower with increasing doses of CFO and SI. Guinea pigs fed CFO and SI had lower hepatic cholesterol compared to controls. ^ The total fecal neutral sterol excretion was enhanced in the CFO and SI groups compared to the control, indicating a decrease in cholesterol absorption with CFO/SI intake. Cholesterol 7 α hydroxylase, the regulatory enzyme of bile acid synthesis was also up-regulated by CFO. CFO treatment also lowered the hepatic microsomal cholesterol pool, which was paralleled by an induction of hepatic LDL receptor mRNA. ^ These results suggest that SI is the active ingredient in CFO. CFO/SI exert their hypocholesterolemic effect by reducing cholesterol absorption and increasing bile acid output, which results in lower concentrations of cholesterol in liver. This reduction in hepatic cholesterol alters hepatic cholesterol homeostasis and affects the circulating lipoproteins. In addition, {{the reduction in the}} microsomal free cholesterol pool upregulates the hepatic LDL receptors leading to the observed decrease in plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations with CFO/SI intake. ...|$|E
