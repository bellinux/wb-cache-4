This reduced entropy causes a force to act upon the large <b>spheres</b> pushing them together. This effect was convincingly demonstrated in experiments with vibrofluidized granular materials where attraction can be directly visualized.|$|R

50|$|The {{system of}} colloids and depletants in {{solution}} is typically modeled by treating the large colloids and small depletants as dissimilarly sized hard <b>spheres.</b> Hard <b>spheres</b> are characterized as non-interacting and impenetrable <b>spheres.</b> These two fundamental properties of hard <b>spheres</b> are described mathematically by the hard-sphere potential. The hard-sphere potential imposes steric constraint around large <b>spheres</b> {{which in turn}} gives rise to excluded volume, that is, volume that is unavailable for small <b>spheres</b> to occupy.|$|R

5|$|In modern thought, {{the orbits}} of the planets are viewed as the paths of those planets through mostly empty space. Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, {{considered}} the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of rarefied matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the <b>sphere</b> above it and the <b>sphere</b> below. When scholars applied Ptolemy's epicycles, they presumed that each planetary <b>sphere</b> was exactly thick enough to accommodate them. By combining this nested <b>sphere</b> model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at {{the time for the}} distances to the Sun (about 4 million miles), to the other planets, and {{to the edge of the}} universe (about 73 million miles). The nested <b>sphere</b> model's distances to the Sun and planets differ significantly from modern measurements of the distances, and the size of the universe is now known to be inconceivably large and possibly infinite.|$|E

The point (1, 0, 0, …, 0), which is on the equator of all the spheres, works well for geometric spheres; the (collapsed) rim of the disk is another obvious choice.|$|E

5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter <b>sphere</b> of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select <b>sphere</b> would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} <b>sphere,</b> its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required <b>sphere</b> diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E
50|$|Aristotle {{developed}} his own system of concentric <b>spheres</b> in Metaphysics and De Caelo (On the Heavens).

He added three <b>spheres</b> to Jupiter and Mars {{as well as}} four <b>spheres</b> to Venus, Mercury, the sun, and the moon {{for a total of}} fifty-five <b>spheres.</b> He later doubted the accuracy of his results and stated that he believed there were either forty seven or forty nine concentric <b>spheres.</b> Historians are unsure about how many <b>spheres</b> Aristotle thought there were in the cosmos with theories ranging from 43 to 55.

5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} from the plane to the <b>sphere</b> and other quadratic surfaces. For the <b>sphere,</b> the problem is to construct all the circles (the boundaries of spherical caps) that are tangent to three given circles on the <b>sphere.</b> This spherical {{problem can be}} rendered into a corresponding planar problem using stereographic projection. Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the stereographic projection. Even more generally, one can consider the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a problem first considered by Charles Dupin.|$|E

5|$|In Greek antiquity {{the ideas}} of {{celestial}} spheres and rings {{first appeared in the}} cosmology of Anaximander in the early 6th century BC. In his cosmology both the Sun and Moon are circular open vents in tubular rings of fire enclosed in tubes of condensed air; these rings constitute the rims of rotating chariot-like wheels pivoting on the Earth at their centre. The fixed stars are also open vents in such wheel rims, {{but there are so many}} such wheels for the stars that their contiguous rims all together form a continuous spherical shell encompassing the Earth. All these wheel rims had originally been formed out of an original <b>sphere</b> of fire wholly encompassing the Earth, which had disintegrated into many individual rings. Hence, in Anaximanders's cosmogony, in the beginning was the <b>sphere,</b> out of which celestial rings were formed, from some of which the stellar <b>sphere</b> was in turn composed. As viewed from the Earth, the ring of the Sun was highest, that of the Moon was lower, and the <b>sphere</b> of the stars was lowest.|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} the Forced Rayleigh Scattering {{technique}} to measure the self diffusion constant of the two separate species of charged polystyrene <b>spheres</b> mixed in a strongly interacting suspension. For a few large <b>spheres</b> diffusing in a larger density of smaller <b>spheres,</b> {{we find that the}} diffusion constant is simply related by Stokes law to the total viscosity of the suspension. For the same relative number of <b>spheres</b> the small <b>spheres</b> see each other as discrete particles and do not follow Stokes law with the total viscosity. In the opposite limit of a few small <b>spheres</b> in a sea of large <b>spheres,</b> we find that the self diffusion of the two species are equal.
