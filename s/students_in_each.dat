The Waterloo Regional Campus is located in downtown Kitchener, sharing facilities with the Health Sciences Campus of the University of Waterloo. The campus in St. Catharines is at Brock University's Niagara Health and Bioscience Research Complex. Approximately 30 medical <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> year of the program attend each campus. Those who apply to McMaster's School of Medicine are asked to rank their site choice (Hamilton, Niagara Region, Waterloo Region) from first to third, or no preference. Offers of admission to the medical school are made from a rank list irrespective of geographical preference. Subsequent to an applicant's acceptance, registrants to the class are placed based on their preference and geographical background. The offers given out by McMaster are bound to the assigned site.|$|E

25|$|Holy Cross {{offers a}} {{distinct}} honors program for high ability undergraduates. The Honors program {{is open to}} students in all majors. This highly selective program is limited to 36 <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> of the sophomore, junior, and senior classes from any major, and incorporates an honors colloquium and a thesis. An emphasis on independent research prepares students for their intensive thesis projects, the results of which are published within the College. Honors students also publicly present their findings at the annual academic conference, a highlight of the academic year. Additionally, some academic departments offer their own honors programs.|$|E
25|$|The {{undergraduate}} {{student body}} {{government is the}} UC San Diego Associated Students, organized as a cabinet and senate, while graduate students are represented by the Graduate Student Association, a proportional representative body with membership depending {{on the number of}} <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> graduate department. Additionally, graduate students who serve as teaching assistants are represented by the UC-wide union of Academic Student Employees. Each of the six residential colleges has its own student council as well. Most student media publications distributed on-campus are services provided and governed by ASUCSD, including Triton TV, a film studio and TV station, and the KSDT radio station. A notable exception is The Guardian, which is directly governed by the university's Student Affairs department.|$|E

25|$|An August 2009 study {{published}} in Megamot by Sorel Cahan of Hebrew University's School of Education demonstrated that the Israeli Education Ministry's budget for special assistance to students from low socioeconomic backgrounds severely discriminated against Arabs. It also showed that the average per-student allocation at Arab junior high schools was one-fifth the average at Jewish ones. This {{was the result of}} the allocation method used – assistance funds were first divided between Arab and Jewish school systems, according to the number of <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>each,</b> and then allocated to needy students; however, due to the largest proportion of such students in the Arab system, they received less funds, per student, than Jewish students. The Ministry of Education said that it had already decided to discontinue this allotment method in favor of a uniform index method, without first dividing the funds between the school systems.|$|E
25|$|Bejant is a {{term used}} to refer to first year male students; females being {{described}} as Bejantines. Second-year students are known as a Semis, a student in their third year may be referred to as a Tertian, and in their final year as a Magistrand. These terms are thought to be unique to St Andrews. When wearing their traditional red gowns, <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> year may be identified according to the way they wear their gowns. In the first year, the gown is worn on the shoulders, in the second year it is worn slightly off the shoulders. In the third year arts students wear their gowns off their left shoulders, and science students off their right shoulders. Finally, fourth years wear their gowns right down to their elbows, ready to shed their scarlet gowns for the black graduation gown. The gown is never to be joined at the top as this is considered bad luck.|$|E
25|$|In Argentina {{there are}} {{public and private}} medical schools, however the {{prestige}} of the public institutions is undeniable and the private institutions do not normally appear in international rankings. A person who can afford to attend a private university, quite expensive for the average Argentinian, will choose that option over public education because of the smaller groups of <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> class and {{because of the lack of}} strictness in course evaluation. By law entrance into public institutions is open and tuition-free to all who have a high school diploma, and universities are expressly forbidden from restricting access with difficult entrance exams. Point in case, in 2016 La Universidad Nacional de la Plata was obligated by the governing bodies to stop forcing its students to write an entrance exam. As a result, that university experienced a major increase in the size of its student population. When it comes to educational quality, la Universidad de Buenos Aires, a public university, is widely recognised as the top medical school in the country.|$|E

25|$|The {{most direct}} evidence, {{according}} to Kahneman, is a 1973 experiment that used a psychological profile of TomW., a fictional graduate student. One group of subjects had to rate Tom's similarity to a typical student {{in each of}} nine academic areas (Law, Engineering, Library Science etc.). Another group had to rate how {{likely it is that}} Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by probability, then they should resemble the base rates, i.e., the proportion of <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). A probabilistic judgment would say that Tom {{is more likely to be}} a Humanities student than Library Science, because many more students study Humanities, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.|$|E
500|$|The Liberal Arts Honors Program {{was created}} in 1957 and accepts {{approximately}} the top 125 <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> freshman class, offering three levels of academic scholarships {{for participation in the}} program.

500|$|The {{original}} University charter {{adopted by}} the New York State legislature required that Cornell give scholarships from <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> legislative district to attend the University tuition-free.

This allowed students of diverse financial resources to attend the university from the start.|$|E
