In this paper we assert that Shimer’s analysis is problematic, for two reasons: (1) cyclicality is not evaluated systematically; and (2) the measured contributions to unemployment variability do not actually decompose total unemployment variability. We address these problems by applying a standard statistical measure of business cycle comovement, and con-structing a precise decomposition of unemployment variability.

50|$|Electrodynamic droplet {{deformation}} also {{of particular}} interest in crude oil processing as a method to improve the <b>separation</b> <b>rate</b> of water and salts from the bulk. In its unprocessed form, crude oil cannot be used directly in industrial processes because the presence of salts can corrode heat exchangers and distillation equipment. To avoid fouling due to these impurities {{it is necessary to}} first remove the salt, which is concentrated in suspended water droplets. Exposing batches of crude oil to both DC and AC high-voltage electric fields induces droplet deformation that ultimately causes the water droplets to coalesce into larger droplets. Droplet coalescence improves the <b>separation</b> <b>rate</b> of water from crude oil because the upward velocity of a sphere is proportional to the square of the sphere’s radius. This can be easily shown by considering gravitational force, buoyancy, and Stokes flow drag. It has been reported that increasing both the amplitude and frequency of the applied electric fields can significantly increases water separation up to 90%.|$|E
