She said in 2011 that she chose {{emancipation}} as she was influenced by other young actors doing it. In 1997, unhappy with the roles they were being offered, Williams and several actor friends wrote a script entitled Blink. It was sold, but nothing happened with it.|$|E
5|$|Daenerys Targaryen {{arrives with}} Khal Moro's khalasar at Vaes Dothrak, and is escorted {{to meet with}} the Dosh Khaleen by Moro's bloodriders. The elder of the Dosh Khaleen tries to sympathize with Daenerys, saying she was once married to a great khal with whom <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would rule the world but met the same fate. After giving Daenerys a change of clothes, she {{explains}} that the various khalasar have gathered at Vaes Dothrak to discuss which cities and towns to conquer. They have also met to discuss what to do with Daenerys, noting that she hopes for her safety should they decide to let her remain with the Dosh Khaleen.|$|E
5|$|The King {{sought a}} divorce, but his advisors {{suggested}} that any divorce proceedings might involve {{the publication of}} details relating to the King's own adulterous relationships. Therefore, he requested and ensured {{the introduction of the}} Pains and Penalties Bill, under which Parliament could have imposed legal penalties without a trial in a court of law. The bill would have annulled the marriage and stripped Caroline of the title of Queen. The bill proved extremely unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George IV decided, nonetheless, to exclude his wife from his coronation at Westminster Abbey, on 19 July 1821. Caroline fell ill that day and died on 7 August; during her final illness she often stated that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had been poisoned.|$|E

5|$|The Queen had {{to mediate}} between her {{brothers}} in 1555, when Charles decided to abdicate as emperor {{and leave the}} government of the Netherlands to his son Philip, despite Ferdinand's objections. When Mary learned of Charles's decision, she informed him that she too would resign. Both Charles and Philip urged her to remain in the post, but she refused. She chronicled the difficulties she had faced due to her gender, the fact that she could not act as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> should have because of disagreements with Charles, and her age. Furthermore, she did not wish to accommodate to the ways of her nephew after years of getting used to Charles's demands. The actual reason for Mary's resignation was her numerous disagreements with her nephew. She asked for Charles's permission to leave the Netherlands upon her resignation, fearing that she would be drawn into politics again if she remained.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
25|$|September through October is the malaria season, {{which may}} complicate efforts to treat Ebola. For example, one Freetown doctor did not {{immediately}} quarantine herself because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had malaria not Ebola. The doctor was eventually diagnosed with Ebola and died in September 2014.|$|E

25|$|Sabatini {{said that}} she {{deliberately}} lost matches in her youth to avoid reporters and the limelight. She made this claim when she was 43, saying her shyness was a major problem, and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had to speak after winning a tournament; so, she often lost in semifinals.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{during her}} time at Cranbrook Kingswood, Blair was {{involved}} in a production of T.S. Eliot’s Murder in the Cathedral. According to Blair, it was a failure, but her English teacher told her not to give up; {{that was the first time}} <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> could be an actress.|$|E
25|$|Before writing novels, Waters {{worked as}} an academic, earning a {{doctorate}} and teaching. Waters went directly from her doctoral thesis to her first novel. It was {{during the process of}} writing her thesis that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would write a novel; she began as soon as the thesis was complete. Her work is very research-intensive, which is an aspect she enjoys. Waters was briefly a member of the long-running London North Writers circle, whose members have included the novelists Charles Palliser and Neil Blackmore, among others.|$|E
60|$|Yes, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> if <b>she</b> were dying, {{he would}} relent. <b>She</b> <b>thought,</b> that if <b>she</b> lay, serene and not unwilling to depart, upon the bed that was curtained round with {{recollections}} of their darling boy, {{he would be}} touched home, and would say, 'Dear Florence, live for me, and we will love each other as we might have done, and be as happy as {{we might have been}} these many years!' <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> that if <b>she</b> heard such words from him, and had her arms clasped round him' she could answer with a smile, 'It is too late for anything but this; I never could be happier, dear father!' and so leave him, with a blessing on her lips.|$|R

25|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{had been}} {{contaminated}} at the plant. Kerr-McGee's management said that Silkwood had contaminated herself {{in order to}} portray the company in a negative light. According to Richard L. Rashke's book, The Killing of Karen Silkwood (1981/2000), security at the plant was so lax that workers could easily smuggle out finished plutonium pellets. Rashke wrote that the soluble type of plutonium found in Silkwood's body came from a production area which she had not accessed for four months. The pellets had since been stored in the vault of the facility.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years later}} on July 12, 1955, shortly before her 11th birthday, Muir was {{admitted}} into the institution {{solely on the}} basis of information provided by her mother, without any diagnostic testing. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had been sent to an orphanage. Under superintendent Leonard Jan Le Vann, a precondition for admission into the Provincial Training School was a signature from Muir's mother permitting the legal enforcement of compulsory sterilization. Over the years, Muir was educated to a grade 5 level and saw her mother only intermittently until her departure from the institution at the age of 20.|$|E
25|$|Edith Shain {{wrote to}} Eisenstaedt {{in the late}} 1970s {{claiming}} to be {{the woman in the}} picture. In August 1945, Shain was working at Doctor's Hospital in Manhattan, New York City as a nurse when she and a friend heard on the radio that World War II had ended. They went to Times Square where all the celebrating was and as soon as she arrived on the street from the subway, the sailor grabbed her in an embrace and kissed her. She related that at the time <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> might as well let him kiss her since he fought for her in the war. Shain did not claim that she was the woman in the white dress until many years later when she wrote to Eisenstaedt. He notified the magazine that he had received her letter claiming to be the subject.|$|E

25|$|In {{a signed}} affidavit, Siddiqui's {{maternal}} uncle, Shams ul-Hassan Faruqi, stated that on 22 January 2008 she {{visited him in}} Islamabad and told him she had been held by Pakistani agencies. Knowing he had worked in Afghanistan and made contact with the Taliban in 1999, she asked for his help to cross into Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would be safe. He {{told her he was}} no longer in touch with them. He notified his sister, Siddiqui's mother, who came the next day to see her daughter. He said that Siddiqui stayed with them for two days. Investigating the disappearance, a US journalist (Deborah Scroggins) reported that Geo TV presenter Hamid Mir informed her that friends of Siddiqui believed she had gone underground avoiding the FBI. Scroggins was also warned by Pakistanis with jihadist connections (including Khalid Khawaja) that she (Scroggins) might end up like Daniel Pearl (beheaded) if she attempted to pursue finding Siddiqui.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{remained}} in the Seanad for four more years, although at this point {{many of the issues}} she had campaigned for had been tackled. Contraception had been legalised although heavily restricted, women were on juries, and the marriage bar on women in the civil service had been revoked. To the surprise of many, she decided not to seek re-election to the senate in 1989. One year later, however, Labour approached her about running for president in that year's election. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was being asked her legal advice about the type of policy programme party leader Dick Spring was proposing. However, as she read the briefing notes, she began to realise that the programme was aimed at her. After some consideration, she agreed to become the first Labour nominee for the presidency and the first woman candidate in what was only the second presidential election to be contested by three candidates since 1945.|$|E
25|$|Hurd-Wood {{attended}} Rodborough Technology College in Milford, Surrey from 2001 to 2006 for her GCSEs with Art, English Literature, Psychology and Philosophy as subjects. She had tutored lessons {{during the}} filming of Peter Pan in Australia during 2002 to 2003 as her work lasted for a span of 8 to 9 months. She later attended sixth-form Godalming College from 2006 to 2008 to study for her GCE Advanced Levels with Art, Psychology and Philosophy as subjects. Hurd-Wood had considered becoming a marine biologist because of her love for dolphins. She gave up on the idea when she discovered that it would require studying science because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was {{not very good at}} it. She became interested in working with children who have special needs or disabilities. Hurd-Wood studied linguistics from 2008 at University College London, having completed her first year in 2009, but left the course incomplete before travelling to Australia for the filming of Tomorrow, When the War Began, when she decided to focus entirely on her career in acting.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do love him," [...] said Linda. Using {{the moment}} for {{reflection}} allowed to her as best <b>she</b> could, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> saw the best means of escape in this avowal. Surely her aunt would not press her to marry one man when she had declared that she loved another.|$|R

So the excursion was decided upon, and the party set off the next day.|$|R
25|$|Stewart {{continued}} her stellar play in her sophomore year; her coaches {{noticed that she}} was demanding the ball more often, something she occasionally did as a freshman, but usually only if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was playing well. By {{the end of her}} sophomore year, she was named the American Athletic Conference Player of the Year in the league's first season after the split of the original Big East Conference, an honor she would go on to win the following two seasons. Additionally, she was named AP Player of the Year, only the third time in history a sophomore had claimed the honor. The other two sophomore recipients were UConn's Maya Moore and Oklahoma's Courtney Paris. Stewart started and played in all 40 games of 2013–2014 season. She led the team at 19.4 points and 2.8 blocks per game, was second on the team with 8.1 rebounds per contest, and fourth on the squad at 49.7 percent shooting and her 291 field goals made was the third-highest single-season total in UConn annals. Her 324 boards marked the 12th-highest single-season total in school history, and her 110 rejections was the third-highest mark.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after moving}} to Athens, Tryfonos {{attended}} the Athens auditions for the first season of Greek Idol. There she received all yes votes from the judges along with praise, while judge Kostas Kapetanidis predicted {{that she would be}} in the top ten. Tryfonos initially did not want to audition for the show, but did so after encouragement from family and friends, as well as after having viewed a television commercial for the show; producers called her back the next day. She had not told anyone she was auditioning besides her brother and best friend, and instead told her parents about it shortly before the first episode was set to air. Tryfonos had also previously auditioned for the second season of rival Greek talent competition The X Factor, and passed the audition phase before ultimately being cut before the live shows. In response, she later stated that {{she did not want to}} join any reality show as she did not want to be judged on anything other than her voice, but auditioned for Greek Idol as she believed it was more of a simple talent show. Throughout the competition, she was considered a favourite to win. Recalling her experience on the show later on, she stated that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would make it as a finalist onto the live shows with some difficulty, but never expected to win the completion. Following recall rounds and ten live shows, Trifonos came first in the competition and won a recording contract with Sony Music Entertainment Greece.|$|E
25|$|Sir Roger’s sister-in-law, Mrs. Ackroyd, her daughter, Flora, his secretary, Geoffrey Raymond and Major Blunt, a guest, are {{relaxing}} in the hall. Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora live there {{due to their}} financial circumstances. They are utterly reliant on Sir Roger who tightly controls their money and consequently they are in some debt. They discuss {{a report in the}} newspaper of the suicide of a local woman, Mrs. Ashley Ferrars, during the previous night. She had a close relationship with Sir Roger and her death has greatly affected him. They further discuss the impending announcement of the engagement between Flora and Sir Roger’s stepson, Ralph Paton and the difference that this marriage will make. A young woman who is a neighbour, Caryl Sheppard, arrives to play bridge and Flora teases her over her fascination for a recent arrival in the village – a foreigner who Caryl thinks is called M. Porrott, but Flora reveals that her uncle has told her that he in fact is M. Hercule Poirot, the famous French detective. Poirot arrives and meets everyone. He is especially taken with Caryl. During the conversation, Caryl tells Flora that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> saw Ralph Paton in the village that morning but Flora is surprised – as far as she knew Ralph has been in London for the previous six months ever since he had an argument with his uncle. As Caryl's brother, Dr. James Sheppard, is dining at Fernley that evening, she will be alone and she invites Poirot to dine with her. They leave together. As the others go off to change for dinner, a maid, Ursula Bourne, tidies the room and meets Ralph when he comes in from the terrace. It is obvious that the two have a secret relationship but their conversation is interrupted as Bourne sees Dr. Sheppard approaching the house. Ralph quickly hides in the adjoining library and Dr. Sheppard enters to be greeted by Parker, the butler. Dr. Sheppard may have to rush out to a confinement case later and consequently he has his doctor's bag with him which Parker looks after. Sheppard is left to his own devices for a moment and Ralph comes out of hiding and tells the doctor, an old friend, that he is in a mess with his stepfather and that he is staying at a local inn, the White Horse. Ralph leaves the house and soon Sir Roger himself comes down into the hall. He too unburdens himself on Sheppard: Mrs. Ferrars was going to be his fiancée after the year’s mourning for the late Mr. Ferrars came to an end but, when the requisite time was up, she hesitated for three more months and then confessed that she poisoned her brutal husband. She was driven to suicide by an unknown blackmailer who knew of her actions and has been draining her of funds all this time. Sir Roger is certain that she would have left him a letter detailing who her persecutor was. At that moment, Parker comes in with a letter for Sir Roger – it is from the late Mrs. Ferrars but he has no time to open it as the others come down for dinner.|$|E
