60|$|It {{is useless}} {{to go into}} the reasons for this act of Victoria's. She did not know them herself. The nearer Victoria got to Mr. Jenney's, the more she wished herself back at the forks. Suppose Mrs. Fitch told him of her visit! Perhaps she could pass the Jenneys' unnoticed. The chances of this, indeed, seemed highly favourable, and it was {{characteristic}} of her sex that she began to pray fervently to this end. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> hill road, feeling as though she had but to look back to see the smoke of the burning bridges.|$|E

Gunno brings the ransom deadline forward and Heath and Kyle decide to return home, while Ash stays behind.|$|R
60|$|And yet she did {{not want}} to go to the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras either. The church clock above her clanged eleven. She ought to take the twelve-forty train to Mansfield. Yet instead of going home <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> down <b>the</b> alley towards the fields and the brook.|$|R
5000|$|At the end, Deb is {{seen on a}} {{computer}} conversing in a chatroom. She is asked what she looks like. She types [...] "the truth or a lie?" [...] to which she is asked to lie. Now, wearing glasses again, <b>she</b> just <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> computer.|$|R

60|$|Not {{wanting to}} go through the yard, because of <b>the</b> dogs, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> along <b>the</b> hill-side to descend on the pond from above. The moon was transcendent over the bare, open space, she {{suffered}} from being exposed to it. There was a glimmer of nightly rabbits across the ground. The night was as clear as crystal, and very still. She could hear a distant coughing of a sheep.|$|R

She follows him to apologize, kisses him and directly invites him to sleep with her, the sexual element of which he fails to comprehend at first. After they flirt in a movie theater the following day, he gives in but backs down when she reacts without fondness to the notion of marrying him. One day later, she tells him she guesses they can at least date for a while. After they flirt during their first date in a restaurant, they return home and have sex.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{only made}} her a grave inclination, for, though he could not blame her for it, his father's death was the most {{formidable}} of the barriers between them, and, recognizing it, he felt a little thrill of dismay as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> across <b>the</b> lawn toward where Mrs. Burnell was apparently awaiting her. It afterward cost him an effort to talk intelligently to Austerly and his daughter; but since they betrayed no astonishment at his observations, he fancied that he had somehow accomplished it.|$|R
60|$|Ursula {{set off to}} Willey Green, {{towards the}} mill. She came to Willey Water. It was almost full again, after its period of emptiness. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> through <b>the</b> woods. The night had fallen, it was dark. But she forgot to be afraid, she who had such great sources of fear. Among the trees, far from any human beings, there {{was a sort of}} magic peace. The more one could find a pure loneliness, with no taint of people, the better one felt. She was in reality terrified, horrified in her {{apprehension}} of people.|$|R

60|$|But {{of course}} {{all this was}} silly. The marriage, the love, the affairs of Captain Anthony were none of my business.

It was the white straw hat of a good form and trimmed with a bunch of pale roses which had caught my eye. The whole figure seemed familiar. Of course! Flora de Barral. She was making for the hotel, she was going in. And Fyne was with Captain Anthony! To meet him could not be pleasant for her. I wished to save her from the awkwardness, and as I hesitated what to do she looked up and our eyes happened to meet just as <b>she</b> was <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pavement into the hotel doorway. Instinctively I extended my arm. It was enough to make her stop. I suppose she had some faint notion that she had seen me before somewhere.

5000|$|The {{programme}} proved controversial, with controversy {{beginning to}} generate {{one week before}} broadcast, when the current value of tickets was questioned. When a competition winner refused two tickets to the show as her prize {{at the end of}} the 21 November edition of The Late Late Show, visibly infuriated presenter Pat Kenny tore them up live on air. Kenny questioned why she had entered the competition if she had not wanted to attend the Toy Show (the tickets were just part of the prize; also on offer was ‚Ç¨10,000). In the aftermath, the winner, identified as Barbara Heavey from Cork, explained to a newspaper that she had entered the competition [...] "out of boredom", had [...] "no interest in watching children play with toys for two hours" [...] and had no children of her own. She did not see the actual tearing of the tickets as <b>she</b> had <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> television [...] "to prevent an echo on the line" [...] and attempted to suggest that they either be raffled or donated to someone else only to be drowned out by Kenny and his audience's vocal disbelief. Despite numerous attempts by RT√â to have her attend, she said she would be [...] "bored stiff", wasn't interested in toys and, if she had to attend the show, would probably [...] "set <b>off</b> <b>the</b> smoke alarms by chain-smoking in the toilets". Kenny did not let the matter rest however, opening his morning radio show the following Monday with a five-minute chat to his listeners in which he implied that the torn-up tickets were of more value than All Ireland final and Munster v. All Blacks tickets. Within minutes footage was uploaded onto the video hosting website YouTube, with spoofs of the incident also created. and Heavey was congratulated in numerous national newspapers.|$|R
