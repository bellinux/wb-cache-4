25|$|The first {{indication}} of delays came in March 2007, {{when the national}} government started trading accusations with authorities of the Zagreb County. The government accused the county authorities of willfully slowing down the project as the county failed to adopt required amendments of their spatial planning documents. In turn, the county accused the government of insufficient project funding and that accusations levied by the central government were intended to disguise lack of money. This situation led to announcements made in 2008, that the motorway would be built {{from the direction of}} Sisak, however that was not immediately feasible as land was not purchased and construction design had to be adjusted. Even so, the works were announced to start north of Sisak at the beginning of 2009. The plan to start construction in 2009 from Sisak were confirmed in July 2008, when Hrvatske autoceste denied rumors that the route may be shortened to the northern outskirts of Sisak, instead of Mošćenica suburb of Petrinja located immediately to the south of Sisak. By August 2008, the planning of a tunnel under Zagreb <b>shunting</b> <b>yard</b> was abandoned in favor of a viaduct extending {{to the north of the}} planned Jakuševec interchange. Construction of the latter started shortly afterwards, but stalled.|$|E

40|$|Relationships between {{exposure}} to noise [metric: day-evening-night levels (DENL) ] from stationary sources (<b>shunting</b> <b>yards,</b> a seasonal industry, and other industries) and annoyance are presented. Curves are presented for expected annoyance score, the percentage "highly annoyed" (%HA, cutoff at 72 {{on a scale from}} 0 to 100), the percentage "annoyed" (%A, cutoff at 50 on a scale from 0 to 100), and the percentage "(at least) a little annoyed" (%LA, cutoff at 28 on a scale from 0 to 100). The estimates of the parameters of the relations are based on the data from a field study (N= 1875) at 11 locations (2 <b>shunting</b> <b>yards,</b> 1 seasonal industry, 8 other industries) in the Netherlands. With the same (yearly) DENL, the seasonal industry causes less annoyance than the other industries, while the other industries cause less annoyance than the <b>shunting</b> <b>yards.</b> It appears that annoyance caused by vibrations from <b>shunting</b> <b>yards</b> and annoyance caused by noise from through trains are (partly) responsible for the relatively high annoyance from <b>shunting</b> <b>yards.</b> The relatively low annoyance from the seasonal industry presumably is related to the presence of a relatively quiet period. Results for the two <b>shunting</b> <b>yards</b> and the seasonal industry are based on fewer data than the other industrial sources, and are indicative. The same patterns of influence of age and noise sensitivity that are generally found are also found in this study. For comparison, results regarding transportation sources are also given, including previously unpublished results for expected annoyance. © 2004 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R

2500|$|The ZagrebSisak {{motorway}} {{was defined}} as a priority traffic route by the Government of Croatia in Motorway development plan for the 20052008 period. The route defined at the time fully complied with county development plans, except in a [...] segment south of the Zagreb bypass, which required changes of the spatial planning documents of the City of Zagreb and the [...] Zagreb County. Hrvatske autoceste developed a preliminary study of the route, proposing to connect the A11 to Zagreb at the Zagreb bypass and the Sarajevska Road, requiring a tunnel below Zagreb railway <b>shunting</b> <b>yard.</b> The plan also required moving the A3 motorway Buzin interchange approximately [...] to the west. The plans refer to the moved interchange as Sveta Klara interchange. That scheme planned completion of the motorway to the south of Velika Gorica by 2007, to Lekenik by 2008 and later on to Sisak. At the time the cost of the first section between Velika Gorica and Buševec was estimated at 328 million kuna (44.3 million euro), and the extension to Lekenik was valued at 586 million kuna (79.1 million euro). In February and March 2006, Government of Croatia performed tender procedure for the [...] northernmost section of the A11 spanning the Jakuševec interchange and the Velika Gorica jug exit. At the time, the cost of the section was estimated at 770 million kuna (104 million euro) and the construction works were scheduled to be completed by June 15, 2007. On April 4, commencement of the works between the Velika Gorica jug interchange and Hrašće Turopoljsko was announced. The contract was won by a joint venture comprising Viadukt, Hidroelektra, Konstruktor and Strabag, at a price of 202 million kuna (27.3 million euro) without VAT, and the works were scheduled to be completed by June 15, 2007.|$|E

60|$|On {{returning}} to their horses they had a long talk. Chris was deeply disappointed, but the others, who had never quite believed that his scheme could be carried out, were greatly delighted at the knowledge that at any rate {{they might be able}} to do an immense deal of damage to the enemy. As soon as it became quite dark, they set out again; they did not take their rifles with them, but each had his brace of revolvers. They had no intention of fighting, except to secure a retreat. Before starting, each had wound strips of flannel round his boots, so that they could run noiselessly. Brown had in the first place suggested that they should take their boots off, but Chris pointed out that if they had to run in the dark, one or other of them was sure to lame himself by striking against a stone or other obstacle. There were several large fires in the <b>shunting</b> <b>yard,</b> and at each end of the bridge, and at the Boer barracks. Crawling along on their hands and knees they were completely in the shade, and managed to get within some twenty or thirty yards of the Boers, who were sitting smoking and talking. They were all evidently greatly satisfied with news that they had heard during the day. Listening to their talk, they gathered something of what had happened since they left Estcourt. Colenso had been evacuated by us, an armoured train coming up from Estcourt had been drawn off the line, and most of the soldiers with it had been killed or captured. The last news was that the British had sallied out from Estcourt, which was now surrounded, and had attacked the Boers posted in a very strong position near a place called Willow Grange, but had been repulsed, principally by the artillery, with, it was said, immense loss. This was not pleasant hearing for the listeners. The Boers then had a grumble at being kept so far away from the fighting. It was not that they were so anxious to be engaged, as to get a share of the loot, as it had been reported that something like twenty thousand cattle and horses had been driven off from Natal.|$|E
