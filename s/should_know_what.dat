5|$|Noam Chomsky, a {{linguist}} {{and political}} scientist, surprised many by {{coming to the}} defense of sociobiology on the grounds that political radicals needed to postulate a relatively fixed idea of human nature {{in order to be able}} to struggle for a better society, claiming that leaders <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> human needs were in order to build a better society.|$|E
25|$|The concept {{goes back}} {{at least as far}} as Aristotle who, in Poetics, {{referred}} to narration and action as different modes or manner of representing something. For many years, fiction writing was described has having two types: narration and dialogue. Evan Marshall, in The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing (1998) noted that writers <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they are doing at all times. He described what he called fiction-writing modes—the types of writing of which all fiction is made. He listed five modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background, each with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and where it should be used.|$|E
25|$|Metzinger {{once did}} {{gorgeous}} mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that {{an effect of}} vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color. Surely, Metzinger <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> such things mean. Picasso never painted a pretty woman, though we have noticed that he likes to associate with them. Czobel sees them through the bars of his cage, and roars out tones of mauve and cinnabar. Derain sees them as cones and prisms, and Braque {{as if they had}} been sawn out of blocks of wood by carpenters’ apprentices. But Metzinger is more tender towards the sex. He arranges them as flowers are arranged on tapestry and wall paper; he simplifies them to mere patterns, and he carries them gently past the frontier of Poster Land to the world of the Ugly so tenderly that they are not much damaged—only more faint, more vegetable, more anaemic.|$|E

500|$|Suzuki {{did not use}} storyboards and disliked pre-planning. He {{preferred}} {{to come up with}} ideas either the night before or on the set as he felt that the only person who <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> is going to happen is the director. He also felt that it was sudden inspiration that made the picture. An example is the addition of the Number Three Killer's rice-sniffing habit. Suzuki explained that he wanted to present a quintessentially [...] "Japanese" [...] killer, [...] "If he were Italian, he'd get turned on by macaroni, right?" [...] Suzuki has commended Shishido on his similar drive to make the action scenes as physical and interesting as possible. In directing his actors, Suzuki let them play their roles as they saw fit and only intervened when they went [...] "off track". For nude scenes the actors wore maebari, or adhesive strips, over their genitals in accordance with censorship practices. The film was edited in one day, a task made easy by Suzuki's method of shooting only the necessary footage. He had picked up the habit during his years working as an assistant director for Shochiku when film stock remained sparse after the war. Post-production was completed on June 14, 1967, the day before the film was released.|$|E

Although he {{admitted}} to murdering 21 people, mostly prostitutes and wealthy old men, the Seoul Central District Court convicted him of 20 murders (one case was dismissed on a technicality). Yoo burned three and mutilated at least 11 of his victims, admitting he ate the livers of some of them. He committed his crimes between September 2003 and July 2004, when he was arrested.

2500|$|In August 1946, Cowles {{was hired}} as the head {{basketball}} coach at the University of Michigan, succeeding Bennie Oosterbaan. [...] Upon hiring Cowles, Michigan's athletic director Fritz Crisler said, [...] "In recommending Mr. Cowles, I feel that we are very fortunate. [...] He is absolutely in my estimation the best possible man for the position we could select." [...] In {{his first year at}} Michigan, he led the team to a 12–8 record. [...] The following year, he led the 1947–48 Michigan Wolverines to a 16–6 (.727) record. [...] The team won the 1948 Big Ten Conference championship. [...] In February 1948, as Cowles led the Wolverines to a turnaround season, the press focused on Cowles' success in Ann Arbor. [...] The Toledo Blade sports editor wrote:"Win, lose or draw in the red hot scramble for the Western Conference basketball title, the University of Michigan team has done so surprisingly well this season that Coach Ozzie Cowles is getting as much applause on the Ann Arbor campus as came to Fritz Crisler after the football season. [...] Michigan for years has prided itself on its well rounded athletic program. ... But until Cowles was lured away from Dartmouth to take charge of the Wolverine cagers, basketball wasn't going too well at Michigan. ... Those who <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they are talking about say that Michigan is winning this year, not because of any great supply of sterling cage performers, but because of the personality and coaching finesse of Cowles." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Arthur wins a large cash prize in a {{sweepstakes}} and uses it to take the whole family on a holiday to Egypt. After they return, Arthur thinks that Harry <b>should</b> <b>know</b> (<b>what</b> he [...] then believes to be) the truth about Sirius Black. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, it seems that Arthur does not fully believe the stories of Harry's abuse {{at the hands of}} the Dursleys until he witnesses what they think about Harry and the Wizarding world and is stunned to see them so eager to say goodbye to him, before taking him to the Quidditch World Cup. At the beginning of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Mr Weasley is a member of the Order, and accompanies Harry to his visit in the Ministry. During one of his shifts in the Ministry guarding Sybill Trelawney's prophecy, Voldemort's pet snake Nagini attacks him. Harry, who is mentally connected with Voldemort, manages to see this in a vision and is able to warn the Hogwarts authorities. Arthur is subsequently saved just in time and sent to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, where he fully recovers. Rowling has revealed that in the original draft for Order of the Phoenix she planned to kill Arthur. She changed her mind, however, saying that she could not kill Arthur as he is one of the few good fathers in the series. However, as she [...] "wanted to kill parents", she spared Arthur's life in exchange for Lupin's and Tonks's. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Arthur has been promoted to Head of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects.|$|E
