This plan also stated that they should promote race equality within the procurement process by increasing their use of BME contractors and consultants and by ensuring that the contractors and consultants they engaged were operating within a race equality framework. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the factors affecting race equality and procurement in the social housing sector in Wales. This involved collecting data from <b>social</b> <b>landlords,</b> main contractors and consultants and BME contractors and consultants. This research discusses the data collected from 39 <b>social</b> <b>landlords</b> in Wales (12 of the 22 local authorities and 27 of the 30 major housing associations).

The paper adds to existing evidence that the nature of electronic service delivery is heavily influenced by the agencies that introduce it and by the context in which it occurs. The shape of electronic service delivery in social housing was found to be heavily influenced by the high complexity of transactions between <b>social</b> <b>landlords</b> and tenants, and by the ethos of some <b>social</b> <b>landlords.</b> The research also suggested there was a broad consensus between <b>social</b> <b>landlords</b> and tenants with regard to the practical limits of online services.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Scottish Continuous Recording System (SCORE) records lettings data from all participating Registered <b>Social</b> <b>Landlords</b> (RSLs) in Scotland. Information about these tenancies has been collected since 1989. SCORE is funded and managed by the Scottish Government. It provides {{a wide variety of}} data from participating Scottish Registered <b>Social</b> <b>Landlords</b> (RSLs) on new tenancies that are created. This includes household profile, reasons for moving, financial situation, homelessness status and previous accommodation. SCORE data collection is continuous as information is received from Registered <b>Social</b> <b>Landlords.</b> More specifically, data is collected at the time of letting and then uploaded using the SCORE online system. It is not mandatory for RSLs to provide their lettings data to SCORE. Equivalent information on Local Authority social housing lettings is not currently collected via SCORE, although this is planned within the next few years. SCORE data was first collected in 1989 and covers an annual 1 st April to the 31 st March period. Data is available in annual chunks from the 1 st April to the 31 st March and made available in July of each year. At the moment, the SCORE records available to researchers start from the 1 st April 1992. As at December 2009, the dataset covered 85 % of lettings made by <b>social</b> <b>landlords.</b> Some letting types are excluded such as successions, assignments and households in temporary accommodation. SCORE only records those social housing lettings made by registered <b>social</b> <b>landlords</b> and not local authorities at present. Summary information on SCORE data is produced throughout the year and published on the SCORE website. There is also an online reporting system and a facility to download the raw SCORE data, but this is restricted to participating Registered <b>Social</b> <b>Landlords.</b> Access to the raw SCORE data is available to researchers, subject to application approval from the Scottish Government. Research Usage and Linkage The SCORE dataset has been used by a number of different organisations including The Scottish Government, The Scottish Federation for Housing Associations, Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland, universities and registered <b>social</b> <b>landlords</b> {{for a wide variety of}} purposes. This has included rent reviews, affordability monitoring, homelessness cases, the route to social housing of tenants and for general housing strategy purposes. Furthermore, it is planned that summary SCORE data will be included in the SNS (Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics). The SCORE dataset could potentially be used in conjunction to CORE, Supporting People in England, or NICORE in Northern Ireland datasets for social housing research. Furthermore, due to the fact that the SCORE data are collected at a unit level, it would be theoretically possible to link the data to other datasets. </div...|$|R
