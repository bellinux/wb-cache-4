Pr 3 + non-Kramers emerges at 100 K and Zeeman splits. An observed absence of <b>spin</b> <b>wave</b> <b>resonances</b> in PrCrO 3 is attributed to Pr 3 + remaining paramagnetic. In SmCrO 3 near cancelation of the spin and orbital moments is proposed as the possible reason for not detecting Sm 3 + ground state transitions.

In ErCrO 3 the Er 3 + Kramers doublet becomes active at about the TSR onset. Each line further experiences Zeeman splitting under magnetic fields while an spin reversal induced by a 2. 5 T field, back to the Gamma 4 (Fz) from the Gamma 1 phase at 2 K, produces a secondary splitting.

40|$|The {{operation}} {{of a wide variety}} of applications in today's modern society are heavily dependent on the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials and their interaction with electromagnetic fields. The understanding of these interactions and the associated loss mechanisms is therefore crucial for the improvement and future development of such applications. This thesis is concerned with electromagnetic waves in media with ferromagnetic losses. We model the dynamics of the magnetization of a ferromagnetic material with the nonlinear Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation and study stability conditions on static solutions. Furthermore, with the aid of a small signal analysis this equation is linearized around a stable static solution. From this analysis we obtain a small signal permeability, which shows that ferromagnetic material in general are gyrotropic with a resonant frequency behavior similar to that of a Lorentz material. In difference to dielectric Lorentz material, this resonance frequency can be shifted with the aid of a bias field. For a specific bias field we obtain a frequency behavior that mimics that of a material with electric conductivity losses. In terms of losses per unit volume it is then possible to define a magnetic conductivity which is independent of frequency. We treat composite materials built from ferromagnetic inclusions in a nonmagnetic and nonconductinig background material. The composite material inherits the gyrotropic structure and resonant behavior of the single particle. The resonance frequency of the composite material is found to be independent of the volume fraction, unlike dielectric composite materials. For small enough particles, typically around 100 nm, it becomes energetically favorable to form a single domain in the particle, where disturbances in the magnetization can propagate in the form of <b>spin</b> <b>waves.</b> We study the possibility of exciting <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> and derive a susceptibility that takes <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> into account. It is found that <b>spin</b> <b>wave</b> <b>resonances</b> are excited in the gigahertz range and this could offer a way to increase the losses in a composite material. We also discuss some concerns regarding stability and causality of effective material parameters for biased ferromagnetic materials. Finally, we discuss the possibility of using magnetic materials in absorbing applications. We analyze the scattering of electromagnetic waves from a metal surface covered with a thin magnetic lossy sheet. It is found that very thin magnetic layers can provide substantial specular absorption over a wide frequency band. However, magnetic specular absorbers, where the waves propagates just a fraction of the wavelength in the material, seem to require a certain amount of ferromagnetic material which make them quite heavy and thereby limit its practical use. On the other hand, for nonspecular absorbers where the waves propagates several wavelengths in the material, the amount of magnetic material required for efficient absorption seems to be substantially less than for specular absorbers. Thus, as nonspecular absorbers, magnetic lossy materials could offer very thin and light designs. QC 2010090...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the microscopic, quantum mechanical theory of exchange-dominated spin waves in Heisenberg ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic thin films including {{the effects of}} nonuniaxial single-ion anisotropy. The results constitute a generalization of previous theoretical studies on spin waves in thin films with uniaxial anisotropy and in semi-infinite ferromagnets with nonuniaxial anisotropy.;A spin Hamiltonian containing nearest-neighbour exchange terms, Zeeman terms, and single-ion anisotropy terms is used. The films may be asymmetric with respect to surface exchange and anisotropy parameters which are also assured to be perturbed from the bulk values. The results apply both to {{cases in which the}} nonuniaxial anisotropy is an intrinsic aspect of the material and where it arises only at the surfaces as a consequence of lowered symmetry for those sites. Low temperatures are assumed where the linear spin-wave approximation is valid. The formalism is developed for arbitrary film thickness, arbitrary quantum spin number S, and perpendicular magnetization. Simple cubic (001) ferromagnetic systems and body-centered tetragonal (001) antiferromagnetic systems are specifically examined with extensions to other situations outlined.;A theoretical approach based on the equation-of-motion method is used to find Green functions which provide expressions for the dispersion relations for surface and quantized bulk spin waves, the associated spectral intensities, transverse spin correlation functions, and the dynamic response of the system in, for example, light scattering and <b>spin</b> <b>wave</b> <b>resonance</b> experiments.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation has been a theoretical and experimental understanding of ferromagnetic resonance phenomena in ferromagnetic thin films, and a consequent understanding of several important physical properties of these films. Significant results have been obtained by ferromagnetic resonance, hysteresis, torque magnetometer, He ion backscattering, and X-ray fluorescence measurements for nickel-iron alloy films. Taking into account all relevant magnetic fields, including the applied, demagnetizing, effective anisotropy and exchange fields, the <b>spin</b> <b>wave</b> <b>resonance</b> condition applicable to the thin film geometry is presented. On {{the basis of the}} simple exchange interaction model it is concluded that the normal resonance modes of an ideal film are expected to be unpinned. The possibility of nonideality near the surface of a real film was considered by means of surface anisotropy field, inhomogeneity in demagnetizing field and inhomogeneity of magnetization models. Numerical results obtained for reasonable parameters in all cases show that they negligibly perturb the resonance fields and the higher order mode shapes from those of the unpinned modes of ideal films for thicknesses greater than 1000 Å. On the other hand for films thinner than 1000 Å the resonance field deviations can be significant even though the modes are very nearly unpinned. A previously unnoticed but important feature of all three models is that the interpretation of the first resonance mode as the uniform mode of an ideal film allows an accurate measurement of the average effective demagnetizing field over the film volume. Furthermore, it is demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} choose parameters which give indistinguishable predictions for all three models, making it difficult to uniquely ascertain the source of spin pinning in real films from resonance measurements alone. <b>Spin</b> <b>wave</b> <b>resonance</b> measurements of 81...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} Fermi surface instabilities of the Pomeranchuk {{type in the}} spin triplet channel with high orbital partial waves (F_l^a (l> 0)). The ordered phases are {{classified}} into two classes, dubbed the α and β-phases by analogy to the superfluid ^ 3 He-A and B-phases. The Fermi surfaces in the α-phases exhibit spontaneous anisotropic distortions, while those in the β-phases remain circular or spherical with topologically non-trivial spin configurations in momentum space. In the α-phase, the Goldstone modes in the density channel exhibit anisotropic overdamping. The Goldstone modes in the spin channel have nearly isotropic underdamped dispersion relation at small propagating wavevectors. Due to the coupling to the Goldstone modes, the <b>spin</b> <b>wave</b> spectrum develops <b>resonance</b> peaks in both the α and β-phases, which can be detected in inelastic neutron scattering experiments. In the p-wave channel β-phase, a chiral ground state inhomogeneity is spontaneously generated due to a Lifshitz-like instability in the originally nonchiral systems. Possible experiments to detect these phases are discussed. Comment: 26 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
40|$|The magnons {{transport}} {{properties of}} molecular wires connecting two Heisenberg ferromagnets are studied {{within the framework}} of the matching method and with use of a realistic atomic structure. The model system consists of two nanostructured ferromagnetic films on either side of the junction and the atomic wire consists of a linear molecule connecting two ultrathin solid ferromagnetic films. A theoretical model is presented for the study of the transmission and the reflection of <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> at the atomic wire junction. The calculation was made at the atomic scale for two identical waveguides with ordered spins and coupled by Heisenberg exchange interaction between first neighbors. Our analysis yields a detailed understanding of the spin-wave coherent scattering at the linear molecular junction. We calculate, in particular, the coherent reflection R and transmission T coefficients, which constitute the elements of the scattering matrix in accordance with the Landauer–Büttiker scattering formalism, as well as the magnon transmittance of the atomic wire for spin-waves incident from the interior of the film on the junction. The most representative numerical results obtained for the system of two slabs made up of three Fe ferromagnetic atomic layers connected with an Fe or Gd atomic wire are presented as function of the dimensionless frequency Ω in the magnons energy band. The coherent reflection and transmission scattering cross sections show characteristic spectral features, depending on the length of the wire, on the cut-off frequencies for the propagating magnons, as well as on the magnons incidence angle. The results illustrate the occurrence of Fano resonances in the transmitted spectra due to the interaction of localized spin states on the atomic wire with the propagating <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> of the waveguide. An interesting physical effect is observed for this magnetic atomic junction, namely the frequency selective conductance of the <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> via Fano <b>resonances,</b> by an appropriate choice of the spin-wave incident angle.
