25|$|After forming up, {{the sector}} {{controller}} asked the squadron {{to set up}} their pip-squeak system {{so they could be}} tracked. Once their location was measured and transferred to the sector plotting table, the controller would relay instructions to the formation leader. Vectoring was accomplished using the methods developed in the Biggin Hill exercises in 1935, with the <b>sector</b> <b>commander</b> comparing the location of the friendly aircraft with the hostile plots being transferred from group and arranging the interception. As the fighters were faster and often reached the interception point first, they orbited the location, giving them time to climb and seek an advantageous position.|$|E
25|$|The {{news of the}} crash, {{initially}} {{reported as}} an explosion of UNAMIR's ammunition dump, was quickly relayed to UNAMIR Force Commander Dallaire. He ordered UNAMIR Kigali <b>sector</b> <b>commander</b> Luc Marchal to send a patrol to the crash site. Numerous people began calling UNAMIR seeking information, including Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana and Lando Ndasingwa. Uwilingiyimana informed Dallaire that {{she was trying to}} gather her cabinet but many ministers were afraid to leave their families. She also reported that all of the hardline ministers had disappeared. Dallaire asked the prime minister if she could confirm that it was the president's plane that had crashed, and called UNAMIR political head Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh to inform him of developments. Uwilingiyimana called back to confirm that it was the president's jet and he was presumed to be on board. She also asked for UNAMIR help in regaining control of the political situation, as she was legally next in the line of succession, but some moderate ministers allied to her had already begun fleeing their homes, fearing for their safety.|$|E
25|$|At 8:38am, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in Boston, Massachusetts, {{reported}} a possible hijacking {{and called the}} Otis Air National Guard Base control tower on Cape Cod, home to the Massachusetts ANG's 102d Fighter Wing, to request military assistance. At that time, Major Dan Nash and Lieutenant Colonel Tim Duffy had air defense alert duty for the 102d. At 8:40am Colonel Bob Marr, a Massachusetts Air National Guardsman serving as NORAD's Northeast Air Defense <b>Sector</b> <b>commander,</b> learned from the FAA that American Airlines Flight 11 might have been hijacked.

2500|$|In late September 1977, a {{group of}} Japanese Red Army terrorists hijacked an {{aeroplane}} and forced it to land in Dhaka. On 30 September, while {{the attention of the}} government was riveted on this event, a mutiny broke out in Bogra. Although the mutiny was quickly quelled on the night of 2 October, a second mutiny started in Dhaka, led by disgruntled airmen of Bangladesh Air Force (BAF). The mutineers unsuccessfully attacked Zia's residence, captured Dhaka Radio for a short time and killed a good number of air force officers and airmen at Tejgaon International Airport, where they were gathered for negotiations with the hijackers. Wing Commander M. Hamidullah Khan BP (<b>Sector</b> <b>Commander</b> Bangladesh Defense Forces Sector 11), then BAF Ground Defense Commander, quickly put down the rebellion within the Air Force, but the government was severely shaken. Chief of Air Staff AVM AG Mahmud reappointed Wing Commander Hamidullah as Provost Marshal of BAF. Government intelligence had failed and Zia promptly dismissed the DGFI chief, AVM Aminul Islam Khan BAF, of 9th GD(P) formerly of PAF, and also the DG-NSI. In the aftermath at least 200 soldiers involved in the coup attempt were executed following a secret trial, prompting some critics to call Zia [...] "ruthless".|$|E
