5|$|The 1948 season saw Maryland <b>slide</b> <b>to</b> a 6–4 record, {{but they}} {{delivered}} four shutouts and lost {{two of their}} games by a combined three points. Two of their four losses came against ranked conference opponents, and a third was a 34-point shutout {{at the hands of}} Vanderbilt. Future two-time Heisman runner-up Charlie Justice helped North Carolina to a 29-point romp over the Terrapins.|$|E
5|$|The AP preseason poll ranked Maryland {{second in}} the nation. The Terrapins {{recorded}} a 37-point shutout of 19th-ranked Georgia and defeated 20th-ranked Navy, 38–7. Maryland finished {{the season with a}} No. 13 final ranking. Their loss at Mississippi ended a 22-game winning streak for the Terrapins. Tatum blamed the Terrapins' late season <b>slide</b> <b>to</b> injuries suffered by star quarterback Scarbath and weariness from the grueling road schedule.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} of earthquakes caused widespread landslides {{from the coast}} to east of Scotia and from the northern extent of the Eel River basin near Thompson Hill to south of Petrolia. Most of these were existing landslides that had been re-initiated and {{the largest of the}} slides were either slumps or bedding plane failures along the coastal bluffs. Several slump failures between Guthrie Creek and Oil Creek stretched from the bluffs out towards the shore for a distance of , leaving some of the <b>slide</b> <b>to</b> be eroded by the surf. The road between Ferndale and Petrolia was closed {{for more than a week}} where about six mostly minor landslides blocked the passage, with the roadway itself sustaining light damage due to sliding or settlement of the road fill in a few instances. One of the largest slides occurred along the railroad tracks at the Scotia bluffs where previous slides had taken place. That slide also took about a week to clear.|$|E
50|$|A jackline {{is also a}} rope {{installed}} in the luff of a mainsail to allow the luff <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> migrate horizontally away from the mast when the sail is reefed. By allowing the <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> migrate, more space is left in the mast track for the upper luff <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> descend, making the operation easier.|$|R

25|$|When bait-fishing in pacu-stocked ponds, anglers in Malaysia {{are advised}} to use circle hooks, size 2 or larger, and braided leather rather than nylon leaders which are easily broken by the pacu's teeth. Since pond pacu often nibble at the bait before taking it, anglers should let them swim away with the bait. If the angler simply allows the line to tighten, the circle hook will <b>slide</b> <b>to</b> {{the side of the}} fish's mouth and embed its point there.|$|E
25|$|The upper {{panel in}} the image at right shows a ball in {{circular}} motion on a banked curve. The curve is banked at an angle θ from the horizontal, and {{the surface of the}} road is considered to be slippery. The objective is to find what angle the bank must have so the ball does not slide off the road. Intuition tells us that, on a flat curve with no banking at all, the ball will simply slide off the road; while with a very steep banking, the ball will <b>slide</b> <b>to</b> the center unless it travels the curve rapidly.|$|E
25|$|One-day specialists New Zealand won {{all their}} matches in Group D, {{beginning}} with a comfortable five-wicket win over Kenya (Kenya 144/8; New Zealand 145/5) before an even more straightforward success against Scotland. The New Zealanders amassed 278/6 (Fleming 102, Parore 87), then Harris took 4–25 as Scotland could manage only 101 all out. Finally the Kiwis won the crunch match against Pakistan by 81 runs: New Zealand's 215/8 was boosted by 66 from Fleming despite Shoaib Akhtar's 4–47, but only three Pakistanis (and Extras) reached double figures as they lost their last six wickets for 21 runs, being bowled out for 134 to <b>slide</b> <b>to</b> an 81-run defeat.|$|E

25|$|The P7 is a {{semi-automatic}} blowback-operated firearm. It {{features a}} unique gas-delayed blowback locking system {{modeled on the}} Swiss Pistole 47 W+F (Waffenfabrik Bern) prototype pistol (and ultimately on the Barnitzke system first used in the Volkssturmgewehr 1-5), which used gas pressures from the ignited cartridge and fed them through a small port in the barrel (in front of the chamber) to retard the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished {{by means of a}} piston contained inside a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined—after the bullet has left the barrel—hence allowing the <b>slide</b> <b>to</b> end its rearward motion, opening the breech and ejecting the empty cartridge case.|$|E
25|$|Operating {{systems that}} run on {{smartphones}} and tablets typically use a gestures based lock-screen. Mobiles manufactured by Neonode were unlocked by swiping to the right on its touchscreen. Apple's iOS, used by the iPhone and iPad lines, utilizes a similar unlock mechanism using an on-screen slider widget to the right. Beginning on iOS 5, sliding {{in the other direction}} sends the user directly to the camera app. On iOS 7, the slider widget was removed {{as part of a larger}} overhaul of the iOS interface, and users can now swipe from any point of the screen. The lock screen also displays a clock, notifications, and provides audio playback controls. In iOS 10 the <b>slide</b> <b>to</b> unlock feature was replaced with the Press Home to Unlock feature.|$|E
25|$|As {{it became}} clear in the early 1990s {{that the country was}} destined for black {{majority}} rule and one reform after the other was announced, uncertainty {{about the future of the}} country hastened the depreciation until the level of R 3 to the dollar was breached in November 1992. A host of local and international events influenced the currency after that, most notably the 1994 democratic election which had it weaken to over R3.60 to the dollar, the election of Tito Mboweni as the new governor of the South African Reserve Bank, and the inauguration of President Thabo Mbeki in 1999 which had it quickly <b>slide</b> <b>to</b> over R6 to the dollar. The controversial land reform program that was kicked off in Zimbabwe, followed by the September 11, 2001 attacks, propelled it to its weakest historical level of R13.84 to the dollar in December 2001.|$|E

50|$|Film {{scanners}} {{can accept}} either strips of 35 mm or 120 film, or individual slides. Low-end scanners typically only take 35mm film strips, while medium- and high-end film scanners often have interchangeable film loaders. This allows the one scanning platform {{to be used}} for different sizes and packaging. For example, some allow microscope <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> be loaded for scanning, while mechanised slide loaders allow many individual <b>slides</b> <b>to</b> be batch scanned unattended.|$|R

25|$|The 'slide', {{the most}} {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} trombone (cf. valve trombone), allows the player to extend {{the length of the}} air column, lowering the pitch. To prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves were developed during the Renaissance, and these stockings were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes. Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner slide tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the <b>slide</b> <b>to</b> the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend). The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a ferrule to secure the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism to tighten the joint.|$|E
25|$|Leishmaniasis is {{diagnosed}} in the hematology laboratory by direct visualization of the amastigotes (Leishman-Donovan bodies). Buffy-coat preparations of peripheral blood or aspirates from marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, or skin lesions should be spread on a <b>slide</b> <b>to</b> make a thin smear and stained with Leishman stain or Giemsa stain (pH 7.2) for 20 minutes. Amastigotes are seen within blood and spleen monocytes or, less commonly, in circulating neutrophils and in aspirated tissue macrophages. They are small, round bodies 2–4 μm in diameter with indistinct cytoplasm, a nucleus, and a small, rod-shaped kinetoplast. Occasionally, amastigotes {{may be seen}} lying free between cells. However, the retrieval of tissue samples is often painful for the patient and identification of the infected cells can be difficult. So, other indirect immunological methods of diagnosis are developed, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, antigen-coated dipsticks, and direct agglutination test. Although these tests are readily available, {{they are not the}} standard diagnostic tests due to their insufficient sensitivity and specificity.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} part of the Battle of Spotsylvania, the 1st Brigade {{occupied}} the extreme right of the Union line. After being detached for a brief reconnaissance to Todd’s Tavern, the 140th rejoined the brigade in its <b>slide</b> <b>to</b> the east, closer to the left end of the Union line. There, early on the morning of May 12 they took part in the massive assault on the part of the Confederate line known as the “Mule Shoe.” The men had to pick their way through trees felled to form an abatis before making their way up to the Mule Shoe, where they managed to dislodge the Rebels from their first line, but were unable to proceed further, having to settle into the works just captured. On May 15 the 1st Division was ordered to the rear and occupied this position until the 21st, when they joined Grant’s next flank movement to the east toward North Anna River. The movement to and actions at Spotsylvania cost the regiment 41 men killed, 125 officers and men wounded, and 10 men missing, for a total of 176.|$|E
