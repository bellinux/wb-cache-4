[...] Wen noted that [...] "The connection is there, but it’s also very tenuous at this point, because S.H.I.E.L.D. has become so isolated with what’s going on with the Avengers and them not knowing still that Coulson is alive." [...] On how the themes of Civil War allowed the series to make more of a philosophical tie-in than with previous films, Whedon stated that [...] "we do have people across the globe who have powers on our show and there would be varying reactions to that.

50|$|Problem {{structuring}} methods (PSMs) are a {{group of}} techniques used to model or to map the nature or structure of a situation or state of affairs that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> change. PSMs are usually used by {{a group of}} people in collaboration (rather than by a solitary individual) to create a consensus about, or at least to facilitate negotiations about, what needs to change. Some widely adopted PSMs include soft systems methodology, the strategic choice approach, and strategic options development and analysis (SODA).|$|E
50|$|Mingers and Rosenhead {{have noted}} that there are {{similarities}} and differences between PSMs and large group methods such as Future Search, Open Space Technology, and others. PSMs and large group methods both bring people together to talk about, and to share different perspectives on, a situation or state of affairs that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> change. However, PSMs always focus on creating a sufficiently rigorous conceptual model or cognitive map of the situation, whereas large group methods do not necessarily emphasize modeling, and PSMs are not necessarily used with large groups of people.|$|E
50|$|There is no widely {{accepted}} measure {{of what is}} a healthy level for sex desire. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have sex every day, or {{more than once a}} day; others once a year or not at all.

A sexual desire disorder is more common in women than in men. Erectile dysfunction can only occur in men and may be {{because of the lack of}} sexual desire, however, these two should not be confused. For example, large recreational doses of amphetamine or methamphetamine can simultaneously cause erectile dysfunction and significantly increase libido. However, men can also experience a decrease in their libido as they age.|$|E

50|$|The Cherokee have debated {{how to use}} the land, with <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> {{develop the}} {{property}} for community uses. Non-invasive archaeological surveys have discovered 15 burials, with the likelihood of up to 1000. A gradiometer was used to map the area.

These discoveries have led more of the Cherokee citizens to consider only such development as can be compatible with the sacred nature of the site. They are planning uses associated with community wellness and renewal. The Eastern Cherokee have sponsored two youth retreats at the site, which highlighted traditional ways of spiritual expression.|$|R
