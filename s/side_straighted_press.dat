50|$|The {{bolster plate}} {{is mounted on}} top of the press bed and is a large block of metal upon which the bottom portion of a die is clamped; the bolster plate is stationary. Large presses (like the ones used in the {{automotive}} industry) may be equipped die cushions integrated in the bolster plate to apply blank holder or counter draw forces. This is necessary when a single acting press is used for deep drawing. The ram / slide is the moving or reciprocating member that the upper die is mounted to. Ram or Slide guidance is a critical element to assure long die life between die maintenance. Different types of slide guides are available, 4 point V-Gibs or 6 point square gibs on smaller presses and 8 point full length slide guides on larger <b>straight</b> <b>side</b> frame <b>presses.</b> With the dies and material be fed into the die between the bolster and slide, good press designs must account for plastic deformation, other wise known as defection when frame design and loads are considered.|$|R

5000|$|Lasagnette {{is a type}} of ribbon pasta. It is a {{narrower}} version of lasagna. Characteristics of lasagnette differ based on the form of their edges. Different kinds could have edges with a waved cut on both <b>sides,</b> <b>straight</b> cut edges on both side, or a variation including one <b>side</b> with a <b>straight</b> cut and the other with a waved cut. Lasagnette can be prepared in various forms; the two most popular involve a thinner version of the traditional layered Italian lasagna. The second version combines ingredients of the recipe with the pasta, and is served tossed on a plate.|$|R

Like a pointer to a quail, {{he made his way}} down the levee <b>side</b> <b>straight</b> to the camp of a credulous and ancient fisherman, whom he charmed with song and story, so that he dined like an admiral, and then like a philosopher annihilated the worst three hours of the day by a nap under the trees.|$|R
50|$|In the Landesliga, {{the club}} {{achieved}} two good seasons after relegation, finishing fifth and sixth, but then declined and was {{relegated to the}} Bezirksoberliga Oberfranken in 1994. A league championship at this level however took the <b>side</b> <b>straight</b> back to the Landesliga. But overall, the club now entered an era of financial struggle, culminating in the necessity of having to sell its stadium to survive, which it since {{has been able to}} purchase back.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{breaking}} {{both his}} wrist and leg in 1933-34, Crayston was signed by First Division champions Arsenal in 1934 {{as a replacement for}} Charlie Jones. He scored on his competitive debut in an 8-1 thrashing of Liverpool on 1 September 1934 and became a regular in the Arsenal <b>side</b> <b>straight</b> away, largely pushing Frank Hill out of the right-half spot. With Arsenal he won the League championship in 1934-35 and 1937-38, and the FA Cup in 1935-36.|$|R

5000|$|On the {{negative}} {{end of the}} spectrum, many critics denounced the show for being too formulaic. Hal Boedeker of The Orlando Sentinel called the show [...] "hopelessly tired and old hat." [...] Rosenbaum similarly stated, [...] "Familiar stereotypes have always earned easy howls, from minstrel shows and old-time burlesque to political cartoons that deploy exaggeration as parody. The especially obnoxious ones ultimately fail when the multitudes realize their humor is not only hollow but at times twisted and even dangerous." [...] Mapa later lashed back at that review in The Advocate saying, [...] "I was totally slammed in the <b>straight</b> <b>press...</b> The L.A. Times called my portrayal 'dangerous.'

The new cell consists of a container with two <b>straight</b> <b>sides</b> intersecting at 45 ~ and two curved sides consisting of rectangular hyperbolic ylinders orthogonal to each other, and each in turn orthogonal to one of the <b>straight</b> <b>sides.</b> One of the <b>straight</b> <b>sides</b> and its opposite curved surface are insulators, the other <b>straight</b> <b>side</b> is the cathode while the remaining curved surface is the anode. The new cell may not only be used for current density studies, but may also be used to determine the total polarization directly from simple measurements onthe cell com-bined with the electrical conductivity of the solution.
