The rectangular boxes rotate evenly to create a subtle movement, with small arched windows at regular intervals into the limestone exterior. The museum's coordinators were pleased with the project; its official website describes its [...] "true splendour unveiled in the sunlight", and speaks of [...] "the shades of colour and the interplay of <b>shadows</b> <b>paying</b> tribute to the essence of Islamic architecture".|$|R

Moreover, they practice 14 moral precepts such as cleaning feet before entering a home, donating food to monks, avoiding stepping on a monk's <b>shadow,</b> <b>paying</b> respect to parents, paying homage to Buddha images with flowers, candles, and joss sticks and learning Dhamma every day. Most people in Amphoe Chanuman are descendants of the Phu Thai ethnic group who migrated from Laos. They specialise in weaving [...] "khit" [...] cloth, preserving its unique patterns. Their traditional musical performance [...] "mor lam" [...] always supports the democratic constitutional monarchy. Amnat Charoen people try to retain the [...] "long khuang" [...] tradition which consisted of teenagers meeting up for communal activities such as weaving or silk spinning accompanied by lively traditional music.|$|R

Comparative statics shows {{that within a}} wide range of model parameters, a basic researcher holding a patent is able to extract all of the profit facilitated by the basic innovation. The patent holder achieves this by offering a licensing contract which the subsequent innovator accepts in the <b>shadow</b> of <b>paying</b> infringement damages. It is further demonstrated that, under rather general circumstances, broader patent breadth may diminish the patent holders incentive to innovate: that is to extract all of the profit from the subsequent innovator commercializing the innovation. ...|$|R

40|$|Shadow {{features}} such as colour ratio, texture, and chromaticity {{have proved to be}} quite effective in shadow detection. Many shadow detection methods have been proposed on the basis of different features. However, previous works for shadow detection mainly focus on designing an effective classifier for existing <b>shadow</b> features, but <b>pay</b> less attention on the analysis of shadow features themselves. The majority of studies simply report the final shadow detection results rather than make an evaluation on each feature. Readers often do not know which features are more effective or whether these shadow features are complementary. The following problems are still unsolved: the robustness of each feature, which feature plays the most important role in a detection method, and what is the best performance that current features can reach. The {{purpose of this study is}} to answer these questions, and the authors hope that this study can offer guidance for future shadow detection algorithms via the evaluation of frequently used shadow features. Several useful and interesting conclusions are obtained after conducting extensive comparison experiments on a large dataset...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to examine <b>shadow</b> bankin g, <b>paying</b> {{particular}} attention to European securitisation markets, collateral intermediation, and money market funds. The term wa s introduced following the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis to describe credit intermediation activities undertaken partially or full y outside the regulated banking system, without explicit access to public sector backstops. The shadow banking sector’s dependency on short - term, wholesale funding renders it vulnerable to market turmoil, which in turn can affect the broader financial syst em through the sector’s close connection with financial institutions and key markets. In order to contextualize this topic the first chapter describes how credit intermediation is conducted within certain sectors of the shadow banking system, and what su pply and demand - side factors precipitated {{the rise of the}} system. The initial chapter also offers a brief overview of shadow banking’s role in the financial crisis, since the evolution of the term and the on - going discourse surrounding it is closely tied t o the stressed market conditions witnessed at the time. While initially, the thesis is most relevant in a US context since it was there the financial innovations discussed have been developed and widely adopted, the second chapter provides a n assessment of the European system. First, by performing a macro - mapping exercise aimed at providing a broad measure of the shadow banking system, and second, by conducting a more detailed analysis of institutions that serve as the focus for this thesis. The thesis demo nstrates that European shadow banking institutions fund the extension of credit, that they are important intermediaries in the short - term funding markets, and that they support a host of financial transactions. Although prevailing commentary on shadow bank ing has highlighted the systemic risk brought about by shadow banking, this thesis seeks to take a balanced view of the sector, also emphasising its positive impact on overall markets. nhhma...|$|R
