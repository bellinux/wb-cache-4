I'm running my career. That comes with being labeled a bitch. If that's what I'm gonna be called by being {{assertive}} and knowing who I am and what I want out of life, then <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>it.</b> I will wear that label proudly. For me it's about turning that word into a positive.|$|E
25|$|Tasmania {{was named}} the 'bogan capital of Australia' with Taswegians earning four spots in the final. This {{prompted}} a response from Luke Martin, CEO of Tourism Industry Council Tasmania, who affirmed that Tasmanians are friendly, down to earth and want people to share their stories and if that makes them bogans, <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>it.</b> On the island of Tasmania, half the population has literacy and/or numeracy difficulties, and {{the unemployment rate is}} higher than it is in mainland Australia.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} was purchased in 2006 by the National Portrait Gallery, London, with funds raised through their 150th anniversary gala, {{after more than}} nine months' consideration. The cost was rumoured {{to be more than}} £100,000, though Zarin gives a price of £95,000. The acquisition was criticised by Starkey, who said, [...] "if the National Portrait Gallery has public money to burn, then <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>it</b> ... depends on mere hearsay and tradition, and it is not good enough". Foley countered, [...] "The evidence has been supported by people who know far more about the science of painting than David Starkey. I don't know what his problem is– is it because he didn't find it?" ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Watson {{said he was}} not {{offended}} by his portrayal in the episode, and was glad [...] "Whale Whores" [...] brought the issue of dolphin and whale slaughter to a large audience, as well as the role of the Japanese in the deaths. Watson said, [...] "It's a tough situation we are in. We can't hurt the whalers and we have to stay within the boundaries of the law in opposing illegal whaling operations. If that makes us pussies, <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>it.</b> It's better than being portrayed as killers." [...] Watson said the episode failed to portray that his actions have hurt Japanese profits from whaling, but that the episode demonstrated how successful Whale Wars and the Sea Shepherd has been.|$|E

500|$|Karen Tye spoke favourably of the album, {{saying they}} had [...] "ditched the cutesy voices and effervescent ditties" [...] and {{replaced}} it with acoustic pop and rock which occasionally bordered on country. She praised M2M for using [...] "down-to-earhtunes and thoughtful lyrics" [...] instead of revealing outfits to propel them into the limelight, unlike many of their pop counterparts. Conversely, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic was critical of M2M's new image in the album artwork. Erlewine said they had ditched their sweet and innocent look from Shades of Purple, for [...] "lots of makeup, crimped hair [...] fairly low-cut tops". He gave the album four and a half stars out of five, concluding [...] "If M2M needs to play up their good looks to sell an album this pleasing, <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>it.</b> This is an album that deserves to find its audience, even through tactics as blatant as that." ...|$|E
500|$|Among {{the most}} {{critical}} voices were Sam Jordison and Michael Hann, both of The Guardian. Jordison detailed his misgivings about A Game of Thrones in a 2009 review and summarized [...] "It's daft. It's unsophisticated. It's cartoonish. And yet, I couldn't stop reading.... Archaic absurdity aside, Martin's writing is excellent. His dialogue is snappy and frequently funny. His descriptive prose is immediate and atmospheric, {{especially when it comes}} to building a sense of deliciously dark foreboding [...]" [...] Hann did not consider the novels to stand out from the general fantasy genre, despite Martin's alterations to fantasy convention, although he rediscovered his childhood's views:That when things are, on the whole, pretty crappy , it's a deep joy to dive headfirst into something so completely immersive, something from which there is no need to surface from hours at a time. And if that immersion involves dragons, magic, wraiths from beyond death, shapeshifting wolves and banished princes, <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

[...] In a 1990 column in the Stanford Daily, Booker admitted that as a teenager he had [...] "hated gays". [...] Booker has himself been the target of rumors about being gay and has generally refused to address these on principle, which he explained in 2013: Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I'm gay, and I say, [...] "So what does it matter if I am? <b>So</b> <b>be</b> <b>it.</b> I hope you are not voting for me because you are making the presumption that I'm straight." ...|$|E

500|$|Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club {{suggested}} that the influence of Endtroducing..... {{may have had a}} negative effect on the album itself, saying that it [...] "has been partially diluted by the symphonic beat-collage culture it helped spawn." [...] The album's acclaim set considerably high standards for future releases by DJ Shadow, and he has expressed his dissatisfaction with being expected to [...] "repeat Endtroducing..... over and over again". Despite this, DJ Shadow {{has made it clear that}} he views the album in a positive light and denies any pressure that may have come about as a result of the album's praise: [...] "...people always seem to suggest that there's this pressure, and that Endtroducing..... is some kind of albatross, and I've just honestly never felt that way. I think that I have a healthy enough respect for the lineage of the music and how rare it is that you can connect with an audience. If that will always be 'the record' then <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>it,</b> that's cool." [...] As of April 26, 2005, Endtroducing..... has sold upwards of 290,000 copies in the United States alone.|$|E
