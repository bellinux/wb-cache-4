It was {{nothing less than the}} receipt of a letter by Fred from his cousin Isobel! Fred and Isobel, having been brought up for several years together, felt towards each other like brother and sister.|$|E
50|$|A bann flake is a large, butt-trimmed, leaf-shaped lithic {{blade of}} flint or chert, {{dating from the}} Late Mesolithic period in Ireland (6000-4500 BC). They are named after the river Bann in Northern Ireland and were used as spear heads, being {{attached}} to wooden shafts. They {{are part of the}} Bann culture assemblage.Peter Woodman of University College Cork defines them as large flakes without a significant tang, with only light retouch. They come in two forms: elongated or laminar forms less than 3.2 cm across, or wider leaf shapes having only very peripheral retouch at the butt. This particular Bann Flake is surrounded by rhyolite fond on the site of a medieval <b>solitary</b> <b>settlement</b> in Clogheen townland. This Bann Flake was manufactured with materials that were not found nearby. Geological examinations at NUI Galway suggests that this object is made of rare igneous rock, originated from the Tardee area of County Antrim. Clogheen and The Tardee area are, an estimate 200km apart and it would have taken great effort to transport the rare rock from such a considerable distance. Its presence in the Clogheen area suggests that there must have been an elaborate process in the migration of people, where they took this artifact to other areas as use for trade or its importance as a tool. Its purpose is yet unknown, as it suggests Bann Flake were made of igneous rock, these were not commonly used as tools. The only places that have use for these Bann Flakes are where occur naturally in localized regions.|$|E

While {{it has been shown}} that juveniles of brooding corals fuse under experimental conditions, chimera formation in broadcast spawning corals, the most abundant group of reef corals, has not been examined. This study explores the capacity of the broadcast spawning coral Acropora millepora to form chimeras under experimental conditions and to persist as chimeras in the field. Under experimental conditions, 1. 5 -fold more larvae settled in aggregations than solitarily, and analyses of nine microsatellite loci revealed that 50 per cent of juveniles tested harboured different genotypes within the same colony. Significantly, some chimeric colonies persisted for 23 months post-settlement, when the study ended. Genotypes within persisting chimeric colonies all showed a high level of relatedness, whereas rejecting colonies displayed variable levels of relatedness. The nearly threefold greater sizes of chimeras compared with <b>solitary</b> juveniles, from <b>settlement</b> through to at least three months, suggest that chimerism is likely to be an important strategy for maximizing survival of vulnerable early life-history stages of corals, although longer-term studies are required to more fully explore the potential benefits of chimerism...|$|R
