25|$|The first {{electric}} {{passenger train}} was presented by Werner von Siemens at Berlin in 1879. The locomotive {{was driven by}} a 2.2kW, <b>series-wound</b> <b>motor,</b> and the train, consisting of the locomotive and three cars, reached a speed of 13km/h. During four months, the train carried 90,000 passengers on a 300-metre-long (984 feet) circular track. The electricity (150 V DC) was supplied through a third insulated rail between the tracks. A contact roller was used to collect the electricity.|$|E
2500|$|At standstill, main {{generator}} output is initially low voltage/high current, often {{in excess of}} 1000 amperes per motor at full power. [...] When the locomotive is at or near standstill, current flow will be limited only by the DC resistance of the motor windings and interconnecting circuitry, {{as well as the}} capacity of the {{main generator}} itself. [...] Torque in a <b>series-wound</b> <b>motor</b> is approximately proportional to the square of the current. Hence, the traction motors will produce their highest torque, causing the locomotive to develop maximum tractive effort, enabling it to overcome the inertia of the train. This effect is analogous to what happens in an automobile automatic transmission at start-up, where it is in first gear and thus producing maximum torque multiplication.|$|E
5000|$|The Baker of 1910 was {{the only}} {{electric}} that had a heavy <b>series-wound</b> <b>motor</b> of 300 percent overload capacity, with a commutator [...] "absolutely proof against sparking and burning under all conditions." ...|$|E
50|$|The 50 Hz (60 Hz in North America) AC grid {{was already}} {{established}} {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century. Although <b>series-wound</b> <b>motors</b> can in principle run on AC as well as DC (the reason they are also known as universal <b>motors)</b> large <b>series-wound</b> traction <b>motors</b> had problems with such high frequencies. High inductive reactance of the motor windings caused commutator flashover problems and the non-laminated magnetic pole-pieces originally designed for DC exhibited excessive eddy current losses. Using a lower AC frequency alleviated both problems.|$|R
5000|$|The Advanced DC {{drive motor}} {{that comes with}} the Power Kit offered through EV parts on the BugE website [...] is a <b>series-wound</b> DC <b>motor</b> This is one of the three most popular motors used for {{electric}} vehicles. The DC motor is known for its torque but falls short in those areas where hills are abundant.There are two main types of DC motors, brushed and brushless.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{have two}} 3-axled bogies. Each axle {{is powered by}} a single-phase, <b>series-wound,</b> AC <b>motor.</b> The torque is transferred by a double-sided spur gear to a hollow shaft, and by an elastic rubber cone flange to the wheels. Each motor has an own cooling blower. Two scissor-shaped pantographs collect the current of 15 kV / 16.7 Hz from the catenary. Recently, many of these pick-ups have been refitted as modern single-arm pantographs.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine is}} {{fitted with a}} starter motor, which is mounted on the {{crankcase}} at the exhaust side with securing clips. It is a 24 V direct current <b>series-wound</b> <b>motor</b> with a rated power of 4 kW. The three-phase current alternator has an electronic control unit. It is mounted on the exhaust side of the engine and is driven by a belt from the crankshaft.|$|E
5000|$|This is the [...] "compensated" [...] {{repulsion}} motor devised independently by Latour and by Winter-Eichberg. There are, again, {{two pairs of}} brushes but they are fixed {{at right angles to}} each other. One pair is short-circuited while the other pair is fed with variable-voltage alternating current from tappings on the secondary winding of a small transformer. The primary winding of the transformer is in series with the stator winding of the motor. This motor has the same torque/speed characteristics as an ordinary <b>series-wound</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
50|$|A slow-running, large <b>series-wound</b> <b>motor</b> with 28 {{poles and}} two commutators drove the wheels, without any gear reduction, via an {{unsprung}} jackshaft. The jackshaft was linked by a coupling rod to three driving axles {{housed in the}} locomotive frame. The axle base of the driving axles was 2000 mm. The jackshaft was located {{between the first and}} second driving axles. The first and third driving axles were fixed to the frame, the centre one had transverse play to facilitate curve running. The mass was further distributed to two carrying axles that were designed as Adams axles. Control was achieved by means of a variable transformer (Drehtransformator) and power circuit breaker (Lastschalter) with 11 steps.|$|E
40|$|Construction {{of motor}} models {{is the main}} topic of this project. Mathematical {{characterization}} of AC machine, permanent magnet synchronous motor, separately-excited DC <b>motor,</b> <b>series-wound</b> DC <b>motor,</b> permanent magnet DC motor, switched reluctance motor is also described. Design of models is based on mathematical description of particular motors. Models are created in Matlab Simulink. Each model is implemented in continuous and also in discrete time variant. Selected models are implemented also on processor from Freescale 56 F 800 E Hybrid Controller family. Each model has individual graphic user interface. Besides motor models, there is description and easy algorithm of Space Vector Modulation. Model of this method is also created. Models are build-up into a library, {{which can be used}} for simulations and tests of control structures. Results of models simulations are presented {{at the end of this}} project. Simulation of models that are implemented on processor is also made in Matlab Simulink environment and is compared to simulation of models that are implemented directly in Matlab Simulink...|$|R
50|$|The DVM-4 {{is powered}} by a Ganz-Jendrassik 16 JVF 17/24-type non-turbocharged (pre-chamber) V16 Diesel engine. The {{cylinders}} have a bore of 170 mm and a stroke of 240 mm. The locomotive has four six-pole, <b>series-wound</b> TS32-44/14 traction <b>motors</b> with forced ventilation, axle-hung and nose-suspended.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{these were}} <b>series-wound</b> brushed DC <b>motors,</b> usually running on {{approximately}} 600 volts. The availability of high-powered semiconductors (thyristors and the IGBT) has now made practical {{the use of}} much simpler, higher-reliability AC induction motors known as asynchronous traction motors. Synchronous AC motors are also occasionally used, as in the French TGV.|$|R
50|$|At standstill, main {{generator}} output is initially low voltage/high current, often {{in excess of}} 1000 amperes per motor at full power. When the locomotive is at or near standstill, current flow will be limited only by the DC resistance of the motor windings and interconnecting circuitry, {{as well as the}} capacity of the {{main generator}} itself.

5000|$|The wheels were {{designed}} and manufactured by General Motors Defense Research Laboratories in Santa Barbara, California. Ferenc Pavlics was given special recognition by NASA {{for developing the}} [...] "resilient wheel". They consisted of a spun aluminum hub and a 32 in diameter, 9 in wide tire made of zinc-coated woven 0.033 in diameter steel strands attached to the rim and discs of formed aluminum. Titanium chevrons covered 50% of the contact area to provide traction. Inside the tire was a 25.5 in diameter bump stop frame to protect the hub. Dust guards were mounted above the wheels. Each wheel had its own electric drive made by Delco, a direct current (DC) <b>series-wound</b> <b>motor</b> capable of [...] at 10,000 rpm, attached to the wheel via an 80:1 harmonic drive, and a mechanical brake unit.|$|E
50|$|The {{universal}} motor is {{so named because}} it is a type of electric motor that can operate on AC or DC power. It is a commutated <b>series-wound</b> <b>motor</b> where the stator's field coils are connected in series with the rotor windings through a commutator. It {{is often referred to as}} an AC series motor. The {{universal motor}} is very similar to a DC series motor in construction, but is modified slightly to allow the motor to operate properly on AC power. This type of electric motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field coils and the armature (and the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) synchronously with the supply. Hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a consistent direction of rotation, independent of the direction of applied voltage, but determined by the commutator and polarity of the field coils.|$|E
40|$|Vehicle maximum speed, range at {{constant}} speed, {{range over}} stop-and-go driving schedules, maximum acceleration, gradeability, gradeability limit, road energy consumption, road power, indicated energy consumption, braking capability, battery charger efficiency, and battery characteristics were determined for a modified utility van powered by sixteen 6 -volt batteries connected in series. A chopper controller actuated by a foot accelerator pedal changes the voltage {{applied to the}} 22 -kilowatt (30 -hp) <b>series-wound</b> drive <b>motor.</b> In addition to the conventional hydraulic braking system, the vehicle has hydraulic regenerative braking. Cycle tests and acceleration tests were conducted with and without hydraulic regeneration...|$|R
5000|$|Maneuvering {{capability}} {{was provided}} {{through the use}} of front and rear steering <b>motors.</b> Each <b>series-wound</b> DC steering <b>motor</b> was capable of [...] The front and rear wheels would turn in opposite directions to achieve a tight turning radius of 10 ft, or could be decoupled so only front or rear would be used for steering. They could free-wheel in case of drive failure.|$|R
50|$|Motor damage {{may occur}} from over-speeding (running at a {{rotational}} speed {{in excess of}} design limits) if the unit is operated with no significant mechanical load. On larger motors, sudden loss of load is to be avoided, {{and the possibility of}} such an occurrence is incorporated into the motor's protection and control schemes. In some smaller applications, a fan blade attached to the shaft often acts as an artificial load to limit the motor speed to a safe level, as well as a means to circulate cooling airflow over the armature and field windings. If there were no mechanical limits placed on a universal motor it could theoretically speed out of control in the same way any <b>series-wound</b> DC <b>motor</b> can.|$|R
50|$|The first {{electric}} {{passenger train}} was presented by Werner von Siemens at Berlin in 1879.

A contact roller was used to collect the electricity.The world's first electric tram line opened in Lichterfelde near Berlin, Germany, in 1881. It was built by Werner von Siemens (see Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway and Berlin Straßenbahn). Volk's Electric Railway opened in 1883 in Brighton. Also in 1883, Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram opened near Vienna in Austria. It {{was the first in}} the world in regular service powered from an overhead line. Five years later, in the U.S. electric trolleys were pioneered in 1888 on the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, using equipment designed by Frank J. Sprague.|$|E
50|$|The first {{electrified}} railways used <b>series-wound</b> DC <b>motors,</b> {{first at}} 600 V and then 1,500 V. Areas with 3 kV DC catenaries (primarily in Eastern Europe) used two 1,500 V DC motors in series. But even at 3 kV, the current needed to power a heavy train (particularly in rural and mountainous areas) can be excessive. Although increasing the transmission voltage decreases {{the current and}} associated resistive losses for a given power, insulation limits make higher voltage traction motors impractical. Transformers on each locomotive are thus required to step high transmission voltages down to practical motor operating voltages. Because transformers require alternating current (AC), high voltage electrified railways adopted AC along with the electric power distribution system (see War of Currents).|$|R
5000|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} EVcort {{was the use of}} sophisticated electronics to extract maximum efficiency from the lead-acid battery pack. All of the electronic components: controller, charger, DC/DC converter and DC/AC inverter, were designed specifically for the EVcort by Shunjiro Ohba, a PhD. electrical engineer at Soleq. The car was built under his supervision using engineless Escorts obtained directly from Ford Motor Company. Unlike other direct current (DC)-based electric vehicles of the period, which used <b>series-wound</b> <b>motors,</b> the EVcort used a separately excited (SepEx) traction motor that was built to order for the car by General Electric. This configuration allowed the inclusion of regenerative braking to maximize driving range, but required a particularly complex controller to regulate the armature and field independently. [...] The controller {{was the size of a}} suitcase and incorporated over 300 transistors. The power circuit for the armature used 120 bipolar transistors wired in parallel, giving a maximum 400 amps or 40 kWatts of traction, with another 60 bipolar transistors for regenerative braking of up to 200 amps. By automatically weakening the field current in response to armature current at high RPM, the controller maintained high motor torque over a wide range of motor speeds, allowing the car to accelerate from a standing start to 45 mph without shifting gears. [...] It operated at a relatively low pulse-width modulation (PWM) frequency of 800 Hz, thus requiring large capacitors and chokes to filter the ripple. The traction pack consisted of eighteen 6‑volt lead-acid batteries for a total of 108 volts. Initially, standard flooded golf cart batteries were used, replaced in later models by Sonnenshein gel cells. The EVcort was a highway-capable vehicle with a top speed of approximately 70 mph.|$|R
40|$|The {{propulsion}} {{system of the}} Lewis Research Center's electric {{propulsion system}} test bed vehicle was tested on the road load simulator under the DOE Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Program. This propulsion system, consisting of a <b>series-wound</b> dc <b>motor</b> controlled by an infinitely variable SCR chopper and an 84 -V battery pack, is typical of those used in electric vehicles made in 1976. Steady-state tests were conducted {{over a wide range}} of differential output torques and vehicle speeds. Efficiencies of all of the components were determined. Effects of temperature and voltage variations on the motor and the effect of voltage changes on the controller were examined. Energy consumption and energy efficiency for the system were determined over the B and C driving schedules of the SAE J 227 a test procedure...|$|R
5000|$|An EFP {{designed}} [...] {{direct current}} <b>series-wound</b> traction <b>motor</b> (the {{size of a}} one-gallon paint can) was bolted through an aluminum adapter plate to the car’s standard clutch and 3-speed manual transmission. The motor {{was similar to that}} offered to teams in the Great Electric Race and capable of speeds up to 90 mph. A total of 24 six-volt “TriPolar” cobalt-lead storage batteries were mounted under the hood and under a plywood floor in the trunk. These improved lead-cobalt batteries recharge fast and can go as many as 250 mi between charges. The company, and its president, Robert R. Aronson, was awarded several patents including the [...] "Fifth Generation Lead Cobalt Battery". One 12-volt battery was provided for the car's lights and accessories. The solid-state, stopless controller was a modified unit from a forklift truck. An auxiliary gasoline heater with a one-gallon tank provided heat and defrosting. The system was called [...] "Thunderbolt" [...] by EFP, and was billed as potentially installable in many different standard production Detroit automobiles.|$|R
5000|$|Since the <b>series-wound</b> DC <b>motor</b> {{develops}} {{its highest}} torque at low speed, {{it is often}} used in traction applications such as electric locomotives, and trams. The DC motor was the mainstay of electric traction drives on both electric and diesel-electric locomotives, street-cars/trams and diesel electric drilling rigs for many years. The introduction of DC motors and an electrical grid system to run machinery starting in the 1870s started a new second Industrial Revolution. DC motors can operate directly from rechargeable batteries, providing the motive power for the first electric vehicles and today's hybrid cars and electric cars as well as driving a host of cordless tools. Today DC motors are still found in applications as small as toys and disk drives, or in large sizes to operate steel rolling mills and paper machines. Large DC motors with separately excited fields were generally used with winder drives for mine hoists, for high torque as well as smooth speed control using thyristor drives. These are now replaced with large AC motors with variable frequency drives.|$|R
5000|$|As constructed, {{the trains}} were formed as 4-car units. A total of 22 {{vehicles}} were initially built under the order with Jackson and Sharp, consisting of 11 Driving Motor vehicles and 11 Trailer vehicles, {{allowing for a}} total of four 4-car trains plus a number of spare vehicles. Unlike the City & South London Railway, which was London's only other deep-tube railway at the time, and which used electric locomotives and hauled coaches, these trains were electric multiple units, with the traction equipment and driving position located on the passenger carrying vehicles. Each Driving Motor vehicle was fitted with a 60 hp <b>series-wound</b> gearless <b>motor</b> per axle, with the current collected via third rail at 530v DC. The trains were fitted with Westinghouse compressed air brakes, although they did not have their own compressors; instead the air reservoirs had to be recharged using static compressors at Waterloo, which was done once the air pressure fell to [...] The crew for each train numbered six; the driver, a driver's assistant, a guard and three gatemen. These final crewmen manned the gated entrances that were located {{at the end of each}} car. There were no side doors, and the interiors were built in an open saloon rather than compartmented style.|$|R
5000|$|The {{traction}} motors by Siemens were <b>series-wound</b> [...] gearless <b>motors</b> on the axles. The trains ran in a formation of four cars, the two outer vehicles being motor coaches. The motor cars were constructed to allow an early form of multiple unit operation {{and the front}} car's controller was additionally {{able to control the}} rear car's motors. The two motors at each end were connected in series at starting, then reconnected in parallel (using open circuit transition) as the train accelerated in the well established (at that time) method. This required eight cables to be run the length of the train at roof level. A further cable making nine in all linked the collector shoes at opposite ends of the four-car set to avoid problems with the large gaps in the centrally mounted conductor rail.|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>series-wound</b> DC <b>motor</b> {{develops}} {{its highest}} torque at low speed, {{it is often}} used in traction applications such as electric locomotives, and trams. Another application is starter motors for petrol and small diesel engines. Series motors must never be used in applications where the drive can fail (such as belt drives). As the motor accelerates, the armature (and hence field) current reduces. The reduction in field causes the motor to speed up until it destroys itself. This {{can also be a}} problem with railway motors {{in the event of a}} loss of adhesion since, unless quickly brought under control, the motors can reach speeds far higher than they would do under normal circumstances. This can not only cause problems for the motors themselves and the gears, but due to the differential speed between the rails and the wheels it can also cause serious damage to the rails and wheel treads as they heat and cool rapidly. Field weakening is used in some electronic controls to increase the top speed of an electric vehicle. The simplest form uses a contactor and field-weakening resistor; the electronic control monitors the motor current and switches the field weakening resistor into circuit when the motor current reduces below a preset value (this will be when the motor is at its full design speed). Once the resistor is in circuit, the motor will increase speed above its normal speed at its rated voltage. When motor current increases, the control will disconnect the resistor and low speed torque is made available.|$|R
5000|$|The DC motor was the {{mainstay}} of electric traction drives on both electric and diesel-electric locomotives, street-cars/trams and diesel electric drilling rigs for many years. It consists of two parts, a rotating armature and fixed field windings surrounding the rotating armature mounted around a shaft. The fixed field windings consist of tightly wound coils of wire fitted inside the motor case. The armature is another set of coils wound round a central shaft and {{is connected to the}} field windings through [...] "brushes" [...] which are spring-loaded contacts pressing against an extension of the armature called the commutator. The commutator collects all the terminations of the armature coils and distributes them in a circular pattern to allow the correct sequence of current flow. When the armature and the field windings are connected in series, the whole motor is referred to as [...] "series-wound". A <b>series-wound</b> DC <b>motor</b> has a low resistance field and armature circuit. Because of this, when voltage is applied to it, the current is high due to Ohm's law. The advantage of high current is that the magnetic fields inside the motor are strong, producing high torque (turning force), so it is ideal for starting a train. The disadvantage is that the current flowing into the motor has to be limited, otherwise the supply could be overloaded or the motor and its cabling could be damaged. At best, the torque would exceed the adhesion and the driving wheels would slip. Traditionally, resistors were used to limit the initial current.|$|R
