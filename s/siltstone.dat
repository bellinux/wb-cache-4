5|$|The {{rock in the}} {{southern}} part of the watershed of West Creek is of the Trimmers Rock Formation. This consists of <b>siltstone</b> and shale and comes from the Devonian period. The northern part of the watershed has rock belonging to the Catskill Formation, which consists of sandstone and <b>siltstone</b> and also comes from the Devonian. The Huntley Mountain Formation can be found at the headwaters of the creek. This formation consists of sandstone and <b>siltstone</b> and comes from the Mississippian and Devonian periods.|$|E
5|$|Five major rock {{formations}} from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods {{are present in}} Upper Pine Bottom State Park and Cummings Township. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points in the township, is the early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, <b>siltstone,</b> and shale, as well as anthracite coal. Low-sulfur coal was once mined at three locations within the Pine Creek watershed, {{and there is a}} coal deposit between the headwaters of Upper Pine Bottom and Lower Pine Bottom Runs. Below this is the late Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation, which is formed with grayish-red shale, <b>siltstone,</b> sandstone, and conglomerate.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{has been}} worked in Cleveland {{on a small}} scale since before Roman times. The Cleveland Ironstone Formation {{consists}} of seams of marine ironstone alternating with shale and <b>siltstone,</b> of Lower Jurassic age.|$|E
50|$|The Floresta Formation is characterised by a lower {{sequence}} of shales and ochre to beige <b>siltstones</b> with alternating coquinas, while {{the upper part}} consists of <b>siltstones</b> with sandy beds.|$|R
50|$|The Spray River Formation {{consists}} of dolomitic and calcitic <b>siltstones,</b> silty dolomites and dolomitic limestones and dolomitic very fine sandstones (Sulphur Mountain Member) and dolomites, dolomitic <b>siltstones</b> and limestones and dolomitic and calcitic orthoquartzites and protoquartzites (Whitehorse Member).|$|R
40|$|Windblown dust is a {{significant}} source of sediment and organic matter for many basins, but its influence on ancient basins can be difficult to detect and quantify. We quantified the biomarker content, including n-alkanes, hopanes, and steranes of the Brushy Canyon Formation sandstones and <b>siltstones</b> to evaluate the significance of windblown dust in delivery of sediment and terrestrial organic matter to the Middle Permian Delaware Basin. Ramp <b>siltstones</b> of the basin have been interpreted as representing deposits of unconfined low-density turbidity currents or "aeolo-marine" sediments. We analyzed the organic contents of five samples of channel-confined turbiditic sandstones and <b>siltstones</b> and five samples of ramp <b>siltstones</b> outcropping in the Guadalupe Mountains National Park, West Texas, to estimate the relative proportions of terrestrial and marine organic matter in the two types of host rocks. The total organic carbon content of all samples varied from 0. 07 percent - 2. 04 percent. The abundance of high molecular weight n-alkanes (n-C 27 and greater) suggests that terrestrial organic matter was present in nearly all samples. Terrestrial organic matter input to the basin was characterized using a crossplot of pristane/n-C 17 versus phytane/n-C 18. Ramp <b>siltstones</b> showed ~ 10 -fold greater variation in terrestrial content than did turbiditic sandstones and <b>siltstones.</b> This observation is more consistent with the aeolo-marine interpretation of ramp <b>siltstones,</b> and suggests that terrestrial organic matter was delivered to the Delaware Basin by wind transport during deposition of the Brushy Canyon Formation...|$|R
5|$|Tremendous {{pressure}} {{caused the}} formation of the sedimentary rocks that are found in the park and in the Kitchen Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, <b>siltstone,</b> and conglomerates.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{have been}} found in Worlds End State Park, as the area was once a river delta on an ancient coastline. This coast was home to an ancient {{ancestor}} of the lungfish, which would burrow in the mud to survive dry spells. Fossils of these burrows have been discovered in the red <b>siltstone</b> formations in and near the park.|$|E
5|$|Four major rock {{formations}} {{are present in}} Worlds End State Park, all at least partly from the Carboniferous period. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points in the park, is the early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, <b>siltstone,</b> and shale, as well as anthracite coal. The Loyalsock gorge rim and {{the upper part of}} its walls are the late Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation, which is formed with grayish-red shale, <b>siltstone,</b> sandstone, and conglomerate. Below this is the Mississippian Burgoon Formation, which comprises buff-colored sandstone and conglomerate. The creek bed and base of the gorge walls are the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{rocks in}} this quarry are <b>siltstones</b> and pebbly {{sandstones}} of late Ordovician and early Silurian age, approximately 440 to 445 million years old. The rocks provide {{an insight into}} the environmental conditions at {{the boundary between the}} Ordovician and Silurian Periods. The oldest rocks in the quarry comprise late Ordovician <b>siltstones.</b> These contain fossilised remains of brachiopods, a marine sea-shell. After a break in deposition these <b>siltstones</b> are overlain by pebbly, rippled sandstones which range from very late Ordovician to Silurian in age." ...|$|R

5|$|Most of {{the bones}} {{collected}} were encased in <b>siltstone</b> nodules surrounded by fine sand and silt, with the rest lying in clay. The bones were disarticulated and scattered over a 5 x 2m (17 x 8ft) area, but most were not far from their natural positions. The position of some bones was disturbed by a bulldozer, and some were broken by mechanical equipment before they were collected. Preparing the specimen was difficult, due to the hardness of the <b>siltstone</b> matrix {{and the presence of}} siderite; acid preparation was attempted, but most of the matrix was removed mechanically. The skeleton consisted of partial skull bones; teeth; cervical, dorsal and caudal vertebrae; ribs; a sternum; coracoids; arm and hand bones; claws; hip bones, and leg bones. The original specimen number was BMNH R9951, but it was later re-catalogued as NHMUK VP R9951.|$|E
5|$|Next in the {{geologic}} {{column is}} the -thick Toroweap Formation (see 6c in figure 1). It consists {{of red and}} yellow sandstone and shaly gray limestone interbedded with gypsum. The formation was deposited in a warm, shallow sea as the shoreline transgressed (invaded) and regressed (retreated) over the land. The {{average age of the}} rock is about 273million years. In modern times it is a ledge- and slope-former that contains fossils of brachiopods, corals, and mollusks along with other animals and various terrestrial plants. The Toroweap is divided into the following three members: Seligman is a slope-forming yellowish to reddish sandstone and <b>siltstone.</b> Brady Canyon is a cliff-forming gray limestone with some chert. Wood Ranch is a slope-forming pale red and gray <b>siltstone</b> and dolomitic sandstone. An unconformity marks the top of this formation.|$|E
5|$|The main {{geological}} outcrops {{around the}} lake are mudstone, largely consisting of red <b>siltstone</b> resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of sandstone from the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside {{the course of the}} River Chew.|$|E
50|$|The Craven inliers {{are found}} {{to the north of}} the North Craven Fault. In these inliers, {{calcareous}} <b>siltstones</b> and muddy limestones of the Norber Formation are overlain by <b>siltstones</b> and mudstones of the Sowerthwaite Formation. The Dam House Bridge Tuff Member forms the basal part of the Sowerthwaite Formation.|$|R
50|$|The {{underlying}} lithology {{is dominated}} by Permian <b>siltstones</b> and sandstones.|$|R
5000|$|Middle: Brown fissile {{carbonaceous}} shales and <b>siltstones,</b> {{with thin}} lignite beds.|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} several less {{significant}} rock formations in Nescopeck Creek's watershed. These include the Spechty Kopf Formation, the Hamilton Formation, and the Catskill Formation. Little is understood about the Spechty Kopf Formation, but it occurs between the Catskill and Pocono Formations. The Catskill Formation is grayish-red shale, <b>siltstone,</b> and sandstone.|$|E
5|$|Underlying the Albany Pine Bush is a bedrock {{consisting}} of shale and <b>siltstone,</b> laid down 450 {{million years ago}} during the Middle Ordovician. The bedrock is covered by glaciolacustrine deposits which make up the sandy topsoils of the barrens.|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} major rock {{formations}} from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods {{are present in}} Quehanna Wild Area. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points on the plateau, is the Pennsylvanian Allegheny Formation, which has clay, coal, limestone, sandstone, and shale. Below this is the Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, <b>siltstone,</b> and shale, as well as anthracite coal, and which forms much of the Quehanna plateau. The next formations {{are found in the}} valleys and gorges which the creeks have eroded over time. The first of these is the Mississippian Pocono Formation, which is buff colored with shale, coal, and conglomerate inclusions; parts of this formation are also known as the Burgoon Sandstone. Below this is the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone. The lowest and oldest layer is the red shale and <b>siltstone</b> of the Catskill Formation.|$|E

30|$|The outer fan {{is located}} in the seaward {{extremity}} of the nearshore subaqueous fan and consists mainly of dark mudstones intercalated with <b>siltstones,</b> muddy <b>siltstones,</b> and locally thinly bedded fine-grained sandstones. Sedimentary structures mainly include wavy and horizontal beddings, reflecting a relatively lower flow regime and quiet environment. The corresponding SP curve is flat with low amplitudes.|$|R
2500|$|The Ponta Aguda Formation {{is up to}} [...] {{thick and}} {{consists}} of conglomerates, coarse to fine-grained sandstones interbedded with <b>siltstones</b> and shales. The dominant facies are coarse to fine-grained quartzitic sandstones. They range from reddish to grey, usually with calcite cements. Intercalated are reddish to light grey claystones and <b>siltstones.</b> They represent a fluvial to shallow marine environment.|$|R
5|$|Cryolophosaurus {{originally}} was {{collected during the}} 1990–91 austral summer on Mount Kirkpatrick in the Beardmore Glacier region of the Transantarctic Mountains. The discovery was made by Hammer, a professor at Augustana College, and his team. The fossils {{were found in the}} siliceous <b>siltstone</b> of the Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, and dated to the Pliensbachian stage of the early Jurassic. Cryolophosaurus was the second dinosaur, and first theropod, to be discovered in Antarctica. It was discovered after Antarctopelta, but named earlier.|$|E
5|$|In {{the very}} {{northern}} {{reaches of the}} Briar Creek watershed, the bedrock {{is made up of}} sandstone. South of the sandstone layer, there is a section of the watershed where the bedrock is mudstone. In {{the central part of the}} watershed, the bedrock is <b>siltstone.</b> In the southern part of the watershed, the bedrock is mostly shale, including the part of the watershed in Berwick, which it has bedrock of calcerous shale. A small area north of Berwick has limestone bedrock.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{layers of}} mudstone, {{conglomerate}} and <b>siltstone</b> interrupt the limestone horizontally. These layers are {{more resistant to}} attack by carbonic acid and they can therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos. Many of the more durable hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath.|$|E

30|$|One to four drill cores (with 25 -mm diameters) for rock-magnetic and paleomagnetic {{measurements}} were obtained at 200 horizons from <b>siltstones</b> or sandy <b>siltstones</b> (Figs.  2 and 3). These {{samples were collected}} using a portable drill and were oriented with a magnetic compass. Then, each paleomagnetic core was cut into a 2 -cm-long specimen for paleomagnetic and rock-magnetic measurements at Ibaraki University.|$|R
5|$|Part of the Kingston Peak resembles {{glacial till}} by being poorly sorted {{and other parts}} have large boulder-sized dropstones resting in a {{fine-grained}} matrix of sandstone and <b>siltstone.</b> Similar deposits are found over North America during the same period, some 700 to 800 mya. Geologists therefore hypothesize that the world {{at that time was}} affected by a very severe glaciation, perhaps the most severe in geologic history (see Snowball Earth). The youngest rocks in the Pahrump Group are from basaltic lava flows.|$|E
5|$|The limey oozes and mud {{were later}} lithified into the {{limestone}} and interbedded <b>siltstone</b> of the up-to-300foot (90m)-thick White Member of the Claron. This member erodes into white-colored monoliths {{that are found}} only at the highest elevations of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Fossils are rare in the White Member and consist mainly of freshwater snails and clams, indicating that the lakes supported little life. Most arches and natural bridges in the park, including the famous Natural Bridge, were carved from sandstone beds in the Claron.|$|E
5|$|The {{lithology}} of the Kirtlandian formations {{are made}} up of mostly a combination of coal beds. The Fruitland Formation consists entirely of them, and one fifth of all rocks of the Kirtland Formation are a coal. The other common rocks found in the Kirtland Formation are <b>siltstone,</b> mudstone, shale and most commonly, sandstone. The Bisti Bed of the Hunter Wash Member is made up completely of sandstone, which marks the border between the Kirtland and Fruitland formations.|$|E
50|$|The Group {{comprises}} a lower unit of coarse sandstones, <b>siltstones,</b> mudstone, and limestones {{with thin}} coals and ironstones {{known as the}} Lower Limestone Formation, an overlying sequence of similar rocks known as the Limestone Coal Formation, then an Upper Limestone Formation and at its top the sandstones of the Passage Formation. This last formation also includes fireclays, <b>siltstones,</b> mudstones, ironstones, coal and seatrocks.|$|R
