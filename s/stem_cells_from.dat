5|$|The {{approach}} in these sheep experiments involves irradiating a ram’s testes while placing <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> a second ram into the testes of the first, ram A. In the following weeks ram A produces semen the usual way, but {{is using the}} stem cells of ram B and therefore producing semen carrying the genetics of ram B rather than those of his own. Ram A therefore has effectively become a surrogate ram.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Magnusson {{established}} {{the use of}} <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> bone marrow with the first surgical debridement of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into fibrocartilage and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal hyaline cartilage and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this {{can be attributed to}} the decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.|$|E

40|$|Reciprocal {{interaction}} between oral ectodermal epithelial <b>cells</b> and mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (MSCs) -derived <b>from</b> the cranial neural crest starts the teeth development. The role of dental MSCs continues throughout life. The dental MSCs do not only {{play a role}} in tooth development but also in tooth homeostasis and repair. There are many kinds of dental MSCs, such as dental pulp <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> (DPSC), <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>from</b> apical papilla (SCAP), <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>from</b> exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED), periodontal ligament <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> (PDLSC) and <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>from</b> dental follicle (DFSC). Aligned with the proposed criteria by the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT), dental MSCs are adherent cells and like other MSCs, dental tissue MSCs are capable of giving rise to cell lineages such as osteo/odontogenic, adipogenic, and neurogenic. Various surface antigens of dental MSCs were reported, however, mostly typical antigens suggested by ISCT were fulfilled. Surface antigens from each dental MSCs (DPSC, SCAP, SHED, PDLSC and DFSC) are being described in the current report.

40|$|Background: In {{regenerative}} medicine, use {{of each of}} the mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> bone marrow, cord blood, and adipose tissue, {{has several}} cons and pros. Mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> cord blood have been considered the best source for precursor transplantation. Direct reprogramming of a somatic cell into induced pluripotent <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> by over-expression of 6 transcription factors Oct 4, Sox 2, Klf 4, lin 28, Nanog, and c-Myc has great potential for regenerative medicine, eliminating the ethical issues of embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and the rejection problems of using non-autologous cells. Objective: To compare reprogramming and pluripotent markers OCT 4, Sox- 2, c-Myc, Klf 4, Nanog, and lin 28 in mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> cord blood and induced pluripotent <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Methods: We analyzed the expression level of OCT 4, Sox- 2, c-Myc, Klf 4, Nanog and lin 28 genes in human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> cord blood and induced pluripotent <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> by cell culture and RT-PCR. Results: The expression level of pluripotent genes OCT 4 and Sox- 2, Nanog and lin 28 in mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> cord blood were significantly higher than those in induced pluripotent <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> In contrast to OCT- 4 A and Sox- 2, Nanog and lin 28, the expression level of oncogenic factors c-Myc and Klf 4 were significantly higher in induced pluripotent <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> than in mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> cord blood...|$|R
40|$|Human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> the {{umbilical}} cord (UC) are a favorable source for allogeneic cell therapy. Here, we successfully isolated the <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> three different compartments of the human UC, including perivascular <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> umbilical arteries (UCA-PSCs), perivascular <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> umbilical vein (UCV-PSCs), and mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> Wharton’s jelly (WJ-MSCs). These cells had the similar phenotype and differentiation potential toward adipocytes, osteoblasts, and neuron-like cells. However, UCA-PSCs and UCV-PSCs had more CD 146 + cells than WJ-MSCs (P< 0. 05). Tube formation assay in vitro showed {{the largest number of}} tube-like structures and branch points in UCA-PSCs among the three <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Additionally, the total tube length in UCA-PSCs and UCV-PSCs was significantly longer than in WJ-MSCs (P< 0. 01). Microarray, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analysis showed that UCA-PSCs had the highest expression of the Notch ligand Jagged 1 (JAG 1), which is crucial for blood vessel maturation. Knockdown of Jagged 1 significantly impaired the angiogenesis in UCA-PSCs. In summary, UCA-PSCs are promising cell populations for clinical use in ischemic diseases...|$|R
5000|$|Veterinary {{applications}} of <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> therapy {{as a means}} of tissue regeneration have been largely shaped by research that began with the use of adult-derived mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> to treat animals with injuries or defects affecting bone, cartilage, ligaments and/or tendons. [...] There are two main categories of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> used for treatments: allogeneic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> a genetically different donor within the same species and autologous mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> derived <b>from</b> the patient prior to use in various treatments.

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory is}} that stem cells remain undifferentiated due to environmental cues in their particular niche. Stem cells differentiate when they leave that niche or no longer receive those signals. Studies in Drosophila germarium have identified the signals decapentaplegic and adherens junctions that prevent germarium <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> differentiating.|$|E
25|$|Stem cell {{treatments}} {{may require}} immunosuppression {{because of a}} requirement for radiation before the transplant to remove the person's previous cells, or because the patient's immune system may target the stem cells.

McHugh was against using new lines of embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> in vitro fertilization but was in favor of the use of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> somatic <b>cell</b> nuclear transfer (SCNT). In SCNT, the nucleus of a cell is removed and replaced by another cell nucleus.

30|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche are {{specific}} anatomical region {{within a particular}} tissue which houses the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> population. This site regulates tissue regeneration, repair and maintenance and protects <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>from</b> depletion and the host tissue from over proliferation, thereby, maintaining tissue physiology in organisms. It may be mentioned here that an abnormal niche activity can result in healthcare disorders e.g. cancer. Understanding the ‘niche’ therefore, is important to improve regenerative medicine.|$|R
25|$|In practice, {{stem cells}} are {{identified}} by whether they can regenerate tissue. For example, the defining test for bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) {{is the ability to}} transplant the cells and save an individual without HSCs. This demonstrates that the cells can produce new blood cells over a long term. It should also be possible to isolate <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.|$|E
25|$|Peripheral blood {{stem cells}} are now the most common source of stem cells for HSCT. They are {{collected}} from the blood through {{a process known as}} apheresis. The donor's blood is withdrawn through a sterile needle in one arm and passed through a machine that removes white blood cells. The red blood cells are returned to the donor. The peripheral stem cell yield is boosted with daily subcutaneous injections of Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, serving to mobilize <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> the donor's bone marrow into the peripheral circulation.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there was}} initial {{evidence}} of mesencephalic dopamine-producing cell transplants being beneficial, the best constructed studies {{up to date}} indicate that cell transplants have no effect.

Nevertheless, use of fetal stem cells is controversial. Some have proposed that such controversy may be overcome with the use of induced pluripotent <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> adults.|$|E

25|$|Most {{attempts}} at genetic repair have traditionally involved {{the use of}} a retrovirus to insert a new gene into a random position on a chromosome. But by attaching zinc fingers (which determine where transcription factors bind) to endonucleases (which break DNA strands), homologous recombination can be induced to correct and replace defective (or undesired) DNA sequences. The first applications of this technology are to isolate <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> the bone marrow of patients having blood disease mutations, to correct those mutations in laboratory dishes using zinc finger endonucleases and to transplant the stem cells back into the patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{cells in}} which all these DNA {{alterations}} accumulate are difficult to trace, but two recent lines of evidence suggest that normal stem cells may be the cells of origin in cancers. First, there exists a highly positive correlation (Spearman’s rho = 0.81; P < 3.5 × 10−8) between {{the risk of developing}} cancer in a tissue and the number of normal stem cell divisions taking place in that same tissue. The correlation applied to 31 cancer types and extended across five orders of magnitude. This correlation means that if the normal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> a tissue divide once, the cancer risk in that tissue is approximately 1X. If they divide 1,000 times, the cancer risk is 1,000X. And if the normal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> a tissue divide 100,000 times, the cancer risk in that tissue is approximately 100,000X. This strongly suggests that the main reason we have cancer is that our normal stem cells divide, which implies that cancer originates in normal stem cells. Second, statistics show that most human cancers are diagnosed in aged people. A possible explanation is that cancers occur because cells accumulate damage through time. DNA is the only cellular component that can accumulate damage over the entire course of a life, and stem cells are the only cells that can transmit DNA from the zygote to cells late in life. Other cells cannot keep DNA from the beginning of life until a possible cancer occurs. This implies that most cancers arise from normal stem cells.|$|E
