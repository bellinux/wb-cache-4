5|$|There was no autopsy, and {{the cause}} of Lambert's death is unknown. While many sources say that he died of a fatty {{degeneration}} of the heart or of stress on his heart caused by his bulk, his behaviour in the period leading to his death does not match that of someone suffering from cardiac insufficiency; witnesses agree that on the morning of his death he appeared well, before he became <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> and collapsed. Bondeson(2006) speculates that the most consistent explanation of his death, given his symptoms and medical history, is that he had a sudden pulmonary embolism.|$|E

Frustrated with the experience, Edwards sailed back to New York the next year {{with the intention of}} returning to acting, but poor health kept him from full enjoyment of the limelight. In March, Edwards appeared as Holofernes in Love's Labour's Lost at Augustin Daly's Daly Theatre, but was often <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> and unable {{to keep pace with the}} run—his part was given to a young Tyrone Power who also covered Edwards' old role of Sir Oliver Surface for Daly's road show of The School for Scandal.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} {{there may be}} an {{asymptomatic}} phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged, in some cases blood sugar levels will rise (hyperglycemia) and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally intravascular hemolysis causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria which can lead to renal toxicity or renal failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin, which is a form of hemoglobin that can not carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> and cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle fasciculations and seizures, and mydriasis progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.|$|E

In a brief address to liturgists on the anniversary of Musicam Sacram, Francis mentions eight times the importance of the peoples’ active participation in song. In an address to charismatics he reemphasizes this: “You are able to shout out when your team scores a goal, and you cannot sing the Lord’s praises and leave behind your composure a little to sing”. As regards his own singing at Mass, he has pointed out that since he had the upper portion of his right lung removed, he is too <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E

25|$|Tobacco smoking {{increases}} the risk of developing panic disorder with or without agoraphobia and panic attacks; smoking started in adolescence or early adulthood particularly increases this risk of developing panic disorder. While the mechanism of how smoking increases panic attacks is not fully understood, a few hypotheses have been derived. Smoking cigarettes may lead to panic attacks by causing changes in respiratory function (e.g. feeling <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath).</b> These respiratory changes in turn can lead to the formation of panic attacks, as respiratory symptoms are a prominent feature of panic. Respiratory abnormalities have been found in children with high levels of anxiety, which suggests that a person with these difficulties may be susceptible to panic attacks, and thus more likely to subsequently develop panic disorder. Nicotine, a stimulant, could contribute to panic attacks. However, nicotine withdrawal may also cause significant anxiety which could contribute to panic attacks.|$|E
25|$|Haig's {{appointment}} as Commander-in-Chief BEF was announced on 10 December and almost simultaneously Robertson became Chief of the Imperial General Staff in London, reporting {{directly to the}} Cabinet {{rather than to the}} War Secretary. Haig and Robertson hoped that this would be {{the start of a new}} and more professional management of the war. Monro was promoted to GOC First Army in Haig's place, not Rawlinson whom Haig would have preferred and for reasons of seniority Haig was forced to accept the weak-willed Launcelot Kiggell, not Butler as chief of staff BEF in succession to Robertson. Haig and French, who seemed ill and <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> had a final handover meeting (18 December, the day before the formal change of command), at which Haig agreed that Churchill—recently resigned from the Cabinet and vetoed from command of a brigade—should be given command of a battalion.|$|E

On September 1, outside Thunder Bay, {{he was forced to}} stop briefly after he suffered an intense coughing fit and experienced pains in his chest. Unsure what to do, he resumed running as the crowds along the highway shouted out their encouragement. A few miles later, <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> and with continued chest pain, he asked Alward to drive him to a hospital. He feared immediately that he had run his last kilometer.

500|$|Smoking {{cigarettes}} {{has become}} synonymous with Dot, and Brown {{has suggested that the}} habit is [...] "intrinsic" [...] to the character. Following the 2007 England smoking ban, it was reported in the Daily Mail that the BBC were refusing to prohibit the character from smoking on-screen despite the act being banned in workplaces, as they have [...] "to portray real life– and people smoke". Dot's smoking was criticised by private healthcare company Bupa in 2008, when they rated her television's most unhealthy character. They suggest that, in order to spread a public message, Dot should appear breathless, not with [...] "implausibly good health". They added, [...] "Though Dot Cotton has a smoker's voice– deeper than you might expect, she {{does not seem to be}} <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> or wheezy" [...] and that viewers would be influenced by this. However, Dot's smoking has been described by broadcasting watchdogs Ofcom as [...] "justified in the context of the programme as a representation of an East End character" [...] and they therefore stipulate that enforcement of broadcast smoking-sanctions would be unlikely on EastEnders.|$|E
500|$|Davis toured relentlessly for {{two years}} while tolerating intense {{physical}} pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from sickle-cell anaemia, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck, and osteoporosis in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on self-medicating with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. [...] "He was like the general looking at the fort {{and they had a}} moat {{and we were going to}} get in that fort", Henderson later said. [...] "That was the attitude of the band.
