5|$|With the {{military}} reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, designed to combat a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> due to wars against Jugurtha, the different classes of units were disbanded entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Now soldiers would join as a career, {{rather than as}} service to the city, and would all be equipped as heavy infantry with the same, state purchased equipment.|$|E
5|$|Although disbanded in 1919 {{following}} {{the end of}} hostilities, it was re-raised in 1921 in the Citizens Force (later known as the Militia) as a part-time infantry battalion based in Victoria. However, due to lack of funding {{following the}} Great Depression and a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> following the suspension of the compulsory training scheme in 1929, the battalion was amalgamated with the 38th Battalion as the 7th/38th Battalion, although it was delinked again in 1936 when the Army was expanded due to rising tensions in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} {{formation}} of the 3rd Division, Barrowclough had been aware that New Zealand's ability to keep it and the 2nd New Zealand Division in the field was limited. However, so long as the Japanese posed a threat to New Zealand's security, there was still political will for the 3rd Division to be maintained. With the Japanese no longer a meaningful concern to the country, New Zealand's increasing <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> resulted in the disbandment of the 3rd Division. As well as providing reinforcements for the 2nd New Zealand Division, at the time engaged in fighting in Italy, it allowed men to return to vital industries in New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|Ground {{was broken}} at Eleventh and Oak Streets in 1917, {{but due to}} <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> and {{materials}} during the First World War, construction was delayed and was not completed until 1920. The new building served as Southwestern Bell's general headquarters for only {{a year before the}} company moved its main office to St. Louis. Thereafter the tower served as the headquarters of Southwestern Bell's operations in Missouri.|$|R
5000|$|British {{military}} {{plans for}} 1779 were large in ambition, but were ultimately hampered, {{in the opinion}} of their North American commander in chief, Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton, by <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower,</b> and delays in the arrival <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> that was promised for the campaign. Clinton sought to force Washington to weaken the Continental Army camp at Middlebrook in northern New Jersey, after which he would march in force out of New York and capture it. [...] This, Clinton believed, would threaten Washington's supply lines, drawing him out of the highlands on the Hudson River into more favorable terrain for a general engagement.|$|R
50|$|The 105th and 107th Infantry Divisions were {{intended}} to be negro divisions of the Army of the United States; however, due to a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> available <b>manpower,</b> their activations were canceled in 1942.|$|R
5|$|Velites {{were first}} used, and created, at {{the siege of}} Capua in 211 BC, and were made up of {{citizens}} who would normally be too poor to join the hastati but were called up due a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower.</b> They were trained to ride on horseback with the equites and jump down at a given signal to fling javelins at the enemy. After the siege, they were adopted into the legions as a force of irregular light infantry for ambushing and harassing the enemy with javelins before the battle began in earnest.|$|E
5|$|With {{the formal}} {{military}} reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, intended to combat a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> from wars against Jugurtha in Africa and Germanic tribes to the north, the different classes of units were disbanded entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Instead, it was decreed that soldiers {{would join the}} legion as a career, rather than as service to the city, and would all be equipped as medium infantry with the same state-purchased equipment. Auxiliaries, local irregular troops, would fulfill other roles, serving as archers, skirmishers and cavalry.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, the British Army {{suffered}} a severe <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower.</b> In {{an effort to}} downsize the army and consolidate as many men within as few formations as possible to maintain fighting strength and efficiency, the War Office began disbanding divisions, including the 80th Infantry (Reserve) Division. As part of this restructure, {{the decision was made}} to retain division numbers familiar to the British public. On 1 September 1944, the 38th Division was recreated as the 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division to replace the 80th as Western Command's training formation. The new 38th Division was commanded by Major-General Lionel Howard Cox, who had previously commanded the 80th Division. At this point, the divisional insignia was worn only by the permanent members of the division.|$|E
50|$|Collectivization of the {{agricultural}} sector under the Heng Samrin regime included the formation of solidarity groups. As small aggregates {{of people living in}} the same locality, known to one another, and able to a certain extent to profit collectively from their work, they were an improvement over the dehumanized, forced-labor camps and communal life of the Pol Pot era. The organization of individuals and families into solidarity groups also made sense in the environment of resource-poor, post-war Cambodia. People working together in this way were able to offset somewhat the <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower,</b> draft animals, and farm implements.|$|R
50|$|Army Group Vistula {{consisted}} of two armies: the 3rd Panzer Army led by General Hasso von Manteuffel and the 9th Army led by General Theodor Busse. Heinrici was tasked with preventing a Soviet attack across the Oder River amid <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> and material. Only the terrain itself favoured Heinrici; he dug the 9th Army into three defensive lines atop Seelow Heights, overlooking the sandy, swampy banks of the Oder. Manteuffel's 3rd Panzer Army, which had fewer panzers than the 9th, was similarly positioned in the north to delay a possible flanking strike by Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky's 2nd Byelorussian Front.|$|R
50|$|The forts {{were cited}} {{in advance of}} the city walls to keep an enemy out of {{artillery}} range of the capital. As a result <b>of</b> <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> money, <b>manpower</b> and materièl, some of the forts' armament and personnel were drawn from the Navy.|$|R
5|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{demands of}} the Punic Wars, {{in addition to a}} <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower,</b> exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, {{at least in the short}} term. In 217 BC, near the beginning of the Second Punic War, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners. During the 2nd century BC, Roman territory saw an overall decline in population, partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes. As a result, the Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state, which it did not have to do in the past.|$|E
5|$|After the {{division}} arrived in England, Ernest Down was posted to India {{to oversee the}} formation of the 44th Indian Airborne Division, and was replaced by Major General Roy Urquhart. In September 1944, for Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands, the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade was attached to {{the division}}. Following Market Garden, fewer than 2,200 men from the 10,000 that were sent to the Netherlands returned to the British lines. Having suffered such severe casualties, the 4th Parachute Brigade was disbanded, with its surviving men being posted to the 1st Parachute Brigade. The division then went through a period of reorganisation, but had still not fully recovered {{by the end of the}} war, due to the acute <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> throughout the British Army in 1944-1945. Still under strength in May 1945, it was sent to Norway to disarm the German army of occupation; returning to Britain in November 1945 where the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Calais, factors outside of Edward's control forced him to wind down the war effort. In 1348, the Black Death struck England with full force, killing a third {{or more of the}} country's population. This loss of {{manpower}} led to a shortage of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in wages. The great landowners struggled with the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> and the resulting inflation in labour cost. To curb the rise in wages, the king and parliament responded with the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349, followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempts to regulate wages could not succeed in the long run, but in the short term they were enforced with great vigour. All in all, the plague did not lead to a full-scale breakdown of government and society, and recovery was remarkably swift. This was to a large extent thanks to the competent leadership of royal administrators such as Treasurer William Edington and Chief Justice William de Shareshull.|$|E

50|$|After the Korean War, the {{operational}} squadron aircraft maintenance units were consolidated into an Organizational Maintenance Squadron (OMS) under the DCM. This {{was the first}} time that combat squadrons had no organic maintenance capability. Budget cuts in the 1950s and the resulting <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> and spare parts made consolidated maintenance very attractive. During the Vietnam War, Tactical Air Command transferred flightline maintenance personnel to the deploying squadrons to Southeast Asia. Squadrons transferred to Pacific Air Forces retained this arrangement, however in 1972 driven by budgetary considerations and the Vietnam drawdown, HQ USAF withdrew its approval for TAC’s structural deviation and forced TAC to revert to the consolidated maintenance concept.|$|R

5|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{demands of}} the Punic Wars, {{in addition to a}} <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower,</b> exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, {{at least in the short}} term. In 217BC, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners when slaves were pressed into naval service; around 213BC, the property requirement was reduced from 11,000 to 4,000 asses. Since the Romans are unlikely to have preferred to employ slaves over poor citizens in their armies, it must be assumed that, at this point, the proletarii of the poorest citizens must also have been pressed into service despite their lack of legal qualification. By 123BC, the financial requirement for military service was slashed again from 4,000 asses to just 1,500 asses. By this time, therefore, it is clear that many of the property-less former proletarii had been nominally admitted into the adsidui.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} {{sector of the}} English economy, still by far the largest, was transformed by the Black Death. With the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> after the Black Death, wages for agricultural labourers rapidly increased and continued to then grow steadily throughout the 15th century. As their incomes increased, labourers' living conditions and diet improved steadily. A trend for labourers to eat less barley and more wheat and rye, and to replace bread in their diet with more meat, had been apparent since before the Black Death, but intensified during this later period. Nonetheless, England's much smaller population needed less food {{and the demand for}} agricultural products fell. The position of the larger landowners became increasingly difficult. Revenues from demesne lands were diminishing as demand remained low and wage costs increased; nobles were also finding it more difficult to raise revenue from their local courts, fines and privileges in the years after the Peasants Revolt of 1381. Despite attempts to increase money rents, {{by the end of the}} 14th century the rents paid from peasant lands were also declining, with revenues falling as much as 55% between the 1380s and 1420s.|$|E
5|$|The first glider {{casualties}} {{had occurred}} on take off, when two aircraft towing Waco gliders crashed. While on route, {{one of the}} gliders was released early by its towing aircraft, and crashed into the sea. When they did arrive over Sicily, {{the element of surprise}} was gone, and four gliders were shot down by the coastal anti-aircraft batteries. By the time the gliders arrived at their landing zones, two hours had lapsed since the parachute landings had started. One glider pilot later commented that they did not need the pathfinders, as the tracer and lights from explosions were brighter than any of the landing markers. Of the surviving glider force, only four gliders managed to land relatively unscathed, all the others being caught by the Fallschirmjäger machine gun fire and destroyed on their approach. The four intact gliders had been carrying three of the anti-tank guns, which were now included in the bridge's defences. Including the men from the gliders, the 1st Parachute Brigade had 295men at the bridge. <b>Shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> was not their only problem; their only support weapons were the anti-tank guns, two 3-inch mortars and a Vickers machine gun.|$|E

[...] She was {{then transferred to}} Simon's Town, South Africa in 1947, to form the South Atlantic Reserve Force. The ship was purchased by the South African Navy in 1950 and renamed HMSAS Jan van Riebeeck. She was placed in reserve in 1953 and continuing <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> kept the ship in reserve {{for most of the}} rest of her career even though she was converted into a fast anti-submarine frigate in 1964–66. Jan van Riebeeck was converted to serve as a training ship in 1971–72 and remained in that role until she was decommissioned in 1975. The ship was sunk as a target in 1980.|$|R
5|$|For a long time, the Megami Tensei {{franchise}} was not {{exported to}} western territories despite {{there being a}} recognized market. The original reasons were the heavy religious themes and symbols used, which were considered taboo in western game markets, and Nintendo's strict content guidelines for overseas releases. Later, many of these early works were prevented from coming overseas due to their age, which would have put them at a disadvantage in the modern gaming market. Early entries on the PlayStation were also blocked by Sony of America's then-current approval policies. The first title in the franchise to be localized was Jack Bros.; the first role-playing game in the franchise to receive an overseas release was the first Persona game. This was done to give Atlus' North American branch a flagship RPG franchise that could compete {{with the likes of}} Final Fantasy, Suikoden and Breath of Fire. According to Okada, the naming of creatures and enemies was adjusted from the main series and original Japanese release of Persona to make it more acceptable for an overseas audience. Though it managed to establish the franchise overseas, the localization was a taxing task due to a small staff and the need to change multiple aspects to suit a North American audience, including removing references to Japanese culture and changing one character from Japanese to African-American. The first Persona 2 title, Innocent Sin, needed to be passed over due to <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> and the fact that development was focused on the second title, Eternal Punishment.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the South's <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manpower,</b> until 1865, most Southern leaders opposed arming slaves as soldiers. However, a few Confederates {{discussed}} arming slaves. Finally in early 1865 General Robert E. Lee said black soldiers were essential, and legislation was passed. The first black units were in training {{when the war ended}} in April.|$|E
