Starting in August 1790, British and Prussian diplomats in Russia started pressuring the Russians to begin negotiations with the Ottomans, with no luck.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} divide over SB 100 was not partisan <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was regional, {{as members}} of both the Republican and Democratic parties fell {{on each side of}} the issue. Within the populous Willamette Valley, support for the measure was high, with legislators voting by a margin of 5-to-1 in favor of the bill. Outside of the 9 valley counties, conservative legislators opposed passage of SB 100 by a ratio of more than 2-to-1. The populous valley's representation proved decisive, however, and on May 29, 1973, Governor McCall signed the bill into law.|$|E

25|$|With {{the end of}} the Western Roman Empire {{and with}} urban centres in decline, {{literacy}} and learning decreased in the West. This continued a pattern that had been underway since the 3rd century. Much learning under the Roman Empire was in Greek, and with the re-emergence of the wall between east and west, little eastern learning continued in the west. Much of the Greek literary corpus remained in Greek, and few in the west could speak or read Greek. Due to the demographic displacement that accompanied {{the end of the}} western Roman Empire, by this point most western Europeans were descendants of non-literate barbarians rather than literate Romans. In this sense, education wasn't lost <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> had yet to be acquired.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Roland {{discontinued}} the 808 in 1983, {{it had become}} common on the used market, often selling for under $100. Its ease of use, affordability, and idiosyncratic sound earned it a cult following among underground musicians and producers, {{and it became a}} cornerstone of the developing electronic and hip hop genres. In 1982, Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force released their track [...] "Planet Rock", which made extensive use of the 808 to create [...] "strange, futuristic percussion that became hugely popular on dancefloors". The track informed the development of electronic and hip hop music and subgenres including Miami bass and Detroit techno, and popularized the 808 as a [...] "fundamental element of futuristic sound". According to Slate, [...] "Planet Rock" [...] "didn't so much put the 808 on the map <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> reoriented an entire world of post-disco dance music around it".|$|E

She was {{concerned}} that Mercedes' plot may lead towards the character becoming unlikeable, and criticized Holly's sudden departure. Though she enjoyed Sunshine's return, seeing Kurt and Blaine at McKinley and Mercedes' solo, she noted [...] "all of those moments were fleeting and only contributed to the uneven feel of the show." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "quirky mixed bag, packed with amusing bits and pieces but very little emotional (or musical) oomph.". Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club graded the episode [...] "C". He suggested that its purpose was to address two criticisms of the show: the under-use of its supporting cast members, and the [...] "maniacal behavior" [...] of Sue. McNutt wrote, [...] "not only was the execution on these endeavors spotty at best and outright obnoxious at worst, but the growing futility of continuity in this series renders any and all developments wholly temporary. This episode was not {{a step in the}} right direction <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was an escalator to nowhere: A week from now, the chances of any of this resonating in the show itself is slim to none." [...] He felt that Mercedes has become a prop, rather than a character, and criticized the episode for attributing her blame for the marginalization the writers have subjected her to.|$|E
2500|$|Aristotle {{taught that}} virtue {{has to do}} with the proper {{function}} (ergon) of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē (normally translated as soul) in accordance with reason (logos). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, eudaimonia, generally translated as [...] "happiness" [...] or sometimes [...] "well being". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (ēthikē aretē), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).|$|E
2500|$|Burnham {{looked around}} the world for {{indications}} of the new form of society which was emerging to replace historic capitalism and saw certain commonalities between the economic formations of Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and America under Franklin D. Roosevelt and his [...] "New Deal." [...] Burnham argued that over a comparatively short period, which he dated from the first world war, a new society had emerged in which a [...] "social group or class" [...] which Burnham called [...] "managers" [...] had engaged in a [...] "drive for social dominance, for power and privilege, for the position of ruling class." [...] For at least a decade previous to Burnham's book, the idea of a [...] "separation of ownership and control" [...] of the modern corporation had been part of American economic thought, with Burnham citing The Modern Corporation and Private Property by Berle and Means as an important exposition. Burnham expanded upon this concept, arguing that whether ownership was corporate and private or statist and governmental, the essential demarcation between the ruling elite (executives and managers on the one hand, bureaucrats and functionaries on the other) and the mass of society was not ownership <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was control of the means of production.|$|E

2500|$|However, the investigations, bizarre as {{they may}} seem, did have a sound {{scientific}} basis since Rivers especially {{was looking at the}} protopathic and epicritic from an evolutionary perspective. From this standpoint it is intensely {{interesting to note that the}} male anatomy maintains one area which is [...] "unevolved" [...] in <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is [...] "associated with a more primitive form of sensibility". Using this information about the protopathic areas of the human body, Rivers and Head then began to explore elements of man's psyche. One way in which they did this was to examine the [...] "pilomoter reflex" [...] (the erection of hairs). Head and Rivers noted that the thrill evoked by aesthetic pleasure is [...] "accompanied by the erection of hairs" [...] and they noted that this reaction was no greater in the area of skin with protopathic sensibility than it was in the area of the more evolved epicritic, making it a purely psychologically based phenomena. As Langham puts it: [...] "The image of a man reading a poem to evoke aesthetic pleasure while a close friend meticulously studies the erection of his hairs may seem ludicrous. However, it provides a neat encapsulation of Rivers's desire to subject possibly protopathic phenomena to the discipline of rigorous investigation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{response}} to some early negative reactions to the actress' performance, Jon Lachonis noted {{in a review of}} the first season's seventh episode that [...] "Anna Torv, whose chill portrayal of FBI agent and Pattern investigator Olivia Dunham has come under fire for being too wooden, seems to have reinvented her character to answer the critics. The good news is, Anna's new and more animated Olivia isn't really a departure <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is a character who seems to have had a catharsis. She is comfortable in her skin now, and the stillness is pulled back in favor of more humanity. Of course, it is helpful that she reunites with an old beau in this episode - if there is one thing Fringe is totally lacking it is sexual tension." [...] Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman defended Torv's early Fringe work in a 2011 interview, explaining the character was designed to be [...] "bland, because of her conditioning as a child and everything she's been through. Now, one can argue that maybe that wasn't the best way for us to introduce the main character, but there was a purpose. So Anna had to listen to all these people saying 'She's really doing nothing,' when really it was our issue. We didn't write anything for her because... well, now you know why. But at the time, people were like, 'Wow, this girl really is not much,' which is so not true. Anna was just so professional, and so great. She did it with excellence, and now she's really getting the chance to show people, 'Hey, I'm a really hard worker and a terrific actor.' We're so thankful that people can start to see her for who she really is. Midway through the second season, Sarah Stegall from SFScope believed Torv [...] "had the most progress and the most satisfying development" [...] of all the main actors, stating she [...] "is now carrying this role with grace and strength". Stegall partly attributed the growth of the actor and character to her recovery early in the second season, the introduction of a sister and niece, the removal of John Scott from her storyline, and the [...] "delicate, reserved flirtation" [...] with Peter.|$|E
