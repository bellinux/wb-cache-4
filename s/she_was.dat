5|$|Danton was a semi-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy and {{the lead}} ship of her class. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> a technological leap in battleship development for the French Navy, as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the first ship in the fleet with turbine engines. However, like all battleships of her type, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> completed after the Royal Navy battleship , and as such <b>she</b> <b>was</b> outclassed before <b>she</b> <b>was</b> even commissioned.|$|E
5|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{badly damaged}} by a German air attack on 11 March, but {{was able to}} {{continue}} under her own power. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> damaged again in Novorossiysk by I.
