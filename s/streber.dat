50|$|The {{majority}} of the genre called melodic hardcore influenced later skate punk/pop punk into what it became in the 1990s. This also created a Swedish subgenre called trallpunk, a style of music with catchy melodies, fast drum speed and narrative texts, often left-wing political lyrics, and unlike the faster hardcore punk, straight to the point lyrics. Notable trallpunk bands include De lyckliga kompisarna, <b>Strebers</b> and Radioaktiva räker.|$|R

50|$|Trallpunk (Swedish; roughly {{translates}} to 'melodious punk') is a subgenre of punk music specially developed in Sweden.

During the 1990s, trallpunk saw increased popularity, particularly due to the club Kafé 44 in Stockholm and the band De Lyckliga Kompisarna (The Happy Friends).|$|R
5000|$|Thus Benjamin {{activity}} as a publisher mirrored the Catholic revival in Germany in the 19th century. He selected the themes for literary treatment. He personally discovered the majority. In no undertaking did he allow material gain {{to be the}} deciding factor; even in times of crisis-and of such he encountered more than one, beginning with the Baden uprising of 1848, right through the wars which raged between 1859 and 1871, down to the Kulturkampf which crippled the resources of both clergy and people-the end in view alone determined his decision. Thoroughly alive to his grave responsibility as a publisher, he devoted extraordinary care to the training of capable and conscientious assistants. His partner, Franz Joseph Hutter (b. at Ravensburg, 25 November 1840) issued {{from the ranks of}} these [...] "pupils".

New branches were established to open a wider market than the older establishments at Freiburg and Strasburg afforded. In 1873 were founded the St. Louis (U. S.

In 1863 Herder married Emilie <b>Streber,</b> the accomplished daughter of Franz Seraph <b>Streber,</b> professor at the Munich University, and celebrated as a numismatist.

50|$|<b>Streber</b> {{was born}} in Deutenkofen, Lower Bavaria. The nephew of Franz Ignaz von <b>Streber,</b> he first studied {{theology}} and philosophy, then archæology and numismatics, and in 1830 wrote as his dissertation for obtaining the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Erlangen a paper on the genealogy of the Burgraves of Nuremberg. In 1854 he {{became a member of}} the Academy of Munich. In 1835 he was made professor of archæology at the University of Munich, of which he was twice rector. In 1827 he was made clerk, in 1830 assistant, and in 1841 curator of the royal cabinet of coins. He also worked on the numismatic collection of Vienna and prepared a critical catalogue of 18,000 Greek coins and a numismatico-iconographic lexicon with drawings of about 6000 Greek coins belonging to the Viennese and Munich collections.|$|E
5000|$|Thus Benjamin Herder's {{activity}} as a publisher {{was always a}} faithful mirror of the Catholic revival in Germany in the nineteenth century, and furthermore a powerful lever exerted in favour of the Catholic cause. This was so much the more creditable, since Herder was not merely the agent, but also in general the originator of his enterprises. Possessing a clear and profound knowledge {{of the needs of}} Catholic literature, it was usually he who selected the themes for literary treatment. When he once recognized a project to be right, he clung to it tenaciously until conditions proved favourable, although decades elapsed before his scheme could be realized. Almost always on the watch for competent collaborators, he discovered the majority by his own exertions, personal acquaintance usually developing into lifelong friendship. In no undertaking did he allow material gain to be the deciding factor; even in times of crisis-and of such he encountered more than one, beginning with the Baden uprising of 1848, right through the wars which raged between 1859 and 1871, down to the dreary years of the Kulturkampf which crippled the resources of both clergy and people-the end in view alone determined his decision.

Further papers on Celtic, Greek, and medieval coins, also on archæology, mythology, and the history of art, appeared chiefly in the publications of the Munich Academy. He also drew up a Promemoria that is preserved among the records of the royal cabinet of coins, as to the expenses and the plan of a monumental work covering the entire field of Greek numismatics that was to take the place of the old work by Eckhel and be about one-half larger. <b>Streber</b> was also prominent in politics as a strong supporter of the ecclesiastico-conservative party.

These sisters established the first parish school at St. Martin of Tours in 1858 and shortly thereafter founded the Ursuline Academy for girls one block away. In 1863 the Xaverian Brothers began a school for boys at St. Martin of Tours, their first establishment in the city. In 1888, the Brothers of Mary took over the instruction of the boys in a new building that now serves as the rectory and parish offices. These brothers continued teaching at the parish until 1917, when the Ursuline sisters took over all instruction at the parish school.|$|E

We also compare {{the results of the}} benthic main channel survey witha shoreline electrofishing (SE) data set. Altogether 33 species were collected offshore during the 175 trawling paths (500 m long each). Both sample based and individual based rarefaction showed that nighttime SE detected significantly more species with increasing sampling effort than day time trawling ofoffshore areas. However, offshore surveys detected sterlet Acipenser ruthenus, which could not be detectedby SE, even using extreme high sampling effort. Offshore trawling also proved the common occurrenceand high abundance of the strictly protected endemic Danube <b>streber</b> Zingel <b>streber</b> in the river, whichproved to be extremely rare in SE catches. The EBFT caught larger/older individuals of many species thanSE, and indicated diverse size/age structure for many species offshore. Our survey revealed that offshoreareas are intensively used by a variety of species, which occur relatively even, but with variable abundancein the Danube River.
