5|$|The press did {{not cover}} the battle at first, and one Ohio paper misinterpreted Harrison's {{dispatch}} to Eustis to {{mean he was}} defeated. By December, as most major American papers carried <b>stories</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battle, public outrage over the Shawnee attack grew. At a time of high tensions with the United Kingdom, many Americans blamed the British for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms. In response, Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in American domestic affairs. A few months later, on June 18, 1812, the U.S. government declared war against United Kingdom. Shortly thereafter, Harrison left Vincennes to seek a military appointment.|$|E
5|$|Newsweek {{verbally}} accepted Hensmann's {{offer and}} he in turn informed Murdoch, {{giving him the}} option to raise his bid. Murdoch was furious, having considered the handshake agreement in Zürich final. On 15 April 1983 Murdoch, with Mark Edmiston, the president of Newsweek, met Schulte-Hillen, who, unexpectedly and without explanation, went back on all the previous verbal—and therefore, to his mind, non-binding—agreements and told them the price was now $4.25million. Murdoch and Edmiston refused to accede to the new price and both left. The managers of Stern, with no publishing partners, backtracked on their statements {{and came to a}} second deal with Murdoch, who drove the price down, paying $800,000 for the US rights, and $400,000 for the British and Australian rights. Further deals were done in France with Paris Match for $400,000; in Spain with Grupo Zeta for $150,000; in the Netherlands for $125,000; in Norway for $50,000; and in Italy with Panorama for $50,000. Newsweek did not enter into a deal and instead based their subsequent <b>stories</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> copies of the diaries they had seen during the negotiation period.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the plant}} {{consisted}} of the company offices and the large Manufacturing Building. The Mason house, which would become the company office was originally constructed in 1861. It is a two-story brick Italianate style house that was converted {{to be used as}} an office building and significantly modified throughout the years. The 1929 addition added a wing that connected it to the metal products building which was built that year. In 1942, a two-story front addition was added and another addition to the west was added around 1950. These additions also resulted in the removal of the cupola, brick chimneys, front entry, and veranda. The Manufacturing building, constructed from 1912 to 1913, is three stories high on the river side and two <b>stories</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east. It is divided into 31 bays with pilasters. At each end of the building are stairs and elevator towers. The structural remains of the original glass house survive as a sub-basement in a one-story extension {{at the south end of}} the building.|$|E

5|$|While {{plans were}} {{under way to}} secure funding for the {{restoration}} of the carousel, efforts were made to find some missing animals. By studying old photographs of the carousel, it was determined there had been three deer or stags which had not been found in the park district storage building. No one at the park district knew of their whereabouts, and some employees believed the animals had disintegrated. As well as the missing deer, two horses were missing. The museum contacted local newspapers, which published <b>stories</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> efforts to restore the carousel. The reports mentioned the missing animals, and that the museum was trying to locate them. An anonymous tip received in December 1973 revealed the deer were used in the annual Christmas Gift and Hobby Show, where they served as escorts for Santa Claus. Compton was able to secure the animals from the park district for the museum.|$|E
