The natives appeared pleased with their presents. The captain then addressed them, and endeavoured to explain that he wanted a supply of water. An empty barrel was brought up and some water poured into this, and the captain then pointed to the shore, and by gestures intimated that he wished the barrels to be taken ashore and filled. The chiefs evidently understood the explanation, and nodded their assent. The captain then led them to the stump of the mainmast, pointed to the shore, and taking an axe imitated the action of chopping, and showed that he wanted them to fell a tree and bring it off to the vessel. The chief pointed to the boats hanging on the davits, placed the axe in the hands of one of the men, and clearly signified that the crew could go ashore and cut down a tree if they chose. The captain shook his head and placed the axe in the hands of one of the chiefs. Their leader, however, went up to the foremast, and by spreading out his arms signified that it was a great size, and then held out the small axe the captain had presented to him with an action of disdain.|$|R

That they were {{for the most part}} cheap and common, and that the amount required for a sufficient stock of such merchandise would be very small. Small hand mirrors, <b>strings</b> <b>of</b> colored <b>glass</b> <b>beads,</b> brass rings and trinkets, colored handkerchiefs and bright cloths, were the articles chiefly used in barter. Knives and axes were greatly prized, the natives considering iron to be more valuable than silver or gold. Small bells and brass vessels were also valued, and iron spear and arrow heads were eagerly sought for; but the Spaniards were chary of providing such goods, seeing that they might be used in conflicts against themselves.|$|R

Many bracelets and other jewelry are made of silver with turquoise inlays, and rings have been made from brass or silver. Apache women historically wore a number of necklaces simultaneously, from chokers to strung beads of abalone and other shells, turquoise, jet, stones, <b>glass</b> <b>beads,</b> and certain seeds, such as mountain laurel seeds, and even plant roots. Necklaces often feature abalone shell pendants. When trade beads became available from Europeans and European-Americas, Apache women began wearing several layers <b>of</b> <b>string</b> <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> necklaces.

60|$|A great temptation {{had laid}} hold of Tessa's mind; {{she would go}} and take that old man part of her supper, {{and talk to him}} a little. He was not deaf like Monna Lisa, and besides she could say a great many things to him that it was no use to shout at Monna Lisa, who knew them already.

She turned away from her shutter with rather an excited expression in her childish face, which was as pretty and pouting as ever. Her garb was still that of a simple contadina, but of a contadina prepared for a festa: her gown of dark-green serge, with its red girdle, was very clean and neat; she had the <b>string</b> <b>of</b> red <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> round her neck; and her brown hair, rough from curliness, was duly knotted up, and fastened with the silver pin.

White is their natural colour, and rosy cheeks are common amongst the younger women and children, but all are begrimed with filth and smoke; added to which, they become so weather-worn from exposure to the most rigorous climate in the world, that their natural hues are rarely to be recognised. Their customary mode of saluting one another is to hold out the tongue, grin, nod, and scratch their ear; but this method entails so much ridicule in the low countries, {{that they do not}} practise it to Nepalese or strangers; most of them when meeting me, on the contrary, raised their hands to their eyes, threw themselves on the ground, and kotowed most decorously, bumping their foreheads three times on the ground; even the women did this on several occasions.

40|$|The archaeological record {{witnesses}} {{the presence}} <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> in early Iron Age Taiwan {{and the potential}} evidence <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> beadmaking on the southeastern coast. Previous research has proposed that the appearance <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> in Taiwan is {{in association with the}} South China Sea exchange network, and this particular material culture replaced the indigenous nephrite in local societies in Taiwan. Therefore, this research studies <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> from 7 Iron Age sites (Kiwulan, Jiuxianglan, Guishan, Daoye, Wujiancuo, Shisanhang and Xiliao) in Taiwan in an attempt to understand the provenance and hence exchange, consumption and production <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> in the 1 st millennium AD in Taiwan and the interaction shown by these specific goods with the South China Sea network. Beads from around the island, from Kiwulan, Jiuxianglan, Guishan, Daoye and Wujiancuo are analysed data in this research, and this is supplemented with data from Shisanhang and Xiliao from published reports. The evidence <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> beadmaking from Jiuxianglan is also investigated. The material covers a wide geographic region including northern, northeastern, southeastern, southern and southwestern Taiwan, and spans the 1 st millennium AD. To elucidate the research questions, the methodology chosen combines the typological study, compositional analysis (to trace elemental level), microstructural investigation and archaeological context <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> from each site. This research proposes regional and chronological patterns in terms of the typology and chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> in early Iron Age Taiwan, which suggests primarily a Southeast Asian source of early Iron Age <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> in Taiwan and later a transition to a Chinese origin during the turn of the 2 nd millennium AD. The results also indicate the presence of a regional exchange network within Taiwan, particularly within northern and northeastern Taiwan, which {{may be related to the}} socio-political interaction between societies. It is also found that the mortuary contexts <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> from different sites shows different degrees of social differentiation between the broad eastern and southwestern Taiwan. In addition, this research reveals a paradox between the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and <b>glass</b> waste from Jiuxianglan, which does not suggest the local production of finished beads at this site. The findings also do not indicate the exchange <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> made at Jiuxianglan to other contemporary sites in Taiwan. In addition, the production <b>of</b> m-Na-Al <b>glass</b> and v-Na-Ca glass and their movement within the broad South China Sea network suggests the possibility of shared knowledge but less standardised process <b>of</b> m-Na-Al <b>glass</b> production <b>of</b> the <b>beads</b> found in Taiwan, and a different tradition <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> colouring between m-Na-Al glass and v-Na-Ca glasses which may be related to different provenances...|$|R

40|$|Based on Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM), a damage {{model for}} glass-bead-filled {{modified}} polyphenylene oxide (GB/PPO) {{has been proposed}} to describe its damage behavior at various levels of tensile strain by considering the reduction of effective loading area. Hence, an equation for prediction of effective elastic modulus of the damaged GB/PPO composites {{in terms of the}} three principal true strains was derived. The tensile properties and damage behaviors of the GB/PPO composites with different volume percentages <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> were investigated using standard tensile tests and load-unload tests, respectively. The addition <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> increases Young's modulus of PPO but has a weakening effect on its tensile strength. A maximum value of tensile work to break and tensile strain at break was found when 5 vol% <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> with a mean diameter of 11 mu m was blended with PPO. These results were justified through microscopic examination of the fracture surfaces of the tensile specimens by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In-situ observations of the strain damage processes were made through the SEM equipped with a tensile stage to determine the strain at fully debonding <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads.</b> The volumetric strain of GB/PPO composites increases because of micro-cavitation during strain damage. In general, the prediction for the effective elastic modulus of the damaged GB/PPO composites at different true strains is slightly higher than the experimental results. The damage evolution rates after fully debonding <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> from the matrix are close to those predicted by the proposed damage model...|$|R

40|$|Pavement {{markings}} {{are vital}} for safely navigating roadways.

Concern has been raised over the presence of heavy metals in <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> used in pavement markings and their effect on human and environmental health. Based upon the potential risk associated {{with the presence of}} arsenic and lead in the <b>glass</b> <b>beads,</b> two Bills are currently being considered before the 112 th Congress of the United States of America seeking to set a maximum permissible limit for the amount of arsenic and lead in <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> used within pavement marking systems on domestic roadways. This study was designed to support legislative decision making by providing data necessary for risk assessment. The experiments carried out provide: an analysis <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> metal content and extractability; an evaluation of the relationship between arsenic content <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and their retroreflective performance; an evaluation of analytical methods used to measure the total bead metal content; and an analysis <b>of</b> samples <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> and soil mixture from a <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> storage site used to determine site-specific metal concentrations in the soil media. Mean arsenic content, measured using the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's KOH fusion digestion, in all the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> examined ranged from 11 ppm to 82 ppm, while mean lead content, measured using KOH fusion digestion, ranged from below quantification limit to 199 ppm. Total metal content measurements indicated a high amount of variability in the <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> samples; most likely associated with the use <b>of</b> recycled <b>glass</b> feed during manufacturing. The relationship between the retroreflective performance and the arsenic content <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> was analyzed and a weak but positive correlation was observed between the two factors.
