5|$|Several {{natural causes}} (diseases) have been suggested, {{including}} malaria and typhoid fever. A 1998 {{article in the}} New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis. Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) <b>spondylitis</b> or meningitis. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus. Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health {{may have been in}} general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.|$|E
5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for heel pain is extensive and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal bursitis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar spinal nerve 5 (L5) or sacral spinal nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> or rheumatoid arthritis (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} {{are not entirely}} clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot and a lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear {{if they have a}} role in causing the condition. Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. As inflammation plays a lesser role, many feel the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms with ultrasound sometimes used to help. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Several Smilodon fossils {{show signs}} of {{ankylosing}} <b>spondylitis,</b> hyperostosis and trauma; some also had arthritis, which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 Smilodon skulls found that 30% of them had eroded parietal bones, {{which is where the}} largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines. Bony growths where the deltoid muscle inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when Smilodon attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey. Some bones also show evidence of having been bitten by other Smilodon, with one skull showing an unhealed wound from a canine, seemingly fatal, and a scapula from the same site that had been pierced by a canine. The frequency of trauma in S. fatalis specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, which implies the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. Smilodon remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and lumbar vertebrae injuries.|$|E
25|$|Axial spondyloarthritis (including {{ankylosing}} <b>spondylitis)</b> – {{this involves}} the spine, although an RA-like symmetrical small-joint polyarthritis may {{occur in the}} context of this condition.|$|E
25|$|On June 25, placed OF Franklin Gutiérrez on the 10-day {{disabled}} list with ankylosis <b>spondylitis</b> and recalled IF/OF Mike Freeman from AAA Oklahoma City.|$|E
25|$|It was {{approved}} for treating ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis. Infliximab is also prescribed (out of indication) {{for the treatment}} of Behçet's disease.|$|E
25|$|Atherton {{suffers from}} the {{degenerative}} condition ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> which meant he could not duck under bouncers, but had to stand tall and sway out of the way. Allan Donald used this against him by bowling short.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, he {{accepted}} {{a position at}} the Lupus Center in Atlanta, Georgia. He later established a private practice in Marietta, Georgia and treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Paget's disease, ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> and Sjögren's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|About 10 {{percent of}} people with {{reactive}} arthritis, especially those with a prolonged course of the disease, will develop cardiac manifestations, including aortic regurgitation and pericarditis. Reiter's syndrome {{has been described as}} a precursor of other joint conditions, including ankylosing <b>spondylitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|People with rheumatologic {{disorders}} such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis {{are at increased risk}} of osteoporosis, either as part of their disease or because of other risk factors (notably corticosteroid therapy). Systemic diseases such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis can also lead to osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|Woosnam was {{diagnosed}} with ankylosing <b>spondylitis</b> (AS) in early 1987, which affects approximately 1 in 200 men and 1 in 500 women in Britain. In December that year, Woosnam won {{the first of his}} three BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year awards, which he went on to win in 1990 and 1991.|$|E
25|$|As of September 2012 {{apremilast}} is {{in phase}} III trials for psoriasis and phase II trials for rheumatoid arthritis. Efficacy in ankylosing <b>spondylitis</b> {{is also being}} tested. As of March 2014 apremilast has been approved for psoriatic arthritis. In September 2014, the U.S. FDA approved apremilast {{for the treatment of}} moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.|$|E
25|$|Autoimmune reaction: Having some MHC {{molecules}} {{increases the}} risk of autoimmune diseases more than having others. HLA-B27 is an example. It is unclear how exactly having the HLA-B27 tissue type {{increases the risk}} of ankylosing <b>spondylitis</b> and other associated inflammatory diseases, but mechanisms involving aberrant antigen presentation or T cell activation have been hypothesized.|$|E
25|$|It {{is a large}} molecule, with a {{molecular}} weight of 150 kDa., that binds to TNFα and decreases its role in disorders involving excess inflammation in humans and other animals, including autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and, potentially, {{in a variety of}} other disorders mediated by excess TNFα.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{autoimmune}} disorders {{have been recorded}} with the neurovisceral and cutaneous genetic porphyrias including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, diabetes, systemic and discoid lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> scleroderma, Sjogren's disease and scleritis. Physicians should be on high alert for porphyrias in families with {{autoimmune disorders}} and {{care must be taken}} with the use of potential porphyrinogenic drugs, including sulfasalazine.|$|E
25|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{used for}} autoimmune diseases include infliximab and adalimumab, which {{are effective in}} rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative Colitis and ankylosing <b>spondylitis</b> by their ability to bind to and inhibit TNF-α. Basiliximab and daclizumab inhibit IL-2 on activated T cells and thereby help prevent acute rejection of kidney transplants. Omalizumab inhibits human immunoglobulin E (IgE) and is useful in moderate-to-severe allergic asthma.|$|E
25|$|For example, Klebsiella pneumoniae and {{coxsackievirus}} B {{have been}} strongly correlated with ankylosing <b>spondylitis</b> and diabetes mellitus type 1, respectively. This has been {{explained by the}} tendency of the infecting organism to produce super-antigens {{that are capable of}} polyclonal activation of B-lymphocytes, and production of large amounts of antibodies of varying specificities, some of which may be self-reactive (see below).|$|E
25|$|Metabolic diseases, such as renal osteodystrophy, produce widening, while {{ochronosis}} {{results in}} calcific deposits in the symphysis. Inflammatory diseases, such as ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> result in bony fusion of the symphysis. Osteitis pubis, {{the most common}} inflammatory disease in this area, is treated with anti-inflammatory medication and rest. Degenerative joint disease of the symphysis, which can cause groin pain, results from instability or from abnormal pelvic mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory {{disorders}} {{may include}} musculoskeletal complaints, especially arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, osteoarthritis, dental pain, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, spondylarthritis, ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> gout attacks, and pain management {{in cases of}} kidney stones and gallstones. An additional indication is the treatment of acute migraines. Diclofenac is used commonly to treat mild to moderate postoperative or post-traumatic pain, in particular when inflammation is also present, and is effective against menstrual pain and endometriosis.|$|E
25|$|Total hip {{replacement}} is {{most commonly used}} to treat joint failure caused by osteoarthritis. Other indications include rheumatoid arthritis, avascular necrosis, traumatic arthritis, protrusio acetabuli, certain hip fractures, benign and malignant bone tumors, arthritis associated with Paget's disease, ankylosing <b>spondylitis</b> and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The aims of the procedure are pain relief and improvement in hip function. Hip replacement is usually considered only after other therapies, such as physical therapy and pain medications, have failed.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{systemic}} diseases {{are associated with}} IgA nephropathy such as liver failure, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, ankylosing <b>spondylitis</b> and HIV. Diagnosis of IgA nephropathy and a search for any associated disease occasionally reveals such an underlying serious systemic disease. Occasionally, there are simultaneous symptoms of Henoch–Schönlein purpura; see below for more details on the association. Some HLA alleles have been suspected along with complement phenotypes as being genetic factors.|$|E
25|$|Some {{chemotherapy}} {{drugs are}} used in diseases other than cancer, such as in autoimmune disorders, and noncancerous plasma cell dyscrasia. In some cases they are often used at lower doses, {{which means that the}} side effects are minimized, while in other cases doses similar to ones used to treat cancer are used. Methotrexate is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, ankylosing <b>spondylitis</b> and multiple sclerosis. The anti-inflammatory response seen in RA is thought to be due to increases in adenosine, which causes immunosuppression; effects on immuno-regulatory cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme pathways; reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines; and anti-proliferative properties. Although methotrexate is used to treat both multiple sclerosis and ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> its efficacy in these diseases is still uncertain. Cyclophosphamide is sometimes used to treat lupus nephritis, a common symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus. Dexamethasone along with either bortezomib or melphalan is commonly used as a treatment for AL amyloidosis. Recently, bortezomid in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone has also shown promise as a treatment for AL amyloidosis. Other drugs used to treat myeloma such as lenalidomide have shown promise in treating AL amyloidosis.|$|E
25|$|Infliximab (trade names Remicade among others) is a {{chimeric}} {{monoclonal antibody}} biologic drug that works against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) {{and is used}} to treat autoimmune diseases. Infliximab {{was approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> and rheumatoid arthritis. It is used off-label outside its FDA approval for Behçet's disease and other conditions. Infliximab is administered by intravenous infusion, typically at six- to eight-week intervals. It cannot be given by mouth because the digestive system would destroy the drug.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} may be self-limiting, frequently recurring, chronic or progressive. Most {{patients have}} severe symptoms lasting {{a few weeks}} to six months. 15 to 50 percent of cases involve recurrent bouts of arthritis. Chronic arthritis or sacroiliitis occurs in 15–30 percent of cases. Repeated attacks over many years are common, and patients sometimes end up with chronic and disabling arthritis, heart disease, amyloid deposits, ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> immunoglobulin A nephropathy, cardiac conduction abnormalities, or aortitis with aortic regurgitation. However, most people with reactive arthritis can expect to live normal life spans and maintain a near-normal lifestyle with modest adaptations to protect the involved organs.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} the cause of aortic insufficiency, is often due to the aortic root {{dilation}} (annuloaortic ectasia), which is idiopathic in over 80% of cases, but otherwise may result from aging, syphilitic aortitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, aortic dissection, Behçet's disease, reactive arthritis and systemic hypertension. Aortic root dilation {{is the most common}} cause of aortic insufficiency in developed countries. Additionally, aortic insufficiency has been linked to the use of some medications, specifically medications containing fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine isomers and dopamine agonists. Other potential causes that affect the valve directly include Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> and systemic lupus erythematosus. In acute cases of aortic insufficiency, the main causes are infective endocarditis, aortic dissection or trauma.|$|E
25|$|HLA {{types are}} inherited, {{and some of}} them are {{connected}} with autoimmune disorders and other diseases. People with certain HLA antigens are more likely to develop certain autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> celiac disease, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), myasthenia gravis, inclusion body myositis, Sjögren syndrome, and narcolepsy. HLA typing has led to some improvement and acceleration in the diagnosis of celiac disease and type 1 diabetes; however, for DQ2 typing to be useful, it requires either high-resolution B1*typing (resolving *02:01 from *02:02), DQA1*typing, or DR serotyping. Current serotyping can resolve, in one step, DQ8. HLA typing in autoimmunity is being increasingly used as a tool in diagnosis. In celiac disease, it is the only effective means of discriminating between first-degree relatives that are at risk from those that are not at risk, prior to the appearance of sometimes-irreversible symptoms such as allergies and secondary autoimmune disease.|$|E
25|$|In September 1939, {{upon the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Macleod enlisted in the British Army as a private in the Royal Fusiliers. In April 1940 he was commissioned as an officer in the Duke of Wellington's Regiment, and was posted to the regiment's 2/7th Battalion, which was then serving as part of the 137th Infantry Brigade of the 46th Infantry Division, a second line Territorial Army (TA) formation, then commanded by Major-General Henry Curtis. Macleod's battalion was sent overseas to France in time to see action in the Battle of France in May, where he was injured in the leg by a flying log when a German armoured car burst through a road block which his men had just erected. He was treated in hospital in Exeter and left with a lifelong slight limp. In later life, besides his limp he suffered pain and reduced mobility from a spinal condition (ankylosing <b>spondylitis).</b>|$|E

500|$|Psoriatic {{arthritis}} {{is a form}} {{of chronic}} inflammatory arthritis that has a highly variable clinical presentation and frequently occurs in association with skin and nail psoriasis. It typically involves painful inflammation of the joints and surrounding connective tissue and can occur in any joint, but most commonly affects the joints of the fingers and toes. [...] This can result in a sausage-shaped swelling of the fingers and toes known as dactylitis. Psoriatic arthritis can also affect the hips, knees, spine (<b>spondylitis),</b> and sacroiliac joint (sacroiliitis). About 30% of individuals with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis. Skin manifestations of psoriasis tend to occur before arthritic manifestations in about 75% of cases.|$|E
500|$|Evidence {{of several}} {{different}} bone diseases {{has been found}} in woolly mammoths. The most common of these diseases was osteoarthritis, found in 2% of specimens. One specimen from Switzerland had several fused vertebrae {{as a result of this}} condition. The [...] "Yukagir mammoth" [...] had suffered from <b>spondylitis</b> in two vertebrae, and osteomyelitis is also known from some specimens. Several specimens have healed bone fractures, showing that the animals had survived these injuries. An abnormal number of cervical vertebrae {{has been found in}} 33% of specimens from the North Sea region, probably due to inbreeding in a declining population. Parasitic flies and protozoa were identified in the gut of the calf [...] "Dima".|$|E
500|$|According to Scotland on Sunday, Gunn {{suffers from}} {{ankylosing}} <b>spondylitis,</b> [...] "a rheumatic spinal condition", diagnosed in about 1995, [...] "which he controls with medication". He appeared in an ITV2 celebrity football quiz called [...] "Taking the Pitch" [...] in 1998, alongside singer Fish. Gunn's autobiography—In Where it Hurts—was published in 2006, {{and includes a}} foreword by his former manager Alex Ferguson. He said of writing the book, [...] "it brought {{up a lot of}} good memories and a lot of awkward memories". The book was described by The Times as [...] "shot through with sharp humour and astute observation". The publishers agreed to donate £1 to Gunn's Leukaemia appeal fund for every book sold.|$|E
500|$|The qualifiers {{went through}} to face {{members of the}} top 16. In this round, Davis came from 2–4 down to beat Joe Swail 5–4, in a match where both players missed chances. In the {{deciding}} frame, Davis won on the pink ball after Swail had missed the brown. After the match, Davis {{said it was a}} historic day as he had never won a match in the country. Stephen Lee received a walkover to the next round after his opponent Robin Hull withdrew due to medical reasons. World number 41 Stephen Maguire made a [...] of 89 in the final frame of his match against Peter Ebdon to win 5–4, and world number three O'Sullivan opened his match against Marco Fu with a century break of 110 and went on to win 5–1. Chris Small, who suffers from the spinal condition ankylosing <b>spondylitis,</b> whitewashed UK champion Matthew Stevens 5–0, in a match lasting almost three hours and which saw Stevens lose two frames on the black ball. Neil Robertson defeated Ken Doherty 5–3, and Joe Perry beat David Roe by the same scoreline. In the last match of the day, David Gray beat Fergal O'Brien 5–3.|$|E
