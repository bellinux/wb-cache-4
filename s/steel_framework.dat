Skyscrapers usually have a particularly small surface area of what are conventionally thought of as walls.

However, skyscrapers can also have curtain walls that mimick conventional walls and have a small surface area of windows.|$|E

25|$|The Flatiron Building, {{designed}} by Daniel Hudson Burnham and standing 285ft (87m) high, {{was one of}} the tallest buildings in New York City upon its completion in 1902, made possible by its steel skeleton.

(The Tower Building, {{designed by}} Bradford Gilbert and built in 1889, is considered by some to be New York City's first skyscraper, and may have been the first building in New York City to use a skeletal steel frame, while the Home Insurance Building in Chicago, which was built in 1884, is considered the world's first skyscraper due to its steel skeleton).

25|$|Directly {{behind the}} cockpit and {{underneath}} the main rotor was the rotorcraft's engine and its nylon bag-type fuel tank, which was housed within a welded tubular <b>steel</b> <b>framework</b> attached to the cockpit structure and to the tailboom. Power was directed to the tail rotor via a torque shaft contained within the tail cone, which featured gearing so that pilots could readily adjust the speed and direction of tail rotor movement. The engine was provided with cooling air via an intake on {{the centre of the}} starboard side of the rotorcraft; for improved ventilation, the cowling around the engine area could be entirely removed. The de Havilland Gipsy Major that was used to power the majority of Skeeters was credited with being a major contributor to the rotorcraft's relatively high fuel efficiency due to its use of fuel injectors (the high aerodynamic efficiency of the airframe itself was another beneficial factor).|$|E
25|$|Above {{ground the}} tower is {{accessed}} by a grand, two-storey high lobby, surrounded by clear glass in stainless <b>steel</b> <b>framework.</b> The BNZ originally occupied three levels with their branch office, {{and the top}} seven floors with their head office.

This level {{was connected to the}} floors below with the historical Beauchamp Stair, relocated from the Old BNZ Building. Because of its sheer size and steel construction the building is relatively flexible. Its response to frequent Wellington earthquakes is relatively good. Of greater effect is Wellington’s wind which is accommodated by the building’s ability to flex by up to 300mm in hurricane-force winds.

Ironworkers assemble the structural framework in accordance with engineered drawings. Ironworkers also unload, place and tie reinforcing steel bars (rebar) as well as install post-tensioning systems, both of which give strength to the concrete used in piers, footings, slabs, buildings and bridges. Ironworkers load, unload, place and set machinery and equipment and operate power hoists, forklifts, and aerial lifts. They unload, place and fasten metal decking, safety netting and edge rails to facilitate safe working practices. Ironworkers finish buildings by erecting curtain wall and window wall systems, pre-cast concrete and stone, stairs and handrails, metal doors, sheeting and elevator fronts.

Although the 18,000-psi regulation had been safely enacted in other cities, Mayor Jimmy Walker did not sign the new codes into law until March 26, 1930, just before the steel was about to be laid. The first <b>steel</b> <b>framework</b> was put into place on April 1, 1930. From there, construction proceeded at a fast pace. During one stretch of 10 working days, the builders erected fourteen floors. This was made possible due to the extremely precise coordination of the building's planning, as well as the mass production of common materials such as windows and spandrels. For instance, after a supplier of dark Hauteville marble could not deliver enough material on time, Starrett switched to using Rose Famosa marble from a German quarry that was purchased specifically to provide the project with sufficient marble.|$|E

The Rotachute Mark I design initially comprised a tubular <b>steel</b> <b>framework</b> with a single seat, rubber-mounted rotor hub, hanging control column, skid undercarriage, and a self-inflating rear fairing made of rubberised fabric with integral tailplane. The two rotor blades, of wooden construction, could achieve flapping and coning characteristics via hinges on the rotor hub. Fixed footrests were provided, plus fittings below the seat to accommodate a soldier's weapon, such as a Bren gun. The control column offered two-axis control, rolling and pitching, with turns made via controlled rolling movement. Air Ministry Specification No. 11/42 was issued retrospectively to describe the outline requirements. The Ministry of Aircraft Production sub-contracted construction of parts to specialist firms including F. Hills and Sons, Airwork General Trading, Dynaflex, Dunlop, and H. Morris & Co. Some full size rotor trials were carried out using a pivoting rig mounted on a Ford flatbed truck, and full-size unmanned airframes were used in ground-based and inflight trials.|$|E
