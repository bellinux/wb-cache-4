25|$|In 2004, {{there was}} a spy scandal {{involving}} the CIA. Rabinder Singh, Joint Secretary {{and the head of}} R's South East Asia department, defected to America on 5 June 2004. R had already become suspicious about his movements and he was under surveillance for a very long time. Soon he was confronted by Counter Intelligence officials on 19 April 2004. Despite all precautions, Rabinder Singh managed to defect with 'sensitive files' he had allegedly removed from R's headquarters in south New Delhi. This embarrassing fiasco and national <b>security</b> <b>failure</b> were attributed to weak surveillance, shoddy investigation and lack of co-ordination between the Counter Intelligence and Security, Intelligence Bureau (IB) and R According to unconfirmed reports, Singh has surfaced in Virginia, USA. Recently in an affidavit submitted to the court, R deposed that Singh has been traced in New Jersey.

40|$|This {{research}} study explores how {{the nature and}} type of usability failures impact task performance in a healthcare organization. Healthcare organizations are composed of heterogeneous and disparate information systems intertwined with complex business processes that create many challenges for the users of the system. The manner in which Information Technology systems and products are implemented along with the overlapping intricate tasks the users have pose problems {{in the area of}} usability. Usability research primarily focuses on the user interface; therefore, designing a better interface often leaves security in question. When usability failures arise from the incongruence between healthcare task and the technology used in healthcare organizations, the security of information is jeopardized. Hence, the research problem is to understand the nature and types of usability-related <b>security</b> <b>failures</b> and how they can be reduced in a Healthcare Information System. This research used a positivist single case study design with embedded units, to understand the nature and type of usability-related information systems <b>security</b> <b>failures</b> in a Healthcare context. The nature and types of usability failures were identified following a four-step data analysis process that used terms that defined (1) user failures in a large healthcare organization, (2) Task Technology Fit theory, (3) the Confidentiality Integrity and Availability triad of information protection that captured usability-related information system <b>security</b> <b>failures,</b> and (4) by conducting semi-structured interviews with users of the Healthcare Information System capturing and recording their interactions with the usability failure. The captured reported usability-related information system <b>security</b> <b>failures</b> dated back five years within a healthcare organization consisting of a network of 128 medical centers. The evaluation of five years of data and over 8, 000 problems reported by healthcare workers allowed this research to identify the misalignment of healthcare task to the technology used, and how the misalignment impacted both information security and user performance. The nature of usability failures were centered on technical controls, however, the cause of the failures was predominately information integrity failures and the unavailability of applications and systems. Usability-related information system <b>security</b> <b>failures</b> are primarily not recognized {{due to the nature of}} healthcare task along with the methods healthcare workers use to mitigate such failures by employing workarounds to complete a task. Applying non-technical security controls within the development process provides the clearest path to addressing throughout the organization the captured usability-related information system <b>security</b> <b>failures...</b>|$|R

50|$|Fail-safe and {{fail-secure}} {{are distinct}} concepts. Fail-safe {{means that a}} device will not endanger lives or property when it fails. Fail-secure, also called fail-closed, means that access or data will not fall {{into the wrong hands}} in a <b>security</b> <b>failure.</b> Sometimes the approaches suggest opposite solutions. For example, if a building catches fire, fail-safe systems would unlock doors to ensure quick escape and allow firefighters inside, while fail-secure would lock doors to prevent unauthorized access to the building.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{manufacturer}} {{incentives to}} invest in the improvement of reliability and security of a software system when (i) reliability and <b>security</b> <b>failures</b> are caused by the same errors {{in the development of the}} software components and (ii) naive users find it too costly to distinguish between these two classes of system failures. We trace the effects of these informational imperfections and discuss how the resulting supply and demand externalities affect manufacturer investments. When users cannot distinguish between reliability and <b>security</b> <b>failures</b> and investment in system security is driven by the weakest link, the standard for optimal due care then depends on manufacturer characteristics with respect to both security and reliability. In this case, imposition of a due care standard based solely on reliability or on security becomes socially suboptimal...|$|R

50|$|Possibly {{the most}} devastating OAuth <b>security</b> <b>failure</b> is {{phishing}} vulnerability: every web site using OAuth is visually (but not technically) asking end users for their username and password of their master identity, which prevents ordinary users from understanding {{that they should not}} type those in should they encounter an attacker's web site that visually emulates this process to steal credentials. Traditional two-factor authentication (using One-time passwords) does not prevent this attack, because the phishing site can steal that as well, using it immediately (Note that Universal 2nd Factor tokens aren't vulnerable to this specific type attack).|$|E

40|$|Abstract It {{has been}} known for many years that <b>security</b> <b>failures</b> are caused at least as often by bad {{incentives}} as by bad design. However, the regulatory correction of bad incentives is not easy in practice and it is still lacking. In the meantime, system dynamics models of security systems can improve the situation by increasing the awareness that misaligned incentives can backfire as long-term consequences of <b>security</b> <b>failures</b> hit back the principal. We illustrate our argument using system archetypes and concept simulation models revealing the impact of two different security strategies, viz. misaligned incentives (the customer having the burden of proof in case of alleged fraud) vs the bank having the burden of proof. From this we argue that online system dynamics could be used in eGovernment to educate principals and the public. Also, legal measures could become more effective when supported with forensic evidence from simulation models. ...|$|R

The IRA claimed responsibility on 8 October, in a telephone call to RTÉ news in Dublin. The IRA statement said the target had been barracks personnel and said injuries to civilians were regretted. According to one source, the main <b>security</b> <b>failure</b> that allowed the IRA to penetrate the base was the external security checkpoints and cameras.

5000|$|Stammberger {{provided}} to the FBI Norse's findings that suggest the hack was an inside job, stating, [...] "Sony was not just hacked; this {{is a company that}} was essentially nuked from the inside. We are very confident that this was not an attack master-minded by North Korea and that insiders were key to the implementation {{of one of the most}} devastating attacks in history." [...] Stammberger believes that the <b>security</b> <b>failure</b> may have originated from six disgruntled former Sony employees, based on their past skill sets and discussions these people made in chat rooms. Norse employees identified these people from a list of workers that were eliminated from Sony during a restructuring in May 2014, and noted that some had made very public and angry responses to their firing, and would be in appropriate positions to identify the means to access secure parts of Sony's servers. After a private briefing lasting three hours, the FBI formally rejected Norse's alternative assessment.|$|E
50|$|Some 12,000 {{security}} personnel were on guard against {{attack from the}} Taliban, but could not prevent that attacks launched by the Taliban targeted the opening session of the NCPJ on June 2. President Hamid Karzai's speech was interrupted by gunfire and nearby rocket explosions. The first rocket attack struck near the jirga site during his opening address. A gunfight then ensued as police attacked suspected suicide bombers attempting to detonate explosives near the tent where the assembly was held, and a second rocket was later launched. There were no reported casualties among the approximately 1,600 delegates who attended the NCPJ. The Afghan police said they had shot and killed two suspected suicide bombers and taken a third into custody. The Taliban {{claimed responsibility for the}} attack. A Taliban spokesman claimed they had sent four suicide bombers to target the assembly, and said they were shooting rockets into the tent from the roof of a nearby building. The attack marked a major failure of the security effort for the meeting. Given the presence of the country's top leaders and foreign diplomats at the venue, the attacks on the NCPJ were seen as a major <b>security</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E

To test this hypothesis, we performed a case study of a security program which does have a good user interface by general standards: PGP 5. 0.

5000|$|Intrusion {{tolerance}} is a fault-tolerant design {{approach to}} defending information systems against malicious attack. Abandoning the conventional aim of preventing all intrusions, intrusion tolerance instead calls for triggering mechanisms that prevent intrusions from {{leading to a}} system <b>security</b> <b>failure.</b> Intrusion response is {{a key component of}} intrusion tolerance, in which an automated response is launched to a detected intrusion. Surveys of intrusion tolerance and intrusion response techniques {{can be found at the}} following links [...] and. The survey categorizes the response systems as either static or dynamic (or adaptive). Static systems are simple in nature and have a static mapping from the symptom of an intrusion to the response that should be taken. For example, when a packet with a malware sample is intercepted, blacklist the IP address from which the packet was sent. Dynamic systems are more complex and learn from the context and there is no fixed mapping from symptom to response action. For example, the initial response to the malware-laden packet may be to slow down further connection attempts and after some time blacklist the IP address and then blacklist the subnet that the IP address belongs to.|$|E
