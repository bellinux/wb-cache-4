25|$|In a reach where Ackerly Creek flows {{alongside}} US Route 6 and US Route 11, it {{has been}} managed and straightened. This contributes significantly to streambank erosion on the creek. There are roughly a dozen sites with unstable <b>stream</b> <b>bank,</b> {{and there are several}} bridge crossings of the creek. There is relatively little garbage along the creek.|$|E
25|$|Further upstream, on {{the western}} side of Chandlers Ford, the brook once again forms a green {{corridor}} and is a nature reserve, bordered by large alder trees. Wildflowers in the area include bluebells, yellow archangels and Solomon's seal. Closer to the <b>stream</b> <b>bank</b> itself, wild garlic grows profusely, and wild birds to be seen include the kingfisher and grey wagtail.|$|E
50|$|There are {{currently}} local volunteer groups which are restoring the <b>stream</b> <b>banks</b> with native bushes and trees. Farmers have also replanted their <b>stream</b> <b>banks</b> {{to stop them}} collapsing. This restoration work {{can be seen by}} kayaking down the stream.|$|R

25|$|Excessive <b>stream</b> <b>bank</b> erosion {{may cause}} {{flooding}} and property damage. For many years governments have often responded to urban stream erosion problems by modifying the streams through construction of hardened embankments and similar control structures using concrete and masonry materials. Use of these hard materials destroys habitat for {{fish and other}} animals. Such a project may stabilize the immediate area where flood damage occurred, but often it simply shifts the problem to an upstream or downstream segment of the stream. See River engineering.|$|E
25|$|January 23, 1812, 1515 UTC (9:15 a.m.); (M ~7.3) {{epicenter}} around New Madrid, {{although this}} is disputed. This was probably {{the smallest of the}} three main shocks, but resulted in widespread ground deformation, landslides, fissuring, and <b>stream</b> <b>bank</b> caving in the meizoseismal area. Johnston and Schweig attributed this earthquake to a rupture on the New Madrid North Fault. A minority viewpoint holds that this earthquake's epicenter was in southern Illinois. A 2011 expert panel urged further research to clarify this point, stating that the Illinois hypothesis would mean that an extended section of fault exists, perhaps still loaded and capable of hosting a great earthquake in the future.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the larvae}} reach their maximum size, {{metamorphosis}} occurs. Sexual maturity is reached in this species at {{three to four}} years old. The adults and juveniles tend to be restricted to the stream edges, hiding under rocks and other debris during the day. Seasonal migration does occur, but not all individuals undertake them. Research done in Quebec suggests a postbreeding migration into the forest occurs in June. These adult salamanders may move over 100 m from the stream. The second migration is that of the newly metamorphosed juveniles leaving the stream, but they tend to remain closer to it. About 75% of individuals dispersing over 100 m into the forest did not return, and they were believed to have been consumed by predators. The majority of above-ground movements are made after dark and in wet weather. The diets of the adults are more wide-ranging than the larvae because of the amount of habitat that can be exploited, both terrestrial and aquatic. The movements of juveniles and adults usually occurs in the first hour after dark, when they emerge from under their retreats and forage along the <b>stream</b> <b>bank</b> or forest floor. Food items recorded include wood roaches, arachnids, worms, isopods, millipedes, beetles, snails, springtails, flies, hymenopterans, sowbugs, mayflies, annelids, stonefly nymphs, and thrips and rarely trout fry. Adult population densities are variable by habitat quality. Adults are also territorial, so if resources are scarce, the population is less dense. In some populations, densities are as low as 0.02-0.04 animals/m2. In other areas, localized densities can be as high as 11 individuals /m2. Adults overwinter up to 80cm deep into the soil of the <b>stream</b> <b>bank</b> in cold climates, but may remain somewhat active in southern regions, and may continue feeding during this period.|$|E

25|$|On August 10, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Regimental Combat Team, {{held the}} {{southern}} {{of these two}} ridges at Pongam-ni and B and C Companies of the 1st Battalion held {{the eastern part of}} the northern one. The North Koreans held the remainder of this ridge and contested control of the pass. During the day the regiment's support artillery came up and went into positions in the stream bed and low ground at Pongam-ni and Taejong-ni. A Battery of the 555th Field Artillery Battalion emplaced under the concrete bridge at Pongam-ni, and B Battery went into position along the <b>stream</b> <b>bank</b> at the edge of the village. Headquarters Battery established itself in the village. The 90th Field Artillery Battalion, less one battery, had emplaced on the west side of the south-flowing stream. All the artillery pieces were on the north side of the east-west road. The 5th Regimental Combat Team headquarters and C Battery of the 555th Field Artillery Battalion were eastward in a rear position.|$|E
25|$|Grenier's victorious {{soldiers}} were rapidly marched east to Tarvis {{to assist in}} the attack against Gyulai. The Austrian commander took up a position behind the Slizza (Gailitz) stream with 11 battalions and four squadrons. In line were Gajoli's brigade, Marziani's brigade, three battalions of the Strassoldo Infantry Regiment Nr. 27, and two battalions of the Marburg Landwehr. A line of prepared defenses lined the <b>stream</b> <b>bank,</b> but only 10 of the planned 24 cannons were installed in the redoubts. At mid-day Eugène waved his troops forward. While Grenier's corps skirmished with Gyulai's center, Fontanelli's Italian division hit the Austrian left flank. The Italians seized a key redoubt and began rolling up Gyulai's defenses from the south. As the Austrian line began to crumble, Grenier's troops attacked in front. Gyulai's troops fled the field in rout, losing 3,000 killed, wounded, and prisoners, and most of their guns. Lacking cavalry, the Franco-Italians were not able to pursue. The Austrians admitted losing 217 killed, 271 wounded, and 1,301 captured, for a total of 1,789 men and six guns lost out of 3,500 engaged. Eugène admitted 80 killed and 300 wounded out of 10,000 engaged, though the latter figure does not count Grenier's troops which are listed as reserves.|$|E

Arnold Creek has riparian corridors wider than [...] in good condition, while Falling Creek's riparian zones, surrounded by homes, are in poor condition. Damaged zones from which native vegetation has been removed lead to erosion, <b>stream</b> <b>bank</b> failure, sedimentation, lack of shading, and higher stream temperatures.|$|E
