50|$|On January 16, 1887, the Boston breaker was {{destroyed}} by fire. The Delaware & Hudson built a <b>second</b> <b>breaker,</b> this time adjacent to the mine. It was completed by November 1887. In 1909, the second Boston breaker was demolished and coal from the mine processed at the Delaware & Hudson No. 5 colliery.|$|E
5000|$|The St. Nicholas Breaker {{first became}} {{operational}} on March 11, 1931. It was the <b>second</b> <b>breaker</b> {{in the area}} to be named after St. Nicholas; the first was built in 1861 and torn down in 1928. When the new breaker opened, it was the [...] "crown jewel of a relatively safer, more modern anthracite industry". However, the breaker stopped operating in 1965.|$|E

As a consequence of that introduction, John Sumner, soon agreed to direct Ross's <b>second</b> play, <b>Breaker</b> Morant.|$|R
50|$|On July 13, 1899, {{the first}} Dodson breaker burned down, and on March 5, 1900, work {{began on the}} <b>second</b> <b>breaker.</b> In 1914, Plymouth Borough {{obtained}} an injunction preventing the Plymouth Coal Co. from mining, owing to surface subsidence, {{and for most of}} that year the mine was idle. In January 1915, the Kingston Coal Co., which operated the adjacent Gaylord Colliery, announced it would buy the Dodson mine.|$|E
50|$|On September 6, 1869, the Avondale Mine Disaster occurred, {{during which}} {{a fire in}} the shaft, ignited by a {{ventilating}} furnace, spread to the breaker which stood over the mine shaft. The breaker was destroyed by fire, trapping 108 men and boys in the mine below. All were killed, as were two men who volunteered to enter the mine after the fire. Soon after the disaster, a <b>second</b> <b>breaker</b> was built at the colliery.|$|E
50|$|The power {{produced}} by each alternator was {{carried to the}} outgoing breakers. Each breaker, or line, was directed toward the substation and from there supplied numerous customers. The first breaker had a 10kV capacity installed in the substation that supplied Lisbon’s electric grid and two more breakers, one with 3.3 kV and another with a 30 kV capacity. Of these two breakers, the first and oldest, aside from supplying power to the consumer grid, also powered the Tejo Power Station’s auxiliary services. Two cables set out from the <b>second</b> <b>breaker</b> with a 30 kV capacity; one to Marvila and continuing on to Vila Franca de Xira, and the other directly {{to the city of}} Santarém, to supply the industrial clientele situated along the Tejo Valley.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stop at the}} Breakers Hotel {{north of}} Long Beach was called [...] "Breakers Station." [...] There had been two hotels at this location, both built by Joseph M. Arthur, and both named the Breakers Hotel. The first Breakers Hotel, built in 1901, burned down in 1904. The second one, pictured in the images here, {{replaced}} it. The image at right shows the Breakers Hotel from the beach side looking east. The hotel was built just behind a sand dune, and the rail line ran between the hotel and {{the trees in the}} background. A promotional postcard for the <b>second</b> <b>Breakers</b> Hotel advertised it as the [...] "social center of the summer season," [...] with the [...] "best ladies' orchestra," [...] a [...] "large dancing pavilion," [...] and [...] "practically fire-proof." [...] Guests were encouraged to [...] "buy your ticket and check your baggage at any O.R.& N Co. Ticket Office direct to Breakers Station" ...|$|R

40|$|Disturbance {{of power}} system in ship is {{unavoidable}} case {{that required a}} function from safety system to separate the affected parts of system. The disturbance in electrical system generally is a short-circuit current. It is affected when there are two conductors having lowest impedance in normal condition that have two different voltages thus causing an overcurrent. There {{is one of the}} device protection to prevent a disturbance like short circuit current, is circuit breaker. It opens the contact with component or system that disturbance using electromechanical trip device. The principal operating of trip device is using electric current flow in the circuit breaker and the magnet induces the tripping part to moving the contact from closed position to the opened position. The main discussion is to coordinate circuit breakers in four operating conditions of the ship's generator using software ETAP. The simulation of the result obtained value of short circuit in main bus one at sailing condition is 8. 2 kA. Tripping time for the circuit breakers in sailing condition at one typical disturbance are 0. 75 <b>seconds</b> for circuit <b>breaker</b> number 29; 0. 83 <b>seconds</b> for circuit <b>breaker</b> number 37 and 1 <b>second</b> for circuit <b>breaker</b> number 28...|$|R
5000|$|On April 27, 1907, the No. 5 breaker {{burned to}} the ground, causing an [...] "awe inspiring spectacle." [...] At the time, the breaker had been {{abandoned}} by the D&H and was {{being used as a}} washery by the Rissinger Bros. By 1909, a <b>second</b> <b>breaker</b> was built, intended to process coal from several D & H mines. In 1914, The D&H was operating both the breaker and a washery and waste water from these was dumped into Shupp's Creek, not Brown's Creek, suggesting that the breaker may have been relocated from its original site to a new one farther south. In 1919, fire destroyed the second No. 5 breaker. That year, a new reinforced concrete breaker, called the Loree No. 5 Breaker, was built to process coal from all of the D&H operations in Plymouth.|$|E
50|$|The Washington Colliery {{was first}} opened by John Shay about 1854. Shay built a drift, an {{inclined}} plane, and a breaker. Shutz, Shay & Heebner operated the colliery until August 1869, when they sold {{their rights to}} Broderick, Conyngham & Co. At the same time, BC&C entered into leases to operate the Nottingham Colliery, the old John Smith mine and the old Abijah Smith mine, {{and from then on}} all four mines were operated under common management. On April 1, 1872 BC&C sold their lease to the Lehigh Navigation & Coal Co., and on January 1, 1874, the LN&C sold to the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co. which operated the mine as the Reynolds No. 16. By April 1890, the first breaker had been dismantled and a new breaker was in operation. In 1908, the L&W-B abandoned the <b>second</b> <b>breaker</b> and began to process coal from the Washington mine at the Nottingham breaker. In March 1912, the company destroyed the Washington breaker with dynamite.|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{solid-state}} circuit breaker that can be interconnected to a <b>second</b> <b>breaker</b> to form a transfer switch is presented. The breaker operates on a nominal 270 -V dc circuit and controls power to loads of up to 15 A. Automatic overload trip is provided {{as a function of}} excess energy measured through the breaker and/or excess current through the breaker. After an overload trip, up to nine preprogrammable attempts to reclose may be tried with programmable delays between each attempt. The breaker or switch is remotely controllable. Test data on performance in the laboratory over temperatures from - 45 to 100 C are provided. The feasibility of solid-state switch gear has been established...|$|E

50|$|The ﬁrst player, Maker, has {{to occupy}} a winning set to win; and the <b>second</b> player, <b>Breaker,</b> has to stop Maker from doing so; if Breaker {{successfully}} prevents maker from occupying a winning set {{to the end of}} the game, then Breaker wins. Thus, in a Maker-Breaker positional game, Maker wins if he occupies all elements of some winning set and Breaker wins if he prevents Maker from doing so. There can be no draw in a Maker-Breaker positional game: one player always wins.|$|R
50|$|When tictactoe {{is played}} as a Maker-Breaker {{positional}} game, Maker has a winning strategy. This difference from tictactoe arises because, in tictactoe, when the <b>second</b> player (<b>Breaker)</b> takes two squares in a line, {{the first player}} (Maker) must respond to the threat by blocking the line. This forced response {{may be used to}} divert Maker from getting a winning line. In the corresponding Maker-Breaker game, Maker can ignore these threats, because getting three in a row first is not a winning condition for Breaker.|$|R

50|$|On 9 July 2014, Bailey {{signed a}} one-year deal (with {{the option of}} a <b>second)</b> with the <b>Breakers.</b> Gaining a full roster spot for the 2014-15 season earned Bailey more playing time as he {{appeared}} in 27 games, averaging 2.0 points and 1.2 rebounds, {{and in the process}} became an Australian NBL champion after the Breakers defeated the Cairns Taipans 2-1 in the best-of-three grand final series.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1935, the Glen Alden Coal Co. {{bought the}} Gaylord mine from the Kingston Coal Co. for $100,000. Glen Alden paid about $40,000 in back taxes owed to Plymouth Township, Plymouth Borough and Larksville Borough. On June 15, 1935, the <b>second</b> Gaylord <b>breaker</b> was {{demolished}} with dynamite. By this time, the mine was largely depleted, but in December 1940, the Sunday Independent reported that [...] "the old Gaylord mine, now being operated by Samuel Bird, brother of Morgan Bird, is {{showing signs of}} being able to absorb additional number of men in the future...the Lance breaker prepares the coal." [...] In 1945, the Gaylord worked 284 days and produced 26,301 tons of coal, and In January 1955, the Bird Mining Co. stopped mining at the Gaylord.|$|R

5000|$|The Olympic {{competition}} {{was the closest}} in history, with all three medalists tied with the same weight lifted. The first tiebreaker was the athlete's body weight and Samadov was [...]05 kg heavier, pushing him to the bronze medal position. The <b>second</b> tie <b>breaker</b> was based on which athlete had lifted their weight first and Samadov would have bested eventual winner, Albanian born ethnic Greek Pyrros Dimas by lifting his snatch on his second lift to Dimas' third. At the medal ceremony, Samadov refused to lean forward to accept his medal, instead he took it in his hand, dropped it to the podium and walked away. The International Olympic Committee disqualified Samadov and banned him for life. Samadov apologized the following day but the medal was not awarded, to him or to fourth place Chon Chol-Ho because the disqualification did not happen in the competition. The IOC also would not accept his apology. He was also permanently banned by the sport's governing body.|$|R
60|$|But we {{were nearly}} {{full of water}} again, and not {{more than half a}} mile ahead was the <b>second</b> line of <b>breakers.</b> Again we set to and bailed furiously. Fortunately the storm had now quite gone by, and the moon shone brightly, {{revealing}} a rocky headland running half a mile or more out into the sea, of which this <b>second</b> line of <b>breakers</b> appeared to be a continuation. At any rate, they boiled around its foot. Probably the ridge that formed the headland ran out into the ocean, only at a lower level, and made the reef also. This headland was terminated by a curious peak that seemed not {{to be more than a}} mile away from us. Just as we got the boat pretty clear for the second time, Leo, to my immense relief, opened his eyes and remarked that the clothes had tumbled off the bed, and that he supposed it was time to get up for chapel. I told him to shut his eyes and keep quiet, which he did without in the slightest degree realizing the position. As for myself, his reference to chapel made me reflect, with a sort of sick longing, on my comfortable rooms at Cambridge. Why had I been such a fool as to leave them? This is a reflection that has several times recurred to me since, and with an ever-increasing force.|$|R
50|$|The <b>second</b> year Vancouver <b>Breakers</b> {{were again}} among the contenders {{for the regular}} season title of the {{combined}} W-1 and W-2 leagues.

We consider the bounded number of directions game, in which we designate a finite set of direction-vectors S ⊂ Z d which determines the set of winning lines. We show, by using the Erdős–Selfridge theorem and a modification of a theorem by Beck about games played on almost-disjoint hypergraphs, that for the special case when the coordinates of each direction-vector are bounded, i. e., when S ⊂ {⃗v: ‖⃗v‖ ∞ � k}, Breaker can win this game if the length of each winning line is {{on the order of}} d 2 lg(dk) and d 2 lg(k), respectively. In addition, we show that Maker can build winning lines of length up to (1 +o(1)) dlg k if S is the set of all direction-vectors with coordinates bounded by k. We also apply these methods to the n-consecutive lattice points game on the N d board with (essentially) S = Z d, and we show that the phase transition from a win for Maker to a win for Breaker occurs at n = (d + o(1)) lg N. ...|$|R
5000|$|Brands {{entered the}} Australian Open beating 27th seed Martin Klizan before losing to an in-form Bernard Tomic. In the French Open he drew Rafael Nadal {{in the first}} round. He shocked Rafa, winning the opening set 6-4 with a {{punishing}} serve and huge flat groundstrokes, reminiscent of both Söderling and Rosol, who upset Rafa in the French Open and Wimbledon, respectively. Brands went ahead in the <b>second</b> set tie <b>breaker</b> 3-0, but his level slightly dropped and Nadal's rose. After pulling Nadal off the court with a second serve at 3-2, Brands missed a backhand into the open court that provided the break that Nadal needed to climb back in and win the tiebreaker, 7-4. Brands let down slightly in the next game and was broken {{for the first time}} in the match. Nadal upped his game and won the next two sets 6-4 and 6-3. Nadal was quoted by the New York Times as saying, [...] "I don’t know what he's ranked, but he can’t be ranked 60th playing like that. I can’t believe it.” ...|$|R
60|$|This cry, {{coming from}} his first officer, startled even Captain Crutchely, who was {{recovering}} a little from the effect of his potations, though it was still treated with contempt by the second-mate, who had never forgiven one as young as Mark, for getting a berth that he fancied due to his own greater age and experience. He laughed openly at this <b>second</b> report of <b>breakers,</b> {{at a point in}} the ocean where the chart laid down a clear sea; but the captain knew that the charts could only tell him what was known at the time they were made, and he felt disposed to treat his first officer, young as he was, with more respect than the second-mate. All hands were called in consequence, and sail was shortened. Mark came down to assist in this duty, while Captain Crutchely himself went aloft to look out for the breakers. They passed each other in the top, the latter desiring his mate to bring the ship by the wind, on the larboard tack, or with her head to the southward, as soon as he had the sail sufficiently reduced to do so with safety.|$|R
50|$|Ten years later, Primus's plan to imprison Unicron's spark at {{the heart}} of the sun {{ultimately}} failed, leading the star to collapse, creating a black hole which threatened the existence of Cybertron, and the rest of the universe. Escaping his confinement within the sun, Megatron (now known as Master Megatron in Japan) enhanced his powers by merging his body with the remnants of Unicron's shattered form, increasing his power with the dark god's own. Guided through a spatial warp by the mysterious Soundwave to Gigantion, the Giant Planet, home of the final key, Megatron engaged the world's leader, Metroplex, in battle. Much to his surprise, however, he was utterly defeated in <b>seconds,</b> and Nemesis <b>Breaker</b> was destroyed. Consumed with rage, the power of Unicron within his armor reached out and detected the energies of the Giant Planet's Cyber Planet Key, drawing upon them and infusing Megatron's body with them. Attacking the Autobots in a dark, shadowed form, he decimated most of their forces before being confronted by Optimus Prime and completing his transformation - once again, Megatron had become Galvatron (Master Galvatron in Japan).|$|R
5|$|Next, a small {{metallic}} dingy, {{known as}} an iron yawl, was carried down to the beach. Tom Fagen and Freed Waterhouse manned the yawl, in another attempt to reach the grounded schooner. Through skilled seamanship, they {{made it to the}} <b>second</b> set of <b>breakers,</b> only a short distance from the vessel. When they tried to reach the float line, a large wave struck them leaving their boat filled with water. The two men abandoned their yawl.

When he saw that the yawl had flipped, he swam back to it and straddled the hull. The men on the shore began pulling the flipped boat in, but another wave broke on top of it throwing Waterhouse into the water and righting the yawl. Waterhouse climbed back into the boat and began getting pulled in again, only to be capsized shortly thereafter. This time Waterhouse surfaced, appearing dazed and grasping onto an oar.

50|$|On July 22, 2008, the Lobsters {{played their}} regular-season finale {{on the road}} against the {{defending}} WTT champion Sacramento Capitals. The Lobsters {{found themselves in a}} difficult position on their playoff quest. A victory would have gven them a record of 8-6, and guaranteed them the best record among third-place teams in WTT. However, that would not necessarily be enough to secure the WTT wild card berth. The Capitals, as host of WTT Championship Weekend, were guaranteed the wild card berth if they did not finish first of second in the Western Conference. The Capitals record stood at 6-6, and they were in <b>second</b> place. The <b>Breakers</b> were third at 5-7, and the Lasers were fourth at 5-8. Thus, a Capitals loss would keep the Breakers and Lasers in the hunt for second place in the West. The Breakers held a tiebreaker edge over the Capitals, and the Lasers held a tiebreaker edge {{in the case of a}} three-way tie with the Capitals and Breakers at 6-8. However, a Capitals win coupled with a Breakers loss (to the Sportimes) would guarantee the Capitals second place in the Western Conference and make the wild card available to the best team not finishing first of second in its conference.|$|R

5000|$|Breaker Morant (1980) by Bruce Beresford. A film {{focussing}} {{on one of}} {{the first}} prosecutions for war crimes in British military history - the 1902 court martial of Lieutenants Harry Harbord Morant, Peter Handcock, and George Witton. Set {{at the end of the}} <b>Second</b> Anglo-Boer War, <b>Breaker</b> Morant unfolds during the trial; the acts for which the defendants stand accused are shown in flashbacks. The three defendants are accused of the revenge killing of a Boer prisoner and the summary execution by firing squad of six other Boers after they had surrendered and been disarmed. Furthermore, Lieuts. Morant and Handcock stand accused of murdering the Rev. C.A.D. Heese of the Berlin Missionary Society. Like the defence lawyers at the Nuremberg Trials, the trio's counsel vainly argues that his clients only followed orders. In a 1999 interview, director Bruce Beresford explained, [...] "The film never pretended for a moment that they weren't guilty." [...] He had made the film, he added, to explore how war crimes can be [...] "committed by people who appear to be quite normal." [...] Beresford also lamented that his film still causes many to view Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, and Witton as [...] "poor Australians framed by the Brits." ...|$|R

50|$|The Breakers {{were handed}} a shock loss in their regular season opener, going down 90-71 to the Adelaide 36ers in Adelaide. At half-time, {{the score was}} 51-26 in the 36ers favour. 26 points marked the second lowest first-half score in the club's history, and second biggest halfway deficit. Still without Webster, Abercrombie and Pledger, the Breakers had limited scoring options, with the highest scorer being Cedric Jackson with 14 points. After winning their second {{game of the season}} against the Townsville Crocodiles 89-81 at home, their {{following}} game should have been a celebration of Cedric Jackson's fantastic career with his 100th NBL game being played at the WIN Entertainment Centre against the Illawarra Hawks. However, the Breakers were blown out 96-75 thanks to former club champion Kirk Penney scoring 36 points for the Hawks. Jackson's performance in his 100th game was indicative to the score, as he went 0-of-7 from the field, 0-of-3 from three-point range, and 1-of-5 from the free throw line. The Breakers also committed 25 turnovers, a club record in a 40-minute game. Their following game against the Perth Wildcats also turned in another loss, dropping them to a win/loss record of 1-3 over the first two rounds, having lost all three road games. With a dwindling record, the Breakers were happy to welcome back NBA prospect Corey Webster. The high scoring guard returned to Auckland on 17 October after failing to secure a roster spot with the Pelicans. As a result of Webster returning, forward Duane Bailey was released by the club, while guard replacement Everard Bartlett was retained {{for the rest of the}} season. With Webster back in the line-up, the Breakers went on a three-game winning streak to head into Round 5 with a 4-3 record. On 8 November, the Breakers were defeated by Melbourne United in a controversial final quarter which saw an unsportsmanlike foul call on Webster in the closing <b>seconds,</b> denying the <b>Breakers</b> a chance at stopping United's unbeaten record.|$|R
