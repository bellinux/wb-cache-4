50|$|Beagle 2 has {{a robotic}} arm {{known as the}} Payload Adjustable Workbench (PAW), {{designed}} to be extended after landing. The arm is 109 cm long when fully extended, and it can reach about 70 cm to the nearest rocks. The PAW contains a pair of stereo cameras, a microscope (with a 6 micrometre resolution), a Mössbauer spectrometer, an X-ray spectrometer, a drill for collecting rock samples and a <b>spot</b> <b>lamp.</b> Rock samples were to be passed by the PAW into a mass spectrometer and gas chromatograph {{in the body of}} the lander - the GAP (Gas Analysis Package), to measure the relative proportions of different isotopes of carbon and methane. Since carbon is thought to be the basis of all life, these readings could have revealed whether the samples contained the remnants of living organisms. Atmospheric methane is another signature of existing life, although geological processes can also be a source.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of spot {{lighting}} on performance and welfare in broiler production were investigated. The base performance criterions as body weight, feed conversion and mortality ratio organ weights were determined and also some visceral organ weights (bursa of Fabricius, spleen and liver), Tonic Immobility (TI) and gait score have been evaluated as welfare indicators. Day old chicks from a commercial hatchery divided into three group (n = 174) randomly one {{of them as a}} control and each experimental group separated into three subgroup (n = 58) make replications. In control groups 40 W filament bulbs were used as light source to provide approximately 10 lux light intensity {{on the bottom of the}} poultry house. In the each treatment groups, two halogen <b>spot</b> <b>lamps</b> were used to supply at different light intensities (10 + 10 vs. 10 + 5 lux) over two circular bottom spot of 1 m 2 diameter. Spot light (10 + 5 lux) has shown better (2297. 07 g) live weight than the control groups. Similarly this group shown significantly (p< 0. 05) higher weight or relative weight in bursa of fabricius than the other experimental groups. As a conclusion, spotlights might be useful tool for the dim light applications without negatively affecting the performance and welfare of broilers...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} the present paper is the {{derivation}} of a merit function which predicts the visual perception of LED spot lights. The color uniformity level Usl is described by a linear regression function of the spatial color distribution in the far field. Hereby, the function is derived from four basic functions. They describe the color uniformity of spot lights through different features. The result is a reliable prediction for the perceived color uniformity in spot lights. A human factor experiment was performed to evaluate the visual preferences for colors and patterns. A perceived rank order {{was derived from the}} subjects’ answers and compared with the four basic functions. The correlation between the perceived rank order and the basic functions was calculated resulting in the definition of the merit function Usl. The application of this function is shown by a comparison of visual evaluations and measurements of LED retrofit <b>spot</b> <b>lamps.</b> The results enable a prediction of color uniformity levels of simulations and measurements concerning the visual perception. The function provides a possibility to evaluate the far field of spot lights without individual subjective judgment. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|In {{this work}} {{it was to}} be shown whether dodecaborate cluster-containing {{polymers}} can have possible applications as polymer electrolyte membranes in fuel cells. There are two possibilities to prepare membranes containing dodecahydro-closo-dodecaborate (2 -). On the one hand by polymerization of boron cluster-containing monomers to linear, branched or cross-linked polymers. Or on the other hand by substitution of existing membranes such as Nafion with the B 12 -cluster. It was possible to synthesize a variety of monomers with a [B 12 H 11] 2 - moiety, which some could be polymerized successfully. Radical homo-, co- and photo polymerizations were not successful with boron cluster monomers. Only the photo polymerization of the acrylic acid derivative in the NMR experiment was successful, which might be due to the used <b>Spot</b> <b>Lamps.</b> Cationic polymerizations were also not successful. Also hydrosilylations were no suitable polymerizations for boron cluster-containing monomers. Polycondensation reactions with B 12 H 11 monomers were promising. The reaction of dihydroxybenzylammonioundecahydro-closo-dodecaborate with decafluorobiphenyl showed no starting material in the MS, instead it shows a triply negatively charged peak with a yet unknown structure. With the ring-opening metathesis polymerization bis-norbornene derivatives of the dodecaborate cluster could not be polymerized. However, the mono norbornene derivatives of B 12 H 12 (2 -) formed insoluble swelling polymers in the homo- and copolymerization with dicyclopentadiene and Grubbs 2 nd Generation catalysts. Another method to produce a boron cluster-containing polymer is the substitution of Nafion with the boron cluster. From the obtained polymers, films can be produced, which, however, have no better thermal stability than the pure Nafion membrane. However, investigations whether they are suitable as a membrane material must still be carried out...|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{extremely}} small {{radius of the}} AFM tip, the illumination source is allowed to be focused tighter, thus increasing its efficiency.

40|$|International audienceThe {{transport}} of barium atoms and ions {{in the vicinity}} of the hot <b>spot</b> in fluorescent <b>lamps</b> operating at 25 kHz is investigated by a combined experimental and theoretical approach. By laserinduced fluorescence, the particle densities of barium atoms and ions were measured timeresolved at different distances from the spot center. In addition, the time-dependent cathode fall voltage was measured using an improved band method. The model combines a kinetic part for the electrons with a fluid part for the barium atoms and ions. Both parts are spatially resolved in spherically symmetric geometry. The space-dependent electron Boltzmann equation yields the electron density and the ionization rate coefficient of barium as functions of the cathode fall voltage. These results are used to solve the time-dependent particle balance equations of barium atoms and ions which include the ionization of barium as gain and loss terms, respectively. Good agreement between the measured and calculated particle densities of barium atoms is obtained. A sensitive dependence of the ionization frequency and of the barium particle densities on the cathode fall voltage was found...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple and rapid technique for measuring the action spectra for phototaxis of populations of microorganisms and applied it to halobacteria. A microscope with a dark-field condenser was used to illuminate the cell suspension in a sealed chamber with light of wavelength greater than 750 nm; in this region of the spectrum, the halobacteria show no phototactic response. A 150 -micron spot of light from a xenon arc lamp, whose wavelength and intensity can be varied, was projected through the objective lens {{into the center of}} the dark field. The objective lens imaged this measuring spot through a 780 -nm cut-off filter on an aperture in front of a photomultiplier. The intensity of the scattered 750 -nm light, and therefore the photomultiplier current, is proportional to the number of cells in the measuring <b>spot.</b> A third <b>lamp</b> provided background light of variable wavelength and intensity through the dark-field condenser. To minimize secondary effects due to large changes in cell density, we recorded the initial changes in the photomultiplier current over 1 min after the actinic light had been switched on.

40|$|In this report, we {{describe}} the methodology for 96 parallel organic syntheses of peptides on Teflon-patterned paper assisted by heating with an infra-red <b>lamp.</b> <b>SPOT</b> synthesis is an important technology for production of peptide arrays on a paper-based support for rapid identification of peptide ligands, epitope mapping, and identification of bio-conjugation reactions. The major drawback of the SPOT synthesis methodology published to-date is suboptimal reaction conversion due to mass transport limitations in the unmixed reaction spot. The technology developed in this report overcomes these problems by changing {{the environment of the}} reaction from static to dynamic (flow-through), and further accelerating the reaction by selective heating of the reaction support in contact with activated amino acids. Patterning paper with Teflon allows for droplets of organic solvents to be confined in a zone on the paper array and flow through the paper at a well-defined rate and provide a convenient, power-free setup for flow-through solid-phase synthesis and efficient assembly of peptide arrays. We employed an infra-red (IR) lamp to locally heat the cellulosic support during the flow-through delivery of the reagents to each zone of the paper-based array. We demonstrate that IR-heating in solid phase peptide synthesis shortened the reaction time necessary for amide bond formation down to 3 minutes; in some couplings of alpha amino acids, conversion rates increased up to fifteen folds. The IR-heating improved the assembly of difficult sequences, such as homo-oligomers of all 20 natural amino acids...|$|R
