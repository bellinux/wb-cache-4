5|$|Kanhopatra advises against seeking mere sexual pleasure; she <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> {{the evils}} of sexual attraction, citing mythological {{characters}} who suffered the consequences of sexual temptation: the demon-king Ravana, the demon Bhasmasura, the god-king of heaven Indra and the moon-god Chandra.|$|E

5|$|Rishabhanatha is also {{mentioned}} in Buddhist literature. It <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> several tirthankara and includes Rishabhanatha along with: Padmaprabha, Chandraprabha, Pushpadanta, Vimalanatha, Dharmanatha, and Neminatha. A Buddhist scripture named Dharmottarapradipa mentions Rishabhanatha as an Apta (Tirthankara).|$|E
5|$|According to Reuven Firestone, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of groups of Jews venerating Ezra to an extent greater than mainstream Judaism, which fits with the interpretation that the verse merely <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> a small group of Jews. The book 2 Esdras, a non-canonical book attributed to Babylonian captivity, associates a near-divine or angelic status to Ezra. Mark Lidzbarski and Michael Lodahl have also hypothesized existence of an Arabian Jewish sect whose veneration of Ezra bordered on deification.|$|E
5|$|Before {{turning to}} the {{district}} court's rulings, we must acknowledge a certain awkwardness in deciding whether the Act encompasses the Tribe without considering {{at the same time}} whether the Act encompasses the controverted land transactions with Maine. Whether the Tribe is a tribe within the Act would best be decided, under ordinary circumstances, along with the Tribe's specific land claims, for the Act only <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> tribes {{in the context of their}} land dealings.|$|E

30|$|In modern day, euphemisms {{are often}} used {{intentionally}} to deceive or manipulate others. Rather than <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> economic recessions, politicians <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> minus growth; rather than <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> military attacks, they <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> missions (Burkhardt, 2010); rather than bribes, they <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> soft commissions (Rittenberg, Gladney, & Stephenson, 2016). Such Orwellian double-speak lives {{not only in the}} lexicons of politicians, but also the everyman. If we cannot afford to buy a new car, we buy a pre-owned car rather than a used car; if we cannot afford to fly first class, we fly coach rather than second class (Burkhardt, 2010).|$|R

5|$|Bouckman: Bouckman is of Jamaican {{origin and}} leads the secret {{gathering}} of trusted slaves, where he <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> French requests for freedom for black slaves, {{but also of}} the resistance displayed by plantation landowners. He is present when staff is named and an uprising is planned. After the uprising is defeated, Bouckman is killed at the same location as Macandal is burned alive.|$|E
5|$|Shiva – The main {{character}} in the story. He is a Tibetan immigrant to Meluha and {{the chief of the}} Guna tribe. On arriving in Meluha and consuming the Somras (a potion), his throat turns blue making him the Neelkanth of the Meluhan legend, which <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> the appearance of Neelkanth as a destroyer of evil. The Meluhans end up believing that Shiva would be their saviour.|$|E
5|$|The ballad <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> the Wabash River, which {{flows through}} Indiana, and reminisces about events that {{occurred}} there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.|$|E

5|$|According to Jagdish Narain Tiwari and Dilip Chakravati, the Matrikas were {{existent}} {{as early}} as the Vedic period and the Indus Valley civilization. Seals with rows of seven feminine deities or priestesses are cited as evidence for the theory. The Rigveda (IX 102.4) <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> a group of seven Mothers who control the preparation of Soma, but the earliest clear description appears in select chapters of the epic Mahabharata dated to 1st century AD. Wangu believes that Matrika description in Mahabharata is rooted in the group of seven females depicted on Indus valley seals. It was assumed that the people locally worshipped these goddesses, such an example is also described in Zimmer Heinrich book The Art Of Indian Asia, about the seven shrines of seven Mother Goddesses worshipped locally.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Roman Empire, Barbarians plundered the region around Klis. First it was ruled by Odoacer, and then by the Theodoric the Great, after he {{eliminated}} Odoacer, and set up an Ostrogothic Kingdom. After Justinian I fought an almost continual war for forty years to recover the old Roman Empire, he seized Dalmatia, and Klis was from 537, a part of Byzantine Empire. The name of Klis (Kleisa or Kleisoura) was first described in chapter 29 of Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus' De Administrando Imperio. While describing the Roman settlement of Salona, Constantine VII <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> the stronghold, which may have been designed or improved, to prevent attacks on the coastal cities and roads by Slavs.|$|E
5|$|After {{thinking}} {{a bit more}} about Emile and deciding she has become attracted {{on the basis of}} little knowledge of him, Nellie tells the other nurses that she intends to end her relationship with him ("I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair"). When he arrives unexpectedly and invites Nellie to a party where he will introduce her to his friends, however, she accepts. Emile declares his love for Nellie and asks her to marry him. When she mentions politics, he <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> universal freedom, and describes fleeing France after standing up against a bully, who died accidentally as the two fought. After hearing this, Nellie agrees to marry Emile. After he exits, Nellie joyously gives voice to her feelings ("I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy").|$|E

5|$|Ancient {{and modern}} historians {{provided}} different estimations {{for the number}} of ships and troops under the command of Basiliscus, {{as well as for the}} expenses of the expedition. Both were enormous; Nicephorus Gregoras <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> one hundred thousand ships, the more reliable Cedrenus says that the fleet that attacked Carthage consisted of eleven hundred and thirteen ships, having each one hundred men on board. The most conservative estimation for expedition expenses is of 64,000pounds of gold, a sum that exceeded a whole year's revenue.|$|E
5|$|Close {{to the end}} of the war, H.D. met {{the wealthy}} English novelist Bryher (Annie Winifred Ellerman). They lived {{together}} until 1946, and although both took numerous other partners, Bryher remained her lover for the rest of H.D.'s life. In 1919, H.D. came close to death when she gave birth to her daughter Frances Perdita Aldington—although the father was not Aldington, but Gray—while suffering from war influenza. During this time, her father, who had never recovered from Gilbert's death, died. In 1919, H.D. wrote one of her few known statements on poetics, Notes on Thought and Vision, which was unpublished until 1982. In this, she <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> poets (herself included) as belonging to a kind of elite group of visionaries with the power to 'turn the whole tide of human thought'.|$|E
5|$|If {{ever there}} was a book {{calculated}} to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E

5|$|In 1835, Smith {{encouraged}} some Latter Day Saints in Kirtland {{to purchase}} rolls of ancient Egyptian papyri from a traveling exhibitor. Over {{the next several}} years, Smith worked to produce what he reported was a translation {{of one of these}} rolls, which was published in 1842 as the Book of Abraham. The Book of Abraham <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> the founding of the Abrahamic nation, astronomy, cosmology, lineage and priesthood, and gives another account of the creation story. The papyri from which Smith dictated the Book of Abraham were thought to have been lost in the Great Chicago Fire. However, several fragments were rediscovered in the 1960s, were translated by Egyptologists, and were determined {{to be part of the}} Book of the Dead with no connection to Abraham.|$|E
5|$|Less {{relevant}} is {{the other}} 6th-century source, Jordanes' Romana. Of Gothic ancestry, Jordanes served as a notarius for a Byzantine Master of the Soldiers before entering {{into the ranks of}} the Catholic clergy and writing his two surviving books, the Romana and the Getica. The latter is a summary of Gothic history, while the lesser known Romana is an abridged account of Roman history written in 551 or 552. According to James O'Donnell, the two works share a pessimistic view of human life in which all secular accomplishments are insignificant compared to religious goals. Jordanes does not explicitly mention Thurisind in the Romana, but <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> the third Lombard–Gepid War, in which Thurisind participated, in the last passages of the work.|$|E
5|$|Logging {{remained}} {{a mainstay of}} industry in Missoula with the groundbreaking of the Hoerner-Waldorf pulp mill in 1956, which resulted in protests over the resultant air pollution. An article in Life magazine thirteen years later <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> Missoulians sometimes needing to drive with headlights on during the day to navigate through the smog. In 1979, still almost 40% of the county's labor income came from the wood and paper products sector. The lumber industry was hit hard by the recession of the early 1980s, and Missoula's economy began to diversify. By the early 1990s, the disappearance {{of many of the}} region's log yards, along with legislation, had helped clean the skies dramatically.|$|E
