5|$|Recorded dietary {{items include}} sago shoots and insects, {{and it also}} {{swallows}} small stones to help break up its food. It is apparently monogamous, but little else is known of its courtship behaviour. The only known nest was a <b>shallow</b> <b>bowl</b> {{in the top of}} a rotting tree stump that was lined with wood chips and dry leaves. The two young chicks were entirely covered in black down typical of precocial newly hatched rails. The estimated population of 3,500–15,000 birds and the restricted range mean that the invisible rail is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Habitat loss has occurred through the harvesting of sago and conversion of the wetlands to rice cultivation, and the rail is eaten by local people. The described nest was in an area frequented by local villagers, so the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought.|$|E
25|$|During LH IIIA1, {{there are}} many stylistic changes. Most notably, the Mycenaean goblet begins to {{lengthen}} its stem and have a more <b>shallow</b> <b>bowl.</b> This stylistic change {{marks the beginning of}} the transformation from goblet to kylix. The vapheio cup also changes into an early sort of mug and becomes much rarer. Also during this period, the stirrup jar becomes a popular style and naturalistic motifs become less popular.|$|E
25|$|The Powder River basin {{is shaped}} like a large <b>shallow</b> <b>bowl,</b> with its westernmost rock {{formations}} lying against the Big Horn Mountains. As these mountains uplifted over eons of geologic time they lifted and tilted the sedimentary rocks from the Powder River basin, which were then eroded away, creating the plains that stretch eastward from the mountains into the basin. Generally there are older sedimentary layers closer to the mountains and younger layers farther away.|$|E

25|$|The grave also {{contained}} {{an assemblage of}} imported objects from Italy and the Greek world, all of them associated with the preparation of wine. They included the famous krater (see below), a silver phiale (<b>shallow</b> <b>bowl,</b> sometimes seen as a local product), an Etruscan bronze oinochoe (wine jug), and several drinking cups from Etruria and Attica. One of the latter was dated as c. 525 BC and represents the latest firmly dated find in the grave. It thus provides the best evidence, a terminus post quem for its date. The vessels probably were placed on wooden tables or benches that did not survive.|$|E
25|$|Pottery making can {{be found}} {{in many parts of the}} state, but the two best-known centers are San Bartolo Coyotepec and Santa Maria Atzompa. Most of Oaxaca’s pottery is made without potters’ wheels, instead done with the use of molds or formed by hand, {{sometimes}} using a kind of “proto-wheel”, which is a plate or <b>shallow</b> <b>bowl</b> place over an inverted bowl. Ceramics are one of Oaxaca’s best known handcrafts in Mexico. The most common glazed pieces include those with base colors of brown and white, shaped into vases, plates, cups and decorative pieces. For utilitarian pieces, molds are most commonly used. For very large pieces such as cantaros other storage containers, the molding is done in sections.|$|E
2500|$|During the Geometric and Archaic phases, the {{production}} of large metal vessels was an important expression of Greek creativity, and an important stage {{in the development of}} bronzeworking techniques, such as casting and repousse hammering. Early sanctuaries, especially Olympia, yielded many hundreds of tripod-bowl or sacrificial tripod vessels, mostly in bronze, deposited as votives. [...] These had a <b>shallow</b> <b>bowl</b> with two handles raised high on three legs; in later versions the stand and bowl were different pieces. During the Orientalising period, such tripods were frequently decorated with figural protomes, in the shape of griffins, sphinxes and other fantastic creatures.|$|E

2500|$|Pair {{formation}} {{begins in}} fall, and nest building begins in spring. [...] The female builds a well-concealed nest {{on the ground}} below dense vegetation, especially Eragrostis variabilis bunchgrass. [...] The nest is a <b>shallow</b> <b>bowl</b> lined with dead grass and down feathers. [...] Egg-laying typically occurs from April to August. [...] Average clutch size on Laysan Island is approximately four eggs. [...] The newly established population on Midway lays larger clutches, presumably because of better availability of food. [...] Ducklings are precocious and feed on their own day two after hatching, but are guarded, brooded, and led to foraging sites by the hen for approximately 40 to 60 days.|$|E
2500|$|However, one vessel type used in food {{preparation}} was closely {{linked with the}} spread of Roman culture and Roman cuisine: the [...] This was a robust <b>shallow</b> <b>bowl</b> with a thick, out-curved rim that {{made it easy to}} handle, often a pouring lip, and an internal surface deliberately roughened with a coating of grit or coarse sand during manufacture. It was used with a pestle to purée or pulverise ingredients in order to prepare elaborate and carefully seasoned Roman dishes; the Roman culinary tradition made extensive use of herbs and spices. The mortarium was the Roman equivalent of the food-processor, and is a real indicator of 'romanisation'; In Britain, the first mortaria were being imported from Gaulish sources more than a generation before Britain became a Roman province in AD 43, indicating the growing influence of Roman culture in late Iron Age southern Britain, and perhaps the actual presence of immigrants from Gaul. Later, locally-made mortaria produced at specialised potteries in different areas of the province were available throughout Britain, in addition to imported products: Paul Tyers discusses mortaria from no fewer than 16 different manufacturing sources, Romano-British and Continental, that have been found in Britain. Like so many other specialised Roman ceramic products, many mortaria also bore workshop or makers' stamps on their rims, and noting their chronology and distribution can help archaeologists understand trading patterns and the Roman economy.|$|E
2500|$|South Gaulish samian {{typically}} has a redder {{slip and}} deeper pink fabric than Italian sigillata. [...] The best slips, vivid red and of an almost mirror-like brilliance, were achieved during the Claudian and early Neronian periods (Claudius, reg. AD 41–54; [...] Nero, reg. AD 54–68). [...] At the same period, some workshops experimented briefly with a marbled red-and-yellow slip, a variant that never became generally popular. [...] Early production of plain forms in South Gaul initially followed the Italian models closely, {{and even the}} characteristic Arretine decorated form, Dragendorff 11, was made. [...] But many new shapes quickly evolved, and by {{the second half of}} the 1st century AD, when Italian sigillata was no longer influential, South Gaulish samian had created its own characteristic repertoire of forms. The two principal decorated forms were Dragendorff 30, a deep, cylindrical bowl, and Dragendorff 29, a carinated ('keeled') <b>shallow</b> <b>bowl</b> with a marked angle, emphasised by a moulding, mid-way down the profile. [...] The footring is low, and potters' stamps are usually bowl-maker's marks placed in the interior base, so that vessels made from the same, or parallel, moulds may bear different names. [...] The rim of the 29, small and upright in early examples of the form, but much deeper and more everted by the 70s of the 1st century, is finished with rouletted decoration, and the relief-decorated surfaces necessarily fall into two narrow zones. [...] These were usually decorated with floral and foliate designs of wreaths and scrolls at first: the Dr.29 resting on its rim illustrated in the lead section of this article is an early example, less angular than the developed form of the 60s and 70s, with decoration consisting of simple, very elegant leaf-scrolls. [...] Small human and animal figures, and more complex designs set out in separate panels, became more popular by the 70s of the 1st century. [...] Larger human and animal figures could be used on the Dr.30 vessels, but while many of these have great charm, South Gaulish craftsmen never achieved, and perhaps never aspired to, the Classical naturalism of some of their Italian counterparts.|$|E

60|$|It was, of course, {{like that}} {{only in their}} fond remembrance, {{but this was not}} the only Roman quality in their cup of {{pleasure}} that day; and they did not care to inquire whether it was merely the flavoring extract of fancy, or was a genuine infusion from the Italian sky overhead, the classic architectural forms, the loosely straggling grass, the flowering woods, the rapture of the birds, the stretches of the river, the tumbling rapids, which so delicately intoxicated them. There was a certain fountain gave a peculiar authenticity to their pleasure, as of some assurance blown in the bottle from which their joy-draught was poured. Nowhere else but in Rome could they have imagined such a group of bronze men and maidens and web-footed horses struggling so bravely, so aimlessly (except to show their figures), in a <b>shallow</b> <b>bowl</b> from which the water spilled so unstintedly over white marble brims beginning to paint themselves palely green.|$|E
