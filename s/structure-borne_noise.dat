A test apparatus has been designed, built and calibrated {{for the purposes of}} studying propeller-induced, <b>structure-borne</b> <b>noise</b> transmission in prototypical aircraft structures. The principal approach to the test apparatus design was to provide a physical means of separating the airborne and <b>structure-borne</b> <b>noise</b> components so that the <b>structure-borne</b> <b>noise</b> transmission response could be studied directly without airborne noise contamination.

They have an excellent mechanism to effectively increase fuel efficiency and engine power, but they unfortunately cause several noise problems. Its noise are mainly classified as <b>structure-borne</b> <b>noises,</b> generated from the vibration of rotating shaft modules (cartridges), and air-borne noises, from air flow inside turbochargers or their coupling ducts. In this study an attempt to reduce the pulsation noise generated from the compressor wheels, whose frequency {{is the same as}} the whine noise is presented. This attempt is based on using the compact high frequency side branch resonators to develop low intake noise system. The design of such system, which is mainly based on the developed 1 D linear acoustic theory and theoretical investigations to use more than one resonator connected to the main duct in series and/or in parallel are introduced. An optimization strategy to choose the appropriate resonator axis offset is presented. In case of complex unsymmetrical geometry in real resonators, a 3 D finite element is used. The presented models are validated via comparison with the measured results at room temperatures. The validated models are used to improve the acoustic performance of the real resonators. Based on the developed models and the optimization results, the internal design of resonators improves its acoustic performance; the serial arrangements increase the damping at the same peak frequency while the parallel arrangements make it wider. The amount of extra damping added to the intake system depends on the resonators geometry and their axis offset which can be around 50 dB a...|$|R
40|$|<b>Structure-borne</b> tyre/road <b>noise</b> is an {{important}} component of the perceived noise annoyance of passenger cars. More in particular, it was observed that crossing road surface discontinuities (e. g. concrete road surface joints, railroad crossing, potholes, …) causes a significant increase in instantaneous exterior noise level. In addition, it has an adverse effect on the interior vehicle NVH in the sense that the passengers experience high-amplitude transient noise and vibrations. Therefore, an extensive research programme was established at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, K. U. Leuven, to study <b>structure-borne</b> tyre/road <b>noise</b> due to road surface discontinuities. As part of the research activities, an original test setup for impact tyre/road noise was developed so that rolling tyre vibrations, radiated noise and dynamic spindle forces could be measured at different rolling speeds. The test setup is based on the tyre-on-tyre principle and a cleat is used to reproduce a road surface discontinuity. This paper concentrates on the data processing techniques used to experimentally obtain the modes of a rolling tyre. Since the forces introduced by the cleat cannot me measured, Operational Modal Analysis was selected as processing technique. A major challenge is the requirement to obtain spatial information on the tire from a single-point measurement device. Therefore, a dedicated triggering and time-domain averaging procedure was elaborated. The purpose of averaging is obviously to reduce random noise whereas triggering is required to be able to correlate different tyre locations that have not been measured at the same time (a singlepoint Laser Doppler Vibrometer was used). status: publishe...|$|R

Typical frequency range for environmental ground vibrations is 1 - 200 Hz. Waves of lower frequencies (below 1 Hz) are usually called microseisms, and they are normally associated with natural phenomenae, e.g. water waves in the oceans.

40|$|The tire dynamic {{transfer}} stiffness {{describes how}} a displacement enforced at the tire contact patch {{results in a}} force at the spindle-wheel interface. The dynamic transfer stiffness is expressed {{as a function of}} frequency and provides insight in the generation of vehicle interior <b>structure-borne</b> tire/road <b>noise.</b> The road surface texture excites the tire at the contact patch, resulting in structural waves travelling around the circumference of the tire. The tire sidewalls transfer these vibrations to the rim. The vibrational energy is then transmitted through the spindle-wheel interface toward the suspension and vehicle body. The resulting body panel and window vibrations cause noise radiation in the passenger compartment. It is known that the tire dynamic properties are dependent on the vibration amplitude. Therefore, the excitation levels during tire dynamic characterization tests should be similar as the excitation levels during operation of the tire. This is not possible with the classic excitation devices such as hammer and electrodynamic shakers. This paper presents an experimental method to obtain the dynamic transfer stiffness of a non-rolling tire which is excited at operational excitation levels. Therefore, a high-frequency 6 -DOF hydraulic shaker table (CUBE R ○) is used to excite the tire. The shaker table provides the static preload and excites the tire at the contact patch in the frequency range 20 - 235 Hz.

First, a laboratory test bench consisting of a wheel/suspension/lower suspension A-arm assembly has been developed {{in order to identify}} the vibro-acoustic transmission paths (up to 250 Hz) for realistic road noise excitation of the wheel. Frequency Response Function (FRF) measurements between the excitation/control electrodynamic shakers and each suspension/chassis linkages are used to characterize the different transmission paths that transmit energy through the chassis of the car. Secondly, a FE/BE model (Finite/Boundary Elements) was developed to simulate the acoustic field of an automobile cabin interior.

Finally, an implemented optimal active control algorithm using a feedforward structure to perform the simulation of an optimal active structural acoustic control (ASAC) by using experimental and numerical FRFs is presented. The control approach relies on the use of an electrodynamic actuator to modify the vibration behavior of the suspension and the automotive chassis such that its noise radiation efficiency is decreased. To predict the noise level reduction inside the passenger compartment, the measured FRFs of a control actuator, connected to the lower suspension A-arm, have been implemented by using the optimal active control algorithm in MATLAB ª.

40|$|The {{acoustic}} pressures {{developed in}} a boundary layer can interact with an aircraft panel to induce significant vibration in the panel. Such vibration is undesirable due to the aerodynamic drag and <b>structure-borne</b> cabin <b>noises</b> that result. The overall objective of this work is to develop effective and practical feedback control strategies for actively reducing this flow-induced structural vibration. This report describes the results of initial evaluations using polynomial, neural network-based, feedback control to reduce flow induced vibration in aircraft panels due to turbulent boundary layer/structural interaction. Computer simulations are used to develop and analyze feedback control strategies to reduce vibration in a beam as a first step. The key differences between this work and that going on elsewhere are as follows: that turbulent and transitional boundary layers represent broadband excitation and thus present a more complex stochastic control scenario than that of narrow band (e. g., laminar boundary layer) excitation; and secondly, that the proposed controller structures are adaptive nonlinear infinite impulse response (IIR) polynomial neural network, {{as opposed to the}} traditional adaptive linear finite impulse response (FIR) filters used in most studies to date. The controllers implemented in this study achieved vibration attenuation of 27 to 60 dB {{depending on the type of}} boundary layer established by laminar, turbulent, and intermittent laminar-to-turbulent transitional flows. Application of multi-input, multi-output, adaptive, nonlinear feedback control of vibration in aircraft panels based on polynomial neural networks appears to be feasible today.
