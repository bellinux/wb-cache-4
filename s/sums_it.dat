Bhattacharyya <b>sums</b> <b>it</b> this way: [...] "The growing importance of Shaktism [...] brought them into greater prominence and distributed their cult far and wide.

Maier writes that this understanding {{is not limited to}} the language used, but also actions; this includes holding hands in public and drinking lemonade, activities which traditional Indonesian society does not involve. Student Hidjo also contrasts Dutch and Javanese peoples. Maier finds that, through its alternating events, the novel shows that the Dutch and Javanese are incompatible; Maeir <b>sums</b> <b>it</b> up as [...] "Javanese do not feel at ease in Holland, [...] Dutch do not feel at ease in Java." [...] According to Maier, the novel views the gap between the two cultures as [...] "unbridgeable".|$|E

In a September 2010 interview, Seppälä defines their music: [...] "Amberian Dawn's music is melodic metal, and the roots lie in the Metal and Rock music of the 70s and 80s and maybe {{a little bit of the}} '90s.

2500|$|In a 2014 {{review for}} Uncut, Richard Williams said {{that just as}} the Beatles' fan-club Christmas records were {{inspired}} by the Goons, Harrison's inspiration for Electronic Sound {{appears to have been}} [...] "another BBC institution of their formative years: the Radiophonic Workshop".

He concluded by saying that the self-deprecating sleeve note from Arthur Wax [...] "still <b>sums</b> <b>it</b> up". Scott Elingburg of PopMatters welcomed its Apple Years reissue and described the album as the artist's [...] "most 'experimental' work" [...] and, like the remastered Wonderwall Music, [...] "raw and gorgeous, alive and capable of sparking ingenuity". He said that while Harrison was [...] "no Brian Eno or Jeff Lynne" [...] in terms of synthesizer innovation, [...] "the intention behind Electronic Sound is one of exploration and discovery, an artist limbering up his musical mind to discover how far the boundaries of modern instrumentation could take him. Out of context, Electronic Sound would sound maudlin, even dull. Here, as a key step in the progression of Harrison the solo artist, it sounds audacious in its primitiveness ..." ...|$|E

6000|$|The Gary Schools {{and many}} of the new schools are public schools. And the {{principle}} of the new education that the state is primarily responsible for the health of pupils--because an unsound body is apt to make an unsound citizen of backward intelligence--is now being generally adopted by public schools all over the country. This idea is essentially an element of the democratic contention that all citizens must be given an equality of opportunity--though all may not be created equal--now becoming a positive rather than a negative right, guaranteed by the state itself. An earnest attempt is thus made by the state to give every citizen a fair start that in later years he may have no ground for discontent or complaint. He stands on his own feet, he rises in proportion to his ability and industry. Hence the program of the British Labour Party rightly lays stress on education, on [...] "freedom of mental opportunity."
