40|$|Pathological {{changes that}} {{develop in the}} hip joints (HJ) have {{different}} origins and mechanisms of development, but their main manifestation is pain. The nature of this pain cannot be well established on frequent occasions. The English-language medical literature currently classifies such disorders as greater trochanter pain syndrome (GTPS). Its major signs are chronic pain and local palpatory tenderness in the outer part of HJ. The development of GTPS {{may be associated with}} inflammation of the <b>synovial</b> <b>bursae</b> situated in the greater tronchanter, as well as with tendinitis, myorrhexis, iliotibial band syndrome, and other local changes in the adjacent tissues or with systemic diseases.

40|$|The pain {{syndrome}} holds {{a central}} {{position in the}} clinical picture of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Articular inflammation is an essential, but not the only, factor that determines the occurrence of pain. Extraarticular soft tissue pathology {{can play an important}} role in the formation of pain perceptions in RA. The pain that increases on movement with involvement of affected structures, as well as local tenderness on palpation and dysfunction of an altered segment are the major clinical manifestations of extraarticular soft tissue involvement in RA. Swelling in the area of appropriate tendons and <b>synovial</b> <b>bursae</b> can be seen when superficially located anatomic formations are involved. Magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography permit more accurate determination of the site and pattern of an involvement. The pain and functional impairments associated with extraarticular soft tissue pathology determine a need for additional therapy that can correct the existing disorders and improve the quality of life in patients. The major components of this treatment are sparing routine and systemic and local drug therapy. Diclofenac sodium is one of the most universal agents that allow simultaneous monitoring of various pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease. Local glucocorticoids may be used if the sparing routine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs fail to control the pain syndrome effectively...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Multiple bony loose {{bodies in}} the subacromial space caused form {{cartilage}} or bone cells and continue to grow. Presentation of case: A 58 -year-old man with two-year history of swelling and pain of the right shoulder. He had no history of tuberculosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Magnetic resonance (MR) images showed some bony loose {{bodies in the}} subacromial space. The removal of loose bodies and bursa debridement were performed arthroscopically. Histological diagnosis of them was synovitis with fibrous bodies. Discussion: Extra-articular loose bodies is extremely rare, especially in the subacromial space, which maybe originated in the proliferative <b>synovial</b> <b>bursa.</b> Most authors recommend open removal to relive the pain, but there were choice to apply arthroscopy to remove them. Conclusion: The mechanism of formation of bony loose bodies is not clear, {{may be associated with}} synovial cartilage metaplasia. Arthroscopic removal of loose bodies and bursa debridement is a good option for treatment of the loose body in the subacromial space, which can receive good function...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Lipoma arborescens is a rare, tumor-like lesion {{commonly}} involving synovial {{joints and}} less commonly <b>bursae</b> and <b>synovial</b> tendon sheaths. Case Outline. We report {{a case of}} a 12 -year-old boy with symmetric involvement of the bicipitoradial <b>bursae,</b> <b>synovial</b> sheaths of extensor compartments of both hands and medial ankles. The diagnosis of polyarticular lipoma arborescens was proposed on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and this diagnosis was histologically proven after biopsy of the bursae and later by open surgery of the synovial sheath of the right ankle tendons. Literature search was performed and twelve cases with polyarticular involvement were analyzed. Lipoma arborescens commonly involves suprapatellar recess of the knee and very rarely other joints or bursae. Histological analysis revealed an accompanying non-necrotizing granulomatous synovial inflammation. Conclusion. Polyarticular lipoma arborescens is a rare entity and symmetrical involvement of the joints other than the knees is exceedingly rare.

40|$|Introduction: Synovial chondromatosis {{is a rare}} benign {{condition}} {{arising from}} the synovial membrane of the joints, <b>synovial</b> sheaths or <b>bursae</b> around the joints. Primary synovial chondromatosis typically affects the large joints in the third to fifth decade of life, although involvement of smaller joints and presentation in younger age group is also documented. The purpose of this case report is to document this rare synovial pathology especially in an adolescent age group, which required open synovectomy and debridement to eradicate it. Metaplastic growth from the marginal synovium fixed to the adjacent cartilage was atypical feature in this case, which {{to the best of}} my knowledge has not been reported earlier. Case Report: A sixteen year old boy presented with one year history of pain, swelling and restriction of left knee joint. After the clinical and radiological assessment open synovectomy, removal of loose bodies and thorough joint debridement procedure was performed. Histopathological study confirmed the findings of synovial chondromatosis. Conclusion: Synovial chondromatosis is a rare benign condition very rarely seen in adolescent age group. Metaplastic growth arising from marginal synovium was an atypical feature which is occasionally seen. Complete synovectomy offers reliable cure rate...|$|R
50|$|A {{rheumatoid}} nodule {{is a local}} swelling or tissue lump, usually rather firm to touch, like an unripe fruit, which occurs almost exclusively in association with rheumatoid arthritis. Very rarely {{rheumatoid nodule}}s occur as rheumatoid nodulosis {{in the absence of}} arthritis. They are usually subcutaneous especially over bony prominences such as the olecranon (tip of the elbow) or the interphalangeal joints (finger knuckles). Less commonly they occur in the lining of the lung and other internal organs. The occurrence of nodules in the lung of miners exposed to silica dust was known as Caplan's syndrome. Nodules vary in size from that of a lentil or pea to that of a mandarin orange. Quite often they are associated with <b>synovial</b> pockets or <b>bursae.</b> About 5% of rheumatoid arthritis patients have such nodules within two years of disease onset, and the cumulative prevalence is about 25%. In the great majority of cases nodules are not painful or disabling in any way, being more of an unsightly nuisance, but in some cases they can be painful, especially if the overlying skin breaks down. Rarely, the nodules occur at diverse sites on body (e.g. upper eyelid, distal region of the soles of the feet, vulva and internally in the gallbladder, lung, heart valves, larynx, and spine).|$|R
40|$|Bursa is fluid-filled sac {{filled with}} a small amount of liquid called <b>synovial.</b> <b>Bursa</b> is located in many places in the body mostly between bones and the tendons and muscles near joints. The bursa reduces {{friction}} and eases the movement between the bones, tendons and other tissues. The biggest bursas are located between tendons and bone, usually over the large joints such as shoulder, elbow, hips and knees. Bursitis is inflammation of a bursa and itcan be caused by various factors such as: trauma (repetitive movements), infection, deposition of microcrystals. Acupuncture as part of the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), is very often used in the treatment of bursitis. In the research are included 30 patients, 18 male and 12 female, on age from 18 to 71, treated with acupuncture for shoulder bursitis. Acupuncture treatments were made in a clinic for TCM and acupuncture, on room temperature, with normal and fire needles, on certain trigger points - Ashi.

The treatment with fire needle showed better and faster results in the treatment of shoulder bursitis...|$|E
40|$|Adventitious bursae {{typically}} {{develop in}} areas of chronic frictional irritation, usually under bony prominences. Although adventitious bursae are generally well understood, there is a paucity of data on effects of bursae underlying chronic wounds in neuropathic patients. This manuscripts reviews 4 clinical cases, each with a neuropathic patient with adventitious bursae underlying chronic nonhealing wound and strategies for treatment. The Wound Healing Society defines chronic ulcerations as wounds that have “failed to proceed through an orderly and timely process to produce anatomic and functional integrity, or proceeded through the repair process without establishing a sustained anatomic and functional result. ” 1 Chronic wounds resulting in indolent ulcers are similar in that each is characterized by 1 or more persistent inflammatory stimuli: repeat trauma, ischemia, or bacterial contamination. 2 These wounds place a great burden both on the individual and {{on the health care}} system, with the conservative cost of treatment estimated at $ 20 billion per year in the United States alone. 3 It has been the experience of the authors of this article that adventitious bursae formation {{has been found to be}} another contributing source to delaying the healing process of a chronic foot wound when all other measures to promote healing were accounted for. ADVENTITIOUS BURSAE There are 2 different types of bursae that have been described; these are <b>synovial</b> <b>bursa</b> and adventitious bursa. Synovial bursae are called such as they are synovial-lined structures that function to decrease friction and shear between 2 moving structures. 4 These bursae develop during weeks 20 to 40 of development over areas where some degree of motion is required between skin, tendon, and bony structures. Adventitious bursae develop postpartum and arise from friction and pressure in superficial fibrous connective tissue in locations where the skin must move freely over subcutaneous bony surfaces. 5,...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Peripheral {{arthritis}} {{has been}} described in up to 50 % of PMR patients, with knee involvement in the majority. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate by PET/CT the knees of patients with PMR and GCA and to identify the knee structures involved by inflammation. METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients with PMR (19) or GCA (6) were studied in comparison with 25 age- and sex-matched controls who underwent PET/CT for initial staging of cancer. Clinical features, ESR and CRP were evaluated. Simultaneous FDG-PET and CT imaging from the skull base to the knee was performed after injection of 4. 8 - 5. 2 MBq of [(18) F]FDG per kilogram body weight. The knee anatomical structures being evaluated included joints, fibrous capsule, <b>synovial</b> recesses and <b>bursae.</b> RESULTS: At PET/CT, 21 / 25 patients (84 %) showed bilateral diffuse uptake at the knees. The tracer clearly outlined the contour of the fibrous capsule. In 50 knees, 90 % of capsular sites were involved by inflammation in comparison with 23 % of intracapsular sites and 4. 7 % of extracapsular sites (P < 0. 0001). No correlation was found between PET/CT results and ESR or CRP. FDG uptake, with a pattern similar to that observed in 96 % of PMR/GCA patients, was seen in 20 % of controls (P = 0. 03). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that bilateral capsulitis of the knee is detectable in most PMR/GCA patients if a sensitive imaging technique such as PET/CT is used...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the MRI {{findings in the}} various forms of pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) of the foot. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven hundred and fifty-three MR studies of the foot performed at our institute between June 1994 and April 2000 were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of PVNS. Spin echo (SE) T 1 W, Gradient echo (GE) T 2 *W, and fat suppression (Short Time Inversion Recovery: STIR) images were acquired with a 0. 5 T superconductive unit (Vectra, GE Medical System, Milwaukee, WI, USA) provided with a dedicated transmitter/receiver coil. The site and type of lesions, the signal intensity patterns, and the presence of associated changes were evaluated. RESULTS: On the basis of the MR images and the above parameters, six patients (3 men, 3 women, age range: 35 - 48 years) with PVNS were selected. Three out of six PVNS were nodular, whereas the remaining three were diffuse. Of the three nodular forms, one was found in the sub-talar joint and the remaining two antero-medially to the talus. Instead, all of the diffuse lesions were located on the metatarsus. Perilesional oedema was seen in all cases, although more obvious in the nodular forms, whereas bone involvement (osteochondral erosion) was observed only in the diffuse metatarsal PVNS. Intra-articular bloody effusion was never observed. The MRI findings were confirmed by surgery in all cases. DISCUSSION: The high contrast resolution and multiplanar capabilities of MRI allow the complete evaluation of the structures of the foot affected by PVNS, and of the extent of soft tissue (<b>bursae,</b> <b>synovial</b> or nervous structures), bone and articular involvement. Although not specific, the presence of haemosiderin results in characteristic MR findings, due to the shortening of both T 1 and T 2 relaxation times. GET 2 * images are particularly well suited to this PURPOSE: Furthermore, in our experience, FIR images added better depiction of associated swelling. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, MRI is now the most reliable technique for identifying and classifying PVNS, and allows correct treatment planning and effective monitoring...|$|R
