40|$|ABSTRACT: The mean grain size. sorting, and {{skewness}} of a {{sedimentary deposit}} {{are dependent on}} the sediment grain size distribution of its source and the sedimentary processes of i) winnowing (erosion), ii) selective deposition of the grain size distribution i transport, and iii) total deposition of the sediment in transport. If a source sediment undergoes erosion, and the resultant sediment in transport is deposited completely, the deposit must be finer, better sorted, and more negatively skewed than the source. This trend {{is referred to as}} Case I. The lag remaining after erosion, on the other hand, must be coarser, better sorted, and more positively skewed (Case ll). If sediment in transport undergoes selective deposition, the resultant deposit can either be finer (Case IlIA) or coarser (Case nlB) than the source, but the sorting will be better and the skew more positive, Although exceptions to these trends may occur, they suggest that comparison of one sediment must be made with another for the proper identification of the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>process,</b> and therefore it is not possible for a single grain-size distribution to identify the depositional environment. The trends also suggest that the skewness of a grain-size distribution has been widely misinterpreted and implies neither the truncation of one of the tails nor the mixing of more than one mode. Rather, a skewed sediment is the natural result of the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>process.</b> In a system of related environments, these trends can be used to identify both the probable source and the probable deposit and. by inference, the net sediment transport paths among sedimentary deposits. Such an analysis provides a rapid understanding of the sedimentary processes, identifies patterns of erosion and accretion, and may suggest transport processes...|$|E

Our study focuses {{on the case of}} Lanice conchilega, a tube-building ecosystem engineer whose aggregations impact <b>sedimentary</b> <b>processes.</b> This polychaete forms biogenic tube aggregations distributed on the coasts of the northern hemisphere from the shallow intertidal to depths of 1900  m.

This study evaluates the relationships between intertidal L. conchilega aggregations and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>processes</b> at the intertidal zone of a sandy beach in northern France. Three experiments were executed to investigate (1) the effects of L. conchilega presence on <b>sedimentary</b> <b>processes,</b> as well as (2) the impacts of sedimentation on L. conchilega survival and patch growth, and (3) assess small-scale spatial heterogeneity in density and ecosystem engineering in L. conchilega aggregations. Weekly estimations of sedimentary properties in-situ showed that net deposition is significantly higher inside L. conchilega aggregations than in bare sand; whereas sediment mixing depth is noticeably reduced in comparison and regardless of patch tidal height. Variations in tube density above 3200 ind m - 2 did not significantly impact sedimentary properties suggesting that the relationship between flow attenuation and tube density is nonlinear. In-situ monitoring of L. conchilega aggregations revealed different temporal trends for tube density and EPS content at the sediment surface between the center and edges of patches. This hints at the presence of environmental gradients within aggregations that may cause small-scale spatial heterogeneity. Finally, laboratory experiments showed significantly higher mortality rates and tube building activity in the presence of sediment deposition between 5 cm and 12 cm in column height. Results are in agreement with previous research suggesting that a positive feedback between sedimentation and tube-building activity drives the vertical expansion of patches. However, vertical expansion may be limited by deposition-induced mortality, thereby controlling population abundance...|$|R
40|$|Lacustrine {{sediment}} sequences {{can provide}} valuable archives of past environmental and climatological variability in terrestrial realms. In order {{to unravel the}} history of a lake and of a lake’s catchment, a profound understanding of the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>processes</b> is required. This encompasses the supply of allochthonous organic matter, nutrients and clastic material to the lake, the subsequent redistribution within the lake as well as autochthonous organic matter and mineral deposition. These lake internal and external processes are closely linked to the environmental and climatological settings in the specific area and can be reconstructed by using geophysical and sedimentary data. Within the scope of this thesis, modern and past <b>sedimentary</b> <b>processes</b> of selected lakes from the High Artic (Lake El’gygytgyn, NE Siberia) and the Mediterranean Realm (lakes Dojran and Ohrid, Balkan Peninsula) were analyzed by using various datasets and analytical methods. The obtained information about variations in the lakes’ internal and external processes were subsequently used for paleoenvironmental and -climatological reconstructions in the respective area. At Lake El’gygytgyn, modern <b>sedimentary</b> <b>processes</b> were investigated by using geochemical, grain-size and mineralogical data from source rocks, inlet streams and surface sediments. The obtained informa- tion about modern <b>sedimentary</b> <b>processes</b> improved the understanding of hydro-acoustic and downhole logging data, as well as of variations in the granumoleric, geochemical and physical properties of core 5011 - 1 which covers the entire lacustrine succession of the 3. 58 Ma year old Lake El’gygytgyn. Surface samples and downcore data were analyzed by using statistic methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Redundancy Analysis (RDA), Time Series Analysis and Cluster Analysis. At Lake Dojran, hydro-acoustic data and sediment properties (water content, OM, calcite (CaCO 3) content, sulfur content, grain-size, XRF scanning, δ 18 Ocarb, δ 13 Ccarb, δ 13 Corg) of a 7 m long sequence were used to untangle past <b>sedimentary</b> <b>processes</b> and environmental variations during the Late Glacial and Holocene period. Sediment (lithostratigraphic description, XRF scanning, water content, OM content, calcite content) and hydro-acoustic data were also used to characterize a 2 m thick Mass Wasting Deposit (MWD) in Lake Ohrid. As various analytical and statistical methods were used to investigate modern and past <b>sedimentary</b> <b>processes</b> in the selected lakes, an evaluation of these methods is conducted within the scope of this thesis. It could be shown that information about modern <b>sedimentary</b> <b>processes</b> derived from lacustrine surface samples and from catchment samples can help to better understand past <b>sedimentary</b> <b>processes</b> as it provides insights into spatial variations in the deposition processes. Spatial variations of past <b>sedimentary</b> <b>processes</b> and the overall sediment architecture of lacustrine deposits can be analyzed using hydro-acoustic data. However, the vertical resolution of hydro-acoustic data is limited and the data commonly lacks a robust chronology. Chronostratigraphic well constrained and high resoluted informa- tion about past <b>sedimentary</b> <b>processes</b> can be derived from sedimentary properties of a sediment core. These properties include lithologic information such as sediment structure, grain-size, and inorganic and organic geochemistry. These proxy data can be obtained by visual core descriptions and laboratory analyses. However, certain proxies can commonly only be used to reconstruct a specific part of sedi￼mentary processes, for example grain-size data yields information about the transport energy during the deposition. Thus, a combination of multiple proxies is required to reconstruct the overall picture of sedi- mentary processes. If huge data sets are used for the reconstruction, statistic methods such as PCA, RDA, Time Series Analyses, and Cluster Analyses can help to simplify the data. However, it could be shown that mathematic methods can provide results that might lead to misinterpretations in a geological context. In order to interpret sediment sequences for paleoenvironmental and -climatological variations in a temporal context, an age model is commonly established by using for example radiocarbon ages and chronological tie points derived from tephrostratigraphic or paleomagnetic data. Cross correlation to well dated sediment sequences or wiggle matching to orbital parameters can improve a chronostrati- graphic modell. However, this involves the danger of misinterpretations or loss of information about the timing of geologic or climatic events...|$|R

Such usage presents the challenge of having to establish the initial and boundary conditions that will cause the model's output o match present-day observations. This constitutes an inversion problem that can sometimes be handled by traditional optimization methods. Clastic sedimentation models, however, often incorporate complex non-linear relationships that preclude the use of these techniques. The problem must then be handled statistically by relaxing the requirement of honouring exact observations and matching only the spatial variability of the observed deposits. Recent advances in control of non-linear dynamic systems may also shed light on possible solutions to the inversion problem in siliciclastic models. This paper reviews known approaches to problems related to input uncertainty and conditioning, and presents original preliminary results on control of sedimentation models...|$|E

Two types can be differentiated: fluvial runoff events caused by precipitation that carried sediment in suspension into the lake and a sediment mass transport caused by torrential precipitation.

40|$|The present-day Lesina area (Adriatic {{coast of}} {{southern}} Italy) preserves in the subsurface the stratigraphic signature {{of a recent}} <b>sedimentary</b> <b>process</b> regime change, which {{was responsible for the}} conversion of a former alluvial plain into a back-barrier tidal flat and, finally, into the modern barrier island. Facies-based analyses of the first 55 m of the upper Pleistocene–Holocene stratigraphic record, integrated with biostratigraphic sampling, radiocarbon data, and aerial observations of some diagnostic relict morphologies, allowed us to reconstruct the history of the last 20, 000 years of this area. The succession investigated is adjacent to a salt dome, which uplifted in recent times, forming the easternmost boundary of the present-day Lesina lagoon. Three main stratigraphic intervals were detected in the subsurface: the lowermost unit is made up of conglomerates, sandstones, and mudstones of terrestrial origin, belonging to a complex system of alluvial plain filling a pre-existing Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) topography. The second interval consists of sands and muds, with subordinate conglomerates of brackish and marine origin, and lies on the previous one through a wide ravinement. Its composing lithofacies exhibit a strong tidal signature preserved in tidal rhythmites belonging to a net of tidal channels, associated with marshes, mud flat, and lagoonal deposits. These sediments record the emplacement of a back-barrier tidal flat, which developed under the strong influence of a tidal influx enhanced by the late post-LGM transgression. The third uppermost interval resulted from the deposition of coastal-marine sands and gravels accumulated during the ensuing modern normal regression, under the dominance of a wave-dominated coastal dynamics, which was responsible for the progradation of the present-day beach barrier and the closure of the Lesina lagoon. The paleogeography of the back-barrier tidal flat preceding the onset of the modern barrier island is thus reconstructed {{based on the results of}} our facies analysis, biostratigraphy, and AMS dating. Many of the elements composing this mid-Holocene tide-influenced system were also interpreted from the aerial-photograph observation of several relict morphologies, which are still preserved in many parts of the modern Lesina barrier island.
