The solid missile motor grain with cracks is very {{dangerous}} when it is lunched, because the <b>surface</b> <b>cracks</b> might be propagation unstable when the internal pressure enters the <b>surface</b> <b>cracks</b> cavity. In order to analyze the <b>surface</b> <b>crack</b> of solid motor grain, with accelerated aging test, the variation law of mechanics properties of propellant in the storage period is obtained. Under internal pressure and axial acceleration loading, the three-dimension finite element models of the motor grain are established, three-dimension singular crack elements at the tips of <b>surface</b> <b>cracks</b> are established to simulate the cracks propagation. Along with the <b>surface</b> <b>crack</b> propagation, the stress intensity factors of the crack tips in different storage period are calculated to prejudge its stability respectively.

If the <b>surface</b> <b>cracks</b> are detected early, we can avoid costly repairs to the structures and damages to structures and human life.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{reports the}} recent {{development}} of a <b>surface</b> fatigue <b>crack</b> detection technique based {{on the use of}} surface-mount piezoelectric paint sensor. Polymer-based piezoelectric paints that can be directly deposited onto the surface of host structures are being utilized to make the sensor for <b>surface</b> <b>crack</b> detection. Because of its electromechanical coupling properties, voltage signals can be generated by the piezoelectric paint sensor when subjected to mechanical strain in its film plane. Results from recent development of the piezoelectric paint-based <b>surface</b> <b>crack</b> detection technique indicate that piezoelectric paint sensors with a special electrode design can potentially provide an effective method to detect fatigue cracks occurring in structural surfaces. A simple damage index is defined to determine the occurrence of <b>surface</b> <b>cracks</b> in a pre-specified region. However, complex sensor electrode patterns may be necessary in some cases to improve the spatial resolution of <b>surface</b> <b>crack</b> detection. Experiments conducted to validate this <b>surface</b> <b>crack</b> detection technique are also described in this study...|$|R

50|$|In 2014, {{researchers}} {{noted that}} the librational motion of Mimas has a component that cannot be explained by its orbit alone, and concluded that {{it was due to}} either an interior that is not in hydrostatic equilibrium (an elongated core) or an internal ocean. However, in 2017 it was concluded that an ocean would lead to surface tidal stresses comparable to or greater than those on tectonically active Europa. Thus, the lack of evidence for <b>surface</b> <b>cracking</b> or other tectonic activity on Mimas argues against the presence of such an ocean. Since formation of a core would likely have led to formation of an internal ocean in the past, probably leading to geologic activity, this explanation for the libration is also problematic. The presence of an asymmetric mass anomaly associated with the crater Herschel is another possible explanation for the libration.|$|E
