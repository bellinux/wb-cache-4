50|$|A {{mixture of}} {{aliphatic}} and alicyclic C7 to C12 hydrocarbons, white spirit {{is used as}} an extraction solvent, as a cleaning solvent, as a degreasing solvent and as a solvent in aerosols, paints, wood preservatives, lacquers, varnishes, and asphalt products. In western Europe about 60% of the total white spirit consumption is used in paints, lacquers and varnishes. White spirit is {{the most widely used}} solvent in the paint industry.

40|$|Use {{of fluid}} N–P or N–P–K starter {{mixtures}} in most research studies precludes firm conclusions about specific starter K effects on early crop growth and grain yield. This study evaluated corn (Zea mays L.) early growth, early plant K concentration and uptake, and grain yield response to <b>fluid</b> <b>starter</b> K fertilizer. Eight trials were conducted during 2007 and 2008 in Iowa farmers’ fields using a strip trial methodology, global positioning systems, yield monitors, and geographical information systems. Six sites were managed with chisel–plow tillage and two with no–tillage. Soil–test K (STK) {{was measured using}} a dense grid sampling approach (0. 13 –to 0. 4 –ha cells). Treatments replicated three times were a control, commercial fluid K 2 CO 3 starter (0 – 0 – 25 N–P–K) applied in the seed furrow at 14 to 21 kg K ha− 1, broadcast K at 112 kg K ha− 1, and broadcast K plus starter K. Means from {{the entire length of}} the strips showed that K fertilization did not affect early plant dry weight (DW) or K uptake consistently, but increased K concentration at most sites and increased grain yield at three sites. At two sites broadcast K increased yield more than starter K, and at one site both fertilizers increased yield similarly. Sites with plant DW or K uptake responses did not show a yield response. Starter K in addition to broadcast K did not increase yield further. Analyses of plant measurements by soil series or areas with STK in various STK interpretation classes for each field did not show consistent differences in responses to starter or broadcast K. Overall, the results showed that starter K seldom increased early corn DW or K uptake and the infrequent increases seldom resulted in increased grain yield. Starter K applied in addition to broadcast K rates commonly applied by farmers did not increased yield further...|$|R

5000|$|Overall, {{response}} was mostly positive. Glen Diaz of BuddyTV called the situation [...] "harrowing" [...] and said, [...] "The {{return to the}} NCIS headquarters was fascinating and sort of unreal, but all ended up well in the end. Then again, we know there's got to be no way that NCIS will split this team up - although I did have a scary moment there when Abby (Pauley Perrette) said she felt that Ziva {{was no longer in}} their universe." [...] Sarah Lafferty from Starpulse.com noted, [...] "Vengeance has always been the fuel for team Gibbs as well as a strong unrelenting theme of the show." [...] Lafferty added, [...] "'NCIS' season premieres NEVER disappoint. Even if it all goes down in only the last 15 minutes of the episode...The show doesn't hold without Ziva. I was as unsettled as Tony, Abby, McGee, and Gibbs were in the flashbacks.

50|$|In cold weather, {{high speed}} diesel engines can be {{difficult}} to start because the mass of the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression, preventing ignition due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio. Pre-chambered engines make use of small electric heaters inside the pre-chambers called glowplugs, while direct-injected engines have these glowplugs in the combustion chamber. Many engines use resistive heaters in the intake manifold to warm the inlet air for starting, or until the engine reaches operating temperature. Engine block heaters (electric resistive heaters in the engine block) connected to the utility grid are used in cold climates when an engine is turned off for extended periods (more than an hour), to reduce startup time and engine wear. Block heaters are also used for emergency power standby Diesel-powered generators which must rapidly pick up load on a power failure. In the past, a wider variety of cold-start methods were used. Some engines, such as Detroit Diesel engines used a system to introduce small amounts of ether into the inlet manifold to start combustion. Others used a mixed system, with a resistive heater burning methanol. An impromptu method, particularly on out-of-tune engines, is to manually spray an aerosol can of ether-based engine <b>starter</b> <b>fluid</b> into the intake air stream (usually through the intake air filter assembly).|$|E
5000|$|In February 1991, in {{woodland}} near Medford, Oregon, USA, two hikers {{came across}} the burning body of a female adult, lying face down in fallen leaves. They alerted the officials and a local deputy sheriff soon arrived. The victim was described as [...] "well nourished". She had been stabbed {{several times in the}} upper regions of the chest and back. Both arms were spread outwards from the torso. The lower legs and surface of the neck showed signs of fire damage. The soft tissues of the right arm, torso and upper legs were consumed. The majority of bones of these parts retained their integrity, although friability was increased. Between mid-chest and knees the fleshy parts of the body were mostly destroyed. Crime scene personnel reported that the pelvis and spine were [...] "not recoverable", having been reduced to a grey powder. Her killer had soaked the clothes and corpse in nearly a pint of barbecue <b>starter</b> <b>fluid</b> and set her on fire. In the well-oxygenated outdoor environment, this combination of circumstances—an immobile and clothed body with a high fat-to-muscle ratio, accelerant (lighter fluid), and artificial ignition—made it prime for the wick effect to occur. The murderer was arrested and made a full confession. He claimed to have set the body alight some thirteen hours before it was discovered.|$|E

40|$|Methamphetamine, a. k. a. speed, crank or meth, is {{the fastest}} growing drug threat in America. It is inexpensive, easily made from readily {{obtainable}} chemicals and has a longer lasting effect than cocaine. Methamphetamine is highly addictive and can cause violent and psychotic behavior, according to the White House Office of Drug Control Policy. Side effects include convulsions, dangerously high body temperature, cardiac arrhythmia and stroke. State Action Precursors. Methamphetamine is manufactured using common household ingredients (pre-cursor chemicals). Producers usually use cold medicines as the main component. Other items used to “cook ” meth include chemicals derived from drain cleaners, lithium batteries, lantern fuel and <b>starter</b> <b>fluid.</b> Because the materials used to manufacture the drug are readily available, states have taken measures to regulate and criminalize these precursor substances. Last year, Indiana established an education program to help retailers recognize who may be purchasing chemicals for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine.

Oklahoma requires manu-facturers and wholesale distributors to keep, for three years, records of who purchases precurso...|$|E
