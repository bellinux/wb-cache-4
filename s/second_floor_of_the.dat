Closer to the epicenter, several instances of damage were aligned with the highest observed intensity. The structural effects to the gas station's walls and roof at Casa de Fruta, the beam damage on the <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ford's department store in Gilroy, and the caved-in roof from the fallen parapet at the law office in Hollister were all considered by the United States Geological Survey to be consistent with intensity VII (Very strong) shaking.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow {{moved to}} Cambridge {{to take a}} job at Harvard College as Smith Professor of Modern Languages and of Belles Lettres.
