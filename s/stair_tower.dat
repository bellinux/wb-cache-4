5|$|The outward {{appearance}} of the Zytglogge {{is determined by the}} 1770 renovation. Only the late Gothic cornice below the roof and the <b>stair</b> <b>tower</b> are visible artifacts of the tower's earlier history.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, the Zytglogge {{and the other}} Bernese gate towers were {{extended}} and decorated after the Burgundian Romantic fashion. The Zytglogge received a new lantern (including the metal bellman visible today), four decorative corner towerlets, heraldic decorations and probably its <b>stair</b> <b>tower.</b> The astronomical clock was extended to its current state. In 1527–30, the clockwork was completely rebuilt by Kaspar Brunner, and the gateway was overarched to provide a secure foundation for the heavy machinery.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{is built}} in the 13th century English Gothic style in coursed ragstone with a red-tiled roof and a central wooden belfry, topped by a splayed-foot spire and small dormers at the west end. The plan is of an aisle-less nave with a lower chancel, north chapel and south porch with a <b>stair</b> <b>tower</b> for the gallery (all at {{the west end of}} the church), with a sacristy linking it to the presbytery in the {{north-east}} corner. The windows are of Bath stone.|$|E

5|$|The square Little <b>Stair</b> <b>Tower</b> was the {{entrance}} from the bailey to the withdrawing rooms {{south of the}} great hall. At ground floor level there was a doorway {{in each of the}} tower's faces. Directly south of {{the east side of the}} tower was the castle's chapel. The northern door led to the great hall, and the western door to a cellar under the great chamber. There are only fragmentary remains of the spiral staircase. Above the passageway was a single room, of uncertain purpose: it may have been used as another chapel, a guest room, or an antechamber where guests would wait before being admitted into the earl's presence.|$|E
5|$|The central {{range was}} begun around 1500, {{possibly}} as a two-storey building containing a great hall, although only fragments {{of this building}} remain. The south entrance to the tower house was blocked up, and replaced with a ground floor entrance from the east. A new <b>stair</b> <b>tower,</b> with a broad spiral stair, was built at the south-east corner. Originally topped by a conical roof, this stair gave access to the upper floors in the tower, and to the central range. Around 1570, the 4th Earl of Morton rebuilt the block, extending it further south to form new apartments. This block, forming the present three-storey central range, includes a vaulted kitchen and cellar in the basement, with suites of rooms above. The two bedrooms {{on the first floor}} each have their own closets and garderobes, or privies. The west apartment is accessed from the terraced garden, via another stair to the south-west, and has a private stair which led up to another chamber above, suggesting that these were the Earl and Countesses apartments. The upper storey, whose timber floor is now missing, comprised three more apartments, including one over the stair. The exterior of the block is decorated with a horizontal decorative strip of masonry known as a string course. One first-floor window is decorated with carved stone pilasters and strapwork, in a similar style to windows at Edinburgh Castle and Drochil Castle, in the Borders, both of which were built under Morton's Regency.|$|E
25|$|Abbey of Saint-Pierre de Rillé. It was {{originally}} a collegiate church of Augustinian regular canons. It {{was founded in}} 1143 and {{in the seventeenth century}} became the Abbey of Sainte-Geneviève. It was rebuilt once between 1724 and 1750, and again in the 19th century. Of the former building, visible in its entirety on the 1756 plan, it remains the only <b>stair</b> <b>tower</b> topped by an imperial roof.|$|E
25|$|The entrances are at {{the base}} of the <b>stair</b> <b>towers.</b> They are {{openings}} sheltered by a bracketed metal portico that echoes the station's roof-line. Pedestrian traffic on the sidewalks can continue through.|$|R
50|$|Common {{exclusions}} to {{the total}} calculation of square footage {{for the purpose of}} floor area ratio (FAR) include unoccupied areas such as mechanical equipment floors, basements, <b>stair</b> <b>towers,</b> elevator shafts, and parking garages.|$|R
50|$|On {{each corner}} {{there is a}} tower with a {{diameter}} of seven meters (22 feet). On the court yard front there are two <b>stair</b> <b>towers</b> which form the only connection between the floors.|$|R
25|$|The {{name comes}} from greenstone, a rock found in great {{quantity}} in the area, from which the gold that led to Yellowknife's development was extracted. The building reflects that past in two other ways. Its interior <b>stair</b> <b>tower</b> is sided in slanted boards that recall the mineshaft towers still standing, {{and the location of}} a prominent local fault beneath the building is marked on the lobby floor.|$|E
25|$|Haggs Castle is {{an altered}} L-plan tower, of 4 storeys. The main block {{measures}} around 17m by 7.2m. The vaulted basement contained two chambers and a {{kitchen with a}} large fireplace. The main stair {{led up to the}} first floor, where a private room was located behind the main hall. Smaller corbelled stairs led to the upper storeys, which included a square caphouse above the <b>stair</b> <b>tower.</b> Square and round gun loops were located around the tower. The most striking feature is the carved decoration, including cable-moulded string courses, moulded corbels, and the carving over the door.|$|E
25|$|The castle was not {{repaired}} until 1667, when it {{was again}} used as a prison, holding a number of Covenanters; religious rebels who opposed the King's interference in church affairs. The south tower was rearranged, with a bakehouse installed in the basement, and a new <b>stair</b> <b>tower.</b> Further changes were made in 1693, when the spur was heightened with a wall-walk, and the north tower was reduced to provide three gun platforms overlooking the Forth. After the Union of Scotland and England in 1707, the castle {{ceased to be a}} prison, instead being one of four Scottish fortresses to be maintained and garrisoned by the British Army, the others being Stirling, Dumbarton and Edinburgh. The garrison at Blackness numbered around fifteen men in the late 18th century. Between 1759 and 1815 Blackness was again pressed into service as a prison, this time to hold French prisoners of war during the series of conflicts of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, including the Seven Years' War and the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

50|$|The {{impressive}} eastern {{facade of}} the central wing flanked by its four storeyed <b>stair</b> <b>towers</b> and surmounted by a fleche, sits above the sweeping grounds and is visible from Lutwyche Road. The main entrances are on the eastern faces of the <b>stair</b> <b>towers</b> where wide <b>stairs</b> lead to ornamented arched openings {{on the first floor}} level. The uppermost level of the towers have bullseye windows and openings supported by colonettes. The two further sets of stairs on the front elevation lead to the verandah and feature bullseye windows. Rear entrance, from the playground, is via stairs in the north east and south east corners placed at 45 degrees to the facades.|$|R
50|$|A major safety upgrade project, {{funded by}} the Colorado State Historical Fund, was started in 2001 and {{completed}} in 2009. The design by Fentress Architects added modern safety features, like enclosed <b>stair</b> <b>towers,</b> that {{blend in with the}} original architecture.|$|R
25|$|C deck was {{the highest}} deck within the ship's hull. Third class cabins were in the {{starboard}} bow section, and the third class dining room was opposite of the cabins. After the third class area were more first-class cabins, terminating at a <b>stair</b> <b>tower.</b> Aft of the stairwell were second-class berths without private bath facilities, and aft of the second-class rooms was a sheltered promenade. B deck consisted mostly of public space. The first class and tourist class dining areas were both located amidships, separated by the ship's galley. The first class dining saloon was lit with fluorescent lights and equipped with apparatus to minimize sensation of the roll of the ship. The second-class dining area {{was similar to the}} first-class area, but not as lavish, and also doubled as the ship's cinema. The bow section of B Deck had more third-class accommodations and the third-class ship entrance. A deck had mostly crew's quarters, storage rooms, and had the ship's engines. There were also third class cabins in the bow. Notably, Cambodges original steam turbine engine never suffered significant breakdowns and never had to be replaced.|$|E
500|$|In 1351, Sir William Douglas {{gave the}} lands of Aberdour to his nephew, Sir James Douglas of Dalkeith, {{although}} he retained the castle for himself until his death two years later. The grant was confirmed by King David II in 1361. In 1386 Aberdour and Dalkeith were combined to form a single barony, with the principal seat at Dalkeith, near Edinburgh, and Aberdour as a secondary residence. James, fourth Lord Dalkeith, succeeded to the joint barony in 1456, and was created Earl of Morton in 1458, prior to his marriage to Joanna, the [...] daughter of James I. The newly created earl expanded the existing hall house, heightening and rebuilding the structure to suit his elevated status. The second earl carried out extensions to Aberdour Castle around 1500, building a new <b>stair</b> <b>tower</b> and south block.|$|E
500|$|Historically, Royton's only {{landmark}} was Royton Hall, the township's former {{manor house}} which was inhabited by local dignitaries from its construction (in {{as early as}} the 13th century) to 1814. Part of the hall was erected during the 16th century, but the east wing was crafted in the Elizabethan or Jacobean architectural style. In 1794 it was described as [...] "pleasantly seated in a deep valley, surrounded by high grounds. It is a firm, well built stone edifice of ancient date". During the First World War, Royton Hall was used to house Belgian refugees, and following the war was bought by Dr John Thomas Godfrey. After he took his family to South Africa, it stood empty until it was converted into flats. The hall fell into disrepair in the 1930s and was demolished in 1938. The foundations of the structure were excavated in 2005 leading to the discovery of original panes of glass and a Tudor <b>stair</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both <b>stair</b> <b>towers</b> {{are faced}} {{entirely in the}} rusticated stone. Each has a single narrow double-pane {{casement}} window on each storey, facing south. A single narrow concrete course runs above the first and fourth storeys. The towers have the same red cornice at the roofline.|$|R
50|$|The south parking deck {{is faced}} with {{distinctive}} twisted concrete slabs on the upper four levels, with the twist alternating in direction from floor to floor. The first floor is clad in red brick, and two red brick <b>stair</b> <b>towers</b> are located on {{the south and west}} sides.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the rear}} is a [...] curved curtain wall between two engaged flat-roofed <b>stair</b> <b>towers,</b> {{connecting}} the far corners of both sections. It {{is made of}} glass with photovoltaic cells inside. A small secondary entrance portico {{is located in the}} center. At the building's southeast corner is an emergency exit.|$|R
500|$|The Art Deco-style interior, {{meant to}} evoke a 1920s Hollywood style, {{featured}} mahogany woodwork, tile floors and chandeliers. The inside also contained Spanish-style white stucco, spiral staircases and wrought iron features including stair rails, built-in cabinetry door and window hardware and lighting fixtures. The house included a basement pool (which eventually closed due to water leaks), a stone fireplace [...] in width, and small square windows. Also {{in the basement}} were the furnace, a storage room, and spaces for laundry and billiards. The main floor housed the garage, a kitchen and breakfast bay, the living and dining rooms and a music room. The master bedroom was adjacent to a deck above the dining and music rooms at {{the southwest corner of}} the property. Fireplaces and hallway floors featured brown ceramic tile; black glazed ceramic tile was used in the master bathroom, while black, red and yellow tiles were used in the breakfast bay. One of the castle's bathrooms was said to be modeled on Charlie Chaplin's. The interior was arranged around a central <b>stair</b> <b>tower</b> capped with a conical roof clad in copper. Chimneys vented the centrally located furnace and rose from fireplaces in the house's west hall.|$|E
500|$|An {{avenue of}} oak trees runs up Lennie Hill from the Grotto Bridge. At the summit, Hope-Weir had an {{ornamental}} temple built in 1759, commanding wide {{views of the}} expanded estate and beyond. Craigiehall Temple was a circular two-storey structure, with a <b>stair</b> <b>tower</b> at the rear and a pedimented portico on the front. The segmental pediment bears {{the arms of the}} 1st Marquess of Annandale, and so predates the temple. In The Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh, it is suggested that this portico may have formed part of a gate to the forecourt of the house. If so, it may have been made by Alexander McGill, to a design by John Erskine, Earl of Mar. It was incorporated into the temple, which was again to the design of one of the Adam brothers. A Latin inscription on the temple, again from Horace, can be translated as [...] "live happy while you can among joyful things". The structure was burned by vandals in the early 1970s, and in 1977 the upper storey was removed as a hazard to aviation, following {{the development of a new}} longer runway at nearby Edinburgh Airport. The remaining storey was renovated, and now forms part of a private house.|$|E
2500|$|The Amtrak 30th Street Parking Garage was {{designed}} by BLT Architects and completed in 2004. This nine-level, double helix garage provides 2,100 parking spaces and glass-enclosed <b>stair</b> <b>tower</b> and elevator to offer views of Philadelphia. [...] The following year (2005) the Arch Street Pedestrian Bridge was completed and designed with contribution from BLT Architects. The Arch Street Pedestrian Bridge provides direct access for pedestrians from 30th Street Station to the parking garage and Cira Centre; this prevents pedestrians from interacting with heavy traffic from PA 3 and I-76.|$|E

50|$|The building's {{inverted}} pyramidal shape {{helps in}} keeping the building cool in summer and warm in winter. The ground floor comprises only 2025 sq ft of reception space, while the second floor is 5625 sq ft and the third floor 10000 sq ft. The council chambers are in a semi-buried basement level. The building is flanked by free-standing fire <b>stair</b> <b>towers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The mill {{itself is}} an L-shaped four story {{building}} with two <b>stair</b> <b>towers</b> {{in the late}} Second Empire style, with corbeled brickwork and cast iron detailing. The original timber framing {{has been replaced by}} reinforced concrete on the lower stories. The east tower has a clock face in one dormer and a 1500 lb bell, cast by Jones & Co. of Troy.|$|R
2500|$|The remodel brought ample {{exterior}} {{space to}} the house. [...] Matching porches extended into {{the front and rear}} yard {{on either side of the}} north-facing, vertical entry and <b>stair</b> <b>tower.</b> Both porches were terminated in a broad stair between elongated planting piers. Aside from additional planters below the living room window and outside the stairway window, the yard was simply landscaped. A low concrete wall topped by a similarly short wrought iron fence was incorporated sometime after construction to enclose the yard along the south and east lot lines. [...] This fence continued along the eastern edge of Nathan Moore's property to the corner of Forest Avenue and Superior Street. The sidewalk at the front entrance was demarcated by Roman brick piers topped by glass-globed light fixtures. The yard additionally featured an original ticket booth from the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition which Moore had purchased and relocated to the site.|$|E
2500|$|The five-storey Central Tower, or [...] "main mast", {{was built}} in the 15th century and {{heightened}} in the 16th. It measures around , and the walls are [...] thick at the base. Each storey contains a single large room with a fireplace, a garderobe or privy, and numerous chambers within the walls. The storeys were originally linked by a narrow spiral stair, until a larger <b>stair</b> <b>tower</b> was constructed at the east corner in the 17th century. The castle's more important prisoners were held here. Men such as Cardinal Beaton, Archbishop of St Andrews and James V's ambassador to France, and Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, regent of Scotland in the 1520s, would have had a reasonably high standard of living, including their own servants, while in prison. The basement is vaulted, and the roof is also built on a stone vault. The parapet was rebuilt in the 20th century, although the course of projecting corbels on which is stands is original. Outside the tower is a well.|$|E
2500|$|The castle {{is today}} entered from the south, via a modern portal {{complete}} with a portcullis. Above the door is a Gaelic inscription which in translation reads: [...] "As {{long as there is}} a Macrae inside, there will never be a Fraser outside", referring to a bond of kinship between the two clans, and a similar inscription which once adorned the Fraser's home at Beaufort Castle. Above this is carved the coat of arms of John Macrae-Gilstrap. The portal gives access to the courtyard, the level of which has been lowered exposing the bedrock around the tower house. The present buildings at the south-east of the castle reflect the form of the earlier structures, including the circular <b>stair</b> <b>tower,</b> but are larger in extent. To the south-west only the southern portion of the L-shaped block was reconstructed, as a plain three-storey house, while in place of the northern wing is an open platform giving views over the loch. [...] A small tower occupies the north-west angle. The keep itself follows the original dimensions, though the formerly subdivided ground floor is now a single room: the tunnel-vaulted Billeting Hall. Above on the first floor is the Banqueting Hall with an oak ceiling, and decorated with coats of arms and 15th-century style fireplace. The main ceiling beams in the Banqueting Hall are of Douglas Fir and were shipped from British Columbia, Canada as a gift from the Macraes of Canada. Small mural chambers within the walls are accessed from each hall.|$|E
50|$|St. Joseph's Academy, 70 North Swan Street. This four-story brick building, {{dating to}} 1905, has {{sections}} articulated by its fenestration and <b>stair</b> <b>towers</b> on its east (front) facade. Its parapet and water table are limestone; the {{windows on the}} fourth floor are arched with a brick course connecting them at the springline. It is currently used as a youth center.|$|R
50|$|A chapel {{existed on}} the site from 1821, {{enlarged}} in 1840, then further enlarged and rebuilt between 1862 and 1865 in an Italianate style under local architect J. Hartland and Son. The {{front of the building}} has evidence of redevelopment rather than a complete rebuild, with one of the <b>stair</b> <b>towers</b> projecting beyond the main facade and the four upper windows appearing off-centre when viewed from inside.|$|R
50|$|The organ {{was built}} by Schlag & Söhne of Wurttemberg, Germany. It was modernized by J.H. Jørgensen of Oslo in 1967. The altarpiece depicts Christ in prayer and was {{designed}} in 1894 by Marcus Grønvold. The church tower is {{the highest in the}} city at 61 m. The main <b>tower</b> has four <b>stair</b> <b>towers</b> and a carillon. It was designed by Verein Bochum in Bochum, Westphalia.|$|R
