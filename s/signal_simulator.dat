40|$|Estimating {{signaler}} {{demand is}} critical for ensuring signaling workstations are both feasible to run, and acceptable to staff. While human factors tools exist, they are typically manual, time consuming and rely of the skill of an expert. One solution, explored in this paper, is to use <b>signaling</b> <b>simulators</b> {{to assist in the}} estimation of demand. Full fidelity <b>signaling</b> <b>simulators</b> are already widely used in the UK. Simulators give the ability to ensure a consistent standard of competency ranging from normal routine tasks to abnormal situations (e. g. faults and failures) monitored by an experienced trainer/assessor. Whilst the original aim of full fidelity simulators was to support training and assessment of signalers, the requirement for an accurate timetable and infrastructure model, and of a realistic workstation Human Machine Interface (HMI), opens up other applications. The aim of the Dynamic Modelling of Operator Demand (DMOD) project is to use the Hitachi Information Control System’s simulation environment (TREsim <b>signaling</b> <b>simulator)</b> to deliver a workstation evaluation tool.

40|$|The {{greatest}} {{obstacle to}} a System-on-Chip [SoC] design team’s success is verification. Combining {{the complexity of}} digital verification with the increasing integration of larger and more sophisticated analog circuits, the problem is getting exponentially worse. This trend not only presents {{a challenge to the}} verification engineers, but to the industry as a whole. If verification of digital sub-systems is based on advanced techniques such as constraints capture, randomized or pseudo-randomized stimulus-generation and result collection with functional coverage evaluation, on the other side the use of hand-coded analog blocks models, manually-verified within a digital verification environment has been sufficient to provide confidence in a mixed-signal design to sign-off prior to submitting it for fabrication. However, due to greater levels of integration, changes in process technology and increasing market pressures and risks, an automated and metric-driven methodology is now required.

(GPS user-equipment {{development is a}} lengthy process during which <b>signal</b> <b>simulators</b> are only partially useful.) Upon playback, GPS signals are used by the same or modified receivers so that acquisition, processing, detection and tracking loops can be altered to optimize the receiver parameters.
