50|$|The <b>sword-tailed</b> <b>newt</b> is {{only found}} on the Ryukyu Archipelago, an island chain off the {{southern}} coast of Japan, {{as well as on}} many smaller surrounding islands.This newt's habitat is slow, cool, stagnant bodies of water. They are commonly found in man-made structures such as rice paddies, road-side ditches, and cattle waterholes.The two known subspecies of <b>sword-tailed</b> <b>newt</b> are C. e. ensicauda and C. e. popei. Due to the subtropical climate of its native habitat, it is more tolerant of high temperatures than other Cynops.The <b>sword-tailed</b> <b>newt</b> has no predators, so deforestation and land development are the main reasons for their endangerment.|$|E
50|$|Another study {{estimated}} that this species had diverged from B. dendrobatidis in the Late Cretaceous or early Paleogene. It was shown that while frogs and caecilians were immune to B. salamandrivorans, it was lethal to many European and some North American salamanders. East Asian salamanders were susceptible but able {{to limit the}} infection. The fungus was also detected in a more-than-150-year-old museum specimen of the Japanese <b>sword-tailed</b> <b>newt.</b> This suggests it had originally emerged and co-evolved with salamanders in East Asia, forming its natural reservoir, and was introduced to Europe rather recently through the trade of species such as the fire belly newts as pets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sword-tailed</b> <b>newts</b> {{can reach}} 12.8 cm in males and 18 cm in females. They {{are the largest}} living members of their genus. Females and males look {{significantly}} different in appearance. Females have much longer tails that are actually longer {{than the rest of}} their bodies. Malesâ€™ tails are much shorter and sometimes display a whitish sheen during breeding season.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSodefrin-like female-attracting {{pheromone}} was purified {{from the}} abdominal glands of male <b>sword-tailed</b> <b>newts,</b> Cynops ensicauda, by gel-filtration chromatography and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The final product comprises 10 amino acid residues with the sequence SILSKDAQLK which {{coincided with the}} sequence deduced from its precursor cDNA. This peptide was designated silefrin. The sequence of silefrin was {{different from that of}} sodefrin by two amino acid residues, with substitutions Leu for Pro and Gln for Leu at positions 3 and 8, respectively. Both native and synthetic silefrin exerted an equipotent activity in attracting conspecific females...|$|R
