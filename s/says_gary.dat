"Because {{his works}} are so arresting and {{immediately}} accessible, {{much of the}} contemporary art world is deeply suspicious of him," [...] says Hugh Davies, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. [...] "They think it's too pretty to be profound. It takes time {{to realize that there}} is real profundity and depth to his work.""What is interesting is that Hannock has defied modernism," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Gary</b> Tinterow, Engelhard curator in charge of 19th-century, modern, and contemporary art at the Metropolitan Museum. [...] "He isn't doing abstract painting, or painting according to critical demand. He painted what he wanted to make. The key to Hannock's work is that it is beautiful. Since the fall of modernism as an exclusive ideology, anything goes.""Are Hannock's paintings too derivative? Too accessible? Certainly a devotee of the avant-garde would say so. And it's true that neither the Museum of Modern Art nor the Whitney, the two pantheons of contemporary art, have Hannock's paintings in their collections. Several prominent art critics contacted by FORTUNE either didn't want to talk about Hannock or hadn't heard of him. When I explained to the critic Robert Hughes that many wealthy collectors own Hannock's work, he responded, [...] "The taste of the American rich is shit.""Note: In 2007, the Whitney Museum of American Art acquired one of Hannock's works--Maternal Nocturne: Clearing Storm (Mass MoCA #66-C); polished mixed media on envelope over Chuck Close daguerreotype; 2007.|$|E

[...] Barry Goldwater in 1960 called for Republican unity against John F. Kennedy and the [...] "blueprint for socialism presented by the Democrats." [...] Goldwater in 1964 attacked central planners like fellow Republican Nelson Rockefeller, implying he was a socialist in a millionaire's garb: [...] "The Democratic party believes in what I call socialism: and if that upsets anybody's stomach, let me remind you that central planning of our economy is socialism." [...] Ronald Reagan often quoted Norman Thomas, the perennial Socialist nominee for president in the New Deal era, as saying, [...] "The American people would never knowingly vote for Socialism, but that under the name of liberalism, they would adopt every fragment of the socialist program." [...] In 2010 Newt Gingrich defined [...] "socialism in the broad sense" [...] as [...] "a government-dominated, bureaucratically-controlled, politician-dictated way of life."

Anything grown {{there needs to}} be irrigated, but the resulting runoff, when it contains high levels of selenium, can be toxic to fish, migratory birds, and other wildlife that drink from waterways and drainage ditches. Selenium runoff is subject to monitoring by regional waterquality officials.

The Gary/Abby/Valene love triangle, which involved Gary cheating on Valene with Abby Cunningham – the show's main villain – was a monumental storyline for all three characters. Van Ark described the storyline:"There wasn’t really anything I could think of, but I will mention that Ted and I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. I can’t believe I did that but it really provided me with some great stories. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center but Gary and Val were supposed to be this enduring couple. Ted and I were <b>saying</b> <b>Gary</b> and Val should break up and Gary should go with Abby. It was a pretty big deal to break up the couple that the show began with.

40|$|Around {{the time}} he {{attended}} SAIS, Gary {{was looking for a}} career and mostly to do work in the South America (specifically Colombia), in the field of economics. Prior to SAIS, he was at MIT {{at a time when the}} Peace Corps first came to be. As he did not know, at the time, exactly what he wanted to do, he joined the Peace Corps. Gary reports that he almost didn’t get into SAIS, but in the end, his grades were good enough. He remembers interviewing with one of the professors, though he can’t recall his name. He talked with him for a while and after the conversation, he said, “We’ll take you. ” Gary recalls everyone being very nice and bright at SAIS. He recalls professors with fondness and made friends in his area of Latin America while he was there. He also recalls having to take the Orals (Spanish was his language). At the time, there were only a few Economics courses offered at SAIS. He recalls that the SAIS building was on Massachusetts Avenue (and is still there) and that the Brookings Institute was across the street (also still there). <b>Gary</b> <b>says</b> that his career after SAIS took an evolving path. He worked on his Ph. D. in Economics at the University of Chicago for five years, which he describes as one of the best programs in the country at the time. After five years, he began looking for a job. The AEA had a program and he worked with them to get a job in Philadelphia with the Federal Reserve. There, he struggled at first with his team and says that only five or six of them were really interested in doing good work. On that team, he also worked closely with Anita Summers (Larry Summers’ mother), with whom he and his wife are still closely acquainted. At the time, she was working on several projects related to the Philadelphia School System. Later, there was a blow up in his department, though he stayed there because he wanted to have a job. After Philadelphia, he and his wife moved to Washington, D. C. where he continued work as an Economist at the Federal Reserve. There, he was given a big project to work…. related to the ‘Discount Window’ (tied to the 12 Federal banks that existed then). This effort took several years and he set up a model within which to work that was very different than what anyone else had done at the time. He set up various teams in different locations around the country. Later in his career, he got involved in working on the Y 2 K project. On January 1, 2000, Gary had to be at work at 7 : 00 a. m. He knew about all the big banks and he sat around for a while until the banks opened at 9 : 00 or 10 : 00 a. m. Fortunately, nothing major happened. The banks were fine and life proceeded, business as usual. It was an exciting time for him. Gary also recalls sometimes sitting behind Greenspan during their meetings (and he was involved in taping those meetings). One time, Greenspan complained of not being able to hear in the meeting (as he sat on the other side of a long table) and Gary was involved in making better equipment and improving the design of the room. To current students, Gary advises that they should be open. Sometimes you’re given a problem in life and it’s hard to do…and sometimes you just can’t do it…but you usually get through it. Gary also recalls being in New York on September 11, 2001. He took the subway down to the Federal Reserve bank. When he came out of the subway, paper was flying all around. He decided something was wrong and ran into the building (he was the last one allowed in). Someone told him that a plane had gone into the building. He then heard a ‘crunch’ (the second plane had hit). So, he immediately called his boss. Greenspan was in Europe at the time. So, Gary stayed there all day, watching TV in the Bank building (with 50 other people). He recalls that the dust came into the Bank. They stayed there until 6 : 00 p. m. and then had to walk over the Brooklyn Bridge to the nearest subway. At the end of the day, he ended up in Brooklyn. The next day, he got a train going back to the Board – which took the whole day. He walked right in and talked with others in the building. He describes that it was quite a trip to get back to the Federal Reserve Board building. He worked that day until about 3 : 00 or 4 : 00 p. m. and was then asked to leave to go to a place where he would be safe. He went to this new place and gave a speech. He ended up staying with people that he didn’t know. ...|$|R
