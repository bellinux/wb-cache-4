5|$|Chordophones, {{which produce}} sound by {{vibrating}} {{one or more}} strings; they are sorted into according {{to the relationship between}} the string(s) and the <b>sounding</b> board or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the <b>sounding</b> board and there is no neck, the instrument is a zither whether it is plucked like an autoharp or struck with hammers like a piano. If the instrument has strings parallel to the <b>sounding</b> board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a lute, whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar or uses a membrane like a banjo.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic <b>sounding</b> equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the <b>sounding</b> lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E

40|$|A {{sample of}} 413 <b>soundings</b> in close {{proximity}} to tornadic and nontornadic supercells is examined. The <b>soundings</b> were obtained from hourly analyses generated by the 40 -km Rapid Update Cycle- 2 (RUC- 2) analysis and forecast system. A comparison of 149 observed <b>soundings</b> and collocated RUC- 2 <b>soundings</b> in regional supercell environments reveals that the RUC- 2 model analyses were reasonably accurate through much of the troposphere. The largest error tendencies were in temperatures and mixing ratios near the surface, primarily in 1 -h forecast <b>soundings</b> immediately prior to the standard rawinsonde launches around 1200 and 0000 UTC. Overall, the RUC- 2 analysis <b>soundings</b> appear to be a reasonable proxy for observed <b>soundings</b> in supercell environments. Thermodynamic and vertical wind shear parameters derived from RUC- 2 proximity <b>soundings</b> are evaluated for the following supercell and storm subsets: significantly tornadic supercells (54 <b>soundings),</b> weakly tornadic supercells (144 <b>soundings),</b> nontornadic supercells (215 <b>soundings),</b> and discrete nonsupercell storms (75 <b>soundings).</b> Findings presented herein are then compared to results from previous and ongoing proximity <b>soundings</b> studies. Most significantly, proximity <b>soundings</b> presented here reinforce the findings of previous studies in that vertical shear and moisture within 1 km of the ground can discriminate between nontornadic supercells and supercells producing tornadoes with F 2 or greater damage. Parameters that combine measures of buoyancy, vertical shear, and low-level moisture show the strongest ability to discriminate between supercell classes. 1...|$|R

5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the <b>sounding</b> rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a <b>sounding</b> that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.|$|E
5|$|Daybreaker {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Some reviewers praised the band for texturing and progressing their sound, and for writing socio-political lyrics.

The composite <b>soundings</b> were delivered to the NWS Melbourne (MLB) office for display using the NSHARP software program. NWS MLB requested that the AMU make the composite <b>soundings</b> available for display in AWIPS. The AMU first created a procedure to customize AWIPS so composite <b>soundings</b> could be displayed.

5|$|The new {{tropical}} cyclone moved quickly west-northwestward away from South America, and on August30 reconnaissance aircraft recorded winds of 45mph (75km/h). Based on the observation, the depression was upgraded to tropical storm status {{and given the}} name Francelia. Strengthening continued to near hurricane-force, but the fast-moving circulation outran the convection, causing brief weakening as it passed south of Jamaica. Although initially forecast to continue to the west-northwest, Francelia slowed {{and turned to the}} west-southwest on September1 due to a ridge to its north. Concurrently, the storm intensified into hurricane status after its winds reached 75mph (120km/h), and late on September1 Francelia passed over Swan Island.

40|$|The {{required}} {{number of}} <b>soundings</b> for geotechnical site investigation depends on different {{factors such as}} geology of the site, soil variability {{and the type of}} project to build. Indications on the number of <b>soundings</b> are given in codes of practice (Eurocode 7 [...] .) but they focus mainly on a minimal number which depends only on the area of the project. Geotechnical investigation is a process conducted, in general, in two steps. The first step consists in collecting available information and executing a limited number of <b>soundings</b> on site, while the second step of investigation is based on the first and requires more <b>soundings</b> for soil testing. The preliminary information is expressed by using random sets of the influencing factors (soil variability, geology [...] .). Intervals of values are proposed by experts (engineers) concerning the influence of each factor based on preliminary information from site (soil variability, geology, type of project). The expert proposes an interval of values based on his degree of belief. Using Eurocode 7 recommendations for site <b>soundings,</b> an “objective function” f(X) is constructed to rely “soil variability” to the number of <b>soundings.</b> It permits constructing the random set and obtain the number of <b>soundings</b> by unit area for each expert (engineer). The same reasoning is applied with other parameters such as geology and an inference system is obtained. Information is aggregated from the available parameters (Soil variability, Geology [...] .) and the random sets computed from which upper and lower probabilities (probability boxes) are built. They permit optimizing the number of <b>soundings</b> to be carried out on site. Author preprin...|$|R
