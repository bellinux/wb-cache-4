50|$|Electric turkey fryers {{have been}} {{introduced}} {{that can be used}} indoors. Although the electric fryer does not heat up as fast as with propane, it includes a thermostat with a timer and a thermal <b>safety</b> <b>shut-off.</b> Electric fryers {{can also be used to}} prepare other foods by frying or boiling.|$|E
50|$|A basic halogen oven {{features}} a heating chamber {{consisting of a}} clear glass bowl with a removable glass lid to which the heating assembly is secured. Inside the heating chamber, multi-level metal racks are used to elevate the contents during the cooking process. Within the heating assembly are the circular halogen lamp, a fan, and the controls for the oven which frequently include an automatic shut-off timer and a temperature control interface. On a basic model, the heating assembly has a handle to allow users to safely lift the lid off the unit. More elaborate models have a hinged lid mounted on an adjustable rear support which can be raised to accommodate an extension ring. This raises the heating assembly to reduce the grilling effect as well as increasing {{the volume of the}} oven. Hinged models are safer and easier to use. A <b>safety</b> <b>shut-off</b> switch turns off the lamp when the lid is raised during operation. The glass bowl is positioned in a stand which raises the bowl off the table-top and decreases the transfer of heat to the surrounding surfaces. Handles are often incorporated into the stand to allow for users to move the unit, providing safety especially during or after operation.|$|E
40|$|Energy storage {{systems are}} vital for success of {{electric}} mobility. Thus, knowledge of energy storage systems behaviours {{is essential for}} the development of electric vehicles. Universities and vocational training institutions are urgently required to educate specialists in electrical storage systems. A safe and easy-manageable battery test system was developed to improve the outcomes of student learning of battery storage systems and to allow practice for future employment through hands-on laboratory training. This test system supports temperature-dependent experiments with different cell types including lithium-ion cells, and incorporates a redundant <b>safety</b> <b>shut-off</b> module that protects students from being injured. Based on this system, a new energy storage laboratory course was developed. This course covers four main content areas of battery energy storage: (1) contact &amp; isolation resistance, (2) open-circuit voltage, (3) internal resistance &amp; power, and (4) energy of cells. This new laboratory course was introduced in summer 2016 and has already been conducted with several full-time and part-time student groups...|$|E
25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas <b>shut-off</b> <b>safety</b> mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|R
