40|$|SummaryBackgroundWe {{compared}} the clinical utility of additional intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy with the clinical utility of <b>steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy</b> {{in patients with}} IVIG-resistant Kawasaki disease. MethodsWe enrolled 164 patients with Kawasaki disease who were treated with a single dose of IVIG (2 g/kg) and aspirin (30 mg/kg per day). Twenty-seven of these patients (16 %) were resistant to the initial IVIG treatment. We {{compared the}} effectiveness of treatment strategies for the initial IVIG-resistant 27 patients, 14 of these patients were treated with additional IVIG therapy, and the other 13 patients were treated with <b>steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy</b> (methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg per day for 3 days). ResultsThree patients in the group receiving additional IVIG treatment had coronary artery aneurysms (21. 4 %), no patients had coronary artery aneurysm in the <b>steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy</b> group; {{the difference in the}} incidence of coronary artery aneurysm was not statistically significant. The duration of high fever after additional treatment in the <b>steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy</b> group (1 ± 1. 3 days) was significantly shorter than that in the additional IVIG treatment group (3 ± 2. 4 days; P< 0. 05). The medical costs were significantly lower in the <b>steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy</b> group than in the additional IVIG treatment group. ConclusionSteroid pulse therapy was useful to reduce the fever duration and medical costs for patients with Kawasaki disease. <b>Steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy</b> and additional IVIG treatment were not significantly different in terms of preventing the development of coronary artery aneurysm...|$|R
25|$|Splenectomy (removal of the spleen) may be {{considered}} in patients who are either unresponsive to steroid treatment, have frequent relapses, or cannot be tapered off steroids after a few months. Platelets which have been bound by antibodies are taken up by macrophages in the spleen (which have Fc receptors), and so removal of the spleen reduces platelet destruction. The procedure is potentially risky in ITP cases due to the increased possibility of significant bleeding during surgery. Durable remission following splenectomy is achieved in 60 to 65 percent of ITP cases, less so in older subjects. The use of splenectomy to treat ITP has diminished since the development of <b>steroid</b> <b>therapy</b> and other pharmaceutical remedies.|$|E
25|$|Refractory {{ulcerative}} colitis. Patients with toxic megacolon (colonic dilation > 6cm {{and toxic}} appearing) {{who do not}} respond to <b>steroid</b> <b>therapy</b> within 72 hours should be consulted for colectomy. Those with less severe disease but {{do not respond to}} IV steroids within 7–10 days should be considered for colectomy or IV cyclosporine. IV cyclosporine at a rate of 2mg/kg/day and if no response in 7–10 days, colectomy should be considered. If response is seen, oral cyclosporine at 8mg/kg/day should be continued for 3–4 months while 6-MP or azathioprine is introduced. Those already on 6-MP or azathioprine should continue with these medications. A cholesterol level should be checked in patients taking cyclosporine as low cholesterol may predispose to seizures. Also, prophylaxis against PCP (Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia is advised.|$|E

40|$|Objective. A wide mucosal defect after {{endoscopic}} submucosal dissection (ESD) for {{esophageal cancer}} {{is associated with}} increased risk of stricture. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the feasibility of short-period, high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone administration (<b>steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy)</b> in preventing post-ESD esophageal stricture. Methods. This prospective study examined 13 lesions in 11 consecutive patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent ESD that involved three-quarters or more of the circumference of the esophagus or who had a longitudinal resected specimen diameter of ≥ 5 [*]cm. <b>Steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy</b> was initiated the day after ESD and continued for 3 consecutive days. The primary endpoint was the stricture rate after ESD. Secondary endpoints were adverse events (AEs) associated with <b>steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy,</b> time until the development of stricture, and the frequency and duration of endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD). Results. The stricture rate was 54. 5 % (6 / 11). The median time until stricture development was 15 days. The median number of EBD sessions required was 2. 5. The median duration of EBD was 14. 5 days. AEs related to <b>steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy</b> and postprocedure complications were not observed. Conclusion. No preventive effect of the stricture after esophageal ESD by <b>steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy</b> was found, although the therapy was administered safely...|$|R

2500|$|In {{allergic}} angioedema, {{avoidance of}} the allergen {{and use of}} antihistamines may prevent future attacks. Cetirizine is a commonly prescribed antihistamine for angioedema. [...] Some patients have reported success with {{the combination of a}} nightly low dose of cetirizine to moderate the frequency and severity of attacks, followed by a much higher dose when an attack does appear. [...] Severe angioedema cases may require desensitization to the putative allergen, as mortality can occur. Chronic cases require <b>steroid</b> <b>therapy,</b> which generally leads to a good response. In cases where allergic attack is progressing towards airway obstruction, epinephrine may be life-saving.|$|E
2500|$|Full {{recovery}} {{is seen in}} [...] 50 to 70% of cases, ranging to 70 to 90% recovery with some minor residual disability (typically assessed using measures such as mRS or EDSS), average time to recover is one to six months. The mortality rate may {{be as high as}} 5%. Poorer outcomes are associated with unresponsiveness to <b>steroid</b> <b>therapy,</b> unusually severe neurological symptoms, or sudden onset. Children tend to have more favorable outcomes than adults, and cases presenting without fevers tend to have poorer outcomes. The latter effect may be due to either protective effects of fever, or that diagnosis and treatment is sought more rapidly when fever is present.|$|E
2500|$|After initial {{reports by}} the Portuguese {{physician}} Amato Lusitano in 1556 and Lazarus de la Rivière (physician to the King of France) in 1658, {{it was the}} German physician and poet Paul Gottlieb Werlhof who in 1735 wrote the most complete initial report of the purpura of ITP. Platelets were unknown at the time. The name [...] "Werlhof's disease" [...] was used more widely before the current descriptive name became more popular. Platelets were described in the early 19th century, and in the 1880s several investigators linked the purpura with abnormalities in the platelet count. The first report of a successful therapy for ITP was in 1916, when a young Polish medical student, Paul Kaznelson, described a female patient's response to a splenectomy. Splenectomy remained a first-line remedy until the introduction of <b>steroid</b> <b>therapy</b> in the 1950s.|$|E

30|$|Various {{treatments}} {{are available for}} CAR, including <b>steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy,</b> plasmapheresis, immunoglobulin, intravitreal injection of steroids, and chemotherapy for the primary disease. Although intravenous <b>steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy</b> {{was carried out in}} the previous three cases, improvement of symptoms was only observed in this study. From the 59 th day following the onset of CAR, intravenous <b>steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy</b> was carried out in 2 -week intervals for two courses. Her left visual acuity improved, and she was able to read numbers from the fourth day after starting the course. However, even if the visual dysfunction improves transiently, it often recurs. There was no recurrence even 14  months after the onset of CAR in this case, though. While the early diagnosis and early treatment of CAR leads to improvement in the visual function, there have been reports of an improved visual dysfunction even when started after 9  months [7]. However, only one previous case recovered completely [5], so making a perfect recovery seems difficult. In the present case, despite starting the treatment 2  months after the onset of CAR, it was still effective. Considering the balance needed between treatment for CAR and that for the original disease, we should at least consider intravenous <b>steroid</b> pulse <b>therapy</b> to improve patients’ quality of life.|$|R
