Multi–state {{analysis of}} the impacts of avian pox on a population of <b>Serins</b> (Serinus serinus) : the importance of estimating recapture rates. — Disease {{is one of the}} evolutionary forces shaping populations. Recent studies have shown that epidemics like avian pox, malaria, or mycoplasmosis have affected passerine population dynamics, being responsible for the decline of some populations or disproportionately killing males and larger individuals and thus selecting for specific morphotypes. However, few studies have estimated the effects of an epidemic by following individual birds using the capture–recapture approach. Because avian pox can be diagnosed by direct examination of the birds, we are here able to analyze, using multistate models, the development and consequences of an avian pox epidemic affecting in 1996, a population of <b>Serins</b> (Serinus serinus) in northeastern Spain.

500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, <b>serin</b> and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

40|$|Sperm {{competition}} {{is a strong}} force {{on the evolution of}} mating behaviour of animals, particularly birds. In monogamous birds extrapair behaviour is one main source of variation in the reproductive success of males, which has caused the evolution of paternity guards as well as strategies by females to increase the genetic quality of their descendants. We investigated the importance of sperm competition in the reproductive behaviour of <b>serins,</b> Serinus serinus. Male <b>serins</b> guarded their mates and also copulated frequently, indicating that sperm competition has been an important selective force affecting their mating behaviour. Females were frequently approached and chased by extrapair males that attempted extrapair copulations. However, females refused almost every attempt by extrapair males. No extrapair paternity was detected in the population, in spite of the intense extrapair behaviour of males. This supports the view that females keep strong control over paternity, and that in this population they do not seem to obtain genetic benefits from extrapair copulations. We discuss why the presence of high levels of sexual competition may not be reflected in extrapair paternity. Copyright 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|Earlier {{migration}} in males than in females is the commonest pattern in migrating passerines and is {{positively related to}} size dimorphism and dichromatism. The early arrival of males is a costly trait that may confer reproductive advantages in terms of better territories and/or mates. Given the physiological cost of migration, early migrants are those in best condition and accordingly the prevalence, load, and/or diversity of parasites {{is expected to increase}} in both sexes for late migrants. To test this hypothesis, we sampled 187 trans-Saharan migrant garden warblers Sylvia borin and 64 resident <b>serins</b> Serinus serinus (as a control for potential circannual patterns in parasite load) during spring {{migration in}} Spain. We assessed the prevalence of blood parasites (Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, and Leucocytozoon) and the prevalence and load of intestinal parasites (mainly coccidians and spirurids). The relationship between parasite (prevalence, load, and richness) and the timing of passage through a stopover area was tested using generalized linear models. Protandry occurs in the monomorphic garden warbler and males migrated on average 5. 5 days before females. Intestinal parasite richness increased with the date of migration. The timing of migration was unrelated to the presence or load of the other parasite groups analyzed. Our results support the idea that the timing of migration is a condition-dependent trait and suggests that multiple intestinal parasite infestations could delay migration in birds. Even in monomorphic species parasites {{may play a role in}} sexual selection by delaying the arrival of the most infected individuals at breeding grounds, thereby further increasing the benefits of mating with early-arriving individuals...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} {{models for}} the analysis of recapture data for 2678 <b>serins</b> (Serinus serinus) ringed in north-eastern Spain since 1985. We investigated several time- and individual-specific factors as potential predictors of overall mortality and dispersal patterns, and of gender and age differences in these patterns. Time-specific covariates included minimum daily temperature, days below freezing, and abundance of a strong competitor, siskins (Carduelis spinus) during winter, and maximum temperature and rainfall during summer. Individual covariates included body mass (i. e. body condition), and wing length (i. e. flying ability), and interactions between body mass and environmental factors. We found little support of a predictive relationship between environmental factors and survival, but good evidence of relationships between body mass and survival, especially for juveniles. Juvenile survival appears to vary in a curvilinear manner with increasing mass, suggesting that there may exist an optimal mass beyond which increases are detrimental. The mass-survival relationship does seem to be influenced by at least one environmental factor, namely the abundance of wintering siskins. When siskins are abundant, increases in body mass appear to relate strongly to increasing survival. When siskin numbers are average or low the relationship is largely reversed, suggesting that the presence of strong competition mitigates the otherwise largely negative aspects of greater body mass. Wing length in juveniles also appears to be related positively to survival, perhaps largely due to the influence of a few unusually large juveniles with adult-like survival. Further work is needed to test these relationships, ideally under experimentation. ...|$|R
40|$|Thioredoxins are small, {{regulatory}} proteins {{with a mass}} {{of approximately}} 12 kDa and a characteristic conserved active center, which is represented in the pentapeptide trp-cys-gly-pro-cys. Up to now {{it is not possible}} to present a complete list of thioredoxin interaction partners because there is no predictable sequence in the target enzymes where thioredoxins can interact with. To get closer information about the functions and possible interaction partners of the three thioredoxins from the social soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum (DdTrx 1 - 3) we have chosen two different strategies. In the first one the thioredoxin levels in the cell should changed by different mutants. But both the antisense technique as well as the creation of knock out mutants were not appropiate strategies in this case. Just an thioredoxin overexpressing mutant results in a developmental phenotype which allows some conclusions for possible functions of the thioredoxin in Dictyostelium discoideum. The second strategie was the two hybrid system where thioredoxin interactions partners can identified systematically. After a screening with a cDNA library from Dictyostelium 13 potential interaction partners could be detected, among them a ribonucleotid reductase, TRFA, two different cytochrome c oxidase subunits, filopodin, three ribosomal proteins, the elongationfactor 1 a and the alcohol dehydrogenase from yeast. The verification of the interaction between thioredoxin and these two hybrid clones happened indirectly by a dobble mutant of thioredoxin 1, where the cysteines in the active center were replaced by redox-inactive <b>serins.</b> Further examinations of two choosen candidates resulted that the alcohol dehydrogenase from yeast is a thioredoxin-modululated enzym and that there is an interaction between the elongationfactor 1 a and the thioredoxin 1 from Dictyostelium discoideum...|$|R
