40|$|An {{understanding}} of the reactivity of hydrophobic organic micropollutants (HOMs) {{is of paramount importance}} to water quality managers because of their toxicity, persistence, and liability to bioaccumulate. In this study, the role played by the main estuarine variables (organic matter, suspended particulate matter [SPM], particle type and salinity) on HOM behaviour was investigated by employing samples from estuaries with different geochemical signatures (Chupa, Russia, and the Dart, Plym, Beaulieu and Carnon, U K). A laboratory-based technique was developed for the determination of the solubility and <b>sorptive</b> <b>behaviour</b> of HOMs using 14 C-labelled, beta-emitting organic compounds (2, 2, 5 '-tetrachlorobiphenyl (2, 2 ’ 5, 5 '-TCB), bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate ester (DEHP), and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)) coupled with liquid scintillation counting. The results indicate that relative solubility is mainly dependent upon the type of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) present, not its concentration, and is reduced with increasing salinity. The uptake of 2, 2 ’ 5, 5 '-TCB and BaP by particles is time dependent with a system response time (the time required to achieve 63...|$|E
40|$|During {{bioremediation}} of poorly watersoluble contaminants of soil, {{the partial}} metabolism or cometabolism - besides the complete metabolization - to {{carbon dioxide and}} water - plays a pivotal role. The reaction products of these process may be excreted and used for chemical secondary reactions e. g. polymerisation reactions. Interestingly, a complete degradation of PAH in soil seems to be accompanied inevitably by incomplete metabolism, leading to formation of socalled 'bound residues'. One explanation could be the formation of covalent bonds between PAH metabolites and the soil matrix. Representative PAH metabolites were defined and structurally characterised. Anthracene and pyrene were studied most intensively and radioactively labelled metabolites were created thereof (" 1 " 4 C-labeling). These radioactively labeled metabolites {{can be used in}} tracer experiments to study their chemical and <b>sorptive</b> <b>behaviour</b> in defined soil matrices. A second aim is to study the extent and the kind of the alteration of soil structures during binding of PAH metabolites. Finally, the reversibility of these processes is to be studied. (orig.)

30|$|Up to now, this is {{the first}} study that used SPME to measure Cfree of HOCs in SPM. Although it is rather unlikely, that SPM and the {{surrounding}} water will establish an equilibrium under realistic conditions, the ratio of Ctotal and Cfree (KD) helps to understand the partitioning of HOCs between SPM and water and thus the <b>sorptive</b> <b>behaviour</b> to SPM. For SPM, Fig.  4 shows a weaker sorption and generally more scattered KD values compared to the sediment. For the sediment, Fig.  4 demonstrates stronger sorption of PAHs compared to PCBs. These different sorptive behaviours of PAHs and PCBs to the sediment are in agreement with other studies Bucheli and Gustafsson [20] and Koelmans et al. [21]. Jonker and Koelmans [22] suggested that this results from different chemical structures of PAHs and PCBs. They concluded that pore sorption in soot is the main factor for PCBs and PAHs. Additionally, PAHs are able to from non-covalent interactions because of their planar structure. This indicates that when there are more possibilities for PAHs to develop a bond, the sorption of PAHs to the sediment is stronger. We suggest that these different sorption capacities in both matrices result from ageing processes during and after sedimentation of SPM to the sediment.|$|E

The nanoclays have been converted into environmentally friendly and hydrophobic sorbents by a hydrothermal method under mild conditions using Hexadecyltrimetylammonium bromide HDTMAB as intercalant. Batch sorption studies were studied for oil concentration 0. 5 - 5. 0 g 100 ml and contact time 1 - 30 mins. An attempt to describe the crude oil <b>sorptive</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the organoclays b applying popular adsorption models were discussed and the experimental methods adopted for the determination and estimation of the sorption coefficients have also been described. The Langmuir the Freundlich and the Dubinin-Radushkevich adsorption models were applied to experimental equilibrium data. Also the kinetic properties of the sorption procedure were evaluated using the pseudo-second-order Elovich and the intraparticle diffusion of Weber and Morris kinetics models. It was discovered that the sorption process best fitted the Langmuir and the Pseudo-second-order rate models. It was concluded that the organoclays have a good affinity for the crude oil the sorption process was mostly by monolayer coverage the manner of sorption by chemisorption and that diffusion {{was not only the}} rate-controlling step...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} clay {{minerals}} to adsorb heavy metal cations {{is an important}} property {{in the context of}} the increasing contamination of the aquatic environment and soils by toxic waste. Laboratory studies of the sorption of heavy metals by clays have mostly been carried out using montmorillonite and illite (Chester, 1965; Egozy, 1970; Bourg & Filby, 1974; Helios-Rybicka & Schoer, 1982), less frequently for kaolinite, and only rarely for mixed-layer illite-montmorillonite (Helios-Rybicka, 1983) and the fibrous clay minerals sepiolite and palygorskite. This note describes the <b>sorptive</b> <b>behaviour</b> of sepiolite towards Ni, Zn and Cd. The sepiolite used was from Alwernia, southern Poland. The original sample was contaminated by calcite and had the following chemical composition: SiO 2 67. 36 %, A 1203 4. 76 %, Fe 203 3. 90 %, TiO 2 0. 34 %, CaO 1. 15 %, MgO 11. 97 %, K 20 1. 53 %, Na 20 1. 08 %, LOI 7. 51 %.

40|$|Laboratory batch {{techniques}} {{were used to}} study the <b>sorptive</b> <b>behaviour</b> of 4 -t-octylphenol (OP), a xenobiotic with oestrogenic properties, to sediments from three English rivers of contrasting water quality. Samples were taken from industrially polluted lower reaches of the Aire and Calder rivers, in the Humber catchment, {{as well as a}} rural reach of the River Thames, in Oxfordshire in the South of England. The results showed that given either sufficient time or mixing, a large proportion of OP in solution will sorb to the bed-sediments, with distribution coefficients (Kd) of 6 – 700 l kg− 1 and organic carbon normalised partition coefficients (Koc) 3500 – 18   000 l kg− 1. The sediments which sorbed the highest quantities of OP had higher total organic carbon and a greater proportion of clay and silt particles. There was evidence in some bed-sediments of a sorption-desorption hysteresis effect between OP and sediment. The suspended sediments, on a carbon for carbon basis, adsorbed 5 – 35 times more OP than their respective bed-sediments in the Aire and Calder rivers: microscopic examination suggested that the suspended sediments were predominantly organic aggregates. The suspended sediments of the Thames adsorbed far less OP than those of the Aire and Calder: microscopic examination revealed these suspended sediments to be largely algae. The work predicts that suspended sediments may {{play a key role in}} the fate of OP in the industrial reaches of English Rivers. In the comparatively rural reach of the Thames, a higher proportion of OP might be predicted to remain free in solution...|$|E

The mathematical model developed relates initial sheet conditions, paper sheet properties, drying conditions and dryer section. configuration to the variation of the moisture content and temperature in the paper sheet as well as energy consumption per unit production. The theoretical model was based on mass and energy balance equations about a slice of paper composing pulp fibres, free and bound water, water vapour and air. Time-varying boundary conditions, corresponding to the movement of the paper sheet over the 40 - 50 drying cylinders, were assigned and the equations were converted to finite difference form and solved by computer using standard linear algebra methods. The heat and mass transfer coefficients which control evaporation rates in the dryer section were investigated experimentally. Drying trials and boundary layer analysis were performed to establish the effects of dryer fabric permeability and tension, air flow, cylinder surface temperature, pulp furnish and sheet basis weight on paper drying rates. A number of paper sheet properties were investigated as part of the study. The pore size distribution, permeability and <b>sorptive</b> <b>behaviour</b> of machine made newsprint were investigated experimentally and theoretically. Other paper properties correlated from literature {{for the purposes of this}} study included thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, density, fibre saturation point, diffusibility and shrinkage.

40|$|The {{flavonoid}} {{class of}} plant secondary metabolites play a multifunctional role in below-ground plant-microbe interactions with their best known function as signals in the nitrogen fixing legume-rhizobia symbiosis. Flavonoids enter rhizosphere soil {{as a result}} of root exudation and senescence but little is known about their subsequent fate or impacts on microbial activity. Therefore, the present study examined the <b>sorptive</b> <b>behaviour,</b> biodegradation and impact on dehydrogenase activity (as determined by iodonitrotetrazolium chloride reduction) of the flavonoids naringenin and formononetin in soil. Organic carbon normalised partition coefficients, log K-oc, of 3. 12 (formononetin) and 3. 19 (naringenin) were estimated from sorption isotherms and, after comparison with literature log K-oc values for compounds whose soil behaviour is better characterised, the test flavonoids were deemed to be moderately sorbed. Naringenin (spiked at 50 mu g g(- 1)) was biodegraded without a detectable lag phase with concentrations reduced to 0. 13 +/- 0. 01 mu g g(- 1) {{at the end of the}} 96 h time course. Biodegradation of formononetin proceeded after a lag phase of similar to 24 with concentrations reduced to 4. 5 +/- 1 % of the sterile control after 72 h. Most probable number (MPN) analysis revealed that prior to the addition of flavonoids, the soil contained 5. 4 x 10 (6) MPNg(- 1) (naringenin) and 7. 9 x 10 (5) MPNg(- 1) (formononetin) catabolic microbes. Formononetin concentration had no significant (p > 0. 05) effect on soil dehydrogenase activity, whereas naringenin concentration had an overall but non-systematic impact (p = 0. 045). These results are discussed with reference to likely total and bioavailable concentrations of flavonoids experienced by microbes in the rhizosphere. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|High-frequency {{sampling}} {{of two major}} stream inflows to a large eutrophic lake (Lake Rotorua, New Zealand) was conducted to measure inputs of total suspended sediment (TSS), and fractions of nitrogen and phosphorus (P). A total of 17 rain events were sampled, including three during which both streams were simultaneously monitored to quantify how concentration–discharge (Q) relationships varied between catchments during similar hydrological conditions. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations declined slightly during events, reflecting dilution of groundwater inputs by rainfall, whereas dissolved inorganic P (PO 4 –P) concentrations were variable and unrelated to Q, suggesting dynamic <b>sorptive</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Event loads of total nitrogen (TN) were predominantly DIN, which is available for immediate uptake by primary producers, whereas total phosphorus (TP) loads predominantly comprised particulate P (less labile). Positive correlations between Q and concentrations of TP (and {{to a lesser extent}} TN) reflected increased particulate nutrient concentrations at high flows. Consequently, load estimates based on hourly Q during storm events and concentrations of routine monthly samples (mostly base flow) under-estimated TN and TP loads by an average of 19 % and 40 % respectively. Hysteresis with Q was commonly observed and inclusion of hydrological variables that reflect Q history in regression models improved predictions of TN and TP concentrations. Lorenz curves describing the proportions of cumulative load versus cumulative time quantified temporal inequality in loading. In the two study streams, 50 % of estimated two-year loads of TN, TP and TSS were transported in 202 – 207, 76 – 126 and 1 – 8 days respectively. This study quantifies how hydrological and landscape factors can interact to influence pollutant flux at the catchment scale and highlights the importance of including storm transfers in lake loading estimates.

40|$|The {{speciation}} and particle-water {{interactions of}} Ni were investigated in three estuaries with contrasting pollution levels, hydrodynamics and geochemical characteristics. Samples {{of water and}} sediments were collected seasonally from the Tamar, Tweed and Mersey Estuaries. The chemical speciation of dissolved Ni was determined by adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (ACSV), and the <b>sorptive</b> <b>behaviour</b> of Ni was studied under simulated estuarine conditions using " Ni coupled to liquid scintillation counting. A relatively high particle reactivity was observed only in the Tamar Estuary, where ACSV-non labile Ni was removed in the low salinity region, followed by addition of ACSV-labile Ni in the mid-estuarine region. The largely conservative behaviour of dissolved Ni in the Tweed Estuary was attributed to the combination of rapid flushing and low suspended particles concentration. In the Mersey Estuary, dissolved Ni (and Co, Zn, Cd and Pb) often showed positive deviations from conservative behaviour, which were attributed to anthropogenic and/or geochemical inputs. The fraction of ACSV-non labile Ni behaved differently in the three estuaries, with a sharp decrease from 90 to 30 % from freshwater to seawater in the Tamar, scatter between 30 and 70 % in the Tweed, and relatively constant values of 50 - 70 % in the Mersey. These differences are interpreted {{within the context of}} different hydrodynamics and geochemistry of the three estuaries. Speciation modelling showed that between 30 and 70 % of dissolved Ni in the Tweed, and between 50 and 70 % in the Mersey, was bound to a class of strong ligands (log K'NIL = 19. 0 ± 0. 4 and 18. 7 ± 0. 5, respectively), which were saturated by the ambient concentrations of Ni throughout the estuaries, suggesting that the ligands are highly specific towards Ni. Irradiation of riverwater samples with UV light (believed to remove dissolved organic matter) significantly enhanced Ni uptake onto estuarine suspended particulate matter, with an increase in the 63 Ni distribution coefficients (Kds) of up to 10 fold. Conversely, the addition of synthetic humic acids to UV-treated riverwater decreased significantly the 63 Ni Kds. Complexation of Ni by dissolved natural ligands also affected the progression of sorptive reactions, with a system response time (i. e. the time required to achieve 63 % of the sorptive equilibrium) between 1. 6 and 8. 9 hours. The results from this study suggest that the low particle reactivity generally exhibited by Ni during estuarine mixing is due to its ability to complex strongly with dissolved natural ligands (truly dissolved organic or colloidal organic/inorganic), and therefore resist adsorption onto particles...|$|E
40|$|The sorptive {{potential}} of sunflower stem, a cheap agricultural waste abundantly available, {{has been exploited}} for Cr(III), Cd(II), Sb(III) and Hg(II) ions. The sorption of each toxic metal onto sunflower stem is optimized {{with respect to the}} nature of electrolytes (buffers of pH 1 - 10, acids and deionized water), amount of sorbent and sorbate, equilibration time between the two phases at fixed temperature. The sorption of metal ions onto the sorbent surface is monitored using radiotracer and batch technique as a function of a parameter keeping the rest constant in order to accumulate maximum amount of sorbate onto sunflower stem. The sorption data of Cr(III), Cd(II), Sb(III) and Hg (II) ions have been subjected to Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Redushkevich (D-R) isotherms. The sorption of each metal ion has followed all three models. The sorption capacity, intensity and energy of each sorbate have been estimated using regression analysis. The values of correlation coefficient Î³ of such analyses are close to unity. The sorption mean free energy evaluated from D-R isotherm ranges between 8. 66 - 10. 33 kJ mol- 1. The kinetic data have been applied to Lagergren, Reichenberg and Morris Weber equations. The linear follow up of the sorption of Cr(III), Sb(III) and Hg (II) to Lagergren equation indicates first order sorption whereas the Reichenberg equation reflects the effectiveness of the diffusion of trace metal ions within sorbent particles. The linear follow up of kinetic data of the sorption of Cr(III) ions to the Morris-Weber equation indicates the partial intraparticle diffusion of Cr(III) ions. The variation of sorption as a function of temperature was carried out for all four sorbates. The thermodynamic coefficients Î&# 8221;H, Î&# 8221;S and Î&# 8221;G have been evaluated using regression analysis. The negative values of Î&# 8221;G for all metal ions studied indicate spontaneous nature and feasibility of the sorption. The negative values of Î&# 8221;H for Cr(III) and Hg (II) ions show exothermic, while the positive values of Î&# 8221;H of Cd(II) and Sb(III) ions represent the endothermic nature of the sorption respectively. The influence of common anions, cations and complexing agents on the sorption of sorbates has also been investigated. Bisulphate, Fe(III), molybdate, citrate, Fe(II) and Y(III) ions suppress the sorption of Cr(III) ions significantly. Fe(III). EDTA, Pb(II) and thiosulphate ions reduce the sorption of Cd(II) ions drastically, whereas, tartrate, dichromate, Ca(II) and Sn(II) impede sorption of Cd (II) ions. The sorption of Hg (II) ions is enhanced in the presence of ascorbate, Sr(II) and Y(III), whereas it is suppressed in the presence of disuphite, iodide, Cd(II), bisuphite and thiocyanate. Bismuthate, Sn(lI) and Fe (III) increase the sorption of Sb(III) ions whereas molybdate, chromate, iodate, sulphate, fluoride and thiocyanate reduce the same. The sorption of other elements from different groups of periodic table and oxidation states have been investigated under optimised conditions selected for each sorbate. This selectivity study indicates that Cr(III), Eu(III) and Tb(III) can be separated from I(I) and Tc(VII); Hg (II) and Tc(VII) ions from I(I) and Cs(I); Cd(II) and Eu(IIIl) ions from Cs (I) and Sb(III), Eu(III) and Sc(III) can be separated from Se(IV), Cs(I) and As(III) using sunflower stem column. The sorption {{potential of}} sunflower stem for the ions Cr(III), Cd(II), Sb(III) and Hg (II) have been evaluated and compared with other biosorbents in the relevant sections of result discussions. Its <b>sorptive</b> <b>behaviour</b> is better or comparable with other biosorbents. Based on the chemical composition of sunflower stem and functional groups present in the sorbent matrix, a possible mechanism of biosorption of ions of Cr(III), Cd(II), Sb(III) and Hg(II) ions onto the sunflower stem has been suggested. This cheaper and novel sorbent has potential applications in water decontamination, industrial water treatment and in pollution abatement, in analytical and environmental chemistry </td...|$|E
