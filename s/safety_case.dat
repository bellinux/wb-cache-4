40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} growing {{interest}} {{in the concept of}} <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> for medical devices and health information technology, but questions remain about how <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> can be developed and used meaningfully in the safety management of healthcare services and processes. The paper presents two examples of the development and use of <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> at a service level in healthcare. These first practical experiences at the service level suggest that <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> might be a useful tool to support service improvement and communication of safety in healthcare. The paper argues that <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> might be helpful in supporting healthcare organisations with the adoption of proactive and rigorous safety management practices. However, {{it is also important to}} consider the different level of maturity of safety management and regulatory oversight in healthcare. Adaptations to the purpose and use of <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> might be required, complemented by the provision of education to both practitioners and regulators...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{virtually}} all safety-critical industries the operators of systems have {{to demonstrate a}} systematic and thorough consideration of safety. This is increasingly being done by demonstrating that certain goals have been achieved, rather than by simply following prescriptive standards. Such goal-based <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> could be a valuable tool for reasoning about safety in healthcare organisations, such as hospitals. System-wide <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> are very complex, and a reasonable approach is {{to break down the}} safety argument into sub-system <b>safety</b> <b>cases.</b> In this paper we outline the development of a goal-based top-level argument for demonstrating the safety of a particular class of medical devices (medical beds). We review relevant standards both from healthcare and from other industries, and illustrate how these can inform the development of an appropriate safety argument. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges for the development and use of goal-based <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> in healthcare. ...|$|R

This was most prevalent in Reactor 1 because of the different core design to Reactors 2, 3 and 4. BNFL were unable to make an adequate <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> or effect an economic repair and therefore, Reactor 1 did not return to power from its annual outage in August 2001. The core of Reactor 4 was repaired but this reactor did not return to power after the repair.|$|E

2500|$|The {{safety issue}} of a {{possible}} fire on a passenger-vehicle shuttle garnered much attention, with Eurotunnel noting that fire was the risk attracting the most attention in a 1994 <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> for three reasons: the opposition of ferry companies to passengers being allowed to remain with their cars; Home Office statistics indicating that car fires had doubled in ten years; and the long length of the tunnel. Eurotunnel commissioned the UK Fire Research Station - {{now part of the}} Building Research Establishment - to give reports of vehicle fires, and liaised with Kent Fire Brigade to gather vehicle fire statistics over one year. Fire tests took place at the French Mines Research Establishment with a mock wagon used to investigate how cars burned. The wagon door systems are designed to withstand fire inside the wagon for 30minutes, longer than the transit time of 27minutes. Wagon air conditioning units help to purge dangerous fumes from inside the wagon before travel. Each wagon has a fire detection and extinguishing system, with sensing of ions or ultraviolet radiation, smoke and gases that can trigger halon gas to quench a fire. Since the HGV wagons are not covered, fire sensors are located on the loading wagon and in the tunnel. A [...] water main in the service tunnel provides water to the main tunnels at [...] intervals. The ventilation system can control smoke movement. Special arrival sidings accept a train that is on fire, as the train is not allowed to stop whilst on fire in the tunnel, unless continuing its journey would lead to a worse outcome. Eurotunnel has banned a wide range of hazardous goods from travelling in the tunnel. Two STTS (Service Tunnel Transportation System) vehicles with firefighting pods are on duty at all times, with a maximum delay of 10minutes before they reach a burning train.|$|E

40|$|Model-based {{development}} and automated code generation are increasingly used for actual production code, {{in particular in}} mathematical and engineering domains. However, since code generators are typically not qualified, {{there is no guarantee}} that their output satisfies the system requirements, or is even safe. Here we present an approach to systematically derive <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> that argue along the hierarchical structure in model-based development. The <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> are constructed mechanically using a formal analysis, based on automated theorem proving, of the automatically generated code. The analysis recovers the model structure and component hierarchy from the code, providing independent assurance of both code and model. It identifies how the given system safety requirements are broken down into component requirements, and where they are ultimately established, thus establishing a hierarchy of requirements that is aligned with the hierarchical model structure. The derived <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> reflect the results of the analysis, and provide a high-level argument that traces the requirements on the model via the inferred model structure to the code. We illustrate our approach on flight code generated from hierarchical Simulink models by Real-Time Worksho...|$|R

50|$|A <b>Safety</b> <b>Case</b> is a {{structured}} argument, supported by evidence, intended to justify that {{a system is}} acceptably safe for a specific application in a specific operating environment. Safety cases are often required {{as part of a}} regulatory process, a certificate of safety being granted only when the regulator is satisfied by the argument presented in a <b>safety</b> <b>case.</b> Industries regulated in this way include transportation (such as aviation, the automotive industry and railways) and medical devices. As such there are strong parallels with the formal evaluation of risk used to prepare a Risk Assessment, although the result will be case specific. A vehicle <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> may show it to be acceptably safe to be driven on a road, but conclude that it may be unsuited to driving on rough ground, or with an off-center load for example, if there would then be a greater risk of danger e.g. a loss of control or an injury to the occupant. The information used to compile the <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> may then formally guarantee further specifications, such as maximum safe speeds, permitted safe loads, or any other operational parameter. A <b>safety</b> <b>case</b> should be revisited when an existing product is to be re-purposed in a new way, if this extends beyond the scope of the original assessment.|$|E

This paper shows how <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> support the application of the latest generation of augmented Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Unfortunately, at almost the same time as these satellite-based systems have been approved to provide location and timing information in safety-critical applications, a range of organisations including the UK Ministry of Defence, have raised concerns about our increasing vulnerability to attacks on architectures that depend upon GPS, GLONASS etc. These threats are compounded by the difficulty of representing and reasoning about the impact of jamming, spoofing and insider threats within safety argumentation techniques. Such attacks invalidate many of the assumptions that support the provision of critical services. We show how a risk based approach to the identification of attack scenarios can be used to assess the resilience of <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> to the impact of external security threats...|$|R

40|$|A key {{challenge}} {{in the development of}} <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> for geological repositories is associated with the long periods of time over which radioactive wastes that are disposed of in repositories remain hazardous. The OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has recently examined issues related to timescales in the context of two projects {{under the auspices of the}} Radioactive Waste Management Committee (RWMC) : the Timescales Initiative and the Long-Term Safety Criteria (LTSC) Initiative. These projects examine, respectively, the treatment of timescales in actual <b>safety</b> <b>cases</b> and in the development of radiological protection criteria for geological disposal. They treat different aspects of timescales but have some overlap and have shown some convergence of the results achieved to date. Based on these projects, this paper examines general considerations in the handling of timescales, including ethical principles, evolution of the hazards of radioactive waste over time, and uncertainty in the evolution of repository systems (including geological features). The implications of these considerations are examined in terms of repository siting; levels of protection in regulations; planning for pre-closure and post-closure actions; and development and presentation of <b>safety</b> <b>cases.</b> A comparison is made with previous NEA work related to timescales, in order to show evolutions in current understanding. ...|$|R
