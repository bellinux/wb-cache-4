40|$|<b>Shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> - {{efforts to}} {{increase}} shareholder power within the corporation - appears to have come of age, both within the United States and abroad. In the past few years, U. S. shareholders have worked to strengthen their voice within the corporation by seeking to remove perceived impediments to their voting authority. These impediments include classified boards, the plurality standard for board elections, and the inability to nominate directors on the corporation 2 ̆ 7 s ballot. Shareholders 2 ̆ 7 efforts have also extended to seeking a voice on the compensation of corporate officers and directors. Advocates of <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> believe that such efforts are critical to buttressing shareholder value and curbing managerial abuses of authority. However, {{there are many who}} criticize <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy,</b> claiming that it will undermine firm value and corporate governance. Opponents also insist that <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> will undermine corporate efforts to focus on non-shareholder constituents such as employees, customers, and communities. This Article examines these and other criticisms in the context of international {{efforts to increase}} <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy,</b> and argues that the international experience with <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> undercuts the force of such critiques. Indeed, experiences in other countries suggest that <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> can achieve its desired result of enhancing financial returns and reducing corporate misconduct. In this way, the Article relies on international corporate governance trends to provide a novel, significant perspective to the ongoing debate over the propriety of <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> in the United States...|$|E

40|$|At {{a virtual}} {{shareholders}} meeting {{there is no}} physical gathering of shareholders, {{but they will be}} able to assemble and vote via the internet. Together with the notice of the meeting a person can be sent a personal login code. With this code shareholders can access a heavily secured VGM platform where the AGM will take place. At this platform shareholders can find all relevant AGM information, assembly papers and a discussion forum. At the discussion forum shareholders can take cognizance of the discussion and participate therein by asking questions to the board or by reacting to the contributions of other shareholders. Members of the board can answer questions and react to the input of shareholders. Consequently, a constructive dialogue can originate between all participating parties which can contribute to the understanding of shareholders concerning the proposed decision-making. When shareholders have taken a voting decision, they can cast their votes at a separate part of the platform. All participants within the corporation, wherever they reside, are able to join the assembly at a relatively low cost. Since a VGM may last for several days, it is not required that the shareholders are all in front of their computers at the same time. The VGM has three clear advantages: 1. Savings in costs and time. Shareholders can save travelling time while corporations can save on organisation and location costs. Although establishing and using a VGM platform will be costly, a surplus will remain. It is no longer necessary for shareholders and members of the board to reserve a specific day in their diary. In order to follow and participate in the discussion, they only need to log on to the VGM platform on a regular basis. This will most likely result in time savings, but allows shareholders in any event to use their assembly time more flexibly. 2. The second advantage is an improvement in corporate <b>democracy.</b> <b>Shareholders,</b> wherever they reside, are able to join the meeting at relatively low costs. The thresholds for joining the assembly are lowered which may lead to an increase in the representation and participation of shareholders in the decision-making process. Due to the low costs of information distribution, the supply of information may increase and the information asymmetry will diminish. Moreover, the discussion forum offers shareholders new possibilities to provide each other with information and to unite. Shareholders will not receive additional rights, but will be able to exercise their existing rights in a more informed and balanced way. As a result of the more informed and balanced exercise of rights, the antagonism may diminish and the VGM may be, next to face-to-face contact at investor relation meetings, a platform for constructive dialogue between shareholders and members of the board. 3. The third advantage is an improvement in corporate governance. The consequence of a VGM is an improved corporate democracy which enables AGMs to play the role which the legislator and Code intended them to play. If the AGM will indeed fulfil this role, corporate governance will improve...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} long-standing {{suspicion}} {{of the individual}} shareholder and the corresponding ambivalence about <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> as it is seen in conversations about the shareholder 2 ̆ 7 s role in the modern public corporation throughout the twentieth century. The article examines two competing conceptions of the shareholder 2 ̆ 7 s role in the corporation: one focuses {{on the role of}} shareholders as investors, the other emphasizes the role of shareholders as potential participants in corporate management. I argue that scholars and reformers who have conceived of shareholders as investors limited the locus of <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> to the market. The writings of Louis Brandeis, Henry Manne, and Chancellor Allen offer examples of this vision. At the same time, scholars and reformers who argued that shareholders should have {{a more active role in}} corporate management (including William Ripley, Adolf Berle, William Douglas, and the early New Dealers) were reluctant to give shareholders meaningful access to the corporate decision-making processes. They feared not only that shareholders were too passive to participate in corporate management, but also that they could not be trusted to make the correct decisions. For the most part, these scholars ended up using the rhetoric of <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> (and the shareholders) as a proxy to achieving other goals. In the course of the twentieth century, these scholars 2 ̆ 7 goals shifted from taming the power of the control group to constraining management to legitimating managerial power. More important, because they refused truly to empower shareholders, these scholars 2 ̆ 7 attempts presumably to promote <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> ultimately emptied the idea of <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> of content.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> {{has been the}} center of {{attention}} in corporate governance research. Academic commentators have lined up {{on both sides of the}} debate and have fiercely advocated either increasing or limiting shareholder power. Yet, the scope of many of these arguments has so far been unclear, so that they could in fact always be used again for even more, or even less, <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy,</b> until the board or the shareholder meeting is entirely depleted of authority. This article explores the dividing line between shareholder say and board autonomy in public companies and puts forward a normative criterion that can be consistently applied to the various subject matters of corporate decision-making. A criterion based on “inherent” conflicts of interest of directors, I argue, is economically efficient and meets the underlying rationale of existing corporate law systems in Europe and the United States. Specifically, shareholder power should comprise, but also be limited to, matters in which directors face an inherent conflict of interest. The problems of shareholder passivity, short-termism and empty voting and the concern about stakeholder interests do not call for a further reduction of shareholder power beyond this limitation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Never has voting {{been more}} {{important}} in corporate law. With greater activism among shareholders and the shift from plurality to majority voting for directors, the number of close votes is rising. But is the basic technology of corporate voting adequate to the task? In this Article, we first examine the incredibly complicated system of US corporate voting, a complexity that {{is driven by the}} underlying custodial ownership structure, by dispersed ownership and large trading volumes, and by the rise in short-selling and derivatives. We identify three ways in which things predictably go wrong: pathologies of complexity; pathologies of ownership; and pathologies of misalignment of interests. We then discuss the current legal treatment of these pathologies and consider a variety of directions for reform, ranging from incremental modifications to fundamental redesign. We show that, absent a fundamental reconstruction of the ownership structure, the existing system will continue to be noisy, imprecise and disturbingly opaque. The problems with the existing system pose fundamental challenges for both proponents of direct <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy,</b> who advocate more extensive voting rights for shareholders, and for proponents of indirect <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy,</b> who advocate deference to a board of directors the legitimacy of which ultimately also rests on shareholder elections...|$|E

40|$|Democracy and {{participation}} of shareholders or {{the demand for}} their active participation in the meetings of the Assemblyhas increasingly gained in importance in modern conditions. This is because, negative trends of passivation, the limitations of democratic potential of shareholders and shareholders' rights abuse by the management body, especially in the work control and compensation policy of shareholders, have been observed in {{a detailed analysis of}} the application and results of the Shareholder Rights Directive. The passivity of shareholders, {{as one of the most}} striking features of their position in the joint stock company today, is the biggest problem and threat to democratic processes within the company. If we bear in mind that the most common definition of <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> is 'ability of shareholders to influence the management of the company', we can notice a clear picture of the seriousness and importance of the lack of shareholder participation. This is the reason why the author of this paper gradually examines the causes and consequences of the passivity of shareholders, the proposed changes in this context in the Law of the European Union and the practical implications of such solutions in practice. In addition, the author examines contemporary forms and conditions for <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> and the legal framework in the European Union and the Republic of Serbia. In this way, we analyze the situation in this area and point out shortcomings of certain solutions, as well as the implications they cause in practice. The main thesis from which starts the scientific work and which will be gradually proven through theoretical and practical analysis is that the wider social processes directly reflect on the state of the joint-stock companies, or the state of corporate governance. This means that the negative trends of modern democracy (in the constitutional sense) are almost mirrored in economic capital (EC) and our attempt in this paper is to prove that, through the analysis of existing solutions. On the other hand, some solutions of <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> are applicable in terms of contemporary socio-political relations and can produce a certain positive impact on the democratic processes...|$|E
40|$|We analyze Berle’s overall {{corporate}} governance project {{in accordance with}} what we see as its four core sub-themes: (A) the limitations of external market forces as a constraint on managerial decision-making power; (B) the desirability of internal (corporate) over external (market) actors in allocating corporate capital; (C) civil society and the public consensus as a continuous informal check on managerial decision-making power; and (D) <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> (as opposed to shareholder primacy or shareholder wealth maximization) as a socially instrumental institution. We seek to debunk the popular misconception that Berle’s early work was a defense of the orthodox shareholder primacy paradigm of {{corporate governance}}. This prefaces our analysis where we set out and, in turn, examine each of the above four sub-themes of Berle’s overall thinking on corporate governance. A recurring theme {{in this part of}} our discussion is the over-simplicity of attempting to connect Berle’s thinking to the later agency costs paradigm of corporate governance, which we believe fails to reflect the normative and institutional richness of Berle’s overall social-scientific project. We build on these insights by assessing the effects of our reinterpretation of Berle’s work on contemporary corporate governance debates. We suggest here that Berle’s lifetime work on corporate governance, when considered in an integral and non-selective way, provides the basis for a realistic and dynamic understanding of the concept of <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> and its relationship with wider civil society processes of public and political opinion formation...|$|E

In the system, the responsibility for voting the shares of a firm (“voice”) is given to the people who ultimately provided the money, who, however, have to delegate it to proxy voting institutions. The system helps overcome collective action problems and conflicts of interest within firms, and it reduces the private benefits of control. The disadvantages for firm governance may be relatively modest. However, since the new system of voice is a conceptual innovation, the analysis of its effects is rather tentative.

40|$|International audienceMinority {{investors are}} gaining greater {{shareholder}} protection in France, a civil law {{country with a}} strong coordinated market economy (CME), due {{to the evolution of}} institutional and legal contexts. We demonstrated how this occurred over time with special attention to the development of foreign investors and the consequent improvments in corporate governance and <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> in France. However, in CMEs there are national limits to this global convergence to improved minority investor protection. By highlighting the distinctive role of French legal investor associations; by emphasizing the roles of new actors in <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy,</b> namely proxy advisers, hedge funds, and SRI funds; and by focusing on the responses of local French actors, we illustrated how the tension between shareholders and stakeholders raises the unanticipated costs of shareholder activism. We illustrated through several case examples of explicit and evasive reactions to shareholder activism how the French government, business elites and unions respond to these global trends. We concluded that France is a hybrid model where shareholder activism is more unpredictable in CMEs due to stakeholder resistance. Our research provided an in-depth investigation of how shareholder activism performs outside liberal market economies with common law. After reading our paper, financial practitioners and investors would understand better the limits to exercising the rights attached to the shares that they acquire in French companies, and more broadly, outside commom law countries. They would assess more carefully the risks from stakeholders in CMEs, thereby enabling them to seek additional strategies to protect their minority shareholder investments...|$|E
40|$|Corporate law is {{consumed}} with {{a debate over}} <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy.</b> The conventional wisdom counsels that shareholders should have more voice in corporate governance, {{in order to reduce}} agency costs and provide democratic legitimacy. A second set of theorists, described as “board primacists,” advocates against greater <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> and in favor of increased board discretion. These theorists argue that shareholders need to delegate their authority in order to provide the board with the proper authority to manage the enterprise and avoid short-term decision making. In the last few years, the classical economic underpinnings of corporate law have been destabilized by a growing recognition that shareholders are not a homogeneous group of wealth maximizers. This recognition has, among other things, undercut the arguments made in support of the typical corporate structure where shareholders alone possess the right to vote in corporate elections. Board primacy seems well-positioned to retheorize corporate law to adapt to this new reality. In their analyses of the issue, however, board primacy theorists have conflated two very different aspects of group decision processes: the responsiveness of the governance system and the composition of the electorate. This confusion ends up putting many board primacy theorists in the curious position of moving away from the public choice emphasis on preference aggregation toward a more civic republican model of less responsive, more deliberative decision making. By restricting the franchise, board primacists have detached their governance structures from the underlying desires of their constituents without substituting anything in their place. We argue, however, that the breakdown of this particular distinction between shareholders and other constituents could mean that we should investigate treating other constituents more like shareholders, {{rather than the other way}} around...|$|E
40|$|Typically, {{shareholders}} are {{not sure}} whether boards act in their interest, or have been captured by management.

We develop a model, consistent with these observations, in which discretionary compensation payments to managers might increase firm value or might simply enrich managers {{at the expense of}} shareholders. After observing the board’s compensation and investment policies, shareholders update the probability that the board is captured using Bayes rule. Shareholders are “outraged” if this updated probability is sufficiently large.

The findings suggest a positive association among democratic corporate governance, the willingness of corporate alliance partners to accept institutionalized ties, and the creation of an environment conducive to commercial investment commitments through alliances.

40|$|A {{shareholder}} {{that combines}} {{long and short}} positions for risk-hedging purposes may distort corporate decision-making and weaken <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> by reinventing the shareholder status and transforming voting rights into a malleable instrument. This paper endeavours to challenge this canonical view by also examining a market efficiency perspective that favours such mixed long/short positions. By acknowledging that initiatives with a ‘value decreasing’ objective are not necessarily a feature of short-selling, since they may also derive from shareholders with exclusively long positions, the paper asserts that the arguments based on corporate governance concerns as an additional reason to set or strengthen short seller duties become therefore weaker. Our approach obviously cannot predict to what extent scandals may (or may not) erupt in the future since manipulative behaviour with a ‘risk-free’ allure cannot be ruled out. However, lacking substantial evidence for widespread manipulative transactions {{in the area of}} short selling, any further imposition of duties or restriction of rights (such as shareholder disenfranchisement) would be unduly burdensome and counter-productive.

According to Canadian taxfiler data, {{over the}} last thirty years there has been a surge in the income shares of the top 1 %, top 0. 1 % and top 0. 01 % of income recipients, even with {{longitudinal}} smoothing by individual using three- or five-year moving averages. Top shares fell in 2008 and 2009, but only by a fraction of the overall surge. Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario have much more pronounced surges than other provinces.

40|$|The {{proposal}} by the European Commission (EC) to establish <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> and mandate the one-share-one-vote (1 S 1 V) rule has drawn much attention and controversy. In {{the pursuit of}} enhancing the rule’s popular appeal, EC policy-makers have tried to make equiproportional representation nearly an aphorism tied to corporate egalitarian sentiments underscoring justice, fairness and ethics. Against this background, {{the question of who}} could be against or oppose <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> and the 1 S 1 V principle has both positive and normative implications. Based on a review of law, finance and economics literature, this paper evaluates the economic underpinnings and efficiency of the 1 S 1 V rule and concludes that it is generally a suboptimal corporate voting mechanism that compromises economic efficiency and distorts the incentives of corporate constituencies. Moreover, it is submitted that any attempt to mandate the 1 S 1 V rule in the EU may induce companies to either move to pyramidal structures, or worse yet, to use complex derivative instruments to decompose 1 S 1 V. While pyramidal holdings may further facilitate the expropriation of private benefits of control as compared with the status-quo, the decomposition of 1 S 1 V can i) advance the heterogeneity of shareholders’ preferences, ii) create incentives for negative voting arbitrage and iii) encourage the approval of value-reducing transactions, or more detrimentally, become a takeover defence. Hence, even if the EC could hypothetically move corporate Europe from controlled ownership structures to minority ownership ones, the 1 S 1 V rule is clearly worse than the status quo, and paradoxically, instead of advancing the rights of ‘disadvantaged shareholders’, 1 S 1 V can further demote shareholder rights in the EU. As a result, 1 S 1 V cannot promote a value-enhancing corporate governance regime in the EU in general or meet the policy objectives of the intervention in particular in terms of strengthening the rights of shareholders, enhancing third-party protection or fostering the efficiency and competitiveness of businesses in the EU. On the normative side, the issue is how corporate law can efficiently police the ability of controlling shareholders to expropriate rights from minority shareholders in general and extract private benefits in particular. Generally, it is asserted that if a corporate law regime is adequately structured, there is less need to worry about the voting rule and non-proportionate votes would not be a serious concern. In this light, this paper concludes by outlining some policy alternatives. First, it is proposed that EC policy-makers refrain from taking any measure {{at the level of the}} Community and instead strengthen disclosure rules and their enforcement. Furthermore, some standards of review governing significant conflict-of-interest transactions can be introduced. Second, it is submitted that EC policy-makers can also provide for opt-in and opt-out provisions for the member states. Such menus should once again be complemented by rigorous disclosure rules and their enforcement...|$|E
40|$|Recent cases – Burwell v Hobby Lobby Stores and Citizens United {{chief among}} them – evince a new {{understanding}} of the nature of the corporation and its place in society. Whether a corporation has rights – such as those of religious exercise – is not, however, just a question of legal interpretation. To answer this question requires a theory of group or cultural identity, that is, a theory of how a group may have “culture” separate and apart from those of the individuals that comprise it. And such a theory must address how to understand the meaning of culture when the beliefs of people within the group diverge. However, the Supreme Court’s analysis has fallen short by glossing over this step in the analysis. In Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court indicated that the question of the religious identity of the corporation might easily be resolved by the semi-democracy of state corporate law: those shareholders and managers controlling the corporation, that is, decide the identity of the corporation. As Justice Ginsburg noted in her dissent, however, in the case of religious belief, things can get fairly gnarly. This Article critiques the Supreme Court’s oversimplified view of how group identity is formed using anthropology as its guide. This anthropological approach argues that the question of corporate “culture” is far more complex than the Court’s jurisprudence acknowledges. This approach requires rethinking the corporate rights doctrine and its assumptions about <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy.</b> One or the other must fall – either the notion that corporations have cultural rights such as those of a “religion,” or the processes of majority shareholder voting that do not track an ingrained cultural identity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> has blossomed. The once moribund {{shareholder}} franchise is now {{critical in}} takeover contests, merger decisions, and board oversight. However, {{the mechanisms of}} this vote remain largely undertheorized. In this Article, we use voting rights and social choice theory {{to develop a new}} approach to the corporate franchise. Political democracies typically tie the right to vote {{to the level of a}} person 2 ̆ 7 s interest in the outcome of the election. Corporate democracies, on the other hand, tend to define the requisite institutional interest quite narrowly, and thus restrict the right to vote to shareholders alone. This restriction has found its justification in the assumption that shareholders have a homogeneous interest in corporate wealth maximization. Such homogeneity, it is argued, maximizes efficient preference satisfaction. This assumption of shareholder homogeneity is false. It is becoming increasing clear, for example, that shareholders have many different types of interests in a corporation. In addition, stakeholders such as employees, consumers, and creditors also have interests in corporate governance that are not currently captured through existing contractual regimes. Moreover, many of the conclusions drawn from the assumption of shareholder homogeneity are either based on dated understandings of Arrow 2 ̆ 7 s Theorem or, in some cases, are flat out inconsistent with the standard economic theory that they purport to embody. As a result, corporate voting schemes are sterile reflections of their more robust political counterparts. The Article argues that corporate law scholars should acknowledge the weaknesses of shareholder voting theory and should examine new ways of translating the preferences of corporate participants into a governance structure...|$|E

The system is a semi-personal exchange, repeated game that helps to offset the three fundamental conflicts of principal-agency in {{corporate governance}}. From an architectural perspective, the U. S. system is a model-reference adaptive control system with three feedback mechanisms (the stock market, the material disclosure system, and the proxy solicitation system) that admit shareholder criticism (exit, voice, and precatory judgment). Constructive shareholder criticism pushes firms to adapt, brings problems to their boards ' attention, and prods their managers {{to solve the problems}} early on before they fester and grow. The U. S. system relies on fiduciaries (outside directors) and professionals (public auditors). The current crisis of investor confidence can be attributed to their failure to carry out their public responsibilities, which has significantly increased the measurement and enforcement costs of public equity ownership. Representative democracy provides for the economizing of virtue. Restoring investor confidence will require the continual reinforcement of aspirational preferences for virtuous conduct by fiduciaries and professionals. The current crisis can also be attributed to the inability of corporations in economic distress to problem-solve. Representative democracy also facilitates problem-solving through time. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the U. S. corporate governance system (Allen, 1999) from the perspectives of North’s framework of institutional analysis (1990 a) and Popper’s political philosophy of open society (1944 a-b), (1988). Along the lines of a recently proposed problem-solving model of economic behavior (Mantzavinos, 2001), open society is based on the adaptive behavior paradigm (Popper, 1994) : “All life is problem-solving. ” The paradigm can be summarized by Popper’s four-stage methodology of science (1979) ...|$|E
40|$|Corporate law and {{scholarship}} generally assume that professional managers control public corporations, while shareholders play only a weak and passive role. As a result, corporate officers and directors are {{understood to be}} subject to extensive fiduciary duties, while shareholders traditionally have been thought to have far more limited obligations. Outside the contexts of controlling shareholders and closely held firms, many experts argue shareholders have no duties at all. The most important trend in corporate governance today, however, is the move toward 2 ̆ 2 <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy.</b> 2 ̆ 2 Changes in financial markets, in business practice, and in corporate law have given minority shareholders in public companies greater power than they have ever enjoyed before. Activist investors, especially rapidly growing hedge funds, are using this new power to pressure managers into pursuing corporate transactions ranging from share repurchases, to special dividends, to the sale of assets or even the entire firm. In many cases these transactions uniquely benefit the activist while failing to benefit, or even harming, the firm and other shareholders. This Article argues that greater shareholder power should be coupled with greater shareholder responsibility. In particular, it argues that the rules of fiduciary duty traditionally applied to officers and directors and, more rarely, to controlling shareholders should be applied to activist minority investors as well. This proposal may seem a radical expansion of fiduciary doctrine. Nonetheless, the foundations of an expanded shareholder duty have been laid in existing case law. Moreover, {{there is every reason to}} believe that newly empowered activist shareholders are vulnerable to the same forces of greed and self-interest widely understood to face corporate officers and directors. Corporate law can, and should, adapt to this reality...|$|E
40|$|In 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considered, and {{ultimately}} rejected, {{a rule that}} would have required corporations to include shareholder-nominated candidates on the ballot. This Article seeks to ascertain {{the impact of this}} rejection. On the one hand, the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s rejection appears to be a stunning blow to the shareholders 2 ̆ 7 rights campaign. This is because many shareholders 2 ̆ 7 rights advocates have long considered access to the corporate ballot as the 2 ̆ 2 holy grail 2 ̆ 2 of their campaign for increased shareholder power. Such advocates believe that access to the corporate ballot is critical to ensuring that shareholders can participate legitimately in the corporate electoral process and thereby influence corporate affairs. On the other hand, some corporate experts contend that the SEC 2 ̆ 7 rejection should not be viewed as a major setback. Such experts maintain that characterizingp roxy access as {{the sine qua non of}} shareholder influence fails to appreciate the significance of recent developments, such as the success of majority voting and the adoption of the e-proxy rules. Because these developments provide shareholders with alternative methods for influencing corporate affairs, some have even argued that they may make the issue of proxy access moot. This Article reveals the fallacies of such an argument, and hence the importance of the continued pursuit of proxy access. Indeed, after carefully considering the impact of such developments, and critically examining the probable impact of proxy access on shareholders 2 ̆ 7 efforts to enhance their influence on corporate governance, this Article concludes that although other devices may prove useful, it is not likely that they will be as effective as proxy access in empowering shareholders. I n this respect,future <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> campaigns must continue to focus on the historical battle for proxy access...|$|E
40|$|Dieser Text beschreibt eine explorative Vorstudie zu den politisch-institutionellen Determinanten aktionärsorientierter Reformen im Vergleich von 21 OECD-Ländern. Als abhängige Variablen dienen Daten zur Entwicklung der Marktkapitalisierungen sowie der La-Porta-et-al. -Index, der die Reichweite von Aktionärsrechten abbildet. Es werden Stocks für die Jahre 1990 und 2000 bzw. 2002 sowie Flows für die neunziger Jahre untersucht. Sechs Gruppen potenziell erklärungskräftiger Variablen werden unterschieden: (1) wirtschaftliche, (2) strukturelle, (3) kulturelle Variablen; (4) parteipolitische Regierungszusammensetzung; (5) verhandlungsdemokratische Institutionen; sowie (6) Arbeitsbeziehungen. Es zeigt sich ein enger Zusammenhang zwischen aktionärsorientierten Reformen und dem Stellenwert privater Altersvorsorge. Noch 1990 standen vor allem konservative und liberale Regierungen für ausgebaute, katholische Länder hingegen für schwach entwickelte Aktionärsrechte; diese Zusammenhänge haben sich in den neunziger Jahren abgeschwächt. Wegen geringer Reformtätigkeit in den nordischen Ländern wiesen sozialdemokratisch geprägte Länder im Jahr 2000 vergleichsweise schwache Aktionärsrechte auf. Reformen fielen umso weit reichender aus, je pluralistischer die Interessengruppensysteme der betreffenden Länder organisiert waren. Diese vorläufigen Ergebnisse werden genutzt, um weiteren Forschungsbedarf zu identifizieren, der im Rahmen eines größeren Projektzusammenhangs abzuarbeiten ist. Forschungsbedarf liegt vor allem in der Erfassung und Codierung weiterer Dimensionen der Unternehmenskontrolle wie der Übernahmeregulierung und der Aktionärsdemokratie. This text is a {{preliminary}} {{study on the}} political-institutional determinants of shareholder oriented reforms in 21 OECD countries. I analyse stock and flow data {{on the development of}} stock market capitalization and on the rights of minority shareholders (La Porta et al. index) between 1990 and 2000 respective 2002. Six groups of dependent variables are distinguished: (1) economic, (2) structural, (3) cultural variables; (4) the political composition of governments; (5) institutions of consociational democracy and (6) labor relations. The analysis shows that there is a strong empirical relationship between shareholder oriented reforms and the importance of private pension schemes. In 1990, high shareholder protection was typical for countries with conservative and liberal governments, while low shareholder protection was a particular feature of catholic countries. This empirical relationship declined during the 1990 s. As a consequence of weak reforms in the Nordic countries, minority shareholder protection in the year 2000 was comparatively low in countries governed by Social Democratic parties. Reforms went further in pluralist rather than corporatist countries. I use these preliminary results to identify further need for research. Most urgently, more comparative indexes on corporate governance features - such as takeover regulation and <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> - need to be developed.

40|$|The {{balance of}} power is {{particularly}} at stake in hostile takeovers, which makes the issue of establishing the {{balance of power}} {{one of the most controversial}} issues in the contemporary company law. In the circumstances of direct market competition and the need to have a dominant market position, companies are necessarily forced to constantly upgrade and advance their offensive and defensive methods, techniques and strategies. In order to prevent a hostile takeover, the target company may resort to an array of defence mechanisms, the most prominent of which are 'poison pills'. In spite of being perceived as the most powerful tool for obstructing hostile takeovers (and commonly designated as the 'Holy Grail' among the defensive mechanisms), there are many pros and cons underlying their application. One of the positive effects of using the poison pills is that the fear of takeovers makes the target company management more disciplined and efficient in business operations. The negative consequences are reflected in the relationship between the company board of directors and the shareholders. The target company management makes a unilateral decision on using a poison pill and this decision does not have to be approved by the shareholders in the General Meeting; however, this is highly inconsistent with the basic principles of corporate governance. The asymmetry of information, where the management (an agent) has disproportionately more relevant information at its disposal than the shareholders (principals), generates a conflict between the management and the shareholders. In company law, this agency problem is generally known as the principal-agent problem, which is most prominent in a takeover. Poison pills are often associated with the discrimination of the target company shareholders, but not necessarily. The controversial nature of this defensive measure which can be applied by the target company has given rise to numerous debates on the need to control the use of poison pills and their impact on <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in direct personal investment in capital market assets by Australians {{over the past}} two decades represents an unprecedented engagement with that sector of Australian economic life. This dissertation critically investigates claims that this engagement heralds a <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy.</b> Increased economic participation based on private direct ownership of corporate securities could be interpreted as a weak form of democratisation. Using a class-theoretical framework, the dissertation conceptualises the private shareholder phenomenon as a process of embourgeoisement and argues that the development of a macro-level mass consumer financial products market is the result of capitalist class development and expansion. A thesis of strong democratisation proffers the notion that the private shareholder, as an ascendant class of financial actor, engages with real democratic processes in addition to simply owning securities. To test this thesis the dissertation measures the extent to which small shareholders control the objective conditions under which they accumulate greater wealth by seeking evidence of potential or actual engagement with macro-market and meso-corporate level social processes. The dissertation assesses macro-level practice by drawing on the work of Bourdieu and on notions of the social field. It considers the entry of the new class of financial actor to the financial field and analyses their capacity to accumulate and deploy informational capital, and compares their ability to influence a state-sponsored economic reform process (CLERP) with that of other actors. The dissertation analyses longitudinal ownership and shareholder voting data from a set of over 30 major Australian companies. It finds that the new class of economic actor is most prevalent in privatised state-owned enterprises and mutuals. In the context of an ideal Habermasian public sphere, the study considers the potential for small shareholders to participate in meso-level, corporate agenda-setting and deliberation. Using the ideal political space of Arendt, it searches for methods of achieving democratic outcomes. The dissertation finds that while the personal ownership of tradable financial assets may constitute a weak form of economic democratisation, small shareholders&# 146; inability to influence real outcomes, even in companies in which they constitute the majority, places substantial restrictions on the overall strength of the share ownership-as-democracy thesis...|$|E
40|$|In a {{forthcoming}} Virginia Law Review article, Professor Lucian Bebchuk {{argues that the}} notion that shareholders in public corporations {{have the power to}} remove directors is a myth. This is perhaps an overstatement, but Bebchuk is correct to suggest that in a public company with widely dispersed share ownership, it is difficult and expensive for shareholders to overcome obstacles to collective action and wage a proxy battle to oust an incumbent board. Nor is success likely when directors can use corporate funds to solicit proxies to stay in place. The end result, as Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means famously observed in their 1932 book The Modern Corporation and Private Property, is that shareholders in American public corporations are 2 ̆ 2 subservient 2 ̆ 2 to directors 2 ̆ 2 who can employ the proxy machinery to become a self-perpetuating body. 2 ̆ 2 So not only is shareholder control largely a myth in public companies, it has been recognized to be largely a myth for at least three-quarters of a century. What should we conclude from this? Bebchuk concludes {{that the time has come}} to breathe life into the idea of the shareholder-controlled public firm. But there are many myths—vampires, zombies, giant alligators in the sewers of New York City—that we would not want to make real. Would greater shareholder power to oust directors be a similar monster? An extensive literature on the theory of the corporation suggests that shareholders enjoy net benefits from board governance. Board governance, while worsening agency costs, also promotes efficient and informed decisionmaking, discourages inter-shareholder opportunism, and encourages valuable specific investment in corporate team production. Because board control has both costs and benefits, the wisdom of Bebchuk 2 ̆ 7 s proposal to make it easier for shareholders to oust directors must be based on evidence, and the empirical evidence strongly supports the claim that shareholders themselves often prefer firms with strong board control. Why, then, do so many observers believe shareholders should be given greater influence over boards? Calls for greater 2 ̆ 2 <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy</b> 2 ̆ 2 have emotional appeal to laymen, the business media, and even many business experts. The emotional appeal of shareholder control can be traced to three sources: a common but misleading metaphor that describes shareholders as the 2 ̆ 2 owners 2 ̆ 2 of corporations; the opportunistic calls of activist shareholders seeking leverage over boards for self-interested reasons; and a strong but unfocused sense that something (anything!) should be done in the wake of recent corporate scandals. The result has been a widespread, and unfortunate, acceptance of yet another myth—the myth that shareholder control of public corporations actually benefits shareholders...|$|E
40|$|In Australia, the strata {{mechanism}} is used {{with increasing frequency}} by developers as the primary method for division of real property assets and on-sale of individual property lots. Any land that falls within the strata scheme but outside the individually owned lots is termed the common property. Individual lot owners have right of access {{and use of the}} common property. They are also legally tied to the common property and responsible for its maintenance. To facilitate the maintenance, upkeep, access and use, a committee of management is required. While some research has been undertaken into strata issues within the states of Queensland and New South Wales, little is known of the Victorian or Tasmanian context. Fewer studies still concentrate on the committee of management and their interaction with strata managers, even within the international sphere. The privatised governance structures within apartment and townhouse developments have evolved into complex organisations that make consequential decisions that affect property owners. This thesis examines the growth of the strata industry and the influence that strata managers have over committees of management. Issues of trust, participation, openness and transparency in this contractual relationship are investigated. The thesis also investigates the links that strata managers have with developers and how this shapes the owner corporation. While the growth in strata titled properties can be understood as a legal or planning issue, this thesis seeks to contribute to our understanding of how these non-profit organisations, relying on volunteer labour, are managed as part of a <b>shareholder</b> <b>democracy.</b> Within the Australian context, the owner corporation is shaped and constrained by wider society through the taxation system and wider economic context. The thesis also looks critically at the organisations‟ capacity to govern by drawing on qualitative interviews with strata managers and committees of management. This approach highlights {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} externally sourced, contractual help within the strata environment. The thesis considers the implications of this empirical, sociologically informed approach for studying strata title. Theoretical insights were gained through the application of structuration theory in order to investigate the actions taken by different stakeholders, and the reflexive monitoring that occurs within strata organisations. The power plays (and therefore conflict) identified in the interviews are then investigated further through using the concepts of coercive, mimetic and normative forms of isomorphism employed by new institutionalists. This thesis demonstrates that developers have a great deal of influence on committees of management through their role in establishing these organisations, but that managers exercise agency while working within these structures. The thesis also advances some policy recommendations for the strata industry suggested by the empirical research. These include the need to address the lack of purchaser knowledge; the need for owners, strata managers and committees of management to understand trust, conflict and training issues; the need to address the complexities of upgrading buildings particularly where environmentally sustainable retrofitting occurs; and the need to understand the impact of various tenancy types on the functioning of the owner corporation...|$|E
40|$|More {{than one}} third of {{companies}} listed in the FTSE EUROFIRST 300 index are governed accordingly to principles differing from the One share – One vote standards. These exceptions could be illustrated by several practices such as Scandinavian multiple voting shares, non voting shares as seen in some State members as authorised by European Directives, French double voting shares, “golden shares” concerning recently privatized firms, or even preference shares as observed in Holland. Such variety {{can be explained by}} the fact that “control rights” and “cash-flow rights”, understood as essential to the company's activities, are distinctly considered in the shareholder practices. The question at stake is to know if the application of the One share – One vote as a European standard would be justified with regard to European Law, including its underlying principles, and to economic efficiency in general. Indeed, One share – One vote enthusiast affirm that this rule participates to corporate democracy and contributes to increases firms' performance. The aim of our study is to determine whether these principles are reached or not. As a preliminary remark, we can notice that the European Commission intervention is questionable. First, its competence, and therefore the legality of a potential action, is not obvious. Indeed, owing to the subsidiarity principle and the article 48. 2 : (“co-ordinating to the necessary extent the safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies or firms, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the Community”.) and the European Parliament position concerning the Takeover Directive, the legitimacy of the European Commission in this case is undoubtedly compromised. Then, the application of One share - One vote, by the cancellation of certain rights attached to a share, would violate a democratic principle, founder of the European Union, and dedicated by Member States Constitutions, known as private property. It would have, as a result, an unjustified, not compensable and therefore, illegal expropriation. We also have to question ourselves concerning the concept of corporate democracy and its consequences on Europeans companies. Unquestionable at first glance, is the notion of democracy transposable it in corporate Law? Is it only referring to a strict equality between shareholders or rather intents to limit unequal situations and therefore, prevent dominant shareholders from unilaterally capturing the company's performance? The respect of principles such as equity, shareholders general interest and company's interest, combined with transparency rules and protection of minority shareholders leads us to favour the second supposition. Finally, we underline that the ultimate argument relating to efficiency as a result from the strict application of the One share – One vote rule, is tempered by economical studies and by the practice observed in several State members. The One share - One vote rule could definitely be necessary for market readability purposes. But, some exception to this rule might be justified with regard to the company's interest. Therefore, some flexibility principles should remain. A dogmatic approach focused on shareholders, or certain type of shareholders, would disadvantage the development of the internal market and could not be justifiable on a legal ground. We believe that promoting corporate democracy requests an enhancement of transparency with a better bordering of existing practices and a strengthening of minority shareholders (by improving an “upper standard” harmonization).
