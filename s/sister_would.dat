5|$|Only a {{few months}} later, on 14 December 1861, Albert died at Windsor Castle. During his final illness, Alice {{remained}} at his bedside. Alice sent for the Prince of Wales by telegram, without {{the knowledge of the}} Queen, who refused to notify him because she blamed him for Albert's death. The Queen was distraught by her husband's death, and the court entered a period of intense mourning. Alice became her mother's unofficial secretary, and for the next six months, the physical representation of the monarch. Through her passed the Queen's official papers to and from her government ministers, while the Queen secluded herself from all public life. Alice was aided in this task by her younger sister Princess Louise. Although Princess Helena, Louise's elder <b>sister,</b> <b>would</b> normally have been selected to assist, her inability to go long without crying was held against her.|$|E

None of his siblings are a tissue match, so Ash, Adi and Kareena visit their mother, but her kidney is not a match either. Tariq is forced to reveal that he is Dan's son, and he donates his kidney to Ronny. He explains that he thought having a mildly romantic relationship with his half <b>sister</b> <b>would</b> bring him closer to the family. Adi dislikes the fact he and Tariq are half brothers, but mellows towards him eventually. When bailiffs arrive to evict the family from their home, they board themselves into their living room, but eventually admit defeat and move into a flat with Sasha, starting a minicab firm called Toucan Cars.|$|E

25|$|The {{death of}} John's sister Teresa Maria in February 1704, greatly saddened him. It {{caused him to}} avoid {{appearing}} at court for some months and to estrange himself from his father, who favoured John's younger brother, Manuel, Count of Ourém. During this time, much gossip was spread and worries arose about whether John would ever recover from his depression. In May of that year, he eventually returned to the court and reconciled with the king, saying that his saudades for his <b>sister</b> <b>would</b> not {{get in the way}} of his performing his duty to the king.|$|E
25|$|According to a custom, {{it would}} be a disgrace if a younger <b>sister</b> <b>would</b> marry before the elder sister. Therefore, Sophia's older sister Vasilisa was married off to Ivan Bielski, son of Jogaila's {{half-brother}} Vladimir Olgerdovich, in 1421. In February 1422, Sophia was baptized in the Roman Catholic rite (Sophia is her Catholic baptismal name). The wedding ceremony, carried out by Matthias of Trakai, Bishop of Samogitia, took place in Navahrudak on February 7 or 24. However, her coronation as Queen of Poland took place two years later, on March 5, 1424. This delay is explained by resistance from the Polish nobility and rather distant relationship between Sophia and Jogaila.|$|E

25|$|In August 1901, Zephyr was {{commissioned}} at Devonport by {{the officers and}} crew of the destroyer , whose place she took as instructional tender to Cambridge, gunnery school ship, and {{took part in the}} 1901 Naval Manoeuvres. Although contemporary reports suggested that Zephyr and her <b>sister</b> <b>would</b> be allocated to the Australian station, the two ships served their whole career in British waters. Zephyr served in the Portsmouth instructional flotilla until she was paid off at Portsmouth in April 1902, and docked to be strengthened, after she and her sister suffered hull damage below the waterline while being driven into a head sea in heavy weather in the English Channel. Lieutenant George Norman Ballard was appointed in command on 21 June 1902, and she took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII. Two years later, on 18 August 1904 Zephyr was rammed by Torpedo Boat No. 68 in Portsmouth Harbour and holed below the waterline by the torpedo boat's ram, flooding Zephyrs engine room. The torpedo boat was undamaged.Zephyr was involved in another collision on 4 February 1908 when she struck the Cricket-class coastal destroyer TB 2 in Portsmouth harbour, holing TB 2 s hull and forcing her to be docked for repair.|$|E
25|$|Galitsky's {{followers}} sing his praise. Skula and Yeroshka are {{now working}} as gudok-players. They entertain the followers and all sing of how Galitsky and his men abducted a young woman and how she pleaded {{to be allowed to}} return to her father without being dishonoured. The prince arrives and sings of how, if he were Prince of Putivl, he would drink and feast all day while dispensing judgment and have the prettiest maidens with him all night (Galitsky's Song). The treasury would be spent on himself and his men while his <b>sister</b> <b>would</b> be praying in a monastery. A group of young women beg the prince to restore their abducted friend. He threatens them and drives them away, saying how she now lives in luxury in his quarters and does not have to work. The prince returns to his rooms having sent for wine for his followers. The gudok players and the prince's followers mock the women. They wonder what might happen if Yaroslavna hears of what happens, but then realise she would be helpless with all her men gone to war. They sing of how they are all drunkards and are supported by Galitsky. The men decide to go to the town square to declare Galitsky the Prince of Putivl, leaving just the two drunk musicians behind.|$|E

500|$|The subplot with Stan getting beat up by {{his sister}} Shelley came from Parker's real-life {{experiences}} getting beat up as a child by his sister, also named Shelley, who is three years his elder. Parker said although his <b>sister</b> <b>would</b> later deny it, she regularly beat him up or locked {{him out of the}} house for hours; Parker stated that the scene when Stan says [...] "You're my sister and I love you" [...] in order to try to avoid a beating, but was subsequently beat even harder, was based on an actual experience with his sister. The scene in which Stan asks the giant mutant Stan to attack Shelley is based on Parker's childhood fantasy of having a larger version of himself beat up his sister. The resolution to the subplot, in which Shelley takes the blame for Stan's mistakes, and then beats up Stan when he tries to thank her, was also based on experiences Parker had when his <b>sister</b> <b>would</b> bail him out of trouble.|$|E

Griffin decided to create a Hangman-style game after recalling long car trips as a child, on which he and his <b>sister</b> <b>would</b> play Hangman. After he discussed the idea with Merv Griffin Enterprises' staff, they thought that the idea would work as a game show if it had a [...] "hook".

The case was settled for an undisclosed amount. In June 2003, Mathew Knowles announced that Destiny's Child would expand back to a quartet, revealing Knowles' younger sister, Solange, as the latest addition to the group. Destiny's Child had previously recorded songs with Solange and shared the stage when she temporarily replaced Rowland after she broke her toes while performing.
